      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION Robots are increasingly being used as our partners, working with and alongside people, whether it is serving as assistants in our homes [59], transporting cargo in warehouses [11], helping students with language learning in the classroom [28], and acting as guides in public spaces [23]. In order for humans and robots to work together effectively, robots must be able to communicate with their human partners in order to establish a shared understanding of the collaborative task and to coordinate their efforts [21, 17, 49, 48]. Natural language provides an efficient, flexible medium through which humans and robots can exchange information. Consider, for example, a search-and-rescue operation carried out by a human-robot team. The human may first issue spoken commands (e.g., “Search the rooms at the end of the hallway”) that direct one or more robots to navigate throughout the building searching for occupants [40, 53, 41]. In this process, the robot may engage the user in dialogue to resolve any ambiguity in the task (e.g., to clarify which hallway the user was referring to) [54, 15, 46, 55, 24]. The user’s ability to trust their robotic partners is also integral to effective collaboration [20], and a robot’s ability to generate natural language explanations\nof its progress (e.g., “I have inspected two rooms”) and decision-making processes have been shown to help establish trust [16, 2, 60].\nIn this paper, we specifically consider the surrogate problem of synthesizing natural language route instructions and describe a method that generates free-form directions that people can accurately and efficiently follow in environments unknown to them a priori (Fig. 1). This specific problem has previously been considered by the robotics community [18, 44] and is important for human-robot collaborative tasks, such as search-and-rescue, exploration, and surveillance [33], and for robotic assistants, such as those that serve as guides in museums, offices, and other public spaces. More generally, the problem is relevant beyond human-robot interaction to the broader domain of indoor navigation, for which GPS is unavailable and the few existing solutions that rely upon\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n03 16\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n1 O\nct 2\n01 6\ntemplate-based instructions, referring to distances and street names, are not suitable. There are two primary challenges to generating effective, natural language route instructions, which are characteristic of the more general problem of free-form generation.\nThe first challenge is content selection, the problem of deciding what and how much information to convey to the user as part of the directions. In general, the more detailed an instruction is, the less ambiguous it is. However, verbose instructions can be unnatural and hard for followers to remember and, thus, ineffective. Consequently, it is important to balance the value of including particular information as part of a route instruction with the cost that comes with increasing the level of detail. Further, not all information is equally informative. Existing commercial navigational solutions typically rely on a set of hand-crafted rules that consider only street names and metric distances as valid candidates, the latter of which requires that follower’s keep track of their progress. In contrast, studies have shown that people prefer route instructions that reference physical, salient landmarks in the environment [58]. However, no standard exists with regards to what and how these landmarks should be selected, as these depend on the nature of the environment and the demographics of the follower [61, 27].\nWe propose a method that models this content selection problem as a Markov decision process with a learned policy that decides what and how much to include in a formal language specification of the task (path). We learn this policy via inverse reinforcement learning from demonstrations of route instructions provided by humans. This avoids the need for hand-crafted selection rules and allows our method to automatically adapt to the preferences and communication style of the target populations and to simultaneously choose to convey information that minimizes the ambiguity of the instruction while avoiding verbosity.\nThe second challenge is surface realization, which is the task of synthesizing a natural language sentence that refers to the content selected in the first step. Existing solutions rely on sentence templates, generating sentences by populating manually defined fields (e.g., “turn 〈direction〉”) and then serializing these sentences in a turn-by-turn fashion. As expected, the use of such templates reduces coherence across sentences and limits the ability to adapt to different domains (e.g., from outdoor to indoor navigation). Additionally, while the output is technically correct, the resulting sentences tend to be rigid and unnatural. Studies show that language generated by a robot is most effective when it emulates the communication style that people use [56].\nWe address the surface realization problem through a neural sequence-to-sequence model that “translates” a formal language specification of the selected command into a natural language sentence. Our model takes the form of an encoderaligner-decoder architecture that first encodes the formal path specification with a recurrent neural network using long shortterm memory (LSTM-RNN) [25]. The model then decodes (translates) the resulting abstraction of the input into a natural\nlanguage sentence (word sequence), using an alignment mechanism to further refine the selected information and associate output words with the corresponding elements in the input formal specification. The use of LSTMs as the hidden units enables our model to capture the long-term dependencies that exist among the selected information and among the words in the resulting instruction. We train our surface realization model on instruction corpora, which enables our method to generate natural language directions that emulate the style of human instructions, without the need for templates, specialized features, or linguistic resources.\nWe evaluate our method on the benchmark SAIL dataset of human-generated route instructions [39]. Instructions generated with our method achieve a sentence-level BLEU score of 72.18%, indicating their similarity with the reference set of human-provided instructions. We perform a series of ablations and visualizations to better understand the contributions of the primary components of our model. We additionally conduct human evaluation experiments and demonstrate that our learning-based method generates instructions that people are able to follow as efficiently and accurately as those generated by humans. A qualitative assessment reveals that participants rate the quality of information conveyed by our instructions, the ease with which they are interpretable, and the participants’ confidence in following the instructions equivalent to and even better than those of human-generated directions."

      "heading" : "II. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Existing research related to the generation of route instructions spans the fields of robotics, natural language processing, cognitive science, and psychology. Early work in this area focuses on understanding the way in which humans generate natural language route instructions [61, 1, 38] and the properties that make “good” instructions easier for people to follow [36, 47, 58]. These studies have shown that people prefer to give directions as a sequence of turn-by-turn instructions and that they favor physical objects and locations as intuitive landmarks (as opposed to the quantified distances typical of GPS-based navigation systems).\nBased on these studies, much of the existing research on generating route instructions involves the use of handcrafted rules that are designed to emulate the manner in which people compose navigation instructions [50, 13]. Look et al. [36] compose route instructions using a set of templates and application rules engineered based upon a corpus of humangenerated route instructions. Look [37] improves upon this work by incorporating human cognitive spatial models to generate high-level route overviews that augment turn-by-turn directions. Similarly, Dale et al. [14] analyze a dataset of route instructions composed by people to derive a set of handdesigned rules that mimic the content and style of human directions. Goeddel and Olson [18] describe a particle filterbased method that employs a generative model of direction following to produce templated instructions that maximize the likelihood of reaching the desired destination.\nThe challenge with instruction generation systems that rely upon hand-crafted rules is that is difficult to design a policy that generalizes to a wide variety of scenarios and followers, whose preferences vary depending on such factors as their cultural background [27] and gender [61]. Cuayáhuitl et al. [12] seek to improve upon this using reinforcement learning with hand-crafted reward functions that model the length of the instructions and the likelihood that they will confuse a follower. They then learn a policy that reasons both over the best route and the corresponding navigational instructions. However, this approach still requires that domain experts define the reward functions and specify model parameters. In contrast, Oswald et al. [44] model the problem of deciding what to include in the instruction (i.e., the content selection problem) as a Markov decision process and learn a policy from a human-written navigation corpus using maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning. Given the content identified by the policy, their framework does not perform surface realization, and instead generates instructions by matching the selected content with the nearest match in a database of human-generated instructions. Our method also uses inverse reinforcement learning for content selection, but unlike their system, our method also learns to perform surface realization directly from corpora, thus generating newly-composed natural language instructions.\nRelatedly, much attention has been paid recently to the “inverse” problem of learning to follow (i.e., execute) natural language route instructions. Statistical methods primarily formulate the problem of converting instructions to actions as either a semantic parsing task [40, 9, 4] or as a symbol grounding problem [31, 53, 34, 26, 10]. Alternatively, Mei et al. [41] learn to translate natural language instructions to action sequences via an end-to-end fashion using an encoderaligner-decoder architecture.\nMeanwhile, selective generation considers the more general problem of converting a rich database to a natural language utterance, with existing methods generally focusing on the individual problems of content selection and surface realization. Barzilay and Lee [7] perform content selection on collections of unannotated documents for the sake of text summarization. Barzilay and Lapata [6] formulate content selection as a collective classification problem, simultaneously optimizing local label assignments and their pairwise relations. Liang et al. [35] consider the related problem of aligning elements of a database to textual description clauses. They propose a generative semi-Markov model that simultaneously segments text into utterances and aligns each utterance with its corresponding entry in the database. Meanwhile, Walker et al. [57] perform surface realization via sentence planners that can be trained to generate sentences for dialogue and context planning. Wong and Mooney [62] effectively invert a semantic parser to generate natural language sentences from formal meaning representations using synchronous context-free grammars. Rather than consider individual sub-problems, recent work focuses on solving selective generation via a single framework [8, 29, 3, 32, 42]. Angeli et al. [3] model content\nselection and surface realization as local decision problems via log-linear models and employ templates for generation. Mei et al. [42] formulate selective generation as an end-toend learning problem and propose a recurrent neural network encoder-aligner-decoder model that jointly learns to perform content selection and surface realization from database-text pairs."

      "heading" : "III. TASK DEFINITION",
      "text" : "We consider the problem of generating natural language instructions that allow humans to navigate environments that are unknown to them a priori. As with the broader class of language generation problems, this task requires deciding which information to convey to the user (content selection), such that it is correct (e.g., consistent with what is currently visible to the user in the environment), not overly verbose (i.e., so that users can easily interpret and remember the instruction), and unambiguous. The task then requires conveying this information via language, such that the sentence is syntactically correct, its semantics are consistent with the intended message, and it is natural and free-form.\nFormally, given a map of the environment and a desired path, the task is to produce a natural language instruction that guides the user along the path. The map m takes the form of a hybrid metric-topologic-semantic representation (Fig. 1) that encodes the position of and connectivity between a dense set of locations in the environment (e.g., intersections) and the position and type of objects and environment features (e.g., floor patterns). The path p is a sequences of poses (i.e., position and orientation) that corresponds to the minimum distance route from a given initial pose to a desired goal pose. We split the path according to changes in direction, representing the path p = (p1, p2, . . . pM ) as a sequence of intermediate segments pi.\nTraining data comes in the form of tuples (m(i), p(i),Λ(i)) for i = 1, 2, . . . , n drawn from human demonstrations, where m(i) is a map of the environment, Λ(i) is a human-generated natural language route instruction, and p(i) is the path that a different human took when following the instructions. At test time, we consider only the map and path pair as known and hold out the human-generated instruction for evaluation. The dataset that we use for training, validation, and testing comes from the benchmark SAIL corpus [39]."

      "heading" : "A. Compound Action Specifications",
      "text" : "In order to bridge the gap between the low-level nature of the input paths and the natural language output, we encode paths using an intermediate logic-based formal language. Specifically, we use the Compound Action Specification (CAS) representation [39], which provides a formal abstraction of navigation commands for hybrid metric-topologic-semantic maps such as ours. The CAS language consists of five actions (i.e., Travel, Turn, Face, Verify, and Find), each of which is associated with a number of attributes that together define specific commands (e.g., Travel.distance, Turn.direction). We distinguish between CAS structures, which are instructions with the attributes left empty (e.g., Turn(direction=None)) thereby defining a class of instructions, and CAS commands, which correspond to instantiated instructions with the attributes set to particular values (e.g., Turn(direction=Left)). For each English instruction Λ(i)) in the dataset, we generate the corresponding CAS command c(i) using the MARCO architecture [39].For a complete description of the CAS language, see MacMahon et al. [39]."
    }, {
      "heading" : "B. Content Selection",
      "text" : "There are many ways in which one can compose a CAS specification of the desired path, both in terms of the type of information that is conveyed (e.g., referencing distances vs. physical landmarks), as well as the specific references to use (e.g., different objects provide candidate landmarks). Humans exhibit common preferences in terms of the type of information that is shared (e.g., favoring visible landmarks over distances) [58], yet the specific nature of this information depends upon the environment and the followers’ demographics [61, 27]. Our goal is to learn these preferences from a dataset of instructions generated by humans.\n1) MDP with Inverse Reinforcement Learning: In similar fashion to Oswald et al. [44], we formulate the content selection problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with a goal of then identifying an information selection policy that maximizes long-term cumulative reward consistent with human preferences (Fig. 2). However, this reward function is unknown a priori and generally difficult to define. We assume that humans optimize a common reward function when composing instructions and employ inverse reinforcement learning to learn a policy that mimics the preferences that humans exhibit based upon a set of human demonstrations.\nAn MDP is defined by the tuple (S,A,R, P, γ), where S is a set of states, A is a set of actions, R(s, a, s′) ∈ R is the reward received when executing action a ∈ A in state s ∈ S and transitioning to state s′ ∈ S, P (s′|a, s) is the probability\nof transitioning from state s to state s′ when executing action a, and γ ∈ (0, 1] is the discount factor. The policy π(a|s) corresponds to a distribution over actions given the current state. In the case of the route instruction domain, the state s defines the user’s pose and path in the context of the map of the environment. We represent the state in terms of 14 context features that express characteristics such as changes in orientation and position, the relative location of objects, and nearby environment features (e.g., floor color). We encode the state s as a 14-dimensional binary vector that indicates which context features are active for that state. In this way, the state space S is that spanned by all possible instantiations of context features. Meanwhile, the action space corresponds to the space of different CAS structures (i.e., without instantiated attributes) that can be used to define the path.\nWe seek a policy π(a|s) that maximizes expected cumulative reward. However, the reward function that defines the value of particular characteristics of the instruction is unknown and difficult to define. For that reason, we frame the task as an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem using humanprovided route instructions as demonstrations of the optimal policy. Specifically, we learn a policy using the maximum entropy formulation of IRL [63], which models user actions as a distribution over paths parameterized as a log-linear model P (a; θ) ∝ e−θ>ξ(a), where ξ(a) is a feature vector defined over actions. We consider 9 instruction features (properties) that include features expressing the number of landmarks included in the instruction, the frame of reference that is used, and the complexity of the command. The feature vector ξ(a) then takes the form of a 9-dimensional binary vector. Appendix A presents the full set of context and property features used to parameterize the state and action, respectively. Maximum entropy IRL then solves for the distribution via the following optimization\nP (a; θ∗) = arg max θ P (a; θ) logP (a; θ)\ns.t. ξg = E[ξ(a)], (1)\nwhere ξg denotes the features from the demonstrations and the expectation is taken over the action distribution. For further details regarding maximum entropy IRL, we refer the reader to Ziebart et al. [63].\nThe policy defines a distribution over CAS structure compositions (i.e., using the Verify action vs. the Turn action) in terms of their feature encoding. We perform inference over this policy to identify the maximum a posteriori property vector ξ(a∗) = arg maxξ π. As there is no way to invert the feature mapping, we then match this vector ξ(a∗) to a database of CAS structures formed from our training set. Rather than choosing the nearest match, which may result in an inconsistent CAS structure, we retrieve the kc nearest neighbors from the database using a weighted distance in terms of mutual information [44] that expresses the importance of different CAS features based upon the context. As several of these may be valid, we employ spectral clustering using the similarity of the CAS strings to identify a set of candidate\nCAS structures Cs. 2) Sentence Planning: Given the set of candidate CAS structures Cs, our method next chooses the attributes values such that the final CAS commands are both valid and not ambiguous. We can compute the likelihood of a command c to be a valid instruction for a path p defined on a map m as:\nP (c|p,m) = δ(c|p,m)∑K j=1 δ(c|p̂j ,m) . (2)\nThe index j iterates over all the possible paths that have the same starting pose of p and δ(c | p,m) is defined as:\nδ(c|p,m) = {\n1 if η(c) = φ(c, p,m) 0 otherwise\nwhere η(c) is the number of attributes defined in c, and φ(c, p,m) is the number of attributes defined in c that are also valid with respect to the inputs p,m.\nFor each candidate CAS structure c ∈ Cs, we generate multiple CAS commands by iterating over the possible attributes values. We evaluate the correctness and ambiguity of each configuration according to Equation 2. A command is deemed valid if its likelihood is greater than a threshold Pt. Since the number of possible configurations for a structure increases exponentially with respect to the number of attributes, we assign attributes using greedy search. The iteration algorithm is constrained to use only objects and properties of the environment visible to the follower. The result is a set C of valid CAS commands."

      "text" : "Having identified a set of CAS commands suitable to the given path, our method then proceeds to generate the corresponding natural language route instruction. We formulate this problem as one of “translating” the instruction specification in the formal CAS language into its natural language equivalent.1 We perform this translation using an encoder-aligner-decoder model (Fig. 3) that enables our framework to generate natural language instructions by learning from examples of humangenerated instructions, without the need for specialized features, resources, or templates.\n1Related work [40, 4, 41] similarly models the inverse task of language understanding as a machine translation problem.\n1) Sequence-to-Sequence Model: We formulate the problem of generating natural language route instructions as inference over a probabilistic model P (λ1:T |x1:N ), where λ1:T = (λ1, λ2, . . . , λT ) is the sequence of words in the instruction and x1:N = (x1, x2, . . . xN ) is the sequence of tokens in the CAS command. The CAS sequence includes a token for each action (e.g., Turn, Travel) and a set of tokens with the form attribute.value for each couple (attribute,value); for example, Turn(direction=Right) is represented by the sequence (Turn, direction.Right). Generating an instruction sequence then corresponds to inference over this model\nλ∗1:T = arg max λ1:T P (λ1:T |x1:N ) (3a)\n= arg max λ1:T T∏ t=1 P (λt|λ1:t−1, x1:N ) (3b)\nWe model this task as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, whereby we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to first encode the input CAS command\nhj = f(xj , hj−1) (4a) zt = b(h1, h2, . . . hN ), (4b)\nwhere hj is the encoder hidden state for CAS token j, and f and b are nonlinear functions, which we define later. An aligner computes the context vector zt that encodes the language instruction at time t ∈ {1, . . . , T}. An RNN decodes the context vector zt to arrive at the desired likelihood (Eqn. 3)\nP (λt|λ1:t−1, x1:N ) = g(dt−1, zt), (5)\nwhere dt−1 is the decoder hidden state at time t− 1, and g is a nonlinear function.\nEncoder Our encoder (Fig. 3) takes as input the sequence of tokens in the CAS command x1:N . We transform each token xi into a ke−dimensional binary vector using a word embedding representation [43]. We feed this sequence into an RNN encoder that employs LSTMs as the recurrent unit as a result of their ability to learn long-term dependencies among the instruction sequences, without being prone to vanishing or exploding gradients. The LSTM-RNN encoder summarizes the relationship between elements of the CAS command and yields a sequence of hidden states h1:N = (h1, h2, . . . , hN ), where hj encodes CAS words up to and including xj . In practice, we reverse the input sequence before feeding it into\nthe neural encoder, which has been demonstrated to improve performance for other neural translation tasks [52].\nOur encoder is similar to that of Graves et al. [19], iej fej oej gej  =  σ σ σ tanh T e( xjhj−1 ) (6a)\ncej = f e j cej−1 + iej gej (6b) hj = o e j tanh(cej) (6c)\nwhere T e is an affine transformation, σ is the logistic sigmoid that restricts its input to [0, 1], iej , f e j , and o e j are the input, output, and forget gates of the LSTM, respectively, and cej is the memory cell activation vector. The memory cell cej summarizes the LSTM’s previous memory cej−1 and the current input, which are modulated by the forget and input gates, respectively.\nAligner Having encoded the input CAS command into a sequence of hidden annotations h1:N , the decoder then seeks to generate a natural language instruction as a sequence of words. We employ an alignment mechanism [5] (Fig. 3) that permits our model to match and focus on particular elements of the CAS sequence that are salient to the current word in the output instruction. We compute the context vector as\nzt = ∑ j αtjhj . (7)\nThe weight αtj associated with the j-th hidden state is αtj = exp(βtj)/ ∑ k exp(βtk), (8)\nwhere the alignment term βtk = f(dt−1, hj) expresses the degree to which the CAS element at position j and those around it match the output at time t. The term dt−1 represents the decoder hidden state at the previous time step. The alignment is modeled as a one-layer neural perceptron\nβtk = v > tanh(Wdt−1 + V hj), (9)\nwhere v, W , and V are learned parameters.\nDecoder Our model employs an LSTM decoder (Fig. 3) that takes as input the context vector zt and the decoder hidden state at the previous time step dt−1 and outputs the conditional probability distribution Pλ,t = P (λt|λ1:t−1, x1:N ) over the next token as a deep output layer\nidt fdt odt gdt\n =  σ σ σ\ntanh\nT d(dt−1zt )\n(10a)\ncdt = f d t cdt−1 + idt gdt (10b) dt = o d t tanh(cdt ) (10c)\nqt = L0(Lddt + Lzzt) (10d) Pλ,t = softmax (qt) (10e)\nwhere L0, Ld, and Lz are parameters to be learned.\nTraining We train our encoder-aligner-decoder model so as to predict the natural language instruction λ∗1:T for a given input sequence x1:N using a training set of human-generated reference instructions. We use the negative log-likelihood of the reference instructions at each time step t as our loss function.\nInference Given a CAS command represented as a sequence of tokens x1:N , we generate a route instruction as the sequence of maximum a posteriori words λ∗1:T under our learned model (Eqn. 3). We use beam search to perform approximate inference, but have empirically found greedy search to often perform better.2 For that reason, we generate candidates using both greedy and beam search.\n2) Language Model: The inference procedure results in multiple candidate instructions for a given segment, and additional candidates may exist when there are multiple CAS specifications. We rank these candidate instructions using a language model (LM) trained on large amounts of English data. We formulate this LM as an LSTM-RNN [51] that assigns a perplexity score to each of the corresponding instructions.\nGiven the CAS specifications for a segmented path p = (p1, p2, . . . pM ), we generate the final instruction Λ by sequencing the M sentences {Λ?1, . . . ,Λ?M} (i.e., one for each path segment)\nΛ?i = arg min Λij L(Λij), (11)\nwhere Λij is the j-th candidate for the i-th segment and L(Λij) is the perplexity score assigned by the language model to the sentence Λij ."

In order to overcome this scarcity, we augmented the original dataset using a set of rules. In particular, for each command-instruction (c(i),Λ(i)) pair in the original dataset we generate a number of new demonstrations iterating over the set of possible values for each attribute in the command and updating the relative instruction accordingly. For example, given the original pair (Turn(direction=Left), “turn left”), we augment the dataset with 2 new pairs, namely (Turn(direction=Right), “turn right”) and (Turn(direction=Back), “turn back”). Our augmented dataset consists of about 750k and 190k demonstrations for training and validation, respectively.\nB.

The encoder-alignerdecoder consisted of 2 layers for the encoder and decoder with 128 LSTM units per layer. The language model similarly included a 2-layer recurrent neural network with 128 LSTM units per layer. The size of the CAS and natural (English) language vocabularies was 88 and 435, respectively, based upon the SAIL dataset. All parameters were chosen based on the performance on the validation set. We train our model using Adam [30] for optimization. At test time, we perform approximate inference using a beam width of two. Our method requires an average of 33 s (16 s without beam search) to generate instructions for a path consisting of 9 movements when run on a laptop with a 2.0 GHz CPU and 8 GB of RAM.

We evaluate the contribution of the aligner by implementing and training an alternative model in which the last encoder hidden state is fed to the decoder. Table I compares the performance of the two models on the original validation set. The inclusion of an aligner results in a slight increase in the BLEU score of the generated instructions relative to the human-provided references, and is also useful as a means of visualizing the inner workings of our model (as shown below). Additionally, we empirically find that the aligner improves our model’s ability to learn the association between CAS elements and words in the output, thereby yielding better instructions."

In practice, the language model, trained on large amounts of English data, helps to remove grammatically incorrect sentences produced by the sequence-to-sequence model, which is only trained on the smaller pairwise dataset. Table II presents two instruction candidates generated by our encoder-aligner-decoder model for two different CAS commands.

For example, the network learns the association between the honeycomb textured floor and its color (top); that “bench” refers to sofa objects (bottom); and that the phrase “you should have” indicates a verification action (top)."

      "text" : "We evaluate the accuracy with which human participants followed the natural language instructions in terms of the Manhattan distance d between the desired destination (i.e., the last pose of the target path) and the participant’s location when s/he finished the scenario. Figure 6 compares the accuracy of the participants’ paths when following human-generated instructions (i.e., those from the SAIL test dataset) with those corresponding to instructions that our method produced. We report the fraction of times that participants finished within different distances from the goal.3 The results demonstrate that participants reached the desired position 4% more often when following instructions generated using our method compared against the human instruction baseline. When they didn’t reach the destination, participants reached a location within one vertex away 8% more often given our instructions. Meanwhile our method yields a failure rate (d > 2) that is 6% lower. Note that of scenarios in which participants reached the destination, the total time required to interpret and follow our method’s instructions is 9.52 s less than that of the humangenerated instructions, though the difference is not statistically significant.\nFigure 7 presents the participants’ responses to the survey questions that query their experience following the instructions. By using IRL to learn a content selection policy for constructing CAS structures, our method generates instructions that convey enough information to follow the command\n3We note that the d = 0 accuracy for the human-generated instructions is consistent with that reported elsewhere [9].\nand were rated as providing too little information 15% less frequently than the human-generated baseline (Fig. 7(a)). Meanwhile, participants felt that our instructions were easier to follow (Fig. 7(b)) than the human-generated baselines (72% vs. 52% rated as “easy” or “very easy” for our method vs. the baseline). Participants were more confident in their ability to follow our method’s instructions (Fig. 7(c)) and felt that they had to backtrack less often (Fig. 7(d)). Meanwhile, both types of instructions were confused equally often as being machinegenerated (Fig. 7(e)), however participants were less sure of who generated our instructions relative to the human baseline.\nFigure 8 compares the paths that participants took when following our instructions with those that they took given the reference human-generated directions. In the case of the map on the left (Fig. 8(a)), none of the five participants reached the correct destination (indicated by a “G”) when\nfollowing the human-generated instruction. One participant reached location 2, three participants stopped at location 3 (one of whom backtracked after reaching the end of the hallway above the goal), and one participant went in the wrong direction at the outset. In contrast, all five participants reached the goal directly (i.e., without backtracking) when following our instruction. For the scenario depicted on the right (Fig. 8(b)), five participants failed to reach the destination when provided with the human-generated instruction. Two of the participants went directly to location 1, two participants navigated to location 2, and one participant went to location 2 before backtracking and taking a right to location 1. We attribute the failures to the ambiguity in the human-generated instruction that references “fish walled areas,” which could correspond to most of the hallways in this portion of the map\n(as denoted by the pink colored lines). On the other hand, each of the five participants followed the intended path (shown in green) and reached the goal when following the instruction generated using our method. We note that the second-best candidate that our framework considered mentions the “olive hallway” as a unique reference to where the person should take a left."

      "heading" : "VII. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We presented a model for natural language generation in the context of providing indoor route instructions that exploits a structured approach to produce unambiguous, easy to remember and grammatically correct human-like route instructions. Currently, our model generates natural language route instructions for the shortest path to the goal. Nevertheless, there are situations in which a longer path may afford instructions that are more straightforward [47] or that increase the likelihood of reaching the destination [22]. Another interesting direction for a future work would be to involve the integration of a model of instruction followers [41] with our architecture in an effort to learn to generate instructions that are easier to follow. Such an approach would permit training the model in a reinforcement learning setting, directly optimizing over task performance."

      "text" : "We evaluated the accuracy and quality of our generated instructions via a set of experiments in which human participants were asked to navigate a three-dimensional virtual environment according route instruction that was provided. Participants were recruited using the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing platform. The recruiting message said that the objective of the experiment was to understand how people follow route instructions. We offered $0.15 (USD) for each completed scenario. Fifty-four people participated and completed a total of 511 experiments. We omitted those experiments for which the participant answered “No” or “Do not disclose” to the question “Are you a native English speaker?”, since it was included as a requirement for participating. This procedure resulted in a total of 42 participants (21 females and 21 males, ages 18–64) and a total of 441 experiments. We did not omit experiments based on the participants’ performance or the answers they gave to questions regarding demographic information. We paid all the participants for their contribution, regardless of whether they were native English speakers. Prior to taking part, each participant spent at least 30 seconds navigating within a held-out environment in order to familiarize themselves with the interface. Each experimented lasted an average of 40 seconds. The route instructions were randomly sampled from those generated using our method and those provided by humans as part of the SAIL corpus. The following outlines the procedure that each participant then followed:\n1) The participant was presented with a virtual environment in which s/he was placed at the start position facing a random orientation, and given the route instructions. 2) The participant was asked to navigate according to the instruction using their keyboard’s arrow keys. 3) At any time, the participant could review the directions and a legend containing information about objects, pictures and floor colors found in the environment. 4) When the participant believed that s/he had reached the destination, s/he pressed the “Finish task” button. 5) The participant was presented with a survey consisting of eight questions, three requesting demographic information and five requesting feedback on their experience and the quality of the instructions that they followed."

Natural language provides a flexible and efficient medium through which robots can exchange information with their human partners. Significant advancements have been made in developing robots capable of interpreting free-form instructions, but less attention has been devoted to endowing robots with the ability to generate natural language. We propose a navigational guide model that enables robots to generate natural language instructions that allow humans to navigate a priori unknown environments. We first decide which information to share with the user according to their preferences, using a policy trained from human demonstrations via inverse reinforcement learning. We then “translate” this information into a natural language instruction using a neural sequence-tosequence model that learns to generate free-form instructions from natural language corpora. We evaluate our method on a benchmark route instruction dataset and achieve a BLEU score of 72.18% when compared to human-generated reference instructions. We additionally conduct navigation experiments with human participants that demonstrate that our method generates instructions that people follow as accurately and easily as those produced by humans.",
