      "text" : "chine\nThe SP theory, which has been under development for several years, aims to simplify and integrate concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme.\nThe theory is conceived as an abstract brain-like system that, in an ‘input’ perspective, may receive ‘New’ information via its senses, and compress some or all of it to create ‘Old’ information, as illustrated schematically in Figure 1. In the theory, information compression is the mechanism both for the learning and organisation of knowledge and for pattern recognition, reasoning, problem-solving, and more.\nIn the SP theory, all kinds of knowledge are represented with patterns: arrays of atomic symbols in one or two dimensions. A key part of the system\nis a concept of multiple alignment, like that shown in Figure 2.1\nThe SP theory is realised in a computer model, SP70, which may be regarded as a first version of the SP machine. It is envisaged that the SP computer model will provide the basis for the development of a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine, as shown schematically in Figure 3. This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it.\n1The concept of multiple alignment in the SP system ([14, Section 4]; [10, Section 3.4]) is borrowed from that concept in bioinformatics, but with important differences.\nThe SP system provides a model for several aspects of computing and cognition, including unsupervised learning, concepts of computing, aspects of mathematics and logic, the representation of knowledge, natural language processing, pattern recognition, several kinds of reasoning, information storage and retrieval, planning and problem solving, and aspects of neuroscience and of human perception and cognition [14, 10].\nThere is a relatively full account of the SP system in [10], an extended overview in [14], an account of its existing and expected benefits and applications in [15], a description of its foundations in [12], and an introduction to the system in [13]. There is more information in www.cognitionresearch.org/sp.htm."

      "text" : "“While traditional computers must be programmed by humans to perform specific tasks, cognitive systems will learn from their interactions with data and humans and be able to, in a sense, program themselves to perform new tasks.” [3, p. 7].\nThe SP programme derives in part from earlier research developing computer models of language learning.2\nAt a fundamental level—compression of information via the matching and unification of patterns—the SP computer model works in the same way as the earlier models of language learning. Like the earlier models, the SP computer model is able to discover generative grammars from data, including segmental structure, classes of structure, and abstract patterns.\nBut in developing the SP system, a radical reorganisation has been needed to meet the goal of simplifying and integrating concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition. Unlike the earlier models, multiple alignment is central in the workings of the SP computer model, including unsupervised learning. A bonus of the new structure is potential for the unsupervised learning of class hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and discontinuous dependencies in data.\nThe emphasis on unsupervised learning in the SP programme of research is because of evidence that human learning, including the learning of natural languages, does not depend on the provision of a ‘teacher’, or anything equivalent—although such assistance may be helpful.\nA strength of the SP system is that it can discover significant entities, classes of entity, and other structures in data, not merely statistical asso-\n2See bit.ly/JCd6jm.\nciations between pre-established structures. An important idea in the SP programme is the ‘DONSVIC’ principle [14, Section 5.2]: the conjecture, supported by evidence, that information compression is the key to the discovery of ‘natural’ structures, meaning the kinds of things that people naturally recognise, such as words, objects, and classes of objects.\nLearning in the SP system has much of the flavour of:\n“[building and maintaining] a giant jigsaw puzzle on the fly, making connections between newly acquired data and older information.” [3, p. 55].\nand of:\n“... finding many needles in a field full of haystacks, combining those needles, then searching the smaller but still substantial collection for the needles made of gold—the truly valuable slivers of insight.” [3, p. 56]."

      "heading" : "4 Big data",
      "text" : "“The emergence of social networking, sensor networks, and huge storehouses of business, scientific, and government records creates an abundance of information tech-industry insiders call ‘big data’. ... This digital universe is growing at about 60 percent each year.” [3, p. 5].\n“We need a new generation of data storage, management, and analytics tools that will improve our ability to gather, meld, and make sense of huge amounts of data and, in some cases, to perform a complex ballet of tasks in real time.” [3, p. 45].\nThe SP system may assist in the management and analysis of big data in four main ways:\n• Helping to overcome the problem of variety in big data.\n“The manipulation and integration of heterogeneous data from different sources into a meaningful common representation is a major challenge.” [6, p. 76].3\n3See also the problem of variety described in [4] and [3, p. 45]\nThe versatility of SP patterns, within the multiple alignment framework, in the representation and processing of diverse kinds of knowledge ([14, Sections 5 to 13]; [10, Chapters 5 to 10]) makes them a contender for the role of “meaningful common representation” or universal format for knowledge. There is potential for the translation of heterogeneous data into that universal format, for harmonisation in the representation of different kinds of knowledge, and for automatic structuring of knowledge via processes for unsupervised learning (Section 3).\n• Interpretation. In the interpretation of data, the SP system has capabilities that include such things as natural language processing, several kinds of reasoning, planning, and problem solving. It has several strengths in pattern recognition, where recognition may be achieved: at multiple levels of abstraction; with “family resemblance” or polythetic categories; in the face of errors of omission, commission or substitution in data; with the calculation of a probability for any given identification, classification or associated inference; with sensitivity to context in recognition; and with the seamless integration of pattern recognition with other aspects of intelligence—reasoning, learning, problem solving, and so on ([14, Section 9]; [10, Chapter 6]).\n• Unsupervised learning. As outlined in Section 3, unsupervised learning is a key feature of the SP system. With big data, there is clear potential for the previously-mentioned DONSVIC principle: the discovery of natural structures via information compression [14, Section 5.2].\n• Information compression. Information compression is central in how the SP system works. Potential benefits with big data include:\n– Reducing the volume of data and thus facilitating its storage and management. In that connection, there are reasons to believe that the system may achieve higher levels of compression than conventional systems for information compression [15, Section 6.7].\n– By sending only ‘code’ and not ‘grammar’, there is potential for very substantial economies in the transmission of big data [15, Section 6.7.1]. There is more about this in Section 5.3.\n– It appears that information compression can mean substantial gains in computational efficiency, especially in the use of energy (Section 5).\n– In the SP system, information compression provides a key to the management of errors and uncertainty in data (Section 7).\n– Knowledge structures created by the system, including classinclusion hierarchies, part-whole hierarchies, and their integration [14, Section 9.1], may facilitate retrieval of information by serving, in effect, as hierarchical indices.\nHow the SP system may assist in the management and analysis of big data will be described more fully in a new article [7]."

      "text" : "compression\n“... we’re reaching the limits of our ability to make [gains in the capabilities of CPUs] at a time when we need even more computing power to deal with complexity and big data. And that’s putting unbearable demands on today’s computing technologies—mainly because today’s computers require so much energy to perform their work.” [3, p. 9].\n“The human brain is a marvel. A mere 20 watts of energy are required to power the 22 billion neurons in a brain that’s roughly the size of a grapefruit. To field a conventional computer with comparable cognitive capacity would require gigawatts of electricity and a machine the size of a football field. So, clearly, something has to change fundamentally in computing for sensing machines to help us make use of the millions of hours of video, billions of photographs, and countless sensory signals that surround us. ... Unless we can make computers many orders of magnitude more energy efficient, we’re not going to be able to use them extensively as our intelligent assistants.” [3, p. 75, p. 88].\nIn the quest for greater efficiency in processing, especially energy efficiency, the SP system may make what is potentially a very substantial contribution via information compression (this section) and via data-centric computing (Section 6).\nSince information processing in the SP system means compression of information via the matching and unification of patterns, anything that increases the efficiency of searching for good full and partial matches between patterns will also increase the efficiency of information processing.\nIt appears that information compression can itself be a means of increasing the efficiency of searching, as described in the next two subsections.\nInformation compression may also yield economies in the transmission of information (Section 5.3, below)."

The size of I may be reduced by replacing all but one of the instances of “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union” with a relatively short code like “TFEU”, and likewise other recurrent patterns. More generally, the size of I may be reduced via the compression processes in the SP system.\n• By searching with a short code like “TFEU” instead of a relatively large pattern like “Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union”. Other things being equal, a smaller search pattern means more efficient searching.\nWith regard to the second point, there is potential to cut out some searching altogether by “hard wiring” the connection between each instance of a code (“TFEU” in this example) and the thing that it represents (“Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union”). In SP-neural (Section 6.1), there are connections of that kind between “pattern assemblies”, as shown schematically in Figure 4."

      "text" : "likely to be found\nIf we want to find some strawberry jam, our search is more likely to be successful in a supermarket than it would be in an antiques shop or a showroom for second-hand cars. This may seem too simple and obvious to deserve comment but it illustrates the extraordinary knowledge that most people have of an informal ‘statistics’ of the world that we inhabit, and how that knowledge may help us to minimise effort.4\n4See also G. K. Zipf’s Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort [16].\nWhere does that statistical knowledge come from? In the SP theory, it flows directly from the central role of information compression in our perceptions, learning and thinking, and from the intimate relationship between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability [5].\nAlthough the SP computer model calculates probabilities for some purposes (see Section 7), it actually uses levels of information compression as a guide to search. Those levels are used, with heuristic search methods (including escape from ‘local peaks’), to ensure that searching is concentrated in areas where it is most likely to be fruitful [10, Sections 3.9, 3.10, and 9.2]. This not only speeds up processing but yields Big-O values for computational complexity that are within acceptable limits [10, Sections 3.10.6, 9.3.1, and A.4]."

      "text" : "“To control costs, designers of the [DOME] computing system have to figure out how to minimize the amount of energy used for processing data. At the same time, since so much of the energy in computing is required to move data around, they have to discover ways to move the data as little as possible.” [3, p. 65].\nAlthough this quote may refer in part to movements of data such as those between the CPU and the memory of a computer, the discussion here is about transmission of data over longer distances such as, for example, via the internet.\nAs was mentioned in Section 4, there is potential with the SP system for very substantial economies in the transmission of data [15, Section 6.7.1]. Any body of data, I, may be compressed by encoding it in terms a ‘grammar’ (G), provided that G contains the kinds of structures that are found in I (Section 7). Then I may be sent from A to B by sending only the ‘encoding’ (E). Provided that B has a copy of G, I may be recreated with complete fidelity by means of the SP system ([14, Section 4.5]; [10, Section 3.8]). Since E would normally be very much smaller than the I from which it was derived, it seems likely that there would be a net gain in efficiency, allowing for the computational costs of encoding and decoding.\nSince a copy of G must be transmitted to B, any savings will be relatively small if it is used only for the decoding of a single instance of E. But significant savings are likely if, as would normally be the case, one copy of G may be used for the decoding of many different instances of E, representing many different bodies of information."

Machines will perform computations faster, make sense of large amounts of data, and be more energy efficient.” [3, p. 88].\nThe SP concepts may help to integrate processing and memory, as described in the next two subsections."

It is envisaged that SP patterns would be realised with pattern assemblies—groupings of neurons like those shown in the figure within broken-line envelopes.\nThe whole scheme is quite different from ‘artificial neural networks’ as they are commonly conceived in computer science.5 It may be seen as a development of Donald Hebb’s [2] concept of a ‘cell assembly’, with more precision about how structures may be shared, and other differences.6\nIn SP-neural, the structure of knowledge is reflected directly in groupings of neurons and their interconnections, as shown in the figure. Although the details have not been worked out, it is envisaged that such things as pattern recognition would be achieved via the transmission of impulses between pattern assemblies, and via the transmission of impulses between neurons within each pattern assembly. In keeping with what is known about the workings of brains and nervous systems, it is likely that there would be important roles for both excitatory and inhibitory signals.\nIn short, neurons in SP-neural serve for both the representation and processing of knowledge, with close integration of the two—in accordance with the concept of data-centric computing."

This may be done with light, with the potential advantage that light beams may cross each other without interference. Another potential advantage is that, with collimated light, there may be relatively small losses over distance—although distances should probably be minimised to save on transmission times and to minimise the sizes of computing devices.

By contrast with Hebbian learning, the SP system, like a person, may learn from a single exposure to some situation or event. And, by contrast with Hebbian learning, it takes time to learn a language in the SP system because of the complexity of the search space, not because of any kind of gradual strengthening or “weighting” of links between neurons [10, Section 11.4.4].\n7“The most promising means of moving data faster is by harnessing photonics, the generation, transmission, and processing of light waves.” [3, p. 93].\ncal/electronic version of SP-neural. Finding good full and partial matches between patterns may also, potentially, be done with chemicals such as DNA,8 with potential for high levels of parallelism, and with the attraction that DNA can be a means of storing information in a very compact form, and for very long periods [1].\nWith both optical and chemical versions of the SP system, there seems to be potential for achieving data-centric integration of knowledge and processing."

      "heading" : "7 Errors and uncertainties in data",
      "text" : "“Organizations face huge challenges as they attempt to get their arms around the complex interactions between natural and human-made systems. The enemy is uncertainty. In the past, since computing systems didn’t handle uncertainty well, the tendency was to pretend that it didn’t exist. Today, it is clear that that approach won’t work anymore. So rather than trying to eliminate uncertainty, people have to embrace it.” [3, pp. 50–51].\nThe SP system has potential in the management of errors and uncertainties in data. In summary:\n• Owing to the previously-mentioned close connection between information compression and concepts of prediction and probability, the whole system is inherently probabilistic. Every SP pattern has an associated frequency of occurrence. From that information, a probability may be derived for each multiple alignment and for each of what are normally several inferences that may be derived from each multiple alignment ([14, Section 4.4]; [10, Section 3.7 and Chapter 7]).9\n• Unsupervised learning via information compression provides a neat solution to the problem of “dirty data” in the learning of a natural language ([14, Section 5.3]; [8]): how it is that we can develop a keen sense of what does or does not belong in our native language or languages, despite the fact that most of the speech that children hear contains the kinds of haphazard errors that people make in talking, and in the face\n8See, for example, “DNA computing”, Wikipedia, bit.ly/1gfEP4p, retrieved 2013-12- 30.\n9Although the SP system is fundamentally probabilistic, it can, if required, be constrained to yield all-or-nothing results, much as in a conventional computer [10, Chapter 10].\nof evidence that language learning may be achieved without the benefit of error correction by a teacher, or anything equivalent.\nIn brief, the product of learning comprises a ‘grammar’ (G) and an ‘encoding’ (E) of the original data in terms of the grammar. The two together achieve lossless compression of the original data, including all the errors. But G, which may be seen to capture the essence of the target language, excludes everything which is rare—which is mostly those haphazard errors that people make in speaking (these are rare individually, although collectively they are quite common). Anything that is a little more frequently-occurring than rare may acquire the status of linguistic irregularity—such as ‘bought’ (not ‘buyed’) as the past tense of ‘buy’—or it may be seen as a dialect form.\nThese principles apply to any kind of data, not just linguistic data.\n• In operations such as parsing natural language or pattern recognition, the SP system is robust in the face of errors of omission, of commission, or of substitution ([14, Section 4.2.2]; [10, Section 6.2.1]). In the same way that we can recognise things visually despite disturbances such as falling leaves or snow, or our own blinking (and likewise for other senses), the SP system can cope quite well with inputs that are not totally correct.\nAlthough there are advantages in using probabilities, the flipside—for both people and machines—is that mistakes can be made. We may bet on “Dancing Queen” but find that “Kiss me Kate” is the winner. In the same way that people can be fooled by a frequently-repeated lie, any probabilistic machine will be vulnerable to systematic distortions in data."

Even within IBM, our specialists in different sensing technologies don’t interact much. Yet if machines are to help humans understand the world, they have to make sense of it and communicate about it in a way that’s familiar and comprehensible to humans. This integration of data from various sensing technologies is beginning to happen in multimedia and visual analytics, where vision and sound are correlated. But that’s just the start of what will be required in the next era of computing.” [3, p. 74].\nThis quotation touches on an issue which is right at the heart of the SP programme of research: the need for simplification and integration of concepts across different fields. The SP theory aims to apply this principle across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and human perception and cognition.

In the SP system, information compression and a concept of multiple alignment are centre stage. The system is designed to integrate such things as unsupervised learning, pattern recognition, probabilistic reasoning, and more. It may help to overcome the problem of variety in big data, it may serve in pattern recognition and in the unsupervised learning of structure in data, and it may facilitate the management and transmission of big data. There is potential, via information compression, for substantial gains in computational efficiency, especially in the use of energy. The SP system may help to realise data-centric computing, perhaps via a development of Hebb’s concept of a ‘cell assembly’, or via the use of light or DNA for the processing of information. It has potential in the management of errors and uncertainty in data, in medical diagnosis, in processing streams of data, and in promoting adaptability in robots.",
