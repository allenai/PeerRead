Qualitative representations explicate relational knowledge between (spatial or temporal) domain entities, allowing individual statements to be evaluated by truth values. The aim of qualitative representations is to focus on the aspects that are essential for a task at hand by abstracting away from other, unimportant aspects. As a result, a wide range of representations has been applied, using various kinds of knowledge representation languages. The most fundamental principles for representing knowledge qualitatively that are at the heart of virtually every representation language are captured by a construct called qualitative spatial (or temporal) calculus. In the past decades, a great variety of qualitative calculi have been developed, each tailored to specific aspects of spatial or temporal knowledge. They share common principles but differ in formal and computational properties.\nThis article presents an up-to-date comprehensive overview of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning (QSTR). We provide a general definition of QSTR (Section 2), give a uniform account of a calculus that is more integrative than existing ones (Section 3), identify and differentiate algebraic properties of calculi (Section 4), and discuss their role within other knowledge representation paradigms (Section 5) as well as alternative approaches (Section 6). Besides the survey character, the article provides a taxonomy of the most prominent reasoning problems, a survey of all existing calculi proposed so far (to the best of our knowledge), and the first comprehensive overview of their computational properties.\nThis article is accompanied by an electronic appendix that contains minor technical details such as mathematical proofs of some claims and detailed experimental results.\nDemarcation of Scope and Contribution This article addresses researchers and engineers working with knowledge about space or time and wishing to employ reasoning on a symbolic level. We supply a thorough overview of the wealth of qualitative spatial and temporal calculi available, many of which have emerged from concrete application scenarios, for example, geographical information systems (GIS) [Egenhofer 1991; Frank 1991]; see also the overview given in [Ligozat 2011]. Our survey focuses on the calculi themselves (Tables IV–VI) and their computational and algebraic properties, i.e., characteristics relevant for reasoning and symbolic manipulation (Table VII, Figure 10). To this end, we also categorize reasoning tasks involving qualitative representations (Figure 2).\nWe exclusively consider qualitative formalisms for reasoning on the basis of finite sets of relations over an infinite spatial or temporal domain. As such, the mere use of symbolic labels is not surveyed. We also disregard approaches augmenting qualitative formalisms with an additional interpretation such as fuzzy sets or probability theory.\nThis article significantly advances from previous publications with a survey character in several regards. Ligozat [2011] describes in the course of the book “the main” qualitative calculi, describes their relations, complexity issues and selected techniques. Although an algebraic perspective is taken as well, we integrate this in a more general context. Additionally to mentioning general axioms in context of relation algebras we present a thorough investigation of calculi regarding these axioms. He also gives references to applications that employ QSTR techniques in a broad sense. Our survey supplements precise definitions of the underlying formal aspects, which will then be general enough to encompass all existing calculi that we are aware of. Chen et al. [2013] summarize the progress in QSTR by presenting selected key calculi for important spatial aspects. They give a brief introduction to basic properties of calculi, but neither detail formal properties nor picture the entire variety of formalisms achieved so far as provided by this article. Algebra-based methods for reasoning with qualitative constraint calculi have been covered by Renz and Nebel [2007]. Their description applies to calculi that satisfy rather strong properties, which we relax. We present revised\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\ndefinitions and an algebraic closure algorithm that generalizes to all existing calculi, and, to the best of our knowledge, we give the first comprehensive overview on computational properties. Cohn and Renz [2008] present an introduction to the field which extends the earlier article of Cohn and Hazarika [2001] by a more detailed discussion of logic theories for mereotopology and by presenting efficient reasoning algorithms."

      "text" : "We characterize QSTR by considering the reasoning problems it is concerned with. Generally speaking, reasoning is a process to generate new knowledge from existing one. Knowledge primarily refers to facts given explicitly, possibly implicating implicit ones. Sound reasoning is involved with explicating the implicit, allowing it to be processed further. Thus sound reasoning is crucial for many applications. In QSTR it is a key characteristic and the applied reasoning methods are largely shaped by the specifics of qualitative knowledge about spatial and temporal domains as provided within the qualitative domain representation."

      "heading" : "2.1. A General Definition of QSTR",
      "text" : "Qualitative domain representations employ symbols to represent semantically meaningful properties of a perceived domain, abstracting away any details not regarded relevant to the context at hand. The perceived domain comprises the available raw information about objects. By qualitative abstraction, the perceived domain is mapped to the qualitative domain representation, called domain representation from now on. Various aims motivate research on qualitative abstractions, most importantly the desire to develop formal models of common sense relying on coarse concepts [Williams and de Kleer 1991; Bredeweg and Struss 2004] and to capture the catalog of concepts and inference patterns in human cognition [Kuipers 1978; Knauff et al. 2004], which in combination enables intuitive approaches to designing intelligent systems [Davis 1990] or human-centered computing [Frank 1992]. Within QSTR it is required that qualitative abstraction yields a finite set of elementary concepts. The following definition aims to encompass all contexts in which QSTR is studied in the literature.\nDefinition 2.1. Qualitative spatial and temporal representation and reasoning (QSTR) is the study of techniques for representing and manipulating spatial and temporal knowledge by means of relational languages that use a finite set of symbols. These symbols stand for classes of semantically meaningful properties of the represented domain (positions, directions, etc.).\nSpatial and temporal domains are typically infinite and exhibit complex structures. Due to their richness and diversity, QSTR is confronted with unique theoretic and computational challenges. Consequently, there is a high variety of domain representations, each focusing on specific aspects relevant to specific tasks. In infinite domains, concepts that are meaningful to a wide range of settings are typically relative since there are no universally ‘important’ values. As a consequence, QSTR is involved with relations, using a relational language to formulate domain representations. It turns out that binary relations can capture most relevant facets of space and time – this class also received most attention by the research community. Expressive power is purely based on these pre-defined relations, no conjuncts or quantifiers are considered. Thus the associated reasoning methods can be regarded as variants of constraint-based reasoning. Additionally, constraint-based reasoning techniques can be used to empower other methods, for example to assess the similarity of represented entities or logic inference.\nFinally, to map a domain representation to the perceived domain a realization process is applied. This process instantiates entities in the perceived domain that are based on entities provided in the domain representation.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nFigure 1 depicts the overall view on knowledge representation and aligns with the well-known view on intelligent agents considered in AI, which connects the environment to the agent and its internal representation by means of perception (which is an abstraction process as well) and, vice versa, by actions (see, e.g., [Russell and Norvig 2009, Chapter 2])."

      "heading" : "2.2. Taxonomy of Constraint-Based Reasoning Tasks",
      "text" : "Figure 2 depicts an overview of constraint-based reasoning tasks in the context of QSTR. We now briefly describe these tasks and highlight some associated literature. The description is deliberately provided at an abstract level: each task may come in different flavors, depending on specific (application) contexts. Also, applicability of specific algorithms largely depends on the qualitative representation at hand. The following taxonomy is loosely based on the overview by Wallgrün et al. [2013].\nIn the following, we refer to the set of objects received from the perceived domain by applying qualitative abstraction as domain entities. These are for example geometric entities such as points, lines, or polygons. In general domain entities can be of any type regarding spatial or temporal aspects.\nWe further use the notion of a qualitative constraint network (QCN), which is a special form of abstract representation. Commonly, a QCN Q is depicted as a directed labeled graph, with nodes representing abstract domain entities, i.e., with no specific values from the domain assigned, and edges being labeled with constraints: symbols representing relationships that have to hold between these entities, e.g., see Figure 3(b). An assignment of concrete domain entities to the nodes in Q is called a solution of Q if the assigned entities satisfy all constraints in Q. Section 3.2 contains precise definitions.\nConstraint network generation. This task determines relational statements that describe given domain entities regarding specific aspects, using a predetermined qualitative language fulfilling certain properties, i.e., in our case provided by a qualitative spatial calculus. For instance, Figure 3(b) could be the constraint network derived from the scene shown in Figure 3(a). Techniques are given, e.g., by Cohn et al. [1997], Worboys and Duckham [2004], Forbus et al. [2004], and Dylla and Wallgrün [2007].\nConsistency checking. This decision problem is considered the fundamental QSTR task [Renz and Nebel 2007]: given an input QCN Q, decide whether a solution exists. Applicable algorithms depend on the kind of constraints that occur in Q and are addressed in Sections 3.2 and 3.4.\nModel generation. This task determines a solution for a QCN Q, i.e., a concrete assignment of a domain entity for each node in Q. This may be computationally harder than merely deciding the existence of a solution. For instance, Fig. 3(a) could be the result of the model generation for the QCN shown in Fig. 3(c). Typically, a single QCN has infinitely many solutions, due to the abstract nature of qualitative representations. Implementations of model generation may thus choose to introduce further parameters for controlling the kind of solution determined. Techniques are described, e.g., in [Schultz and Bhatt 2012; Kreutzmann and Wolter 2014; Schockaert and Li 2015].\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nEquivalence transformation. Taking a QCN Q as input, equivalence transformation methods determine a QCN Q′ that has exactly the same solutions but meets additional criteria. Two variants are commonly considered.\nSmallest equivalent network representation determines the strongest refinement of the input Q by modifying its constraints in order to remove redundant information. Figure 3(b) depicts a refinement of Figure 3(c) since in 3(c) the relation between A and C is not constrained at all (i.e., being “<,=, >”), whereas 3(b) involves the tighter constraint “<”. Thus, the QCN Q in 3(c) contains 5 base relations, whereas the QCN Q′ in 3(b) contains only 3. Methods are addressed, e.g., by van Beek [1991], and Amaneddine and Condotta [2013].\nMost compact equivalent network representation determines a QCN Q′ with a minimal number of constraints: it removes whole constraints that are redundant. In that sense, Figure 3(c) shows a more compact network than Figure 3(b). This task is addressed, e.g., by Wallgrün [2012], and Duckham et al. [2014].\nWith this taxonomy in mind, the next section studies properties of qualitative representations and their reasoning operations."

      "text" : "The notion of a qualitative spatial (or temporal) calculus is a formal construct which, in one form or another, underlies virtually every language for qualitative domain representations. In this section, we survey this fundamental construct, formulate minimal requirements to a qualitative calculus, discuss their relevance to spatial and temporal representation and reasoning, and list calculi described in the literature. As mentioned in Section 2.2 domain entities can be of any type representing spatial or temporal aspects. As specific domain entities are rather impedimental to define a general notion\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nof ’calculus’ we omit a list of entities here. Instead we refer to Table IV listing entities which are covered by existing calculi so far.\nExisting spatial and temporal calculi are entirely based on binary or ternary relations between spatial and temporal entities, which comprise, for example, points, lines, intervals, or regions. Binary relations are used to represent the location or moving direction of two entities relative to one another without referring to a third entity as a reference object. Examples of relations are “overlaps with” (for intervals or regions) or “move towards each other” (for dynamic objects). Additionally, a binary calculus is equipped with a converse operation acting on single relation symbols and a binary composition operation acting on pairs of relation symbols, representing the natural converse and composition operations on the domain relations, respectively. Converse and composition play a crucial role for symbolic reasoning: from the knowledge that the pair (x, y) of entities is in relation r, a symbolic reasoner can conclude that (y, x) is in the converse of r; and if it is additionally known that the pair (y, z) is in s, then the reasoner can conclude that (x, z) is in the relation resulting in composing r and s. In addition, most calculi provide an identity relation which allows to represent the (explicit or derived) knowledge that, for example, x and y represent the same entity.\nExample 3.1. The one-dimensional point calculus PC1 [Vilain and Kautz 1986] symbolically represents the relations <,=, > between points on a line (which may model points in time), see Figure 4 (a). These three relations are called base relations in Def. 3.4; PC1 additionally represents all their unions and intersections: the empty relation and 6,>, 6=,S. The calculus provides the relation symbols <, =, and >; sets of symbols represent unions of base relations, e.g., {<, =} represents 6. The symbol = represents the identity = .\nPC1 further provides converse and composition. For example, the converse of < is >: whenever x < y, it follows that y > x; the composition of < with itself is again <: whenever x < y and y < z, we have x < z. PC1 represents the converse as a list of size 3 (the converses of all relation symbols) and the composition as a table of size 3 × 3 (one composition result for each pair of relation symbols). •\nExample 3.2. The calculus RCC-5 [Randell et al. 1992] symbolically represents five binary topological relations between regions in space (which may model objects): “is discrete from”, “partially overlaps with”, “equals”, “is proper part of”, and “has proper\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\npart”, plus their unions and intersections, see Figure 4 (b). For this purpose, RCC-5 provides the relation symbols DC, PO, EQ, PP, and PPi. The latter two are each other’s converses; the first three are their own converses. The composition of DC and PO is {DC, PO, PP} because, whenever region x is disconnected from y and y partially overlaps with z, there are three possible configurations between x and z: those represented by DC, PO, PP. •\nExample 3.3. The calculus CYCb [Isli and Cohn 2000] symbolically represents four binary topological relations between orientations of points in the plane (which may model observers and their lines of vision): “equals”, “is opposite to”, and “is to the left/right of”, plus their unions and intersections, see Figure 4 (c). For this purpose, CYCb provides the relation symbols e, o, l, and r. The latter two are each other’s converses; e and o are their own converses. The composition of l and r is {e, l, r}: whenever orientation x is to the left of y and y is to the left of z, then x can be equal to, to the left of, or to the right of z. • Depending on the properties postulated for converse and composition, notions of a calculus of varying strengths exist [Nebel and Scivos 2002; Ligozat and Renz 2004]. The algebraic properties of binary calculi are well-understood, see Section 4.\nThe main motivation for using ternary relations is the requirement of directly capturing relative frames of reference which occur in natural language semantics [Levinson 2003]. In these frames of reference, the location of a target object is described from the perspective of an observer with respect to a reference object. For example, a hiker may describe a mountain peak to be to the left of a lake with respect to her own point of view. Another important motivation is the ability to express that an object is located between two others. Thus, ternary calculi typically contain projective relations for describing relative orientation and/or betweenness. The commitment to ternary (or n-ary) relations complicates matters significantly: instead of a single converse operation, there are now five (or n! − 1) nontrivial permutation operations, and there is no longer a unique choice for a natural composition operation. For capturing the algebraic structure of n-ary relations, Condotta et al. [2006] proposed an algebra but there are other arguably natural choices, and they lead to different algebraic properties, as shown in Section 4. These difficulties may be the main reason why algebraic properties of ternary calculi are not as deeply studied as for binary calculi. Fortunately, this will not prevent us from establishing our general notion of a qualitative spatial (or temporal) calculus with relation symbols of arbitrary arity. However, we will then restrict our algebraic study to binary calculi; a unifying algebraic framework for n-ary calculi has yet to be established."

      "heading" : "3.1. Requirements to Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Calculi",
      "text" : "We start with minimal requirements used in the literature. We use the following standard notation. A universe is a non-empty set U . With Xn we denote the set of all ntuples with elements from X. An n-ary domain relation is a subset r ⊆ Un. We use the prefix notation r(x1, . . . , xn) to express (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ r; in the binary case we will often use the infix notation x r y instead of r(x, y).\nAbstract partition schemes. Ligozat and Renz [2004] note that most spatial and temporal calculi are based on a set of JEPD (jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint) domain relations. The following definition is predominant in the QSTR literature [Ligozat and Renz 2004; Cohn and Renz 2008].\nDefinition 3.4. Let U be a universe and R a set of non-empty domain relations of the same arity n. R is called a set of JEPD relations over U if the relations in R are jointly exhaustive, i.e., Un = ⋃ r∈R r, and pairwise disjoint.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nAn n-ary abstract partition scheme is a pair (U ,R) whereR is a set of JEPD relations over the universe U . The relations in R are called base relations.\nExample 3.5. The calculus PC1 is based on the binary abstract partition scheme S(PC1) := (R, {<,=, >}) where R is the set of reals and {<,=, >} is clearly JEPD. For RCC-5, the universe is often chosen to be the set of all regular closed subsets of the 2- or 3-dimensional space R2 or R3. The five base relations from Figure 4 (b) are JEPD. For CYCb, the universe is the set of all oriented line segments in the plane R2, given by angles between 0° and 360°. The four base relations from Figure 4 (c) are JEPD. •\nIn Definition 3.4, the universe U represents the set of all spatial (or temporal) entities. The main ingredients of a calculus will be relation symbols representing the base relations in the underlying partition scheme. A constraint linking an n-tuple t of entities via a relation symbol will thus represent complete information (modulo the qualitative abstraction underlying the partition scheme) about t. Incomplete information is modeled by t being in a composite relation, which is a set of relation symbols representing the union of the corresponding base relations. The set of all relation symbols represents the universal relation (the union of all base relations) and indicates that no information is available.\nExample 3.6. In PC1, “x < y” represents the relationship a < b, which holds complete information because < is atomic in S(PC1). The statement “x {<, =} y” represents the coarser relationship a 6 b holding the incomplete information “a < b or a = b”. Clearly “x {<, =, >} y” holds no information: “a < b or a = b or a > b” is always true. •\nThe requirement that all base relations are JEPD ensures that every n-tuple of entities belongs to exactly one base relation. Thanks to PD (pairwise disjointness), there is a unique way to represent any composite relation using relation symbols and, due to JE (joint exhaustiveness), the empty relation can never occur in a consistent set of constraints, which is relevant for reasoning, see Section 3.2.\nExample 3.7. Consider the modification PC′1 based on the non-PD set {6,>}. Then the relationship a = b can be expressed in two ways using relation symbols <= and >= representing 6 and >: “x <= y” and “x >= y”.\nConversely, consider the variant PC′′1 based on the non-JE set {<,>}. Then the constraint a = b cannot be expressed. Therefore, in any given set of constraints where it is known that x, y stand for identical entities, we would find the empty relation between x, y. The standard reasoning procedure described in Section 3.2 would declare such sets of constraints to be inconsistent, although they are not – we have simply not been able to express x = y. •\nPartition schemes, identity, and converse. Ligozat and Renz [2004] base their definition of a (binary) qualitative calculus on the notion of a partition scheme, which imposes additional requirements on an abstract partition scheme. In particular, it requires that the set of base relations contains the identity relation and is closed under the converse operation. The analogous definition by Condotta et al. [2006] captures relations of arbitrary arity. Before we define the notion of a partition scheme, we discuss the generalization of identity and converse to the n-ary case.\nThe binary identity relation is given as usual by\nid2 = {(u, u) | u ∈ U}. (1)\nExample 3.8. Clearly, = in S(PC1) and “equals” in S(RCC-5) and S(CYCb) are the identity relation over the respective domain. •\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nThe most inclusive way to generalize (1) to the n-ary case is to fix a setM of numbers of all positions where tuples in idn are required to agree. Thus, an n-ary identity relation is a domain relation idnM with M ⊆ {1, . . . , n} and |M | > 2, which is defined by\nidnM = {(u1, . . . , un) ∈ Un | ui = uj for all i, j ∈M}.\nThis definition subsumes the “diagonal elements” ∆ij of Condotta et al. [2006] for the case |M | = 2. However, it is not enough to restrict attention to |M | = 2 because there are ternary calculi which contain all identities id31,2, id 3 1,3, id 3 2,3, and id 3 1,2,3, an example being the LR calculus, which was described as “the finest of its class” [Scivos and Nebel 2005]. Since the relations in an n-ary abstract partition scheme are JEPD, all identities idnM are either base relations or subsumed by those. The stronger notion of a partition scheme should thus require that all identities be made explicit.\nFor binary relations, id2 from (1) is the unique identity relation id2{1,2}.\nThe standard definition for the converse operation ˘ on binary relations is\nr̆ = {(v, u) | (u, v) ∈ r}. (2)\nExample 3.9. In S(PC1) we have that <˘ is >; =˘ is =; >˘ is <. The converses of the base relations in S(RCC-5) and S(CYCb) were named in Examples 3.2 and 3.3. •\nIn order to generalize the reversal of the pairs (u, v) in (2) to n-ary tuples, we consider arbitrary permutations of n-tuples. An n-ary permutation is a bijection π : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}. We use the notation π : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (i1, . . . , in) as an abbreviation for “π(1) = i1, . . . , π(n) = in”. The identity permutation ι : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (1, . . . , n) is called trivial; all other permutations are nontrivial.\nA finite set P of n-ary permutations is called generating if each n-ary permutation is a composition of permutations from P . For example, the following two permutations form a (minimal) generating set:\nsc : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (2, . . . , n, 1) (shortcut) hm : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (1, . . . , n− 2, n, n− 1) (homing)\nThe names have been introduced in Freksa and Zimmermann [1992] for ternary permutations, together with a name for a third distinguished permutation:\ninv : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (2, 1, 3 . . . , n) (inversion)\nCondotta et al. [2006] call shortcut “rotation” (ry) and homing “permutation” (r#).\nExample 3.10. In Figure 5 we depict the permutations sc (rotation), hm (permutation), and inv for one relation from the ternary Double Cross Calculus (2-cross) [Freksa and Zimmermann 1992]. The 2-cross relations specify the location of a point P3 relative to an oriented line segment given by two points P1, P2. Figure 5 a shows the relation right-front. The relations resulting from applying the permutations are depicted in Figure 5 b; e.g., sc(right-front) = right-back because the latter is P1’s position relative to the line segment −−−→ P2P3. Figure 5 c will be relevant later.\nFor n = 2, sc, hm and inv coincide; indeed, there is a unique minimal generating set, which consists of the single permutation ˘ : (1, 2) 7→ (2, 1). For n > 3, there are several generating sets, e.g., {sc,hm} and {inv,hm}.\nNow an n-ary permutation operation is a map ·π that assigns to each n-ary domain relation r an n-ary domain relation denoted by rπ, where π is an n-ary permutation and the following holds: rπ = {(uπ(1), . . . , uπ(n)) | (u1, . . . , un) ∈ r}\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nWe are now ready to give our definition of a partition scheme, lifting Ligozat and Renz’s binary version to the n-ary case, and generalizing Condotta et al.’s n-ary version to arbitrary generating sets.\nDefinition 3.11. An n-ary partition scheme (U ,R) is an n-ary abstract partition scheme with the following two additional properties.\n(1) R contains all identity relations idnM , M ⊆ {1, . . . , n}, |M | > 2. (2) There is a generating set P of permutations such that, for every r ∈ R and every\nπ ∈ P , there is some s ∈ R with rπ = s.\nIn the special case of binary relations, we have the following.\nOBSERVATION 3.12. A binary partition scheme (U ,R) is a binary abstract partition scheme with the following two additional properties.\n(1) R contains the identity relation id2. (2) For every r ∈ R, there is some s ∈ R such that r̆ = s.\nExample 3.13. It follows that S(PC1), S(RCC-5), and S(CYCb) are even partition schemes. In contrast, the abstract partition scheme (R, {6, >}) is not a partition scheme: it violates both conditions of Observation 3.12 (and thus of Definition 3.11). •\nExample 3.14. As an example of an intuitive and useful abstract partition scheme that is not a partition scheme, consider the calculus Cardinal Direction Relations (CDR) [Skiadopoulos and Koubarakis 2005]. CDR describes the placement of regions in a 2D space (e.g., countries on the globe) relative to each other, and with respect to a fixed coordinate system. The axes of the bounding box of the reference region y divide the space into nine tiles, see Fig. 6 (a). The binary relations in S(CDR) now determine which tiles relative to y are occupied by a primary region x: e.g., in Fig. 6 (b), tiles N, W, and B of y are occupied by x; hence we have x N:W:B y. Simple combinatorics yields 29 − 1 = 511 base relations.\nNow S(CDR) is not a partition scheme because it violates Condition 2 of Observation 3.12 (and thus of Definition 3.11): e.g., the converse of the base relation S (south) is not a base relation. To justify this claim, assume the contrary. Take two specific regions x, y with x S y, namely two unit squares, where y is exactly above x. Then we also have y N x; therefore the converse of S is N. Now stretch the width of x by any factor > 1. Then we still have y N x, but no longer x S y. Hence the converse of S cannot comprise all of N, which contradicts the assumption that the converse of S is a base relation.\nThe related calculus RCD [Navarrete et al. 2013] abstracts away from the concrete shape of regions and replaces them with their bounding boxes, see Fig. 6 (c). S(RCD) is not a partition scheme, with the same argument from above. •\nIt is important to note that violations of Definition 3.11 such as those reported in Example 3.14 are not necessarily bugs in the design of the respective calculi – in fact they\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nare often a feature of the corresponding representation language, which is deliberately designed to be just as fine as necessary, and may thus omit some identity relations or converses/compositions of base relations. To turn, say, CDR into a partition scheme, one would have to break down the 511 base relations into smaller ones, resulting in even more, less cognitively plausible ones. Thus violations of Definition 3.11 are unavoidable, and we adopt the more general notion of an abstract partition scheme.\nCalculi. Intuitively, a qualitative spatial (or temporal) calculus is a symbolic representation of an abstract partition scheme and additionally represents the composition operation on the relations involved. As before, we need to discuss the generalization of binary composition to the n-ary case before we can define it precisely.\nFor binary domain relations, the standard definition of composition is:\nr ◦ s = {(u,w) | ∃v ∈ U : (u, v) ∈ r and (v, w) ∈ s} (3) Example 3.15. In S(PC1) we have, e.g., that < ◦< equals < because a < b and b < c imply a < c. Furthermore, < ◦ > yields the universal relation, i.e., the union of <, =, and >, because “a < b and b > c” is consistent with each of a < c, a = c, and a > c. • We are aware of three ways to generalize (3) to higher arities. The first is a binary operation on the ternary relations of the calculus 2-cross [Freksa 1992b; Freksa and Zimmermann 1992], see also Fig. 5:\nr ◦3FZ s = {(u, v, w) | ∃x : (u, v, x) ∈ r and (v, x, w) ∈ s} It says: if the location of x relative to u and v is determined by r and the location of w relative to v and x is determined by s, then the location of w relative to u and v is determined by r◦3FZs. Fig. 5 c shows the composition of the 2-cross relation right-front with itself; i.e., right-front◦3FZright-front. The red area indicates the possible locations of the point P4; hence the resulting relation is {right-front, right-middle, right-back}. A generalization to other calculi and arities n > 3 is obvious.\nA second alternative results in n(n − 1) binary operations i◦nj [Isli and Cohn 2000; Scivos and Nebel 2005]: the composition of r and s consists of those n-tuples that belong to r (respectively, s) if the i-th (respectively, j-th) component is replaced by some uniform element v.\nr i◦nj s = {(u1, . . . , un) | ∃v : (u1, . . . , ui−1, v, ui+1, . . . , un) ∈ r and (u1, . . . , uj−1, v, uj+1, . . . , un) ∈ s }\nIn the ternary case, this yields, for example:\nr 3◦32 s = {(u, v, w) | ∃x : (u, v, x) ∈ r and (u, x, w) ∈ s} (4) If we assume, for example, that the underlying partition scheme speaks about the relative position of points, we can consider (4) to say: if the position of x relative to u and v is determined by the relation r (as given by (u, v, x) ∈ r) and the position of w\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nrelative to u and x is determined by the relation s (as given by (u, x, w) ∈ s), then the position of w relative to u and v can be inferred to be determined by r 3◦32 s.\nThe third is perhaps the most general, resulting in an n-ary operation [Condotta et al. 2006]: ◦(r1, . . . , rn) consists of those n-tuples which, for every i = 1, . . . , n, belong to the relation ri whenever their i-th component is replaced by some uniform v.\n◦(r1, . . . , rn) = {(u1, . . . , un) | ∃v ∈ U : (u1, . . . , un−1, v) ∈ r1 and (u1, . . . , un−2, v, un) ∈ r2 and . . . and (v, u2, . . . , un) ∈ rn} (5)\nAs an example, consider again n = 3 and 2-cross. Equation (5) says that the composition result of the relations right-front, right-front, and left-back is the set of all triples (u1, u2, u3) such that there is an element v with (u1, u2, v) ∈ right-front, (u1, v, u3) ∈ right-front, and (v, u2, u3) ∈ right-back. That set is exactly the relation right-front, which can be seen drawing pictures similar to Fig. 5.\nFor binary domain relations, all these alternative approaches collapse to (3). In the light of the diverse views on composition, we define a composition operation on n-ary domain relations to be an operation of arity 2 6 m 6 n on n-ary domain relations, without imposing additional requirements. Those are not necessary for the following definitions, which are independent of the particular choice of composition.\nWe now define our minimal notion of a spatial calculus, which provides a set of symbols for the relations in an abstract partition scheme (Rel), and for some choice of nontrivial permutation operations (̆ 1, . . . ,˘k) and some composition operation ( ).\nDefinition 3.16. An n-ary qualitative calculus is a tuple (Rel, Int,˘1, . . . ,˘k, ) with k > 1 and the following properties. — Rel is a finite, non-empty set of n-ary relation symbols (denoted r, s, t, . . . ). The sub-\nsets of Rel, including singletons, are called composite relations (denoted R,S, T, . . . ). — Int = (U , ϕ, ·π1 , . . . , ·πk , ◦) is an interpretation with the following properties.\n— U is a universe. — ϕ : Rel → 2Un is an injective map assigning an n-ary relation over U to each re-\nlation symbol, such that (U , {ϕ(r) | r ∈ Rel}) is an abstract partition scheme. The map ϕ is extended to composite relations R ⊆ Rel by setting ϕ(R) = ⋃ r∈R ϕ(r).\n— {·π1 , . . . , ·πk} is a set of n-ary nontrivial permutation operations. — ◦ is a composition operation on n-ary domain relations that has arity 2 6 m 6 n.\n— Every permutation operation ˘i is a map ˘i : Rel→ 2Rel that satisfies\nϕ(r̆ i) ⊇ ϕ(r)πi (6)\nfor every r ∈ Rel. The operation ˘i is extended to composite relations R ⊆ Rel by setting R˘i = ⋃ r∈R r̆\ni. — The composition operation is a map : Relm → 2Rel that satisfies\nϕ( (r1, . . . , rm)) ⊇ ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm)) (7) for all r1, . . . , rm ∈ Rel. The operation is extended to composite relations R1, . . . , Rm ⊆ Rel by setting (R1, . . . , Rm) = ⋃ r1∈R1 · · · ⋃ rm∈Rm (r1, . . . , rm).\nIn the special case of binary relations, the natural converse is the only non-trivial permutation operation. Hence k = 1 and we have the following.\nOBSERVATION 3.17. A binary qualitative calculus is a tuple (Rel, Int, ,̆ ) with the following properties.\n— Rel is as in Definition 3.16.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\n— Int = (U , ϕ, π, ◦) is an interpretation with the following properties. — U is a universe. — ϕ : Rel→ 2U×U is an injective map as in Definition 3.16. — π is the standard converse operation on binary domain relations from (2). — ◦ is the standard composition operation on binary domain relations from (3). — The converse operation ˘ is a map ˘ : Rel→ 2Rel that satisfies ∀r ∈ Rel : ϕ(r̆ ) ⊇ ϕ(r)π .\n— The composition operation is a map : Rel× Rel→ 2Rel that satisfies ∀r, s ∈ Rel : ϕ( (r, s)) ⊇ ◦(ϕ(r), ϕ(s)) .\nDue to the last sentence of Definition 3.16, the composition operation of a calculus is uniquely determined by the composition of each pair of relation symbols. This information is usually stored in an m-dimensional table, the composition table.\nExample 3.18. We can now observe that PC1 is indeed a binary calculus with the following components.\n— The set of relation symbols is Rel = {<, =, >}, denoting the relations depicted in Figure 4 a. The 23 = 8 composite relations include, for example, R1 = {<, =} and R2 = {<, =, >}. — There are several possible interpretations, depending largely on the chosen universe. One of the most natural choices leads to the interpretation Int = {U , ϕ, π, ◦} with the following components. — The universe U is the set of reals. — The map ϕ maps <, =, and > to <, =, and >, respectively; see Figure 4 a. Its\nextension to composite relations maps, for example, R1 from above to > and R2 to the universal relation. — The operations π and ◦ are the standard binary converse and composition operations from (2) and (3). — The converse operation ˘ is given by Table I a. For its extension to composite relations, we have, e.g., R1̆ = {>, =} and R2̆ = R2.\n— The composition operation is given by a 3×3 table where each cell represents r s, see Table I b. For its extension to composite relations, we have, for example:\nR1 R2 = {<, =} {<, =, >} = {<} {<} ∪ {<} {=} ∪ . . . ∪ {=} {>} = {<} ∪ {<} ∪ · · · ∪ {>} = R2\n•\nExample 3.19. RCC-5 too is a binary calculus, with the following components.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\n— The set of relation symbols is Rel = {EQ, DC, PO, PP, PPi}, denoting the relations depicted in Figure 4 b. The 25 = 32 composite relations include, for example, R1 = {DC, PO, PP, PPi} (“both regions are distinct”) and R2 = {PP, PPi} (“one region is a proper part of the other”). — Similarly to PC1, there are several possible interpretations, a natural choice being Int = {U , ϕ, π, ◦} with the following components. — The universe U is the set of all regular closed subsets of R2. — The map ϕ maps, for example, DC to all pairs of regions that are disconnected\nor externally connected. Figure 4 b illustrates ϕ(r) for all relation symbols r = EQ, DC, PO, PP, PPi. — The operations π and ◦ are the standard binary converse and composition operations from (2) and (3).\n— The converse operation ˘ is given by Table II a. we have, e.g., R2̆ = R2.\n— The composition operation is given by a 5×5 table where each cell represents r s, see Table II b. For its extension to composite relations, we have, for example:\n{PP, PPi} {DC} = {PP} {DC} ∪ {PPi} {DC} = {DC} ∪ {DC, PO, PPi} = {DC, PO, PPi}\n•\nExample 3.20. CYCb too is a binary calculus, with the following components.\n— The set of relation symbols is Rel = {e, o, l, r}, denoting the relations depicted in Figure 4 c. The 24 = 16 composite relations include, for example, R1 = {e, l} (“the orientation y is to the left of, or equal to, x”) and R2 = {e, o} (“both orientations are equal or opposite to each other”). — The standard interpretation for CYCb is Int = {U , ϕ, π, ◦} with the following components. — The universe U is the set of all 2D-orientations, which can equivalently be viewed\nas either the set of radii of a given fixed circle C, or the set of points on the periphery of C, or the set of directed lines through a given fixed point (the origin of C).\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\n— The map ϕmaps, for example, l to all pairs (x, y) of directed lines where the angle α from x to y, in counterclockwise fashion, satisfies 0◦ < α < 180◦. Analogously o is mapped to those pairs where that angle is exactly 180◦. Figure 4 c illustrates ϕ(r) for all relation symbols r = e, o, l, r. — The operations π and ◦ are the standard binary converse and composition operations from (2) and (3). — The converse operation ˘ is given by Table III a. For its extension to composite relations, we have, e.g., R1̆ = {e, l}.\n— The composition operation is given by a 4×4 table where each cell represents r s, see Table III b. For its extension to composite relations, we have, for example:\nR1 R1 = {e, l} {e, l} = {e} {e} ∪ {e} {l} ∪ {l} {e} ∪ {l} {l} = {e} ∪ {l} ∪ {l} ∪ {e, l, r} = {e, l, r}\n•\nAbstract versus weak and strong operations. We call permutation and composition operations with Properties (6) and (7) abstract permutation and abstract composition, following Ligozat’s naming in the binary case [Ligozat 2005]. For reasons explained further below, our notion of a qualitative calculus imposes weaker requirements on the permutation operation than Ligozat and Renz’s notions of a weak (binary) representation [Ligozat 2005; Ligozat and Renz 2004] or the notion of a (binary) constraint algebra [Nebel and Scivos 2002]. The following definition specifies those stronger variants, see, e.g., Ligozat and Renz [2004].\nDefinition 3.21. Let (Rel, Int,˘1, . . . ,˘k, ) be a qualitative calculus based on the interpretation Int = (U , ϕ, ·π1 , . . . , ·πk , ◦). The permutation operation ˘i is a weak permutation if, for all r ∈ Rel:\nr̆ i = ⋂ {S ⊆ Rel | ϕ(S) ⊇ ϕ(r)πi} (8)\nThe permutation operation ˘i is a strong permutation if, for all r ∈ Rel: ϕ(r̆ i) = ϕ(r)πi (9)\nThe composition operation is a weak composition if, for all r1, . . . , rm ∈ Rel: (r1, . . . , rm) = ⋂ {S ⊆ Rel | ϕ(S) ⊇ ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm))} (10)\nThe composition is a strong composition if, for all r1, . . . , rm ∈ Rel: ϕ( (r1, . . . , rm)) = ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm)) (11)\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nIn the literature, the equivalent variant r̆ i = {s ∈ Rel | ϕ(s) ∩ ϕ(r)πi 6= ∅} of Equation (8) is sometimes found; analogously for Equation (10).\nExample 3.22. The converse and permutation operation in PC1 are both strong because (9) holds for all three relation symbols (e.g., ϕ(<̆ ) = ϕ(>) = > = <˘ = ϕ(<)̆ ), and the binary version of (11), namely\nϕ(r1 r2) = ϕ(r1) ◦ ϕ(r2), holds for all nine pairs of relation symbols (e.g., ϕ(> >) = ϕ(>) = > = > ◦ > = ϕ(>) ◦ ϕ(>)). •\nExample 3.23. Consider the variant PCN1 of PC1 that is interpreted over the universe N. It contains the same base relations with the usual interpretation and, obviously, the same converse operation, see Example 3.18. However, composition is no longer strong because < ◦ < ( < holds: for “⊆” observe that, whenever x < y < z for three points x, y, z ∈ N, it follows that x < z; and “+” holds because there are points x, z with x < z for which there is no y with x < y < z, for example, x = 0, z = 1. More precisely, the result of the composition < < should be the relation <1= {(x, z) | x+ 1 < z}. Since <1 is not expressible by a union of base relations, we cannot endow this calculus with a strong symbolic composition operation. Consequently we have a choice as to the composition result in question. Regardless of that choice, the composition table will incur a loss of information because it cannot capture that the pair (x, z) is in <1.\nIf we opt for weak composition, then Equation (10) requires us to generate the result of < < from the symbols for exactly those relations that overlap with the domain-level composition < ◦<. From the above it is clear that this is exactly <. One can now easily check that, for the case of weak composition, we get precisely Table II b.\nOn the contrary, if we do not care about composition being weak, then abstract composition (Inequality (7)) requires us to generate the result of < < from the symbols for at least those relations that overlap with < ◦ <. This means that we can postulate < < = {<} as before or, for example, < < = {<, =, >}.\nThe difference between weak and abstract composition is that abstract composition allows us to make the composition result arbitrarily general, whereas weak composition forces us to take exactly those relations into account that contain possible pairs of (x, z). Weak composition therefore restricts the loss of information to an unavoidable minimum, whereas abstract composition does not provide such a guarantee: the more base relations are included in the composition result, the more information we lose on how x and z are interrelated.\nIn this connection, it becomes clear why we require composition to be at least abstract: without this requirement, we could omit, for example, < from the above composition result. This would result in adding spurious information because we would suddenly be able to conclude that the constellation x < y < z is impossible, just because < < = ∅. This insight, in turn, is particularly important for ensuring soundness of the most common reasoning algorithm, a-closure, see Section 3.2. • In terms of composition tables, abstract composition requires that each cell corresponding to (r1, . . . , rm) contains at least those relation symbols t whose interpretation intersects with ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm)). Weak composition additionally requires that each cell contains exactly those t. Strong composition, in contrast, implies a requirement to the underlying partition scheme: whenever ϕ(t) intersects with ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm)), it has to be contained in ◦(ϕ(r1), . . . , ϕ(rm)). Analogously for permutation.\nThese explanations and those in Example 3.23 show that abstractness as in Properties (6) and (7) captures minimal requirements to the operations in a qualitative calculus: it ensures that, whenever the symbolic relations cannot capture the converse\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nor composition of some domain relations exactly, the symbolic converse (composition) approximates its domain-level counterpart from above, thus avoiding the introduction of spurious information. Weakness (Properties (8) and (10)) additionally ensures that the loss of information is kept to the unavoidable minimum. This last observation is presumably the reason why existing calculi (see Section 3.4) typically have at least weak operations – we are not aware of any calculus with only abstract operations.\nIn Section 3.2, we will see that abstract composition is a minimal requirement for ensuring soundness of the most common reasoning algorithm, a-closure, and review the impact of the various strengths of the operations on reasoning algorithms.\nThe three notions form a hierarchy:\nFACT 3.24. Every strong permutation (composition) is weak, and every weak permutation (composition) is abstract. A.1\nIt suffices to postulate the properties weakness and strongness with respect to relation symbols only: they carry over to composite relations as shown in Fact 3.25.\nFACT 3.25. Given a qualitative calculus (Rel, Int,˘1, . . . ,˘k, ) the following holds. For all composite relations R ⊆ Rel and i = 1, . . . , k:\nϕ(R˘i) ⊇ ϕ(R)πi (12) For all composite relations R1, . . . , Rm ⊆ Rel:\nϕ( (R1, . . . , Rm)) ⊇ ◦(ϕ(R1), . . . , ϕ(Rm)) (13)\nIf ˘i is a weak permutation, then, for all R ⊆ Rel: R˘i = ⋂ {S ⊆ Rel | ϕ(S) ⊇ ϕ(R)πi}\nIf ˘i is a strong permutation, then, for all R ⊆ Rel:\nϕ(R˘i) = ϕ(R)πi\nIf is a weak composition, then, for all R1, . . . , Rm ⊆ Rel: (R1, . . . , Rm) = ⋂ {S ⊆ Rel | ϕ(S) ⊇ ◦(ϕ(R1), . . . , ϕ(Rm)}\nIf is a strong composition, then, for all R1, . . . , Rm ⊆ Rel: ϕ( (R1, . . . , Rm)) = ◦(ϕ(R1), . . . , ϕ(Rm)) A.2\nSuppose that we want to achieve that the symbolic permutation operations provided by a calculus C capture all permutations at the domain level. Then C needs to be permutation-complete in the sense that at least weak permutation operations for all n!− 1 nontrivial permutations can be derived uniquely by composing the ones defined.\nIn the binary case, where the converse is the unique nontrivial (and generating) permutation, every calculus is permutation-complete. However, as noted above, the converse is not strong for the binary CDR and RCD calculi (cf. Definition 3.11 ff.). There are also ternary calculi whose permutations are not strong: e.g., the shortcut, homing, and inversion operations in the single-cross and double-cross calculi [Freksa 1992b; Freksa and Zimmermann 1992] are only weak. Since these calculi provide no further permutation operations, they are not permutation-complete. However, it is easy to compute the two missing permutations and thus make both calculi permutation-complete.\nLigozat and Renz’ [2004] basic notion of a binary qualitative calculus is based on a weak representation which requires an identity relation, abstract composition, and the converse being strong, thus excluding, for example, CDR and RCD. A representation\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nis a weak representation with a strong composition and an injective map ϕ. Our basic notion of a qualitative calculus is more general than a weak representation by not requiring an identity relation, and by only requiring abstract permutations and composition, thus including CDR and RCD. On the other hand, it is slightly more restrictive by requiring the map ϕ to be injective – however, since base relations are JEPD, the only way for ϕ to violate injectivity is to give multiple names to the same relation, which is not really intuitive. It is even problematic because it leads to unintended behavior of the notion of weak composition (or permutation): if there are two relation symbols for every domain relation, then the intersections in Equations (8) and (10) will range over disjoint composite relations S and thus become empty.\nRecently, Westphal et al. [2014] gave a new definition of a qualitative calculus that does not explicitly use a map – in our case the interpretation Int – that connects the symbols with their semantics. Instead, they employ the “notion of consistency” [Westphal et al. 2014, p. 211] for generating a weak algebra from the Boolean algebra of relation symbols. As with [Ligozat and Renz 2004] their definition of a qualitative calculus is confined to binary relations only."

      "text" : "As in the area of classical constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), we are given a set of variables and constraints: a constraint network or a qualitative CSP.1 The task of constraint satisfaction is to decide whether there exists a valuation of all variables that satisfies the constraints. In calculi for spatial and temporal reasoning, all variables range over the entities of the specific spatial (or temporal) domain of a qualitative calculus. The relation symbols defined by the calculus serve to express constraints between the entities. More formally, we have:\nDefinition 3.26 (QCSP). Let C = (Rel, Int,˘1, . . . ,˘k, ) be an n-ary qualitative calculus with Int = (U , ϕ, ·π1 , . . . , ·πk , ◦), and let X be a set of variables ranging over U . An nary qualitative constraint in C is a formula R(x1, . . . , xn) with variables x1, . . . , xn ∈ X and a relation R ⊆ Rel. We say that a valuation ψ : X → U satisfies R(x1, . . . , xn) if (ψ(x1), . . . , ψ(xn)) ∈ ϕ(R) holds.\nA qualitative constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) is the task to decide whether there is a valuation ψ for a set of variables satisfying a set of constraints.\nExample 3.27. In PC1 we may have the two constraints c1 = x1 < x2 and c2 = x2 {<, =} x3. The valuation ψ : X → R with ψ(x1) = √ 2, ψ(x2) = 3.14 and ψ(x3) = 42 satisfies both constraints. If we set ψ(x3) = 3.14, then both constraints remain satisfied by ψ; if we set ψ(x3) = 2.718, then ψ no longer satisfies c2. •\nFor simplicity and without loss of generality, we assume that every set of constraints contains exactly one constraint per set of n variables. Thus, of binary constraints either rx1,x2 or r′x2,x1 is assumed to be given – the other can be derived using converse; multiple constraints regarding variables x1, x2 can be integrated via intersection. In the following, rx1,...,xn stands for the unique constraint between the variables x1, . . . , xn.\nSeveral techniques originally developed for finite-domain CSPs can be adapted to spatial and temporal QCSPs. Since deciding CSP instances is already NP-complete for search problems with finite domains, heuristics are important. One particularly valuable technique is constraint propagation which aims at making implicit constraints explicit in order to identify variable assignments that would violate some constraint. By pruning away these variable assignments, a consistent valuation can be searched\n1In the CSP domain, “CSP” usually refers to a single instance, not the decision or computation problem.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nmore efficiently. A common approach is to enforce k-consistency; the following definition is standard in the CSP literature [Dechter 2003].\nDefinition 3.28. A QCSP with variablesX is k-consistent if, for all subsetsX ′ ( X of size k−1, we can extend any valuation ofX ′ that satisfies the constraints to a valuation of X ′ ∪ {z} also satisfying the constraints, for any additional variable z ∈ X \\X ′.\nQCSPs are naturally 1-consistent as universes are nonempty and there are no unary constraints. An n-ary QCSP is n-consistent if r̆ ix1,...,xk = rπi(x1,...,xk) for all i and rx1,...,xk 6= ∅: domain relations are typically serial, that is, for any r and x1, . . . , xk−1, there is some xk with r(x1, . . . , xk). In the case of binary relations, this means that 2- consistency is guaranteed in calculi with a strong converse by r̆x,y = ry,x and rx,y 6= ∅, and seriality of r means that, for every x, there is a y with r(x, y).\nAlready examining (n+1)-consistency may provide very useful information. The following is best explained for binary relations and then generalized to higher arities. A 3-consistent binary QCSP is called path-consistent, and Definition 3.28 can be rewritten using binary composition as\n∀x, y ∈ X rx,y ⊆ ⋂ z∈X rx,z ◦ rz,y. (14)\nWe can enforce 3-consistency by computing the fixpoint of the refinement operation\nrx,y ← rx,y ∩ (rx,z ◦ rz,y) , (15) applied to all variables x, y, z ∈ X. In finite CSPs with variables ranging over finite domains, composition is also finite and the procedure always terminates since the refinement operation is monotone and there can thus only be finitely many steps until reaching the fixpoint. Such procedures are called path-consistency algorithms and require O(|X|3) time [Dechter 2003].\nExample 3.29. The QCSP in Figure 3(c) based on PC1 is not path-consistent because rA,C implicitly takes on the universal relation, and thus Equation (14) is violated for x = A, y = C, z = B. By contrast, the QCSP in Figure 3(b) is path-consistent, which can be verified by considering each permutation of A,B,C in turn. • Enforcing path-consistency with QCSPs may not be possible using a symbolic algorithm since Equation (15) may lead to relations not expressible in 2Rel. This problem occurs when composition in a qualitative calculus is not strong. It is however straightforward to weaken Equation (15) using weak composition:\nrx,y ← rx,y ∩ (rx,z rz,y) (16) The resulting procedure is called enforcing algebraic closure or a-closure for short. The QCSP obtained as a fixpoint of the iteration is called algebraically closed.\nExample 3.30. Consider the PC1 QCSP in Figure 3(c). The missing edge between variables A and C indicates an implicit constraint via the universal relation u = {<, =, >}. Enforcing a-closure as per (16) updates this constraint with u ∪ < <, which yields <, resulting in Figure 3(b). Further applications of (16) do not cause any more changes; hence the QCSP in Figure 3(b) is algebraically closed. • If composition in a qualitative calculus is strong, a-closure and path-consistency coincide. Since there are finitely many relations in a qualitative calculus, a-closure shares all computational properties with the finite CSP case.\nA natural generalization from binary to n-ary relations can be achieved by considering (n + 1)-consistency (recall that path-consistency is 3-consistency). In context of\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nsymbolic computation with qualitative calculi we thus need to lift Equations (14) and (15) to the particular composition operation available. For composition as defined by (5) one obtains\n∀x1, . . . , xn ∈ X rx1,...,xn ⊆ ⋂ y∈X ◦(rx1,...,xn−1,y, rx1,...,xn−2,y,xn , . . . , ry,x2,...,xn),\nand the symbolic refinement operation (16) becomes\nrx1,...,xn ← rx1,...,xn ∩ (rx1,...,xn−1,y, rx1,...,xn−2,y,xn , . . . , ry,x2,...,xn). (17)\nThe reason why, in Definition 3.16, we require composition to be at least abstract is that Inclusion (7) guarantees that reasoning via a-closure is sound: enforcing kconsistency or a-closure does not change the solutions of a CSP, as only impossible valuations are locally removed. If application of a-closure results in the empty relation, then the QCSP is known to be inconsistent. By contrast, an algebraically closed QCSP may not be consistent though. However, for several qualitative calculi (or at least subalgebras thereof) a-closure and consistency coincide, see also Section 3.4.\nExample 3.31. Consider the modification PC′′′1 based on the binary abstract partition scheme S(PC′′′1 ) = ({0, 1, 2}, {<,=, >}), i.e., the domain now has 3 elements. Then the QCSP containing 4 nodes and the constraints {x0 < x1, x1 < x2, x2 < x3} has the algebraic closure {xi < xj | 0 6 i < j 6 3}, which has no solution in the 3-element domain. •\nSince domain relations are JEPD, deciding QCSPs with arbitrary composite relations can be reduced to deciding QCSPs with only atomic relations (i.e., relation symbols) by means of search (cf. [Renz and Nebel 2007]). The approach to reason in a full algebra is thus to refine a composite relation R ∪ S to either R or S in a backtracking search fashion, until a dedicated decision procedure becomes applicable. Computationally, reasoning with the complete algebra is typically NP-hard due to the exponential number of possible refinements to atomic relations. For investigating reasoning algorithms, one is thus interested in the complexity of reasoning with atomic relations. If they can be handled in polynomial time, maximal tractable sub-algebras that extend the set of atomic relations are of interest too. Efficient reasoning algorithms for atomic relations and the existence of large tractable sub-algebras suggest efficiency in handling practical problems. The search for maximal tractable sub-algebras can be significantly eased by applying the automated methods proposed by Renz [2007]. These exploit algebraic operations to derive tractable composite relations and, complementary, search for embeddings of NP-hard problems. Using a-closure plus refinement search has been regarded as the prevailing reasoning method. Certainly, a-closure provides an efficient cubic time method for constraint propagation, but Table VII clearly shows that the majority of calculi require further methods as decision procedures."

      "text" : "In the following, we present an overview of existing calculi obtained from a systematic literature survey, covering publications in the relevant conferences and journals in the past 25 years, and following their citation graphs. To be included in our overview, a qualitative calculus has to be based on a spatial and/or temporal domain, fall under our general definition of a qualitative calculus (Def. 3.16: provide symbolic relations, the required symbolic operations, and semantics based on an abstract partition scheme), and be described in the literature either with explicit composition/converse tables, or with instructions for computing those. These selection critera exclude sets of qualitative relations that have been axiomatized in the context of logical theories, see Section 5.2, or qualitative calculi designed for other domains, such as ontology alignment [Inants and Euzenat 2015]).\nTables IV–VI list, to the best of our knowledge, all calculi satisfying these criteria. Table IV lists the names of families of calculi and their domains. Tables V and VI list all variants of these families with original references, arity and number of their base relations (which is an indicator for the level of granularity offered and for the average branching factor to expect in standard reasoning procedures). Additionally we indicate which calculi are implemented in SparQ and can be obtained from there.\nRepresentational aspects of calculi are shown in Figures 7 and 8, grouping calculi by the type of their basic entities and the key aspects captured. For all temporal and selected spatial calculi we iconographically show one exemplary base relation to illustrate the kind of statements it permits. For a complete understanding of the respective calculus, the interested reader is referred to the original research papers cited in Tables V and VI. We sometimes use a more descriptive relation name than the original work.\nFigure 9 shows the known relations between the expressivity of existing calculi. There are several ways to measure these, via the existence of faithful translations not only between base relations over the same domain, but also between representations of related domains or between representations concerned with a different domain. For example, the dependency calculus DepCalc representing dependency between points is isomorphic to RCC-5 representing topology of regions. Both calculi feature the same algebraic structure representing partial-order relationships in the domain.\nSince expressivity of qualitative representations solely relies on how relations are defined, there exist distinct calculi which exhibit the same expressivity when Boolean combinations of constraints are considered. These connections are particularly interesting, not only from the perspective of selecting an appropriate representation, but also in view of computational properties. For example, deciding consistency of atomic constraint networks over the point calculus PC is polynomial. Using Boolean combinations of PC relations one can simulate Allen interval relations. Nebel and Bürckert [1995] have exploited this relationship to lift a tractable subset to Allen. In Figure 9 we indicate by an arrow A → B that relations in A can be expressed by Boolean combinations of relations in B. For clarity we only show direct relations, not their transitive closure.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nComputational aspects of calculi are shown in Table VII, as far as they have already been identified. Some fairly straightforward supplements have been made while compiling this table; their proofs are in Appendix C. According to the discussion in the previous section, we give the computational complexity for deciding consistency with atomic QCSPs and the best known complete decision procedure, which is different from a-closure in those cases where a-closure is incomplete. We only indicate the type of algorithm applicable (e.g., linear programming), but not its most efficient realization. We furthermore list tractable subalgebras that cover at least all atomic relations – these subalgebras allow for reasoning in the full algebra via combining the named decision procedure with a search for a refinement. The complexity is given as “P” (in polynomial time), “NPc” (NP-complete), and “NPh” (NP-hard, NP-membership unknown)."

The loss of information associated with this mapping is mostly intended. To understand the other, we recall that a spatial (or temporal) calculus consists of symbolic relations and\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\noperations, representing the domain relations and operations. While the domain operations are known to satisfy strong algebraic properties, those do not necessarily carry over to the symbolic operations – for example, if the operation ·hm representing homing (Section 3.1) is only abstract or weak, then there will be symbolic relations r with (rhm)hm 6= r although, at the domain level, (Rhm)hm = R holds for any n-ary relation R, including the interpretation ϕ(r) of r. This loss of information indicates an unintended structural misalignment between the domain level and the symbolic level. Having its roots in the abstraction step, where the set of domain relations and operations is determined, the information loss becomes noticeable only with the symbolic representation.\nIf we want to measure how well the symbolic operations in a calculus preserve information, we can compare their algebraic properties with those of their domain-level counterparts. If they share all algebraic properties, this indicates that they maximally preserve information. In addition, algebraic properties seem to supply a finer-grained measure than the mere distinction between abstract, weak, and strong operations: there are 14 axioms for binary relation algebras and variants, each containing two inclusions or implications that may or may not hold independently.\nSeveral algebraic properties can be exploited to justify and implement optimizations in constraint reasoners. For example, associativity of the composition operation for binary symbolic relations ensures that, if the reasoner encounters a path ArBsCtD of length 3, then the relationship between A and D can be computed “from left to right”. Without associativity, it may be necessary to compute (r s) t as well as r (s t).\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nIn order to study the algebraic properties of spatial and temporal calculi, the classical notion of a relation algebra (RA) [Maddux 2006] plays a central role [Isli and Cohn 2000; Ligozat and Renz 2004; Düntsch 2005; Mossakowski 2007]. The axioms in the definition of an RA reflect the algebraic properties of the relevant operations on binary domain relations – the operations are union, intersection, complement, converse, and binary compositions; the properties are commutativity, several variants of associativity and distributivity, and others. These properties have been postulated for binary calculi [Ligozat and Renz 2004; Düntsch 2005], but it has been shown that not all existing calculi satisfy these strong properties [Mossakowski 2007]. It is the main aim of this subsection to study the algebraic properties of existing binary calculi and derive from the results a taxonomy of calculus algebras.\nUnfortunately, it is far from straightforward to extend this study to arity 3 or higher: while algebraic properties of ternary and n-ary calculi have been studied [Isli and Cohn 2000; Scivos and Nebel 2005; Condotta et al. 2006], we are aware of only one axiomatization for a ternary RA [Isli and Cohn 2000], based on one particular choice of permutation (homing and shortcut) and composition (the binary variant (4)). However, existing calculi are based on different choices of these operations, and each choice comes with different algebraic properties at the domain level, for example:\n— Not all permutations are involutive: e.g., in the ternary case, we do not have (Rsc)sc = R for all domain relations R, but rather ((Rsc)sc)sc = R. — Each variant of the composition operation has its own neutral element, that is, a relation E such that R ◦ E = E ◦ R = R for all relations R: e.g., in the ternary case, 3◦32 (Section 3.1) has id 3 {2,3} as the neutral element while ◦3FZ has id 3 {1,2}. — Some variants of the composition operation have stronger properties than others: e.g., 3◦32 is associative while ◦3FZ is not.\nEstablishing a unifying algebraic framework for n-ary spatial and temporal calculi and determining the algebraic properties of existing calculi would require a whole new research program. In this survey article, we will therefore restrict our attention to the binary case for the remainder of this section.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY."

In the literature, a different axiomatization is sometimes used, for example in [Ligozat and Renz 2004]. The most prominent difference is that R10 is replaced by PL, “a more intuitive and useful form, known as the Peircean law or De Morgan’s Theorem K” [Hirsch and Hodkinson 2002]. It is shown in [Hirsch and Hodkinson 2002, Section 3.3.2] that, given R1–R3, R5, R7–R9, the axioms R10 and PL are equivalent. The implication PL ⇒ R10 does not need R5 and R8.\nAll axioms except PL can be weakened to only one of two inclusions, which we denote by a superscript ⊇ or ⊆. For example, R⊇7 denotes (r̆ )̆ ⊇ r.

Due to Fact 4.2, we only need to consider axioms R4, R6, R7, R9, R10 (or PL) and their weakenings R6l, S, W.\nR4 (and S, W). Axiom R4 is helpful for modeling since it allows parentheses in chains of compositions to be omitted. For example, consider the following statement in natural language about the relative length and location of two intervals A and D. Interval A is before some equally long interval that is contained in some longer interval that meets the shorter interval D. This statement is just a conjunction of relations between A, the unnamed intermediary intervals B,C, and D. Although it intuitively does not matter whether we give priority to the composition of the relations betweenA,B andB,C or to the composition of the relations between B,C and C,D, there are calculi such as INDU which do not satisfy Axiom R4 – then the example statement needs to be interpreted as a Boolean formula consisting of a conjunction over both alternatives.\nWe note that violation of R4 is independent of composition not being strong, as shown in Section 4.4. Presence of strong composition however implies R4 since composition of binary domain relations over U is associative:\nFACT 4.3. Every qualitative calculus where composition is strong satisfies R4.\nFurthermore, already a weakening R⊇4 or R ⊆ 4 is useful for optimizing reasoning algorithms, allowing the “finer” composition – say, r (s t) in case of R⊆4 – to be computed when a chain of compositions needs to be evaluated.\nR6 and R6l. Presence of an id relation allows the standard reduction from the correspondence problem to satisfiability: to test whether a constraint system admits the equality of two variables x, y, one can add an id-constraint between x, y and test the extended system for satisfiability.\nR7 and R9. These axioms allow for certain optimizations in symbolic reasoning, in particular algebraic closure. If a relation r satisfies R7, then reasoning systems do not need to store both constraints ArB and B r′A, since r′ can be reconstructed as r̆ if needed. Similarly, R9 grants that, when enforcing algebraic closure by using Equation (16) to refine constraints between variable A and B, it is sufficient to compute composition once and, after applying the converse, reuse it to refine the constraint between B and A too. Current reasoning algorithms and their implementations use the described optimizations; they produce incorrect results for calculi violating R7 or R9.\nR10 and PL. These axioms reflect that the relation symbols of a calculus indeed represent binary domain relations, i.e., pairs of elements of a universe. This can be explained from two different points of view.\n(1) If binary domain relations are considered as sets, R10 is equivalent to r̆ r s ⊆ s̄. If we further assume the usual set-theoretic interpretation of the composition of two domain relations, the above inclusion reads as: For any X,Y , if Z rX for some Z and, Z r U implies not U sY for any U , then not X sY . This is certainly true because X is one such U . (2) Under the same assumptions, each side of PL says (in a different order) that there can be no triangle X r Y, Y sZ,Z tX. The equality then means that the “reading direction” does not matter, see also [Düntsch 2005]. This allows for reducing nondeterminism in the a-closure procedure, as well as for efficient refinement and enumeration of consistent scenarios.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY."

These have been used with Hets to determine congruence of calculus and axioms. Additionally, SparQ and its built-in analysis tools have been employed to double-check results. Due to Fact 4.2, it suffices to test Axioms R4, R6, R7, R9, R10 (or PL) and, if necessary, the weakenings S, W, and R6l.\nThe results of our tests are depicted in Figure 10, further details are provided in Appendix E. The figure arranges the analyzed calculi as hierarchy, the strongest notion (relation algebra) residing at the top and the weakest (weakly associative Boolean algebra) at the bottom. Arrows represent the is-a relation; i.e., every relation algebra is an “RA minus id law” as well as a semi-associative relation algebra and, via transitivity, a weakly associative Boolean algebra.\nWith the exceptions of RCD, cCDR and all QTC variants, all tested calculi are at least semi-associative relation algebras; most of them are even relation algebras. Hence, only these calculi enjoy all advantages for representation and reasoning optimizations discussed in Section 4.2. For other groups of calculi, special care in implementations of reasoning procedures need to be taken. In Section 4.5 we present a revised algorithm to compute algebraic closure that respects all eventualities.\nThe three groups of calculi that are SAs but not RAs are the Dipole Calculus variant DRAf (refined DRAfp and coarsened DRA-conn are even RAs!), as well as INDU and\n3For the parametrized calculi DRA, OPRA, QTC, we count every variant separately.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nOPRAm for at least m = 1, . . . , 8. These calculi do not even satisfy one of the inclusions R⊇4 and R ⊆ 4 , which implies that the reasoning optimizations described in Section 4.2 for Axiom R4 cannot be applied. As a side note, our observations suggest that the meaning of the letter combination “RA” in the abbreviations “DRA” and “OPRA” should stand for “Reasoning Algebra”, not for “Relation Algebra”.\nIn principle, it cannot be completely ruled out that associativity is reported to be violated due to errors in either the operation tables published or the experimental setup. This even applies to non-violations, although it is much more likely that errors cause sporadic violations than systematic non-violations. In the case of DRAf , INDU and OPRAm, m = 1, . . . , 8, the relatively high percentage of violations make implementation errors seem unlikely to be the cause. However, to obtain certainty that these calculi indeed violate R4, one has to find concrete counterexamples and verify them using the original definition of the respective calculus. For DRAf and INDU, this has been done in the literature [Moratz et al. 2011; Balbiani et al. 2006]. Interestingly, the violation of associativity has been attributed to the converse or composition not being strong. We remark, however, that composition cannot be the culprit because, for example, DRAfp has an associative, but only weak, composition operation. While DRAfp has been proven to be associative due to strong composition in [Moratz et al. 2011], for OPRAm, it can be shown that none of the variants for any m are associative (see [Mossakowski et al. 2015]).\nThe B-variants of QTC violate only the identity laws R6, R6l. As observed in [Mossakowski 2007], it is possible to add a new id relation symbol, modify the interpretation of the remaining relation symbols such that they become JEPD, and adapt the converse and composition tables accordingly, thus obtaining relation algebras.\nThe C-variants of QTC additionally violate R4, R9, R10, and PL. Consequently, most of the reasoning optimizations described in Section 4.2 cannot be applied to the Cvariants of QTC. The remarkably few violations of R9, R10, and PL might be due to errors in the composition table, but the non-trivial verification is part of future work.\ncCDR and RCD are the only calculi with a weak converse in our tests. cCDR satisfies only W in addition to the axioms that are always satisfied by a Boolean algebra with distributivity. Hence, cCDR enjoys none of the advantages for representation and reasoning discussed before. Similarly to the C-variants of QTC, the relatively small number of violations of PL may be due to errors in the tables published. RCD additionally satisfies R4. Since both calculi satisfy neither R7 nor R9, current reasoning algorithms and their implementations yield incorrect results for them, as seen in Section 4.2."

Sometimes further elements of constraint languages are used in addition, for example, constants and difference operators as in the case of PIDN [Pujari and Sattar 1999], or a restricted form of disjunction [Li et al. 2013].\nIf several aspects of spatial and temporal knowledge are to be modeled, then combinations of calculi are relevant that make the interdependencies between the involved domains accessible. Wölfl and Westphal [2009] identify two general approaches to such combinations and reasoning therein: loose integration is based on the simple cross product of the base relations plus interdependency constraints [Gerevini and Renz 2002; Westphal and Wölfl 2008], and tight integration designs a new calculus internalizing the semantic interdependencies [Wölfl and Westphal 2009]. For example, INDU\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\ncombines IA and PC1 in a tight way, reducing the 13× 3 pairs of relations to the 25 semantically possible. A combination of RCC-8 with IA was introduced in [Gerevini and Nebel 2002]; several combinations of RCC-8 with direction calculi have been analyzed [Liu et al. 2009; Cohn et al. 2014]. In general, combinations do not inherit algebraic and reasoning properties from their constituent calculi (cf. Fig. 9 for INDU, PC1, IA).\nHernández [1994] describes the use of topological and orientation relations, which does not result in a dedicated calculus, but reveals the effects of constraining one aspect on reasoning in the other.\nAlternative ways to solve the combination problem include formalizing the domain and qualitative relations in an abstract logic – which typically are computationally more expensive – or applying the efficient paradigm of linear programming to qualitative calculi over real-valued domains [Kreutzmann and Wolter 2014]."

      "text" : "There have been several developments to enrich qualitative representation with concepts found in classical logics or to combine the two strands. Domain representations purely based on qualitative relations can be viewed as quantifier-free formulae with variables ranging over a certain spatial or temporal domain. QCSP instances can be posed as satisfiability problems of conjunctive constraint formulae in which variables are existentially quantified. Adopting this logic view for QCSPs leads to the field of spatial logics [Aiello et al. 2007], which is involved with combinations of qualitative calculi and logics. Already in the 1930s topological statements as those expressible in RCC were found to constitute a fragment of the modal logic S4 plus the universal modality (S4u), comprehensively described by Bennett [1997]. The cartesian product of S4u with linear temporal logic captures topological relationships that change over time [Bennett et al. 2002]. Qualitative relations and their interrelations can also be described by axiomatic systems, this approach has been argued to comprise the compositiontable approach and to support the construction of composition tables [Eschenbach 2001]. Axiomatic systems can be found, e.g., in [Eschenbach and Kulik 1997; Gotts 1996; Hahmann and Grüninger 2011]. The field of spatial logics can thus be viewed as a continuum between purely qualitative knowledge representation languages and logics. Current work is involved with understanding the computational complexity of increasing expressivity of qualitative relations, e.g., by introducing Boolean expressions of spatial variables PO(A ∩B,C) [Wolter and Zakharyaschev 2000], introducing a temporal modality [Kontchakov et al. 2007], or even combining spatial and temporal logics [Gabelaia et al. 2005]."

Already Knuth [1992] points out the importance of oriented matroids for qualitative spatial reasoning.

By posing QCSP instances as LPs, constraints originating in distinct calculi can easily be mixed. While some QSTR problems can almost directly be posed as LPs [Jonsson and Bäckström 1998; Ligozat 2011; Lee et al. 2013], disjunctive LP formulae allow several QSTR calculi to be handled simultaneously [Kreutzmann and Wolter 2014].

Techniques for deciding satisfiability of equations yield advancements on the inherent problem of consistency checking for directional constraints such as those present in the LR calculus, as (disjunctions of) linear equations can capture relevant geometric invariances [Lücke and Mossakowski 2010; van Delden and Mossakowski 2013]."

As a consequence, QSTR is connected to various research areas in and around artificial intelligence, such as knowledge representation, linguistics and spatial cognition. Thus QSTR plays the role of a hub for connecting symbolic techniques to real-world applications. The notion of a qualitative calculus attests to this role by representing knowledge about spatial and temporal domains as an abstract algebra that provides the semantics to knowledge representation languages. Reasoning with qualitative representations occurs in several forms, with deductive forms of inference, such as deciding consistency, being in a central position. This is captured in the qualitative constraint satisfaction problem, which is decidable for all qualitative calculi (in the strict sense of Definition 3.16), ranging from low-order polynomial time complexity to within PSPACE (cf. Table VII).

In order to accrete the position of QSTR as hub, sophisticated tools are necessary that disseminate formalisms and algorithms, linking basic research to application development. On the one hand, we provide pointers to all formalisms proposed and the decision methods necessary to perform reasoning. This also reveals commonalities between formalisms, hopefully gearing tools towards becoming universal in the sense that they allow many variants of representations to be handled. On the other hand – and related to the discrepancy between the amount of formalisms proposed and those fully analyzed discussed before – the most efficient algorithms to decide QCSP instances have often not yet been identified and solid algorithm engineering can likely yield a great leap ahead for QSTR."

Despite the work reported in Section 5.1, generally applicable methods for combining existing abstractions for different spatial and temporal aspects are missing – a potential threat to the applicability of qualitative methods. It is clearly not feasible to identify all potentially useful combinations individually: there are infinitely many abstractions that give rise to a qualitative calculus.\nIntegration with other symbolic methods. In addition to the above observation that an application may need to handle more than one calculus at the same time, expressivity provided by domain-independent knowledge representation techniques may be important too. There are first contributions (e.g., combining description logic with QSTR), but these are limited to specific combinations using specific methods. A promising approach is the integration of a variety of QSTR formalisms into a first-order framework [Bhatt et al. 2011]—the challenge being the development of efficient reasoning methods. We expect that this will result in a combination of first-order methods, constraintsolving methods, relation-algebraic methods and specialised methods for the existential theory over the reals, see [van Delden and Mossakowski 2013] for some first steps.\nIntegration with quantitative approaches. Qualitative approaches link metric data and symbolic reasoning, but consistent interpretation of sensor data considering its inevitable uncertainty is a recurring and challenging task. An algorithmic understanding of this problem has to the best of our knowledge not been developed yet. Conversely, it can also be helpful to link qualitative inference with quantitative or other kinds of constraints.

Abstract algebras provide the foundations for symbolic knowledge manipulation and enable optimizations to reasoning procedures. Our study gives an extensive account of algebraic properties of existing binary calculi, but we have also seen that it is highly non-trivial to extend this study to ternary calculi. The main problem is a missing notion of relation algebra already for ternary relations that is general enough to encompass the variety of existing calculi.\nPractical reasoning algorithms. Few of the various methods required in qualitative reasoning (see Table VIII) have been studied rigorously in a practical context. In the light of continuously growing data bases, identifying best-practice algorithms, evaluating the scaling behavior, and potentially developing heuristic approximations will be crucial to foster the relevance of QSTR methods.\nBy completing the picture of computational complexity and identifying practical solutions to reasoning with all individual calculi, either individually or in combination with one another or even other KR techniques, it will be possible to realize truly universal QSTR tools. These tools will foster the position of QSTR as a hub, not only conceptually, but implemented in almost all knowledge-based systems.\nELECTRONIC APPENDIX The electronic appendix for this article can be accessed in the ACM Digital Library."

      "text" : "Fact C.1. Consistency of QCSPs for DRA-conn can be decided in time O(n3).\nPROOF. The DRA-conn calculus is an abstraction of the more fine-grained dipole calculi, only retaining connectivity relations of line segments. Connectivity is represented by equality relations between positions of a dipole’s start or end point. For checking consistency of a set of DRA-conn constraints, the clusters of equally positioned points need to be constructed. This can easily be done with the algebraic closure algorithm. Since the effect of a disjunctive relation in DRA-conn with respect to single point equality is identical to absence of the constraint, reasoning with partial atomic QCSPs is equivalent in complexity to reasoning with general QCSPs with DRA-conn.\nFact C.2. Consistency of atomic QCSPs for EIA can be decided in polynomial time.\nPROOF. As described by Zhang and Renz [2014], extended interval algebra constraints can be translated to INDU constraint networks, and those can be decided in polynomial time [Balbiani et al. 2006]. EIA describes relative ordering with respect to interval start, end, and center point. Consequently, for every single variable in a given EIA network, the translation introduces three variables representing an interval and its two halves, together with the obvious constraints between them.\nFact C.3. The tractable subset of GenInt consisting of all strongly pre-convex general relations covers less than 1‰ of all relations for the case of 3-intervals.\nPROOF. Generalized intervals [Condotta 2000] generalize IA relations to tuples of intervals. Relations between a p- and and a q-tuple, general relations, are represented in a p × q matrix of IA relations. A strongly pre-convex general relation is a matrix\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nwhere all entries are strongly preconvex. Since the strongly pre-convex relations are a subset of pre-convex relations and only some 10% of all IA relations are pre-convex, at most a fraction of 0.1p·q of all general relations is strongly pre-convex, which is far less than 1‰ if p = q = 3. Even if we could take the matrix entries from a tractable subset of, say, 20% of IA, we would still get 0.2p·q 1‰ tractable relations.\nFact C.4. Deciding consistency of atomic QCSPs for OM-3D is NP-hard and can be reduced to solving multivariate polynomial equalities.\nPROOF. OM-3D generalizes the double-cross calculus from 2D arrangement to 3D arrangement, containing the 2D case as a sub-algebra. Since base relations of the 2D case are already NP-hard [Wolter and Lee 2010], so is OM-3D. All base relations for the 3D case can be modeled by multivariate polynomial equalities similar to the 2D case.\nFact C.5. Consistency of QCSPs with convex relations for STARm and STARrm can be decided in polynomial time.\nPROOF. STARm defines 4m relations (line segments and sectors); STARrm defines 2m relations which are all sectors. Tractability of convex relations follows from the observation that these can be represented by half-plane intersections using linear inequalities, systems of which can be decided in polynomial time using linear programming techniques.\nWhile the number of all relations in STAR(r)m grows exponentially with m, there are only m convex relations that include 1, . . . ,m relations, i.e., O(m2) convex relations. The percentage of convex relations thus decreases with increasing values of m."

      "text" : "We give additional proof sketches for expressivity relations presented in Figure 9. Recall that we say a calculus is of equivalent expressivity as another calculus if every QCSP instance of the first can be simulated by a propositional formulae of constraints in the second.\nTHEOREM D.1. Temporal calculi PC,IA,SIC,DIA,GenInt and spatial calculi BA, CDC, and CI form a cluster of expressivity.\nPROOF SKETCH. Temporal point- and interval-based calculi (semi-intervals in case of SIC) represent ordering relations which can all be translated into Boolean formulae of PC relations among interval start and end point. Solutions for QCSPs over these temporal calculi in the cluster can easily be obtained from their corresponding PC formulae by instantiating intervals from their start and and points.\nThe spatial calculus BA is an independent product IA×IA easily expressible using propositional BA formulae, analogously is CDC expressible as product PC×PC. CI represents a cyclic order (e.g., intervals of longitude). These relations can be simulated with PC by instantiating an lower and upper limit points p− and p+ and splitting all intervals containing either p− or p+ to continue from the opposite border.\nTHEOREM D.2. VR relations can be expressed using LR constraints.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\nPROOF SKETCH. VR expresses visibility of convex objects in the plane using ternary relations. Visibility relations can be represented based on the relative position of tangent points of the base entities, e.g., visibility between two objects is not affected if and only if a third object discrete from the first two does not intersect with the four-sided polygon obtained by connecting the upper and lower tangent points of the two objects. Overlap between polygonal contours can easily be written using LR constraints, e.g., a point is outside a convex polygon if it is located to the right hand side of at least one edge of the polygon, assuming the polygon edges to be ordered in counter-clockwise manner. The construction is then performed for every visibility relation, instantiating lower and upper tangent points individually for every pair of VR entities. The VR entities which are regions are then represented only by their set of tangent points which can be enforced to be arranged along a convex-shaped contour.\nTHEOREM D.3. Calculi TPCC,OPRA,EOPRA, 1-, and 2-cross constitute a cluster of equal expressive power for Boolean combinations of constraints.\nPROOF SKETCH. This group of calculi considers locations of points in the Euclidean plane. We first consider equivalence of OPRA, 1-, and 2-cross and later address TPCC and EOPRA which augment the first group by additional distance concepts. All calculi from the first group employ a partition scheme that is based on relations that specifies directions to points relative to some entity-specific orientation (either by reference to another entity in case of 1-, and 2-cross or as intrinsic part of the base entity in case of OPRA). Directions measured in radians are represented by membership in a finite and JEPD set of intervals partitioning (0, 2π], using solely rational ratios of π as boundaries. By geometric construction one can obtain any of these direction intervals (i.e., sectors) of these calculi from a any partition scheme for point location that is able to express superposition of points, a statement that two line segments connecting three points A,B,C meet in a right angle, i.e., ∠(A,B,C) = π2 as well as a statement saying that a point is located directly in front of some point P with respect to “front” orientation of P All the named calculi meet these conditions and allow for the following construction: Let P be the entity for which we seek to construct direction intervals in form of a sector. First, enforce four points A,B,C,D to form a rectangle with A in superposition with P and C in front of P . Next we construct E to be positioned on the intersection of AC and BD which meet in a right angle. Doing so we have constructed a square. Repeating the construction we can construct a grid from which we can derive the desired angular sectors.\nNow we show that OPRA, TPCC, and EOPRA have the same expressivity. EOPRA augments OPRA by a relative distance concept in the same way TPCC augments 1-cross. Constructions translating EOPRA to OPRA are very similar to translating TPCC to 1-cross, so we only consider the first case. Distance classes in the calculi OPRA and TPCC are named “close”, “same”, and “far” and are defined by comparison of the Euclidean distance between two entities with an object-specific threshold distance. This means that the statement “A is close to B” is independent from “B is close to A”. These distance constraints can be simulated in OPRA by introducing border points for each entity along the “same” distance, one for every pair of entities. To this end we have to enforce that all border points are in the same distance to their corresponding entity. This can be accomplished by OPRA constraints by first constructing a bisector for a pair of border points (as done in the construction above) and, second, enforcing a right angle between the line connecting two border points with the bisector.\nACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY."

    "abstractText" : "partition schemes. Ligozat and Renz [2004] note that most spatial and temporal calculi are based on a set of JEPD (jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint) domain relations. The following definition is predominant in the QSTR literature [Ligozat and Renz 2004; Cohn and Renz 2008]. Definition 3.4. Let U be a universe and R a set of non-empty domain relations of the same arity n. R is called a set of JEPD relations over U if the relations in R are jointly exhaustive, i.e., U = ⋃ r∈R r, and pairwise disjoint. ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY. A:8 Frank Dylla et al. An n-ary abstract partition scheme is a pair (U ,R) whereR is a set of JEPD relations over the universe U . The relations in R are called base relations. Example 3.5. The calculus PC1 is based on the binary abstract partition scheme S(PC1) := (R, {<,=, >}) where R is the set of reals and {<,=, >} is clearly JEPD. For RCC-5, the universe is often chosen to be the set of all regular closed subsets of the 2or 3-dimensional space R or R. The five base relations from Figure 4 (b) are JEPD. For CYCb, the universe is the set of all oriented line segments in the plane R, given by angles between 0° and 360°. The four base relations from Figure 4 (c) are JEPD. • In Definition 3.4, the universe U represents the set of all spatial (or temporal) entities. The main ingredients of a calculus will be relation symbols representing the base relations in the underlying partition scheme. A constraint linking an n-tuple t of entities via a relation symbol will thus represent complete information (modulo the qualitative abstraction underlying the partition scheme) about t. Incomplete information is modeled by t being in a composite relation, which is a set of relation symbols representing the union of the corresponding base relations. The set of all relation symbols represents the universal relation (the union of all base relations) and indicates that no information is available. Example 3.6. In PC1, “x < y” represents the relationship a < b, which holds complete information because < is atomic in S(PC1). The statement “x {<, =} y” represents the coarser relationship a 6 b holding the incomplete information “a < b or a = b”. Clearly “x {<, =, >} y” holds no information: “a < b or a = b or a > b” is always true. • The requirement that all base relations are JEPD ensures that every n-tuple of entities belongs to exactly one base relation. Thanks to PD (pairwise disjointness), there is a unique way to represent any composite relation using relation symbols and, due to JE (joint exhaustiveness), the empty relation can never occur in a consistent set of constraints, which is relevant for reasoning, see Section 3.2. Example 3.7. Consider the modification PC1 based on the non-PD set {6,>}. Then the relationship a = b can be expressed in two ways using relation symbols <= and >= representing 6 and >: “x <= y” and “x >= y”. Conversely, consider the variant PC 1 based on the non-JE set {<,>}. Then the constraint a = b cannot be expressed. Therefore, in any given set of constraints where it is known that x, y stand for identical entities, we would find the empty relation between x, y. The standard reasoning procedure described in Section 3.2 would declare such sets of constraints to be inconsistent, although they are not – we have simply not been able to express x = y. • Partition schemes, identity, and converse. Ligozat and Renz [2004] base their definition of a (binary) qualitative calculus on the notion of a partition scheme, which imposes additional requirements on an abstract partition scheme. In particular, it requires that the set of base relations contains the identity relation and is closed under the converse operation. The analogous definition by Condotta et al. [2006] captures relations of arbitrary arity. Before we define the notion of a partition scheme, we discuss the generalization of identity and converse to the n-ary case. The binary identity relation is given as usual by id = {(u, u) | u ∈ U}. (1) Example 3.8. Clearly, = in S(PC1) and “equals” in S(RCC-5) and S(CYCb) are the identity relation over the respective domain. • ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY. A Survey of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Calculi A:9 The most inclusive way to generalize (1) to the n-ary case is to fix a setM of numbers of all positions where tuples in id are required to agree. Thus, an n-ary identity relation is a domain relation idnM with M ⊆ {1, . . . , n} and |M | > 2, which is defined by idnM = {(u1, . . . , un) ∈ U | ui = uj for all i, j ∈M}. This definition subsumes the “diagonal elements” ∆ij of Condotta et al. [2006] for the case |M | = 2. However, it is not enough to restrict attention to |M | = 2 because there are ternary calculi which contain all identities id31,2, id 3 1,3, id 3 2,3, and id 3 1,2,3, an example being the LR calculus, which was described as “the finest of its class” [Scivos and Nebel 2005]. Since the relations in an n-ary abstract partition scheme are JEPD, all identities idnM are either base relations or subsumed by those. The stronger notion of a partition scheme should thus require that all identities be made explicit. For binary relations, id from (1) is the unique identity relation id2{1,2}. The standard definition for the converse operation  ̆ on binary relations is r̆ = {(v, u) | (u, v) ∈ r}. (2) Example 3.9. In S(PC1) we have that < ̆ is >; = ̆ is =; > ̆ is <. The converses of the base relations in S(RCC-5) and S(CYCb) were named in Examples 3.2 and 3.3. • In order to generalize the reversal of the pairs (u, v) in (2) to n-ary tuples, we consider arbitrary permutations of n-tuples. An n-ary permutation is a bijection π : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}. We use the notation π : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (i1, . . . , in) as an abbreviation for “π(1) = i1, . . . , π(n) = in”. The identity permutation ι : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (1, . . . , n) is called trivial; all other permutations are nontrivial. A finite set P of n-ary permutations is called generating if each n-ary permutation is a composition of permutations from P . For example, the following two permutations form a (minimal) generating set: sc : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (2, . . . , n, 1) (shortcut) hm : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (1, . . . , n− 2, n, n− 1) (homing) The names have been introduced in Freksa and Zimmermann [1992] for ternary permutations, together with a name for a third distinguished permutation: inv : (1, . . . , n) 7→ (2, 1, 3 . . . , n) (inversion) Condotta et al. [2006] call shortcut “rotation” (ry) and homing “permutation” (r#). Example 3.10. In Figure 5 we depict the permutations sc (rotation), hm (permutation), and inv for one relation from the ternary Double Cross Calculus (2-cross) [Freksa and Zimmermann 1992]. The 2-cross relations specify the location of a point P3 relative to an oriented line segment given by two points P1, P2. Figure 5 a shows the relation right-front. The relations resulting from applying the permutations are depicted in Figure 5 b; e.g., sc(right-front) = right-back because the latter is P1’s position relative to the line segment −−−→ P2P3. Figure 5 c will be relevant later. For n = 2, sc, hm and inv coincide; indeed, there is a unique minimal generating set, which consists of the single permutation  ̆ : (1, 2) 7→ (2, 1). For n > 3, there are several generating sets, e.g., {sc,hm} and {inv,hm}. Now an n-ary permutation operation is a map · that assigns to each n-ary domain relation r an n-ary domain relation denoted by r, where π is an n-ary permutation and the following holds: r = {(uπ(1), . . . , uπ(n)) | (u1, . . . , un) ∈ r} ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.
