      "text" : "Knowledge graphs (KGs), which provide significant well-structured information for modeling abstract concepts as well as concrete entities in real world, have attracted great attention in recent years.\n∗Corresponding author: Z. Liu (liuzy@tsinghua.edu.cn).\nA typical knowledge graph usually arranges multirelational data in the form of triple facts (head entity, relation, tail entity) that is abridged as (h, r, t).\nThere are large numbers of KGs like Freebase, YAGO and DBpedia that are widely utilized in nature language processing applications such as question answering and web search (Bollacker et al., 2008). However, applications for KGs are suffering from challenges of data sparsity and computational inefficiency with KG size increasing. To alleviate these problems, representation learning (RL) is proposed and widely used, significantly improving the capability of knowledge representations in knowledge inference, fusion and completion (Yang et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2015).\nMany methods have introduced representation learning to KGs, projecting both entities and relations into a continuous low-dimensional vector space (Nickel et al., 2011; Jenatton et al., 2012; Bordes et al., 2013). Among existing methods, translation-based models, which interpret relations as translating operations between head and tail entities, are effective and efficient that possess the stateof-the-art performance.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n07 07\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 Se\np 20\nFurthermore, rich external information is considered as supplement to triple facts that helps to represent knowledge graphs, and textual information has shown significant contribution to this goal. (Wang et al., 2014a; Zhong et al., 2015) propose a joint model projecting both entities and words into the same vector space with alignment models. However, their models only consider bag-of-words assumption when modeling words in plain texts, neglecting rich textual information embedded in word order. (Xie et al., 2016) directly builds entity representations from entity descriptions, while their model is restricted by the completeness and quality of entity descriptions.\nThere are two main shortages in existing methods for constructing knowledge representations from multiple sentences in plain texts: (1) The bag-ofwords assumption fails to encode explicit word order information into sentence representations. (2) Not all sentences containing entity names are reliable and suitable for explaining the corresponding entities. Fig. 1 demonstrates an example of multiple reference sentences for the entity economics. We can observe that the first two sentences talk about the definition and attributes of economics, which could represent the entity well, while the third one provides rather confusing and meaningless information for understanding the meaning of economics.\nAs shown in (Nagy et al., 1987), humans learn meanings of new words from their contextual information. Inspired by this, we intend to infer the meaning of an entity from its reference sentences. To overcome the shortages mentioned above, we propose the Sequential Text-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning (STKRL). Specifically, in our method, we first utilize recurrent neural network (RNN) with pooling or long short-term memory network (LSTM) to build sentence-level representations of an entity from multiple sentences. Each sentence-level representation is considered as a candidate of the corresponding entity representation. Second, we combine these sentence-level representations to form the summary text-based representation, with the favor of attention which highlights more informative sentences. Finally, we follow the margin-based score function in translationbased methods as our objective for training.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our model is the first model which combines multi-instance learning\nwith attention in knowledge representation learning with texts. We evaluate our models on triple classification and link prediction, and the significantly improved experimental results indicate our model is capable of representing knowledge graph better with textual information. Meanwhile, our model is of potential usefulness to definition extraction according to inspection towards the sentence attention component in our model."

      "heading" : "2.1 Translation-based Methods",
      "text" : "Translation-based methods have achieved great successes for representation learning in knowledge graphs. TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) interprets relations as translating operations between head and tail entities, and projects both entities and relations into the same continuous low-dimensional vector space. The energy function is defined as follows:\nE(h, r, t) = ||h+ r− t||, (1)\nwhich assumes that the tail embedding t should be in the neighborhood of h+ r. TransE is straightforward and effective, while this simple translating operation may have issues when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. Moreover, the translating operation only focuses on a single step, regardless of rich information located in long-distance relational paths. To address the first problem, TransH (Wang et al., 2014b) models translating operations between entities on relation-specific hyperplanes. TransR (Lin et al., 2015b) interprets entities and relations in different semantic spaces, and projects entities from entity space to relation space when learning the potential relationship between entities. TransD (Ji et al., 2015) proposes dynamic mapping matrix constructed by both entities and relations for multiple representations of entities. To extend the single-step translating operation, (Gu et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015a) encode multiple-step relation paths into representation learning of knowledge graphs and achieve significant improvements."

      "text" : "Multi-source information, especially textual information, is significant in representation learning of\nknowledge graphs, which has attracted great attention recently. It can provide useful information from different aspects, which helps modeling knowledge graphs. (Wang et al., 2014a) encodes both entities and words into a joint low-dimensional vector space by alignment models using entity names as well as Wikipedia anchors. (Zhong et al., 2015) extends the alignment model by considering entity descriptions. However, the methods of modeling plain texts in the both models above are rather simple, ignoring significant information encoded in word order. (Xie et al., 2016) proposes a new kind of representation for entities, which is directly constructed from entity descriptions using CNN and thus is capable of modeling new entities. However, their descriptionbased representation is restricted by the completeness as well as quality of entity descriptions. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first effort which learns knowledge representations from multiple sentences extracted from noisy plain texts with word order being considered."

Multi-instance learning aims to find out the reliability of examples in each object. (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007) extends a relation extraction method using minimal supervision with multi-instance learning. (Zhou et al., 2012) proposes multi-instance multi-label learning on multiple tasks such as scene classification and text categorization. (Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) adopt multi-instance learning in distant supervision for relation extraction. (Zeng et al., 2015) further combines multiinstance learning with convolutional neural network for relation extraction on distant supervision data. To fully utilize the rich textual information located in multiple sentences of each entity, we propose a sentence-level attention over multiple sentences to highlight more informative instances. To the best of our knowledge, multi-instance learning combined with attention-based model hasn’t been adopted in representation learning of knowledge graphs."

We set hK , tK as the structure-based representations of head and tail entities, which are the same as those in previous knowledge models, and hS , tS as the text-based representations, which are learned from plain texts by sentence encoders.\nFor each entity, we first scan through the corpus to extract all sentences which contain the corresponding entity name. These sentences are considered as the reference sentences of the corresponding entity."

ESS = ‖hS + r − tS‖ in which both head and tail are text-based representations learned from reference sentences. Similarly, we also have ESK = ‖hS + r− tK‖ and EKS = ‖hK + r− tS‖, jointly considering the two types of entity representations.\nThe overall architecture of the STKRL model is demonstrated in Fig. 2. First, The RNN/LSTM sentence encoder takes reference sentences as inputs and learns the sentence-level representations. Second, an attention method is implemented to select the top m (m is a hyper parameter) informative sentences to generate the text-based representation of an entity. The attention is based on the semantic similarity between the sentence-level representations and the corresponding structure-based representation. Finally, those representations will be learned jointly under the translation-based method."

Simply considering the mean or max of sentence embeddings will suffer from noises or lost rich information. Instead of taking the mean/max sentence embeddings, we propose an attention method to automatically select sentences which can explicitly explain the meaning of the entity. The attention-based model is powerful and has been widely applied to machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), abstractive sentence summarization (Rush et al., 2015) and speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2014). It can automatically highlight more informative instances from multiple candidates.\nWe implement an attention-based multi-instance learning method to select top-m informative reference sentences for the corresponding entity from all candidates. More specifically, each entity e has a structure-based representation eK . For a sentencelevel representation c which belongs to entity e, the attention between c and eK is as follows:\natt(c, eK) = c · eK\n‖c‖ · ‖eK‖ . (11)\nReference sentences with higher att(c, eK) are expected to better represent their corresponding entity information more explicitly. Finally, we pick the top-m reference sentences, and the text-based representation s is as follows:\ns = m∑ i=1 att(ci, eK) · ci∑ i=1,··· ,m att(ci, eK) . (12)"

There are two main challenges for constructing knowledge representations from plain texts: (1) How to take full advantages of sequential contexts of entities in plain texts for KRL. (2) How to dynamically select those informative sentences of the corresponding entities for KRL. In this paper, we propose the Sequential Text-embodied Knowledge Representation Learning to build knowledge representations from multiple sentences. Given each reference sentence of an entity, we first utilize recurrent neural network with pooling or long short-term memory network to encode the semantic information of the sentence with respect to the entity. Then we further design an attention model to measure the informativeness of each sentence, and build text-based representations of entities. We evaluate our method on two tasks, including triple classification and link prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other baselines on both tasks, which indicates that our method is capable of selecting informative sentences and encoding the textual information well into knowledge representations.",
