      "text" : "Sleep signals from a polysomnographic database are sequences in nature. Commonly employed analysis and classification methods, however, ignored this fact and treated the sleep signals as non-sequence data. Treating the sleep signals as sequences, this paper compared two powerful unsupervised feature extractors and three sequence-based classifiers regarding accuracy and computational (training and testing) time after 10-folds cross-validation. The compared feature extractors are Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. Whereas the compared sequence-based classifiers are Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and its variants, i.e., Hidden-state CRF (HCRF) and Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF); and Conditional Neural Fields (CNF) and its variant (LDCNF). In this study, we use two datasets. The first dataset is an open (public) polysomnographic dataset downloadable from the Internet, while the second dataset is our polysomnographic dataset (also available for download). For the first dataset, the combination of FCM and CNF gives the highest accuracy (96.75%) with relatively short training time (0.33 hours). For the second dataset, the combination of DBN and CRF gives the accuracy of 99.96% but with 1.02 hours training time, whereas the combination of DBN and CNF gives slightly less accuracy (99.69%) but also less computation time (0.89 hours).\nKeywords— Sleep stage, Conditional Neural Fields, Deep Belief Networks, Fuzzy C-Means Clustering, Classification\nIntroduction\nAccurate sleep stage classification is paramount in telemedicine and home care treatment of patients with a sleep disorder. Most sleep stage classification methods, however, ignored the nature of sleep signals as a sequence signal. We argue that this sequence nature is necessary to be considered and might bring more insightful pattern which ultimately delivers accurate classification. Many previous sleep stage classification methods treat sleep data as non-sequence data. They used wavelet and artificial neural networks [7], shallow classifiers [10], and Deep Belief Networks [27]. On the other hand, HMM is a widely known method for labeling sequence data [14]. This approach has been used in many areas such as speech [26], gesture [3], marine [21], health [2],and Biology [25], and also sleep stage [13] . However, HMM has some\n1/14\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n01 93\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 6\nO ct\nlimitations that the distribution of the conditional probability for hidden variable only at one time segment. To achieve better performance, Laferty et al. proposes the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to overcome the weakness of HMM [12]. CRF is a undirected graph model that combines the features of a complex observational sequence. Unlike HMM, CRF also accommodates bias in HMM [18].\nDue to its success in the sequence labeling, CRF variants have been developed with some additional functions such as hidden-state (in HCRF) to capture the interacting features in the data [4]. However, the HCRF eliminated the role of interacting labels, so the LDCRF was proposed to combine these factors [6], [24], [20]. Furthermore, the CRF and LDCRF have been further developed by adding a new layer to map the complex non-linear relationship. The new layer is called the gate, which is built into the internal processes [17]. Both these last methods are called as CNF and LDCNF.\nLängkvist conducts a sleep stage classification study, et al. [13]. They proposed an unsupervised learning for generating features by Deep Belief Networks (DBN). While not specifically treat the sleep data as a sequence, they compared the use of DBN-HMM and DBN-only classifiers. They found that the DBN-HMM (sequential treatment) gives better results DBN-only (non-sequential treatment). In this paper, we are interested in improving their classification performance by replacing the HMM part with CRF and CNF variants in handling the sequential data for sleep stage classification. Längkvist et al. [13] also found that hand-crafted features works better than machine-generated features automatically obtained from raw data. Inline with the finding, this study also employs hand-crafted features.\nWe also interested to investigate further the effectiveness of DBN as unsupervised features extractor in comparison with other features extractor such as FCM clustering. We compared many configurations regarding the accuracy and computation time. The required output of Deep Belief Networks is the probability of a segment for each class. It has similarities with the concept of cluster formation in an FCM clustering, in which, a segment is a member of all clusters with different membership degree. Based on such objective, the use of FCM clustering might be more optimal due to its concept of uncertainty, which enables no information loss in constructing new features. Therefore, this paper also proposes to examine the use of FCM clustering as the extraction of new features."

However, modeling by considering the dynamics, certainly, have an advantage in exploiting the correlation between labels. Some techniques are specifically modeled sequential data aimed at extracting such correlation, one of them is CRF [16].\nCRF modeling is based on the joint distribution of the data sequence X and a sequence label Y [1]. Both these sequences have the same length.\nX = x1, x2, x3, x4, . . . ..x(n) (1)\nY = y1, y2, y3, y4, . . . ..y(n) (2)\nwhere n is the length of the data segment, while x(n) is a feature vector data from sleep, which have a sequence label yn. Members of yn are the set of possible labels. In CRF, F is a global feature and consists of local features that are defined as follows [22]:\nF (Y,X) = ∑ i f(Y,X, n) (3)\nLocal features consist of state feature s(y, x, n) or transition feature t(y, y′, x, n) and each local feature vector must correspond to a weight vector λ. Thus, the model of CRF is defined as follows:\np(Y |X,λ) = expλF (Y,X) Z(X)\n(4)\nwhere Z(X,λ) = ∑ y P (h|θ)P (v|h, θ) (5)\nTraining the CRF can be done through maximizing the log-likelihood of the training set. It is given as follows: θ(λ) = ∑ k log p(Yk|Xk, λ) (6)\nFor improving the convergence of the model, some optimization techniques that commonly used are Conjugative Gradient (CG) and Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithms. The CRF has also been developed by adding some hyperparameters such as a layer of hidden states and gates. Both are further described in the following Subsections, and also compared in Figure 1."

To alleviate this limitation, HCRF is designed by adding an intermediate structure consisting of\n3/14\nsome hidden states into the CRF [5], [23]. Due to this intermediate structure, the conditional models of HCRF becomes as follows:\np(Y |X,λ) = ∑ h p(Y |h,X.λ)p(h|X,λ) (7)\nwhere h is the vector of the intermediate structure. HCRF structure designed to capture the correlation between the features of the data but ignores the dynamics of intercorrelated label that has been owned previously by the CRF structure. Therefore, LDCRF was developed to combine the CRF structure and HCRF [19].

The result of the first scheme becomes the input to the second scheme.\nDBN is composed of several Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). The RBM has a role in getting the weights of the adjacent two layers and constructs a new feature subset. To build a model, RBM uses some visible and hidden units. The units in the visible and hidden layers are interconnected each other, but no connections between units inside visible and units inside hidden layer. The reconstruction process is done through forward and backward mechanism from the top to the bottom of the RBM and vice-versa. Forward and backward process are often called encoding and decoding."

Although the object is in the membership of all clusters, the degree of membership for each cluster is different.

In this study, FCM used as a feature extraction so that it has the same role with DBN. The output of feature extraction to be achieved in this study is any data have a subset of features which these features have membership degree of data towards the centroids.\nThe FCM clustering algorithm is as follows:\n1.

      "text" : "Gate function in Conditional Neural Fields (CNF) maps the complex nonlinear relationship of input to output. The effectiveness of this additional function in CNF is shown in Table 1. The percentage of highest average accuracy was 95.98 when it used six gates, but others differed only slightly. It indicates the average accuracy of CNF tends to be stable even when changing the number of the gate. The same thing also happened on the required computation time. Without using DBN or FCM features, the CNF has achieved the average accuracy above 95 by using 28 features. However, through the implementation of DBN as feature extractor in Table 2, the CNF can reduce the computation time to within 0.04 to 0.06 hours range for each fold. Even though the accuracy is only slightly increased. Besides that, the highest accuracy of DBN achieved when used five gates. It seems that the DBN does work in giving the optimal subset of features so that the required number of gates needed to reach optimal conditions are also less.\nOn the other hand, the use of FCM clustering to extract four features from 28 features seems works so that CNF gives the highest accuracy. This accuracy is even better than the use of DBN even though the different is small. Using only four features. However, the required computation time is longer since the constructing of clusters takes a long time and affect the overall execution time for the classification process. In fact, the time required is longer than the classification without using additional feature extraction. As shown in Table 3, the average computation time ranges 0.3 hours up to\n7/14\n0.33 hours for each fold so that the feature extraction becomes ineffective since the increased accuracy is obtained only slightly but the computation time is much larger.\nThe implementation of CNF in Table 3 using four features obtained from FCM Clustering. These features represent the four clusters. The selection of only four of these features is based on tests performed in Table 4 which test the CNF performance for alteration of the number of clusters based on the accuracy and computation time. The result showed that the highest accuracy was obtained when using only four clusters and the accuracy was decreased when the number of clusters increased. However, unlike the computation time, which has an ascended trend when the number of clusters increased. From the table, it is also known that the highest computation time obtained when used eight clusters. Also, if the highest accuracy is achieved when four clusters are applied even though the number of clusters is a representation of the class label for sleep stage classification which is defined five classes, then it indicates that two classes have similar characteristics.\nIn implementing the FCM clustering to find a subset of features, we should also pay attention to the degree of fuzziness (w) is used. The higher w, a more blurred membership of a cluster. Hence, if the fuzziness is too high, then all objects have the same degree to all clusters. Therefore, it is necessary to find an optimal testing w St. Vincent’s dataset. The results are shown in Table 5. The accuracy tendency is decreasing with greater the degree of fuzziness (w) except implementations with w=1.2. The computation time has an upward trend in line with the increasing degree of fuzziness except for w = 1.05 which is higher than w = 1.1.\n8/14\nThe accuracy of CNF for this sleep stage classification ranges 91.07% up to 95.80 %. The performance of CNF increased when DBN and FCM applied. By using DBN, the achieved accuracy ranges 96.26 % up to 96.58. Even this performance has the highest performance when FCM is implemented. It ranges 96.47 % up to 96.75 %. Thus, it can be seen that the two additional methods are proven effective in improving the accuracy of CNF. Also, the CNF also proved as effective for classifying the sleep stage from St. Vincent’s dataset with the accuracy above 90%. An excellent performance of CNF for sleep stage classification can also be seen by comparing the other methods shown in Table 6.\nThe lowest accuracy obtained when using DBN is 84.47 %, then HCRF, LDCRF, CNF, and LDCNF although when they did not add any feature extraction. The HCRF gives lower accuracy than the CRF might be because it applied its intermediate layer but ignoring the factor of label interaction. When taking into account this label interaction factor, the LDCRF managed to give higher accuracy than HCRF. However, the accuracy of the LDCRF is still lower than the CRF. Maybe, it can be inferred that the addition of an intermediate layer causes a decrease in accuracy for sleep stage classification. On the other hand, the LDCNF accuracy is higher than the CNF. It means the gate function successfully find a subset of the features that have interacting features. By using this feature subset, the performance of the classification is increased when LDCNF also implements its hidden states to get the probabilistic models.\nWhen applied as a classifier, DBN showed the lowest accuracy. When applied as feature extractor, however, the DBN was proven effective in improving the accuracy of CRF, HCRF, LDCRF, CNF, and LDCNF. With DBN as feature extractor, the CNF has the highest accuracy than other methods which also use the DBN. From Table 6, it also known that DBN combined with CRF, CNF, and LDCNF have the higher accuracy than the DBN on Hidden Markov Models which proposed by Längkvist et.al. 2012 on the same dataset. Moreover, the accuracy of CNF was able to achieve 96.58 %. Also, by using FCM Clustering, the accuracy of CNF increases of 96.75 % but CRF decreased when compared using the DBN.\nAs for the computation time, the use of hidden state takes longer time than without hidden state. The HCRF Computation time was 1.96 hours, while for the CRF took only 0.58 hours when to apply the application of DBN as an additional feature extraction. The computation time increased when the external and internal structure of hidden states are both used. The LDCRF performance (with or without DBN as feature extractor). Besides that, it is also known that the gate function in CNF and LDCNF also proved effective to improve the accuracy and also decrease the computation time."

The accuracy of CNF decreased when FCM Clustering is used for feature extraction. The highest accuracy obtained is only 82.7 % when using three gates. This implementation is described in detail in Table 8. From the Table, it can be seen that the accuracy of FCM Clustering did not increase with the addition of one or two more gates, on the other hand, the computation time was increased with the addition. This indicates that the use of FCM clustering is worse than the DBN for CNF classifier.\nTests in Table 8 were performed to gain insight into the influence of the gate in CNF using a subset of the features derived from the FCM clustering.

    "abstractText" : "Sleep signals from a polysomnographic database are sequences in nature. Commonly employed analysis and classification methods, however, ignored this fact and treated the sleep signals as non-sequence data. Treating the sleep signals as sequences, this paper compared two powerful unsupervised feature extractors and three sequence-based classifiers regarding accuracy and computational (training and testing) time after 10-folds cross-validation. The compared feature extractors are Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. Whereas the compared sequence-based classifiers are Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and its variants, i.e., Hidden-state CRF (HCRF) and Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF); and Conditional Neural Fields (CNF) and its variant (LDCNF). In this study, we use two datasets. The first dataset is an open (public) polysomnographic dataset downloadable from the Internet, while the second dataset is our polysomnographic dataset (also available for download). For the first dataset, the combination of FCM and CNF gives the highest accuracy (96.75%) with relatively short training time (0.33 hours). For the second dataset, the combination of DBN and CRF gives the accuracy of 99.96% but with 1.02 hours training time, whereas the combination of DBN and CNF gives slightly less accuracy (99.69%) but also less computation time (0.89 hours).
