This representation is defined by degree of truth T, degree of falsity F and degree of neutrality I. This paper will redefine for the neutrosophic information the features presented above like truth, falsity, ignorance, over-definedness, underdefinedness, net truth, definedness, entropy and it introduces new features like neutrality, saturation and neutrosophic index. In the following, the paper has the structure: Section 2 presents the construction of net truth, definedness, neutrosophic score; Section 3 presents two calculus formulae for neutrosophic entropy; Section 4 presents a tetra-valued representation based on truth, falsity, neutrality and ignorance; Section 5 presents a penta-valued representation of neutrosophic information based on truth, falsity, neutrality, saturation and ignorance; Section 6 presents a penta-valued one based on truth, falsity, neutrality, over-definedness and under-definedness. Section 7 outlines some conclusions."

      "text" : "Multi-valued representation of neutrosophic information is presented in the paper, mainly in order to model features of its certainty and uncertainty. The proposed representations verify the condition of fuzzy partition and are accompanied by operators like negation, union and intersection. It was extended the concepts of certainty like truth and falsity, the concepts of uncertainty like ignorance, ambiguity, overdefinedness, under-definedness, entropy. In addition, it was defined new concepts related to the particularity of neutrosophy like saturation, neutrality and neutrosophic score. The particularization of the obtained formulae for neutrosophic information leads to some formulae that already exist in the specialty literature and are related to intuitionistic fuzzy information and fuzzy one. This fact proves the effectiveness of our approach.\nReferences\n1. Atanassov K.: Intuitionistic Fuzzy sets. Fuzzy Sets and Systems 20, 87-96, (1986) 2.
