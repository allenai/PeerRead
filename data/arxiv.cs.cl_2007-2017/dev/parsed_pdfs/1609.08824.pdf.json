This paper focuses on identifying and understanding mathematical relations described within a single sentence. We introduce the problem of Equation Parsing – given a sentence, identify noun phrases which represent variables, and generate the mathematical equation expressing the relation described in the sentence. We introduce the notion of projective equation parsing and provide an efficient algorithm to parse text to projective equations. Our system makes use of a high precision lexicon of mathematical expressions and a pipeline of structured predictors, and generates correct equations in 70% of the cases. In 60% of the time, it also identifies the correct noun phrase → variables mapping, significantly outperforming baselines. We also release a new annotated dataset for task evaluation."

      "text" : "Understanding text often involves reasoning with respect to quantities mentioned in it. Understanding the news article statement in Example 1 requires identifying relevant entities and the mathematical relations expressed among them in text, and determining how to compose them. Similarly, solving a math word problem with a sentence like Example 2, requires realizing that it deals with a single number, knowing the meaning of “difference” and compos-\nExample 1 Emanuel’s campaign contributions total three times those of his opponents put together. Example 2 Twice a number equals 25 less than triple the same number. Example 3 Flying with the wind , a bird was able to make 150 kilometers per hour. Example 4 The sum of two numbers is 80. Example 5 There are 54 5-dollar and 10- dollar notes.\ning the right equation – “25” needs to be subtracted from a number only after it is multiplied by 3.\nAs a first step towards understanding such relations, we introduce the Equation Parsing task - given a sentence expressing a mathematical relation, the goal is to generate an equation representing the relation, and to map the variables in the equation to their corresponding noun phrases. To keep the problem tractable, in this paper we restrict the final output equation form to have at most two (possibly coreferent) variables, and assume that each quantity mentioned in the sentence can be used at most once in the final equation.1 In example 1, the gold output of an equation parse should be V1 = 3 × V2, with V1 = “Emanuel’s campaign contributions” and V2 = “those of his opponents put together”.\nThe task can be seen as a form of semantic parsing (Goldwasser and Roth, 2011; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013) where instead of mapping a sentence to a logical form, we want to map\n1We empirically found that around 97% of sentences describing a relation have this property.\nit to an equation. However, there are some key differences that make this problem very challenging in ways that differ from the “standard” semantic parsing. In Equation Parsing, not all the components of the sentence are mapped to the final equation. There is a need to identify noun phrases that correspond to variables in the relations and determine that some are irrelevant and can be dropped. Moreover, in difference from semantic parsing into logical forms, in Equation Parsing multiple phrases in the text could correspond to the same variable, and identical phrases in the text could correspond to multiple variables.\nWe call the problem of mapping noun phrases to variables the problem of grounding variables. Grounding is challenging for various reasons, key among them are that: (i) The text often does not mention “variables” explicitly, e.g., the sentence in example 3 describes a mathematical relation between the speed of bird and the speed of wind, without mentioning “speed” explicitly. (ii) Sometimes, multiple noun phrases could refer to the same variable. For instance, in example 2, both “a number” and “the same number” refer to the same variable. On the other hand, the same noun phrase might refer to multiple variables, as in example 4, where the noun phrase “two numbers” refer to two variables.\nIn addition, the task involves deciding which of the quantities identified in the sentence are relevant to the final equation generation. In example 5, both “5” and “10” are not relevant for the final equation “V1 + V2 = 54”. Finally, the equation needs to be constructed from a list of relevant quantities and grounded variables. Overall, the output space becomes exponential in the number of quantities mentioned in the sentence.\nDetermining the final equation that corresponds to the text is an inference step over a very large space. To address this, we define the concept of “projectivity” - a condition where the final equation can be generated by combining adjacent numbers or variables, and show that most sentences expressing mathematical relations exhibit the projectivity property. Finally, we restrict our inference procedure to only search over equations which have this property.\nOur approach builds on a pipeline of structured predictors that identify irrelevant quantities, recognize coreferent variables, and, finally, generate equa-\ntions. We also leverage a high precision lexicon of mathematical expressions and develop a greedy lexicon matching strategy to guide inference. We discuss and exemplify the advantages of this approach and, in particular, explain where the “standard” NLP pipeline fails to support equation parsing, and necessitates the new approach proposed here. Another contribution of this work is the development of a new annotated data set for the task of equation parsing. We evaluate our method on this dataset and show that our method predicts the correct equation in 70% of the cases and that in 60% of the time we also ground all variables correctly.\nThe next section presents a discussion of related work. Next we formally describe the task of equation parsing. The following sections describe our equation representation and the concept of projectivity, followed by the description of our algorithm to generate the equations and variable groundings from text. We conclude with experimental results."

      "text" : "The work most related to this paper is (Madaan et al., 2016), which focuses on extracting relation triples where one of the arguments is a number. In contrast, our work deals with multiple variables and complex equations involving them. There has been a lot of recent work in automatic math word problem solving (Kushman et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2015; Hosseini et al., 2014; Roy and Roth, 2015). These solvers cannot handle sentences individually. They require the input to be a complete math word problem, and even then, they only focus on retrieving a set of answer values without mentioning what each answer value corresponds to. Our work is also conceptually related to work on semantic parsing – mapping natural language text to a formal meaning representation (Wong and Mooney, 2007; Clarke et al., 2010; Cai and Yates, 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Goldwasser and Roth, 2011). However, as mentioned earlier, there are some significant differences in the task definition that necessitate the development of a new approach."

      "heading" : "3 The Equation Parsing Task",
      "text" : "Equation parsing takes as input a sentence x describing a single mathematical equation, comprising one or two variables and other quantities mentioned in x. Let N be the set of noun phrases in the sentence x. The output of the task is the mathematical equation described in x, along with a mapping of each variable in the equation to its corresponding noun phrase in N . We refer to this mapping as the “grounding” of the variable; the noun phrase represents what the variable stands for in the equation. Table 1 gives an example of an input and output for the equation parsing of the text in example 2. Since an equation can be written in various forms, we use the form which most agrees with text, as our target output. So, for example 1, we will choose V1 = 3 × V2 and not V2 = V1 ÷ 3. In cases where several equation forms seem to be equally likely to be the target equation, we randomly choose one of them, and keep this choice consistent across the dataset."

      "text" : "In this section, we introduce an equation parse for a sentence. An equation parse of a sentence x is a pair (T,E), where T represents a set of triggers extracted from x, and E represents an equation tree formed with the set T as leaves. We now describe these terms in detail. Trigger Given a sentence x mentioning a mathematical relation, a trigger can either be a quantity trigger expressed in x, or variable trigger which is a noun phrase in x corresponding to a variable. A quantity trigger is a tuple (q, s), where q is the numeric value of the quantity mentioned in text, and s is the span of text from the sentence x which refers to the quantity. A variable trigger is a tuple (l, s), where l represents the label of the variable, and s represents the noun phrase representing the variable. For example, for the sentence in Fig 1, the spans “Twice”, “25”, and “triple” generate quantity triggers, whereas “a number” and “the same number” generate variable\ntriggers, with label V1. Trigger List The trigger list T for a sentence x contains one trigger for each variable mention and each numeric value used in the final equation expressed by the sentence x. The trigger list might consist of multiple triggers having the same label, or extracted from the same span of text. In the example sentence in Fig 1, the trigger list comprises two triggers having the same label V1. The final trigger list for the example in Fig 1 is {(2, “2”), (V1, “a number”), (25, “25”), (3, “triple”), (V1, “the same number”)}. Note that there can be multiple valid trigger lists. In our example, we could have chosen both variable triggers to point to the same mention “a number”. Quantity triggers in the trigger list form the quantity trigger list, and the variable triggers in trigger list form the variable trigger list. Equation Tree An equation tree of a sentence x is a binary tree whose leaves constitute the trigger list of x, and internal nodes (except the root) are labeled with one of the following operations – addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. In addition, for nodes which are labeled with subtraction or division, we maintain a separate variable to determine order of its children. The root of the tree is always labeled with the operation equal.\nAn equation tree is a natural representation for an equation. Each node n in an equation tree repre-\nsents an expression EXPR(n), and the label of the parent node determines how the expressions of its children are to be composed to construct its own expression. Let us denote the label for a non-leaf node n to be ⊙(n), where ⊙(n) ∈ {+,−,×,÷,=} and the order of a node n’s children by ORDER(n) (defined only for subtraction and division nodes), which takes values lr (Left-Right) or rl (Right-Left). For a leaf node n, the expression EXPR(n) represents the variable label, if n is a variable trigger, and the numeric value of the quantity, if it is a quantity trigger. Finally, we use lc(n) and rc(n) to represent the left and right child of node n, respectively. The equation represented by the tree can be generated as follows. For all non-leaf nodes n, we have\nEXPR(n) = \n         \n         \nEXPR(lc(n))⊙(n) EXPR(rc(n))\nif ⊙(n) ∈ {+,×,=}\nEXPR(lc(n))⊙(n) EXPR(rc(n))\nif ⊙(n) ∈ {−,÷} ∧ ORDER(n) = lr\nEXPR(rc(n))⊙(n) EXPR(lc(n))\nif ⊙(n) ∈ {−,÷} ∧ ORDER(n) = rl\n(1)\nGiven an equation tree T of a sentence, the equation represented by it is the expression generated by the root of T (following Equation 1). Referring to the equation tree in Fig 1, the node marked “−r” represents (3× V1) − 25, and the root represents the full equation 2× V1 = (3× V1)− 25."

In other words, the span of the left child and the right child cannot intersect in a projective equation tree2.\nThe key observation, as our corpus analysis indicates, is that for most sentences, there exists a trigger list, such that the equation tree representing the relation in the sentence is projective. However this might involve mapping two mentions of the same variable to different noun phrases. Figure 1 shows an example of a projective equation tree, which requires different mentions of V1 to be mapped to different noun phrases. If we had mapped both mentions of V1 to same noun phrase “a number”, the resulting equation tree would not have been projective. We collected 385 sentences which represent\n2This is more general than the definition of projective trees used in dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).\nan equation with one or two mentions of variables, and each number in the sentence used at most once in the equation. We found that only one sentence among these could not generate a projective equation tree. (See Section 6.1 for details on dataset creation). Therefore, we develop an algorithmic approach for predicting projective equation trees, and show empirically that it compares favourably with ones which do not make the projective assumption."

      "text" : "The goal of this step is to predict the variable trigger list for the equation. Our structured classifier takes as input the sentence x, and the output y is either one or two noun-phrases, representing variables in the final equation. As we pointed out earlier, multiple groundings might be valid for any given variable, hence there can be multiple valid variable trigger lists. For every sentence x, we construct a set Y of valid outputs. Each element in Y corresponds to a valid variable trigger list. Finally, we aim to output only one of the elements of Y .\nWe modified the standard structured prediction algorithm to consider “superset supervision” and take into account multiple gold structures for an input x. We assume access to N training examples of the form : (x1, Y1), (x2, Y2), . . . , (xN , YN ), where each Yi is a set of valid outputs for the sentence xi. Since we want to output only one variable trigger list, we want to score at least one y from Yi higher than all other possible outputs, for each xi. We use a modified latent structured SVM to learn the weight vector w. The algorithm treats the best choice among all of Yi as a latent variable. At each iteration, for all xi, the algorithm chooses the best choice y∗i from the set Yi, according to the weight vector w. Then, w is updated by learning on all (xi, y∗i ) by a standard structured SVM algorithm. The details of the algorithm are in Algorithm 1. The distinction from standard latent structural SVM is in line 5 of Algorithm 1. In order to get the best choice y∗i for input xi, we search only inside Yi, instead of all of Y . A similar formulation can be found in Björkelund and Kuhn (2014). The features φ(x, y) used for variable trigger prediction include variable features (properties of noun phrase indicating variable) and neighborhood features (lexical features from neighborhood of variable mention). Details added to the appendix.\nIf the output of the classifier is a pair of noun phrases, we use a rule based variable coreference detector, to determine whether both noun phrases should have the same variable label or not.

      "text" : "It is natural to assume that the syntactic parse of the sentence could be very useful in addressing all the predictions we are making in the equation parsing tasks. However, it turns out that this is not the case – large portions of the syntactic parse will not be part of the equation parse, hence we need the aforementioned modules to address this. Nevertheless, in the next task of predicting the equation tree, we attempted to constraint the output space using guidance from the syntactic tree; we found, though, that even enforcing this weak level of output expectation is not productive. This was due to the poor performance of current syntactic parsers on the equation data (eg., in 32% of sentences, the Stanford parser made a mistake which does not allow recovering the correct equation).\nThe tree prediction module receives the trigger list predicted by the previous two modules, and the goal\nis to create an equation tree using the trigger list as the leaves of that tree. The input x is the sentence and the trigger list, and the output y is the equation tree representing the relation described in the sentence. We assume that the output will be a projective equation tree. For features φ(x, y), we extract for each non-leaf node n of the equation tree y, neighborhood features (from neighborhood of node spans of n’s children), connecting text features (from text between the spans of n’s children) and number features (properties of number in case of leaf nodes). Details are included in the appendix.\nThe projectivity assumption implies that the final equation tree can be generated by combining only adjacent nodes, once the set of leaves is sorted based on Span-Start(·) values. This allows us to use CKY algorithm for inference. A natural approach to further reduce the output space is to conform to the projective structure of the syntactic parse of the sentence. However, we found this to adversely affect performance, due to the poor performance of syntactic parser on equation data. Lexicon To bootstrap the equation parsing process, we developed a high precision lexicon to translate mathematical expressions to operations and orders, like “sum of A and B” translates to “A+B”, “A minus B” translates to “A-B”, etc. (where A and B denote placeholder numbers or expressions). At each step of CKY, while constructing a node n of the equation tree, we check for a lexicon text expression corresponding to node n. If found, we allow only the corresponding operation (and order) for node n, and do not explore other operations or orders. We show empirically that reducing the space using this greedy lexicon matching help improve performance. We found that using the lexicon rules as features instead of hard constraints do not help as much. Note that our lexicon comprises only generic math concepts, and around 50% of the sentences in our dataset do not contain any pattern from the lexicon.\nFinally, given input sentence, we first predict the quantity trigger and the variable trigger lists. Given the complete trigger list, we predict the equation tree relating the components of the trigger list."

To investigate this, we developed a structured SVM which predicts all components jointly, using the union of the features of each component. We use approximate inference, first enumerating possible trigger lists, and then equation trees, and find the best scoring structure. However, this method did not outperform the pipeline method. The worse performance of joint learning is due to: (1) search space being too large for the joint model to do well given our dataset size of 385, and (2) our independent classifiers being good enough, thus supporting better joint inference. This tradeoff is strongly supported in the literature (Punyakanok et al., 2005; Sutton and McCallum, 2007).\nAnother option is to enforce constraints between trigger list predictions, such as, variable triggers should not overlap with the quantity triggers. However, we noticed that often noun phrases returned by the Stanford parser were noisy, and would include neighboring numbers within the extracted noun phrases. This prevented us from enforcing such constraints."

Financial news headlines were extracted from The Latest News feed of MarketWatch, over the month of February, 2015. All sentences with information describing a mathematical relation among at most two (possibly coreferent) variables, were chosen. Next, we pruned sentences which require multiple uses of a number to create the equation. This only removed a few time related sentences like “In 10 years, John will be twice as old as his son.”.

Therefore, for each annotated span, we extracted the noun phrase with maximum overlap with the span, and used it to represent the variables.

Although this choice might be sufficient for downstream tasks, we consider it to be incorrect in our current evaluation. Another 25% of the errors were due to selection of entities which do not participate in the relation. For example, in “A rancher raises 5 times as many cows as horses.”, our predictor chose “A rancher” and “cows” as variables, whereas the relation exists between “cows” and “horses”. For the prediction of the equation tree, we found that 35% of the errors were due to rare math concepts expressed in text. For example, “7 dollars short of the price” represents 7 dollars should be subtracted from the price. These errors can be handled by carefully augmenting the lexicon.

In such cases, the annotators were asked to annotate the associated entities “the wind” and “a bird” as representing variables.\nThe guidelines also directed annotators to choose the longest possible mention, in case they feel the mention boundary is ambiguous. As a result, in the sentence, “City Rentals rent an intermediate-size car for 18.95 dollars plus 0.21 per mile.”, the phrase “City Rentals rent an intermediate-size car” was annotated as representing variable. We allow multiple mentions to be annotated for the same variable. In example 2 (Section 1), both “a number” and “the same number” were annotated as representing the same variable."

We introduce the notion of projective equation parsing and provide an efficient algorithm to parse text to projective equations. Our system makes use of a high precision lexicon of mathematical expressions and a pipeline of structured predictors, and generates correct equations in 70% of the cases. In 60% of the time, it also identifies the correct noun phrase → variables mapping, significantly outperforming baselines. We also release a new annotated dataset for task evaluation.",
