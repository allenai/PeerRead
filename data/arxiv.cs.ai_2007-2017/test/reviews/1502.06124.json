The progress in its solution will be greatly beneficial for further advances of information retrieval, ontology alignment, relevance calculation, text mining, natural language processing etc. In the paper the concept of multidimensional global knowledge map, elaborated through unsupervised extraction of dependencies from large documents corpus, is proposed. In addition, the problem of direct Human - Knowledge Representation System interface is addressed and a concept of adaptive decoder proposed for the purpose of interaction with previously described unified mapping model. In combination these two approaches are suggested as basis for a development of a new generation of knowledge representation systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Feb 2015 18:29:57 GMT  (167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06124v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["dmytro filatov", "taras filatov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.06124"}
