Limited amount of available high-dimensional data and its sensitivity to noise pose computational challenges to find symmetry. Our paper presents a new method to find local symmetries in a low-dimensional 2-D grid structure which is embedded in high-dimensional structure. To compute the symmetry in a grid structure, we introduce three legal grid moves (i) Commutation (ii) Cyclic Permutation (iii) Stabilization on sets of local grid squares, grid blocks. The three grid moves are legal transformations as they preserve the statistical distribution of hamming distances in each grid block. We propose and coin the term of grid symmetry of data on the 2-D data grid as the invariance of statistical distributions of hamming distance are preserved after a sequence of grid moves. We have computed and analyzed the grid symmetry of data on multivariate Gaussian distributions and Gamma distributions with noise."

      "text" : "The current hurdle in big data is to develop machine learning representations which can extract meaningful features. The principle of symmetry plays a natural foundation in the development of such a learning representation by getting rid of unimportant variations, while making the important ones easy to detect. Exploiting symmetries reduces computational complexity and leads to the development of new generalizations of learning algorithms and provides a new approach in deep symmetry networks [Gens and Domingos, 2014; Badrinarayanan et al., 2015]. There is recent interest in exploiting cyclic symmetry in convolution neural network architectures[Dieleman et al.,\n2016; Dieleman et al., 2015]. Encoding these properties in networks by using the transnational equivariance allows the model for parameter budgeting efficiently.\nSearching for symmetry in high-dimensional objects under certain low complexity constraints though possible is a computationally challenging task. Symmetry based machine learning are broadly classified as (1) Exchangeable variable models [Niepert and Domingos, 2014] (2) Deep Symmetry Networks (3) Symmetry based semantic parsing [Poon and Domingos, 2009].\nOne way to solve this problem is to use a topologypreserving dimensionality reduction method, and then search for symmetrical structures. High-dimensional models with low-dimensional structures of patterns or symmetry are ubiquitous. Extracting low-dimensional structures in high-dimensional models have widespread uses in various disciplines including neuroscience, economics, and genetics. Our work is inspired by the Noether’s Theorem of unification symmetry and conservation in theoretical physics [Schwarzbach and Kosmann-Schwarzbach, 2010]. This paper presents a novel method of searching symmetry on 2−D grid space, where the Betti number, an important topological property in persistent homology, is computed (or efficiently approximated). We define three grid moves (i) Commutation (ii) Cyclic Permutation (iii) Stabilization on grid blocks, consisting of a finite number of local grid squares. Our algorithm finds symmetry in each grid block after a finite sequence of grid moves. We prove the upper bound of the Hamming distance H(n) is bounded. We have used the metric of Hamming distance as measure of randomness in the search of symmetry. The randomness may come from the added noise in the signal data or inherently embedded in the data. Our proposed method of topological data processing is immune the to effect of noise for most cases and is used for searching the local symmetry. Our method of estimating the upper bound of the Hamming distance H(n) can be useful in detecting the phase change in data, which have profound implications in security, finance, and other areas.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows: Section 2\ngives a quick introduction to Low-Dimensional Topological Models, Subsection 2 will introduce the newly construct of Grid Diagrams perspective, Section 3 will explain our method of searching symmetry, Section 4 explain our newly proposed Ising model of data, Section 5 explains the related work, Section 6 presents our experimental results and Section 7 concludes the paper. We have used the following important notations in our paper\nNotations\n(1) β Betti number (2) H Hamming distance (3) g Small square grid (4) G 2D Grid (5) l Dimension of small grid (6) H Hamiltonian (7) σ Configuration (8) Jg1,g2 Grid interaction parameter (9) Γ(l) Scaling invariant parameter (10) T1,T2,T3 Commutation, Cyclic Permutation, Stabilization"

      "text" : "Our Algorithm of finding the symmetry in Data uses the topological features to search the local symmetry. Our method is of general nature and features other than the topological ones can be extended in it. We encode our Data space as a topological space, because of its highdimensional features (symmetry and connectivity) can be inferred from its low-dimensional, local representations as in [Chen and Rong, 2010; Edelsbrunner, 2007; Carlsson, 2014].\nTopological Invariants on Data Manifolds\nComputing topological invariants in low-dimensional space is used for exploring the symmetry in data space in our paper. Homology groups are increasingly used in computing the invariants as their computations are more feasible and provide the important information about the shape of the object. The homology groups for the 2−D object are computed efficiently by the digitization [Evako, 2006; Chen and Rong, 2010; Chen, 2004]. Digital topology allows discretizing data object by integrating the geometric and topological constraints. The digital model of a 2−dimensional continuous object is called a digital 2−surface. The intrinsic topology of the object is used without referring to an embedding space. A set D is defined as a 2−cell if it is homeomorphic to a closed unit square, similarly, a set D is a 1−cell if it is homeomorphic to a closed unit segment and a set D is a circle(or 1−sphere) if it is homeomorphic to a unit circle. The interior and the boundary of an n−cell D, are denoted as IntD and ∂D with\nthe following boundary condition\nD = IntD∪∂D (1)\nIntuitively we can visualize the boundary of a 1− cell has two endpoints, the boundary of a 2−cell is a circle. For the sake of completeness, we define 0−cell as a single point for which ∂D = /0. The following properties hold for digital topology • For a circle C and a 1−cell D contained in C the set C− IntD is a 1−cell. • If 1−cells C1 and C2 are such that C1∩C2 = ∂C1∩∂C2 = v holds, then C1 ∪C2 = E is a 1−cell. • For 2−cells D1 and D2 such that D1∩D2 = ∂D1∩∂D2 = C is a 1−cell holds, then D1 ∪D2 = B is a 2− cell. • An (i+ 1)−cell can be formed by two disjoint i−cells that are parallel • An i−cell and it’s parallel move form an (i+ 1)−cell. We now formally define the Digital Surface as\nDefinition (Digital Surface). A digital surface is the set of surface points each of which has two adjacent components not in the surface in its neighborhood\nIn 2−D space, algorithms to compute Betti numbers are of complexity O(n log2 n) or O(n log3 n). Our paper use the properties of manifolds in 2−D digital spaces for the computation of topological invariants. We formally define digital manifold as\nDefinition (Digital Manifold). A connected subset S in digital space ∑ is a i−D digital manifold if • Any two i−cells are (i− 1) connected in S • Every (i-1)cell in S has only one or two parallel-moves in S • S does not contain any (i+ 1)−cell\nWe represent a compact 3−dimensional manifold in R3 by a surface. Then the homology group is expressed in terms of its boundary surface. The Betti numbers related to homology groups are used in topological classification. For a k− manifold, homology group Hi, i = 0, · · · ,k, indicates the number of holes in each i−skeleton of the manifold. For a topological space M, its homology groups, Hi(M) are certain measures of i−dimensional holes in M.\nDefinition (Betti number). The Betti number β is formally defined as the rank of the quotient group as\nβ = rankHi(M) (2)\nIn our algorithm we use the statistical distribution of Betti number β in each small grid square of length l for computing of local symmetry.\nGrid Diagrams for Low-Dimensional Topology\nA grid diagram is defined as a two dimensional square grid such that each square inside the grid is filled with symbols x, o or is left blank, with the constraint such that every column and every row has exactly one x and one o. The symbols x and o are abstract decorations that fill the small grid square.\nThe grid number for the grid diagram is the number of columns (or rows). The grid diagram is associated with an equivalent knot by joining the x and o symbols in each column and row by a straight line with the convention of vertical lines crosses over the horizontal lines (as shown by the dotted red lines in Figure 1). These lines joining the symbols x and o form the strands of the knot and removing the grid give us the planar projection of the knot (trivial knot in our example) as shown in Figure 1 [Manolescu, 2012; Ozsváth et al., 2015; Sarkar, 2010]. Grid diagrams are extensively used recently because of the use the grids gives a combinatorial definition of knot Floer homology [Sarkar and Wang, 2010].\nThree grid moves (explained in Section 3) to relate the grid diagrams are (1) Commutation (T1) (2) Cyclic Permutations (T2) (3) Stabilization (T3) [Manolescu, 2012; Ozsváth et al., 2015; Sarkar, 2010]. These grid moves are analogous to Reidemeister moves for knot diagrams. The grid moves are used to generate equivalent relations. Theorem 1 explains that a sequence of grid moves gives the invariant knots. A knot invariant is defined in the form of a polynomial such as the Alexander polynomial, Conway polynomial, HOMFLY polynomial, Jones polynomial etc.\nTheorem 1. [Reidemeister, 1932] G1 is a grid diagram with its equivalent knot K1 and grid diagram G2 with its equivalent knot K2. K1 and K2 are equivalent knots if and only if there exists a sequence of commutation, stabilization and cyclic permutation grid moves transform G1 to G2.\nOur goal in this paper is to define the symmetrical invariance in grid diagrams under uncertainty. For searching the local symmetry we have moved away from generating knots from the planar grid diagrams and instead use the distribution of hamming distance among the grid blocks explained in Section 3. A finite sequence of operations T comprising of Commutation, Cyclic Permutation, Stabilization in a defined order is\nT = T a1 ◦T b 2 ◦T c 3 (3)\nwhere a,b,c ∈ R. The stabilization operations T3 of kink addition and kink subtraction occur in pairs to maintain the constant grid number."

      "text" : "Inference in high dimensional data is challenge because of the curse of dimensionality. Thus, high dimensional data are usually converted to low-dimensional codes by (1) Neural Networks [Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006]; (2) Nonlinear dimension reduction [Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Lee and Verleysen, 2007]; and (3) Topological and Geometric methods [Wang, 2012].\nIn this paper, we propose a new form of symmetry termed a grid symmetry with the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis 2 (Invariance of Symmetric Probability). The symmetry on a grid is represented by Commutation, Cyclic Permutation and Stabilization. The statistical distribution of the Betti numbers remains conserved during the above defined legal transformations.\nSymmetry of a geometric object comes with the concept of automorphisms. Legal transformations allowed for grid diagrams are 1 Commutation (2) Cyclic Permutations (3) Stabilization defined as in [Ozsváth et al., 2015; Manolescu, 2012; Sarkar and Wang, 2010; Sarkar, 2010; Ozs, 2004; Hedden, 2008; Reidemeister, 1932]. Commutation: Commutation is defined as an interchange of two consecutive rows or columns of a grid diagram. The commutation is permitted only between rows or columns those are non-nested.\nCyclic Permutation: Cyclic permutation preserves the grid number and is defined as the removal of an outer row/column and replacing it to the opposite side of the grid.\nStabilization: Stabilization is performed by kink addition or removal and thus does not preserve the grid number. A\nkink is added either to the right or left of a column or above or below of a row. Adding a kink to a column c is done by inserting an empty row between the symbols x and o of the column c. Then an empty column is inserted either to the right or left of column c. We then move the either symbol x or o to the adjacent grid square in the added column. We then complete the added row and column with the symbols x and o appropriately. To add a kink to a row, we have to swap the row and column operations. To remove a kink (grid number decreases by 1), we follow the instructions in reverse order.\nAfter projecting the high dimensional data to our 2D grid space, we compute the Betti number β in each small grid square of length l. We compute only a particular order of Betti number βk for a fixed k and mark the grid square with the Betti number if βk 6= 0 and leave the grid square empty if βk = 0. For example we fill up the small grid square if the number of holes in it is at least 1 i.e β2 6= 0 and leave the grid square empty when β2 = 0. We have used the symbol β to represent βk for fixed k. We introduce this binary topological marking to get the sparse representation. For sufficiently sparse data we get a grid diagram where most of small grid squares are left empty and others are marked with β . This binary marking makes our model consistent with the grid homology for the studying of invariance of knots. Here, the difference is that we investigate the invariance of the probabilistic distribution of Betti numbers using the metric of Hamming distance.\nAfter the marking of the grid squares, we randomly sample a square grid block of size l consisting of n2 small grid squares and apply a finite sequence of operations T defined in Equation 8 on the sampled grid block as shown in Figure 6. The small grid squares colored red and green as illustrated in Figure 6 are of dimension l. The sampled grid block ABCD on which the sequence of operations T are applied is shown as shaded grey in Figure 6. The sequence of finite operations changes the arrangements of Betti numbers in the sampled grid block denoted as H in Figure 6. The grid squares which were not marked with Betti number β before the transformation T may now be marked or filled with Betti number β . This means to say that the position arrangements of Betti number β .\nWe now introduce the concept of symmetry as the amount of reshuffling happen because of the application of Transformation operation T . We have used the metric of Hamming distance Hx to capture the degree of reshuffling. We have moved away from the elementary concept of mirror symmetry and introduced the concept of Grid Symmetry. Our grid symmetry is with the respect to a particular feature of the data like distribution of holes, connected components etc. We have particularly used the topological features as it is more robust to noise. Our method is quite general and can be extended to other features of the data. To compute the Hamming distance, we have used the following notations\n1. Each small grid square at location i and j is marked as (i, j).\n2. |(i,j)| represents the occupation of the small grid square with the Betti number (β 6= 0) and is defined formally as,\n|(i, j)|=\n{\n1 if the grid square is occupied 0 if the grid square is not occupied\n3. The Hamming distance Hi, j computed along each row is given by\nHi, j = |(i, j)|⊕ |(i, j ′ )|,\nwhere the interchange of two consecutive columns T = T1 is given by π( j) = j ′ , and pasting the outermost column before the first T = T2 is given π(1) = j ′ for. π is the permutation operator. Here T1 and T2 are commutation and cyclic permutations as defined in the Section 2.\n4. The Hamming distance computed over the sampled grid block H(n) is given by,\nH(n) = n\n∑ i=1\n|(i, j)|⊕ |(i, j ′ )|, (4)\nwhere n is the grid number of the sampled block and ⊕ denotes the mod 2 operations.\nIntuitively the Hamming distance H(n) denotes the positional changes of the Betti number β after the finite sequence of operations. We now formally define the symmetric distribution of Betti numbers in our grid diagram context as the change positional changes of Betti number in small grid squares as shown Figure 5. The Figure 5 shows the Hamming distance after the applications of operations. The original grid block containing a particular configurations σ of Betti number β changes the number of positional distribution after the application of T2 as 12. So the hamming distance between the two configurations is\n12. After the operation of T2 again the Hamming distance decreases to 6, then after application of the operation T1 the hamming distance increases to 14 and lastly after the operation of T1 again the Hamming distance falls back to 6. The oscillating nature of Hamming distance H is upper bounded proved in our paper in the Section 4.\nDefinition (Symmetric Distribution). The probability distribution over Betti numbers β on a local grid block of size n is symmetric, if the Hamming distance Hi, j computed over the grid block (Equation (4)) is bounded by η after a finite sequence of operations T ,\nH(n)≤ η(n, l) (5)\nwhere η(n, l) is a integer parameter of choice and it depends on grid number of the sampled block and the grid parameter l.\nThe conditional probability Pr(H ≤ η) is computed as\nPr(H ≤ η) = Pr(σ |H ≤ η)Pr(σ) (6)\nFor the case of Cyclic Permutation operation, it is intuitive to see the local symmetry axis passing through the middle of the sampled grid block if the H(n) = 0. The value of H(n) gives us the sense of symmetry. More the value of H(n) less will be the symmetry of the sampled grid block. Next, we prove the upper bound of the Hamming distance H(n) is bounded.\nFor our proof of bounded upper bound of Hamming distance, we assume some known discrete distribution of Betti number β on the small grid square i.e the probability distribution fβ (i, j) of β on the grid square (i, j) follows some distributions. This approximation is valid as the real world\ndata lies in between truly random distribution and a probability distribution.\nTo simplify the notations, we denote x = {(i, j), l} and the probability density function fβ = fβ (x). From hence onward we also denote fβ (x) as f (x). Thus fβ (x) defines the probability that the grid square (i, j) will be occupied by β . Note that, fβ (x) is a multivariate function [Holtz, 2008; Garcke and Pfülger, 2014]. In the proof, we have used 2 dimensions as (1) position of the grid square (2) size of the small grid square l."

      "text" : "We formally propose a new Ising model of Data and compute the statistical distribution of the Betti numbers. Our modeling of data on a 2−D grid surface and digitization of Betti numbers are analogous to the spin configuration as in the Quantum Ising Model. We draw those parallels from the physical Ising model [Chakrabarti et al., 1996; Grimmett, 2010] and propose an analogous Data Ising Model. We then compute a probabilistic distribution of configurations Betti numbers on the grid. This allows us to find the symmetric distribution for the sampled grid after the finite sequence of operations of commutation, cyclic permutation and stabilization. We introduce the following notations.\nWe denote the 2−D planar grid G = (g,N), where g is the small grid square and N is the set of neighboring grid squares as shown in Figure 7. The small red square grid is surrounded by the set N of four green squares grid as shown in Figure 7. To each small square grid g ∈ G, we associate a number 1 or 0 analogous to quantum spin as in Quantum Ising Model with the local two-dimensional Hilbert space C2 [Grimmett, 2010; Chakrabarti et al., 1996]. We associate each small grid square g with 1 if the Betti number computed on it is not equal to 0, and leave the grid square g vacant(as in our model) or mark it with 0. This marking leaves us the planar grid as a block spin configuration. This allows us to write the configuration space for our planar grid as the tensor product of the grid states (1) and 0 as explained before.\nThe configuration space H for the planar 2−D planar grid is expressed as\nH = ⊗\ng∈G\nC (7)\nfor the local Hilbert space C. The eigenvectors for the Hilbert space C2 are e1 = ( 1 0 )T , e2 = ( 0 1 )T of the matrix σ (3)g = (\n1 0 0 −1\n)\nat the small grid site g,\nwith eigenvalues ±1. The other two matrices are σ (1)g = (\n1 0 0 −1\n) , σ (2)g = ( 1 0 0 −1 ) . We the propose the opera-\ntor H for our 2−D planar grid analogous to the Hamiltonian concept as\nH =− ∑ g1,g2∈G Jg1,g2σ (3) g1 σ (3) g2 −Γ ∑ g∈G σ1g (8)\nwhere g1 and g2 are neighboring small grid squares as shown in Figure 7.\nThe parameter Jg1,g2 is defined as the interaction strength between the small grid squares g1 and g2. The parameter Jg1,g2 is critically dependent on the boundaries ∂g1 ∂g2 and grid length l. The interaction parameter indicates the continuity of data manifold. The parameter Γ in our model denotes the rate of change hierarchical continuity of across the data manifold. The is hierarchical scaling variance parameter Γ(l) is a function of the dimension of small grid square l.\nThe probability for a configuration σ of Betti numbers in our 2−D planar grid G based on our data based Ising model is\nPG(σ) = 1\nZG e−τH(σ ) (9)\nwhere τ is a parameter. The normalization constant is for all possible configurations σ is given by\nZG = ∑e−τH(σ ) (10) The expected value for a function < f (σ) > of configurations is\n< f (σ) >= ∑ σ f (σ)PG(σ) (11)\nWe compute the expected value H(σ) of the number of using our proposed Data Ising Model\n< H(σ)>= ∑ σ H(σ)PG(σ) (12)\nRemark (Symmetric Distributions: Trivial Cases). Given a grid block, when either P(|(i, j)|) = 1 ∀i, j or P(|(i, j)|) = 0 ∀i, j, the Hamming distance is 0 after any sequence of legal grid moves.\nRemark (The Bernoulli Distribution of the Betti Numbers). Given a grid block of size n, when the distribution\nof the Betti numbers in each grid square independently follows the Bernoulli distribution with a parameter p, the expected Hamming Distance after a sequence of grid moves is 2n2 p(1− p).\nTheorem 3 (Bounded Hamming Distance between Symmetric Grid). When Commutation, Cyclic Permutation and Stabilization are allowed grid moves in a grid block, the statistical distribution measured by Hamming distance H(n) remains bounded after a sequence of grid moves.\nProof. Let Ω ⊆ R be a set and a d(= 2) dimensional product measure defined on Borel subsets of Ω2 using dimension-wise decomposition approximations as\nd(x) = ∏dµ j(x j) = dµ1(x1) ·dµ2(x2), (13) where x = (x1,x2) and µ j ( j = 1, · · · ,d) are probability measures on Borel subsets of Ω. Here x1 = (i, j), x2 = l\nLet V (2) is the Hilbert space of all functions. We define f (x) as a multivariate density function defined as\nf : Ω2 → [0,1]. (14)\nFor a subset u ⊆ D , where D = {1,2}, the measure µ induces projection functions Pu : V (2) →V (|u|) by\nPu f (xu) := ∫\nΩd−||u| f (x)dµD\\u(x) (15)\nHere xu denotes the |u|−dimensional vector and dµD\\u(x) := ∏ j/∈u dµ j(x j).\nFor u = /0 the projection function is given as\nP/0 f (x /0) = ∫\nΩ2 f (x)dµ(x) =: A (16)\nf ∈V (2) is then decomposed using dimension-wise decomposition and as\nf (x) = ∑ u⊆D fu(xu) (17)\nwith the orthogonality conditions\n( fu, fu) = 0, u 6= v (18)\nThe fu are computed recursively as\nfu(xu) = Pu f (xu)− ∑ v⊂u fv(xv) (19)\nUsing the classical ANOVA Decomposition and orthogonality condition we write the variance σ( f )2 as\nσ2( f ) = ∫\nΩd ( f (x)−A)2d(x)\n= ∑ u⊆D , u6= /0\nσ2( fu) (20)\nwhere σ2( fu) denotes the variance of fu.\nNow we compute the probability of Hamming distance H = m for a grid block consisting of n2 grid squares as\nPr[H] = Pr[ n\n∑ i=1\n|(i, j)|⊕ |(i, j ′ )|]\n≤ n\n∑ i=1\nPr[|(i, j)|⊕ |(i, j ′ )|]\n(21)\nNow for the case m > n2, Pr[H = m] = 0. To get the tighter upper bound we use the transformation of random variables and write as there exists a map g and g−11 as\nH = g1(X) (22)\nX = g−11 (H) (23)\nWe prove the the upper bound of Hamming distance after a finite sequence of Chebyshev’s inequality we write\nPr[H > kχ(σ)] = Pr[g1(X)> kχ(σ)]\n≤ 1 kκ(σ) (24)\nwhere χ(σ) and κ(σ) are functions that depend on the variance of f (x)\nWe have proposed a general Algorithm"

Our method of spatial distribution of Betti numbers on 2D grid can be encoded in constitutional neural network layers as the property of translation equivariance [Dieleman et al., 2016; Dieleman et al., 2015]. The method of data augmentation as described in [Dieleman et al., 2016] for the training of CNN’s fits particularly well with our approach, as\nthe random perturbations are well described the topological deformations. Our method throws light on the directions of studying the deep machine learning using scale invariants. We have connected our low dimensional topology models with Ising. Modeling invariances in deep learning particularly so in unsupervised learning is an active area of research[Srivastava et al., 2015]. The recent Google’s breakthrough cat neuron paper the authors uses the unshared weights to allow learning of more invariances other than translational invariances[Le et al., 2012]. Our modeling of topological invariances(Betti number) and priors in the data set naturally fits in the scheme. Further our Ising model parameter Γ(l) captures scaling of invariants asymptotically, as we decrease the dimension of the small grid square l."

    "abstractText" : "Finding interesting symmetrical topological structures in high-dimensional systems is an important problem in statistical machine learning. Limited amount of available high-dimensional data and its sensitivity to noise pose computational challenges to find symmetry. Our paper presents a new method to find local symmetries in a low-dimensional 2-D grid structure which is embedded in high-dimensional structure. To compute the symmetry in a grid structure, we introduce three legal grid moves (i) Commutation (ii) Cyclic Permutation (iii) Stabilization on sets of local grid squares, grid blocks. The three grid moves are legal transformations as they preserve the statistical distribution of hamming distances in each grid block. We propose and coin the term of grid symmetry of data on the 2-D data grid as the invariance of statistical distributions of hamming distance are preserved after a sequence of grid moves. We have computed and analyzed the grid symmetry of data on multivariate Gaussian distributions and Gamma distributions with noise.",
