{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Tree-Structured Variational Autoencoder", "abstract": "Many kinds of variable-sized data we would like to model contain an internal hierarchical structure in the form of a tree, including source code, formal logical statements, and natural language sentences with parse trees. For such data it is natural to consider a model with matching computational structure. In this work, we introduce a variational autoencoder-based generative model for tree-structured data. We evaluate our model on a synthetic dataset, and a dataset with applications to automated theorem proving. By learning a latent representation over trees, our model can achieve similar test log likelihood to a standard autoregressive decoder, but with the number of sequentially dependent computations proportional to the depth of the tree instead of the number of nodes in the tree.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper introduces a novel extension of the variational autoencoder to arbitrary tree-structured outputs.
