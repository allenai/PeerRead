      "text" : "Multimodal machine translation is the task of translating sentences in context, such as images paired with a parallel text (Specia et al., 2016). This is an emerging task in the area of multilingual multimodal natural language processing. Progress on this task may prove useful for translating the captions of the images illustrating online news articles, and for multilingual closed captioning in international television and cinema.\nInitial efforts have not convincingly demonstrated that visual context can improve translation quality. In the results of the First Multimodal Translation Shared Task, only three systems outperformed an off-the-shelf text-only phrase-based machine translation model, and the best performing system was equally effective with or without the visual features (Specia et al., 2016). There remains an open question about how translation models should take advantage of visual context.\nTranslation Decoder\nWe present a multitask learning model that decomposes multimodal translation into learning a translation model and learning visually grounded representations. This decomposition means that our model can be trained over external datasets of parallel text or described images, making it possible to take advantage of existing resources. Figure 1 presents an overview of our model, Imagination, in which source language representations are shared between tasks through the Shared Encoder. The translation decoder is an attention-based neural machine translation model (Bahdanau et al., 2015), and the image prediction decoder is trained to predict a global feature vector of an image that is associated with a sentence (Chrupała et al., 2015, IMAGINET). This decomposition encourages grounded learning in the shared encoder because the IMAGINET decoder is trained to imagine ar X iv :1\n70 5.\n04 35\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 M\nay 2\n01 7\nthe image associated with a sentence. It has been shown that grounded representations are qualitatively different from their text-only counterparts (Kádár et al., 2016) and correlate better with human similarity judgements (Chrupała et al., 2015). We assess the success of the grounded learning by evaluating the image prediction model on an image–sentence ranking task to determine if the shared representations are useful for image retrieval (Hodosh et al., 2013). In contrast with most previous work, our model does not take images as input at translation time, rather it learns grounded representations in the shared encoder.\nWe evaluate Imagination on the Multi30K dataset (Elliott et al., 2016) using a combination of in-domain and out-of-domain data. In the indomain experiments, we find that multitasking translation with image prediction improves over existing approaches. Our model achieves 55.8 Meteor as a single model trained on multimodal in-domain data, and 57.6 Meteor as an ensemble.\nIn the experiments with out-of-domain resources, we find that the improvement in translation quality holds when training the IMAGINET decoder on the MS COCO dataset of described images (Chen et al., 2015). Furthermore, if we significantly improve our text-only baseline using out-of-domain parallel text from the News Commentary corpus (Tiedemann, 2012), we still find improvements in translation quality from the auxiliary image prediction task. Finally, we report a state-of-the-art result of 59.3 Meteor on the Multi30K corpus when ensembling models trained on in- and out-of-domain resources.1"

      "heading" : "2 Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Multimodal translation is the task of producing target language translation y, given the source language sentence x and additional context, such as an image v. Concretely, let x be a source language sentence consisting N tokens: x1, x2, . . ., xn and let y be a target language sentence consisting M tokens: y1, y2, . . ., ym. The training data consists of tuplesD ∈ (x, y, v), where x is a description of image v, and y is a translation of x.\nMultimodal translation has previously been framed as minimising the negative log-likelihood of a translation model that is additionally conditioned on the image, i.e. J(θ) = − ∑\nj log p(yj |y<j , x, v). Here, we decompose 1The implementation will be available upon publication.\nthe problem into learning to translate and learning visually grounded representations. The decomposition is based on sharing parameters θ between these two tasks, and learning task-specific parameters φ. We learn the parameters in a multitask model with shared parameters in the source language encoder. The translation model has taskspecific parameters φt in the attention-based decoder, which are optimized through the translation loss JT (θ, φt). Grounded representations are learned through an image prediction model with task-specific parameters φg in the imageprediction decoder by minimizing JG(θ, φg). The joint objective is given by mixing the translation and image prediction tasks with the parameter w:\nJ(θ, φ) = wJT (θ, φ t) + (1− w)JG(θ, φg) (1)\nOur decomposition of the problem makes it straightforward to optimise this objective without paired tuples, e.g. where we have an external dataset of described images Dimage ∈ (x, v) or an external parallel corpus Dtext ∈ (x, y).\nWe train our multitask model following the approach of Luong et al. (2016). We define a primary task and an auxiliary task, and a set of parameters θ to be shared between the tasks. A minibatch of updates is performed for the primary task with probabilityw, and for the auxiliary task with 1−w. The primary task is trained until convergence and weight w determines the frequency of parameter updates for the auxiliary task."

When we perform experiments with the News Commentary corpus, we first calculate a 17,597 sub-word vocabulary using SentencePiece (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012) over the concatentation of the Multi30K and News Commentary datasets.

(2016) uses visual features in a target-side retrieval model for translation. Toyama et al. (2016) is most comparable to our approach: it is a multimodal variational NMT model that infers latent variables to represent the source language semantics from the image and linguistic data.\nTable 2 shows the results of this experiment. We can see that the combination of the attentionbased translation model and the image prediction model is a 1.8 Meteor point improvement over the NMT baseline, but it is 1.1 Meteor points worse than the strong Moses baseline. Our approach is competitive with previous approaches that use visual features as inputs to the decoder and the target-side reranking model. It also outperforms Toyama et al.

We do not see an additive improvement for the multitasking model with the concatenated parallel text and the indomain data (+ Imagination) using a training objective interpolation of w = 0.89 (the ratio of the training dataset sizes). This may be because we are essentially learning a translation model and the updates from the IMAGINET decoder are forgotten. Therefore, we experiment with multitasking the concatenated parallel text and the COCO dataset (w = 0.5). We find that balancing the datasets improves over the concatenated text model by 0.4 Meteor (+ Imagination (COCO)). Our multitasking approach improves upon Calixto et al. by 0.3 Meteor points.

Both models neglect to translate the word “dangling”, which is a low-frequency word in the training data.

It has previously been shown that the choice of visual features can affect the performance of vision and language models (Jabri et al., 2016; Kiela et al., 2016). We compare the effect of training the IMAGINET decoder to predict different types of image features, namely: 4096D features extracted from the ‘fc7‘’\nlayer of the VGG-19 model (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015), 2048D features extracted from the ‘pool5/7x7 s1’ layer of InceptionNet V3 (Szegedy et al., 2015), and 2048D features extracted from ‘avg pool‘ layer of ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016). Table 7 shows the results of this experiment. There is a clear difference between predicting the 2048D vectors (Inception-V3 and ResNet-50) compared to the 4096D vector from VGG-19). This difference is reflected in both the translation Meteor score and the Median rank of the images in the validation dataset. This is likely because it is easier to learn the parameters of the image prediction model that has fewer parameters (8.192 million for VGG19 vs. 4.096 million for Inception-V3 and ResNet50). However, it is not clear why there is such a pronounced difference between the Inception-V3 and ResNet-50 models5. Further work is needed to understand the difference in these results."

      "text" : "Initial work on multimodal translation has focused on approaches that use either semantic or spatially-preserving image features as inputs to a translation model. Semantic image features are typically extracted from the final pooling layer of a pre-trained object recognition CNN, e.g. ‘pool5/7x7 s1’ in GoogLeNet (Szegedy et al., 2015). This type of feature vector has been used conditioning input to the encoder (Elliott et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016), in the decoder (Libovický et al., 2016), or as additional features in a\n5We used the pre-trained models from Keras (Chollet, 2015) downloaded from https://github.com/ fchollet/deep-learning-models, which claim equal ILSVRC object recognition performance for both models: 7.8% top-5 error with a single-model and single-crop.\nphrase-based translation model (Shah et al., 2016; Hitschler et al., 2016). Spatially-preserving image features are extracted from deeper inside a CNN, where the position of a feature in the tensor is related to its position in the image. These features have been used in “double-attention models”, which calculate independent context vectors of the source language hidden states and a convolutional image feature map (Calixto et al., 2016; Caglayan et al., 2016; Calixto et al., 2017a). Similar to most of these approaches, we use an attention-based translation model, but our multitask model does not use images for translation.\nMore related to our work are the recent papers by Toyama et al. (2016), Saha et al. (2016), and Nakayama and Nishida (2016). Toyama et al. (2016) extend the Variational Neural Machine Translation model (Zhang et al., 2016) by inferring latent variables to explicitly model the semantics of source sentences from both image and linguistic information. Similar to our approach, their model does not condition the translation model on images for translation. They report improvements on the Multi30K data set when using multimodal information, however, their model adds additional parameters in the form of “neural inferrer” modules. In our multitask model, the grounded semantics are represented implicitly in the hidden states of the shared encoder. Furthermore, Toyama et al. (2016) assumes Source-Target-Image tuples as training data; whereas our multitask framework achieves equally good results if we train on separate Source-Image and Source-Target datasets.\nSaha et al. (2016) study the problem of crosslingual image description where the task is to generate sentence in language L1 given the image, given only Image-L2 and L1-L2 parallel corpora. They propose a Correlational Encoder-Decoder Network to model the Image-L2 and L1-L2 parallel text data. Their model learns correlated representations for paired Image-L2 data and decodes L1 from this joint representation. Similarly to our setup the encoder is trained by minimizing two loss functions: the Image-L2 correlation loss, and the L1 decoding cross-entropy loss.\nNakayama and Nishida (2016) consider a zeroresource problem where the task is to translate from L1 to L2 but only Image-L1 and ImageL2 corpora are available. Their best performing model embeds the image, L1, and L2 in a joint multimodal space learned through minimizing a\nmulti-task ranking loss between both pairs of examples. The main difference between this approach and our models is that in our experiments we focus on enriching source language representations with visual information, rather than addressing the zero-resource issue.\nMultitask Learning improves the generalisability of a model by requiring it to be useful for more than one task (Caruana, 1997). This approach has seen a surge of attention and has recently been used to improve the performance of sentence compression using eye gaze as an auxiliary task (Klerke et al., 2016), and to improve shallow parsing accuracy through the auxiliary task of predicting keystrokes in an out-of-domain corpus (Plank, 2016). These works hypothesise a relationship between specific biometric measurements and specific NLP tasks motivated by cognitive-linguistic theories. More recently, Bingel and Søgaard (2017) analysed the beneficial relationships between primary and auxiliary sequential prediction tasks. In our multitask framework we explore the benefits of the general notion of grounded learning in the specific case of multimodal translation. In the translation literature, multitask learning has been used to learn a oneto-many languages translation model (Dong et al., 2015), and as a subtask of multitask sequence-tosequence learning (Luong et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "We decompose multimodal translation into two sub-problems: learning to translate and learning visually grounded representations. In a multitask learning framework, we show how these subproblems can be addressed by sharing an encoder between a translation model and an image prediction model. Our approach achieves state-of-theart results on the Multi30K dataset without using images for translation. We show that training on separate parallel text and described image datasets does not hurt performance, encouraging future research on multitasking with diverse sources of data. Furthermore, we still find improvements from image prediction when we improve our textonly baseline with the out-of-domain parallel text. Future work includes adapting our decomposition to other NLP tasks that may benefit from out-ofdomain resources, such as semantic role labelling, dependency parsing, and question-answering; exploring methods for inputting the (predicted) im-\nage into the translation model; experimenting with different image prediction architectures; multitasking different translation languages into a single shared encoder; and multitasking in both the encoder and decoder(s)."
