      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "A major goal of computational linguistics research is to enable organic, language-mediated interaction between humans and artificial agents. In a common scenario of such interaction, a human issues a command in the imperative mood—e.g. Put that there or Pick up the box—and a robot acts in turn (Bolt, 1980; Tellex et al., 2011; Walter et al., 2015). While this utterance-action paradigm presents its own set of challenges (Tellex et al., 2012), it greatly simplifies the diversity of ways in which natural language can be used to elicit action of an agent, be it human or artificial (Clark, 1996; Portner, 2007; Kaufmann and Schwager, 2009; Condoravdi and Lauer, 2012; Kaufmann, 2016). Most clause types, even vanilla declaratives, instantiate as performative requests in certain contexts (Austin, 1975; Searle, 1989; Perrault and Allen, 1980).\nIn this work, we employ machine learning to study the use of performative commands in the Cards corpus, a set of transcripts from a web-based game that is designed to elicit a high degree of linguistic and strategic collaboration (Djalali et al., 2011, 2012; Potts, 2012). For example, players are tasked with navigating a maze-like gameboard in search of six cards of the same suit, but since a player can hold at most three cards at a time, they must coordinate their efforts to win the game.\nWe focus on a subclass of performative commands that are ubiquitous in the Cards corpus: Nonagentive declaratives about the locations of objects, e.g. “The five of hearts is in the top left corner,” hereafter referred to as locatives. Despite that their semantics makes no reference to either an agent or an action—thus distinguishing them from conventional imperatives (Condoravdi and Lauer, 2012)— locatives can be interpreted as commands when embedded in particular discourse contexts. In the Cards game, it is frequently the case that an addressee will respond to such an utterance by fetching the card mentioned.\nFollowing work on the context-driven interpretation of declaratives as questions (Beun, 2000), we hypothesize that the illocutionary effect of a locative utterance is a function of contextual features that variably constrain the actions of discourse participants. To test this idea, we identify a set of 94 locative utterances in the Cards transcripts that we deem to be truly ambiguous, out of context, between\n∗ Authors contributed equally\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n03 45\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nS ep\n2 01\n7\ninformative and command readings. We then annotate their respective transcripts for a simplified representation of the tabular common ground model of Malamud and Stephenson (2015). Here, we identify the common ground with the state of a game as reflected by the utterances made by both players up to a specific point in time. Finally, we train machine learning classifiers on features of the common ground to predict whether or not the addressee will act in response to the utterance in question. Through these experiments we discover a few very powerful contextual features that predict when a locative utterance will be interpreted as a command."

      "text" : "The subject of indirect commands, of which the locative utterances we study are an example, has been extensively analyzed in terms of speech act and decision theory (Austin, 1975; Clark, 1979; Perrault and Allen, 1980; Allen and Perrault, 1980; Searle, 1989). In Portner’s (2007) formal model, imperatives are utterances whose conventional effect updates an abstract “to-do list” of an addressee. More recent debate has asked whether this effect is in fact built into the semantics of imperatives, or if their directive force is resolved by pragmatic reasoning in context (Condoravdi and Lauer, 2012; Kaufmann, 2016).\nThe present work synthesizes these intuitions from the theory of commands with recent computational work on natural language pragmatics (Vogel et al., 2013, 2014; Degen et al., 2013) and collaborative dialogue (Chai et al., 2014). We are particularly influenced by previous work demonstrating the complexity of pragmatic phenomena in the Cards corpus (Djalali et al., 2011, 2012; Potts, 2012)."

      "heading" : "3 The Cards corpus",
      "text" : "The Cards corpus is a set of 1,266 transcripts from a two-player, collaborative, web-based game. The Cards corpus is well-suited to studying the pragmatics of commands because it records both utterances made as well as the actions taken during the course of a game.\nAt the start of the game, player locations are randomly initialized on a two-dimensional, grid-style game board. Cards from a conventional 52-card deck are scattered randomly throughout the board. Players are prompted with the following task:\nGather six consecutive cards of a particular suit (decide which suit together), or determine that this is impossible. Each of you can hold only three cards at a time, so youll have to coordinate your efforts. You can talk all you want, but you can make only a limited number of moves.\nIn addition to the fact that players can only hold three cards at a time, the game is further-constrained in ways that stimulate highly collaborative talk. In particular, while players can see their own location, they cannot see the locations of their partners and so must inquire about them. Players can only see cards within a small neighborhood around their respective locations, and so must explore the board to find relevant cards. Moreover, while some walls are visible, others are invisible and so lead to surprise perturbations in the course of exploring the gameboard."

      "heading" : "4 Command types in the Cards Corpus",
      "text" : "Commands in the Cards corpus can be coarsely divided into ones which make reference to an action with a second person agent, and those which do not.\nThe first of these categories is comprised of imperatives and a variety so-called performative commands: Utterances which act as commands in context but whose clause type is not conventionally associated with the effect of commanding (Clark, 1979; Searle, 1989; Wierzbicka, 1991). For example, with respect to picking up cards:\npick it up! pick up the 9 or hell, grab the 234 of D ok when you get here pick up the 8H i think you should pick up the 3h, 5h, and 8h so if you can find 5S,6S,7S that would be great\nWith respect to dropping (or not dropping) cards:\ndrop the 2 keepp the 3 no dont drop it.) ok drop the 7 i guess get rid of 6d. i found 7h so if you come and drop the 8h and pick up the 6h we are good\nWith respect to conversational actions (some of these utterances are shortened for clarity):\ntell me where it is talk to me dude [...] tell me if you see 5 or 6 don’t just say “a lot of cards” [...] awesome let me know once you have it.\nImperatives and performatives that mention agents contrast with the lesser understood subclass of performative commands that are the focus of this work. Utterances like “The five of hearts is in the top corner” do not even encode an action with respect to the object mentioned, let alone an agent, but can nevertheless be used to elicit action of an addressee in certain contexts.\nAs a motivating example, consider the following exchange between two players describing their respective hands:\nP1: 3h, 4h and ks P2: i have a queen of diamonds and ace of club P2: we have a mess lol\nDespite Player 2’s concerns, a strategy emerges shortly thereafter when Player 1 finds an additional hearts card:\nP1: i have 3h,4h,6h P2: ok so we need to collect hearts then\nAt this point in the transcript, all that has been committed to the common ground is that Player 1 has a full hand of three proximal hearts cards that could be relevant to a winning strategy, and Player 2 has two non-hearts cards. This is the very next utterance in the exchange:\nP1: there is a 5h in the very top left corner\nPlayer 2 is seen immediately hereafter to navigate to the top left corner, pick up the five of hearts, and confirm:\nP2: ok i got it :)\nIn this exchange, Player 2 appears to understand not only that the five of hearts is relevant to the winning strategy of six consecutive hearts, but also that it makes more sense for her to act on information about its location than it does for Player 1 to do so.\nThis discourse encapsulates the collaborative reasoning pattern described by Perrault and Allen (1980). The speaker assumes that the addressee is a cooperative agent. Thus, the addressee shares in the goal of attaining a winning game state and will act in a way so as to realize that goal. Recognizing the fact that the speaker would have to drop cards relevant to the goal to pick up the card at issue, a cooperative addressee will infer that she should act by picking it up instead. In this way, locative utterances can be indirectly used as commands.\nThe distribution of command types for a subset of actions (pickup, drop, conversation, and search) is displayed in Figure 1. As depicted, for the majority of actions compelled by a speaker and taken by an addressee, the imperative is the predominant command strategy, followed by non-locative performatives. However locative commands appear to be the dominant strategy for eliciting card pickups in the corpus, constituting nearly half of all such commands observed.\nThis pattern demonstrates that for certain kinds of actions, it is quite natural to use the least direct, most context-dependent command strategy to elicit action of an addressee."

      "text" : "We seek to understand how the discourse context of a game can influence the interpretation of locative utterances as commands. We therefore construct a binary classification task whereby we test how the role of a locative utterance can be resolved in context, evidenced by the actions that are taken as follow-ups to the utterance. In our task, one label denotes addressee follow-up in the form of acting to pick up the card in question, signaling her intention to act, or asking a clarifying question about its whereabouts. The second label denotes that either the speaker acts on their own utterance or neither agent does."

      "text" : "Our aim in devising this task is to investigate connection between common ground knowledge and the illocutionary effects of locative utterances. We therefore train a standard logistic regression classifier and experiment with a few carefully designed features that encode constraints on player action, and which should hypothetically trigger the interpretation of locative utterances as indirect commands. We experiment with the following features:\nModel F1 Random 23.5 Bigram 58.9 Edit Distance 62.5 Explicit Goal 76.2 Full Hand 82.3 Explicit Goal + Full Hand 77.7\nSingle-feature classifiers are compared against a number of baselines to help benchmark our predictive task. Our first baseline, which is context-agnostic, seeks to capture the intuition that the role of a locative utterance is entirely ambiguous when considered in isolation. This baseline predicts the agent follow-up using a Bernoulli distribution weighted according to the class priors of the training data.\nThe second baseline incorporates surface-level dialogue context via bigram features of all the utterance exchanged between players up to and including the locative utterance. We also experimented with a unigram baseline but found that its performance was inferior to that of the bigram."
    }, {
      "heading" : "5.3 Results",
      "text" : "We test our common-ground features one at a time with our logistic regression model, as we are interested in seeing how successfully they encode agents’ pragmatic inferences. We also combine the two bestperforming common-ground features. We report the results of our experiments using an F1 measure and a 0.8/0.2 train/test split of our data in Table 1.\nWe see that of our two baselines, the bigram model performs better. This bigram model also uses 2,916 distinct lexical features which makes it a highly overspecified model for our moderate data size.\nWe find that our single-feature context-sensitive models both significantly outperform our baselines. Our Explicit Goal feature outperforms the Edit Distance feature by about 14%, which indicates that locative utterances are often interpreted as commands in the presence of an explicit, common goal. The Full Hands feature outperforms the Explicit Goal feature by about 6%. This strongly suggests that constraints on speaker action play a role in determining the illocutionary effect of a locative utterance. An addressee\nof such an utterance will tend to act accordingly when their partner cannot pick up the card mentioned, and when the card in question brings them closer to winning the game. We find that combining the Explicit Goal and Full Hands features improved performance over only using the Explicit Goal feature but reduced overall performance. This could be because the two features encode some common information about the agents’ pragmatic implicatures during the game, and hence their correlative effects tend to degrade the combined model performance."

      "text" : "In this work, we have performed an extensive study of command types as present in the Cards corpus. Using the corpus as a test bed for grounded natural language interaction among agents with a shared goal, we describe a variety of utterances that may function as indirect commands when regarded in context. In particular, locative utterances, which are not conventionally associated with command interpretations, are shown to operate as commands when considered in relation to situational constraints in the course of collaborative interaction. We develop a predictive task to show that models with carefully-designed features incorporating game state information can help agents effectively perform such pragmatic inferences."

However, to progress toward more natural exchanges between humans and these assistants, it is important to understand the way non-imperative utterances can indirectly elicit action of an addressee. In this paper, we investigate command types in the setting of a grounded, collaborative game. We focus on a less understood family of utterances for eliciting agent action, locatives like The chair is in the other room, and demonstrate how these utterances indirectly command in specific game state contexts. Our work shows that models with domain-specific grounding can effectively realize the pragmatic reasoning that is necessary for more robust natural language interaction.",
