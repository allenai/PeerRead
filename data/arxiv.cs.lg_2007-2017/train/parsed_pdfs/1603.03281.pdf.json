INTRODUCTION Medical records preprocessing is an important step which cannot be avoided in most of the situations and when handling medical datasets. The attributes present in medical records may be of different data types. Also, the values of attributes have certain domain which requires proper knowledge from medical domain to handle them.\nThis is because of this diverse nature of medical records, handling medical records is quite challenging for data miners and researchers. The various preprocessing techniques for medical records include fixing outliers in medical data, estimation and imputing missing values, normalizing medical attributes, handling inconsistent medical data, applying smoothing techniques to attributes values of medical records to specify some of them.\nData Quality depends on Data Preprocessing techniques. An efficient preprocessing of medical records may increase the data quality of medical records. In this context, data preprocessing techniques have achieved significant importance from medical data analysts and data miners. Incorrect and improper data values may mislead the prediction and classification results, there by resulting in false classification\nresults and thus leading to improper medical treatment which is a very dangerous potential hazard. This research mainly aims at handling missing attribute values present in medical records of a dataset. The attributes may be numeric, categorical etc. The present method can handle all the attribute types without the need to devise a different method to handle different attribute types. This is first importance of our approach. We outline research objective and problem specification in the succeeding lines of this paper and then discuss importance of our approach."

RELATED WORKS Most of the research works carried in the literature argues that the presence of missing values of medical attributes makes the extra overhead may be in prediction and classification or when performing dataset analysis. In contrast to this the researchers Zhang, S et.al in their work [1] discuss and argue that missing values are useful in cost sensitive environments [17-18]. This is because some of the attributes values incur high cost to fill those values by carrying experiments. In such cases, it would be cost effective to skip such tests and values associated with those medical tests. Handling Missing values in medical datasets is quite challenging and also requires use of statistical approaches [15, 16] to estimate the same. In [2], missing values are found by using clustering approach where the missing value is filled with the value of attribute of nearest clusters. The concept of support vector regression and clustering is applied to find missing values in the work of authors [3]. In [4], phylogeny problems occurring because of missing values is discussed. An approach to handle medical datasets consisting mixed attribute types is handled in [5]. Some of the research contributions in missing values include [6-21].\nIII.

IMPUTATION FRAME WORK In this section, we discuss framework to impute missing\nvalues as shown in Fig.2 and Fig.3\nThe framework for missing value Imputation consists of following steps. The approach for missing values is based on the concept of clustering medical records without missing values. This is because, all similar medical records shall come into one cluster and hence imputation performed shall be more accurate. This approach of finding missing values has not been carried out earlier in the literature. We present analytical framework with a case study in this paper. This research was motivated form the work by researchers for intrusion detection published in 2015 [20]."

Find records with and without missing values. Classify records in to two groups, say G1 and G2. The first group, G1 is set of all medical records with no missing values given by Eq.1. The second group, G2 is set of all medical records having missing values given by Eq.2.\n       |     ,   ,  } (1)\n=      |     /    ,   (2)\nWhere     1, and     1, .We may consider group,  as training set of medical records while group, is considered as testing set in this case. \nStep-2: Cluster Medical Records with No Missing values\nLet, g = |Dd |, be the number of decision classes. Determine the maximum number of decision classes available in the medical dataset being considered. Cluster the medical records in group,  to a number of clusters equal to g. i.e |Dd|.\nThis may be achieved using K-means clustering algorithm. This is because K-means algorithm requires the number of required clusters to be specified well ahead before clustering process is carried out. The output of step-2 is a set of clusters. i.e Number of output clusters is equal to‘g’.\nThis is shown in fig.4 and fig.5 where a set of medical records represented by are clustered in to ‘d’ clusters.\nStep-3: Obtain Cluster Center for each Cluster formed\nThis step involves finding the cluster center for each cluster which is generated using the k-means clustering algorithm. We can obtain the cluster center by finding the mean of each attribute from attribute set, of medical attributes.\nLet Cluster- Cd denotes dth cluster having the records R1, R6, R8 and R9 with single attribute. Then the cluster center is given by Eq.3 as\nµ = R A    R A    R A    R A (3)\nIn general the cluster center of gth cluster may be obtained using the generalized equation, Eq.4 given below\n  µg U   ∑ R | l    1, q  for each k    1, n  \n|l|        4\nis hence a sequence of ‘n’ values indicating cluster center over ‘n’ attributes. The notation, is used to denote set of all values each separated by a symbol comma. The cluster center may hence be formally represented using the representation given by Eq.5\nµ     µ , µ , µ , µ , …… . µ   (5) Here ‘n’ indicates total number of attributes in each\nmedical record and |g| indicates number of clusters.\nStep-4: Compute distance between each  and each Find distance from each medical record, in group, to each of the cluster centers, obtained in step-3. This can be achieved through finding the Euclidean distance between each medical record of ‘n’ attributes and cluster center of each\n26 https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\ncluster defined over ‘n’ attributes. These cluster distances computed are summed to obtain a single distance value. This distance is called Type-1 distance value given by Eq. 6.\nDist  ,  =\n    μ     μ       μ      6  \n      1, ,\nAt the end of Step-4 we have distance value from each record , to each cluster center denoted by .\nStep-5: Transform multi-dimensional medical record to a single dimension numeric value by using mapping function\n  is a mapping function which maps the medical record, to a single distance value. To determine mapping function value of a record we use the equation, Eq.7\nThis can be obtained by adding all distances obtained in Step-4\n    ∑ ∑Dist  ,  | |                1, (7)\nWhere |g| is number of clusters formed, (n-h) indicates number of records in group, G1.\nAt the end of step-5, we have each medical record,  mapped to a single dimension distance value. In other words, the medical record of ‘n’ dimensions is reduced to single dimension achieving dimensionality reduction.\nStep-6: Compute distance between each  in group, and each of clusters formed\nObtain distance value of missing records to these cluster centers by discarding the attributes with missing values. Find distance from each medical record, in group, to each of the cluster centers, obtained in step-3.\nThis can be achieved through finding the Euclidean distance between each medical record of ‘n’ attributes and cluster center of each cluster defined over ‘n’ attributes. These cluster distances computed are summed to obtain a single distance value. This distance is called Type-2 distance value given by Eq.8.\nDist2 (  , )\n= ∑     μ ……… .     (8)\ndiscarding the yth missing attribute value.\nStep-7: Transform multi-dimensional medical record with missing values to a single dimension by using mapping function\n  is a mapping function which maps each medical record, consisting to a single distance value. To determine mapping function value of a record  , we use the equation, Eq.9\n  ∑ ∑Dist  ,  | |                1, (9)\nWhere |g| is number of clusters formed and 1,\nAt the end of step-7, we have each medical record,  mapped to a single dimension distance value. In other words, the medical record of ‘n’ dimensions is reduced to single dimension achieving dimensionality reduction.\nStep-8: Obtain difference between distances obtained in step-6 and step-8\nFor each missing record, in ,  obtain difference between mapping functions of each record,  in group,  and missing record, in group, . Call this value as  \nStep-9: Find nearest record\nThe medical record is most similar to the medical record, whose corresponding is most minimum as given by Eq.10.\n                (10)\nStep-10: Fix Missing values and Impute Missing Values\nThe medical record is most similar to the record, whose corresponding is most minimum. In this case, impute the missing attribute value of record, denoted by\n  by the attribute value,  of medical record denoted as .\nIncase more than one record with same minimum value is obtained then, fill the missing value of the attribute with the attribute value whose frequency is maximum from the same decision class. Alternately, we may fix the mean of the values also from the corresponding decision class attribute values.\nVI. CASE STUDY In this Section-VI, we discuss case study to find missing attributes values of medical records by using the proposed approach. For this, we consider a sample dataset consisting sample values.\nConsider Table. I, shown below consisting of sample dataset of medical records having categorical and numerical values. Table. II shows medical records without missing values after normalizing sample dataset. Table.III denotes records with and without missing values. Table IV denotes all records without missing values and Table. V shows records with missing attribute values.\nTable.VI depicts clusters generated from group G1 , which consists medical records with no missing values after applying k-means algorithm. There are two clusters generated C1 and C2.\nC1 contains set of all medical records {R1,R4,R6,R9} and C2 contains set of all medical records {R2, R7, R8 }. Table.VII gives the distances of records in group, G1 to cluster center of the first cluster. Similarly, Table.VIII gives the distances of records in group, G2 to cluster center of the second cluster.\nTable.IX depicts computation values of mapping function of records of group, G1. The mapping function is mapping distance of ith record, which is sum of all distances from record, to each of those cluster centers generated from application of clustering algorithm.\n27 https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nTable. X gives the distances of medical records in group, G2 to each of the cluster centers.\nTable. XI depicts computation values of mapping function of medical records containing missing values of group, G2. The mapping function  is mapping distance of jth record, which is sum of all distances from record, to each of those cluster centers generated from application of clustering algorithm. The distance is computed considering those attributes which do not have missing values. i.e Attribute values are defined and recorded.\nTable.XII shows distance of record, R3 to records R1, R2, R4, R6, R7, R8, R9 . The record R3 is nearest to medical record R8. The Table. XIII shows nearest medical record R8 for R3 which is ideal record to carry imputation. The attribute value to be imputed is 2. i.e the categorical attribute value d32. This is because the attribute value, d32 was mapped to numerical value 2.\nTable.XIV shows distance of record, R5 to records R1, R2, R4, R6, R7, R8, R9 . The record R5 is nearest to medical record R8. The Table. XV shows nearest medical record R8 for R5 which is ideal record to carry imputation. The attribute value to be imputed is 7. i.e the numerical value.\nFinally in this case study, we fill the missing values of medical records by imputing the missing attribute values. Since, attribute values after imputing, happen to be the same values which were present initially in Table.1 the correctness of the approach can be verified and validated. The proposed approach of finding imputation values is hence accurate and also efficient as it also aims at dimensionality reduction of medical records and then estimates missing values. In the process of dimensionality reduction we never miss any attribute values or attributes. This brings the accuracy in the present approach.\nThis approach may be extended to classify new medical record without class label to an appropriate class, if required by simply assigning class label of medical record to which the\nnew record distance minimum. In this way, disease prediction or classification may be achieved.\nVII. CLASSIFICATION OF NEW MEDICAL RECORDS Consider the table of medical records with class labels as in Table.XVI with the parameter values same as Table. II, the last column is decision class, which predicts the disease level or stage. This table is free from missing values and hence is suitable for mining medical records.\nAssume that, we have an incoming medical record with the attribute values as R10 = [2, 5, 2, 9]. We can obtain Euclidean distances from record R10 to all the records R1 through R9. The class of the record is the class of medical record to which the Euclidean distance is minimum. Table. XVII gives distance of medical record R10 to all records.\nUsing this approach we get two class labels as the record is nearest to both records R4 and R8. But the classes are class-1 and classs-2 for R4 and R8 respectively. So we can’t categorize the disease correctly or accurately. This is because; we did not perform dimensionality reduction. This is overcome if we extend the approach for fixing missing values to classification also. The only difference is that we continue to extend the procedure outlined in Section –IV, to all the records after fixing missing values (R1 to R9) and adopt the procedure for missing record to the new record but considering all attribute values. This is shown in computations below. Table. XVIII shows clusters generated using k-means with K=2. Table.XIX and Table.XX shows distance of records R1 to R9 w.r.t cluster centers. Table XXI and Table XXIII shows mapping distance of R1 to R9 and Record R10 respectively.\n29 https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nTable.XXII gives distance value of new records R10 to clusters formed. Table. XXIV gives difference of mapping values of existing records and new record.\nTABLE XXII. DISTANCES OF NEW MEDICAL RECORD TO CLUSTERS\nTABLE XXIII. MAPPING DISTANCE OF R10\nThe class label of record R10 to be assigned is the class label of the record to which the distance is minimum in Table.XXIV. In this case, the distance of R10 is proved to be minimum w.r.t R8 as compared to other record distances. Hence the class label of the new record R10 is class label of record R8. i.e Class-2 or Level-2. Hence, the category of disease level of person whose medical record values are defined by R10 is level-2 or class-2 or Type-2 disease.\nVIII. ADVANTAGE OF PROPOSED METHOD If we can see the result obtained with traditional approach without dimensionality reduction carried out, the category of disease is either Class-1 or Class-2. This is because of noise attribute values. We overcome such a disadvantage using the proposed method of dimensionality reduction and classification. Using this proposed method, we get a single class label for the new record. In our case, the class is identified as Class-2 or Level-2 using proposed method of classification. This is because of dimensionality reduction performed to single value without missing any attribute or neglecting any attribute value.\nIX. DISCUSSIONS AND OUTCOMES In this research, we address the first challenge of handling medical records in datasets. We discuss the approach for imputing missing attribute values of medical records. This is done by clustering medical records which were free from missing values. The records with missing values were separate from dataset. The multi-dimensional medical records are transformed to single dimension. In future, the objective is to see the possibility of other clustering procedures and new approaches to impute missing values. The present approach may be extended to perform classification and prediction without the need for adopting separate procedures to achieve the required objectives. This method is first of its kind which may be used to perform missing values imputation, classification, and disease prediction in a single stretch. A simple common sense shows the importance of the approach carried out and may be extended to any other domain of interest by researchers.\nRecord Distance to Cluster-1 Distance to Cluster-2\nR10 1.785357 3.628027\nRecord Mapping Distance R10 5.053384\n30 https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nX. CONCLUSIONS AND SCOPE FOR FUTURE RESEARCH In the present research, we address the first challenge of handling missing values in medical datasets. We also address how the dimensionality reduction of medical datasets may be achieved in a simple approach. We come up with a new approach of finding missing values in datasets not addressed in the literature by aiming at a single dimension. The approach followed does not miss any attribute information while carrying out dimensionality reduction which is the importance of this approach. The proposed approach of imputing missing values in medical records is feasible for both categorical and numerical attributes as discussed in case study. However, suitable normalization techniques must be applied, if required for some datasets after extensive study of the datasets. In this paper, we also extend imputation approach also for prediction and classification of unknown medical records for predicting disease levels or symptoms through soft computing techniques. The approach overcomes ambiguity which is otherwise possible if dimensionality reduction is not carried properly."

    "abstractText" : "Imputation of missing attribute values in medical datasets for extracting hidden knowledge from medical datasets is an interesting research topic of interest which is very challenging. One cannot eliminate missing values in medical records. The reason may be because some tests may not been conducted as they are cost effective, values missed when conducting clinical trials, values may not have been recorded to name some of the reasons. Data mining researchers have been proposing various approaches to find and impute missing values to increase classification accuracies so that disease may be predicted accurately. In this paper, we propose a novel imputation approach for imputation of missing values and performing classification after fixing missing values. The approach is based on clustering concept and aims at dimensionality reduction of the records. The case study discussed shows that missing values can be fixed and imputed efficiently by achieving dimensionality reduction. The importance of proposed approach for classification is visible in the case study which assigns single class label in contrary to multi-label assignment if dimensionality reduction is not performed.
