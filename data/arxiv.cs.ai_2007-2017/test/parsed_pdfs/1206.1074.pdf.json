INTRODUCTION\nA large-scale global optimization problem is defined as follows. Let us assume, an objective function f(x) is given, where x = (x1, . . . , xD) is a vector of D design variables in a decision space S. The design variables xi ∈ {xlb, xub} are limited by their lower xlb ∈ R and upper bounds xub ∈ R. The task of optimization is to find the minimum of the objective function. Note that large-scale refers to a huge number of variables, i.e. n ≥ 1, 000. Moreover, this problem belongs to the domain of function optimization.\nThe domain of function optimization serves as a ’test-bed’ for many new comparisons and new features of various algorithms [25]. Over the past decade, different kinds of metaheuristic optimization algorithms [17, 26] have been developed for solving this problem, for example: Simulated Annealing (SA) [21, 32], Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) [2, 3, 8, 23], Differential Evolution (DE) [5, 6, 10, 34], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [7, 13] and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [11, 12]. EAs hybridized with local search algorithms [1] have been successful within this domain. These kinds of EAs are often named as memetic algorithms (MAs) [24, 27]. Memetic computation (MC) [33] has emerged recently as a widening of MAs. MC uses a composition of memes that represent those units of information encoded within complex structures and interact with each other for the purpose of problemsolving. Namely, the meme denotes an abstract concept that can be, for example: a strategy, an operator or a local search algorithm.\nAs analog to EA, swarm intelligence (SI) [4] has been inspired by nature. For foraging and defending, it simulates the collective behavior of social insects, flock of birds, ant-colonies, and fish schools. These particles are looking for good food sources and due to the interaction between them move to the more promising regions within an environment. This concept has been exploited also by the Artificial Bees Colony (ABC) algorithm proposed by Karaboga and Basturk [19] and achieved excellent results when solving continuous optimization problems [20] as well as combinatorial optimization problems [15, 37].\nArtificial bees form colonies within which each bee has limited capabilities and limited knowledge of its environment. However, such a colony is capable of developing a collective intelligence that is used for foraging. The foraging process is divided into three components: food sources, employed foragers, and unemployed foragers. On the other hand, Iacca et al. [18] assert that an optimal memetic exploration of the search space is composed of three\nmemes: the first stochastic with long-search radius, the second stochastic with a moderatesearch radius, and the third deterministic with short-search radius. In line with this, it has been identified that the original ABC algorithm also explores the search space over three stages that could correspond to three memes: the first stochastic with a long-search radius (food sources), the second stochastic with a moderate-search radius (employed foragers), and the third random with long-search radius (unemployed foragers).\nUnfortunately, the deterministic meme with a short-search radius is missing from this identification. Therefore, the original ABC algorithm has been hybridized with the local search heuristics representing this deterministic meme. Two local search methods were applied within the proposed memetic ABC (MABC) algorithm: the Nelder/Mead (NM) simplex method [35] and the random walk method with direction exploitation (RWDE) [35]. The former is designed more towards exploration, whilst the latter more towards exploitation of the continuous search space. The stochastic adaptive rule as specified by Neri [9] was applied for balancing the exploration and exploitation.\nIn order to prevent a slow convergence of the original ABC algorithm caused because of a single-dimension update by the crossover operator, a new crossover operator capable of updating multiple dimensions was developed within MABC. Additionally, new mutation strategies similar to DE strategies were incorporated into this algorithm.\nFinally, this MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large Scale Continuous\nGlobal Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation.\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the MABC algorithm. In Section III, the test suite together with the experimental setup is discussed in detail. In Section IV, the obtained results are presented and compared with other algorithms. In Section V, the final remarks are presented, and a look is taken on future work."

      "text" : "GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION\nIn the original ABC algorithm, the foraging process is performed by three groups of bees: employed bees, onlookers, and scouts. Each food source is discovered by only one employed bee. On the basis of information obtained by the employed foragers, the onlooker bees make a decision, which food source to visit. When the food source is exhausted, the corresponding\nunemployed foragers become scouts.\nIn order to make a super-fit individual [9] that guides the direction in which the search space needs to be explored by the bee colony, an additional step is added to the original ABC algorithm, i.e. locally improving the best bee. As a result, the final scheme for the MABC algorithm is obtained as follows:\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudo code of the MABC algorithm\n1: Init(); 2: while !TerminationConditionMeet() do 3: SendEmployedBees(); 4: SendOnlookerBees(); 5: LocalImproveBestBee(); 6: SendScouts(); 7: end while\nMABC is a population-based algorithm of size NP , where the candidate solutions xi are vectors of D design variables within a decision space S. Initial population (function Init() in Algorithm 1) is randomly sampled within decision space S, as follows:\nx (0) i,j = rand (0, 1) . (ub− lb) + lb, for j = 1 . . . D, (1)\nwhere function rand (0, 1) returns a random value between 0 and 1, and lb, ub denote the lower and upper bounds of the candidate solution xi.\nThe core of the foraging process (sequence of function calls in the while loop in Algo-\nrithm 1) consists of four functions:\n• SendEmployedBees(): sending the employed bees onto the food sources and evaluating\ntheir nectar amounts,\n• SendOnlookerBees(): sharing information about food sources with employed bees,\nselecting the proper food source and evaluating their nectar amounts,\n• LocalImproveBestBee(): determining the best food source and improve it,\n• SendScouts(): determining the scout bees and then sending them to find new possibly\nbetter food sources.\nIn the sense of MC analysis due to [18], each of these four functions perform certain\nexploration task, as follows:\n• stochastic long-distance exploration (function SendEmployedBees()),\n• stochastic moderate-distance exploration (function SendOnlookerBees()),\n• deterministic short-distance exploration (function LocalImproveBestBee()),\n• random long-distance exploration (function SendScouts()).\nIn continuation, these exploration tasks are discussed in detail."

      "heading" : "A. Stochastic long-distance exploration",
      "text" : "The stochastic long-distance exploration is performed in the DE fashion [34] as follows. In order to obtain a trial solution, three operators are applied on each candidate’s solution, i.e. mutation, crossover and selection. The mutation operator in MABC implements a ′rand/1/bin ′ like DE mutation strategy, according to Eq. (2):\nv (t) i = x (t) r1 + ( x (t) r2 − x (t) r3 ) , (2)\nwhere r1, r2, r3 denote randomly-selected candidate solutions, and t is the generation number. This operator is slightly different from the original ABC modification operator. Conversely to DE, the constant scale parameter F is unused in the Eq. (2).\nIn place of the original ABC expression for producing a new food position that modifies only single dimension of trial solution, the new expression is developed in MABC that is capable to modify multiple dimensions in trial solution. The number of modifications are controlled by CR parameter as follows:\nu (t) i,j = v (t) i,j if (randj(0, 1) ≤ CR || j == jr4) ,\nx (t) i,j otherwise,\n(3)\nwhere jr4 denotes a random dimension within the trial solution. According to the minimum value of the objective function, the selection operator selects the best between the candidate and trial solution, as expressed in Eq. (4):\nxt+1i = u (t) i if ( f ( u (t) i ) ≤ f ( x (t) i )) x (t) i,j otherwise.\n(4)\nThe long-distance exploration comprises two stochastic mechanisms: the mutation strategy and crossover operators. The first mechanism focuses on exploration because the modified dimensions of the trial solution is independent of the current value, i.e. the new value is sampled as three dimensions of randomly-selected candidate solutions. The second mechanism determines how many modifications should be applied to the trial solution. As a result, this exploration attempts to detect new promising regions within the entire decision space S."

      "text" : "Onlooker bees visit a food source after making a decision if the appropriate food source lacks sufficient nectar amounts. Within more nectar amounts, more bees can be expected in the vicinity of this food source. The property q that the i-th onlooker bee should visit the nectar amount is expressed as follows:\nqi = fi − fworst fbest − fworst , (5)\nwhere fi, fworst and fbest denotes the nectar amounts of i-th, worst and best food sources.\nThe stochastic moderate-distance exploration is performed similarly to long-distance exploration, i.e. a trial solution undergoes acting the three operators: mutation, crossover and selection. Here, MABC implements a ′currenttobest/1/bin ′ like DE strategy as the mutation operator, expressed as:\nv (t) i = x (t) i + ( x (t) best − x (t) i ) + ( x (t) r1 − x (t) r2 )  if (qi < r0)else i = i+ 1 (6) where r0 denotes the randomly generated number between 0 and 1 (rand(0, 1)), r1 and r2 are the randomly-selected candidate solutions and qi is expressed according to Eq. (5). The crossover and selection operators are implemented according to Eqs (3) and (4).\nNote that the trial solution is only generated if the nectar amounts are sufficient. If not, the next food source is selected. This process repeats until the number of onlooker bees does not exceed NP . In this manner, the food sources with more nectar amounts are likely to be visited by onlookers. As a results, onlookers are collected in the vicinity of more promising food sources.\nIn summary, the function SendOnlookerBees() directs onlookers to more promising regions of the search space. The applied mutation operator also contributes to this directed search."

      "heading" : "C. Deterministic short-distance exploration",
      "text" : "The deterministic short-distance exploration tries to fully exploit promising search directions. The goal of this exploration is to bring a candidate solution into the local optimum. In the case that the solution is the global optimum, the search needs to be finished. In MABC, short-distance exploration concerns for maintaining a diversity of population.\nIn population-based algorithms, diversity plays a crucial role in the success of the optimization [29]. The diversity of a population is a measure of the different solutions present [14]. This measure can be expressed as the number of different fitness values present, the number of different phenotypes present, or the number of different genotypes present. In this study, the fitness diversity metric is expressed as [30]:\nΨ = 1− ∣∣∣∣ favg − fbestfworst − fbest ∣∣∣∣ , (7) where favg, fbest, and fworst denote the average, best, and worst fitness of individuals in the population. Note that the metric returns values between 0 and 1.\nThe main characteristic of this metric is that its value is independent on the range of variability the fitness values. It is very sensible to small variations and thus, especially suitable for fitness landscapes containing plateaus and low gradient areas [29]. Although more fitness diversity metrics were used in the experiments, this metric demonstrated that it is the most suitable for the MABC algorithm.\nIn the sense of deterministic short-distance exploration, two local search algorithms were developed that run within the ABC framework. The first is the Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) [28] with exploration features and the second the Random Walk with Direction Exploitation (RWDE) [35] with exploitation features. In order to coordinate the exploration/exploitation process, the following exponential distribution is used:\np (Ψ) = e −(Ψ−µp) 2σ2p , (8)\nwhere Ψ are the fitness diversity metric, and variable µp denotes the mean value and σp is the standard deviation of diversity metric Ψ calculated so far. Both values µp and σp are calculated incrementally in each generation according to the Knuth’s algorithm [22].\nThe following adaptive scheme is applied for balancing between both local search algo-\nrithms:\nif rand (0, 1) > p (Ψ) => use NMAotherwise => use RWDE, (9) where rand (0, 1) denotes a randomly generated value between 0 and 1. From Eq. (9) it can be seen that when the population looses the diversity, i.e. p (Ψ) > 0.5, the NMA exploration algorithm is executed, whilst in contrary the RWDE exploitation algorithm takes the initiative."

In MABC, scouts are simulated by new randomly generated food source that should be discovered by the foragers in the remaining cycles of this algorithm. The food is exhausted when the predefined number of cycles (also named scout limit) has expired, in which no further improvement of the nectar amounts are detected.\nThe scouts are generated according to Eq. (1). Note that this exploration is treated as long-distance because the new food sources are sampled within the whole decision space S. On the other hand, the exploration is blind without any history information explored so far."

In MABC, the original ABC framework does not exploit the MC paradigm as a whole. That is, the memes are executed sequential within each generation. Let us emphasis that the stochastic long-distance (function SendEmployesBees()) and the stochastic moderate-distance (function SendOnlookerBees()) explorations are performed unconditionally, i.e. in each generation. On the other hand, the\nperformances of the deterministic short-distance (function LocalImproveBestBee()) and the random long-distance (function SendScouts()) explorations are controlled by the parameters local search ratio and scouts limit. The first parameter regulates the ratio between the global and local search, whilst the second determines when to start exploring new regions of the continuous search space."

That is, the function f(x) is separable if its parameters xi are independent. In general, the separable functions are considered to be the easiest. In contrast, the fully-nonseparable functions are usually the more difficult to solve [36]. The degree of separability could be controlled by randomly dividing the object variables into several groups, each of which contains a particular number of variables. Although some of used functions are separable in their original forms, applying techniques as Salomon’s random coordinate rotation make them non-separable. Furthermore, the global optimum of the function could also be shifted."

The higher values for the local search ratio had deteriorating effect on the results. In this context, the value r = 0.006 was demonstrated the best results.

The first is dedicated more to exploration,\nwhilst the second more to exploitation of the search space. An adaptive stochastic function was employed in order to balance the process of exploration/exploitation. The results of MABC were performed in the Special Suite on LSGO in the 2012 IEEE CEC, and compared with the results of algorithms: DECC-G, DECC-G* and MLCC. These results were very competitive when compared with the other algorithms. In addition, this algorithm has been analyzed in the spirit of MC, where four exploration stages are identified: stochastic long-distance, stochastic moderate-distance, deterministic short-distance, and random longdistance explorations. Each of these stages should correspond to the particular meme. However, the interaction between memes leaves additional options for further development of this algorithm. Finally, the adaptive stochastic function for balancing the process of exploration/exploitation bases on phenotypic diversity that could be less important in a well-balanced multi-modal landscapes. In order to show how a genotypic diversity influences the results, other diversity measures should be observed in the future."

    "abstractText" : "Large-Scale Global Optimization Iztok Fister,∗ Iztok Fister Jr.,† Janez Brest,‡ and Viljem Žumer§ Abstract Memetic computation (MC) has emerged recently as a new paradigm of efficient algorithms for solving the hardest optimization problems. On the other hand, artificial bees colony (ABC) algorithms demonstrate good performances when solving continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This study tries to use these technologies under the same roof. As a result, a memetic ABC (MABC) algorithm has been developed that is hybridized with two local search heuristics: the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NMA) and the random walk with direction exploitation (RWDE). The former is attended more towards exploration, while the latter more towards exploitation of the search space. The stochastic adaptation rule was employed in order to control the balancing between exploration and exploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large Scale Continuous Global Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. The obtained results the MABC are comparable with the results of DECC-G, DECC-G*, and MLCC. To cite paper as follows: I. Fister, I. Fister Jr., J. Brest, V.
