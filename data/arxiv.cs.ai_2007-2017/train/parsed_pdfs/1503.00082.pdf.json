      "text" : "This paper presents a novel approach for automatic recognition of group activities for video\nsurveillance applications. We propose to use a group representative to handle the recognition with a varying number of group members, and use an Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. Furthermore, we propose a group activity detection algorithm which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric group activities, and demonstrate that this approach enables the detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.\nI. Introduction\nDetecting human group behavior or human interactions has attracted increasing research interests\n[1-6]. Some example group events of interests include people fighting, people being followed, people walking together, terrorist launching attacks in groups, etc. Being able to automatically detect group activities of interests is important for many security applications. In this paper, we address the following issues for group event detection."

      "text" : "Most previous group event detection researches [1-2] use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or its\nvariation to model the human interactions. Some researchers try to recognize human interactions based on a content-independent semantic set [3-4]. However, most of these works are designed to recognize group activities with a fixed number of group members, where the input feature vector\nlength is fixed. They cannot handle the case where the number of group members is varying, which often occurs in our daily life (e.g., people may leave or join a group activity). In this case, the input feature vector length may vary with different number of group members. Although some works [5-6] tried to deal with the detection of group activities with a varying number of members, most of them have assumptions under some specific scenarios which restrict their applications."

For example, in Fig. 1, three people fighting form a subgroup of fighting (the dashed circle). At the same time, another person is approaching the three fighting people and these four people form a larger group of approaching (the solid circle in Fig. 1). This is an example of hierarchical activity structure with the group of approaching at a higher level than the group of fighting. Some algorithms [1-2] could be extended to deal with the problem of hierarchical structure event detection when the number of group members is fixed. Our work addresses the problem of group event detection with a varying number of group members under a hierarchical activity structure."

      "text" : "To solve the problem of the hierarchical activity structure, we classify activities into symmetric\nactivities and asymmetric activities. Assume we have two entities i and j, the activity θ between i and j is defined as a symmetric activity if “i has the activity θ with j” is the same as “j has the activity θ with i”. For example, the activity WalkTogether is a symmetric activity because “i walking together with j”\nis the same as “j walking together with i”. From the above definition, we see that entities belonging to the same symmetric activity play similar roles for the activity and are interchangeable. We can further define the symmetric group as a group of entities where any two entities in the group perform the same symmetric activity. A symmetric group can have a varying number of group members or entities. It should be noted that we also extend the definition of symmetric group to include single entity activity cases. For example, if a person walks alone and does not have any symmetric activity interaction with other people, this single person can form a symmetric group of walking.\nSimilarly, the activity θ between i and j is defined as an asymmetric activity if the activity is not a\nsymmetric activity. For example, the activity Following is an asymmetric activity because “i is following j” is different from “j is following i”.\nWith the introduction of symmetric activity and asymmetric activity, we proposed to solve the\nhierarchical-activity-recognition problem by first clustering people into non-overlapping symmetric groups and then modeling the asymmetric-activity interactions between the symmetric groups. We call this the Symmetric-Asymmetric Activity Structure (SAAS). For example, in the example of Fig. 1, we can first cluster people into two symmetric groups: the three-people fighting group and one person walking group. Then the asymmetric activity Approaching between these four people can be modeled as the interaction between the fighting group and the walking group. It should be noted that the idea of the proposed SAAS is general and can easily be extended to model other hierarchical activity structures. For example, we can model the symmetric activities of two WalkTogether groups as the lower level activity and model the symmetric activity Ignore (i.e. people ignore each other) between these two groups as the higher level activity, thus forms a Symmetric-Symmetric Activity Structure (SSAS)."

In this section, we propose a Seed-Representative-Centered clustering (SRC\nclustering) algorithm. The algorithm is described as follows:\nStep 1) Detecting the cluster seeds.

After detecting the cluster seeds, a post processing is\nperformed to combine seeds that belong to the same symmetric group. Cluster seeds with the same symmetric activity label will be combined together. For example, if (a,b) is a cluster seed and c is another cluster seed, c can be combined with (a,b) to form a larger seed of (a,b,c) if La(b)=La(c)=Lc(a).\nStep 3) Calculate Seed Representatives (SR) for the cluster seeds. We can combine people in the\nsame cluster seed to create a Seed Representative (SR) for each cluster seed. There can be many ways to define the Seed Representative. For example, we could pick any feature vector close to the cluster center as the Seed Representative. In this paper, the average\nfeature vector of people in the same seed is used as the SR for the cluster seeds.\nStep 4) Cluster the remaining people based on the SRs.

Therefore, the selected GR will have a global view of the whole group.\nMore importantly, when detecting the asymmetric activity between two symmetric groups,\nsome people that are not highly related may distu Fig. 4, the asymmetric activity θ between A and B is mainly decided by the interaction between the bold-faced people (i.e. bold-faced circles in Fig. 4) in A and the bold-faced people in B. The dotted person located on the side of A does not have high correlation in θ with people in B and may have misclassified activity label with B. This dotted person is an outlier and may disturb the recognition results. When using methods such as MV to perform recognition, the dotted outlier person is included and the recognition accuracy may be decreased. However, when using GR with our proposed method (especially the P-GR and the SV-GR), the low-correlated outlier person will be discarded from the asymmetric activity detection process, thus reducing the disturbance from these outlier people. Therefore, our proposed GR will also increase the recognition accuracy by efficiently discarding outliers.\nIn th\nwith other methods.

The definitions of these eight activities are listed in Table 1. We classify these eight activities into two categories with InGroup, WalkTogether, Ignore, Fight and RunTogether as symmetric activities, and Approach, Split and Chase as asymmetric activities. It should be noted that we extended the definition of activity Ignore. The two people will ignore each other if they do not have other activity correlation. Furthermore, Ignore will also be used to model the non-interaction case between two symmetric groups. We also add a single activity into the symmetric activity list for those people that cannot be clustered into any symmetric group.\nthe features used for group activity recognition. Note that the proposed algorithm is not limited to the MBB features. Other more sophisticated features [19,20] can easily be applied to our algorithm to give better results. Six features are used for calculating the persons’ activity correlation metrics in Eqn (3). They are listed in Table 2.\nwhich is available in the BEHAVE dataset to get the MBB information. In practice, various practical\n, there are in\ntotal\ntracking methods [15,21] can be used to obtain the MBB information. Furthermore, the thresholds Tc, To and TR in Eqn. (5), (6) and (9) are set to be 0.1, 0.95 and 0.3, respectively. These values are manually selected based on the statistics from one of the training sets. In practice, these thresholds can also be selected by some more sophisticated ways such as the validation set method [9].\nIn our experiments, four methods are compared. For all the HMMs or AHMMs in these methods,\nwe use two hidden states for each activity (plus the starting state and the finishing state\nfour states) and a two-mixture Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) [23,24] for modeling the\nemission probability for each hidden state. It should be noted that the methods selected to compare in our experiments are typical and the results can easily be extended to other related methods [2,13,16,19]. The four methods are described as follows:\n1) HMM. Use a single HMM [12,21] to recognize either the symmetric activites or the\nasymmetric activities. When recognizing symmetric activities, the group features in Table 3\nare calculated for each symmetric group. However, it should be noted that the traditional HMM cannot deal with the recognition of hierarchical-structure activities (i.e., a single HMM cannot recognize a lower-level symmetric activity and an upper-level asymmetric activity at the same time). Furthermore, since the input feature vector length is fixed, it also cannot recognize activity with varying number of group members.\nas input to recognize asymmetric activities, as in Fig. 6. Furthermore, extra features are also calculated as input to the higher layer HMM [1]. In our experiment, we use hard decision outputs [1] of the lower layer HMMs as the input to the higher layer HMM. Furthermore, features in Table 2 are used as the extra features for inputting to the higher layer HMM. The extra features are calculated between two symmetric sub-groups. However, similar to HMM, since the input feature vector length of the layered HMM is also fixed, it cannot deal with the problem of activity recognition with varying number of group members.\n6.

When detecting the symmetric activities, two different methods are used: (a) use the activity label for each cluster seed as the recognized activity for the symmetric group (SAAS+SRC+MV-1 in Tables 5-9), and (b) calculate the group features from the symmetric group and use the HMM model for recognition, as in Eqn (10) (SAAS+SRC+MV-2 in Tables 5-9).

These four sets of experiments will be described in detail in the following sections. Table 4 summarizes the capabilities of the four methods in dealing with these four experimental tasks.

Basically, the major difference between the methods of these two sets is that methods in Set-1 can have a global view of the whole symmetric group by using the group features, while the methods in Set-2 only use local information of the cluster seeds for recognition.\nHowever, from Table 5, we can see that the TFER for both sets are very close. Similar results can also be found for larger numbers of group members. This implies that since members in the symmetric group are interchangeable and similar, using only local information from parts of the group members may be enough to recognize symmetric activities."

Therefore, the result further implies that P-GR can improve the results from V-GR by discarding the outliers from recognition. Since both the GRAD method and the Layered HMM+SAAS method can recognize hierarchical structure activities, we will discuss more of these two methods in the following section.\nmental results for recognizing hie\nIn this section, we perform experiments to recognize hierarchical structure activities which\ncontain fo\netric activities (Approach, Split, and Chase). Similar to the previous experiment, we fix the\nnumber of people in each asymmetric group as 4, and each asymmetric group contains two symmetric sub-groups with one group containing 3 people and the other group containing 1 person. For simplification, we only recognize the symmetric activity of the 3-people sub-group and the asymmetric activity of the 4 people group in this experiment.\nAs mentioned in Table 4, the HMM method cannot recognize hierarchical-structure activities.\nTherefore, we only compare the other three methods. Table 7 shows the results for hierarc\nhical-structure activity recognition under 50% training and 50% testing.\nor symmetric activities and asymmetric activities in Table 7 are exactly the same as those in\n3,16,19] cannot handle the recognition with a varying number of group members while\n2)\nese\nresults f Table 5 and Table 6, respectively. We can see from Table 7 that the GRAD method and the Layered HMM+SAAS method have similar performance. However, compared with the Layered HMM+SAAS method as well as other HMM-based methods [15-19], our proposed GRAD method has the following advantages:\n1) The Layered HMM+SAAS method as well as most other HMM-based methods\n[2,1 our GRAD algorithm can handle this problem by the use of the Group Representative. More importantly, there may be hierarchical-structure activities with more than two levels. For example, several asymmetric groups may form a super symmetric group and th super symmetric groups may further form an even larger asymmetric group. In these cases, the HMM-based methods may require very complicated models for recognition which\nmay be very difficult for training and calculation. However, since our GRAD method only extracts GRs from the groups for the recognition in the higher level, it can be kept simple even for those multi-level-structure activities.\nental results for recognizing hierarchical-s D.

In this section, we will perform experiments for the general scenario of hierarchical-structure activities with a varying number of group members and try to recognize all of the group activities in Table 1 for all symmetric and asymmetric groups. From Table 4, we can see that only the SAAS+SRC+MV method and the GRAD method can handle the task in this experiment. Therefore, we only compare these two methods in this section.\nIn this experiment, we randomly select three long sequences for training and use the other three\nlong sequences for testing. Five independent experiments are perf\nThe experimental results of SAAS+SRC+MV-1 and GRAD-1 are shown in Fig. 7. For the\nGRAD method, three different GRs are used: (a) Physical GR (P-GR in Fig. 7), (b) Virtual GR (V-GR\n. 7) and (c) Selective Virtual GR (SV-GR in Fig. 7). In order to show the advantage of using\nAHMM, we also includes the results of using regular HMM [22] for modeling the activity correlation metric (with “HMM” in Fig. 7, e.g., SAAS+SRC+MV-1 (HMM)).\nIn order to take clustering errors into consideration, two error rates are compared in Table 8: the\nGroup Clustering Error Rate (GCER) and the Event Detection Error Ra\n12) and (13) respectively.\nframes total of frameserror clustering of GCER #= (12) #\nframes total of# frameserror of EDER #=\nwhere a frame is a clustering error frame if any person in the frame is mis-clustered into another\n(13)\nsymmetric grou f the following take place: (a) any person in p, and a frame is an error frame if any o the frame is mis-clustered into another symmetric group, (b) any of the symmetric activities is misclassified, and (c) any of the asymmetric activities is misclassified.\nThe GCER reflects the performance of the algorithm in clustering people into symmetric groups.\nThe EDER reflects the overall performance of the algorithm in detecting both the symmetric activities and the asymmetric activities.\nSince all methods use the propos g algorithm for clustering people into\nsymmetric groups, their GCERs are the same if using the same activity-correlation-metric model. Therefore SAAS+SRC+MV-1, GRAD-1 using P-GR,\nSeveral observations from Fig. 7 are listed below:\ned SRC c sterinlu\n, we can see from Fig. 7 that the GCERs of\nGRAD-1 using V-GR, and GRAD-1 using SV-GR are the same. Similarly, the GCERS of SAAS+SRC+MV-1 (HMM), GRAD-1 using P-GR (HMM), GRAD-1 using V-GR (HMM), and GRAD-1 using SV-GR (HMM) are the same. The low GCER demonstrates the effectiveness of the SRC clustering algorithm. Furthermore, methods using AHMM as an activity-correlation-metric model has a better GCER than those use HMM. This demonstrates that using AHMM can improve the\nperformance by handling the possible action asynchronies.\nComparing the EDER, we can see that the EDERs of the GRAD algorithm are obviously better\nthan that uses majority vote. This supports our claim that the introduction of GR can greatly improve\nin Table 1, where the SV-GR is used for the GRAD algorithm. The Miss\nthe detection rate for asymmetric activities. Comparing the three GR-based methods, we can see that the EDER of P-GR is better than that of V-GR. This further demonstrates that the P-GR can improve the performance by discarding outliers from asymmetric activity recognition. However, the EDER difference between these two GRs is not large. This is because (a) although V-GR includes outliers, the effect of these outliers is decreased by the averaging with non-outliers, and (b) there may be cases where none of the actual person in the symmetric group is representative enough for the group, in these cases, the P-GR may not perform better than the V-GR. Furthermore, the method using SV-GR has the best EDER. This is because SV-GR has the following two advantages: (a) similar to P-GR, SV-GR can discard outliers by averaging only the most several representative people in the group, and (b) in case when there is no actual person representative for the group, SV-GR can create a virtual GR by averaging several people in the group. However, we can also see from Table 8 that the improvement of SV-GR from P-GR is small. This is because (a) the clustering errors (i.e. GCER) take a large portion of the errors in EDER. This limits the improvement space of SV-GR. It is expected that the performance of the GRAD algorithm can be further improved if people can be clustered better into symmetric groups. (b) Due to the scenarios of the BEHAVE dataset, people in each symmetric sub-group are comparatively close to each other, therefore the chances that none of the actual person is representative are low.\nFig. 8 shows the average False Alarm rate (FA) and Miss Detection rate (Miss) [9] of the GRAD algorithm for the activities\nrate is defined by + θ θ cnt\ncnt fn , where fncnt is the number of false negative (misdetection)\nsamples for activity\nθ\nθ , and +cnt θ otal is the t number of positive samples of activity θ in the\ntest data.

However, the Miss\ne (a) the input features are very simple which are all derived from the MBB information, (b) the\nnumber of training samples for these activities is small, and (c) it is more difficult to correctly cluster the symmetric activities such as Fighting due to their large variance. Therefore, in order to further improve the performance, more sophisticated input features [19, 20] can be used and the methods to train models in case of insufficient training data can be introduced [9, 25]. Furthermore, Fig. 8 also shows a large FA rate in the activity Ignore. This is because Ignore is a generalized activity in our experiment. Since we model Ignore as the non-interaction case between people, it can be confused with all the other activities including both symmetric and asymmetric ones. This leads to the large number of samples misclassified as Ignore.\n1.2\n10.1\n24.7 30\n35\n17.4\n5.4 8.1 8.8\n27.3\n2.08 3.85\n0.82 0.22\n6.03 3.6\n1.08 0.69 0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\nMiss (%) FA (%)\nSymmetric Activities Asymmetric Activities Fig. 8.

For example, one approaching group may chase another splitting group and these two asymmetric groups will form a super asymmetric group. In these cases, we can extend our Group Representative method so that GRs can also be calculated and used to represent asymmetric groups. Furthermore, we can also extend our SAAS to model different activity structures. In the above example, we can first extend our SAAS by adding one more asymmetric activity level over the original asymmetric level to form a Symmetric-Asymmetric-Asymmetric Activity Structure. The chase activity can then be recognized based on the interactions between the two GRs of the two asymmetric sub-groups of approaching and splitting. In the experiments of this paper, all asymmetric activities take place only between two symmetric sub-groups. However, there may be cases th place among three or more entities. For example, person A is approaching the symmetric sub-group B, at the same time, another person C is also approaching group B from another direction. These three symmetric subgroups A, B and C will form an asymmetric group of approaching. In these cases, we can extend our SRC clustering method to further cluster symmetric subgroups into asymmetric groups. In the above example, we can first calculate the distance metrics between A, B and C based on their asymmetric interaction, and then cluster them into one asymmetric group.\n3)\ner people into symmetric sub-groups, and use"
