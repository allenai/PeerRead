      "text" : "Dropout has been widely used to avoid overfitting of deep neural networks with a large number of parameters (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014), which usually identically and independently at random samples neurons and sets their outputs to be zeros. Extensive experiments (Hinton et al., 2012) have shown that dropout can help obtain the state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmark data sets. Recently, dropout has also been found to improve the performance of logistic regression and other single-layer models for natural language tasks such as document classification and named entity recognition.\nIn this paper, instead of identically and independently at random zeroing out features or neurons, we propose to use multinomial sampling for dropout, i.e., sampling features or neurons according to a multinomial distribution with different probabilities for different features/neurons. Intuitively, it makes more sense to use non-uniform multinomial sampling than identical and independent sampling for different features/neurons. For example, in shallow learning if there are some features that have zero variance, we can dropout these features more frequently or completely allowing the training to focus on more important features and consequentially enabling faster convergence. To justify the multinomial sampling for dropout and reveal the optimal sampling probabilities, we conduct a rigorous analysis on the risk bound of shallow learning by stochastic optimization with multinomial dropout, and demonstrate that a distribution-dependent dropout leads to a smaller expected risk (i.e., faster convergence and smaller generalization error).\nInspired by the distribution-dependent dropout, we propose a data-dependent dropout for shallow learning, and an evolutional dropout for deep learning. For shallow learning, the sampling probabilities are computed from the second\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n02 22\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 6\nF eb\norder statistics of features of the training data. For deep learning, the sampling probabilities of dropout for a layer are computed on-the-fly from the second-order statistics of the layer’s outputs based on a mini-batch of examples. This is particularly suited for deep learning because (i) the distribution of each layer’s outputs is evolving over time, which is known as internal covariate shift (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015); (ii) passing through all the training data in deep neural networks (in particular deep convolutional neural networks) is much more expensive than through a mini-batch of examples. For a mini-batch of examples, we can leverage parallel computing architectures to accelerate the computation of sampling probabilities.\nWe note that the proposed evolutional dropout achieves similar effect to the batch normalization technique (Znormalization based on a mini-batch of examples) (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) but with different flavors. Both approaches can be considered to tackle the issue of internal covariate shift for accelerating the convergence. Batch normalization tackles the issue by normalizing the output of neurons to zero mean and unit variance and then performing dropout independently 1. In contrast, our proposed evolutional dropout tackles this issue from another perspective by exploiting a distribution-dependent dropout, which adapts the sampling probabilities to the evolving distribution of a layer’s outputs. In other words, it uses normalized sampling probabilities based on the second order statistics of internal distributions. Indeed, we notice that for shallow learning with Z-normalization (normalizing each feature to zero mean and unit variance) the proposed datadependent dropout reduces to uniform dropout that acts similar to the standard dropout. Because of this connection, the presented theoretical analysis also sheds some lights on the power of batch normalization from the angle of theory. Compared to batch normalization, the proposed distribution-dependent dropout is still attractive because (i) it is rooted in theoretical analysis of the risk bound; (ii) it introduces no additional parameters and layers without complicating the back-propagation and the inference; (iii) it facilitates further research because its shares the same mathematical foundation as standard dropout (e.g., equivalent to a form of data-dependent regularizer) (Wager et al., 2013).\nWe summarize the main contributions of the paper below.\n• We propose a multinomial dropout and demonstrate that a distribution-dependent dropout leads to a faster convergence and a smaller generalization error through the risk bound analysis for shallow learning.\n• We propose an efficient evolutional dropout for deep 1The author also reported that in some cases dropout is even\nnot necessary\nlearning based on the distribution-dependent dropout.\n• We justify the proposed dropouts for both shallow learning and deep learning by experimental results on several benchmark datasets.\nIn the reminder, we first review some related work and preliminaries.

      "text" : "In this section, we review some related work on dropout, optimization algorithms for deep learning and distributiondependent or sampling-dependent error bounds.\nDropout is a simple yet effective technique to prevent overfitting in training deep neural networks (Srivastava et al., 2014). It has received much attention recently from researchers to study its practical and theoretical properties. Notably, Wager et al. (2013); Baldi & Sadowski (2013) have analyzed the dropout from a theoretical viewpoint and found that dropout is equivalent to a data-dependent regularizer. The most simple form of dropout is to multiply hidden units by i.i.d Bernoulli noise. Several recent works also found that using other types of noise works as well as Bernoulli noise (e.g., Gaussian noise), which could lead to a better approximation of the marginalized loss (Wang & Manning, 2013; Kingma et al., 2015). Some works tried to optimize the hyper-parameters that define the noise level in a Bayesian framework (Zhuo et al., 2015; Kingma et al., 2015). Graham et al. (2015) used the same noise across a batch of examples in order to speed-up the computation. Other studies focus on shallow learning with dropout noise (Wager et al., 2014; Helmbold & Long, 2014; Chen et al., 2014). It has been applied to improve the performance of logistic regression, support vector machine and other single-layer models for natural language tasks such as document classification, named entity recognition, etc. The present work proposes a new dropout with noise sampled according to distribution-dependent sampling probabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously studies this type of dropout with theoretical analysis of the risk bound. It is shown that the new dropout improves the performance in convergence speed dramatically.\nStochastic gradient descent with back-propagation has been used a lot in optimizing deep neural networks. However, it is notorious for its slow convergence especially for deep learning. Recently, there emerge a battery of studies trying to accelearte the optimization of deep learning (Sutskever et al., 2013; Neyshabur et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014; Martens & Grosse, 2015; Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Kingma & Ba, 2014), which tackle the problem from\ndifferent perspectives. Among them, we notice that developed evolutional dropout for deep learning achieves similar effect as batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) addressing the internal covariate shift issue (i.e., evolving distributions of internal hidden units). However, there also exist significant differences from the batch normalization that have been highlighted in the previous section.\nThe distribution-dependent sampling and distributiondependent risk bounds presented in this work share similar spirit to some recent works in shallow learning and other areas. Yang et al. (2015) developed sampling-dependent approximation error bound for column subset selection problem and tried to optimize the sampling-dependent error bound to obtain optimal sampling probabilities. Kukliansky & Shamir (2015) proposed a similar distributiondependent sampling for attribute-efficient learning in linear regression. However, our work has a very different focus. They focused on minimizing the standard expected risk and using sampled features to compute an unbiased stochastic gradient of the risk. Here, we focus on minimizing the dropout risk (the risk defined over corrupted features) and tackle both shallow learning and deep learning. Distribution-dependent risk bounds have also been examined in several studies (Sabato et al., 2013)."

      "heading" : "3. Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section, we present some preliminaries, including the framework of risk minimization in machine learning and learning with dropout noise. We also introduce the multinomial dropout, which allows us to construct a distribution-dependent dropout as revealed in next section.\nLet (x, y) denote a feature vector and a label, where x ∈ Rd and y ∈ Y . Denote by P the joint distribution of (x, y) and denote by D the marginal distribution of x. The goal of risk minimization is to learn a prediction function f(x) that minimizes the expected loss, i.e.,\nmin f∈H EP [`(f(x), y)]\nwhere `(z, y) is a loss function (e.g., the logistic loss) that measures the inconsistency between z and y. In deep learning, the prediction function f(x) is determined by a deep neural network. In shallow learning, one might be interested in learning a linear model f(x) = w>x. In the following presentation, the analysis will focus on the risk minimization of a linear model, i.e.,\nmin w∈Rd\nL(w) , EP [`(w>x, y)] (1)\nIn this paper, we are interested in learning with dropout, i.e., the feature vector x is corrupted by a dropout noise. In particular, let ∼ M denote a dropout noise vector of\ndimension d, and the corrupted feature vector is given by x̂ = x◦ , where he operator ◦ represents the element-wise multiplication. Let P̂ denote the joint distribution of the new data (x̂, y) and D̂ denote the marginal distribution of x̂. With the corrupted data, the risk minimization becomes\nmin w∈Rd\nL̂(w) , EP̂ [`(w >(x ◦ ), y)] (2)\nIn standard dropout (Wager et al., 2013; Hinton et al., 2012), the entries of the noise vector are sampled independently according to Pr( j = 0) = δ and Pr( j = 1 1−δ ) = 1 − δ, i.e., features are dropped with a probability δ and scaled by 11−δ with a probability 1 − δ. We can also write j = bj 1−δ , where bj ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ [d] are i.i.d Bernoulli random variables with Pr(bj = 1) = 1− δ. The scaling factor 11−δ is added to ensure that E [x̂] = x. It is obvious that using the standard dropout different features will have equal probabilities to be dropped out or to be selected independently. However, in practice some features could be more informative than the others for learning purpose. Therefore, it makes more sense to assign different sampling probabilities for different features and make the features compete with each other.\nTo this end, we introduce the following multinomial dropout.\nDefinition 1. (Multinomial Dropout) A multinomial dropout is defined as x̂ = x ◦ , where i = mikpi , i ∈ [d] and {m1, . . . ,md} follow a multinomial distribution Mult(p1, . . . , pd; k) with ∑d i=1 pi = 1 and pi ≥ 0.\nRemark: The multinomial dropout allows us to use nonuniform sampling probabilities p1, . . . , pd for different features. The value of mi is the number of times that the i-th feature is selected in k independent trials of selection. In each trial, the probability that the i-th feature is selected is given by pi. As in the standard dropout, the normalization by kpi is to ensure that E [x̂] = x. The parameter k plays the same role as the parameter 1 − δ in standard dropout, which controls the number of features to be dropped. In particular, the expected total number of the kept features using multinomial dropout is k and that using standard dropout is d(1 − δ). In the sequel, to make fair comparison between the two dropouts, we let k = d(1 − δ). In this case, when a uniform distribution pi = 1/d is used in multinomial dropout to which we refer as uniform dropout, then i = mi1−δ , which acts similarly to the standard dropout using i.i.d Bernoulli random variables. Note that another choice to make the sampling probabilities different is still using i.i.d Bernoulli random variables but with different probabilities for different features. However, multinomial dropout is more suitable because (i) it is easy to control the level of dropout by varying the value of k; (ii) it gives rise to natural competition among features because of the\nconstraint ∑ i pi = 1; (iii) it allows us to minimize the sampling dependent risk bound for obtaining a better distribution than uniform sampling.\nDropout is a data-dependent regularizer Dropout as a regularizer has been studied in (Wager et al., 2013; Baldi & Sadowski, 2013) for logistic regression, which is stated in the following proposition for ease of discussion later.\nProposition 1. If `(z, y) = log(1 + exp(−yz)), then\nEP̂ [`(w >x̂, y)] = EP [`(w >x, y)] +RD,M(w) (3)\nwhereM denotes the distribution of and\nRD,M(w) = ED,M\n[ log exp(w> x◦ 2 ) + exp(−w > x◦ 2 )\nexp(w>x/2) + exp(−w>x/2)\n]\nRemark: It is notable that RD,M ≥ 0 due to the Jensen inequality. Using the second order Taylor expansion, (Wager et al., 2013) showed that the following approximation of RD,M(w) is easy to manipulate and understand:\nR̂D,M(w) = ED[q(w >x)(1− q(w>x))w>CM(x ◦ )w] 2\n(4)\nwhere q(w>x) = 1 1+exp(−w>x/2) , and CM denotes the covariance matrix in terms of . In particular, if is the standard dropout noise, then\nCM[x ◦ ] = diag(x21δ/(1− δ), . . . , x2dδ/(1− δ))\nwhere diag(s1, . . . , sn) denotes a d × d diagonal matrix with the i-th entry equal to si.

      "heading" : "4. Learning with Multinomial Dropout",
      "text" : "In this section, we analyze a stochastic optimization approach for minimizing the dropout loss in (2). Assume the sampling probabilities are known. We first obtain a risk bound of learning with multinomial dropout for stochastic optimization. Then we try to minimize the factors in the risk bound that depend on the sampling probabilities. We would like to emphasize that our goal here is not to show that using dropout would render a smaller risk than without using dropout, but rather focus on the impact of different sampling probabilities on the risk. Let the initial solution be w1. At the iteration t, we sample (xt, yt) ∼ P and t ∼M as in Definition 1 and then update the model by\nwt+1 = wt − ηt∇`(w>t (xt ◦ t), yt) (6)\nwhere ∇` denotes the (sub)gradient in terms of wt and ηt is a step size. Suppose we run the stochastic optimization by n steps (i.e., using n examples) and compute the final solution as\nŵn = 1\nn n∑ t=1 wt.\nWe note that another approach of learning with dropout is to minimize the empirical risk by marginalizing out the dropout noise, i.e., replacing the true expectations EP and ED in (3) with empirical expectations over a set of samples (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) denoted by EPn and EDn . Since the data dependent regularizer RDn,M(w) is difficult to compute, one usually uses an approximation R̂Dn,M(w) (e.g., as in (4)) in place of RDn,M(w). However, the resulting problem is a non-convex optimization, which together with the approximation error would make the risk analysis much more involved. In contrast, the update in (6) can be considered as a stochastic gradient descent update for solving the convex optimization problem in (2), allowing us to establish the risk bound based on previous results of stochastic gradient descent for risk minimization (ShalevShwartz et al., 2009; Srebro et al., 2010). Nonetheless, this restriction does not loss the generality. Indeed, stochastic optimization is usually employed for solving empirical loss minimization in big data and deep learning.\nThe following theorem establishes a risk bound of ŵn in expectation.\nTheorem 1. Let L(w) be the expected risk of w defined in (1). Assume ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] ≤ B2 and `(z, y) is GLipschitz continuous. For any ‖w∗‖2 ≤ r, by appropriately choosing η, we can have\nE[L(ŵn) +RD,M(ŵn)]\n≤ L(w∗) +RD,M(w∗) + GBr√ n\nwhere E[·] is taking expectation over the randomness in (xt, yt, t), t = 1, . . . , n.\nRemark: In the above theorem, we can choose w∗ to be the best model that minimizes the expected risk in (1). Since RD,M (w) ≥ 0, the upper bound in the theorem above is also the upper bond of the risk of ŵn, i.e., L(ŵn), in expectation. The proof of the above theorem follows the standard analysis of stochastic gradient descent. The detailed proof of theorem is included in the appendix."

      "text" : "Next, we consider the sampling dependent factors in the risk bounds. From Theorem 1, we can see that there are two terms that depend on the sampling probabilities, i.e.,\nB2 - the upper bound of ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2], and RD,M(w∗) − RD,M(ŵn) ≤ RD,M(w∗). We note that the second term also depend on w∗ and ŵn, which is more difficult to optimize. We first try to minimize ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] and present the discussion on minimizing RD,M(w∗) later. From Theorem 1, we can see that minimizing ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] would lead to not only a smaller risk (given the same number of total examples, smaller ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] gives a smaller risk bound) but also a faster convergence (with the same number of iterations, smaller ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] gives a smaller optimization error).\nThe following proposition simplifies the expectation ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2]. Proposition 2. Let follow the distributionM defined in Definition 1. Then\nED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] =\n1\nk d∑ i=1 1 pi ED[x 2 i ] + k − 1 k d∑ i=1 ED[x 2 i ]\n(7)\nProof. We have\nED̂‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2 = ED [ d∑ i=1 x2i k2p2i E[m2i ] ] Since {m1, . . . ,md} follows a multinomial distribution Mult(p1, . . . , pd; k), we have\nE[m2i ] = var(mi) + (E[mi]) 2 = kpi(1− pi) + k2p2i\nThe result in the Proposition follows by combining the above two equations.\nGiven the expression of ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] in Proposition 2, we can minimize it over p, leading to the following result.\nProposition 3. The solution to\np∗ = arg min p≥0,p>1=1\nED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2]\nis given by\np∗i = √ ED[x2i ]∑d\nj=1 √ ED[x2j ] , i = 1, . . . , d (8)\nProof. Note that only the first term in the R.H.S of (7) depends on pi. Thus, p∗ = arg minp≥0,p>1=1 ∑d i=1 ED[x 2 i ] pi . The result then follows the KKT conditions.\nNext, we examine RD,M(w∗). Since direct manipulation on RD,M(w∗) is difficult, we try to minimize the second order Taylor expansion R̂D,M(w∗) for logistic loss. The following theorem establishes an upper bound of R̂D,M(w∗).\nProposition 4. Let follow the distributionM defined in Definition 1. We have\nR̂D,M(w∗) ≤ 1\n8k ‖w∗‖22 ( d∑ i=1 ED[x 2 i ] pi − ED[‖x‖22] )\nRemark: The proof is included in the appendix. By minimizing the relaxed upper bound in Proposition 4, we obtain the same sampling probabilities as in (8). We note that a tighter upper bound can be established, however, which will yield sampling probabilities dependent on the unknown w∗.\nIn summary, using the probabilities in (8), we can reduce both ED̂[‖x ◦ ‖ 2 2] and RD,M(w∗) in the risk bound, leading to a faster convergence and a smaller generalization error. In practice, we can use empirical second-order statistics to compute the probabilities, i.e.,\npi =\n√ 1 n ∑n j=1[[xj ]\n2 i ]∑d\ni′=1 √ 1 n ∑n j=1[[xj ] 2 i′ ]\n(9)\nwhere [xj ]i denotes the i-th feature of the j-th example, which gives us a data-dependent dropout. We state it formally in the following definition.\nDefinition 2. (Data-dependent Dropout) Given a set of training examples (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn). A datadependent dropout is defined as x̂ = x ◦ , where i = mi kpi , i ∈ [d] and {m1, . . . ,md} follow a multinomial distribution Mult(p1, . . . , pd; k) with pi given by (9).\nRemark: Note that if the data is normalized such that each feature has zero mean and unit variance (i.e., according to Z-normliazation), the data-dependent dropout reduces to uniform dropout. It implies that the data-dependent dropout achieves similar effect as Z-normalization plus uniform dropout. In this sense, our theoretical analysis also explains why Z-normalization usually speeds up the training (Ranzato et al., 2010)."

      "text" : "Next, we discuss how to implement the distributiondependent dropout for deep learning. In training deep neural networks, the dropout is usually added to the intermediate layers (e.g., fully connected layers and convolutional layers). Let xl = (xl1, . . . , x l d) denote the outputs of the l-th layer (with the index of data omitted). Adding dropout to this layer is equivalent to multiplying xl by a dropout noise vector l, i.e., feeding x̂l = xl ◦ l as the input to the next layer. Inspired by the data-dependent dropout, we can generate l according to a distribution given in Definition 1 with sampling probabilities pli computed from {xl1, . . . ,xln} similar to that (9). However, deep\nlearning is usually trained with big data and a deep neural network is optimized by mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. Therefore, at each iteration it would be too expensive to afford the computation to pass through all examples. To address this issue, we propose to use a mini-batch of examples to calculate the second-order statistics similar to what was done in batch normalization. Let X l = (xl1, . . . ,x l m) denote the outputs of the l-th layer for a mini-batch of m examples. Then we can calculate the probabilities for dropout by\npli =\n√ 1 m ∑m j=1[[x\nl j ] 2 i ]∑d\ni′=1 √ 1 m ∑m j=1[[x l j ] 2 i′ ] , i = 1, . . . , d (10)\nwhich define the evolutional dropout named as such because the probabilities pli will also evolve as the the distribution of the layer’s outputs evolve. We describe the evolutional dropout as applied to a layer of a deep neural network in Figure 1.\nFinally, we would like to compare the evolutional dropout with batch normalization. Similar to batch normalization, evolutional dropout can also address the internal covariate shift issue by adapting the sampling probabilities to the evolving distribution of layers’ outputs. However, different from batch normalization, evolutional dropout is a randomized technique, which enjoys many benefits as standard dropout including (i) the back-propagation is simple to implement (just multiplying the gradient of X̂ l by the dropout mask to get the gradient of X l); (ii) the inference (i.e., testing) remains the same 2; (iii) it is equivalent to a datadependent regularizer with a clear mathematical explanation; (iv) it prevents units from co-adapting and allows combining exponentially many different neural network ar-\n2Different from some implementations for standard dropout which doest no scale by 1/(1 − δ) in training but scale by 1 − δ in testing, here we do scale in training and thus do not need any scaling in testing.\nchitectures efficiently (Srivastava et al., 2014), which facilitate generalization.

The number of iterations for convergence is taken as the smallest iteration number that achieves a testing error within 10−4 precision of the minimum testing error. Then, we compute the relative improvement of the evolutional dropout on both metrics by dividing the absolute improvement by the measures of the standard dropout. The results are reported in Table 2. We can see that both the testing performance and the convergence speed are improved substantially."

      "text" : "Finally, we make a comparison between the evolutional dropout and the batch normalization. For batch normal-\nization, we use the implementation in Caffe 5. We compare the evolutional dropout with the batch normalization on CIFAR-10 data set. The network structure is from the Caffe package and can be found in the appendix, which is different from the one used in the previous experiment. It contains three convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. Each convolutional layer is followed by a pooling layer. We compare three methods: (i) No BN and No Dropout - without using batch normalization and dropout; (ii) BN; (iii) Evolutional Dropout. For BN, three batch normalization layers are inserted before or after each pooling layer following the architecture given in Caffe package. For the evolutional dropout training, only one layer of dropout is added to the the last convolutional layer. The sigmoid activation function is used in BN because it gives better performance than the rectified linear activation function (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). For the other two methods, we use the rectified linear activation function. The minibatch size is set to 100, the default value in Caffe. The initial learning rates for the three methods are set to the same value (0.001), and they are decreased once by ten times. The testing accuracy versus the number of iterations is plotted in Figure 4, from which we can see that the evolutional\n5https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/\ndropout training achieves significant convergence speed-up and even better prediction performance than BN."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a distribution-dependent dropout for both shallow learning and deep learning. Theoretically, we proved that the new dropout achieves a smaller risk and faster convergence. Based on the distributiondependent dropout, we developed an efficient evolutional dropout for training deep neural networks that adapts the sampling probabilities to the evolving distributions of layers’ outputs. Experimental results on various data sets verified that the proposed dropouts can dramatically improve the convergence and also reduce the testing error."

    "abstractText" : "Dropout has been witnessed with great success in training deep neural networks by independently zeroing out the outputs of neurons at random. It has also received a surge of interest for shallow learning, e.g., logistic regression. However, the independent sampling for dropout could be suboptimal for the sake of convergence. In this paper, we propose to use multinomial sampling for dropout, i.e., sampling features or neurons according to a multinomial distribution with different probabilities for different features/neurons. To exhibit the optimal dropout probabilities, we analyze the shallow learning with multinomial dropout and establish the risk bound for stochastic optimization. By minimizing a sampling dependent factor in the risk bound, we obtain a distribution-dependent dropout with sampling probabilities dependent on the second order statistics of the data distribution. To tackle the issue of evolving distribution of neurons in deep learning, we propose an efficient adaptive dropout (named evolutional dropout) that computes the sampling probabilities on-the-fly from a mini-batch of examples. Empirical studies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed dropouts achieve not only much faster convergence and but also a smaller testing error than the standard dropout. For example, on the CIFAR-100 data, the evolutional dropout achieves relative improvements over 10% on the prediction performance and over 50% on the convergence speed compared to the standard dropout.",
