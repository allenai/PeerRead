All three reviewers agree on the potential importance of the proposed algorithm, but they also suggest that more experimental data are needed to demonstrate that GA3C achieves results in the same ballpark as the original A3C. This turns out to be particularly important in the light of the fact that the policy lag in GA3C can potentially introduce instabilities, as noted by Reviewer #1.\n\nWe have included a better description of this in Section 4.4 of the revised paper, as well as analyzed it in a newly added Section 5.3, while providing additional experiments to verify the game performance of GA3C and its stability. As pointed out by the reviewers and already highlighted in the paper, establishing a validation protocol that allows comparing the final scores achieved by GA3C with the scores achieved by other training algorithms is complex or even infeasible, as many implementation details are not shared, as well as validation protocols are poorly reproducible. Beyond that, the final score (still reported in Table 3) tells only part of the story, and therefore we espouse the idea shared by Reviewer #1 and #3 of reporting learning curves as a function of the time. The newly added Fig. 6 and 7 show the learning curves for GA3C and several games as a function of the time. The reader can easily compare these graphs with those reported in Mnih\u2019s paper, as well as in other venues mentioned by the reviewers (e.g. github). The score vs. time curves show a similar dynamic for GA3C and A3C, although it is also important mentioning that curves reported in Mnih\u2019s paper represent the average of the top 5 curves in a set of 50 with various learning rates, which we are unable to match due limitations in available computational resources. Since systems, system loads, environments and hyper-parameters are so widely varying, we also believe that releasing the GA3C code (which we plan to do in the next days) will allow other researchers to systematically evaluate the performances of GA3C and facilitate a fair comparison with new techniques.\n\nReviewer #1\u2019s main concern is about instabilities introduced in GA3C. The training curves reported in the paper indeed show a few instabilities occurring in the training process, but these represent a common phenomenon in RL. Beyond analyzing in Section 4.4 how the policy lag in GA3C can generate these instabilities, we now show experimentally that such instabilities do not affect some games (e.g. Pong), while they can invalidate the learning process in other ones (e.g. Breakout), especially in the case of a large learning rate (Fig. 7 and 8). We found that properly tuning the algorithm hyper-parameters (and in particular the learning rate) dramatically limits the effect of instabilities on the learning process. GA3C would likely benefit from a thorough learning rate search as presented in Mnih\u2019s paper over a set of 50 different learning rates for A3C. Beyond this, we also show how batching on training data (see the newly introduced Section 5.3, and Fig. 7 and 8 in particular) can be used to limit the effect of these instabilities, at the price of a slower convergence rate.\n\nSpecific answers to the individual reviewers follow.\n\n===============================\nReviewer 1\n===============================\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that instabilities may affect the learning process. This is indeed a commonly observed phenomenon in RL. Given the fact that GA3C and A3C are indeed (slightly) different algorithms (as now clearly explained in Section 4.4 of the paper), we followed the reviewer\u2019s suggestion and performed a thorough evaluation of the instabilities of the learning process on several games. Experimental results are reported in Section 5.3 and in Fig. 7 and 8 in particular. These show that, for some games (e.g. Pong), the delayed computation of the gradient terms in GA3C (see Section 4.4) does not introduce convergence issues, that are however present in other games (e.g. Breakout). However, a proper selection of the algorithm hyper-parameters, and of the learning rate in particular, is sufficient to achieve results that are comparable to those achieved by A3C (see Table 3). Quite interestingly, the optimal learning rate for GA3C results to be smaller than the one reported in Mnih\u2019s paper for A3C (as it can be seen in Fig. 6) - this somehow confirms that A3C and GA3C are indeed slightly different algorithms, and GA3C requires careful parameter tuning to obtain optimal results. We also demonstrated that batching of the training data can be used to limit the instabilities, at the price of a slower convergence rate.\n\n===============================\nReviewer 2\n===============================\n\nFollowing the suggestion of the other two reviewers, and sharing the conviction that replicating the Deep Mind evaluation protocol is non-trivial, we now report in the paper more training curves for several games (Fig. 6) as a function of the training time. This allows the reader to perform a direct comparison between our training curves and the ones reported in Mnih\u2019s paper, independently from the hardware system used for training. Although, the reader should be careful about this comparison since Mnih\u2019s graphs show top 5 out of 50 runs which is hard to compare with the small number of runs considered in Fig. 6. These curves demonstrate that training time is comparable while achieving a similar training score. The analysis of the theoretical discrepancies between A3C and GA3C (Section 4.4) and its experimental evaluation in terms of instabilities (Section 5.3) should also serve to clarify that, once the hyper-parameters are properly set, GA3C is comparable to A3C in terms of performance.\nAs for the question about the protocol used for evaluation the score of our trained agents, we now better specify in the caption of table 3 and in the text that we are reporting the average score over 30 different runs for the best agent we trained with GA3C. A direct comparison using the protocol followed in Mnih\u2019s paper is not feasible, as the authors did not share the \u201chuman start condition\u201d for each game.\n\n===============================\nReviewer 3\n===============================\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that showing score vs. time plot would be more informative than reporting only the final score as in Table 3. Therefore, we added Fig. 6 to the paper, showing that, with the proper selection of the hyper-parameters, the dynamic of the learning curves of GA3C is similar to that shown in the original A3C paper by Mnih et al. We believe that other, more precise comparisons in terms of learning speed require an optimized implementation as well as a broad hyper-parameter search (in the style of the original A3C plot, showing top 5 results among a set of 50 learners trained with different learning rates), which is out of the scope for this paper. We also decided to keep Table 3 in the paper - although, as explicitly mentioned in the paper, this information is approximate, it gives an idea that GA3C and A3C achieves final score in the same ballpark.\nWe also suggest that the contribution of our paper is not limited to the implementation of GA3C, but it also includes the analysis of the computational aspects of GA3C and other RL algorithms that can be implemented through a similar architecture. This contribution stands independently from the potential stability issues for GA3C, while the proposed architecture (and the freely available code) can be modified or extended to address these issues, improve the convergence speed, or attack real world problems.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "14 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Final Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper introduces GA3C, a GPU-based implementation of the A3C algorithm, which was originally designed for multi-core CPUs. The main innovation is the introduction of a system of queues. The queues are used for batching data for prediction and training in order to achieve high GPU occupancy. The system is compared to the authors' own implementation of A3C as well as to published reference scores.\n\nThe paper introduces a very natural architecture for implementing A3C on GPUs. Batching requests for predictions and learning steps for multiple actors to maximize GPU occupancy seems like the right thing to do assuming that latency is not an issue. The automatic performance tuning strategy is also really nice to see. \n\nI appreciate the response showing that the throughput of GA3C is 20% higher than what is reported in the original A3C paper. What is still missing is a demonstration that the learning speed/data efficiency is in the right ballpark. Figure 3 of your paper is comparing scores under very different evaluation protocols. These numbers are just not comparable. The most convincing way to show that the learning speed is comparable would be time vs score plots or data vs score plots that show similar or improved speed to A3C.
