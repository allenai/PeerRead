      "text" : "Applications in network analysis, including network pattern recognition, classification, role discovery, and anomaly detection, among others, critically depend on the ability to measure similarity between networks or between individual nodes within networks. For example, given an email communications network within an enterprise, one may want to classify individuals according to their functional roles, or given one individual, find another one playing a similar role.\nComputing network similarity requires going beyond comparing networks at a node level to measuring their structural similarity. To characterize network structure, traditional approaches extract features such as node degrees, clustering coefficients, eigenvalues, the lengths of shortest paths and so on [Berlingerio et al., 2012; Henderson et al., 2012; Gilpin et al., 2013]. However, these hand-crafted features are usually heterogeneous and it is often not clear how to integrate them within a learning framework. In addition, some graph features, such as eigenvalues, are computationally expensive and do not scale well in tasks involving large networks. Recent advances in distributed representation of nodes [Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Grover and Leskovec, 2016] in networks created an alternate\nframework for unsupervised feature learning of nodes in networks. These methods are based on the idea of preserving local neighborhoods of nodes with neural network embeddings. An objective is defined on the proximity between nodes in exploring the network neighborhood with various strategies, mainly Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The objective is optimized using single layer neural network for efficient training. However, the embeddings used for feature representation limit scope to the local context of nodes, without directly exploiting the global context of the network. To represent the whole network, these approaches require us to integrate the representations of all nodes, for example, by averaging their representations. However, not all nodes contribute equally to the global representation of the network, and in order to account for their varying importance, aggregation schemes need to weigh nodes, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the learning task.\nTo address above-mentioned challenge we describe a neural network algorithm called Network Vector, which learns distributed representations of networks that account for their global context. The algorithm is scalable to real world networks with large numbers of nodes and can be applied to generic networks such as social networks, knowledge graphs, and citation networks. Networks are compressed into realvalued vectors that preserve the network structure, so that the learned distributed representations can be used to effectively measure network similarity. Specifically, given two networks, even those with different size and topology, the distance between the learned vector representations can be used to measure their structural similarity. In addition, this approach allows us to compare individual nodes by looking at the similarity of their ego-networks, i.e., networks that contain the focal node and all their neighbors and connections between them.\nOur approach is inspired by Paragraph Vector [Le and Mikolov, 2014] that learns distributed representations of texts of variable length such as sentences and documents [Le and Mikolov, 2014]. By exchanging the notions of ordered “word” sequences in sentences and “nodes” in paths along edges on networks. We learn network representations in a similar way of learning representations of sentences and documents. Specifically, we sample sequences of nodes from a network using random walks, same as in [Perozzi et al., 2014; Grover and Leskovec, 2016]. In contrast to existing ap-\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n02 44\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.S I]\n7 S\nep 2\n01 7\nproaches, the likelihood of next node in a random walk sequence predicted by our algorithm depends not only on the previous nodes, but also on the global context of the network. The global context vector representation of the network is learned to maximize the average predicted likelihood of nodes in random walk sequences sampled from the network. The learned representations can be used as the signatures of the networks for comparison, or as features for classification and other predictive tasks.\nWe evaluate the algorithm on several real world datasets from a diversity of domains, including citation network of knowledge concepts in Wikipedia, email interaction network, legal citations network, social network of bloggers, proteinprotein interaction network and language network. We focus on predictive tasks including role discovery in networks that aims to identify individual nodes serving similar roles, inference of analogous relations between concept pairs in Wikipedia and multi-label node classification. We compare Network Vector with state-of-the-art feature learning algorithm node2vec [Grover and Leskovec, 2016], LINE [Tang et al., 2015], DeepWalk [Perozzi et al., 2014] and featurebased baselines such as node degrees, clustering coefficients and eigenvalues. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Network Vector, due to its capacity of learning the global context of the network.\nIn summary, our contributions are summarized as follows:\n1. We propose Network Vector algorithm, a distributed feature learning algorithm for representing an entire network and its nodes simultaneously. We define an objective function that preserves the local neighborhood of nodes and the global context of the entire network.\n2. We evaluate Network Vector on role discovery, concept analogy and node multi-label classification tasks. Experiments on several benchmark datasets from diverse domains show its effectiveness and efficiency."

      "text" : "Our algorithm builds its foundation on learning distributed representations of concepts [Hinton, 1986] . Distributed representations encode structural relationships between concepts and are typically learned using back-propagation through neural networks. Recent advances in natural language processing have successfully adopted distributed representation learning and introduced a family of neural language models [Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b] to model word sequences in sentences and documents. These approaches embed words such that words in similar contexts tend to have similar representations in latent space.\nBy exchanging the notions of nodes in a network and words in a document, recent research [Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2015; Grover and Leskovec, 2016] attempt to learn node representations in a network in a similar way of learning word embeddings in neural language models. Our work follows this line of approaches in which nodes in a neighborhood will have similar embeddings in vector space. Different node sampling strategies are explored\nfor characterizing the neighborhood structure. For example, DeepWalk [Perozzi et al., 2014] samples node sequences from a network using a stream of short first-order random walks, and model them just like word sequences in documents using neural embeddings. LINE [Tang et al., 2015] samples nodes in pairwise manner and model the first-order and second-order proximity between them. GrapRep [Cao et al., 2015] extends LINE to exploit structural information beyond second-order proximity. To offer a flexible node sampling scheme, node2vec [Grover and Leskovec, 2016] utilizes second-order random walks, and combines Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategies to explore the local neighborhood structure.\nHowever, existing approaches only consider the local network structures (i.e., the neighborhoods of nodes) in learning node embeddings, but exploit little information of the global structure of the network. Although recent approach GrapRep [Cao et al., 2015] attempts to capture long distance relationship between two different nodes, it limits scope to a fixed number of hops. More importantly, existing approaches focus on node representations, and it requires additional effort to compute the representation of the entire network. The simple scheme of averaging the representations of all nodes to represent the network is by no means a good choice as it ignores the statistics of node frequency and their roles in the network. In contrast, we introduce a notion called the global network vector, which aims to represent the structural properties of an entire network. The global vector representation of the network acts as a memory which is asked to contribute to the prediction of a node accompanying with the node’s neighbors, and updated to maximize the predictive likelihood. As a result, our algorithm can simultaneously learn the global representation of a network and the representations of nodes in the network. This is inspired by Paragraph Vector [Le and Mikolov, 2014], which learns a continuous vector to represent a piece of text with variable-length, such as sentences, paragraphs and documents."

Let G = {V,E} denote a graph, and V is the set of vertices and E = V × V is the set of edges with weights W . The goal of our approach is to map the entire graph to a low-dimensional vector, represented by vG ∈ Rd, and map each node i to a unique vector vi ∈ Rd in the same vector space. Although the dimensionality of network representation vG can be different from that of node representations vi in theory, we adopt the same dimensionality d for the ease of computation in real world applications. Suppose that there are M graphs given (e.g., ego-networks of M persons of interest in a social network) and N distinct nodes in the corpus, then there are (M +N)× d parameters to be learned."

      "text" : "Our approach of modeling networks is motivated by learning distributed representations of variable-length texts, e.g., sentences and documents [Le and Mikolov, 2014]. The concept of “words” in a document [Le and Mikolov, 2014] is\nreplaced by “nodes” in a network in our modeling. The goal is to predict a node given other nodes in its local context as well as the global context of the network. Text has a linear property that the local context of a word can be naturally defined by surrounding words in ordered sequences. However, networks are not linear. In order to characterize the local context of a node, without loss of generality, we sample node sequences from the given network with second-order random walks in [Grover and Leskovec, 2016], which offer a flexible notion of a node’s local neighborhood by combining Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategies. Our learning framework can easily adopt higherorder random walks, but with higher computation cost. Each random walk starts from an arbitrary root node and generates an ordered sequence of nodes with second-order Markov chains. Specifically, consider node va that has been visited in the previous step, and the random walk currently reaches node vb. Consecutively, the next node vc will be sampled in random walks, with probability:\nP (vc|va, vb) = 1\nZ MabcWbc (1)\nwhere Mabc is the unweighted transition probability of moving from node vb to vc given va, Wbc is the weight of edge (vb, vc), and Z is the normalization term. We define Mabc as:\nMabc =  1 p if d(va, vc) = 0 1 if d(va, vc) = 1 1 q if d(va, vc) = 2\n(2)\nwhere d(va, vc) is the shortest path distance between va and vc. The parameters p and q control how the random walk biases toward visited nodes in previous step and nodes that are further away. The random walk terminates when l vertices are sampled, and the procedure repeats r times for each root node.\nFigure 1 illustrates a neural network architecture for learning the global network vector and node vectors simultaneously. A sliding window (v1, · · · , vn) with fixed-length n\nis repeatedly sampled over node sequences. The algorithm predicts the target node vn given preceding nodes v1:n−1 as local context and the entire network G as the global context, with probability P (vn|v1:n−1, G). Formally, the probability distribution of a target node is defined as:\nP (vn|v1:n−1;G) = 1\nZc exp[−E(G, v1:n−1; vn)] (3) where Zc = ∑\nvm∈V exp[−E(G, v1:n−1; vm)] is the normalization term. We extend the scalable version of Log-Bilinear model [Mnih and Hinton, 2007], called vector Log-Bilinear model (vLBL) [Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013]. In our model, the energy function E(G, v1:n−1; vn) is specified as:\nE(G, v1:n−1; vn) = −v̂>vn (4) where v̂ is the predicted representation of the target node:\nv̂ = vG + ( n−1∑ i=1 ci vi ) (5)\nHere denotes the Hadamard (element-wise) product, and ci is the weight vector for the context node in position i. ci parameterizes the context nodes at different hops away from the target node in random walks. The global network vector vG is shared across all sliding windows of node sequences. After being trained, the global network vector preserves the structural information of the network, and can be used as feature input for the network. In our model, in order to impose symmetry in feature space of nodes, and activate more interactions between the feature vector vG and the node vectors, we use the same set of feature vectors for both the target nodes and the context nodes. This is different from [Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013], where two separated sets of representations are used for the target node and the context nodes respectively. In practice, we find our approach improves the performance of Network Vector."

The computation involves the normalization term and is proportional to the number of distinct nodes N . The complexity of computation is expensive and impractical in real applications. In our approach, we adopt negative sampling [Mikolov et al., 2013b] for optimization. Negative sampling represents a simplified version of noise contrastive estimation [Mnih and Teh, 2012], and trains a logistic regression to distinguish between data samples of vn from “noise” distribution. Our objective is to maximize\nlog σ(v̂>vn) + k∑ m=1 Evm ∼ Pn(v) [ log σ(−v̂>vm) ] (7)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) is the sigmoid function. Pn(v) is the global unigram distribution of the training data acting as the noise distribution where we draw k negative samples of nodes. Negative sampling allows us to train our model efficiently that no longer requires explicitly normalized in Eq. (6), and hence are more scalable."

The energy function E(G; vt) is:\nE(G; vt) = −v>Gvt (9)\nThis architecture is a counterpart of the Distributed Bag-ofWords version of Paragraph Vector [Le and Mikolov, 2014]. However, this architecture ignores the order of the nodes in the sliding window and perform poorly in practice when it is used alone. We extend the framework by simultaneously training network and node vectors using a Skipgram [Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b] like model. The model additionally maximizes the likelihood of observing the local context vt−n:t+n (excluding vt) for the target node vt, conditioned on the feature representation of vt. Unfortunately, modeling the joint distribution of a set of context nodes is not tractable. This problem can be relaxed by assuming the node in different context positions are conditionally independent given the target word:\nP (vt−n:t+n|vt) = t+n∏\ni=t−n P (vi|vt) (10)\nwhere P (vi|vt) = 1Zt exp[−E(vt; vi)].

For each node sequence of fixed length l, we start from a randomly chosen root node. At each step, the walk visits a new node based on the transition probabilities P (vc|va, vb) in Eq. (1). The transition probabilities P (vc|va, vb) can be precomputed and stored in memory usingO(|E|2/|V |) space. Sampling a new node in the walk can be efficiently done inO(1) time using alias sampling [Walker, 1977]. The overall time complexity is O(r|V |l) for repeating r times of random walks of fixed length l by taking each node as root.\nThe time complexity of optimization with negative sampling in Eq. (7) is proportional to the dimensionality of vectors d, the length of context window n and the number of negative samples k. It takes O(dnk) time for nodes within the sliding window (v1, · · · , vn). The introduced global vector vG requires O(dk) time to optimize, same as any other node vectors in the sliding window.

The relevant part v>Gvn is related logarithmically to the probability P (vn|v1:n−1;G). Therefore, the more frequently a particular vn is observed in the data, the larger the value v>Gvn will have, and hence vG will be closer to vn in vector space. The training objective is to maximize the logarithm of the product of all probabilities P (vn|v1:n−1;G), and the value is related to v>Gv̄n, where v̄n is the expected vector that can be obtained by averaging all observed vn in the data.

We use the inverse architecture to train the vectors. Figure 2 shows the output of\nour method in two dimensional space. We use green circles to denote nodes and orange circle to denote the entire graph. The size of a node is proportional to its degree in the graph.

These could be groundbreaking works that serve to open new fields of discourse in science and law, or foundational works that span disciplines but have less of an impact on discourse, such as “methods” papers in science.\nFor the purpose of case study, we collected a large digitized record of federal court opinions from the CourtListener project1. The most cited legal decisions from the United States Supreme Court are selected and ego-networks of citations are constructed for these legal cases. Two distinct graph patterns are observed. One is “Citations have a few giant hubs” and “Citations are well connected”. We list a few examples in Table 1, where the titles of the cases with different citation patterns are colored as red and blue, respectively. The ego-networks of the first six cases listed in Table 1 have just a few giant hubs which are linked by many other cases. For example, the case “Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976)” is a landmark decision in American campaign finance law. The case “Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 (1939)” is a landmark decision centered on the Child Labor Amendment, which was proposed for ratification by Congress in 1924. These cases are generally centered on a specific topic, and their citations may have a narrowed topic. There are only a few hubs cited frequently by others and the citations generally do not cite each other. On the other side, the ego-networks of the last six cases listed in Table 1 have citations that are well connected. For example, “Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) ” was the first case where the United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner; The case “Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931)” is a landmark in the history of First Amendment constitutional law to include a protection of the substance of the First Amendment. These cases are influential in the history and cited by many diverse subsequent legal decisions, which usually cite each other.\nOur Network Vector algorithm is used to learn twodimensional embeddings from the ego-networks of the legal cases, and their projections are shown as open dots in the right figure of Table 1. The structures of the ego-networks for four sampled Supreme Court legal cases (Case IDs: 110578, 93272,101957,105547) are also illustrated in the figure. Note that the ego network includes the case itself (does not show in the figure), and all the cases it cites (smaller circle on the right) as well as all the cases that cite it (larger circle on the left). Lines represent citations among these cases. The two groups of ego-networks contrast each other. Compared to the\n1https://www.courtlistener.com/\nego-networks in red boxes, which is cited by unrelated legal cases, there is clearly more coherence in discourse related to the cases in blue boxes, as indicated by citations among other Supreme Court cases that cite this one. Although the differences between these two ego-networks could be captured in a standard way, by features related to the degree distribution of the ego-networks, or their clustering coefficients, the distinctions between other ego-networks may be more subtle necessitating a new approach for evaluating their similarity. In this representation, the position of the case in the learned space captures the similarity of the structure of their ego-networks. Cases that are more similar to the ego-networks in red boxes fall in the top half of the 2-D plane (red open dots); while cases similar to those in blue boxes fall in the bottom half (blue open dots). Thus, distances between the learned representations of the ego-networks of legal cases can be used to quantitatively capture their similarity."

The edge weight is defined by the cooccurrence of two words within a 2-length slide window. The Part-of-Speech (POS) tags [Marcus et al., 1993] inferred using the Stanford POS-Tagger [Toutanova et al., 2003] are used as labels.

      "heading" : "Methods for Comparison",
      "text" : "We compare the node representations learned by Network Vector against the following feature learning methods for node representations: • Spectral clustering [Tang and Liu, 2011]: This method\nlearns the d-smallest eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian matrix, and utilize them as the ddimensional feature representations for nodes.\n• DeepWalk [Perozzi et al., 2014]: This method learns d-dimensional feature representations using Skipgram [Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b] from node sequences, that are generated by uniform random walks from the source nodes on graph.\n• LINE [Tang et al., 2015]: This method learns ddimensional feature representations by sampling nodes at 1-hop and 2-hop distance from the source nodes in BFS-like manner.\n• node2vec [Grover and Leskovec, 2016]: We use the original node2vec algorithm with optimal parameter settings of (p, q) reported in [Grover and Leskovec, 2016].\nNetwork Vector utilizes only first-order or second-order proximity between nodes in two-layer neural embedding framework. The first layer computes the context feature vector, and the second layer computes the probability distribution of target nodes. It is similar to other neural embedding based feature learning methods DeepWalk, LINE and node2vec. For fair comparison, we exclude recent approaches GraRep [Cao et al., 2015], HNE [Chang et al., 2015] and SDNE [Wang et al., 2016]. It is because GraRep utilizes information from network neighborhoods beyond second-order proximity, and both HNE and SDNE employ deep neural networks that have multiple layers (more than two). GraRep, HNE and SDNE are less computational efficient and cannot scale well, as compared to DeepWalk, LINE, node2vec\nand our algorithm Network Vector. For fair comparison, we use the inverse architecture of Network Vector, which is Skip-gram [Mikolov et al., 2013a] like and similar to that of node2vec. The parameter settings for Network Vector are in favor of node2vec, and exactly the same as in [Grover and Leskovec, 2016]. Specifically, we set d = 128, r = 10, l = 80, and a context size n = 10, and are aligned with typical values used for DeepWalk and LINE. A single pass of the data (one epoch) is used for optimization. In order to perform multi-label classification, the learned node representations from each approach are used as feature input to a one-vs-rest logistic regression with L2 regularization. Our experiments are repeated for 10 random equal splits of train and test data, and average results are reported."

      "heading" : "Results",
      "text" : "Macro-F1 scores are used as evaluation metrics, and Table 4 shows the results. We run Network Vector with node sequences generated by biased random walks from node2vec. The default parameter setting (p = 1, q = 1) used in DeepWalk and the optimal parameter setting of node2vec reported in [Grover and Leskovec, 2016] are used.\nFrom the results, we can see Network Vector outperforms node2vec using the same biased random walks, and DeepWalk using the same uniform random walks. It is evident that the global representation of the entire network allows Network Vector to exploit the global structure of the networks to learn better node representations. Network Vector achieves a slight performance gain, 1.0% over node2vec, and a significant 12.4% gain over DeepWalk on BlogCatalog. As we can see on PPI, The gain of Network Vector over node2vec and DeepWalk are significant and similar, 9.6% and 9.7% respectively. In the case of Wikipedia word cooccurrence network, Network Vector outperforms node2vec with a decent margin, achieving 13.7% performance gain, while with a less gain, 8.9% over DeepWalk. Overall, sampling strategies even with optimal parameter settings (p, q) in node2vec are limited in exploration of local neighborhood of the source nodes, but cannot exploit the global network structure well. Network Vector overcomes the limitation of locality. By utilizing an additional global vector to memorize the collective information from all the local neighborhoods of nodes even within 2- hops, Network Vector learns improved node representations."
    }, {
      "heading" : "Parameter Sensitivity",
      "text" : "In order to understand how Network Vector improves in learning node representations with biased random walks in fine-grained settings, we evaluate performance while varying the parameter settings of (p, q). We fix p = ∞ to discourage revisiting sampled nodes at the previous step in random walks, and varying the value q in the range from 2−4 to 24 to perform DFS-like sampling in various degrees.\nFigure 3 shows the comparison results for Network Vector and ndoe2vec in both Macro-F1 and Micro-F1 scores. As we can see, Network Vector consistently outperforms node2vec in different parameter settings of q in all the three datasets. However, we observe on BlogCatalog, Network Vector achieves relatively larger gains over node2vec when q is large that the random walks is biased towards BFS-like sampling, as compared to that when q is small that the sampling is more DFS-like. It is mainly because when the random walks is biased towards nodes close to the source nodes, the global information of network structure that are exploited by Network Vector can compensate more for locality information using BFS-like sampling. However, when q is small, the random walks is biased towards sampling nodes far away from the source nodes, and explore information close to the global network structure. Hence, Network Vector is not quite\nhelpful in this case. We can see similar patterns of performance margin between Network Vector and node2vec when q tends to be large in word cooccurrence network of Wikipedia. However, in the case of PPI, the performance gains achieved by Network Vector over node2vec are stable even various values of q are used. The reason is probably because the biological states of proteins in a protein-protein interaction network exhibit a high degree of homophily, since proteins in local neighborhood usually organize together to perform similar functions. Hence, the global network structure is not quite informative to predict the biological states of proteins as we set a large value of q."

      "text" : "To see the effect of training data, we compare performance while varying the fraction of labeled data from 10% to 90%. Figure 4 shows the results on PPI. The parameters (p, q) is fixed using optimal values (4, 1). As we can see, when using more labeled data, the performance of node2vec and Network Vector generally increases. Network Vector achieves the largest gain over node2vec of 9.0% in Macro-F1 score and 10.3% at 40% labeled data. When only 10% labeled data is used, Network Vector only yields 1.5% gain in Macro-F1 score, and 7.1% in Micro-F1 score. We have similar observations on BlogCatalog and Wikipedia datasets, and the results are not shown."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have presented Network Vector, an algorithm for learning distributed representations of nodes and networks simultaneously. By embedding the network in a lower-dimensional vector space, our algorithm allows for quantitative comparison of networks. It also allows for the comparison of individual network nodes, since each node can be represented by its ego-network—a network containing the node itself, its network neighbors, and all connections between them.\nIn contrast to existing network embedding methods, which only learn representations of component nodes, Network Vector directly learns the representation of an entire network. Learning a representation of a network allows us to evaluate the similarity between two networks or two individual nodes, which enables us to answer questions that were difficult to address with existing methods. For instance, given a node in a network, for example, a manager within an organization, we can identify other people serving a similar role within that organization. Also, given a connection, denoting some relation-\nship between two people within a social network, we could find another pair in an analogous relationship. Beyond social networks, we can also answer new questions about knowledge networks that connect concepts or documents to each others, for example, Wikipedia and citations networks. This can be useful especially in cases where the contents of documents is not available for privacy or other reasons, but the network of interactions exists.\nFor the networks in which content is available for the nodes, the learning method could be extended to account for it. For example, for knowledge networks, the approach could be combined with text to learn representations of networks that will give a more fine-grained view of their similarity. Additionally, other non-textual attributes could also be included in the learning algorithm. The flexibility of such learning algorithms make them ideal candidates for applications requiring similarity comparison of different types of objects."

By embedding networks in a lowdimensional space, the algorithm allows us to compare networks in terms of structural similarity and to solve outstanding predictive problems. Unlike alternative approaches that focus on node level features, we learn a continuous global vector that captures each node’s global context by maximizing the predictive likelihood of random walk paths in the network. Our algorithm is scalable to real world graphs with many nodes. We evaluate our algorithm on datasets from diverse domains, and compare it with state-of-the-art techniques in node classification, role discovery and concept analogy tasks. The empirical results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of our algorithm.",
