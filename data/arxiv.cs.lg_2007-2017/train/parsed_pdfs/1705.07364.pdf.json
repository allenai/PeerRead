      "text" : "Adversarial neural networks solve many important problems in data science, but are notoriously difficult to train. These difficulties come from the fact that optimal weights for adversarial nets correspond to saddle points, and not minimizers, of the loss function. The alternating stochastic gradient methods typically used for such problems do not reliably converge to saddle points, and when convergence does happen it is often highly sensitive to learning rates. We propose a simple modification of stochastic gradient descent that stabilizes adversarial networks. We show, both in theory and practice, that the proposed method reliably converges to saddle points. This makes adversarial networks less likely to “collapse,” and enables faster training with larger learning rates."

      "text" : "Adversarial networks play an important role in a variety of applications, including image generation [43, 41], style transfer [3, 37, 41, 17], domain adaptation [37, 38, 12, 36], imitation learning [16], privacy [10, 1], fair representation [26, 10], etc. One particularly motivating application of adversarial nets is their ability to form generative models, as opposed to the classical discriminative models [14, 32, 8, 28].\nWhile adversarial networks have the power to attack a wide range of previously unsolved problems, they suffer from a major flaw: they are difficult to train. This is because adversarial nets try to accomplish two objectives simultaneously; weights are adjusted to maximize performance on one task while minimizing performance on another. Mathematically, this corresponds to finding a saddle point of a loss function - a point that is minimal with respect to one set of weights, and maximal with respect to another.\nConventional neural networks are trained by marching down a loss function until a minimizer is reached (Figure 1a). In contrast, adversarial training methods search for saddle points rather than a minimizer, which introduces the possibility that the training path “slides off” the objective functions and the loss goes to −∞ (Figure 1b), resulting in “collapse” of the adversarial network. As a result, many authors suggest using early stopping, gradients/weight clipping [2], or specialized objective functions [14, 45, 2] to maintain stability.\nIn this paper, we present a simple “prediction” step that is easily added to many training algorithms for adversarial nets. We present theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction method is asymptotically stable for a class of saddle point problems. Finally, we use a wide range of experiments to show that prediction enables faster training of adversarial networks using large learning rates without the instability problems that plague conventional training schemes.\n∗Equal contribution\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 36\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\n7"

Most authors use the alternating stochastic gradient method to solve saddle-point problems involving neural networks. This method alternates between updating u with a stochastic gradient descent step, and then updating v with a stochastic gradient ascent step. When simple/classical SGD updates are used, the steps of this method can be written\nuk+1 = uk − αkL′u(uk, vk) | gradient descent in u, starting at (uk, vk) vk+1 = vk + βkL′v(uk+1, vk) | gradient ascent in v, starting at (uk+1, vk) .\n(2)\nHere, {αk} and {βk} are learning rate schedules for the minimization and maximization steps, respectively.

      "text" : "We now discuss a few common adversarial network problems and their saddle-point formulations. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) fit a generative model to a dataset using a game in which a generative model competes against a discriminator [14]. The generator, G(z; θg), takes random noise vectors z as inputs, and maps them onto points in the target data distribution. The discriminator,\nD(x; θd), accepts a candidate point x and tries to determine whether it is really drawn from the empirical distribution (in which case it outputs 1), or fabricated by the generator (output 0). During a training iteration, noise vectors from a Gaussian distribution G are pushed through the generator network G to form a batch of generated data samples denoted by Dfake. A batch of empirical samples, Dreal, is also prepared. One then tries to adjust the weights of each network to solve a saddle point problem, which is popularly formulated as,\nmin θg max θd\nEx∼Dreal f(D(x; θd)) + Ez∼G f(1−D(G(z; θg); θd)). (4)\nHere f(.) is any monotonically increasing function. Initially, [14] proposed using f(x) = log(x).\nDomain Adversarial Networks (DANs) [25, 12, 10] take data collected from a “source” domain, and extract a feature representation that can be used to train models that generalize to another “target” domain. For example, in the domain adversarial neural network (DANN [12]), a set of feature layers maps data points into an embedded feature space, and a classifier is trained on these embedded features. Meanwhile, the adversarial discriminator tries to determine, using only the embedded features, whether the data points belong to the source or target domain. A good embedding yields better task-specific objective on target domain while fooling the discriminator, and is found by solving\nmin θf ,θyk max θd ∑ k αkLyk ( xs; θf , θyk ) − λLd (xs,xt; θf , θd) . (5)\nHere Ld is any adversarial discriminator loss function and Lyk denotes the task specific loss. θf , θd, and θyk are network parameter of feature mapping, discriminator, and classification layers."

      "text" : "It is well known that alternating stochastic gradient methods are unstable when using simple logarithmic losses. This led researchers to explore multiple directions for stabilizing GANs; either by adding regularization terms [2, 23, 5, 45], a myriad of training “hacks” [34, 15], re-engineering network architectures [45], and designing different solvers [27]. Specifically, the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [2] approach modifies the original objective by replacing f(x) = log(x) with f(x) = x. This led to a training scheme in which the discriminator weights are “clipped.” However, as discussed in [2], the WGAN training is unstable at high learning rates, or when used with popular momentum based solvers such as Adam. Currently, it is known to work well only with RMSProp [2].\nThe unrolled GAN [27] is a new solver that can stabilize training at the cost of more expensive gradient computations. Each generator update requires the computation of multiple extra discriminator updates, which are then discarded when the generator update is complete. While avoiding GAN collapse, this method requires increased computation and memory.\nIn the convex optimization literature, saddle point problems are more well studied. One popular solver is the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method [46, 11], which has been popularized by Chambolle and Pock [4], and has been successfully applied to a range of machine learning and statistical estimation problems [13]. PDHG relates closely to the method proposed here - it achieves stability using the same prediction step, although it uses a different type of gradient update and is only applicable to bi-linear problems.\nStochastic methods for convex saddle-point problems can be roughly divided into two categories: stochastic coordinate descent [7, 21, 44, 47, 48, 39, 35] and stochastic gradient descent [6, 31]. Similar optimization algorithms have been studied for reinforcement learning [40, 9]. Recently, a “doubly” stochastic method that randomizes both primal and dual updates was proposed for strongly convex bilinear saddle point problems [42]. For general saddle point problems, “doubly” stochastic gradient descent methods are discussed in [29, 30], in which primal and dual variables are updated simultaneously based on the previous iterates and the current gradients."

      "text" : "The standard alternating SGD switches between minimization and maximization steps. In this algorithm, there is a risk that the minimization step can overpower the maximization step, in which case the iterates will “slide off” the edge of saddle, leading to instability (Figure 1b). Conversely, an overpowering maximization step will dominate the minimization step, and drive the iterates to extreme values as well.\nThe effect of prediction is visualized in Figure 2. Suppose that a maximization step takes place starting at the red dot. Without prediction, the maximization step will be the same regardless of whether the previous minimization update was weak (Figure 2a) or strong (Figure 2b). Prediction allows the maximization step to exploit information about the minimization step. If the previous minimizations step was weak (Figure 2a), the prediction step (dotted black arrow) stays close to the red dot, resulting in a weak predictive maximization step (white arrow). But if we arrived at the red dot using a strong minimization step (Figure 2b), the prediction moves a long way down the loss surface, resulting in a stronger maximization step (white arrows) to compensate."

When exact (non-stochastic) gradient updates are used, the iterates follow the path of a simple dynamical system with closed-form solutions. We give here a sketch of this argument: a detailed derivation is provided in the Supplementary Material.\nWhen the (non-predictive) gradient method (2) is applied to the linear problem (6), the resulting iterations can be written\nuk+1 − uk α = −KT vk, v k+1 − vk α = (β/α)Kuk+1.\nWhen the stepsize α gets small, this behaves like a discretization of the system of differential equations\nu̇ = −KT v, v̇ = β/αKu where u̇ and v̇ denote the derivatives of u and v with respect to time. These equations describe a simple harmonic oscillator, and the closed form solution for u is\nu(t) = C cos(Σ1/2t+ φ)\nwhere Σ is a diagonal matrix, and the matrix C and vector φ depend on the initialization. We can see that, for small values of α and β, the non-predictive algorithm (2) approximates an undamped harmonic motion, and the solutions orbit around the saddle without converging.\nThe prediction step (3) improves convergence because it produces damped harmonic motion that sinks into the saddle point. When applied to the linearized problem (6), we get the dynamical system\nu̇ = −KT v, v̇ = β/αK(u+ αu̇) (7)\nwhich has solution\nu(t) = UA exp(− tα 2\n√ Σ) sin(t √ (1− α2/4)Σ + φ).\nFrom this analysis, we see that the damping caused by the prediction step causes the orbits to converge into the saddle point, and the error decays exponentially fast."

We now provide a rigorous convergence analysis that handles these issues.\nWe assume that the function L(u, v) is convex in u and concave in v. We can then measure convergence using the “primal-dual” gap, P (u, v) = L(u, v?)− L(u?, v) where (u?, v?) is a saddle. Note that P (u, v) > 0 for non-optimal (u, v), and P (u, v) = 0 if (u, v) is a saddle. Using these definitions, we formulate the following convergence result. The proof is in the supplementary material. Theorem 1. Suppose the function L(u, v) is convex in u, concave in v, and that the partial gradient L′v is uniformly Lipschitz smooth in u (‖L′v(u1, v)− L′v(u2, v)‖ ≤ Lv‖u1 − u2‖).

To make the problem interesting, we corrupt 70% of odd digits with salt-and-pepper noise, while we corrupt only 30% of even digits. When we train a LeNet network [22] on this problem, we find that the network encodes and uses information about the noise; when a noise vs no-noise classifier is trained on the deep features generated by LeNet, it gets 100% accuracy. The goal of this task is to force LeNet to ignore the noise when making decisions. We create an adversarial model of the form (5) in which Ly is a softmax loss for the even vs odd classifier. We make Ld a softmax loss for the task of discriminating whether the input sample is noisy or not. The classifier and discriminator were both pre-trained using the default LeNet implementation in Caffe [18]. Then the combined adversarial net was jointly trained both with and without prediction. For implementation details, see the Supplementary Material.\nFigure 3 summarizes our findings. In this experiment, we considered applying prediction to both the classifier and discriminator. We note that our task is to retain good classification accuracy while preventing the discriminator from doing better than the trivial strategy of classifying odd digits as noisy and even digits as non-noisy. This means that the discriminator accuracy should ideally be ∼ 0.7. As shown in Figure 3a, the prediction step hardly makes any difference when evaluated at the small learning rate of 10−4. However, when evaluated at higher rates, Figures 3b and 3c show that the prediction solvers are very stable while one without prediction collapses (blue solid line is flat) very early.

We consider an image modeling task using CIFAR-10 [20] on the recently popular convolutional GAN architecture, DCGAN [32]. We compare our predictive method with that of DCGAN and the unrolled GAN [27] using the training protocol described in [32]. Note that we compared against the unrolled GAN with stop gradient switch2 and K = 5 unrolling steps. All the approaches were trained for five random seeds and 100 epochs each.\nWe start with comparing all three methods using the default solver for DCGAN (the Adam optimizer) with learning rate=0.0002 and β1=0.5. Figure 4 compares the generated sample images (at the 100th epoch) and the training loss curve for all approaches. The discriminator and generator loss curves in Figure 4e show that without prediction, the DCGAN collapses at the 45th and 57th epochs. Similarly, Figure 4f shows that the training for unrolled GAN collapses in at least three instances. The training procedure using predictive steps never collapsed during any epochs. Qualitatively, the images generated using prediction are more diverse than the DCGAN and unrolled GAN images.\nFigure 5 compares all approaches when trained with 5× higher learning rate (0.001) (the default for the Adam solver). As observed in [32], the standard and unrolled solvers are very unstable and collapse at this higher rate. However, as shown in Figure 5d, & 5a, training remains stable when a predictive step is used, and generates images of reasonable quality. The training procedure for both DCGAN and unrolled GAN collapsed on all five random seeds. The results on various additional intermediate learning rates are in the Supplementary Material.\nIn the Supplementary Material, we present one additional comparison showing results on a higher momentum of β1=0.9 (learning rate=0.0002). We observe that all the training approaches are stable. However, the quality of images generated using DCGAN is inferior to that of the predictive and unrolled methods.\nOverall, of the 25 training settings we ran on (each of five learning rates for five random seeds), the DCGAN training procedure collapsed in 20 such instances while unrolled GAN collapsed in 14 experiments (not counting the multiple collapse in each training round). On the contrary, we find that our simple predictive step method collapsed only once.\nFinally note that prediction adds trivial cost to the training algorithm. Using a single TitanX Pascal, a training epoch of DCGAN takes 35 secs. With prediction, an epoch takes 38 secs. The unrolled GAN method, which requires extra gradient steps, takes 139 secs/epoch."

Similar to the domain adaptation task, the learning of each classifier can be formulated as a minimax problem in (5) [10, 26]. Unlike the previous example though, this task has a model selection component. From a pool of hundreds of randomly generated adversarial deep nets, for each value of t, one selects the model that maximizes the difference\nyt,Delta = yacc − t ∗ ydisc.

The person’s gender is chosen to be the sensitive variable. Details are in the supplementary. To demonstrate the advantage of using prediction for model selection, we follow the protocol developed in [10]. In this work, the search space is restricted to a class of models that consist of a fully connected autoencoder, one task specific discriminator, and one adversarial discriminator. The encoder output from the autoencoder acts as input to both the discriminators. In our experiment, 100 models are randomly selected. During the training of each adversarial model, Ld is a cross-entropy loss while Ly is a linear combination of reconstruction and cross-entropy loss. Once all the models are trained, the best model for each value of t is selected by evaluating (9) on the validation set.\nFigure 6a plots the results on the test set for the AFLR approach with and without prediction steps in their default Adam solver. For each value of t, Figure 6b, 6c also compares the number of layers in the selected encoder and discriminator networks.

      "text" : "Here, we provide a detailed derivation of the harmonic oscillator behavior of Algorithm (3) on the simple bi-linear saddle of the form\nL(x, y) = yTKx where K is a matrix. Note that, within a small neighborhood of a saddle, all smooth weakly convex objective functions behave like (6).To see why, consider a smooth objective function L with a saddle point at x∗ = 0, y∗ = 0. Within a small neighborhood of the saddle, we can approximate the function L to high accuracy using its Taylor approximation\nL(x, y) ≈ L(x∗, y∗) + yTL′xyx+O(‖x‖3 + ‖y‖3) where L′xy denotes the matrix of mixed-partial derivatives with respect to x and y. Note that the first-order terms have vanished from this Taylor approximation because the gradients are zero at a saddle point. The O(‖x‖2) and O(‖y‖2) terms vanish as well because the problem is assumed to be weakly convex around the saddle. Up to third-order error (which vanishes quickly near the saddle), this Taylor expansion has the form (6). For this reason, stability on saddles of the form (6) is a necessary condition for convergence of (3), and the analysis here describes the asymptotic behavior of the prediction method on any smooth problem for which the method converges.\nWe will show that, as the learning rate gets small, the iterates of the non-prediction method (2) rotate in orbits around the saddle without converging. In contrast, the iterates of the prediction method fall into the saddle and converge.\nWhen the conventional gradient method (2) is applied to the linear problem (6), the resulting iterations can be written\nxk+1 − xk α = −KT yk, y k+1 − yk α = (β/α)Kxk+1.\nWhen the stepsize α gets small, this behaves like a discretization of the differential equation\nẋ = −KT y (10) ẏ = β/αKx (11)\nwhere ẋ and ẏ denote the derivatives of x and y with respect to time.\nThe differential equations (10,11) describe a harmonic oscillator. To see why, differentiate (10) and plug (11) into the result to get a differential equation in x alone\nẍ = −KT ẏ = −β/αKTKx. (12) We can decompose this into a system of independent single-variable problems by considering the eigenvalue decomposition β/αKTK = UΣUT . We now multiply both sides of (12) by UT , and make the change of variables z ← UTx to get\nz̈ = −Σz. where Σ is diagonal. This is the standard equation for undamped harmonic motion, and its solution is z = A cos(Σ1/2t + φ), where cos acts entry-wise, and the diagonal matrix A and vector φ are constants that depend only on the initialization. Changing back into the variable x, we get the solution\nx = UA cos(Σ1/2t+ φ).\nWe can see that, for small values of α and β, the non-predictive algorithm (2) approximates an undamped harmonic motion, and the solutions orbit around the saddle without converging.\nThe prediction step (3) improves convergence because it produces damped harmonic motion that sinks into the saddle point. When applied to the linearized problem (6), the iterates of the predictive method (3) satisfy\nxk+1 − xk α = −KT yk yk+1 − yk α = β/αK(xk+1 + xk+1 − xk) = β/αKxk+1 + βKx k+1 − xk α .\nFor small α, this approximates the dynamical system\nẋ = −KT y (13) ẏ = β/αK(x+ αẋ).

The solutions have the form z(t) = A exp(− tα2 √ Σ) sin(t √ (1− α2/4)Σ + φ). Changing back to the variable x, we see that the iterates of the original method satisfy\nx(t) = UA exp(− tα 2\n√ Σ) sin(t √ (1− α2/4)Σ + φ).\nwhere A and φ depend on the initialization.\nFrom this analysis, we see that for small constant α the orbits of the lookahead method converge into the saddle point, and the error decays exponentially fast."

(35) Lipschitz smoothness is used for (31); the prediction step in (3) is used for (32); the primal update in (3) is used for (33); bounded assumptions are used for (35).\nSince L(u, v) is concave in v, we have 〈L′v(uk, vk), vk − v?〉 ≤ L(uk, vk)− L(uk, v?).

For simplicity, let us consider a task (T1) of classifying into odd and even numbered images. Let say, that∼ 50% of data instances were corrupted using salt and pepper noise of probability 0.2 and this distortion process was biased. Specifically, only 30% of even numbered images were distorted as against the 70% of odd-numbered images. We have observed that any feature representation network θf trained using the binary classification loss function for task T1 has noise bias also encoded within it. This was verified by training an independent noise classifier on the learned features. This lead us to design of simple adversarial network to “unlearn” the noise bias from the feature learning pipeline. We formulate this using the minimax objective in (5).\nIn our model, Ld is a softmax loss for the task (T2) of classifying whether the input sample is noisy or not. Ly is a softmax loss for task T1 and λ = 1. A LeNet network [22] is considered for training on task T1 while a two-layer MLP is used for training on task T2. LeNet consist of two convolutional (conv) layers followed by two fully connected (FC) layers at the top. The parameters of conv layers form θf while that of FC and MLP layers forms θy and θd respectively. We train the network in three stages. Following the training on task T1, θf were fixed and MLP is trained independently on task T2. The default learning schedule of LeNet implementation in Caffe [18] were followed for both the tasks. The total training iterations on each task were set to 10000. After pretraining, the whole network is jointly finetuned using the adversarial approach. (5) is alternatively minimized w.r.t. θf , θy and maximize w.r.t. θd. The predictive step were only used during the finetuning phase.\nOur finding is summarized in 3. In addition, Figure 7 provides neck-to-neck comparison of two popular solvers Adam and SGD using predictive step. Not surprisingly, the Adam solver shows\nrelatively better performance and convergence even with an additional predictive step. This also suggests that the default hyper-parameter for the Adam solver can be retained and utilized for training this networks without resorting to any further hyper-parameter tuning (as it is currently in practice)."

OFFICE is a small scale dataset consisting of images collected from three distinct domains: AMAZON, DSLR and WEBCAM. For such a small scale dataset, it is non-trivial to learn features from images of a single domain. For instance, consider the largest subset AMAZON, which contains only 2,817 labeled images spread across 31 different categories. However, one can leverage the power of domain adaptation to improve cross domain accuracy. We follow the protocol listed in [12] and the same network architecture is used. Caffe [18] is used for implementation. The training procedure from [12] is kept intact except for the additional prediction step. In table 1 comparisons are drawn with respect to target domain accuracy on three pairs of source-target domain tasks. The test accuracy is reported at the end of 50,000 training iterations."

The two dimensional data is sampled from the mixture of eight gaussians with their means equally spaced around the unit circle centered at (0, 0). The standard deviation of each gaussian is set at 0.01. The two dimensional latent vector z is sampled from the multivariate gaussian. The generator and discriminator network consists of two fully connected hidden layers, each with 128 hidden units and tanh activations. The final layer of the generator has linear activation while that of discriminator has sigmoid activation. The solver optimizes both the discriminator and the generator network using the objective in (4). We use adam\nsolver with their default parameter and with input batch of size 512.

These difficulties come from the fact that optimal weights for adversarial nets correspond to saddle points, and not minimizers, of the loss function. The alternating stochastic gradient methods typically used for such problems do not reliably converge to saddle points, and when convergence does happen it is often highly sensitive to learning rates. We propose a simple modification of stochastic gradient descent that stabilizes adversarial networks. We show, both in theory and practice, that the proposed method reliably converges to saddle points. This makes adversarial networks less likely to “collapse,” and enables faster training with larger learning rates.",
