This paper exhibits an interesting class of constraint sets in which order of magnitude reasoning is demonstrably fast. Specifically, we present a polynomial-time algorithm that can solve a set of constraints of the form 'Points a and b are much closer together than points c and d.' We prove that this algorithm can be applied if `much closer together' is interpreted either as referring to an infinite difference in scale or as referring to a finite difference in scale, as long as the difference in scale is greater than the number of variables in the constraint set. We also prove that the first-order theory over such constraints is decidable.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:47:48 GMT  (143kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5448v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["e davis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5448"}
