      "text" : "As of February 2017 the W3C Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) [5] is under development by the W3C Data Shapes Working Group. The design document for SHACL, Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), as of this time is available at https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-shacl-20170202/\nSHACL is divided into two parts, SHACL Core and SHACL-SPARQL. SHACL Core has two separate specifications; a complete normative specification in text and a partial informative specification as a mapping to an extension of SPARQL [4]. The specification via a mapping to SPARQL uses a version of pre-binding defined in SHACL. The use of pre-binding has caused continual problems in SHACL. Sometimes the definition of pre-binding produces many constructs whose mapping specification diverges from the text specfication. Sometimes, including now, the definition of pre-binding has problems making it unsuitable for use in all or part of SHACL. The text specification of SHACL Core suffers from a lack of rigour, resulting in a specification that can be read in multiple ways.\nSHACL-SPARQL depends on a mapping to SPARQL that has the same problems as the partial mapping for SHACL Core but the mapping is normative for SHACL-SPARQL.\nThe syntax of SHACL Core is unnecessarily complex and fragile. Certain constructs can be used in some places but not in other very simlar places. There are constructs that are limited versions of other constructs. There are multiple influences on how certain constructs behave.\nThis document contains a specification for ASHACL, an alternative version of the validating portion of SHACL Core using many parts of the specification of SHACL Core [5].\nThe major syntax difference between ASHACL and the current version of SHACL Core is to unify the various kinds of shapes in SHACL Core into a single notion of a shape. The single property sh:path then controls how to determine value nodes. This results in a simpler and more uniform language.\nAnother significant difference is how validation results and reports are defined. This eliminates the problematic procedural dependencies in SHACL Core and correctly specifies what needs to be contained in a validation report.\nA third significant difference is the removal of the informative SPARQL specifications for many SHACL Core constructs. This eliminates the informative dependency on pre-binding as well as removing a source of divergence in the specification.\nThe specification of ASHACL here is in text form with dependence on only a few SPARQL functions. The specification of ASHACL here has been carefully constructed to be precise and well-defined, eliminating the problems with imprecise and poorly constructed parts of the current specification of SHACL.\nBecause ASHACL is a variant of SHACL, much of the desgin of ASHACL here is taken fromd SHACL [5]. Some of the wording here has as source wording in Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) [5]."

Terminology that is linked to portions of SPARQL 1.1 Query Language [4] is used in ASHACL as defined there. A single linkage is sufficient to provide a definition for all occurrences of a particular term in this document.\nDefinitions are complete within this document, i.e., if there is no rule to make a some situation true in this document then the situation is false. Definitions, or partial definitions, have the phrase being defined in bold. Some definitions are dispersed throughout the document. For these terms each portion of the definition has the phrase being defined in bold.\nProperty: A property is an IRI. Value: An RDF term n has value v for property p in an RDF graph G if there\nis an RDF triple in G with subject n, predicate p, and object v. An RDF term n has value v for SPARQL property path expression p in an RDF graph G if there is a solution mapping in the result of the SPARQL query SELECT ?s ?o WHERE { ?s p′ ?o } on G that binds ?s to n and ?o to v, where p′ is SPARQL surface syntax for p. Path: A path in an RDF graph G from RDF term n to RDF term m is a finite sequence of RDF triples in G such that the subject of the first RDF triple is n, the object of the last RDF triple is m, and the object of each RDF triple except the last is the subject of the next. ASHACL List: AnASHACL list in an RDF graphG is an IRI or a blank node that is either rdf:nil (provided that rdf:nil has no value for either rdf:first or rdf:rest in G), or has exactly one value for rdf:first in G and exactly one value for rdf:rest in G that is also an ASHACL list in G and there is no non-empty path in G from the list back to itself where the predicates of the RDF triples in the path are each rdf:rest.\nThe members of any ASHACL list except rdf:nil in an RDF graph G consist of its value for rdf:first in G followed by the members in G of its value for rdf:rest in G. The ASHACL list rdf:nil has no members in any RDF graph. ASHACL Instance and ASHACL Type: An RDF term n is an ASHACL instance of an RDF termm in an RDF graphG if there is a path in G from n to m where the predicate of the first RDF triple in the path is rdf:type and the predicates of any other RDF triples in the path are rdfs:subClassOf.\nAn RDF term n has an RDF term m as ASHACL type in an RDF graph G if n is an ASHACL instance of m in G.\nData Graph: A data graph is any RDF graph."

If the potential shapes graph is recursive the behaviour of the processor is not fully defined here; the processor MAY report a failure if the potential shapes graph is recursive or MAY extend this specification. The behavior of an ASHACL processor MUST satisfy all the requirements in this document regardless of whether the the potential shapes graph is recursive or not.\nUnless the ASHACL processor reports a failure, it MUST either return a representation, or a location from which a representation can be retrieved, for an RDF graph that is a validation report for the validation of the data graph\nagainst the shapes graph. The representation can be a document in a syntax for RDF graphs, such as Turtle, or an RDF graph stored in a graph repository.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide a version of the above interface where the representation of the validation report is a file containing a Turtle document.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide an interface similar to the first interface above except that the return value of the interface is a boolean indicating whether the data graph conforms to the shapes graph.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide versions of the above interfaces where the potential shapes graph is formed by starting with an initial graph and merging in other graphs accessible at locations that are values of RDF triples with predicate owl:imports in the potential shapes graph being formed.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide versions of the above interfaces where the potential shapes graph is formed by accessing locations that are objects of RDF triples with predicate sh:shapesGraph in the data graph and merging the RDF graphs available at these locations into an initial graph or potential shapes graph.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide versions of the above interfaces where the data graph is the result of using owl:imports as above starting with some initial data graph or where the data graph is the result of performing inference according to the inferences required in one or more SPARQL entailment regimes [3] specified as the objects of RDF triples in the shapes graph with predicate sh:entailment starting with an initial data graph.\nAn ASHACL processor SHOULD provide two extra versions of each interface above that it provides. The first of these takes in addition an IRI and validates or checks conformance with respect to the data graph and the IRI as a shape in the shapes graph. The second of these takes in addition also an IRI or RDF literal and validates or checks conformance with respect to the IRI or RDF literal using the data graph and the IRI as a shape in the shapes graph.\nIf an ASHACL processor accesses any persistent representation of any graph that contributes to the data graph or the potential shapes graph the ASHACL processor MUST NOT change these representations.
