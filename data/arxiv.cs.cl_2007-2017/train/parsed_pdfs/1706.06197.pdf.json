      "text" : "Neural network learning is typically slow, where back propagation usually dominates the computational cost during the learning process. Back propagation entails a high computational cost because it needs to compute full gradients and update all model parameters in each learning step. It is not uncommon for a neural network to have a massive number of model parameters.\nIn this study, we propose a minimal effort back propagation method, which we call meProp, for neural network learning. The idea is that we compute only a very small but critical portion of the gradient information, and update only the corresponding minimal portion of the parameters in each learning step. This leads to sparsified gradients, such that only highly relevant parameters are updated and other pa-\n1School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China 2MOE Key Laboratory of Computational Linguistics, Peking University, China.

The sparsified back propagation leads to a linear reduction in the computational cost.\nTo realize our approach, we need to answer two questions. The first question is how to find the highly relevant subset of the parameters from the current sample in stochastic learning. We propose a top-k search method to find the most important parameters. Interestingly, experimental results demonstrate that we can update only 1–4% of the weights at each back propagation pass. This does not result in a larger number of training iterations. The proposed method is general-purpose and it is independent of specific models and specific optimizers (e.g., Adam and AdaGrad).\nThe second question is whether or not this minimal effort back propagation strategy will hurt the accuracy of the trained models. We show that our strategy does not degrade the accuracy of the trained model, even when a very small portion of the parameters is updated. More interestingly, our experimental results reveal that our strategy actually improves the model accuracy in most cases. Based on our experiments, we find that it is probably because the minimal effort update does not modify weakly relevant parameters in each update, which makes overfitting less likely, similar to the dropout effect.\nThe contributions of this work are as follows:\n• We propose a sparsified back propagation technique for neural network learning, in which only a small\nsubset of the full gradient is computed to update the model parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that we can update only 1–4% of the weights at each back propagation pass. This does not result in a larger number of training iterations.\n• Surprisingly, our experimental results reveal that the accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved,\nrather than degraded. We demonstrate this effect by conducting experiments on different deep learning models (LSTM andMLP), various optimizationmethods (Adam and AdaGrad), and diverse tasks (natural language processing and image recognition)."

For simplicity, we take a computation unit with one linear transformation and one non-linear transformation as an example:\ny = Wx (1)\nz = σ(y) (2)\nwhere W ∈ Rn×m, x ∈ Rm, y ∈ Rn, z ∈ Rn, m is the dimension of the input vector, n is the dimension of the output vector, and σ is a non-linear function (e.g., relu, tanh, and sigmoid). During back propagation, we need to compute the gradient of the parameter matrix W and the input vector x:\n∂z\n∂Wij = σ\n′ ix T j (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m) (3)\n∂z ∂xi =\n∑\nj\nWTijσ ′ j (1 ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ i ≤ m) (4)\nwhere σ ′ i ∈ R n means ∂zi\n∂yi . We can see that the computa-\ntional cost of back propagation is directly proportional to the dimension of output vector n.\nThe proposedmeProp uses approximate gradients by keeping only top-k elements based on the magnitude values. That is, only the top-k elements with the largest absolute values are kept. For example, suppose a vector v = 〈1, 2, 3,−4〉, then top2(v) = 〈0, 0, 3,−4〉. We denote the indices of vector σ ′\n(y)’s top-k values as {t1, t2, ..., tk}(1 ≤ k ≤ n), and the approximate gradient of the parameter matrixW and input vector x is:\n∂z\n∂Wij ← σ\n′ ix T j if i ∈ {t1, t2, ..., tk} else 0 (5)\n∂z\n∂xi ←\n∑\nj\nWTijσ ′ j if j ∈ {t1, t2, ..., tk} else 0 (6)\nAs a result, only k rows or columns (depending on the layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction (k divided by the vector dimension) in the computational cost.\nFigure 1 is an illustration of meProp for a single computation unit of neural models. The original back propagation uses the full gradient of the output vectors to compute the gradient of the parameters. The proposed method selects the top-k values of the gradient of the output vector, and backpropagates the loss through the corresponding subset of the total model parameters.\nAs for a complete neural network framework with a loss L, the original back propagation computes the gradient of the parameter matrixW as:\n∂L ∂W = ∂L ∂y · ∂y ∂W (7)\nwhile the gradient of the input vector x is:\n∂L ∂x = ∂y ∂x · ∂L ∂y (8)\nThe proposed meProp selects top-k elements of the gradient ∂L ∂y to approximate the original gradient, and passes\nthem through the gradient computation graph according to the chain rule. Hence, the gradient ofW goes to:\n∂L ∂W ← topk( ∂L ∂y ) · ∂y ∂W (9)\nwhile the gradient of the vector x is:\n∂L ∂x ← ∂y ∂x · topk( ∂L ∂y ) (10)\nFigure 2 shows an illustration of the computational flow of meProp. The forward propagation is the same as traditional forward propagation, which computes the output vector via a matrix multiplication operation between two input tensors. The original back propagation computes the full gradient for the input vector and the weight matrix. For meProp, back propagation computes an approximate gradient by keeping top-k values of the backward flowed gradient and masking the remaining values to 0.\nFigure 3 further shows the computational flow of meProp for the mini-batch case."

We use the optimizers with automatically adaptive learning rates, including Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) and AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011). In our implementation, we make no modification to the optimizers, although there are many zero elements in the gradients.\nMost of the experiments on CPU are conducted on the framework coded in C# on our own. This framework builds a dynamic computation graph of the model for each sample, making it suitable for data in variable lengths.

      "heading" : "2.2.1. WHERE TO APPLY MEPROP",
      "text" : "The proposed method aims to reduce the complexity of the back propagation by reducing the elements in the computationally intensive operations. In our preliminary observations, matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication consumed more than 90% of the time of back propagation. In our implementation, we apply meProp only to the back propagation from the output of the multiplication to its in-\nputs. For other element-wise operations (e.g., activation functions), the original back propagation procedure is kept, because those operations are already fast enough compared with matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication operations.\nIf there are multiple hidden layers, the top-k sparsification needs to be applied to every hidden layer, because the sparsified gradient will again be dense from one layer to another. That is, in meProp the gradients are sparsified with a top-k operation at the output of every hidden layer.\nWhile we apply meProp to all hidden layers using the same k of top-k, usually the k for the output layer could be different from the k for the hidden layers, because the output layer typically has a very different dimension compared with the hidden layers. For example, there are 10 tags in the MNIST task, so the dimension of the output layer is 10, and we use an MLP with the hidden dimension of 500. Thus, the best k for the output layer could be different from that of the hidden layers.\n2.2.2. CHOICE OF TOP-k ALGORITHMS\nInstead of sorting the entire vector, we use the well-known min-heap based top-k selection method, which is slightly changed to focus on memory reuse. The algorithm has a\ntime complexity of O(n log k) and a space complexity of O(k)."

Tollenaere (1990) also proposed an adaptive acceleration strategy for back propagation. Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is proposed to improve training speed and reduce the risk of overfitting. Sparse coding is a class of unsupervised methods for learning sets of over-complete bases to represent data efficiently (Olshausen & Field, 1996). Ranzato et al. (2006) proposed a sparse autoencoder model for learning sparse over-complete features. The proposed method is quite different compared with those prior studies on back propagation, dropout, and sparse coding.\nThe sampled-output-loss methods (Jean et al., 2015) are limited to the softmax layer (output layer) and are only based on random sampling, while our method does not have those limitations. The sparsely-gated mixture-ofexperts (Shazeer et al., 2017) only sparsifies the mixtureof-experts gated layer and it is limited to the specific set-\nting of mixture-of-experts, while our method does not have those limitations. There are also prior studies focusing on reducing the communication cost in distributed systems (Seide et al., 2014; Dryden et al., 2016), by quantizing each value of the gradient from 32-bit float to only 1- bit. Those settings are also different from ours."

The evaluation metric is per-word accuracy. A popular model for this task is the LSTM model\n(Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997),1 which is used as our baseline.\nTransition-based Dependency Parsing (Parsing): Following prior work, we use English Penn TreeBank (PTB) (Marcus et al., 1993) for evaluation. We follow the standard split of the corpus and use sections 2-21 as the training set (39,832 sentences, 1,900,056 transition examples),2 section 22 as the development set (1,700 sentences, 80,234 transition examples) and section 23 as the final test set (2,416 sentences, 113,368 transition examples). The evaluation metric is unlabeled attachment score (UAS). We implement a parser using MLP following Chen and Manning (2014), which is used as our baseline.\nMNIST Image Recognition (MNIST): We use the MNIST handwritten digit dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) for evaluation. MNIST consists of 60,000 28×28 pixel training images and additional 10,000 test examples. Each image contains a single numerical digit (0-9).

As discussed in Section 2, the optimal k of top-k for the output layer could be different from the hidden layers, because their dimensions could be very different. For Parsing and MNIST, we find using the same k for the output and the hidden layers works well, and we simply do so. For another task, POS-Tag, we find the the output layer should use a different k from the hidden layers. For simplicity, we do not apply meProp to the output layer for POS-Tag, because in this task we find the computational cost of the output layer is almost negligible compared with other layers.\nThe hyper-parameters are tuned based on the development data. For the Adam optimization method, we find the default hyper-parameters work well on development sets, which are as follows: the learning rate α = 0.001, and β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ǫ = 1 × 10 −8.

      "text" : "In this experiment, the LSTM is based on one hidden layer and the MLP is based on two hidden layers (experiments on more hidden layers will be presented later). We conduct experiments on different optimization methods, including AdaGrad and Adam. Since meProp is applied to the linear transformations (which entail the major computational cost), we report the linear transformation related backprop time as Backprop Time. It does not include nonlinear activations, which usually have only less than 2% computational cost. The total time of back propagation, in-\ncluding non-linear activations, is reported as Overall Backprop Time. Based on the development set and prior work, we set the mini-batch size to 1 (sentence), 10,000 (transition examples), and 10 (images) for POS-Tag, Parsing, and MNIST, respectively. Using 10,000 transition examples for Parsing follows Chen and Manning (2014).\nTable 1 shows the results based on different models and different optimizationmethods. In the table,mePropmeans applying meProp to the corresponding baseline model, h = 500 means that the hidden layer dimension is 500, and k = 20 means that meProp uses top-20 elements (among 500 in total) for back propagation. Note that, for fair comparisons, all experiments are first conducted on the development data and the test data is not observable. Then, the optimal number of iterations is decided based on the optimal score on development data, and the model of this iteration is used upon the test data to obtain the test scores.\nAs we can see, applying meProp can substantially speed up the back propagation. It provides a linear reduction in the computational cost. Surprisingly, results demonstrate that we can update only 1–4% of the weights at each back propagation pass. This does not result in a larger number of training iterations. More surprisingly, the accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved rather than decreased. The main reason could be that the minimal effort update does not modify weakly relevant parameters, which makes overfitting less likely, similar to the dropout effect.\nTable 2 shows the overall forward propagation time, the overall back propagation time, and the training time by summing up forward and backward propagation time. As we can see, back propagation has the major computational cost in training LSTM/MLP.\nThe results are consistent among AdaGrad and Adam. The results demonstrate that meProp is independent of specific optimization methods. For simplicity, in the following experiments the optimizer is based on Adam."

To examine this, we perform experiments on using the same hidden dimension as k, and the results are shown in Table 3. As we can see, however, the results of the small hidden dimensions are much worse than those of meProp.\nIn addition, Figure 4 (right) shows more detailed curves by varying the value of k. In the figure, different k gives different backprop ratio for meProp and different hidden dimension ratio for LSTM/MLP. As we can see, the answer to that question is negative: meProp does not rely on redundant hidden layer elements."

As we can see, meProp can achieve further improvement over dropout. In particular, meProp has an improvement of 0.46 UAS on Parsing. The results suggest that the type of overfitting that meProp reduces is probably different from that of dropout. Thus, a model should be able to take advantage of both meProp and dropout to reduce overfitting."

Table 5 shows that adding the number of hidden layers does not hurt the performance of meProp."

      "heading" : "4.8. Speedup on GPU",
      "text" : "For implementing meProp on GPU, the simplest solution is to treat the entire mini-batch as a “big training example”, where the top-k operation is based on the averaged values of all examples in the mini-batch. In this way, the big sparse matrix of the mini-batch will have consistent sparse patterns among examples, and this consistent sparse matrix can be transformed into a small dense matrix by remov-\ning the zero values. We call this implementation as simple unified top-k. This experiment is based on PyTorch.\nDespite its simplicity, Table 6 shows the good performance of this implementation, which is based on the mini-batch size of 50. We also find the speedup on GPU is less significant when the hidden dimension is low. The reason is that our GPU’s computational power is not fully consumed by the baseline (with small hidden layers), so that the normal back propagation is already fast enough,making it hard for meProp to achieve substantial speedup. For example, supposing a GPU can finish 1000 operations in one cycle, there could be no speed difference between a method with 100 and a method with 10 operations. Indeed, we find MLP (h=64) and MLP (h=512) have almost the same GPU speed even on forward propagation (i.e., without meProp), while theoretically there should be an 8x difference. With GPU, the forward propagation time of MLP (h=64) and MLP (h=512) is 572ms and 644ms, respectively. This provides evidence for our hypothesis that our GPU is not fully consumed with the small hidden dimensions.\nThus, the speedup test on GPU is more meaningful for the heavy models, such that the baseline can at least fully consume the GPU’s computational power. To check this, we test the GPU speedup on synthetic data of matrix multiplication with a larger hidden dimension. Indeed, Table 7 shows that meProp achieves much higher speed than the traditional backprop with the large hidden dimension. Furthermore, we test the GPU speedup on MLP with the large hidden dimension (Dryden et al., 2016). Table 8 shows that meProp also has substantial GPU speedup on MNIST with the large hidden dimension. In this experiment, the speedup is based on Overall Backprop Time (see the prior definition). Those results demonstrate that meProp can achieve\ngood speedup on GPU when it is applied to heavy models.\nFinally, there are potentially other implementation choices of meProp on GPU. For example, another natural solution is to use a big sparse matrix to represent the sparsified gradient of the output of a mini-batch. Then, the sparse matrix multiplication library can be used to accelerate the computation. This could be an interesting direction of future work."

This leads to very sparsified gradients to modify only highly relevant parameters for the given training sample. The proposed meProp is independent of the optimization method.

In back propagation, only a small subset of the full gradient is computed to update the model parameters. The gradient vectors are sparsified in such a way that only the top-k elements (in terms of magnitude) are kept. As a result, only k rows or columns (depending on the layout) of the weight matrix are modified, leading to a linear reduction (k divided by the vector dimension) in the computational cost. Surprisingly, experimental results demonstrate that we can update only 1–4% of the weights at each back propagation pass. This does not result in a larger number of training iterations. More interestingly, the accuracy of the resulting models is actually improved rather than degraded, and a detailed analysis is given.",
