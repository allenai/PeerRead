      "text" : "Automatic image description — the task of generating natural language sentences for an image — has thus far been exclusively performed in English, due to the availability of English datasets. However, the reasons for doing automatic image description, such as text-based image search or providing alt-texts for the visually impaired, also hold for other languages.\nCurrent image description models are not per se English-language specific, implying a straightforward approach to generating for a new language: collect new annotations and train a model for that language. However, the wealth of image description resources for English suggest a cross-language resource transfer approach, which is what we explore here. In other words: How can we best use resources for Language A when generating descriptions for Language B?\nIn this paper, we present a multilingual multimodal image description model. Multilingual image description can be viewed as a form of visually-grounded machine translation, in which parallel sentences are grounded against the image features. This grounding can be particularly useful when the source sentence contains ambiguities that need to be disambiguated in the target sentence. For example, Finnish pronouns are not gendered, so when translating “hän” to English, visual input could be vital to determine whether to generate “he” or “she”.\nOur multilingual multimodal language model extends a monolingual neural image description model (Vinyals et al., 2015) with features extracted from the source language, in an architecture similar to sequence-to-sequence machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). Figure 1 depicts the overall approach: a multimodal language model is used as a source language encoder. The representations learned by the source model are treated as fixed input, which acts as additional conditioning features\n∗Authors contributed equally to this paper.\nfor the multimodal target language decoder. We also study a number of sensible variants, such as using only linguistic source features in the encoder, or removing the image features in the decoder.\nIn a series of experiments on the IAPR-TC12 dataset of images described in English and German, we find that all models that use source features outperform monolingual image description models. The best English-language model improves upon the state-of-the-art by 2.3 BLEU4 points for this dataset. In the first results reported on German image description, our model achieves a 8.8 Meteor point improvement compared to a monolingual baseline. The implication is that linguistic and visual features offer orthogonal improvements in multi-modal modelling (a point also made by Silberer & Lapata (2014) and Kiela & Bottou (2014)). Models including visual features also improve over neural MT baselines, although to a lesser extent; this is likely due to the dataset being translations rather than independently elicited descriptions. Our analyses show that the additional features improve mainly lower-quality sentences, indicating that our best models successfully combine multiple noisy input modalities."

A nonlinear function f is applied to the embedding combined with the previous hidden state to generate the hidden state hi (Eqn 2).

We perform experiments using the standard splits of 17,665 images for training, from which we reserve 10% for hyperparameter estimation, and 1,962 for evaluation. We use only the first description of each image because in this dataset the different descriptions cover different aspects of the image. Note that the English descriptions are the originals; the German data was professionally translated from English. Figure 3 shows an example image-bitext tuple from the dataset.\nThe descriptions are lowercased and tokenised using the ptbtokenizer.py script from the MSCOCO evaluation tools1. All words in the training data observed fewer than 3 times are discarded.

It is known that language model perplexity is only weakly correlated with BLEU4 for MT (Auli et al., 2013), and that BLEU4 is only moderately correlated with human judgements for image description (Elliott & Keller, 2014). Here, we do early stopping for model selection based on BLEU4: if validation BLEU4 has not increased for 10 epochs, and validation language-model perplexity has stopped decreasing, training is halted.\nWe apply dropout over the image features, source features, and word representations with p = 0.5 to discourage overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). The objective function includes an L2 regularisation term with λ=1e−8.\nAll results reported are averages over three runs with different Glorot-style uniform weight initialisations (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). We report image description quality using BLEU4 (Papineni et al., 2002), Meteor (Denkowski & Lavie, 2014), and language-model perplexity. The BLEU4 and Meteor scores are calculated using MultEval (Clark et al., 2011)."

      "heading" : "4 RESULTS",
      "text" : "The results for image description in both German and English are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Example output can be seen in Figure 42. To our knowledge, these are the first published results for German image description. Overall, we note that image description in German results in lower BLEU4 and Meteor scores than English. This is most likely due to the more complex German morphology, which results in a larger vocabulary.\nThe baseline monolingual multimodal result for English (En-MLM) is in line to other state-of-theart models, which report results on the Flickr8K dataset. We obtain a BLEU4 score of 15.8 on the Flickr8K dataset, comparable to the 16.0 from Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2015), which uses an ensemble of models and beam search decoding. On the IAPR-TC12 dataset, the En MLM performs worse than Mao et al. (2015), but their model is trained and evaluated on all reference descriptions.\nAll multilingual models beat the monolingual image description baseline, by a margin of up to 8.9 BLEU4 and 8.8 Meteor points for the best models. The best model variant outperforms Mao et al. (2015) by 2.3 BLEU4. Recall that in this translation-type setting, the source features are produced from gold descriptions. Clearly this results in extremely useful features for the TARGET-LM or TARGET-MLM description generator, despite the switch in languages.\nThe neural MT baseline without visual features performs very well3. This indicates the effectiveness of the overall sequence-to-sequence approach, but is also an artifact of the dataset. A different dataset with independently elicited image descriptions (rather than translations of English descriptions) may result in worse performance for a pure MT system that is not visually grounded.\nOverall, the multilingual models that use a MLM to encode the source sentence outperform the SOURCE-LM models. On the target side, simple LM models perform better. To an extent this can be explained by the smaller number of parameters used in models that do not input the visual features twice, and it seems to be easier to incorporate the visual features on the source side, with fixed gold input. More generally, the MLM variants tend to be worse sentence generators than the LM models, indicating that while visual features lead to useful hidden state values, there is room for improving their role during generation."

      "heading" : "5 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Why is it useful to condition on source language features when generating descriptions? The initial step of a monolingual image description model is to ‘compress’ the image vector into the same number of dimensions as the hidden layer in the recurrent network. This can be thought of as distilling the image down to the essential features that correspond to the words in the description. If this step of the model is prone to mistakes, the resulting descriptions will be of poor quality. A model\n2Visit https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/d.elliott/GroundedTranslation/ to see the descriptions generated by each model variant for the validation data.\n3The BLEU4 and Meteor scores in Table 2 for En LM → De LM and En MLM → De LM are not significantly different according to the MultEval approximate randomization significance test.\nthat is also conditioned on a source feature vector have additional, and hopefully useful, evidence about how to describe the image.\nQualitatively, we can find evidence for this explanation using Barnes-Hut t-SNE projections of the initial hidden representations (van der Maaten, 2014). Figure 5 compares the t-SNE projection of an example from Figure 4 using a En MLM (left) and a De MLM → En MLM (right). In the monolingual example, the nearest neighbours of the target image are desert scenes with groups of people. If we condition on the source multimodalfeatures, the nearest neighbours are mountainous snowy images.\nWhen does it help to add a source description or an image? Figure 6 shows that the second input type (language or image features) is most helpful when the baseline model yields low quality descriptions. The additional modality adds useful information, resulting in increased sentence-BLEU4 scores. On the other hand, the additional input can also lower the quality of an already good baseline description. This risk seems to be higher when adding an image than when adding source language features, which is unsurprising given the larger distance between visual and linguistic space, versus moving from one language to another. This is also consistent with the lower performance of MLM baseline models compared to LM→LM models.\nSimilar analysis of the lower performing LM→MLM model (not shown) shows similar behaviour to the MLM→LM model above: the sentences with lower BLEU4 baseline scores (the vast majority) are improved by the additional features. However, for this model the decreasing performance starts earlier: the LM→MLM model is unable (on average) to improve sentences with lower baseline BLEU4 scores, particularly with regard to the LM→LM baseline. Adding the image features at the source side, rather than the target side, seems to filter out some of the noise and complexity of the image features, while the essential source language features are retained. Conversely, merging the source language features with image features on the target side, in the TARGET-MLM models, leads to a less helpful entangling of linguistic and (noisier) image input, which can’t be learned sufficiently well on our small dataset.\nThe examples in Figure 4 demonstrate that image and word features can also contribute additively to a good image description. The second picture showing people climbing up a snowface is described by the MLM model as grey rock but the MLM → MLM model correctly describes the scene type, based on the features extracted from the German example. In the third image, only the MLM → LM and LM → LM models produce accurate descriptions. The German descriptions are always good in this instance, but the English descriptions benefit from the extra source features."

      "heading" : "6 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "The past few years have seen numerous results showing how relatively standard neural network model architectures can be applied to a variety of tasks. The flexibility of the application of these architectures can be seen as a strong point, indicating that the representations learned in these general models are sufficiently powerful to lead to good performance. Another advantage, which we have exploited in the work presented here, is that it becomes relatively straightforward to make connections between models for different tasks, in this case image description and machine translation.\nDeep neural networks for automatic image description typically estimate a joint image-sentence representation in a multimodal recurrent neural network (RNN) (Kiros et al., 2014; Donahue et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2015; Karpathy & Fei-Fei, 2015; Mao et al., 2015). The main difference between these models and discrete tuple-based representations for image description (Farhadi et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2012; Elliott & Keller, 2013; Yatskar et al., 2014; Elliott & de Vries, 2015) is that it is not necessary to explicitly define the joint representation; the structure of the neural network can be used to estimate the optimal joint representation for the description task. As in our MLM, the image–sentence representation in the multimodal RNN is initialised with image features from the penultimate fully-connected layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained for multi-class object recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). Alternative formulations input the image features into the model at each timestep (Mao et al., 2015), or first detect the objects in an image and generate sentences using a maximum-entropy language model (Fang et al., 2015).\nIn the domain of machine translation, a greater variety of neural models have been used for subtasks within the MT pipeline, such as neural network language models (Schwenk, 2012) or joint translation and language models for re-ranking in phrase-based translation models (Le et al., 2012; Auli et al., 2013) or directly during decoding (Devlin et al., 2014).. More recently, end-to-end neural MT systems using Long Short-Term Memory Networks and Gated Recurrent Units have been proposed as Encoder-Decoder models for translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), and have proven to be highly effective (Bojar et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015).\nIn the multi-modal modelling literature, there are related approaches using visual and textual information to build representations for word similarity and word categorization tasks (Silberer & Lapata, 2014; Kiela & Bottou, 2014). Silberer & Lapata combine textual and visual modalities by jointly training stacked autoencoders, while Kiela & Bottou construct multi-modal representations by concatenating distributed linguistic and visual feature vectors. In both cases, the results show that the bimodal representations are superior to their unimodal counterparts."

      "heading" : "7 CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "In this paper we studied multi-language image description, the task of generating descriptions of an image given a corpus of parallel texts. The main difference between this task and monolingual image description is the availability of references in more than one language compared to multiple reference descriptions.\nImage description datasets typically include multiple reference sentences, which are essential for capturing linguistic diversity (Rashtchian et al., 2010; Elliott & Keller, 2013; Hodosh et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015). In our experiments, we have shown that useful image description diversity can be found in other languages instead of in multiple monolingual references. It is now an open question whether the benefits of multiple monolingual references extend to multiple multi-language references.\nOur approach to exploiting multiple-language training data essentially acts as an encoder-decoder model. The encoder captures a multimodal representation of the image and the source-language words, which is used as an additional conditioning vector for the decoder, which produces descriptions in the target language. This type of model significantly improves the quality of the descriptions in both directions compared to monolingual baselines.\nThe dataset used in this paper consists of translated descriptions, leading to high performance for the MT baseline. However, we believe that multilingual image description should be based on independently elicited descriptions in multiple languages, rather than literal translations. Linguistic and cultural differences may lead to very different descriptions being appropriate for different languages, in which case image features will provide stronger cues.\nIn the future, we plan to reframe the learning algorithm as a complete joint model over the image– source–target language, in order to update the source-language representations based on what we learn in the target language. It would also be interesting to explore attention-based recurrent neural networks, which have recently been used for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015) and image description (Xu et al., 2015). We would like to apply these models to other language pairs, such as the recently released PASCAL 1K Japanese Translations dataset containing professionally translated texts (Funaki & Nakayama, 2015). Lastly, applying these types of models to a multi-language video description dataset (Chen & Dolan, 2011) would be an exciting challenge."

To create a description of an image for a given target language, our sequence generation models condition on feature vectors from the image, the description from the source language, and/or a multimodal vector computed over the image and a description in the source language. In image description experiments on the IAPR-TC12 dataset of images aligned with English and German sentences, we find significant and substantial improvements in BLEU4 and Meteor scores for models trained over multiple languages, compared to a monolingual baseline.",
