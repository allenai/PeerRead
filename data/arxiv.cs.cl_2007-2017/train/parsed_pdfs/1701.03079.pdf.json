      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Automatic evaluation is crucial to the research of open-domain human-computer conversation systems. Nowadays, open-domain conversation is attracting increasing attention because of its wide applications (Bickmore and Picard, 2005; Bessho et al., 2012; Shang et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2016). In these studies, however, researchers typically resort to manual annotation to evaluate their models, which is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, automatic evaluation metrics are particularly in need, so as to ease the burden of model comparison and to promote further research on this topic.\nIn early years, traditional vertical-domain dialog systems use automatic metrics like slot-filling accuracy and goal-completion rate (Walker et al.,\n1997, 2001; Schatzmann et al., 2005). Unfortunately, such evaluation hardly applies to the open domain due to the diversity and uncertainty of utterances: “accurancy” and “completion,” for example, make little sense in open-domain conversation.\nPrevious studies in several language generation tasks have developed successful automatic evaluation metrics, e.g., BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) for machine translation, and ROUGE (Lin, 2004) for summarization. For conversation systems, researchers occassionally adopt these metrics for evaluation (Ritter et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Song et al., 2016). However, Liu et al. (2016) conduct extensive empirical experiments and show weak correlation between existing metrics and human annotation.\nVery recently, Lowe et al. (2017) propose a neural network-based metric for conversation systems; it learns to predict a score of a reply given its query (previous user-issued utterance) and a groundtruth reply. But such approach requires massive human-annotated scores to train the network, and thus is less flexible and extensible.\nIn this paper, we propose RUBER, a Referenced metric and Unreferenced metric Blended Evaluation Routine for open-domain dialog systems. RUBER has the following distinct features: • An embedding-based scorer measures the\nsimilarity between a generated reply and the groundtruth. We call this a referenced metric, because it uses the groundtruth as a reference, akin to existing evaluation metrics. Instead of using word-overlapping information (e.g., in BLEU and ROUGE), we measure the similarity by pooling of word embeddings (Forgues et al., 2014); it is more suited to dialog systems due to the diversity of replies. • A neural network-based scorer measures the\nrelatedness between the generated reply and\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n03 07\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Ja\nn 20\n17\n\uD835\uDC40 Bi-GRU RNN Query Reply\n\uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC5E, \uD835\uDC5F) Word Embedding C N N + M a xP o o li n g\nC N\nN + M a xP o o li n g\nEmbedding Extrema\nQuery\nGenerated Reply\nGroundtruth Reply\nNN Scorer\nBlending\nUnreferenced\nRUBER Metric\nReferenced \uD835\uDC5F\n\uD835\uDC5E\n\uD835\uDC5F\nReferenced Scorer\nQuery\nGenerated Reply\nGroundtruth Reply\nBlending\nRUBER Metric\n\uD835\uDC5F\n\uD835\uDC5E\n\uD835\uDC5F Unreferenced\nScorer\nWe evaluated RUBER on prevailing dialog systems, including both retrieval and generative ones.

      "heading" : "2.1 Referenced Metric",
      "text" : "We measure the similarity between a generated reply r̂ and a groundtruth r as a referenced metric. Traditional referenced metrics typically use wordoverlapping information including both precision (e.g., BLEU) and recall (e.g., ROUGE). As said, they may not be appropriate for open-domain dialog systems.\nWe adopt the vector pooling approach that summarizes sentence information by choosing the maximum and minimum values in each dimension; the closeness of a sentence pair is measured\n\uD835\uDC40\nBi-GRU RNN\nQuery\nReply\n\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC48(\uD835\uDC5E, \uD835\uDC5F)\nWord Embedding\nReferenced Scorer\nQuery\nGenerated Reply\nGroundtruth Reply\nBlending\nRUBER Metric\n\uD835\uDC5F\n\uD835\uDC5E\n\uD835\uDC5F Unreferenced\nScorer\nArxiv\nFigure 2: The neural network predicting the unreferenced score.\nby the cosine score. We use such heuristic matching because we assume no groundtruth scores, making it unfeasible to train a parametric model.\nFormally, let w1,w2, · · · ,wn be the embeddings of words in a sentence, max pooling summarizes the maximum value as\nvmax[i] = max { w1[i],w2[i], · · · ,wn[i] } (1)\nwhere [·] indexes a dimension of a vector. Likewise, min pooling yields a vector vmin. Because an embedding feature is symmetric in terms of its sign, we concatenate both max and min pooling vectors as v = [vmax;vmin].\nLet vr̂ be the generated reply’s sentence vector and vr be that of the groundtruth reply, both obtained by max and min pooling. The referenced metric sR measures the similarity between r and r̂ by\nsR(r, r̂) = cos(vr, v̂r̂) = v>r v̂r̂\n‖vr‖ · ‖v̂r̂‖ (2)\nNotice that the pooling approach tends to address uncommon words more than common ones. During unsupervised word embedding learning, common words’ vectors are pulled to the origin (near zero) because these words appear frequently in different contexts. Choosing the maximum and minimum values in each dimension extracts more information about uncommon words. Also, such treatment is more robust than vector extrema (Forgues et al., 2014); it chooses either the largest positive or smallest negative value, where features are more vulnerable to signs."

      "heading" : "2.2 Unreferenced Metric",
      "text" : "We then measure the relatedness between the generated reply r̂ and its query q. This metric is unreferenced and denoted as sU (q, r̂), because it does not refer to a groundtruth reply.\nDifferent from the r-r̂ metric, which mainly measures two utterances’ similarity, the q-r̂ metric in this part involves more semantics. Hence,\nwe empirically design a neural network (Figure 2) to predict the appropriateness of a reply with respect to a query.\nConcretely, each word in a query q and a reply r is mapped to an embedding; a bidirectional recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units (BiGRU RNN) captures information along the word sequence. The forward RNN takes the form\nrt = σ(Wrxt + Urh → t−1 + br) (3) zt = σ(Wzxt + Uzh → t−1 + bz) (4)\nh̃t = tanh ( Whxt + Uh(rt ◦ h→t−1) + bh ) (5) h→t = (1− zt) ◦ h→t−1 + zt ◦ h̃t (6)\nwhere xt is the current input, and h→t is the hidden state. Likewise, the backward RNN gives hidden states h←t . The last states of both directions are concatenated as the sentence embedding (q for a query and r for a reply).\nWe further concatenate q and r to match the two utterances. Besides, we also include a “quadratic feature” as q>Mr, where M is a parameter matrix.\nFinally, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) predicts a scalar score as our unreferenced metric sU . The hidden layer of MLP uses tanh as the activation function, whereas the last (scalar) unit uses sigmoid because we hope the score is bounded.\nThe above empirical structure is mainly inspired by several previous studies (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015; Yan et al., 2016). We may also apply other variants for utterance matching (Wang and Jiang, 2016; Mou et al., 2016); details are beyond the focus of this paper.\nTo train the neural network, we adopt negative sampling, which does not require human-labeled data. That is, given a groundtruth query reply pair, we randomly choose another reply, r−, in the training set as a negative sample. We would like the score of a positive sample to be larger than that of a negative sample by at least a margin ∆. The training objective is to minimize\nJ = max { 0,∆− sU (q, r) + sU (q, r−) } (7)\nAll parameters are trained by Adam with backpropagation.\nIn previous work, researchers adopt negative sampling for utterance matching (Yan et al., 2016). Our study further verifies that negative sampling is useful for the evaluation task, which eases the burden of human annotation compared with fully\nsupervised approaches that requirer manual labels for training their metrics (Lowe et al., 2017)."

      "heading" : "2.3 Hybrid Evaluation",
      "text" : "We combine the above two metrics by simple heuristics, resulting in a hybrid method RUBER for evaluating open-domain dialog systems.\nWe first normalize each metric to the range (0, 1), so that they are generally of the same scale. In particular, the normalization is given by\ns̃ = s−min(s′)\nmax(s′)−min(s′) (8)\nwhere min(s′) and max(s′) refer to the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of a particular metric.\nThen we combine s̃R and s̃U as our ultimate RUBER metric by heuristics including min, max, geometric averaging, and arithmetic averaging. As we shall see in Section 3.2, different strategies yield similar results, consistently outperforming baselines."

We performed Chinese word segmentation, and obtained Chinese terms as primitive tokens.\nThe RUBER metric (along with baselines) is evaluated on two dialog systems. One is a featurebased retrieval-and-reranking system in Song et al. (2016), which first retrieves a coarse-grained candidate set by keyword matching and then reranks the candidates by human-engineered features; the top-ranked results are selected for evaluation. The other is a sequence-to-sequence neural network (Bahdanau et al., 2015) that encodes a query as a vector with an RNN and decodes the vector\n1http://www.douban.com\nto a reply with another RNN; the attention mechanism is also applied to enhance query-reply interaction.\nWe had 9 volunteers to express their human satisfaction of a reply (either retrieved or generated) to a query by rating an integer score among 0, 1, and 2. A score of 2 indicates a “good” reply, 0 a bad reply, and 1 borderline."

      "heading" : "3.2 Results",
      "text" : "Table 1 shows the Pearson and Spearman correlation between the proposed RUBER metric and human scores; also included are various baselines. Pearson and Spearman correlation measures are widely used in other research of automatic metrics such as machine translation (Stanojević et al., 2015).\nWe find that the reference metric sR based on mebeddings is more correlated with human annotation than existing metrics including both BLEU and ROUGE, which are based on word overlapping information. This implies the groundtruth alone is useful for evaluating a candidate reply. But exact word overlapping is too strict in the dialog setting; embedding-based methods measure sentence closeness in a “soft” way.\nThe referenced metric sU also achieves high correlation, showing that the query alone is also informative2 and that negative sampling is useful for training evaluation metrics, although it\n2Technically speaking, a dialog generator is also aware of the query. However, a discriminative model (scoring a queryreply pair) is more easy to train than a generative model (synthesizing a reply based on a query). There could also be possibilities of generative adversarial training.\ndoes not requirer human annotation as labels. Our neural network scorer also outperforms the embedding-based cosine measure. This is because cosine mainly captures similarity, but the rich semantic relationship between queries and replies necessitates more complicated mechanisms like neural networks.\nWe combine the referenced and unreferenced metrics as the ultimate RUBER approach. Experiments show that choosing the larger value of sR and sU (denoted as max) is too lenient, and is slightly worse than other strategies. Choosing the smaller value (min) are averaging (either geometric or arithmetic mean) yield similar results. While the peak performance is not consistent in two experiments, they significantly outperforms both single metrics, showing the rationale of using a hybrid metric for open-domain dialog systems.\nWe further notice that our RUBER metric has near-human correlation. More importantly, all components in RUBER are heuristic or unsupervised. Thus, RUBER does not requirer human labels; it is more flexible than the existing supervised metric (Lowe et al., 2017), and can be easily adapted to different datasets."

However, there does not exist a standard automatic evaluation metric for open-domain dialog systems; researchers usually resort to human annotation for model evaluation, which is timeand labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose RUBER, a Referenced metric and Unreferenced metric Blended Evaluation Routine, which evaluates a reply by taking into consideration both a groundtruth reply and a query (previous user utterance). Our metric is learnable, but its training does not require labels of human satisfaction. Hence, RUBER is flexible and extensible to different datasets and languages. Experiments on both retrieval and generative dialog systems show that RUBER has high correlation with human annotation.",
