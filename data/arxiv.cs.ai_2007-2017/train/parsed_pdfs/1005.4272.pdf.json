However , the forecasting accuracy rates of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we compared our proposed new method of fuzzy time series forecasting with existing methods. Our method is based on means based partitioning of the historical data of car road accidents. The proposed method belongs to the kth order and time-variant methods. The proposed method can get the best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents than the existing methods.\nKeywords- Fuzzy sets, Fuzzy logical groups, fuzzified data, fuzzy\ntime series.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nForecasting activities play an important role in our daily life. During last two decades, various approaches have been developed for time series forecasting. Among them, ARMA models and Box-Jenkins model building approaches are highly famous. However, the classical time series methods can not deal with forecasting problems in which the values of time series are linguistic terms represented by fuzzy sets [11], [23]. Therefore, Song and Chissom [18] presented the theory of fuzzy time series to overcome this drawback of the classical time series methods. Based on the theory of fuzzy time series, Song et al. presented some forecasting methods [16], [18], [19], [20] to forecast the enrollments of the University of Alabama. In [1] Chen and Hsu and in [2], Chen presented a method to forecast the enrollments of the University of Alabama based on fuzzy times series. It has the advantage of reducing the calculation, time and simplifying the calculation process. In [8], Hwang, Chen and Lee used the differences of the enrollments to present a method to forecast the enrollments of the University of Alabama based on fuzzy time series. In [5] and [6], Huang used simplified calculations with the addition of heuristic rules to forecast the enrollments using [2].\nIn [4], Chen presented a forecasting methods based on highorder fuzzy time series for forecasting the enrollments of the University of Alabama. In [3], Chen and Hwang presented method based on fuzzy time series to forecast the daily temperature. In [15], Melike and Konstsntin presented a new first order time series model for forecasting enrollments of the University of Alabama. In [14], Li and Kozma presented a dynamic neural network method for time series prediction using the KIII model. In [21], Su and Li presented a method for fusing global and local information in predicting time series based on neural networks. In [22], Sullivan and Woodall reviewed the first-order time-variant fuzzy time series model and the first-order time-invariant fuzzy time series model presented by Song and Chissom[18], where their models are compared with each other and with a time-variant Markov model using linguistic labels with probability distributions. In [13], Lee, Wang and Chen presented two factor high order fuzzy time series for forecasting daily temperature in Taipei and TAIFEX. In [9], Jilani and Burney and in [10], Jilani, Burney and Ardil presented new fuzzy metrics for high order multivariate fuzzy time series forecasting for car road accident casualties in Belgium.\nIn this paper, we present a comparison of our proposed method and existing fuzzy time series forecasting methods to forecast the car road accidents in Belgium. Our proposed method belongs to the class of k-step first-order univariate time-variant method. The proposed method gives best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents when compared with existing methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section2, we briefly review some basic concepts of fuzzy time series. In Section 3, we present our method of fuzzy forecasting based on means of partitioning the car road accidents data. In Section 4, we compared the forecasting results of the proposed method with the existing methods. In section 5, we conclude the results.\n275 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nII BASIC CONCEPTS OF FUZZY TIME SERIES:\nThere are number of definitions for fuzzy time series. Definition 1: Imprecise data at equally spaced discrete time points are modeled as fuzzy variables. The set of this discrete fuzzy data forms a fuzzy time series.\nDefinition 2: Chronological sequences of imprecise data are considered as time series with fuzzy data. A time series with fuzzy data is refereed to as fuzzy time series.\nDefinition 3: Let Y(t), (t=...0,1,2,…) be the universe of\ndiscourse and Y(t) R . Assume that fi(t), i=1,2,… is defined in the universe of discourse Y(t) and F(t) is a collection of f(ti), ( i=...0,1,2,…), then F(t) is called a fuzzy time series of Y(t), i=1,2,..Using fuzzy relation, we define F(t)=F(t-1) o R(t,t-1) where R(t,t-1) is a fuzzy relation and “o” is the max min composition operator, then F(t) is caused by F(t-1) where F(t) and F(t-1) are fuzzy sets. Let F(t) be a fuzzy time series and let R(t, t-1) be a first order model of F(t). If R(t, t-1)=R(t1,t-2) for any time t then F(t) is called a time-invariant fuzzy time series. If R(t,t-1) is dependent on time t, that is, R(t, t-1) may be different from R(t-1,t-2) for any t, then F(t) is called a time-variant fuzzy time series.\nIII. PROPOSED METHOD USING FUZZY TIME SERIES:\nIn this section, we present our method to forecast the data of car road accidents based on means. The historical data of car road accidents are given in Table I. First, based on [1], we defined the partition the universe of discourse into equal length intervals. Then based on means of original data and means of frequency of interval data, we redefine the intervals. After this, define some membership function for each interval of the historical data to obtain fuzzy data to form a fuzzy time series. Then, it establishes fuzzy logical relationships (FLRs) based on the fuzzified data in Table IV. Finally, it uses our proposed method.\nStep 1: Define the universe of discourse U and partition it into four equal intervals u1,u2,u3,……un. For example, assume that the universe of discourse U=[900, 17000] is partitioned into four even and equal length intervals.\nStep 2: Get a mean of the original data. Get the means of frequency of each interval. Compare the means of original and frequency of each interval and then split the four interval into number of sub-interval respectively.\nStep 3: Define each fuzzy set Ai based on the re-divided intervals and fuzzify the historical data shown in Table I, where fuzzy set Ai denotes a linguistic value of the accident data represented by a fuzzy set. We have used triangular membership function to define the fuzzy sets Ai [10]. The reason for fuzzifying the accident data into fuzzified data is to translate crisp values into fuzzy sets to get a fuzzy time series.\nStep 4: Establish fuzzy logical relationships based on the fuzzified data where the fuzzy logical relationship “Ap, Aq, Ar\n-> As “ denotes that “if the fuzzified data of year p, q and r are Ap, Aq and Ar respectively, then the fuzzified data of the year ( r) is Ar”.\n1+0.5\n---------------------- if j=1,\n(1/ a1 ) +(0.5/ a2 )\n0.5 + 1 + 0.5\n--------------------------------------- if 2 <= j <= n-2\ntj = (0.5/ aj-1 ) +( 1/ aj ) + (0.5/ aj+1 )\n0.5 + 1\n----------------------- if j= n\n(0.5/an-1)+ (1/ an )\nwhere aj-1,aj, aj+1 are the mid points of the fuzzy intervals\nAj-1, Aj, Aj+1 respectively. Based on the fuzzify historical enrollments obtained in step 3, we can get the fuzzy logical relationship group (FLGR) as shown in Table IV.\nDivide each interval derived in step 2 into subintervals of equal length with respect to the corresponding means of the interval. We have assumed twenty nine partitions of the universe of discourse of the main factor fuzzy time series. Assuming that 0 ≠ Ai, for every Ai, i=1,2,…29.\nTABLE – I\nYEARLY CAR ACCIDENTS FROM 1974 TO 2004 IN BELGIUM ---------------------------------------------------------------------\nYear Killed Year Killed\n2004 953 1984 1,369 2003 1,035 1983 1,479 2002 1,145 1982 1,464 2001 1,288 1981 1,564 2000 1,253 1980 1,616 1999 1,173 1979 1,572 1998 1,224 1978 1,644 1997 1,150 1977 1,597 1996 1,122 1976 1,536 1995 1,228 1975 1,460 1994 1,415 1974 1,574 1993 1,346 1992 1,380 1991 1,471 1990 1,574 1989 1,488 1988 1,432 1987 1,390 1986 1,456 1985 1,308\n276 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nIn the following Table V summarizes the forecasting results of the proposed method from 1974 to 2004, where the universe of discourse is divided into twenty nine intervals based on means based partitioning. In the following, we use the average forecasting error rate (AFER) and mean square error (MSE) to compare the forecasting results of different forecasting methods, where Ai denotes the actual value and Fi\ndenotes the forecasting value of year (i), respectively.\n| Ai – Fi | / Ai AFER = ------------------ * 100 %\nn\nn ∑ ( Ai – Fi ) 2\ni=1\nMSE = --------------------\nn\nIn Table VI, we compare the forecasting results of the\nproposed method with that of the existing methods. From Table III, we can see that when the number of intervals in the universe of discourse is twenty nine intervals are sub partitioned base on means, the proposed method shows smallest values of the MSE and AFER of the forecasting results as compared to other methods of fuzzy time series forecasting. That is, the proposed method can get a higher forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting car road accidents that the existing methods.\nTABLE IV\nTHIRD ORDER FUZZY LOGICAL RELATIONSHIP GROUPS\nGroup 1: X1,X3,X7 -> X6\nGroup 2: X3,X7,X6 -> X4\nGroup 3: X7,X6,X4 -> X5\nGroup 4: X6,X4,X5 -> X3\nGroup 5: X4,X5,X3 -> X2\nGroup 6: X5,X3,X2 -> X5\nGroup 7: X3,X2,X5 -> X15\nGroup 8: X2,X5,X15 -> X10\nGroup 9: X5,X15,X10 -> X13\nGroup 10: X15,X10,X13 -> X19\nGroup 11: X10,X13,X19 -> X24\nGroup 12: X13,X19,X24 -> X20\nGroup 13: X19,X24,X20 -> X16\nGroup 14: X24,X20,X16 -> X13\nGroup 15: X20,X16,X13 -> X18\nGroup 16: X16,X13,X18 -> X8\nGroup 17: X13,X18,X8 -> X12\nGroup 18: X18,X13,X12 -> X19\nGroup 19: X13,x12,x19, -> X18\nGroup 20: X12,X19,X18 -> X23\n277 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nGroup 21: X19,X18,X23 -> X26\nGroup 22: X18,X23,X26 -> X24\nGroup 23: X23,X26,X24 -> X27\nGroup 24: X26,X24,X27 -> X22\nGroup 25: x24,X27,X22 -> X18\nGroup 26: X27,X22,X18 -> X24\nTABLE -V\nYears\nActual Values\nAi\nMid\nValues of\nInterval\nCalculated\nValues\nFi\n(Ai-Fi) 2\n| Ai -Fi|\n-------\nAi\n2004 953 1,000.0000 1,036.0825 6,902.7051 0.0872\n2003 1035 1,000.0000 1,036.0825 1.1718 0.0010\n2002 1145 1,150.0000 1,149.5167 20.4008 0.0039\n2001 1288 1,283.3335 1,280.7594 52.4263 0.0056\n2000 1253 1,250.0002 1,249.5555 11.8643 0.0027\n1999 1173 1,183.3335 1,182.8638 97.2940 0.0084\n1998 1224 1,216.6667 1,216.2100 60.6847 0.0064\n1997 1150 1,150.0000 1,149.5167 0.2336 0.0004\n1996 1122 1,116.6667 1,092.7141 857.6633 0.0261\n1995 1228 1,216.6667 1,216.2100 139.0050 0.0096\n1994 1415 1,415.3848 1,415.3013 0.0908 0.0002\n1993 1346 1,338.4617 1,338.3732 58.1686 0.0057\n1992 1380 1,384.6155 1,384.5300 20.5212 0.0033\n1991 1471 1,476.9233 1,476.8433 34.1437 0.0040\n1990 1574 1,577.7776 1,577.6211 13.1123 0.0023\n1989 1488 1,492.3079 1,493.0643 25.6474 0.0034\n1988 1432 1,430.7695 1,430.6868 1.7246 0.0009\n1987 1390 1,384.6155 1,384.5300 29.9206 0.0039\n1986 1456 1,461.5388 1,461.4578 29.7872 0.0037\n1985 1308 1,307.6924 1,305.2928 7.3287 0.0021\n1984 1369 1,369.2310 1,369.1444 0.0209 0.0001\n1983 1479 1,476.9233 1,476.8433 4.6515 0.0015\n1982 1464 1,461.5388 1,461.4578 6.4630 0.0017\n1981 1564 1,555.5554 1,555.3967 74.0163 0.0055\n1980 1616 1,622.2219 1,622.0697 36.8413 0.0038\n1979 1572 1,577.7776 1,577.6211 31.5967 0.0036\n1978 1644 1,644.4441 1,644.2939 0.0864 0.0002\n1977 1597 1,599.9998 1,599.8455 8.0966 0.0018\n1976 1536 1,533.3333 1,533.1722 7.9962 0.0018\n1975 1460 1,461.5388 1,461.4578 2.1251 0.0010\n1974 1574 1,577.7776 1,577.6211 13.1123 0.0023\nMSE = 275.77 AFER = 0.658643 %\nComparison of Proposed Method [Arul], Mr. Jillani and Mr. Lee\nYear Actual\nValues Jillani Lee Arul\n2004 953 995 1000 1036\n2003 1035 995 1000 1036\n2002 1145 1095 1100 1149\n2001 1288 1296 1300 1280\n2000 1253 1296 1300 1249\n1999 1173 1196 1200 1182\n1998 1224 1196 1200 1216\n1997 1150 1196 1200 1149\n1996 1122 1095 1100 1092\n1995 1228 1396 1400 1216\n1994 1415 1296 1300 1415\n1993 1346 1396 1400 1338\n1992 1380 1497 1500 1384\n1991 1471 1497 1500 1476\n1990 1574 1497 1500 1577\n1989 1488 1396 1400 1493\n1988 1432 1396 1400 1430\n1987 1390 1497 1500 1384\n1986 1456 1296 1300 1461\n1985 1308 1396 1400 1305\n1984 1369 1497 1500 1369\n1983 1479 1497 1500 1476\n1982 1464 1497 1500 1461\n1981 1564 1497 1500 1555\n1980 1616 1497 1500 1622\n1979 1572 1497 1500 1577\n1978 1644 1497 1500 1644\n1977 1597 1497 1500 1599\n1976 1536 1497 1500 1533\n1975 1460 1497 1500 1461\n1974 1574 1497 1500 1577\n278 http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\nMeasurement Jilani Lee Proposed MSE 6908.61 6850.38 275.77 AFER 5.061793 5.067887 0.658643\nIn this paper, we have presented means based partitioning of the historical accident data of the Belgium.

Most of the fuzzy time series methods are presented for forecasting of car road accidents. However , the forecasting accuracy rates of the existing methods are not good enough. In this paper, we compared our proposed new method of fuzzy time series forecasting with existing methods. Our method is based on means based partitioning of the historical data of car road accidents. The proposed method belongs to the kth order and time-variant methods. The proposed method can get the best forecasting accuracy rate for forecasting the car road accidents than the existing methods.
