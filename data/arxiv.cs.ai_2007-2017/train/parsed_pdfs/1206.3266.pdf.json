      "text" : "Markov decision processes (MDPs) [19] are an established framework for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Unfortunately, traditional methods for solving MDPs, such as value and policy iteration, are unsuitable for solving real-world problems. These problems are generally structured, and their state and action spaces are represented by state and action variables. The size of these problems is naturally exponential in the number of the variables, and so are their exact solutions. Approximate linear programming (ALP) [21] has emerged as a promising approach to solving these problems efficiently [6, 12, 15].\nThe main idea of this method is to approximate the optimal value function by a set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming (LP). The optimization can be performed in a structured manner [10, 20]. The structure is a result of combining the structure of factored MDPs and linear value function approximations.\nThe complexity of computing exact ALP solutions [10, 20] is exponential in the treewidth of the dependency graph that\nrepresents the constraint space in ALP. Therefore, when the treewidth of an ALP is large, its exact solution is infeasible. This type of problems can be still solved approximately using Monte Carlo constraint sampling [7, 14]. This approach can be interpreted as an outer approximation to the feasible region of the ALP.\nIn this work, we propose inner approximations to the feasible region. In comparison to the standard ALP formulation, the constraint space is factored into a set of subspaces. This structure allows for solving the new LP more efficiently. In particular, its constraints can be satisfied in a compact form without an exponential dependence on the treewidth of the original constraint space. We investigate both practical and theoretical aspects of the approach. In addition, we demonstrate that the approach yields an exponential speedup over ALP.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, we review factored MDPs [5] and linear value function approximations [2, 22]. Second, we discuss in detail existing work on approximate linear programming. Third, we propose a novel partitioned ALP formulation and study its properties. Finally, we evaluate the quality of the approximation on decision problems with more than 2100 states."

      "text" : "Many real-world decision problems are naturally described in a factored form. Factored MDPs [5] allow for a compact representation of this structure.\nA factored MDP [5] is a 4-tuple M = (X,A, P,R), where X = {X1, . . . ,Xn} is a state space represented by a set of state variables, A = {a1, . . . , am} is a finite set of actions1, P (X′ | X,A) is a transition function, which represents the dynamics of the MDP, andR is a reward function assigning immediate payoffs to state-action configurations. The state of the system is completely observed and given by a vector of value assignments x = (x1, . . . , xn).\n1For simplicity of exposition, we consider an MDP model with a single action variableA. Our ideas straightforwardly generalize to MDPs with factored action spaces [11].\nTransition model: The transition model is represented by a conditional probability distribution P (X′ | X,A), where X andX′ denote the state variables at two successive time steps. Since the full tabular representation of P (X′ | X,A) is infeasible when the number of state variables is large, we assume that the distribution factors alongX′ as:\nP (X′ | X, a) =\nn∏\ni=1\nP (X ′i | Par(X ′ i), a) (1)\nand is described compactly by a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) [8]. The network reflects independencies among the variables X and X′ given an action a. One-step dynamics of every state variable is given by its conditional probability distribution P (X ′i | Par(X ′ i), a), where Par(X ′ i)⊆X is the parent set of X ′i . The parent set is usually a small subset of state variables which simplifies the parameterization of the model.\nReward model: The reward model is factored similarly to the transition model. Specifically, the reward function:\nR(x, a) = ∑\nj\nRj(xj , a) (2)\nis an additive function of local reward functions defined on the subsetsXj and A. These local functions are compactly represented by reward nodes Rj , which are conditioned on their parent sets Par(Rj) = Xj ∪ A.\nOptimal value function and policy: The quality of a policy π is measured by the infinite horizon discounted reward E[ ∑∞ t=0 γ\ntrt], where γ ∈ [0, 1) is a discount factor and rt is the immediate reward at the time step t. In such a setting, there always exists an optimal policy π∗ which is stationary and deterministic [19]. The policy is greedy with respect to the optimal value function V ∗, which is a fixed point of the Bellman equation [1]:\nV ∗(x) = max a\n[ R(x, a) + γEP (x′|x,a)[V ∗(x′)] ] . (3)\nSimilarly to the above equation, all expectation terms in the rest of the paper are written compactly as EP (x)[f(x)]."

      "text" : "The major problem in solving ALP formulations efficiently is in satisfying their constraints. This problem is hard since the number of the constraints is exponential in the number of state variables. Fortunately, the constraints exhibit some structure. The structure is a result of combining linear value function approximations (Equation 4) with factored reward and transition models (Equations 1 and 2). Therefore, ALP\nconstraints can be satisfied in a structured form and without being enumerated exhaustively.\nBased on these observations, Guestrin et al. [10] proposed a variable elimination method [9] that rewrites the constraint space compactly. Schuurmans and Patrascu [20] solved the constraint satisfaction problem by the cutting plane method [4]. The approach iteratively searches for the most violated constraint:\nargmin x,a\n[ ∑\ni\nw (t) i Fi(x, a)−R(x, a)\n] (9)\nwith respect to the solutionw(t) of a relaxed ALP. The most violated constraint is added to the linear program, which is in turn resolved for a new vectorw(t+1). This procedure is iterated until no violated constraint is found. In such a case, the vector w(t) is an optimal solution to the ALP.\nThe space complexity of both constraint satisfaction methods [10, 20] is exponential in the treewidth of the constraint space. As a result, the methods are unsuitable for problems with a large treewidth. However, such problems can be still solved approximately. For instance, de Farias and Van Roy [7] proposed Monte Carlo approximations of the constraint space. Kveton and Hauskrecht [14] showed how to search for the most violated constraint (Equation 9) using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling."

Due to this interpretation, we assume that all terms dk,i are non-negative and that the partitioning matrixD is normalized such that the equality ∑ k dk,i = 1 holds for all i. Under such assumptions, it is trivial to show that the satisfaction of the K constraintsDMw(x, a)T ≥ 0 leads to the satisfaction of a corresponding ALP constraint. The claim can be proved based on the identity:\n1DMw(x, a) T =\n∑\ni\nwiFi(x, a)−R(x, a), (15)\nwhere 1 is a row vector of ones. It follows that every PALP solution is feasible in a corresponding ALP.\nSimilarly to ALP, the feasibility of the PALP formulation is guaranteed if the set of basis functions includes a constant function f0(x) ≡ 1. We assume that the function is present in allK constraint spaces. In each of them, we define a new weight wk0 , which reflects the contribution of this function.

The width of the decompositions should be small since the complexity of satisfying a single constraint space is exponential in its treewidth [10].\nHow to generate the best PALP approximation within a certain complexity limit is an open question. In the experimental section, we build the matrixD based on a heuristic. The heuristic generates a constraint space for every expectation term Fk(x, a) in Equation 9.

Let w̃ be a solution to the PALP formulation (12). Then V w̃ ≥ V ∗.\nProof: Since w̃ is a solution to the PALP formulation (12), it is also a suboptimal solution to the ALP formulation (5). Therefore, the constraint V w̃≥T ∗V w̃ is satisfied. Furthermore, note that the Bellman operator T ∗ is both monotonic and contracting. Hence, the inequality V w̃≥T ∗V w̃ yields the following sequence of inequalities:\nV w̃ ≥ T ∗V w̃ ≥ T ∗T ∗V w̃ ≥ · · · ≥ V ∗.\nThis step concludes our proof.\nThe above result allows us to restate the objective Eψ[V w] in PALP. Proposition 2. The objective in the PALP formulation (12) can be rewritten as ‖V ∗ − V w‖1,ψ , where ‖·‖1,ψ is an L1norm weighted by the state relevance density function ψ.\nProof: Follows from the fact that all solutions to the PALP formulation (12) satisfy the constraint V w≥V ∗.\nBased on Proposition 2, we conclude that PALP optimizes the linear value function approximation with respect to the reweighted L1-norm error ‖V ∗ − V w‖1,ψ . The following theorem draws a parallel between optimizing this objective and the max-norm error ‖V ∗ − V w‖∞. Theorem 2. Let w̃ be a solution to the PALP formulation (12). Then the expected error of the value function V w̃ can be bounded as: ∥∥∥V ∗ − V w̃\n∥∥∥ 1,ψ ≤ 2 1− γ min w ‖V ∗ − V w‖∞ + Kδ 1− γ ,\nwhere ‖·‖1,ψ is an L1-norm weighted by the state relevance density function ψ, ‖·‖∞ is the max-norm, δ is a scalar that reflects how hard is to make an ALP solution feasible in our PALP formulation, andK denotes the number of constraint spaces in the PALP.\nProof: Our proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 2 by de Farias and Van Roy [6]. The vectors w̃, w, and w∗ denote an optimal solution to the PALP formulation, its suboptimal solution, and the vector that minimizes the max-norm error ‖V ∗ − V w‖∞, respectively. First, we bound the objective in the PALP as follows:\n∥∥∥V ∗ − V w̃ ∥∥∥ 1,ψ ≤ ∥∥V ∗ − V w ∥∥ 1,ψ\n≤ ∥∥V ∗ − V w ∥∥ ∞ .\nSecond, we bound the max-norm error of V w by the triangle inequality:\n∥∥V ∗ − V w ∥∥ ∞ ≤ ∥∥∥V ∗ − V ŵ ∥∥∥ ∞ + ∥∥∥V ŵ − V w ∥∥∥ ∞ ,\nwhere ŵ is an arbitrary solution to the ALP formulation. In the rest of the proof, we bound the two terms on the righthand side of the inequality. The first term reflects how hard is to fit the linear value function approximation to the value function V ∗. If the vector ŵ is set such that:\nŵ = w∗ + 1 + γ\n1− γ\n∥∥∥V ∗ − V w ∗ ∥∥∥ ∞ i0,\nwhere i0=(1, 0, . . . , 0) is an indicator of the constant basis function f0(x) ≡ 1, the following inequality:\n∥∥∥V ∗ − V ŵ ∥∥∥ ∞ ≤ 2 1− γ ∥∥∥V ∗ − V w ∗ ∥∥∥ ∞\nholds [6]. The second term reflects how hard it to make the ALP solution ŵ feasible in the PALP. If the vectorw is set such that:\nw = ŵ + Kδ\n1− γ i0,\nwhere i0=(1, 0, . . . , 0) is an indicator of the constant basis function f0(x)≡1, δ = −minx,amin(DMŵ(x, a)T), and the function min(DM\nŵ (x, a)T) computes the minimum of\nthe vectorDM ŵ (x, a)T, we can guarantee the feasibility of w. The proof is based on the observation that all constraints in the feasible PALP formulation (16) are satisfied when the weights wk0 are set such that:\nwk0 = 1\nK ŵ0 +\nδ\n1− γ .\nBased on this setting, the max-norm error between V ŵ and V w is bounded as:\n∥∥∥V ŵ − V w ∥∥∥ ∞ ≤ Kδ 1− γ .\nThis step concludes our proof.\nThe above result can be interpreted as follows. PALP yields a close approximation V w̃ to the optimal value function V ∗ if the function V ∗ lies in the span of basis functions and the penalty δ for partitioning the ALP constraint space is small. Unfortunately, we do not have a good bound for the penalty term δ. The value of δ can be as bad as ‖ŵ‖1+Rmax, where Rmax denotes the maximum immediate reward in an MDP. Hence, the bound in Theorem 2 is not very tight in practice. Nevertheless, it provides valuable insights into two sources of errors for PALP approximations."

The difference between the two types of the computers is in the reward for keeping them running.\nThe immediate reward for keeping a workstation running is 1. The reward for keeping the server running is 2.\nThe network administration problem is a challenging MDP due to the size of its state space. Specifically, since the state of the network is a product of individual computer states, it is exponential in the number of computers. Therefore, only small instances of the problem can be solved exactly. In the rest of the section, we focus on large-scale problems and try to solve them through linear value function approximations (Equation 4).

Specifically, note that the rewards of the policies are within 95 percent of our baseline in all experiments. Unfortunately, these good results cannot be explained by Theorem 2 because our bound is too loose. To explain our results, we tried to investigate the similarity of basis function weightsw obtained by ALP and PALP. As illustrated in Figure 6, the magnitudes of the weights can be very different. However, the weights exhibit similar trends. In turn, value function approximations corresponding to the weights must have similar shapes, and their greedy policies\nare similar as a result.\nFigure 5 also suggests that PALP policies can be computed significantly faster than ALP policies. This speedup results from working with sparse decompositions (Figure 7) of the original constraint space rather than the space itself. Moreover, note that the treewidth of the n× n network administration problem (Figure 4c) is n. Therefore, the complexity of learning ALP policies for this problem is naturally exponential in n. On the other hand, the complexity of learning PALP policies is polynomial in n. This claim follows from the observation that the number of PALP constraint spaces is n2 and their treewidth is not dependent on n. As a result, PALP on the grid network provides an exponential speedup over ALP. This result can be verified by the analysis of the computation time trends in Figure 5.\nFinally, Figure 5 illustrates that PALP policies are superior to ALP policies, which are obtained by ALP with randomly sampled constraints. In most cases, the PALP policies yield significantly higher rewards than the average sampled ALP approximation. For all larger network administration problems, the policies are as good or better than the best of these\napproximations. At the same time, the computation time of the PALP policies is shorter or comparable to the computation time of the sampled approximations."

In this context, Meila [17] proposed using a mixture of trees to approximate an arbitrary joint probability distribution defined by a Bayesian network. Second, the bound in Theorem 2 is definitely loose in practice. How to make this bound tight is an interesting open question.

The main idea of the method is to approximate the optimal value function by a set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming (LP). This paper proposes a new ALP approximation. Comparing to the standard ALP formulation, we decompose the constraint space into a set of low-dimensional spaces. This structure allows for solving the new LP efficiently. In particular, the constraints of the LP can be satisfied in a compact form without an exponential dependence on the treewidth of ALP constraints. We study both practical and theoretical aspects of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate its scale-up potential on an MDP with more than 2 states.",
