      "text" : "Constrained counting, the problem of counting the number of solutions for a set of constraints, is important in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. Its interesting applications in several fields include probabilistic inference [25,10], planning [12], combinatorial designs and software engineering [23,15]. Constrained counting for propositional formulas is also called model counting, to which probabilistic inference is easily reducible. However, model counting is a canonical #P-complete problem, even for polynomial-time solvable problems like 2-SAT [31], thus presents fascinating challenges for both theoreticians and practitioners.\nThere are already a few approaches for counting solutions over propositional logic formulas and SMT(BV) formulas. Recently, hashing-based approximate counting achieves both strong theoretical guarantees and good scalability [24]. The use of universal hash functions in counting problems began in [28,30], but the resulting algorithm scaled poorly in practice. A scalable approximate counter ApproxMC in [8] scales to large problem instances, while preserves rigorous approximation guarantees. ApproxMC has been extended to finite-domain discrete integration, with applications to probabilistic inference [13,5,2], and improved by designing efficient universal hash functions [19,6] and reducing the use of NP-oracle calls from linear to logarithmic [9].\n? Corresponding author\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 90\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 3\nThe basic idea in ApproxMC is to estimate the model count by randomly and iteratively cutting the whole space down to a small “enough” cell, using hash functions, and sampling it. The total model count is estimated by a multiplication of the number of solutions in this cell and the ratio of whole space to the small cell. To determine the size of the small cell, which is essentially a small-scale model counting problem with the model counts bounded by some thresholds, a model enumeration in the cell is adopted. In previous works, the enumeration query was handled by transforming it into satisfiability queries, which is much more time-consuming than a single satisfiability query. An algorithm called MBound [17] only invokes satisfiability query once for each cut. Its model count is determined with high precision by the number of cuts down to the boundary of being unsatisfiable. However, this property is not strong enough to give rigorous guarantees, and MBound only returns an approximation of upper or lower bound of the model count.\nIn this paper, a new hashing-based approximate counting algorithm, with only satisfiability query, is proposed, building on a correlation between the model count and the probability of the hashed formula being unsatisfiable. Dynamic stopping criterion for the algorithm to terminate, once meeting the theoretical guarantee of accuracy, are presented. Like previous works, a theoretical termination bound T is shown. Theoretical insights over the efficiency of a prevalent heuristic strategy called leap-frogging are also provided.\nThe proposed approach is a general framework easy to handle various types of constraints. Prototype tools for propositional logic formulas and SMT(BV) formulas are implemented. An extensive evaluation on a suite of benchmarks demonstrates that (i) the approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximate model counters, including a counter designed for SMT(BV) formulas, and (ii) the dynamic stopping criterion is promising. The statistical results fit well with the theoretical bound of approximation, and it terminates much earlier before termination bound T is met.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Preliminary material is in Section 2, related works in Section 3, the algorithm in Section 4, analysis in Section 5, experimental results in Section 6, and finally, concluding remarks in Section 7."

      "text" : "Let F (x) denote a propositional logic formula on n variables x = (x1, . . . , xn). Let S and SF denote the whole space and the solution space of F , respectively. Let #F denote the cardinality of SF , i.e. the number of solutions of F . ( , δ)-bound To count #F , an ( , δ) approximation algorithm is an algorithm which on every input formula F , > 0 and δ > 0, outputs a number Ỹ such that Pr[(1 + )−1#F ≤ Ỹ ≤ (1 + )#F ] ≥ 1 − δ. These are called ( , δ)-counters and ( , δ)bound, respectively [21]. Hash Function LetHF be a family of XOR-based bit-level hash functions on the variables of a formulaF . Each hash functionH ∈ HF is of the formH(x) = a0 ⊕n i=1 aixi, where a0, . . . , an are Boolean constants. In the hashing procedure Hashing(F), a functionH ∈ HF is generated by independently and randomly choosing ais from a uniform distribution. Thus for an assignment α, it holds that PrH∈HF (H(α) = true) = 1 2 .\nGiven a formula F , let Fi denote a hashed formula F ∧H1∧· · ·∧Hi, whereH1, . . . ,Hi are independently generated by the hashing procedure.\nSatisfiability Query Let Solving(F) denote the satisfiability query of a formula F . With a target formula F as input, the satisfiability of F is returned by Solving(F).\nEnumeration Query Let Counting(F, p) denote the bounded solution enumeration query. With a constraint formula F and a threshold p (p ≥ 2) as inputs, a number s is returned such that s = min(p − 1,#F ). Specifically, 0 is returned for unsatisfiable F , or p = 1 which is meaningless.\nSMT(BV) Formula SMT(BV) formulas are quantifier-free and fixed-size that combine propositional logic formulas with constraints of bit-vector theory. For example, ¬(x + y = 0) ∨ (x = y << 1), where x and y are bit-vector variables, << is the shift-left operator, is a propositional logic formula ¬A ∨ B that combines bit-vector constraints A ≡ (x + y = 0) and B ≡ (x = y << 1). To apply hash functions to an SMT(BV) formula, a bit-vector is treated as a set of Boolean variables."

      "text" : "[1] showed that almost uniform sampling from propositional constraints, a closely related problem to constrained counting, is solvable in probabilistic polynomial time with an NP oracle. Building on this, [8] proposed the first scalable approximate model counting algorithm ApproxMC for propositional formulas. ApproxMC is based on a family of 2-universal bit-level hash functions that compute XOR of randomly chosen propositional variables. Subsequently, [6] presented an approximate model counter that uses word-level hash functions, which directly leverage the power of sophisticated SMT solvers, though the framework of the probabilistic algorithm is similar to [8]. In the current work, the family of hash functions in [8] is adopted, which was shown to be 3-independent in [18], and is revealed to possess better properties than expected by the experimental results and the theoretical analysis in the current work.\nFor completeness, ApproxMC [8,11] is listed here as Algorithm 1. Its inputs are a formula F and two accuracy parameters T and pivot. T determines the number of times ApproxMCCore invoked, and pivot determines the threshold of the enumeration query. The function ApproxMCCore starts from the formula F0, iteratively calls Counting and Hashing over each Fi, to cut the space (cell) of all models of F0 using random hash functions, until the count of Fi is no larger than pivot, then breaks out the loop and adds the approximation 2is into list C. The main procedure ApproxMC repeatedly invokes ApproxMCCore and collects the returned values, at last returning the median number of list C. The general algorithm in [6] is similar to Algorithm 1, but could cut the cell with dynamically determined proportion instead of the constant 12 , due to the word-level hash functions. [9] improves ApproxMCCore via binary search to reduce the number of enumeration queries from linear to logarithmic. This binary search improvement is orthogonal to the proposed algorithm in the current work.\nAlgorithm 1 1: function APPROXMC(F , T , pivot) 2: for 1 to T do 3: c← ApproxMCCore(F , p, pivot) 4: if (c 6= 0) then AddToList(C, c) 5: end for 6: return FindMedian(C) 7: end function 8: function APPROXMCCORE(F , pivot) 9: F0 ← F 10: for i← 0 to∞ do 11: s← Counting(Fi, pivot+ 1) 12: if (0 ≤ s ≤ pivot) then return 2is 13: Hi+1 ← Hashing(F ) 14: Fi+1 ← Fi ∧Hi+1 15: end for 16: end function"

      "text" : "In this section, a new hashing-based algorithm for approximate model counting, with only satisfiability queries, will be proposed, building on some probabilistic approximate correlations between the model count and the probability of the hashed formula being unsatisfiable.\nLet Fd = F ∧H1 ∧ · · · ∧Hd be a hashed formula resulted by iteratively hashing d times independently over a formula F . Fd is unsatisfiable if and only if no solution of F satisfies Fd, thus PrFd(Fd is unsat) = PrFd(Fd(α) = false, α ∈ SF ). The following approximation is a key for the new algorithm\nPr Fd\n(Fd is unsat) ≈ (1− 2−d)#F . (1)\nBased on Equation (1), an approximation of #F is achieved by taking logarithm on the value of PrFd(Fd is unsat), which is estimated in turn by sampling Fd. However, Equation (1) can not be proven directly, since it is equivalent to PrFd(Fd(α) = false, α ∈ SF ) ≈ ∏ α∈SF PrFd(Fd(α) = false), but HF was only known to be 3-independent. In the following, we consider a similar but different family of hash functions to provide some intuition (not proof) about Equation (1). From the definition H(x) = a0 ⊕n i=1 aixi, it holds that (i) PrH(H(α) = true) = 1 2 for any assignment α, and (ii) |SH | = |S|2 , unless a1 = · · · = an = 0. Now let G be a family of hash functions also with these properties, defined as follows. Each hash function G in G is of the form\nG(x) = { true x ∈ SG false x 6∈ SG .\nThe solution set SG is generated by sampling |S| 2 points in S without replacement (simple random sample). For any given assignment α, obviously PrG(G(α) = true) = 12 .\nMoreover, G is not k-independent for k > |S|2 , since the probability of more than |S| 2 variables having the same value is always zero.\nTheorem 1. Let Ĝd = G1 ∧ · · · ∧ Gd, where G1, . . . , Gd are independently sampled from G, and let F ′d = F ∧ Ĝd. Then\nlim n→∞ Pr F ′d\n(F ′d is unsat) = (1− 2−d)#F . (2)\nProof. Since PrG(G(α) = true) = 12 andGis are independent, we have PrĜd(Ĝd(α) = true) = ( 1 2 )d . Let SĜd denote the solution space of Ĝd, then the expectation E(|SĜd |)\n= ( 1 2 )d |S| = 2n−d. Since eachGi is generated by simple random sample and uniquely determined by its solution set, the number of distinct functions of Ĝd is ( |S| |SĜd | ) , and the\nnumber of distinct Ĝds which are unsatisfiable over SF is (|S−SF | |SĜd | ) . The probability of SF ∩ SĜd = ∅ is(|S−SF | |SĜd |\n) ( |S| |SĜd | ) = (2n−#F2n−d )( 2n 2n−d ) = (2n −#F )!(2n − 2n−d)! (2n)!(2n −#F − 2n−d)!\n= (2n − 2−d2n) 2n (2n − 2−d2n − 1) 2n − 1 . . . (2n − 2−d2n −#F + 1) 2n −#F + 1 . (3)\nThe LHS (left-hand-side) of (3) is also PrF ′d(F ′ d is unsat). The RHS of (3) converges to (1− 2−d)#F as n→∞. ut\nSinceHF and G have some common characteristics, Equations (2) and (1) may also hold for HF . In practice for finite n, Equation (2) only holds approximately. To make the value of PrF ′d(F ′ d is unsat) arbitrarily close to (1 − 2−d)#F , dummy variables can be inserted into F while keeping #F unchanged, such as inserting a new variable xn+1 with constraint xn+1 = true. These variables and constraints are meaningless for SAT solvers and ignored at the beginning of the search. Experimental results indicate that Equation (1) holds even without inserting any dummy variable. Here we assume Equation (1) holds in convenience of describing our approach.\nThe pseudo-code for our approach is presented in Algorithm 2. The inputs are the target formula F and a constant T which determines the number of times GetDepth invoked. GetDepth calls Solving and Hashing repeatedly until an unsatisfiable formula Fdepth is encountered, and returns the depth. Every time GetDepth returns a depth, the value of C[i] is increased, for all i < depth. At line 9, the algorithm picks a number d such that C[d] is close to T/2, since the error estimation fails when C[d]/T is close to 0 or 1. The final counting result is returned by the formula log1−(1/2)d counter T at line 11. Theoretical analysis of the value of T and the correctness of algorithm are in Section 5.\nDynamic Stopping Criterion The essence of Algorithm 2 is a randomized sampler over a binomial distribution. The number of samples is determined by the value of T , which\nAlgorithm 2 Satisfiability Testing based Approximate Counter (STAC) 1: function STAC(F , T ) 2: initialize C[i]s with zeros 3: for t← 1 to T do 4: depth← GetDepth(F ) 5: for i← 0 to depth− 1 do 6: C[i]← C[i] + 1 7: end for 8: end for 9: pick a number d such that C[d] is closest to T/2 10: counter ← T − C[d] 11: return log1−2−d counter T\n/* return 0 when d = 0 */ 12: end function 13: function GETDEPTH(F ) 14: F0 ← F 15: for i← 0 to∞ do 16: b← Solving(Fi) 17: if (b is false) then return i 18: Hi+1 ← Hashing(Fi) 19: Fi+1 ← Fi ∧Hi+1 20: end for 21: end function\nis pre-computed for a given ( , δ)-bound, and we loosen the bound of T to meet the guarantee in theoretical analysis. However, it usually does not loop T times in practice. A variation with dynamic stopping criterion is presented in Algorithm 3.\nLine 2 to 7 is the same as Algorithm 2, still setting T as a stopping rule and terminating whenever t = T . Line 8 to 16 is the key part of this variation, calculating the binomial proportion confidence interval [L,U ] of an intermediate result M for each\ncycle. A commonly used formula q±z1−δ √ q(1−q) t [3,32] is adopted, which is justified by the central limit theorem to compute the 1 − δ confidence interval. The exact count #F lies in the interval [L,U ] with probability 1 − δ. Combining the inequalities presented in line 13, the interval [(1+ )−1M, (1+ )M ] is the ( , δ)-bound. The algorithm terminates when the condition in line 13 comes true, and its correctness is obvious. The time complexity of Algorithm 3 is still the same as the original algorithm, though it usually terminates earlier.\nSatisfiability And Enumeration Query For a propositional logic formula or an SMT formula, there is a direct way to enumerate solutions with satisfiability queries. For example, we assert the negation of a solution which is found by satisfiability query, so that the constraint solver will provide other models. So Counting(F, p) invokes up to p times Solving(F) by this way. This method is adopted by all previous hashingbased ( , δ)-counters [8,11,6].\nLeap-frogging Strategy Recall that GetDepth is invoked T times with the same arguments, and the loop of line 15 to 20 in the pseudo-code of GetDepth in Algorithm 2\nAlgorithm 3 STAC with Dynamic Stopping Criterion 1: function STAC DSC(F , T , , δ) 2: initialize C[i]s with zeros 3: for t← 1 to T do 4: depth← GetDepth(F ) 5: for i← 0 to depth− 1 do 6: C[i]← C[i] + 1 7: end for 8: for each d that C[d] > 0 do 9: q ← t−C[d]\nt\n10: M ← log1−2−d q 11: U ← log1−2−d(q − z1−δ √ q(1−q) t )\n12: L← log1−2−d(q + z1−δ √ q(1−q) t ) 13: if U < (1 + )M and L > (1 + )−1M then 14: return M 15: end if 16: end for 17: end for 18: end function\nis time consuming for large i. A heuristic called leap-frogging to overcome this bottleneck was proposed in [7,8]. Their experiments indicate that this strategy is extremely efficient in practice. The average depth d̄ of each invocation of GetDepth is recorded. In all subsequent invocations, the loop starts by initializing i to d̄− offset, and sets i to d̄ − 2 ∗ offset for unsatisfiable Fi repeatedly until a proper i is found for a satisfiable Fi. In practice, the constant offset is usually set to 5. Theorem 4 in Section 5 shows that the depth computed by GetDepth lies in an interval [d, d + 7] with probability over 90%. So it suffices to invoke Solving in constant time since the second iteration.\nWilson Score Interval The central limit theorem applies poorly to binomial distributions for small sample size or proportion close to 0 or 1. The following interval [34]\n1\n1 + z 2\nt\n[q + z2 2t ± z √ q(1− q) t + z2 4t2 ]\nhas good properties to achieve better approximations. Note that the overhead of computing intervals is negligible."

      "text" : "In this section, we assume Equation (1) holds. Based on this assumption, theoretical results on the error estimation of our approach are presented. Recall that in Algorithm 2, #F is approximated by a value log1−2−d counter T , based on Equation (1). Let qd denote the value of (1 − 2−d)#F . We will assume that Pr(Fd is unsat) = qd for a randomly\ngenerated formula Fd. This assumption is justified by Equations (1) and (2). Then the counter in Algorithm 2 is a random variable following a binomial distribution B(T, qd). Since the ratio counterT is the proportion of successes in a Bernoulli trial process, it is used to estimate the value of qd.\nTheorem 2. Let z1−δ be the 1− δ quantile of N(0, 1) and\nT = max ( d( z1−δ\n2qd(1− q d) )2e, d( z1−δ 2(q (1+ )−1 d − qd) )2)e\n) . (4)\nThen Pr[#F1+ ≤ log1−2−d counter T ≤ (1 + )#F ] ≥ 1− δ.\nProof. By above discussions, the ratio counterT is the proportion of successes in a Bernoulli trial process which follows the distribution B(T, qd). Then we use the approximate formula of a binomial proportion confidence interval qd ± z1−δ √ qd(1−qd) T , i.e., Pr[qd −\nz1−δ\n√ qd(1−qd)\nT ≤ counter T ≤ qd + z1−δ √ qd(1−qd) T ] ≥ 1 − δ. The log function is\nmonotone, so we only have to consider the following two inequalities:\nlog1−2−d (qd − z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ) ≤ (1 + )#F, (5)\n(1 + )−1#F ≤ log1−2−d (qd + z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ). (6)\nWe first consider Equation (5). By substituting log1−2−d qd for #F , we have\nlog1−2−d (qd − z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ) ≤ (1 + ) log1−2−d qd\n⇔ qd − z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ≥ q(1+ )d\n⇔ qd(1− q d) ≥ z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT\n⇔ T ≥ ( z1−δ qd(1− q d) )2qd(1− qd).\nSince 0 ≤ qd ≤ 1, we have √ qd(1− qd) ≤ 12 . Therefore, T = d( z1−δ 2qd(1−q d)\n)2e ≥ ( z1−δqd(1−q d)\n)2qd(1− qd). We next consider Equation (6). Similarly, we have\nlog1−2−d (qd + z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ) ≥ (1 + )−1 log1−2−d qd\n⇔ qd + z1−δ\n√ qd(1− qd)\nT ≤ q1/(1+ )d\n⇔ T ≥ ( z1−δ q 1/(1+ ) d − qd )2qd(1− qd).\nSo Equation (4) implies Equations (5) and (6).\nTheorem 2 shows that the result of Algorithm 2 lies in the interval [(1+ )−1#F, (1+ )#F ] with probability at least 1 − δ when T is set to a proper value. So we focus on the possible smallest value of T in subsequent analysis.\nThe next two lemmas are easy to show by derivations.\nLemma 1. z1−δ2x(1−x ) is monotone increasing and monotone decreasing in [(1+ ) − 1 , 1] and [0, (1 + )− 1 ] respectively.\nLemma 2. z1−δ 2(x1/(1+ )−x) is monotone increasing and monotone decreasing in [(1 +\n)− 1+ , 1] and [0, (1 + )− 1+ ] respectively.\nTheorem 3. If #F > 5, then there exists a proper integer value of d such that qd ∈ [0.4, 0.65].\nProof. Let x denote the value of qd = (1 − 12d ) #F , then we have (1 − 1 2d+1 )#F =\n( 12 + x\n1 #F 2 ) #F . Consider the derivation\nd d#F ( 1 2 +\nx 1 #F\n2 ) #F = (\n1 2 + x\n1 #F 2 )#F ln ( 1 2 + x 1 #F 2 ) x 1 #F 2 lnx d d#F (#F−1).\nNote that ( 12 + x\n1 #F 2 ) #F and x 1 #F 2 are the positive terms and ln ( 1 2 + x 1 #F\n2 ), lnx and d\nd#F (#F −1) are the negative terms. Therefore, the derivation is negative, i.e., ( 12 + x 1 #F\n2 ) #F is monotone decreasing with respect to #F . In addition, ( 12 +\nx 1 5\n2 ) 5 is the\nupper bound when #F ≥ 5. Let x = 0.4, then (1− 1\n2d+1 )#F ≤ ( 12 +\n0.4 1 5\n2 ) 5 ≈ 0.65. Since (1− 120 ) #F = 0 and limd→+∞(1− 12d ) #F = 1 and (1− 1 2d\n)#F is continuous with respect to d, we consider the circumstances close to the interval [0.4, 0.65]. Assume there exists an integer σ such that (1− 12σ ) #F < 0.4 and (1− 12σ+1 ) #F > 0.65. According to the intermediate value theorem, we can find a value e > 0 such that (1− 12σ+e ) #F = 0.4. Obviously, we have (1− 12σ+e+1 ) #F ≤ 0.65 which is contrary with the monotone decreasing property.\nFrom Theorem 3 and Lemma 1 and 2, it suffices to consider the results of Equation (4) when qd = 0.4 and qd = 0.65. For example, T = 22 for = 0.8 and δ = 0.2, T = 998 for = 0.1 and δ = 0.1, etc. We therefore pre-computed a table of the value of T . The proof of next theorem is omitted.\nTheorem 4. There exists an integer d such that qd < 0.05 and qd+7 > 0.95.\nLet depth denote the result of GetDepth in Algorithm 2. Then Fd is unsatisfiable only if d ≥ depth. Theorem 4 shows that there exists an integer d such that Pr(depth < d) < 0.05 and Pr(depth < d + 7) > 0.95, i.e., Pr(d ≤ depth ≤ d + 7) > 0.9. So in most cases, the value of depth lies in an interval [d, d + 7]. Also, it is easy to see that log2 #F lies in this interval as well. The following theorem is obvious now.\nTheorem 5. Algorithm 2 runs in time linear in log2 #F relative to an NP-oracle."

The statistical results in Table 1 show that the frequencies are around 80 for 100-times experiments which fit the 80% probability. The average number of iterations T̄ listed in Table 1 is smaller than the theoretical termination bound T which is 22, indicating that the dynamic stopping technique significantly improves the efficiency. In addition,\nthe values of T̄ appear to be stable for different instances, hinting that there exists a constant upper bound on T which is irrelevant to instances.\nIn Section 4, we considered a similar but different function family G and proved Equation (2). It suggests that Equation (1) may hold on H for infinite n. However, our approach does not insert any dummy variables to increase n. Intuitively, our approach may start to fail on “loose” formulas, i.e., with an “infinitesimal” fraction of non-models. Instance special-1 and special-3 are such “loose” formulas where special-1 has 220 models with only 20 variables and special-3 has 225 − 1 models with 25 variables. Instance special-2 is another extreme case which only has one model.

      "text" : "Since our approach is not a ( , δ)-counter in theory, we also compared STAC CNF with bounding counters (SampleCount [16], MBound [17]) and guarantee-less counters (ApproxCount [33], SampleTreeSearch [14]). Table 5 shows the experimental results.\nFor SampleCount, we used α = 2 and t = 3.5 so that αt = 7, giving a correctness confidence of 1 − 2−7 = 99%. The number of samples per variable setting, z, was chosen to be 20. Our results show that the lower-bound approximated by SampleCount is smaller than exact count #F by one or more orders of magnitude. We tried larger z, such as z = 100 and z = 1000, but still failed to obtain a lower-bound larger than #F/10. Moreover, there are some wrong approximations on DQMR networks problems, e.g., or-100-20-6-UC-60 only has 2.8 × 107 models but SampleCount returns a lower-bound≥ 1.1× 1029. SampleCount is more efficient on Langford problems and random 3-CNF problems, but weak on problems with a large number of variables, such as blockmap problems.\nFor MBound, we used α = 1 and t = 7 so that αt = 7, also giving a correctness confidence of 1−2−7 = 99%.

The size of XOR constraints k should be no more than half of the number of variables n, i.e., k ≤ n/2. We found that XOR constraints start to fail as k << n/2. So in our experiments, k was chosen to be close to n/2. Since MBound can only check the bound and may return failure as the bound too close to the exact count, we implemented a binary search to find the best lower-bound verified by MBound. The results in Table 5 are the best lower-bounds and the running times of the whole binary search procedure. Though the lower-bounds are better than SampleCount, they are still around #F/10. Similar to our approach, the running times of MBound are also quite relevant to the size of #F .\nFor ApproxCount, we manually increased the value of “cutoff” as ApproxCount required. Note that ApproxCount calls exact model counter Cachet [27] and Relsat [20] after formula simplifications, so it sometimes returns the exact counts, such as blockmap 05 01, blockmap 05 02, 5step and tire-1. On Langford problems and DQMR networks problems, wrong approximations were provided. On other instances, the results show that STAC CNF usually outperforms ApproxCount.\nFor SampleTreeSearch, we used its default setting about the number of samples, which is a constant. The results show that it is very efficient and provides good approximations. Our approach only outperforms SampleTreeSearch on blockmap problems which consist of a large number of variables. However, there is a lack of analysis on the accuracy of the approximation of SampleTreeSearch, i.e., no explicit relation between the number of samples and the accuracy."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a new hashing-based approximate algorithm with dynamic stopping criterion. Our approach has two key strengths: it requires only one satisfiability query for each cut, and it terminates once meeting the theoretical guarantee of accuracy. We implemented prototype tools for propositional logic formulas and SMT(BV) formulas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is efficient and promising. Despite that we are unable to prove the correctness of Equation (1), the experimental results fit it quite well. This phenomenon might be caused by some hidden properties of the hash functions. To fully understand these functions and their correlation with the model count of the hashed formula might be an interesting problem to the community. In addition, extending the idea in this paper to count solutions of other formulas is also a direction of future research."
