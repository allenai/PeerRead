      "text" : "We address the multi-focus image fusion problem, where multiple images captured with different focal settings are to be fused into an all-in-focus image of higher quality. Algorithms for this problem necessarily admit the source image characteristics along with focused and blurred feature. However, most sparsity-based approaches use a single dictionary in focused feature space to describe multi-focus images, and ignore the representations in blurred feature space. Here, we propose a multi-focus image fusion approach based on coupled sparse representation. The approach exploits the facts that (i) the patches in given training set can be sparsely represented by a couple of overcomplete dictionaries related to the focused and blurred categories of images; and (ii) merging such representations leads to a more flexible and therefore better fusion strategy than the one based on just selecting the sparsest representation in the original image estimate. By jointly learning the coupled dictionary, we enforce the similarity of sparse representations in the focused and blurred feature spaces, and then introduce a fusion approach to combine these representations for generating an all-in-focus image. We also discuss the advantages of the fusion approach based on coupled sparse representation and present an efficient algorithm for learning the coupled dictionary.

INTRODUCTION\nOver the last several decades, considerable attention has been given to the multi-focus image fusion problem [1]–[5]. Multi-focus image fusion is an effective post-processing technique for combining multiple images captured with different focal distances into an all-in-focus image, without sacrificing image quality, and at the same time without using specialized optic sensors [6]–[8]. The problem is of high importance in many fields, ranging from remote sensing to medical imaging [9]–[12], especially for addressing the demand for cost minimization of optical sensors/cameras. The majority of the existing literature on the topic can be categorized into two basic classes of approaches [13]: the spatial frequency-based and transform domainbased approaches. In the first class, the methods such as image fusion based on Laplacian pyramid (LP) [14], spatial frequency (SF) [15], multi-scale weighted gradient (MWG) [16], and variance [13] aim to directly select the best pixels or regions to fuse multiple images. The main drawback of these methods is that they may produce blocking artifacts because of misaligned decision map in focused boundary and wrong selection in sub-focused regions. Fusion methods from the second class suggest to apply multiscale transforms to decompose source images, and construct an all-in-focus image in the inverse transform domain. Corresponding algorithms include discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [17], curvelet transform (CVT) [9], non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) [18] among others. However, all aforementioned traditional methods are still sensitive to image misregistration, and they may suffer from undesirable artifacts.\nLooking at recent approaches, sparsity and overcompleteness have been successfully used for computational image fusion [19]–[27]. The methods exploit the fact that patches of natural image can be compactly represented using an overcomplete dictionary as a linear combination of only few atoms. It means that the vector of weighting coefficients for the atoms is sparse. Formally, the basic synthesis model suggests that the signal x can be described as being a linear combination of few atoms over an overcomplete dictionary D, and the problem of seeking such sparse representation can be formulated as\nmin α ‖α‖0 s.t. x ≈Dα (1)\nwhere α is the sparse vector of coefficients applied to atoms in D and ‖ · ‖0 denotes the operator that counts the number of non-zero entries in a vector. As problem (1) is known to be NP-hard because of its combinational nature, a suboptimal strategy for addressing the above problem is based on replacing the operator ‖ · ‖0 with l1-norm and learning adaptive\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n3 dictionary from the training data. Many image processing applications have benefited remarkably by using such approach with learned overcomplete dictionary. Representative examples include the K-SVD method [28], the method of optimal directions (MOD) [29], the online dictionary learning (OLD) method [30], and their variants. “Good” dictionaries are expected to be highly adaptive to the observed images/signals and to contribute accurate sparse representations. While the single dictionary model has been extensively studied, there is an advanced coupled dictionary viewpoint to sparsity and overcompleteness that has tracked the double feature space representation problem [31]–[34]. Corresponding approaches explicitly learn a pair of dictionaries from training sets of double image patches, and formulate sparse and redundant representations for various applications and scenarios. The combination of learned coupled dictionary and sparse approximation is shown to be superior for representing double feature spaces [35]–[38].\nThe aforementioned image fusion methods [19]–[25], [27] directly learn and exploit a single overcomplete dictionary in a single feature space in order to describe multiple images which contain both the focused and blurred categories of image features. Hence, these methods ignore the sparse representations in blurred feature space, and set limits on sparsity of the vector of coefficients. The latter consequently leads to less accurate fusing coefficients. These disadvantages, which are associated with working in single feature spaces, motivate us to perform fusion instead in double feature spaces. In particular, instead of learning a single overcomplete dictionary from the focused features only, this paper suggests to learn two dictionaries over focused and blurred feature spaces, and then use the pair of dictionaries to perform fusing via coupled sparse representation. In this way, we exploit the existing structure shared by all available multi-focus images, correlate the representations over double feature spaces, and significantly improve the fusion performance. Our approach based on dictionaries learned from double feature spaces and fusion in the space of sparse representations proves to be more accurate than traditional methods based on single learned dictionary."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose to extend the coupled dictionary learning approach based on coupled sparse and redundant representations to the problem of fusing multi-focus images. Coupled overcomplete dictionaries are expected to lead to more compact representation of the focused and blurred categories of images. Based on the coupled dictionary, a simple fusion of sparse coefficients based on plain averaging can be then used while seeking for optimal fusion coefficients\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n4 needed to reconstruct an all-in-focus image. The paper presents both algorithmic developments and simulation results for multi-focus image fusion. Compared to the existing prior works, the main difference of the proposed approach is that the coupled dictionary is exploited for more flexible and accurate representation of multi-focus images. Such sparse representation then lead to higher quality results for image fusion. Towards realizing this approach, this paper makes the following main contributions.\n• We formulate the multi-focus image fusion problem as a problem of obtaining an all-in-focus\nimage representation based on sparse representation over a couple (focused and blurred) of dictionaries. Sparse representations from different feature spaces are fused by obtaining joint sparse representation. The main difficulties to be addressed in such formulation are the coupled dictionary learning and fusion of corresponding sparse representations. In our conference paper [39], some initial results for the first contribution have been presented. • We develop a fusion procedure for finding and merging sparse vectors of coefficients, which\nrepresent focused and blurred image feature spaces defined by learned coupled dictionary. Such procedure forces to produce a higher quality all-in-focus image by using the plain averaging. This contribution differs from the previous approaches on the basis of the sparsity model used, i.e., a coupled dictionary is used for fusion. Furthermore, we introduce a local sparsity in a global Bayesian reconstruction framework of our fusion procedure. • We develop a K-SVD-based coupled dictionary learning algorithm by extending the well-\nknown K-SVD algorithm [28]. It explicitly enforces the requirement that sparse approximations evaluated for double feature spaces must generate an all-in-focus image using corresponding pair of dictionaries. Our optimization algorithm simultaneously learns the focused and blurred dictionaries under the joint sparse coding requirement in order to enforce correlation between the dictionaries. Such coupled dictionary learning algorithm alternates between the updates of dictionary atoms and sparse coding."

      "heading" : "II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION",
      "text" : "Consider the problem of constructing/reconstructing a high quality all-in-focus image IF from a set of multi-focus source images {Ik}Kk=1, which can be abstractly written in the form of the following fusing process\nIF = F {Ik}Kk=1 + V (2)\nwhere F{·} stands for a fusing operator and V is a zero-mean independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian additive noise matrix, with entries drawn at random from the normal distribution N (0, σ2). The fusion goal is to obtain IF from {Ik}Kk=1. Some further assumptions as to the capture of multiple images are the following. Each multi-focus image Ik is captured for the same scene and all multi-focus images are properly aligned. Note that the latter assumption is typical in the literature with a focus on image fusion algorithms design, but proper alignment of images is also an important practical issue. The problem of finding optimal fusing operator F {Ik}Kk=1 in (2) is an ill-posed problem in general. Therefore, different types of priors and regularizations have to be enforced and used.\nPatch-Sparsity Prior: Images are typically processed by patches.1 Image patches are easy to obtain from, for example, the all-in-focus image IF by multiplying the image with matrix Wi,j\n1It is because adapting a dictionary to large size images is impractical.\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n6 that extracts (i, j)-th patch from an image by means of sliding window (moving thrugh an image staring from the left-top corner of an image and moving to the right-bottom corner) technique. Formally, by multiplying IF with Wi,j , we obtain IFi,j = Wi,jI F. Then the image patch of the size d × d pixels IFi,j ∈ Rd×d is ordered lexicographically as a column vector and denoted as iFi,j ∈ Rd 2 . For notation simplicity and without loss of generality, we drop hereafter the indices (i, j) marking the patch position in an image and denote patches of k-th multi-focus image Ik and all-in-focus image IF just as ik ∈ Rd 2 and iF ∈ Rd2 , respectively.\nBase on the synthesis model, the patch iF can be represented as a linear combination of few atoms over an overcomplete dictionary D. Then the problem of seeking a sparse representation of iF over the dictionary D, i.e., the problem of finding sparse vector of coefficients α for atoms of D, is the same as problem (1). It can be written in the regularized form as\nmin α ∥∥Dα− iF∥∥2 2 + λ‖α‖1 (3)\nwhere λ is the regularization parameter and λ‖α‖1 is a regularization term enforcing sparsity of α. The dictionary here has to be learned in advance by using a training set of image patches or multiple training sets of image patches for images with different focuses.\nDouble Sparse Representation: Image patches in the multi-focus training sets can be sparsely represented by more than one overcomplete dictionary D. Specifically, for the problem of constructing an all-in-focus image from a set of available multi-focus images, it makes sense to consider a couple of overcomplete dictionaries, DF, DB ∈ Rd2×N of N atoms (N > d2), corresponding to focus and blurred image features, respectively. Then, sparse representations can be found for each dictionary using patch-sparsity prior.\nThe benefit of using a coupled dictionary {DF, DB} versus using a single focused dictionary DF only, as in the existing fusion approaches [19]–[25], [27], is the following. The use of a singly dictionary implies that the coupled features in each multi-focus patch ik are described by one indiscriminate linear combination of rows from DF. This description lacks flexibility in characterizing the blurred image structures that negatively reflects on reconstruction quality. The coupled dictionary {DF, DB} is expected to overcome this limitation by enabling a more accurate reconstruction in terms of directly considering the coupled features in each multi-focus patch. Merging multiple sparse vectors of coefficients for image patch representations over the dictionaries corresponding to focused and blurred feature spaces is then better than just selecting the sparsest representation over a single dictionary alone, because a combination of focused and\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n7\nblurred feature spaces gives a larger space and more degrees of freedom to the problem [41]. Of course, the problem of fusing such sparse representation of more than one dictionary then appears, and will be addressed in this paper.\nGlobal Reconstruction: After merging multiple sparse vectors of coefficients for image patch representation over the dictionaries corresponding to focused and blurred feature spaces and finding corresponding patches of the desired all-in-focus image, the global reconstruction still has to be performed to ensure proximity between the whole reconstructed all-in-focus image and the available multi-focus images {Ik}Kk=1. It is needed to make the entire reconstructed all-in-focus image consistent, and can be enforced by applying another type of regularization, which is the total variation regularization.\nSummarizing, Fig. 1 shows the block-diagram of the procedure for constructing/reconstructing an all-in-focus image IF from the given set of multi-focus images {Ik}Kk=1. In this block-diagram, the block “Patch extraction” represents the above described simple process of extracting patches\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n8 applied to the available multi-focus images {Ik}Kk=1. The input to the block “Coupled dictionary learning” is a the set of two available subsets of M training patches, i.e., {XF, XB}. HereXF ,[ xF1 ,x F 2 , · · · ,xFM ] ∈ Rd2×M and XB , [ xB1 ,x B 2 , · · · ,xBM ] ∈ Rd2×M are the subsets of available in-focus and blurred training patches, which can be extracted from actual images. The output of the block “Coupled dictionary learning” is the coupled dictionary {DF, DB} representing the in-focus and blurred image feature spaces. Section IV will be devoted to the coupled dictionary learning problem, which is otherwise decoupled from the image fusion problem addressed in the next section.\nThe procedure of fusing multi-focus images is presented in the block-diagram in Fig. 1 by three blocks. The block “Local optimal fusion with double sparsity prior” represents a procedure for finding and fusing vectors of sparse representations of patches of multi-focus images over the coupled dictionary {DF, DB}. Knowing the dictionaries and the fused sparse vector of coefficients, we can reconstruct all patches of the all-in-focus image and combine them together to an initial estimate of the all-in-focus image denoted as IF0 , which corresponds in Fig. 1 to the block “Combining patches to initial image estimate IF0 ”. Finally, the block “Global reconstruction with total variation regularization” represents a procedure of global all-in-focus image reconstruction."

This operator must generate a collection of sparse representations of image patches over the coupled dictionary {DF, DB}, and it can be expressed then as the following l1-norm minimization problem\nL{αk; ik} =argmin αk ‖αk‖1\ns.t. ∥∥DF · C {αFk ,αBk}− ik∥∥22 ≤ (7)\nwhere C { αFk ,α B k } is the operator applied to the sparse representations αFk and α B k over the\ncorresponding focused and blurred components of the coupled dictionary { DF,DB } and is a tolerance parameter of user’s choice that defines an acceptable representation accuracy. The\noperator C { αFk ,α B k } must provide the sparse vector of coefficients αk, and it can be, for example, the plain averaging of the sparse vectors αFk and α B k . Since the plain averaging is a separable function in DF and DB, problem (7) can be decomposed and separately solved with respect to αFk and α B k , and then followed by finding the plain average of α F k and α B k .

However, specifically for our fusing process, each coefficient from αFk and α B k represents its own significant salient structure, and merging these coefficients must form a more accurate fusion result, which can be achieved by randomization. In particular, the two vectors of competitive representations αFk and α B k in (8) can be found by randomized orthogonal matching pursuit (RandOMP) method [41], [42]. According\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n11\nto the RandOMP method as applied to (8), instead of adding the coefficients corresponding to the atoms (columns of DF and DB), denoted hereafter as dFt and d B t , respectively, to the\ncorresponding support sets Support { αFk } and Support { αBk } by checking the minimum errors ‖dFt αFk (t)− ik(t)‖22 and ‖d B t α B k (t)− ik(t)‖22, respectively, for all candidates indexed with t, the RandOMP method makes a random choice of candidates dFt and d B t . Here α F k (t) and α B k (t) stand for t-th elements of the vectors αFk and α B k , respectively, and ik(t) is the t-th pixel of ik. The method starts with assigning empty support sets to the supports of αFk and α B k , i.e.,\nSupport { αFk } = Support { αBk } = ∅; and assigning the residuals as r(0)F = r (0) B = ik. Then at each i-th iteration, atoms dFt and d B t are randomly and independently selected with probabilities proportional to exp{ c2 2σ2 |(dFt )Tr (l−1) F |2/‖d F t ‖22} and exp{ c 2 2σ2 |(dBt )Tr (l−1) B |2/‖d B t ‖22}, respectively.

Specifically for problem (14), the optimization variables can be split into two subsets of variables, where one subset includes the coupled dictionary {DF, DB}, and the other consists of the sparse coding matrix Γ. By addressing (14) in alternating manner, we first initialize/update and fix {DF, DB} and optimize (14) over Γ.

It alternates between the so-called sparse coding of the training set (when the coupled dictionary is fixed) and dictionary update (when the matrix of sparse coefficients is fixed) steps. The K-SVD algorithm is computationally more efficient than the above mentioned methods, however, its computational efficiency can be further improved by using some simplifying structures present in (14). Specifically, in the dictionary update step, while updating each atom, the standard K-SVD algorithm has to update all non-zero coefficients of a corresponding column of Γ. Moreover, Γ is updated again at the sparse coding step. To avoid some redundant updates, we can introduce a so-called mask matrix [48] that consists of zeros and ones, and aims to keep all the non-zero column elements intact. It can be done by adding the following constraint\nΓ M = 0 (15)\nto problem (14). Here, (i, j)-th element of the mask matrix M is defined as\nmi,j ,  1, if [Γ]i,j = 0 0, if [Γ]i,j 6= 0 . (16)\nThe dictionaries DF and DB capture the coherent structures of each corresponding individual feature space, and at the same time, describe correlation characteristics between the focused and blurred feature spaces. It facilitates the fusing process as explained in the previous section.\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n15\nOur algorithm for addressing problem (14) with additional constraint (15) in alternating matter will contain two stages: (i) coupled dictionary {DF,DB} update (atom by atom updates) for fixed Γ; and (ii) sparse coding for optimizing the matrix of joint sparse coefficients Γ for fixed coupled dictionary {DF, DB}."

Since the objective function of (14) is separable with respect to the dictionaries DF and DB, and different sets of constraints are applied to the atoms of DF and DB, (14) can be split into two subproblems of finding updates to the dictionaries DF and DB separately. The corresponding optimization problems are given as\nDF = argmin DF ∥∥∥∥∥XF − N∑ t=1 dFt γ T t ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\nF\n(17)\nDB = argmin DB ∥∥∥∥∥XB − N∑ t=1 dBt γ T t ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\nF\n(18)\nsubject to the constraints in (14) applicable to corresponding atoms.\nIn (17) and (18), we rewrite the products DFΓ and DBΓ as the sums of vector outer products. After such modification, it appears to be not necessary to update all atoms simultaneously. Instead each atom can be updated disjoint from the others. Thus, to update the atoms dFt and d B t , we fix the remaining atoms, and rewrite optimization problems (17) and (18) as\ndt F=argmin\ndFt\n∥∥∥∥∥ ( XF − ∑ s 6=t dFsγ T s ) Mt − dFt γTt ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\nF\n(19)\ndt B=argmin\ndBt\n∥∥∥∥∥ ( XB − ∑ s 6=t dBs γ T s ) Mt − dBt γTt ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\nF\n(20)\nwhere Mt is built by repeating d times t-th row of the mask matrix M, i.e., the row mTt . Using the mask matrix, all the columns of Γ, except t-th one, are removed, that is, XF −∑ s 6=t d F t γ T t and X B − ∑ s 6=t d B t γ T t , and only the atoms of D B and DF involved in the sparse representation picked by M are updated. Since redundant and unnecessary updates of irrelevant atoms is avoided, the computational complexity can be significantly reduced.

In particular, we first perform SVD for EFt and E B t , that is,\nEFt = U F t ∆ F t V F t\n(23)\nEBt = U B t ∆ B t V B t . (24)\nThen the updated atoms dFt and d B t are given by the principal left singular vectors (first columns) of UBt and U B t , respectively. Also the product of the first column of V F t with the largest/first singular value in ∆Ft and the product of the first column of V B t with the first singular value in ∆Bt can be viewed as two non-sparse versions of γ T t ."

At q-th iteration, the following optimization problem is solved\nγ (q+1) t = argmin γt G(γt,γ (q) t ) (28)\nwhere G(γt,γ (q) t ) is a surrogate function for the function f(γt) at the point γ (q) t , for which the conditions G(γ(q)t ,γ (q) t ) = f(γ (q) t ) and G(γt,γ (q) t ) ≥ f(γt) are satisfied.\nSelecting G(γt,γ (q) t ) as\nG(γt,γ(q)t ),∇Tγtf1(γ (q) t )γt+\n1 2 ∥∥∥γt − γ(q)t ∥∥∥2 2 +f2(γt) (29)\nthe update rule for γt can be found to be\nγ (q+1) t =γ (q) t −S λ\nT 2(dt)\n{ γ (q) t −\n1\nT 2(dt) dTt\n( dt(γ (q) t ) T −Et )} .

Also note that with respect to f1(γt) only, the selection of G(γt,γ (q) t ) as (29) is the same as in the well-known mirror descent method. Therefore, (30) can be interpreted as a modified mirror descent for a composite objective function containing convex smooth, i.e., f1(γt), and convex non-smooth, i.e., f2(γt), parts, where we have the proximal soft thresholding operator due to the sparsity enforcing part f2(γt).\n2We drop for simplicity the transpose of γt, but always mean that we work with rows of Γ.\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n18"

We then discuss various factors that influence the performance including patch size, tolerance error, and number of overlapping pixels between neighboring patches. In addition, we test different approaches in terms of robustness to noise for different noise levels.\nThe quantitative assessments are based on two state-of-the-art fusion performance metrics.\n• The measure of how well the mutual information from the source images is preserved in\nthe fused image, denoted as QMI [52];\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n19\n• The measure of how well the success of edge information transfers from the source images\nto the fused image, denored as, QAB/F [53].\nThe proposed approach is compared to the following existing state-of-the-art multi-focus image\nfusion algorithms.\n• LP: Laplacian pyramid-based image fusion approach [14]; • MWG: multi-scale weighted gradient-based spatial image fusion approach [16]; • DWT: discrete wavelet transform-based image fusion approach [17]; • NSCT: non-subsampled contourlet transform-based image fusion approach [18]; • RPCA: robust principal component analysis-based image fusion approach [1]; • SR-CM: sparse representation “choose-max”-based image fusion approach [23]; • SR-KSVD: sparse representation K-SVD-based image fusion approach.\nThroughout all experiments, the parameter used in the methods tested are set as follows. For the LP and DWT methods, the source images are decomposed to 3 levels. The wavelet basis “db1” is applied in the DWT algorithm. For the NSCT approach, the direction numbers at 4 decomposition levels from coarse to fine are selected as 4, 8, 8, and 16 for levels 1 to 4, respectively. For fair comparison, all algorithms based on sparsity model are implemented using the same dictionary size. For the proposed method, the tolerance error is set to = 0.1, the patch size is equal to 82, and the overlapping length between neighboring patches is 1. For the coupled dictionary learning, the training sets of focused image patches of size 82 consisting of 50,000 patches taken from the USC-SIPI image database [55] of 40 natural images, and 50,000 blurred patches of the same size, which are created from focused patches using Gaussian blur function, are used. The coupled dictionaries is then learned by Algorithm 2. Randomly selected patches from the training sets of focused and blurred sets of patches are used as initialization. The coupled dictionary size is selected to be 64× 256 as a reasonable tradeoff between fusion quality and computation, while in general larger size dictionary results in heavier computation, but better fusion quality. Also for coupled dictionary learning, we execute 6 multiple dictionary update cycles (DUC) and 30 iterations per DUC. All our experiments are performed on a PC running a Inter(R) Xeon(R) 3.40GHz CPU.\nB. Visual Comparison\nWe conduct our fusion experiments over the standard multi-focus dataset [54], and show some representative fusion results in Figs. 2 and 3. All the figures also include the magnified details of\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n20\nthe images in the lower right corners. Figs. 2(a) and (b) show the source images, and the fused images obtained by different fusion methods tested are presented in Figs. 2(c)-(j). The same order of images and reconstructions obtained by different methods is also used in the Fig. 3. By inspecting the results visually, we can see that the LP method does not produce continuous\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n21\nedges (see Fig. 2(c)) and the DWT method results in blocking artifacts (see Fig. 2(e)). The same results for these two methods can be more clearly seen in the magnified sections of the images. The fusion methods based on MWG (see Fig. 2(d)) and NSCT (see Fig. 2(f)) show circle blurring effect around strong boundaries, while Fig. 2(f) appears visually better than Fig. 2(d). In Figs. 2(g) and (i), some artificial distortions can be seen, while Fig. 2(h) obviously lacks edge information. Our approach provides the best visual appearance (see Fig. 2(j)). Note that\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n22\nsimilar visual subjective results are consistently obtained in our experiments with all the images tested including the other representative images shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed approach yields better all-in-focus image quality than other tested methods, including state-of-the-art methods.\nIn addition to the visual comparisons, Table I summarizes the quantitative evaluations of different methods tested on the above grayscale multi-focus images in terms of QMI , QAB/F , and the running time (in seconds). The performance measures QMI and QAB/F range from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the ideal fusion. The one bold value per each column of the table depicts the best result for a specific performance measure by a corresponding method. It can be seen from Table I that the proposed approach generally produces better quantitative results in terms of QMI and QAB/F . The value of QMI for the proposed approach is always larger than for the LP, MWG, DWT, NSCT, and SR-CM methods, and it is also better than for the\nMay 31, 2017 DRAFT\n23\nmethods based on RPCA and SR-KSVD. Therefore, the proposed approach as well as RPCA and SR-KSVD preserve well the mutual information from different source images. The values of QAB/F demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the blocking artifacts and artificial distortions, and combines the significant edge information into the fused image. Comparing the running time, it can be seen that the SR-CM, SR-KSVD, and proposed methods require more time than the other methods tested."

Figs. 4– 6 show respectively the average values of QMI , QAB/F , and the running time for different values of pitch size, tolerance error, and overlapping length. We also give the corresponding parameter values for all the methods in the caption.\nIt can be seen in Figs. 4(a) and (b) that both QMI and QAB/F are slightly better when the patch size is larger. As the patch size increases, the running time also increases (see Fig. 4(c)) for the proposed as well as for the SR-CM and SR-KSVD methods at about the same rate, while the SR-KSVD shows the worst time. Therefore, by trying to balance the computation time and fusion quality, we have set the patch size to 82 in our above reported experiments. It can be also seen in Fig. 5 that as the tolerance error increases, all the three methods tested here show degradation, as expected, in QMI and QAB/F , while the running time slightly reduces. Yet, the proposed method shows better results than the other two methods tested here. The results in Fig. 6 show that with the increase of the overlapping length between neighboring patches, QMI decreases, while the running time increases for all three methods tested here. The proposed method still show the best results. Therefore, we have set the overlapping size as p = 1 in our above experiments."

Using the coupled dictionary from the focused and blurred feature spaces, we have develop an efficient and accurate fusing approach, and have demonstrated that the proposed approach well preserves the edge and structural information of source images; drastically reduces the blocking artifacts, circle blurring, and artificial distortions; and shows in general better results than the existing fusion methods including state-of-the-art methods."

Algorithms for this problem necessarily admit the source image characteristics along with focused and blurred feature. However, most sparsity-based approaches use a single dictionary in focused feature space to describe multi-focus images, and ignore the representations in blurred feature space. Here, we propose a multi-focus image fusion approach based on coupled sparse representation. The approach exploits the facts that (i) the patches in given training set can be sparsely represented by a couple of overcomplete dictionaries related to the focused and blurred categories of images; and (ii) merging such representations leads to a more flexible and therefore better fusion strategy than the one based on just selecting the sparsest representation in the original image estimate. By jointly learning the coupled dictionary, we enforce the similarity of sparse representations in the focused and blurred feature spaces, and then introduce a fusion approach to combine these representations for generating an all-in-focus image. We also discuss the advantages of the fusion approach based on coupled sparse representation and present an efficient algorithm for learning the coupled dictionary. Extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion algorithms validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
