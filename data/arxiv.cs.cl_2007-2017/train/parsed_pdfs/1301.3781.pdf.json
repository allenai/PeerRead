      "text" : "Many current NLP systems and techniques treat words as atomic units. This choice has several good reasons - simplicity, robustness and the observation that simple models trained on huge amounts of data outperform complex systems trained on less data. However, with recent progress in machine learning and the increase of computational power, the simple techniques are at their limits in many tasks. An example is the popular N-gram model used for statistical language modeling - today, it is possible to train these models on virtually all available data (trillions of words [3]).\nIn recent years, it has become possible to train more complex models on much larger data set, and they typically outperform the simple models. For example, neural network language models trained on a few hundred million words significantly outperform N-gram models trained on the same data [13]. For many tasks, the amount of relevant in-domain data is actually limited - speech recognition performance is usually dominated by the size of high quality transcribed speech data (millions of words). In machine translation, the existing corpora for many languages contain only a few billions of words or less. Thus, we are in a situation where simple scaling up of the basic techniques will not result in any significant progress, and we have to focus on more advanced techniques.\nIn this paper, we focus on the increasingly popular technique of representing words in a continuous vector space, which may overcome data sparsity problems that arise when words are treated as atomic units. A good motivation for considering continuous vector representations of words might be statistical language modeling, because similar words can share parameters, which leads to more robust estimation of the parameters during training. Compared to N-gram models that treat each\nword as an atomic unit, this approach gives significantly better results [1]. Language models based on these techniques are currently the state of the art [11]."

      "heading" : "1.1 Previous work",
      "text" : "Representation of words as continuous vectors has a long history [17, 6]. A very popular model architecture for estimating word vectors was proposed in [1], where a feedforward neural network with a linear projection layer and a non-linear hidden layer was used to learn jointly the word vector representation and a statistical language model. This work has been followed by many others - it was shown later that the word vectors can be used to significantly improve and simplify many NLP applications [5]. Estimation of the word vectors itself was performed using different model architectures and trained on various corpora [4, 18, 15, 13, 7], and some of the resulting word vectors were made available for future research and comparison1."

      "heading" : "1.2 Goals of the Paper",
      "text" : "We propose two new architectures for estimating continuous word vectors. We use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representations, with the expectation that not only will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that words can have multiple degrees of similarity [14]. This has been observed earlier in the context of inflectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to find words that have similar endings [8].\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are performed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector(”King”) - vector(”Man”) + vector(”Woman”) results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen [14].\nIn this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by designing new model architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words. We design a new comprehensive test set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities, and show that many such regularities can be learned with high accuracy. Moreover, we discuss hyper-parameter selection, so that highquality word vectors can be estimated efficiently even from data sets with billions of words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary."

      "heading" : "2 Model Architectures",
      "text" : "Many different types of models were proposed for estimating continuous representations of words, including the well-known Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In this paper, we focus on neural network architectures, as it was previously shown that they perform significantly better than LSA for preserving linear regularities among words [14]; LDA moreover becomes computationally very expensive on large data sets.\nSimilar to Mikolov et al. [12], to compare different model architectures we define first the computational complexity of a model as the number of parameters that need to be accessed to fully train the model. Next, we will try to maximize the accuracy, while minimizing the computational complexity.\nFor all the following models, the training complexity is proportional to\nO = E × T ×Q, (1)\nwhere E is number of the training epochs, T is the number of the words in the training set and Q is defined further for each model architecture. Common choice is E = 3− 50 and T up to one billion. All models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation [17].\n1http://ronan.collobert.com/senna/ http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/ http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/˜imikolov/rnnlm/ http://ai.stanford.edu/˜ehhuang/"

      "heading" : "2.1 Feedforward Neural Net Language Model (NNLM)",
      "text" : "The probabilistic feedforward neural network language model has been proposed in [1]. It consists of input, projection, hidden and output layers. At the input layer, N previous words are encoded using 1-of-V coding, where V is size of the vocabulary. The input layer is then projected to a projection layer P that has dimensionality N × D, using a shared projection matrix. As only N inputs are active at any given time, composition of the projection layer is a relatively cheap operation.\nThe NNLM architecture becomes complex for computation between the projection and the hidden layer, as values in the projection layer are dense. For a common choice of N = 10, the size of the projection layer (P ) might be 500 to 2000, while the hidden layer size H is typically 500 to 1000 units. Moreover, the hidden layer is used to compute probability distribution over all the words in the vocabulary, resulting in an output layer with dimensionality V . Thus, the computational complexity per each training example is\nQ = N ×D +N ×D ×H +H × V, (2)\nwhere the dominating term is H × V . However, several practical solutions were proposed for avoiding it; either using hierarchical versions of the softmax [16, 15, 12], or avoiding normalized models completely by using models that are not normalized during training [4, 7]. With binary tree representations of the vocabulary, the number of output units that need to be evaluated can go down to around log2(V ). Thus, most of the complexity is caused by the term N ×D ×H .\nIn our models, we use hierarchical softmax where the vocabulary is represented as a Huffman binary tree. This follows previous observations that the frequency of words works well for obtaining classes in neural net language models [10]. Huffman trees assign short binary codes to frequent words, and this further reduces the number of output units that need to be evaluated: while balanced binary tree would require log2(V ) outputs to be evaluated, the Huffman tree based hierarchical softmax requires only about log2(Unigram perplexity(V )). For example when the vocabulary size is one million words, this results in about two times speedup in evaluation. While this is not crucial speedup for neural network LMs as the computational bottleneck is in the N×D×H term, we will later propose architectures that do not have hidden layers and thus depend heavily on the efficiency of the softmax normalization."

      "heading" : "2.2 Recurrent Neural Net Language Model (RNNLM)",
      "text" : "Recurrent neural network based language model has been proposed to overcome certain limitations of the feedforward NNLM, such as the need to specify the context length (the order of the model N ), and because theoretically RNNs can efficiently represent more complex patterns than the shallow neural networks [9, 2]. The RNN model does not have a projection layer; only input, hidden and output layer. What is special for this type of model is the recurrent matrix that connects hidden layer to itself, using time-delayed connections. This allows the recurrent model to form some kind of short term memory, as information from the past can be represented by the hidden layer state that gets updated based on the current input and the state of the hidden layer in the previous time step.\nThe complexity per training example of the RNN model is\nQ = H ×H +H × V, (3)\nwhere the word representations D have the same dimensionality as the hidden layer H . Again, the term H × V can be efficiently reduced to H × log2(V ) by using hierarchical softmax. Most of the complexity then comes from H ×H ."

The main observation from the previous section was that most of the complexity is caused by the non-linear hidden layer in the model. While this is what makes neural networks so attractive, we decided to explore simpler models that might not be able to represent the data as precisely as neural networks, but can possibly be trained on much more data efficiently."

      "heading" : "3.1 Continuous Bag-of-Words Model",

We call this architecture a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the history does not influence the projection. Furthermore, we also use words from the future; we have obtained the best performance on the task introduced in the next section by building a log-linear classifier with four future and four history words at the input, where the training criterion is to correctly classify the current (middle) word. Training complexity is then\nQ = N ×D +D × log2(V ). (4)\nWe denote this model further as CBOW."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 Continuous Skip-gram Model",
      "text" : "The second architecture is similar to CBOW, but instead of predicting the current word based on the context, it tries to maximize classification of a word based on another word in the same sentence. More precisely, we use each current word as an input to a log-linear classifier with continuous projection layer, and predict words within a certain range before and after the current word. We found that increasing the range improves quality of the resulting word vectors, but it also increases the computational complexity. Since the more distant words are usually less related to the current word than those close to it, we give less weight to the distant words by sampling less from those words in our training examples.\nThe training complexity of this architecture is proportional to\nQ = C × (D +D × log2(V )), (5)\nwhere C is the maximum distance of the words. Thus, if we choose C = 5, for each training word we will select randomly a number R in range < 1;C >, and then use R words from history and R words from the future of the current word as correct labels. This will require us to do R × 2 word classifications, with the current word as input, and each of the R +R words as output. In the following experiments, we use C = 10."

      "heading" : "4 Results",
      "text" : "To compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table showing example words and their most similar words, and understand them intuitively. Although it is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much more challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We follow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for example, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example of another type of relationship can be word pairs big - biggest and small - smallest [14]. We further denote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: ”What is the word that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?”\nSomewhat surprisingly, these questions can be answered by performing simple algebraic operations with the vector representation of words. To find a word that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big, we can simply compute vector X = vector(”biggest”)− vector(”big”)+ vector(”small”). Then, we search in the vector space for the word closest to X measured by cosine distance, and use it as the answer to the question. When the word vectors are well trained, it is possible to find the correct answer (word smallest) using this method.\nFinally, we found that when we train high dimensional word vectors on a large amount of data, the resulting vectors can be used to answer very subtle semantic relationships between words, such as a city and the country it belongs to, e.g. France is to Paris as Germany is to Berlin. Word vectors with such semantic relationships could be used to improve many existing NLP applications, such as machine translation, information retrieval and question answering systems, and may enable other future applications yet to be invented. We intend to publish a set of high quality word vectors trained on large amounts of data later."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.1 Task Description",
      "text" : "To measure quality of the word vectors, we define a comprehensive test set that contains five types of semantic questions, and nine types of syntactic questions. Two examples from each category are shown in Table 1. Overall, there are 8869 semantic and 10675 syntactic questions. The questions in each category were created in two steps: first, a list of similar word pairs was created manually. Then, a large list of questions is formed by connecting two word pairs. For example, we made a list of 68 large American cities and the states they belong to, and formed about 2.5K questions by picking two word pairs at random. We have included in our test set only single token words, thus multi-word entities are not present (such as New York). We plan to publish the test set soon, so that other researchers can use it in their experiments.\nWe evaluate the overall accuracy for all question types, and for each question type separately (semantic, syntactic). Question is assumed to be correctly answered only if the closest word to the vector computed using the above method is exactly the same as the correct word in the question; synonyms are thus counted as mistakes. This also means that reaching 100% accuracy is likely to be impossible, as the current models do not have any input information about word morphology. However, we believe that usefulness of the word vectors for certain applications should be positively correlated with this accuracy metric. Further progress can be achieved by incorporating information about structure of words, especially for the syntactic questions."

      "heading" : "4.2 Maximization of Accuracy",
      "text" : "We have used a Google News corpus for training the word vectors. This corpus contains about 6B tokens. We have restricted the vocabulary size to 1 million most frequent words. Clearly, we are facing time constrained optimization problem, as it can be expected that both using more data and higher dimensional word vectors will improve the accuracy. To estimate the best choice of hyper-parameters for obtaining as good as possible results quickly, we have first evaluated models trained on subsets of the training data, with vocabulary restricted to the most frequent 30k words. The results using the CBOW architecture with different choice of word vector dimensionality and increasing amount of the training data are shown in Table 2.\nIt can be seen that after some point, adding more dimensions or adding more training data provides diminishing improvements. So, we have to increase both vector dimensionality and the amount of the training data together. While this observation might seem trivial, it must be noted that it is\ncurrently popular to train word vectors on relatively large amounts of data, but with insufficient size (such as 50 - 100). Given Equation 4, increasing amount of training data twice results in about the same increase of computational complexity as increasing vector size twice.\nFor the experiments reported in Tables 2 and 3, we used three training epochs with stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation. We chose starting learning rate 0.025 and decreased it linearly, so that it approaches zero at the end of the last training epoch."

We also included word vectors derived from a feedforward NNLM similar to [1], trained on a larger Google News corpus using about one hundred machine cores in parallel over a period of about two weeks. The comparison is given in Table 3. The CBOW model was trained on subset of the Google News data in about a day, while training time for the skip-gram log-linear model was about three days.\nFor experiments reported further, we use just one training epoch (again, we decrease learning rate linearly so that it approaches zero at the end of training), as we have more training data than we can efficiently process. Training model on twice more data using one epoch gives comparable or\nbetter results than iterating over the same data for three epochs, as is shown in Table 4, and provides additional speedup."

      "heading" : "5 Examples of the Learned Relationships",
      "text" : "Table 5 shows words that follow various relationships. We follow the approach described above: the relationship is defined by subtracting two word vectors, and the result is added to another word. Thus for example, France - Paris + Italy = Rome. As it can be seen, accuracy is quite good, although there is clearly a lot of room for further improvements. We believe that word vectors trained on even larger data sets with larger dimensionality will perform significantly better, and will enable the development of new innovative applications. Another way to improve accuracy is to provide more than one example of the relationship. By using ten examples instead of one, we have observed improvement of accuracy of our best models by about 10% absolutely on the semantic-syntactic test.\nIt is also possible to apply the vector operations to solve different tasks. For example, we have observed good accuracy for selecting out-of-the-list words, by computing average vector for a list of words, and finding the most distant word vector. This is a popular type of problems in certain human intelligence tests. Clearly, there is still a lot of discoveries to be made using these techniques."

      "text" : "In this paper we studied quality of vector representations of words derived by various models. We found that it is possible to train high quality word vectors using very simple model architectures, compared to the popular neural network models (both feedforward and recurrent). Because of the much lower computational complexity, we hope that it will be possible to compute very accurate high dimensional word vectors from a much larger data set. We intend to publish a set of high quality word vectors in the future.\nIn the future, it would be interesting to compare our techniques to Latent Relational Analysis [19] and others. Also, application to certain previously proposed problems such as sentence completion [20] seems appealing. We believe that our comprehensive test set will help the research community to improve the existing techniques for estimating word vectors. We also hope that high quality word vectors will become an important building block for future NLP applications."

We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day and one CPU to derive high quality 300-dimensional vectors for one million vocabulary from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring various types of word similarities. We intend to publish this test set to be used by the research community.",
