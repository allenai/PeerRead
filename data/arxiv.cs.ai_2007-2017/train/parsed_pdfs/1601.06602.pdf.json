      "text" : "We present a novel algorithm for anomaly detection on very large datasets and data streams. The method, named EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE), is kernel-based and able to efficiently compute the similarity between new data points and the distribution of regular data. The estimator is formulated as an inner product with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space embedding and makes no assumption about the type or shape of the underlying data distribution. We show that offline (batch) learning with EXPoSE can be done in linear time and online (incremental) learning takes constant time per instance and model update. Furthermore, EXPoSE can make predictions in constant time, while it requires only constant memory. In addition, we propose different methodologies for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. On several real datasets we demonstrate that our approach can compete with state of the art algorithms for anomaly detection while being an order of magnitude faster than most other approaches."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "What is an anomaly? An anomaly is an element whose properties differ from the majority of other elements under consideration which are called the normal data. “Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior. These non-conforming patterns are often referred to as anomalies [. . .]” (Chandola et al, 2009).\nTypical applications of anomaly detection are network intrusion detection, credit card fraud detection, medical diagnosis and failure detection in industrial environments. For example, systems which detect unusual network behavior can be used to complement or replace traditional intrusion detection methods which are based on experts’ knowledge in order to defeat the increasing number of attacks on computer based networks (Kumar, 2005). Credit card transactions which differ significantly from the usual shopping behavior of the card owner can indicate that the credit card was stolen or a compromise of data associated with the account occurred (Aleskerov et al,\nα Institute of Neural Information Processing, University of Ulm, Germany β Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Ravensburg-Weingarten University of Applied Sciences, Germany γ School of Information Technologies, The University of Sydney, Australia This is an extended and revised version of a preliminary conference report that was presented in the International\nJoint Conference on Neural Networks 2015 (Schneider et al, 2015). The final publication is available at Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-016-5567-7\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n06 60\n2v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 6\nJ un\n2 01\n1997). The diagnosis of radiographs can be supported by automated systems to detect breast cancers in mammographic image analysis (Spence et al, 2001). Unplanned downtime of production lines caused by failing components is a serious concern in many industrial environments. Here anomaly detection can be used to detect unusual sensor information to predict possible faults and enabling condition-based maintenance (Zhang et al, 2011). Novelty detection can be used to detect new interesting or unusual galaxies in astronomical data such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Xiong et al, 2011).\nObtaining labeled training data for all types of anomalies is often too expensive. Imagine the labeling has to be done by a human expert or is obtained through costly experiments (Hodge and Austin, 2004). In some applications anomalies are also very rare as in air traffic safety or space missions. Hence, the problem of anomaly detection is typically unsupervised, however it is implicitly assumed that the dataset contains only very few anomalies. This assumption is reasonable since it is quite often possible to collect large amounts of data for the normal state of a system as, for example usual credit card transactions or network traffic of a system not under attack.\nThe computational complexity and memory requirements of classical algorithms become the limiting factor when applied to large-scale datasets as they occur nowadays. To solve this problem we propose a new anomaly detection algorithm called EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE). As explained later in detail, the EXPoSE anomaly detection classifier\nη(z) = 〈φ(z),µ[P]〉\ncalculates a score (the likelihood of z belonging to the class of normal data) using the inner product between a feature map φ and the kernel mean map µ[P] of the distribution of normal data P. We will show that this inner product can be evaluated in constant time, while µ[P] can be estimated in linear time, has constant memory consumption and is designed to solve very large-scale anomaly detection problems.\nMoreover, we will see that the proposed EXPoSE classifier can be learned incrementally making it applicable to online and streaming anomaly detection problems. Learning on data streams directly is unavoidable in many applications such as network traffic monitoring, video surveillance and document feeds as data arrives continuously in fast streams with a volume too large or impractical to store.\nOnly a few anomaly detection algorithms can be applied to large-scale problems and even less are applicable to streaming data. The proposed EXPoSE anomaly detector fills this gap.\nour main contributions are:\n• We present an efficient anomaly detection algorithm, called EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE), with O(n) training time, O(1) prediction time and only O(1) memory requirements with respect to the dataset size n.\n• We show that EXPoSE is especially suitable for parallel and distributed processing which makes it scalable to very large problems.\n• We demonstrate how EXPoSE can be applied to online and streaming anomaly detection, while requiring only O(1) time for a model update, O(1) time per prediction and O(1) memory.\n• We introduce two different approaches which allow EXPoSE to be efficiently used with the most common techniques for concept drift adaptation.\n• We evaluate EXPoSE on several real datasets, including surveillance, image data and network intrusion detection.\nThis paper is organised as follows: We first provide a formal problem description including a definition of batch and streaming anomaly detection. Section 3 provides an overview of related work and a comparison of these techniques. Section 4 introduces the EXPoSE anomaly detection algorithm along with the necessary theoretical framework. Subsequently we show in Section 5 how EXPoSE can be applied to streaming anomaly detection problems. The key to EXPoSE s computational performance is subject to Section 6. In Section 7 we empirically compare EXPoSE with several state of the art anomaly detectors."

      "heading" : "2 Problem Definition",
      "text" : "Even though there is a vast amount of literature on anomaly detection, there is no unique definition of what anomalies are and what exactly anomaly detection is. In this section we will state the problem of anomaly detection in batch and streaming applications.\nDefinition 1 (Input Space): The input space for an observation X is a measurable space1 (X, X ) containing all values that X might take. We denote the realization after measurement of the random variable X with X = x. «\nWe make no assumptions about the nature of the input space X which can consist of simple numerical vectors, but also can contain images, video data or trajectories of vehicles and people. We assume that there is a true (but unknown) distribution PX : X → [0, 1] of the data. Definition 2 (Output/Label Space): In anomaly detection an observation X = x can belong to the class of normal data cn or can be an anomaly ca. This is called label of the observation and denoted by the random variable Y. The collection of all labels is given by the measurable space (Y, Y ) called label space or output space (Fig. 2). «\nThe distribution of the observation x ∈ X is stochastic and depends on the label Y and hence is distributed according to PX|Y .\nDefinition 3 (Prediction/Decision Space): Based on the outcome X = x of an observation, the objective of an anomaly detection algorithm is to make a prediction ϑ ∈ Q, where the measurable space (Q, Q) is called the prediction space or sometimes decision space. «\n1A measurable space is a tuple (X, X ), where X is a nonempty set and X is a σ-algebra of its subsets. We refer the reader unfamiliar with this topic to Kallenberg (2006) for an overview.\nThe prediction space Q is not necessarily equal to label space Y. Especially in anomaly detection and classification many algorithms calculate a probability or a score for a label. Such a score is called anomaly score if it quantifies the likelihood of x belonging to ca and normal score if it determines the degree of certainty to which x belongs to cn.\nScoring based algorithms are more flexible than techniques which assign hard class labels since anomalies can be ranked and prioritized according their score or a domain specific discrimination threshold can be applied to separate anomalies from normal data. For example we can define a mapping τ : (Q, Q)→ (Y, Y ) as\nτθ(ϑ) = { cn if ϑ > θ ca else\nbased on the threshold θ. Such a domain specific threshold depends on the costs of false positives (an anomaly is reported when the observation is normal) and false negatives (no anomaly is reported when the observation is anomalous).\nDefinition 4 (Classifier/Predictor): A measurable function η : (X, X )→ (Q, Q) is called a classifier or predictor. «\nA classifier calculates a prediction for an observation X = x. In the context of anomaly detection our goal is to find a good predictor which can distinguish normal from anomalous data. However, the distribution PX ⊗PY is typically unknown and hence we have to build a classifier solely based on observations. The estimation of such a functional relationship between the input space X and the prediction space Q is called learning or training.\nDefinition 5 (Batch Anomaly Detection): In unsupervised batch learning we have access to n ∈ N unlabeled independent realizations (x1, . . . , xn), identically distributed according to ⊗ni=1PX which form a training set. In anomaly detection we make the following assumptions:\n• The objective is to estimate a predictor η based on an unlabeled training set.\n• The training set contains mostly normal instances from PX|Y=cn and only a few anomalies as, by definition, anomalies are rare events.\n• It is assumed that the algorithm has complete access to all n elements of the dataset at once.\n• We may have access to a small labeled fraction of the training data to configure our algorithm. «\nDefinition 6 (Online & Streaming Anomaly Detection): In contrast to batch learning, where the full dataset (x1, . . . , xn) is permanently available, online learning algorithms observe each xt, (1 6 t 6 n) only once and in a sequential order. Typically these algorithms have limited memory and thus can only store a small set of previously observed samples. Hence it is necessary to continuously update the prediction function based on the new observations\n(xt,ηt) 7→ ηt+1\nto build a new predictor. This can be generalized to streaming anomaly detection where data arrives in a possible infinite sequence x1, x2, x3, . . . of observations. Moreover the input and label space distributions may evolve over time, a problem known as concept drift. (Formally we now have to consider the stochastic processes {Xt}t∈N, {Yt}t∈N and their corresponding distributions). It is therefore necessary that an algorithm can adapt to the changes e.g. by forgetting outdated information while incorporating new knowledge (Gama et al, 2014). These classes of algorithms assume that more recent observations carry more relevant information than older data. In summary streaming anomaly detection has the following key characteristics:\n• The data stream is possible infinite which requires the algorithm to learn incrementally since it is not possible to store the whole stream.\n• Most instances in the data stream belong to the class of normal data and anomalies are rare.\n• The stream can evolve over time, forcing algorithms to adapt to changes in the data distribution.\n• Only a small time frame at the beginning of the stream is available to configure the algorithm’s parameter.\n• We have to instantly make a prediction ηt(xt) as soon as an observation xt is available. This requires that predictions can be made fast. «"

      "text" : "One of the oldest, statistical methods for anomaly detection is the kernel (or Parzen) density estimator (kde). With O(n) time for predictions the kde is too slow for large amounts of data and known to be problematic in the case of increasing data dimensionality (Gretton et al, 2012). Fitting parametric distributions such as the Normal, Gamma, etc. is problematic since in general, the underlying data distribution is unknown. Therefore, a mixture of Gaussians is often used as a surrogate for the true distribution as, for example, done by SmartSifter (Yamanishi et al, 2004). SmartSifter can handle multivariate data with both, continuous and categorical observations. The\nmain disadvantage of this approach is the high number of parameters required for the mixture model which grows quadratically with the dimension (Tax, 2001)."

      "heading" : "3.2 DISTANCE BASED MODELS",
      "text" : "Distance based models are popular since most of them are easy to implement and interpret. Knorr et al. (Knorr and Ng, 1998; Knorr et al, 2000) labels an observation as a distance based outlier (anomaly) if at least a fraction of points in the dataset have a distance of more than a threshold (based on the fraction) to this point. The authors proposed two simple algorithms which have both O(n2) runtime and a cell-based version which runs linear in n, but exponential with the dimension d. Ramaswamy et al (2000) argues that the threshold can be difficult to determine and proposes an outlier score which is simply the distance from a query point to its kth nearest neighbor. The algorithm is called KNNOutlier and suffers from the problem of efficient nearest neighbor search. If the input space is of low dimension and n is much larger than 2d then finding 1 nearest neighbor in a k-d tree with randomly distributed points takes O(logn) time on average. However this does not hold in high dimensions, where such a tree is not better than an exhaustive search with O(n) (Goodman and O’Rourke, 2004). Also the algorithm proposed by Ramaswamy et al. is only used to identify the top outliers in a given dataset. An alternative algorithm was proposed by Angiulli et al. (Angiulli and Pizzuti, 2002) using the sum of distances from its k-nearest neighbors. Ott et al (2014) simultaneously perform clustering and anomaly detection in an integer programming optimization task.\nPopular approaches from data mining for distance based novelty detection on streams are olindda (Spinosa et al, 2007) and its extension minas (Faria et al, 2013) which both represent normal data as a union of spheres obtained by clustering. This representation becomes problematic if data within one cluster exhibits high variance since then the decision boundary becomes too large to detect novelties. Both algorithms are designed to incorporate novel classes into their model of normal data and hence barely applicable to anomaly detection.\nThe STream OutlieR Miner (storm) (Angiulli and Fassetti, 2010, 2007) offers an efficient solution to the problem of distance-based outlier detection over windowed data streams using a new data structure called Indexed Stream Buffer. Continuous Outlier Detection (cod) (Kontaki et al, 2011) aims to further improve the efficiency of storm by reducing the number of range queries."

      "text" : "Nearest neighbor data description (Tax, 2001) approximates a local density while using only distances to its first neighbor. The algorithm is very simple and often used as a baseline. It is also relatively slow approaching O(n) per prediction. More sophisticated is the local density based approach called Local Outlier Factor (lof) (Breunig et al, 2000). It considers a point to be an anomaly if there are only relatively few other points in its neighborhood. lof was extended to work on data streams (Pokrajac, 2007), however both (the batch and incremental approach) are relatively slow with training time between O(n logn) and O(n2) and O(n) memory consumption.\nThe angle based outlier detection for high-dimensional data (abod) proposed by Kriegel and Zimek (Kriegel and Zimek, 2008) is able to outperform lof, however requires O(n2) time per prediction with the exact model and O(n+ k2) if the full dataset is replaced by the k-nearest neighbors of the query point (FastAbod)."

      "text" : "The One-class support vector machine (oc-svm) (Schölkopf et al, 2001; Tax and Duin, 2004) is a kernel based method which attempts to find a hyperplane such that most of the observations are separated from the origin with maximum margin. This approach does not scale very well to large datasets where predictions have to be made with high frequency. As, Steinwart (2003) showed that the number of support vectors can grow linearly in the size of the dataset. There exist One-class support vector machines which can be learned incrementally (Gretton and Desobry, 2003).\nHoeffding Trees (Domingos and Hulten, 2000) are anytime decision trees to mine high-speed data streams. The Hoeffding Trees algorithm is not applicable to solve the unsupervised anomaly detection problem considered in this work since it requires the availability of class labels. Streaming Half-Space-Trees (hsta) (Tan et al, 2011) randomly construct a binary tree structure without any data. It selects a dimension at random and splits it in half. Each tree then counts the number of instances from the training set at each node referred to as “mass”. The score for a new instance is then proportional to the mass in the leaf in which new instance hits after passing down the tree. Obviously, an ensemble of such trees can be built-in constant time and the training is linear in n. However, randomly splitting a very high-dimensional space will not yield in a tree sufficiently fine-grained for anomaly detection. The RS-Forest (Wu et al, 2014) is a modification of hsta in which each dimension is not splitted in half, but at a random cut-point. Also the assumption that “[. . .] once each instance is scored, streaming RS-Forest will receive the true label of the instance [. . .]” (Wu et al, 2014) does not always hold. The Isolation Forest (iForest) is an algorithm which uses a tree structure to isolate instances (Liu et al, 2012). The anomaly score is based on the path length to an instance. iForests achieve a constant training time and space complexity by sub-sampling the training set to a fixed size. The characteristics of the most relevant anomaly detection algorithms is summarized in Table 1. All complexities are given with respect to the dataset size n in high-dimensional spaces.\nMost methods discussed do not scale to very large problems since either the training time is non-linear with the number of samples or the time to make a single prediction increases with the dataset size (stream length). We now present a novel anomaly detection algorithm to overcome these problems."

      "heading" : "4 Expected Similarity Estimation",
      "text" : "As before, let X be a random variable taking values in a measurable space (X, X ). We are primarily interested in the distribution of normal data PX|Y=cn for which we will simply use the shorthand notation P in the remainder of this work. Next we introduce some definitions which are necessary in the following.\nA Hilbert space (H, 〈·, ·〉) of functions f : X → R is said to be a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (rkhs) if the evaluation functional δ̄x : f 7→ f(x) is continuous. A function k : X×X→ R which satisfies the reproducing property\n〈f,k(x, ·)〉 = f(x) and in particular 〈k(x, ·),k(y, ·)〉 = k(x,y)\nis called reproducing kernel ofH (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008).2 The map φ : X→ H, φ : x 7→ k(x, ·) with the property that\nk(x,y) = 〈φ(x),φ(y)〉\nis called feature map.\nThroughout this work we assume that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (H, 〈·, ·〉) is separable such that φ is measurable. We therefore assume that the input space X is a separable topological space and the kernel k on X is continuous, which is sufficient for H to be separable (Steinwart and Christmann, 2008, Lemma 4.33).\nAs mentioned in the introduction, EXPoSE calculates a score which can be interpreted as the likelihood of an instance z ∈ X belonging to the distribution of normal data P. It uses a kernel function k to measure the similarity between instances of the input space X.\nDefinition 7 (Expected Similarity Estimation): The expected similarity of z ∈ X with respect to the (probability) distribution P is defined as\nη(z) = E [φ(z)] = ∫ X k(z, x)dP(x),\nwhere k : X×X→ R is a reproducing kernel. « Intuitively the query point z is compared to all other points of the distribution P. We will show that this equation can be rewritten as an inner product between the feature map φ(z) and the kernel mean map µ[P] of P. This reformulation is of central importance and will enable us to efficiently compute all quantities of interest. Given a reproducing kernel k, the kernel mean map can be used to embed a probability measure into a rkhs where it can be manipulated efficiently. It is defined as follows.\nDefinition 8 (Kernel Embedding): Let P be a Borel probability measure on X. The kernel embedding or kernel mean map µ[P] of P is defined as\nµ[P] = ∫ X k(x, ·)dP(x),\nwhere k is the associated continuous, bounded and positive-definite kernel function.«\nWe assume that the kernel k is bounded in expectation i. e.∫ X √ k(x, x)dP(x) <∞,\n2The notation k(x, ·) indicates that the second function argument is not bound to a variable.\nsuch that µ[P] exists for all Borel probability measures P (Sejdinovic et al, 2013, Page 8). This is a weaker assumption than k being bounded. We can now continue to formulate the central theorem of our work.\nTheorem 1: Let (H, 〈·, ·〉) be a rkhs with reproducing kernel k : X× X → R. The expected similarity of z ∈ X with respect to the distribution P can be expressed as\nη(z) = ∫ X k(z, x)dP(x)\n= 〈φ(z),µ[P]〉,\nwhere µ[P] is the kernel embedding of P. «\nThis reformulation has several desirable properties. At this point we see how the EXPoSE classifier can make prediction in constant time. After the kernel mean map µ[P] of P is learned, EXPoSE only needs to calculate a single inner product in H to make a prediction. However there are some crucial aspects to consider i. e. in Hilbert spaces, integrals and continuous linear forms are not in general interchangeable. In the proof of Theorem 1 we will thus use the weak integral and show that it coincides with the strong integral.\nDefinition 9 (Strong Integral): Let (X, X , P) be a σ-finite measure space and let φ : X→ H be measurable. Then φ is strong integrable (Bochner integrable) over a set D ∈X if and only if its norm ‖φ‖ is Lebesgue integrable over D, that is,∫\nD ‖φ‖dP(x) <∞. If φ is strong integrable over each D ∈X we say that φ is strong integrable. (Aliprantis and Border, 2006, Theorem 11.44) «\nDefinition 10 (Weak Integral): Let (X, X , P) be a σ-finite measure space. A function φ : X→ H is weakly integrable over a set D ∈X if there exists some λ ∈ H satisfying\n〈f, λ〉 = ∫ D 〈f,φ(x)〉dP(x)\nfor each f ∈ H. The weak integral is denoted by\nλ = ∮ D φdP(x)\nand the unique element λ ∈ H is called weak integral of φ over D. If the integral exists for each D ∈X we say that φ is weakly integrable. (Aliprantis and Border, 2006, Section 11.10) «\nA sufficient condition therefore is provided by the following lemma.\nLemma 1: If φ is strong (Bochner) integrable then φ is weak (Pettis) integrable and the two integrals coincide. (Aliprantis and Border, 2006, Theorem 11.50) «\nWe are now in the position to proof Theorem 1.\nProof of Theorem 1: By definition of the feature map φ we have∫ X k(x, z)dP(x) = ∫ X 〈φ(z),φ(x)〉dP(x)\nBy the assumption that k is bounded in expectation it follows that∫ X ‖φ(x)‖dP(x) = ∫ X √ k(x, x)dP(x) <∞\nand therefore φ is strongly integrable and hence weakly integrable (Lemma 1). By definition of the weak integral we get for all z ∈ X∫\nX\n〈φ(z),φ(x)〉dP(x) = 〈 φ(z), ∮ X φ(x)dP(x) 〉\n= 〈 φ(z), ∫ X φ(x)dP(x) 〉 = 〈φ(z),µ[P]〉\nfor all probability measures P.\nIn anomaly detection, we cannot assume to know the distribution of normal data P. However we assume to have access to n ∈ N independent realizations (x1, . . . , xn) sampled from P. It is common in statistics to estimate P with the empirical distribution\nPn = 1\nn n∑ i=1 δxi ,\nwhere δx is the Dirac measure. The empirical distribution Pn can also be used to construct an approximation µ[Pn] of µ[P] as\nµ[P] ≈ µ[Pn] = 1\nn n∑ i=1 φ(xi)\nwhich is called empirical kernel embedding (Smola et al, 2007). This is an efficient estimate since it can be shown (Schneider, 2016) that under the assumption ‖φ(X)‖ 6 c with c > 0 the difference between µ[P] and µ[Pn] is in probability\nP (∥∥µ[P] − µ[Pn]∥∥ > ) 6 2 exp(− n 2\n8c2 ) for all > 0.\nAs a consequence we can substitute µ[P] with µ[Pn] whenever the distribution P is not directly accessible yielding\nη(z) = 〈φ(z),µ[Pn]〉\n= 〈 φ(z), 1\nn n∑ i=1 φ(xi) 〉\nas the (empirical) EXPoSE anomaly detector. The empirical kernel embedding µ[Pn] is responsible for the linear training computational complexity of EXPoSE. We will call µ[Pn] the EXPoSE model. One of the important observations is, that EXPoSE makes no assumption about the type or shape of the data distribution P as such assumption can be wrong, causing erroneous predictions. This is an advantage over other statistical approaches that try to approximate the distribution directly with parametric models."

For t < l we set wt = 1 t ∑t i=1 and use the incremental update\nwt = 1\nl t∑ i=t−l+1 φ(xi)\n= wt−1 + 1\nl φ(xt) −\n1 l φ(xt−l),\nwhenever t > l.\nThe downside of a sliding window mechanism is the requirement to keep the past l ∈N events in memory. Also the sudden discard of a data point can lead to abrupt changes in predictions of the classifier which is sometimes not desirable. Another question is how to choose the correct window size. A shorter sliding window allows the algorithm to react faster to changes and requires less memory though the available data might not be representative or noise has too much negative impact. On the other hand a wider window may take too long to adapt to concept drift. The window size is therefore often dynamically adjusted (Widmer and Kubat, 1996) or multiple competing windows are used (Lazarescu et al, 2004)."

Typically a parameter can be used to control the tradeoff between fast adaptation to new observations and robustness against noise in the data. We can realize such a forgetting mechanism for EXPoSE by replacing the factor 1t in Proposition 1 by a constant γ ∈ [0, 1) yielding\nwt = { φ(xt) for t = 1 γφ(xt) + (1− γ)wt−1, for t > 1\nwhere, with γ = 0, no new observations are integrated into the model. This operation can be performed in constant time as summarized in the next proposition.\nProposition 3: Concept drift adaptation on data streams using a forgetting mechanism can be implemented for EXPoSE in O(1) time and memory. «\nProof: This is a direct consequence from Proposition 1.\nIn general, weighting with a fixed γ or using a static window size is called blind adaptation since the model does not utilize information about changes in the environment (Gama, 2010). The alternative is informed adaptation where one could, for example, use an external change detector (Gama et al, 2014) and weight new samples more if a concept drift was detected. We could also apply more sophisticated decay rules making γ a function of t or xt.\nA summary of characteristics for each proposed online learning variant of EXPoSE is listed in Table 2 and a general discussion can be found in literature, e.g. the work of Gama (2010)."

The random kitchen sinks (rks) approximation is based on Bochner’s theorem for translation invariant kernels (such as Laplace, Matérn, Gaussian rbf, etc.) and states that such a kernel can be represented as\nk(x,y) = ∫ z φ?z(x)φz(y)λ(z) with φz(x) = e i〈z,x〉,\nwhere φ? is the conjugate transpose of φ. A Monte Carlo approximation of this integral can then be used to estimate the expression above as\nk(x,y) ≈ 1 r r∑ i=1 φ?zi(x)φzi(y) = 〈φ̂(x), φ̂(y)〉 with zi ∼ λ.\nFor kernels such as the Gaussian rbf k(x,y) = exp(−12‖x− y‖ 2/σ2), the measure λ can be found with the help of the inverse Fourier transform yielding\nφ̂(x) = 1√ r exp(iZx) with Zij ∼ N(0,σ2) and Z ∈ Rr×d\nwhere d is the input space dimension. The parameter r ∈N determines the number of kernel expansions and is typically around 20,000.

This is a problem for online learning and streaming applications with concept drift. We therefore suggest to avoid the Nyström feature map in this context.\nRandom kitchen sinks and the Nyström approximation the most common feature map approximations.

We use several smaller benchmark datasets with known anomaly classes such as Ionosphere, Arrhythmia, Pima, Satellite, Shuttle, (Lichman, 2013), Biomed and Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Breastw) (Tax and Duin, 2004). These datasets are set up as described in (Liu et al, 2012) where all nominal and binary attributes are removed.\nThe larger datasets are the Kdd Cup 99 network intrusion data (KddCup) and Forest Cover Type (ForestCover). For KddCup instances we follow the setup of (Yu et al, 2003) and obtain a total of 127 attributes. Furthermore, we add two high-dimensional image datasets mnist and the Google Street View House Numbers (svhn) (Netzer et al, 2011). We use the scaled version of mnist (Chang and Lin, 2011) and create hog features (Vondrick et al, 2013) for svhn. The methodology suggested by (Schölkopf et al, 2001; Tax, 2001) is used to create anomaly detection datasets from mnist and svhn in the following way. We take all images of digit 1 from mnist as normal instances. The images of the remaining digits (2, 3, . . . , 9) are used as anomalies. We then create a dataset comprising all normal instances and a random subset anomalies such that anomalies account for 1% of the elements in the set. We repeat this process for mnist images of digits 2, 3, . . . , 9 and do the same with the 9 digit classes of svhn to create 18 anomaly detection datasets. The subset of anomalies is independently sampled for each repetition of an experiment. Table 3 provides an overview of the dataset properties and how the anomaly classes are defined.\nIn the experiment we provide a dedicated labeled random subset of 1% or 2000 instances (whichever is smaller) to configure the algorithms parameters. We emphasize that this subset is not used to evaluate the predictive performance. The parameter configuration is done by a pattern search (Torczon, 1997) using cross-validation. Examples of parameters being optimized are the number of nearest neighbors in lof and FastAbod, the kernel bandwidth of EXPoSE, kde and oc-svm or the number of trees for iForest. We do not optimize over different distance metrics and various kernels functions, but use the most common Euclidean distance and squared exponential\nkernel, respectively. However, we remark that the choice of these functions pose a possibility to include domain and expert knowledge into the system. Each experiment is repeated 5 times and their auc scores are used to perform the Friedman test. If not stated otherwise we use EXPoSE in combination with Nyström’s approximation for batch anomaly detection and random kitchen sinks in the streaming experiments as discussed in Section 6."

However the advantage of a tree data structure for nearest neighbor lookup in low dimensions can be seen when comparing the runtime of lof on ForestCover and mnist. Even though the ForestCover dataset has more than 2.5 times the size of mnist, it takes only a fraction of the time to be processed. This advantage vanishes in higher dimensions. kde and FastAbod exhibit a good anomaly detection performance on small datasets, however fail as soon as we apply them to medium-sized problems.\nWith the auc values we can perform the Friedman and post-hoc Nemenyi tests. The Friedman test confirms a statistical significant difference between the performances of the individual algorithms at a p-value of 0.05. From the critical difference diagram in Fig. 6 we observe that EXPoSE performs significant better than iForest, FastAbod and kde. While no significant difference in terms of anomaly detection between EXPoSE, oc-svm and lof can be confirmed, EXPoSE is several orders of magnitude faster on large-scale, high-dimensional datasets."

They can be combined with a concept drift detector to make the adaptation informed (Gama, 2010).\nThe evaluation of streaming algorithms is not as straightforward as the rating of batch learning techniques. There are two accepted techniques proposed in literature.\n• Using a dedicated subset of the data (holdout) and evaluate the algorithm at regular time intervals. The holdout set must reflect the respective stream properties and therefore has to evolve with the stream in case of a concept drift.\n• Making a prediction as the instance becomes available (prequential)3. A performance metric can then be applied based on the prediction and the actual label of the instance. Since predictions are made on the stream directly there are no special actions which have to be taken in case of concept drift.\nIf possible, the holdout method is preferable since it is an unbiased risk estimator and we can use a balanced test set with the same number of normal instances and anomalies. This is a disadvantage of the prequential method since, by definition, the data stream contains only a few anomalies. This is problematic since storm and cod assign hard class labels and, in contrast to auc, the classification accuracy is highly sensitive to unbalanced data. We will therefore use the balanced accuracy defined as\n0.5 · true positives true positives + false negatives + 0.5 · true negatives true negatives + false positives ,\nwhich compensates the unequal class distribution."

Every 25 time steps we calculate the accuracy using the holdout method for a dedicated random test set which contains 500 instances of the normal class and 500 instances of anomalies.\n3Prequential originates from predictive and sequential (Dawid, 1984).\nHere, the normal class is the digit which is streamed at time step t and anomalies are all other classes. Likewise we proceed with the Satellite and Shuttle datasets.\nSimilar, Ho (2005) proposed the three digit data stream (tdds) which contains four different concepts. Each concept consists of three digits of the usps handwritten digits dataset as described4. After all instances of concept 1 are processed, the stream switches to the second concept and so on until concept 4. We randomly induce 1% anomalies to each concept and use the prequential method for evaluation to calculate the balanced accuracy.\nAll datasets presented so far contain one or more sudden (abrupt) concept drifts. Bifet et al (2009) proposed a methodology to introduce a smooth (incremental) drift between two concepts. The instances of the concepts from two classes under consideration are sampled according to a Bernoulli distribution where the class probability smoothly changes from one class to the other according to a sigmoid function (Fig. 7). The concept drift occurs at t0 and w is the length of the drift interval. During this interval the instances of both concepts belong to the class of normal data. We apply this methodology to usps and create the smooth digit drift (sdd) dataset. We start with digit 1 and then smoothly change to digit 2 at t0 = 500 using w = 100. The next drift to digit 3 occurs at t0 = 1000 and we repeat this until digit 9. As before, we randomly add 1% anomalies to each concept and use the prequential method for evaluation.

The kernel embedding technique provides an efficient way to work with probability measures without the necessity to make assumptions about the underlying distributions.\nDespite its simplicity EXPoSE obeys a linear computational complexity for learning and can make predictions in constant time while it requires only constant memory. When applied incrementally or online, a model update can also be performed in constant time.

The method, named EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE), is kernel-based and able to efficiently compute the similarity between new data points and the distribution of regular data. The estimator is formulated as an inner product with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space embedding and makes no assumption about the type or shape of the underlying data distribution. We show that offline (batch) learning with EXPoSE can be done in linear time and online (incremental) learning takes constant time per instance and model update. Furthermore, EXPoSE can make predictions in constant time, while it requires only constant memory. In addition, we propose different methodologies for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. On several real datasets we demonstrate that our approach can compete with state of the art algorithms for anomaly detection while being an order of magnitude faster than most other approaches.",
