      "text" : "DOI:10.5121/ijcsit.2016.8107 85\nThere is a vast amount of unstructured Arabic information on the Web, this data is always organized in semi-structured text and cannot be used directly. This research proposes a semi-supervised technique that extracts binary relations between two Arabic named entities from the Web. Several works have been performed for relation extraction from Latin texts and as far as we know, there isn’t any work for Arabic text using a semi-supervised technique. The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of instance relations are required as input from the user. The system exploits summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations. The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club) relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.\nKEYWORDS\nRelation Extraction, Information Extraction, Pattern Extraction, Semi-Supervised, Arabic language & Web Mining."

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "There has been a growing interest in techniques for automatically extracting information from text. Specifically, Information Extraction (IE) [1, 2] is a process which takes texts as input and put them in a structured format, unambiguous data as output. The major research directions of IE are Named Entity Recognition (NER) such as (person, organization, location and so on) and Relations Extraction (RE) among them. Relation extraction has become in the last few years an interesting research domain. It is a very important for several applications, such as Web mining, Information retrieval, Questions answering, Social relationship network and Automatic summarization. RE is the task of recognizing the assertion of a particular relationship between two or more entities in text. Most relation extraction system focus on binary relation such as (is-a, part-of). The functional relation can be explicit or implicit. The explicit relation is indicated by a special word or sequence of words in the text, the implicit relation is a relation what can be mined from the text using the context [8].\nbased on bootstrapping. Semi-supervised learning has become an important topic in computational linguistics. For many languages processing tasks including relation extraction, there is an abundance of unlabeled data, where labeled data is lacking and too expensive to create in large quantities, therefore making bootstrapping techniques is desirable. The input is a small seed instance relations (e1, e2) and retrieved summaries from Google search engine as a source text. Each seed instance pair is used with the data source to generate patterns. Then, those patterns are used to extract new entity instances of the same relation as the seed instances. An instance with a high credibility score will be used as a seed instance in the next iteration, and then will be used to construct a structured relation set. This iterative process will be terminated if extracted instances reached to the number that determined by the user. For simplicity, only binary relations are taken into account in this paper and the target language is Arabic. The main features of this work are as follows:\n• The work is the first semi-supervised system that extracts binary relation instances from Arabic text using open source web contents.\n• The Google search engine summaries are used as a corpus resource. • The system is generic; it can be used in different domains based on the type of seed\ninstances.\n• The system detects Named Entities automatically through analysis of extracted patterns. Therefore, the system doesn¡¦t need specially prepared Named Entities dictionaries.\n• The syntactic analysis is made for Arabic text to increase the efficiency of the results.\nThe remaining of the paper is organized as follow: Section 2 introduces the previous works that were used to extract relations from text. Section 3 describes the challenges of the Arabic language. Section 4 describes components of the proposed system in details. Section 5 presents experiments and results. Section 6 contains conclusions."

      "heading" : "2. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "In this section, methods that extract semantic relations from texts will be reviewed. There are several works have been done for RE in English text, some of them were reviewed in [3], also there are some works for RE in Chinese [5, 6, 7], and other works in Portuguese were reviewed in [4] and as far as we know, very few works have been done for RE from Arabic text, it started from 2010 till now such as [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. These works were grouped according to the used technique into four categories [4, 8] rule-based, supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised methods.\nRule-based methods utilize predefined linguistic (syntactic and semantic) rules written manually to extract relationships based on part of speech information. It is very interesting for a restricted domain and has a good quality of analysis. The major drawback of this approach is the disability to perform well in dealing with a wide range or new domain data. This is due to two reasons: rules should be rewritten for different tasks or when the application is enlarged to different domains and finding rules manually is very hard and time-consuming [15]. Ben Hamadou et al., [8] extracted functional relations between Arabic person names and organizations for Arabicnamed entities using the NOOJ platform; they applied their experiment on a journalistic test corpus. Belkacem and Badr [9] presented some aspects to identify entities and relationships in Arabic text. They translated the Arabic sentences into a first order logic. Then, they used entities\ndeveloped a prototype for Arabic text spatial relations (topological relations, directional relations, and distance relations). It used a rule library which consists of a set of grammatical rules and lexico-syntactic patterns. These rules are applied to raw Arabic text to extract the spatial relations. The pattern-specific regular expressions were applied over the pre-processed sentences to verify that the pattern indeed occurs in the sentence.\nSupervised methods relation extraction depends on a classification task and use large corpus such as Ines Boujelben et al. [12] presented a tool called “RelANE” that detect all the semantic binary relations. For each word in the sentence, it uses its morphological, contextual and semantic features of entity types. Mohammed G.H. and Qasem [17] proposed a methodology that can extract ontological relationships. It can extract semantic features of Arabic text; propose syntactic patterns of relationships among concepts, and a formal model of extracting ontological relations. It has been designed to analyze Arabic text using lexical semantic patterns of the Arabic language according to a set of features.\nUnsupervised methods use clustering techniques and similarities between features or context words such as Hasegawa [18] assumed that pairs occurring in similar contexts share the same type of relation, they can be clustered together, then named entity recognition is applied to identify the entities of interest. Zhang M. et al., [19] proposed a tree-similarity-based unsupervised learning method to extract relations between named entities from a large raw corpus. They modified tree kernels on relation extraction to estimate the similarity between parse trees more efficiently. Then, the hierarchical clustering algorithm was used to group entity pairs into different clusters. Finally, each cluster is labeled by an indicative word and unreliable clusters are pruned out.\nSemi-supervised methods (weakly supervised) take a sample of patterns or some target relation instances for the purpose to acquire more basics until discovering all target relations such as Brin [20] proposed relation extraction system DIPRE, which starts with a small set of seed facts for one or more relations of interest. Then it looked for a pattern in sources as indicators of facts. Finally, it utilized these patterns to extract new facts. Agichtein and Gravano [21] proposed a system called Snowball, which adopted the similar strategy with DIPRE. However, Snowball didn’t use exact match, but a similarity function to group similar patterns instead. Snowball’s flexible matching system allows for slight variations in token or punctuation, it used NER to identify all organization and location entities. Ravichandran and Hovy [22] extracted simple surface patterns for extracting binary relations from The Web. It started with only a few examples of (question, answer) pairs. It focused on efficiency issues for scaling relation extraction to terabytes of data. It gave good results on specific relations such as birthdates, however, it had low precision on generic ones like (is-a) relation and (part-of) relation. Pennacchiotti and Panel [23] proposed a system called Espresso for extracting binary semantic relations. It started with a small set of seed instances for a particular relation, the system learned lexical patterns and then used the Web to filter and expand the instances. Rozenfeld and Feldman [24] implemented SRES (SelfSupervised Relation Extraction System). SRES took input names of the target relations and the types of their arguments. It then used a large set of unlabeled documents downloaded from the Web in order to learn the extraction patterns. SRES was related to the KnowItAll system which was developed by Oren Etzioni et al. [25]. Chao Chen et al. [5] developed REV (Relation Extraction with Verification). It extracted relations in Chinese text from World Wide Web, it just required a seed instances with the form of (e1, e2, keyword) as input and World Wide Web was used as data source. Yang et al. [6] proposed a tuple refinement method based on relationship\nentity relation keyword, and then crawl the co-occurrence of entity and relation keywords by the redundant web information; it saved the highest statistical value of candidate entities as the second entity based on the principle of proximity and the predefined entity type. David S. et al. [16] proposed a bootstrapping system for relation extraction based on word embedding. It achieved better results when used related words to find similar relationships than with similarities between weighted vectors. It extracted four types of relationships from a collection of newswire documents."

      "heading" : "3. THE CHALLENGES OF ARABIC LANGUAGE",
      "text" : "In fact, the extracting relation from Arabic text is not an easy task due to challenges related to the Arabic language. Arabic language [14] is a language which different from Indo-European languages syntactically, semantically and morphologically.\nThe research progress of Arabic relation extraction is relatively limited. This limitation might be due to the nature of the Arabic language beside the lack of available linguistic resources. Actually, the accessible corpora are not annotated with named entities, and the relations do not include a sufficient number of annotated examples can be exploited for learning approaches. Arabic is a Semitic language that presents interesting morphological and orthographic challenges that could complicate the extraction of relations between NEs. In addition to the problems that are related to Arabic NE recognition and relation extraction task poses some specific challenges listed in [8, 12] some of these challenges are:\n1) Multiple relations may be occurred between the same NEs. 2) Implicit Relations: that is not directly recognized by words in the text. They are mined from the text using contextual elements, for example relation is Belong-to. 3) It is necessary to use the previous context of the relation to know the missing element involved in the relation. 4) Interference between implicit relation and discontinuity. 5) The omission of one element of the relation between named entities NE (NE1, R, ?) or (?, R, NE2) or (NE1, ?, NE2). These challenges which are listed above should be considered to achieve an efficient system for extracting relations."

      "heading" : "4. THE PROPOSED SYSTEM",
      "text" : "In this section, the proposed semi-supervised system for Arabic relations extraction will be illustrated. The purpose of the proposed system is to extract instances of binary semantic relations that lie in the same line of the Arabic text. The system extracts relation between two named entities (e1, e2); e1 should be a person named entity and e2 any other named entity. The input to the proposed system is a small seed instance of the target relation and Google search result summaries as the source text. The output is a list of instances relations, i/e., named entities and the relation between them. The algorithm of the proposed system is shown in Figure 1.\nThe proposed system is an iterative process; each iteration consists of two phases 1) Pattern Extraction, 2) Instances Extraction. Each phase will be introduced in details in the following subsections."

In our proposed system, named entity can be person name, book title, organization name, etc. These initial instances pairs which stored in input table are used to start patterns extraction in the first iteration. The initial instances are given by the user and it can vary\ncase of using a list of four initial seed is better than one or two or three seed to discover the many different patterns. Figure 3 shows that the greater the number of seed instances greater the number of extracted pattern, since the candidate patterns refer to all patterns with repetition and pattern extraction refer to the patterns without repetition. For example, using one seed instances it will give 13 candidate pattern 5 of them non-repeated patterns and then lifted slightly with 2, 3 seeds. But when using four seeds, extracted patterns will a significant increase increasingly so it was decided to use four seed instances as input."

It was found that results above the 20 summaries contain unrelated or repeated results. Therefore, increasing the number collected above 20 summaries, does not affect the number of extracted patterns. So, choosing 20 top summaries for each pair is suitable.

We presented\nto them printed form that contains output extracted instances to judge and evaluate the correctness\nof new instances after terminating iterations. They evaluated manually using the internet. For\neach instance pair, we asked human judges to assign a score of 1 for correct, 0 for incorrect. After\nthat, we computed numbers of instances (correct - incorrect) for each pattern to evaluate pattern\nin the next step. As different relation extract a different number of instances, in order to assess the\nexperiment result, we use three common evaluation measures: Precision P, Recall R and F-\nMeasure for all extracted instances of each relation. We measure the correctness of extracted\ninstances according to existing correct ones using a recall metric, measuring the ability of our\nproposed methodology to extract instances with respect to all information using a precision\nmetric, and finally, applied an F-measure that denotes the overall accuracy.\nGiven numbers of correctly classified extracted instances, denoted as Nc and actual number of correct instances concepts, denoted as A = Nc + Uc. Where Uc represents undetected instances, Uc were discovered manually by human judge for all text file and T represents the total number of extracted instances.\nThese metrics are defined as follows:\nPatterns can be evaluated by calculating confidence for each pattern with its extracted instances\nwhich were extracted from it. Patterns may be too general, thus they generate invalid instances.\nThe probability of pattern in generating valid instances is calculated by the confidence of the\nextracted patterns for relations as Agichtein and Gravano [21]. The confidence of a pattern P is:-\nWhere positive is the number of correct instances for P and negative is the number of incorrect instances. Table 2 shows that samples of confidence for some patterns.\nFor example, if this pattern P matches three Arabic sentences as shown:\nThe sentence S1 generates instance pair ( 01ا اظ ' , ( ,+ #با 3ر) and sentence S2 generates ( حو ا ةد ,7 8 ا 9 + ) which are correct instances, so the first 2 sentences are considered as positive instances. The third sentence S3 generates instance ( #: ;. ا # ب , <=> ا ) which are incorrect\ninstances, so it is considered as a negative instance. Conf P =\n= 0.66. This result is\nsatisfactory, where Conf P > 0.5 and then extracted pattern is mostly reliable. To measure the reliability for patterns;\n1. Calculate confidence for each pattern, if Conf P ≥ 0.5 it is a reliable pattern. 2. Calculate the number of instances that each pattern can extract or detect. 3. Check for new pattern if already exists in previous iterations. Then, this pattern is more reliable."

After evaluating all these instances, we found that 29 incorrect instances and 25 instances were undetected by our system.\nAfter applying our proposed system on four different relations types, we observed that the results of some patterns when searched in Google it gives English text results (summaries), we found that, the patterns which contain keywords about relation on prefix or middle give correct instances than the patterns that do not contain any keywords in prefix or middle. We found also that those patterns which are more general extracted incorrect instances and those patterns which are more specific extracted a small number of instances.\nThe results for all experiments are summarized in tables (3 and 4). It can be observed that three types of relations reached a threshold value of extracted instances after the second iteration and one relation “president-of” needed to the third iteration to reach this value as shown in table 3 Where “T” represents total number of extracted instances, “N” the number of newly extracted instances and R represents repeated instances in last iterations. R in the first iteration represents a number of instances repeated from input seed instances.\nof patterns that could extract instances. It was observed that Pdetect does not exceed one-third to half from the Ptotal.\nBy evaluating all extracted instances for each relation type after terminating the iterations we found that; the performance of proposed system nearly different from relation type to another as shown in table 5 where “NC” represents correct instances, “I” represents incorrect instances and “UC” represents undetected instances.\nAfter evaluating each extracted patterns by measuring confidences, the average confidence for different iterations was calculated for four relations types as shown in Table 6. The average confidence ranges from 0.6 to 0.8. This means that extracted patterns are accurate.\nand f-measure is shown in Table 7. It can be observed that the best results have been achieved for\n(player, club) relation, whereas results for (president, country) relation are the lowest ones. The\noverall performance for the system is satisfactory."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS",
      "text" : "In this paper, we introduced a semi-supervised system to extract binary semantic relations for Arabic text from the Web. It only needed a few seed instances as input. Google search engine was used as a source of text. Our system depended on the pattern-based system. The system extracted patterns then searched with these patterns in Google search engine to extract new instances. These new instances were filtered to avoid a noise. Only new unrepeated instances are used as input instances for the next iteration. This iterative process was terminated after a total number of extracted instances reached a threshold value that determined by the user. We performed four experiments for four relations to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. Four common relations were the author-of (person, book) relation, president-of (person, country) relation, playin (person, club) relation and CEO-of or chairman (person, company) relation. Our system was evaluated by four human judges to measure the correctness for extracted instances. The quality of patterns was evaluated after terminating the system by calculating confidence for each pattern with its extracted instances. After that, we measured the performance of the system by calculating Precision, Recall, and F-Measure for extracted instances for each relation type, the result was different from domain to domain. The system can be applied on other domains such as movies (director’s name, film’s name), music (singer, song), political (head’s name, political party) and so on.\nOur future work will focus on the improvement of rules of filtering to obtain corrected instances. And this work will be applied on another dataset to compare its results with results of Google search. Finally, we would like to extract complex relation."

    "abstractText" : "There is a vast amount of unstructured Arabic information on the Web, this data is always organized in semi-structured text and cannot be used directly. This research proposes a semi-supervised technique that extracts binary relations between two Arabic named entities from the Web. Several works have been performed for relation extraction from Latin texts and as far as we know, there isn’t any work for Arabic text using a semi-supervised technique. The goal of this research is to extract a large list or table from named entities and relations in a specific domain. A small set of a handful of instance relations are required as input from the user. The system exploits summaries from Google search engine as a source text. These instances are used to extract patterns. The output is a set of new entities and their relations. The results from four experiments show that precision and recall varies according to relation type. Precision ranges from 0.61 to 0.75 while recall ranges from 0.71 to 0.83. The best result is obtained for (player, club) relationship, 0.72 and 0.83 for precision and recall respectively.",
