{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Near-Data Processing for Machine Learning", "abstract": "In computer architecture, near-data processing (NDP) refers to augmenting the memory or the storage with processing power so that it can process the data stored therein. By offloading the computational burden of CPU and saving the need for transferring raw data in its entirety, NDP exhibits a great potential for acceleration and power reduction. Despite this potential, specific research activities on NDP have witnessed only limited success until recently, often owing to performance mismatches between logic and memory process technologies that put a limit on the processing capability of memory. Recently, there have been two major changes in the game, igniting the resurgence of NDP with renewed interest. The first is the success of machine learning (ML), which often demands a great deal of computation for training, requiring frequent transfers of big data. The second is the advent of NAND flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) containing multicore processors that can accommodate extra computation for data processing. Sparked by these application needs and technological support, we evaluate the potential of NDP for ML using a new SSD platform that allows us to simulate in-storage processing (ISP) of ML workloads. Our platform (named ISP-ML) is a full-fledged simulator of a realistic multi-channel SSD that can execute various ML algorithms using the data stored in the SSD. For thorough performance analysis and in-depth comparison with alternatives, we focus on a specific algorithm: stochastic gradient decent (SGD), which is the de facto standard for training differentiable learning machines including deep neural networks. We implement and compare three variants of SGD (synchronous, Downpour, and elastic averaging) using ISP-ML, exploiting the multiple NAND channels for parallelizing SGD. In addition, we compare the performance of ISP and that of conventional in-host processing, revealing the advantages of ISP. Based on the advantages and limitations identified through our experiments, we further discuss directions for future research on ISP for accelerating ML.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "Combining storage and processing capabilities is an interesting research topic because data transfer is a major issue for many machine learning tasks.\nThe paper itself is well-written, but unfortunately addresses a lot of things only to medium depth (probably due length constraints).\nMy opinion is that a journal with an in-depth discussion of the technical details would be a better target for this paper.\n\nEven though the researchers took an interesting approach to evaluate the performance of the system, it's difficult for me to grasp the expected practical improvements of this approach.\nWith such a big focus on GPU (and more specialized hardware such as TPUs), the one question that comes to mind: By how much does this - or do you expect it to - beat the latest and greatest GPU on a real task?\n\nI don't consider myself an expert on this topic even though I have some experience with SystemC.", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "This paper is well motivated and clearly written, and is representative of the rapidly growing interdisciplinary area of hardware-software co-design for handling large-scale Machine Learning workloads. In particular, the paper develops a detailed simulator of SSDs with onboard multicore processors so that ML computations can be done near where the data resides.\n \n Reviewers are however unanimously unconvinced about the potential impact of the simulator, and more broadly the relevance to ICLR. The empirical section of the paper is largely focused on benchmarking logistic regression models on MNIST, which reviewers find underwhelming. It is conceivable that the results reflect performance on real hardware, but the ICLR community would atleast expect to see realistic deep learning workloads on larger datasets such as Imagenet, where scalability challenges have been throughly studied. Without such results, the impact of the contribution is hard to evaluate and the claimed gains are bit of a leap of faith. \n \n The authors make several good points in their response about the paper - that their method is expected to scale, that high quality simulations can given insights that can inform hardware manufacturing, and that their approach complements other hardware and algorithmic acceleration strategies. They are encouraged to resubmit the paper with a stronger empirical section, e.g., benchmarking training and inference of Inception-like models on ImageNet.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Good approach for linear ML, too early for DNNs", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "For more than a decade, near data processing has been a key requirement for large scale linear learning platforms, as the time to load the data exceeds the learning time, and this has justified the introduction of approaches such as Spark\n\nDeep learning usually deals with the data that can be contained in a single machine and the bottleneck is often the CPU-GPU bus or the GPU-GPU-bus, so a method that overcomes this bottleneck could be relevant.\n\nUnfortunately, this work is still very preliminary and limited to linear training algorithms, so of little interest yet to ICLR readership. I would recommend publication to a conference where it can reach the large-scale linear ML audience first, such as ICML.

Obviously, when the authors have convincing DNN learning simulations, they are welcome to target ICLR, but can the flash memory FPGA handle it?\n\nFor experiments, the choice of MNIST is somewhat bizarre: this task is small and performance is notoriously terrible when using linear approaches (the authors do not even report it)", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Interesting topic, hard to fully understand the impact", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Combining storage and processing capabilities is an interesting research topic because data transfer is a major issue for many machine learning tasks.\nThe paper itself is well-written, but unfortunately addresses a lot of things only to medium depth (probably due length constraints).\nMy opinion is that a journal with an in-depth discussion of the technical details would be a better target for this paper.\n\nEven though the researchers took an interesting approach to evaluate the performance of the system, it's difficult for me to grasp the expected practical improvements of this approach.\nWith such a big focus on GPU (and more specialized hardware such as TPUs), the one question that comes to mind: By how much does this - or do you expect it to - beat the latest and greatest GPU on a real task?\n\nI don't consider myself an expert on this topic even though I have some experience with SystemC.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 2}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Near-Data Processing for Machine Learning", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "While the idea of moving the processing for machine learning into silicon contained within the (SSD) data storage devices is intriguing and offers the potential for low-power efficient computation, it is a rather specialized topic, so I don't feel it will be of especially wide interest to the ICLR audience.
