      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Many computational problems that arise in the world are NP-hard, and thus likely to be intractable from a worst-case point of view. However, the particular instances of these problems that are actually encountered can often be solved effectively using heuristics that do not have good worst-case guarantees. Typically there are a number of heuristics available for solving any particular NP-hard problem, and there is no one heuristic that performs best on all problem instances. Thus, when solving a particular instance of an NP-hard problem, it is not clear a priori how to best make use of the available CPU time.\nSpecifically, suppose you wish to solve an instance x of a computational problem, and there are k heuristics available for solving it. Each heuristic, when run on instance x, will either solve the instance in finite time (e.g., by returning a provably correct “yes” or “no” answer to a decision problem, returning a provably optimal solution to an optimization problem), or will run forever without solving it. When solving x, you will in general have some prior knowledge of how each\nof the k heuristics behaves on other instances of the same computational problem. Naturally, you would like to solve x as quickly as possible.\nIn this situation, a natural approach would be to label each previously-encountered problem instance with a set of features, and then to use some machine learning algorithm to predict which of the k heuristics will return an answer in the shortest amount of time. However, if we then run the predicted fastest heuristic and it does not yield an answer after some sufficiently large amount of time, we might suspect that the machine learning algorithm’s prediction was a mistake, and might try running a different heuristic instead. Alternatively, if the heuristic is randomized, we might try restarting it and running with a fresh random seed.\nWe refer to the general problem of determining how to solve a problem instance in this setting as algorithm portfolio design [5, 6]. As just illustrated, the problem has both a machine learning aspect (predicting which heuristic will solve the instance first) and a scheduling aspect (determining how long to run a heuristic before giving up and trying a different heuristic). Previous work (e.g., [6, 8, 10]) has largely addressed one of the two aspects in isolation (we discuss previous work in detail in §6). In this work, we present an approach that addresses both aspects of the problem simultaneously and has attractive theoretical guarantees.\nWe note up front that our work does not address all possible aspects of the algorithm portfolio design problem. For example, we ignore the possibility of making scheduling decisions dynamically based on the observed behavior of the heuristics (e.g., if a heuristic has a progress bar that indicates how close it is to solving the instance). We also ignore the possibility of sharing information (e.g., upper and lower bounds on the optimal value of the objective function) between heuristics as they are executing."

      "heading" : "1.1 Formal setup",
      "text" : "We are given as input a set H of heuristics (i.e., algorithms with potentially large running time) for solving some computational problem. Heuristic h, when run on problem instance x, runs for T (h, x) time units before solving the problem. If h is randomized, then T (h, x) is a random variable whose outcome depends on the sequence of random bits supplied as input to h.\nWe will be interested in interleaving the execution of heuristics according to schedules of the following form.\nDefinition (schedule). A schedule S = 〈(h1, τ1), (h2, τ2), . . .〉 is a sequence of pairs (h, τ) ∈ H × R>0, where each pair (h, τ) represents running heuristic h for time t.\nWhen interpreting a schedule, we allow each heuristic h ∈ H to be executed in one of two models (the choice of model need not be the same for all heuristics). If h is executed in the suspend-and-resume model, then a pair (h, τ) represents continuing a run of heuristic h for an additional τ time units. The run of h is then temporarily suspended and kept resident in memory, to be potentially resumed later on. In contrast, if h is executed in the restart model, then a pair (h, τ) represents running h from scratch for time τ , and then deleting the run from memory (if h is randomized, the run is performed with a fresh random seed).\nAbusing notation slightly, we use T (S, x) to denote the time required to solve problem instance x using schedule S. We illustrate the definition of T (S, x) with an example. Consider the schedule\nS = 〈(h1, 2), (h2, 2), (h1, 4), . . .〉\nillustrated in Figure 1. Suppose H = {h1, h2}, both heuristics are deterministic, and T (h1, x) = T (h2, x) = 3. Then T (S, x) = 5 if h1 is executed in the suspend-and-resume model, whereas T (S, x) = 7 if h1 is executed in the restart model. Note that in calculating T (S, x) when S is executed in the suspendand-resume model, we ignore any overhead associated with context-switching.\nThis class of schedules is quite flexible, and includes restart-schedules [11] and task-switching schedules [13] as special cases. A restart schedule is a schedule for a single randomized heuristic, executed in the restart model. A task-switching schedule is a schedule for a set of one or more deterministic heuristics, each executed in the suspend-and-resume model.\nAn algorithm portfolio is a way to decide what schedule to use to solve a particular problem instance.\nDefinition (algorithm portfolio). An algorithm portfolio is a procedure φ that, given a problem instance x, returns a schedule φ(x) to use to solve x.\nWe measure the performance of a schedule S on a problem instance x in terms of E [T (S, x)], where the expectation is over the random bits used in the runs that S performs. We are interested in optimizing this objective in two settings: offline and online.\nIn the offline setting, we are given as input a set of training instances, along with the value of T (x, h) (or in general, an estimate of its distribution) for each heuristic h and training instance x. Our goal is to construct an algorithm portfolio (within some class) that performs optimally on the set of training instances. We would then use such a portfolio to solve additional, similar problem instances more efficiently.\nIn the online setting, we are fed a sequence X = 〈x1, x2, . . . , xn〉 of problem instances one at a time and must obtain a solution to each instance (via some schedule) before moving on to the next instance. When selecting a schedule Si to use to solve instance xi, we have knowledge of the previous instances x1, x2, . . . , xi−1 but we have no knowledge of xi itself or of any subsequent instances. In this setting, our goal is to learn an effective algorithm portfolio on-the-fly, again with the aim of minimizing average CPU time."

For the offline setting, the main result is a greedy algorithm that returns a 4-approximation to the optimal schedule; achieving a 4− approximation for any > 0 is NP-hard. For the online setting, the main result is an online schedule-selection algorithm whose worst-case performance guarantees converge to those of the offline greedy approximation algorithm, asymptotically as the number of instances grows large. Note that the latter guarantee does not require any statistical assumptions about the sequence of problem instances.\nIn §3, we discuss how the online algorithm discussed in §2 can be combined with algorithms for solving the\nso-called sleeping experts problem in order to take advantage of Boolean features of an instance when selecting a schedule. This approach yields an online algorithm that, simultaneously for each feature f , is guaranteed to perform near-optimally (i.e., average CPU time asymptotically at most 4 times that of any schedule) on the subset of instances for which f is true.\nIn §4, we evaluate these techniques experimentally, and show that they can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics for Boolean satisfiability, A.I. planning, and zero-one integer programming.\nThe results just described apply only to the objective of minimizing average CPU time. In §5, we consider the case in which each heuristic is an anytime algorithm that returns solutions of increasing quality over time. We describe how our results for minimizing average CPU time can be generalized to yield schedules with good anytime behavior, and demonstrate the power of this approach by applying it to state-of-theart heuristics for zero-one integer programming."

We assume that for each heuristic h ∈ H and training instance x ∈ X , the distribution of T (h, x) is known exactly (in practice, we would have to estimate it by performing a finite number of runs).\nBuilding on previous work on the Min-Sum Set Cover problem [3], Streeter et al. [16, 17] developed a greedy approximation algorithm for this offline problem. Let f(S) denote the sum, over all instances x ∈ X , of the probability that executing schedule S yields a solution to instance x. The schedule G = 〈g1, g2, . . .〉 returned by the greedy approximation algorithm can be defined inductively as follows: G1 = 〈〉, Gj = 〈g1, g2, . . . , gj−1〉 for j > 1, and\ngj = arg max a=(h,τ)∈H×R>0\n{ f(Gj + a)− f(Gj)\nτ\n} (1)\nwhere Gj+a denotes the schedule obtained by appending the pair a to Gj .1 Informally, G is constructed by\n1 Evaluating the arg max in (1) requires considering\ngreedily appending a run a = (h, τ) to the schedule so as to maximize the expected number of instances a solves per unit time.\nThe performance of G is summarized by the following theorem.

G is a 4-approximation to the optimal schedule. That is,\n∑ x∈X E [T (G, x)] ≤ 4 ·min S {∑ x∈X E [T (S, x)] } .\nFurthermore, for any > 0, obtaining a 4− approximation to the optimal schedule is NP-hard (even in the special case where all heuristics are deterministic)."

When selecting Si, one has no knowledge of xi itself. After solving xi, one learns only the outcomes of the runs that were actually performed when executing Si. As in the offline setting, the goal is to minimize the average CPU time required to solve each instance in the sequence.\nRecently, Streeter and Golovin [15] developed an online algorithm for an abstract scheduling problem that includes this online problem as a special case. For the results of [15] to apply, we must make some additional assumptions. First, we assume that T (h, xi) is an integer for all heuristics h and instances xi. Second, we assume that the CPU time the online algorithm uses up on any particular instance xi is artificially capped at some value B (without such a cap, the online algorithm could be forced to spend an arbitrarily large amount of CPU time solving a single instance, and we could prove no meaningful bounds on its performance).\nThe algorithm presented in [15] is called OG, for “online greedy”, and can be viewed as an online version of the greedy approximation algorithm described in §2.1. The following theorem shows that its worstcase performance guarantees approach those of the offline greedy algorithm, asymptotically as the number of problem instances approaches infinity. The theorem can be proved as a corollary of [15, Theorem 11] (for a formal derivation, see [14, Chapter 3])."

      "heading" : "3 Exploiting Features",
      "text" : "The algorithms referred to in theorems 1 and 2 provide no mechanism for tailoring the choice of schedule to the particular problem instance being solved. In practice, there may be quickly-computable features that distinguish one instance from another and suggest the use of different heuristics. In this section, we describe how existing techniques for solving the socalled sleeping experts problem can be used to exploit such features in an attractive way.\nThe sleeping experts problem is defined as follows. One has access to a set of M experts. On each day, a given expert is either awake, in which case the expert dispenses a piece of advice, or the expert is asleep. At the beginning of day i, one must select an awake expert whose advice to follow. Following the advice of expert j on day i incurs a loss `ij ∈ [0, 1]. At the end of day i, the value of the loss `ij for each (awake) expert j is made public, and can be used as the basis for making choices on subsequent days. Note that the historical performance of an expert does not imply any guarantees about its future performance. Remarkably, randomized expert-selection algorithms nevertheless exist that achieve the following guarantee: simultaneously for each j, one’s expected loss on the subset Dj of days when j was awake is at most∑ i∈Dj ` i j + O (√ n logM + logM ) . Thus, when using such an algorithm2, one asymptotically performs as well as any fixed expert on the subset of days that expert was awake.\nSuppose that each problem instance xi is labeled with the values of M Boolean features. We will exploit such features by applying the sleeping experts algorithm in a standard way. We create, for each feature j, a copy Aj of the online schedule-selection algorithm OG that is only run on instances where feature j is true. We then use an algorithm for the sleeping experts problem to select among the schedules returned by the various copies, as described in the pseudo-code for OGse. Due to space constraints, the pseudo-code refers to [15, 17]\n2See [2] for a description of such an algorithm. The algorithm maintains, for each expert, a weight that is adjusted based on its performance relative to other experts. On each day, experts are selected with probability proportional to their weights.\nfor the details of certain steps. As in §2.2, we use B to denote an artificial bound on CPU time.\nAlgorithm OGse\nInitialization: let E be a copy of the sleeping experts algorithm of [2]; and for each feature j, let Aj be a copy of OG [15].\nFor i from 1 to n: 1. Let Fi be the set of features that are true\nfor xi. For each feature j ∈ Fi, use Aj to select a schedule Si,j .\n2. Use E to select a feature (expert) ji ∈ Fi, and select the schedule Si = Si,ji .\n3. With probability γ = Θ ( n− 1 4 ) , explore\nas follows. Using the procedure of [17], run each heuristic for time O (B logB) in order to obtain a function f̂ such that for any schedule S, E [ f̂(S) ] =\nE [min {B, T (S, xi)}]. Feed f̂ back to each Aj , as described in [15]. Finally, for each j, set `ij = 1 B f̂(Si,j). Otherwise (with probability 1− γ) set `ij = 0 for all j.\n4. For each j ∈ Fi, feed back `ij to E as the loss for expert j.\nThe performance of OGse is summarized by the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. Let Xj be the subset of instances for which feature j is true. Let T (x) be the CPU time spent by OGse on instance x. Then, simultaneously for each j, we have\nE ∑ x∈Xj T (x)  ≤ 4·min S ∑ x∈Xj E [T (S, x)] +O (n 34) . Proof. As already discussed, the algorithm E used as a subroutine in OGse guarantees that, for any j,∑\nx∈Xj `iji ≤ ∑ x∈Xj `ij +R (2)\nwhere R = O (√ n logM + logM ) . Define Li(S) =\nE [min {B, T (S, xi)}]. Thus E [ `ij ]\n= γBLi(Si,j). Taking the expectation of both sides of (2) yields\n∑ x∈Xj Li(Si) ≤ ∑ x∈Xj Li(Si,j) + B γ R .\nNote that Bγ R = O ( n 3 4 ) (for constant M). At the same time, by Theorem 2 we have ∑ x∈Xj Li(Si,j) ≤ 4 ·min S ∑ x∈Xj E [T (S, x)]\n+O (n 34) . Finally, because γ = Θ ( n− 1 4 ) , we have\nE [∑ x∈Xj T (x) ] ≤ ∑ x∈Xj Li(Si) + O ( n 3 4 ) . Putting these equations together proves the theorem.\nNote that Theorem 3 provides a very strong guarantee. For example, if each instance is labeled as either “large” or “small” and also as either “random” or “structured”, then the performance of OGse on large instances will be nearly as good as that of the optimal schedule for large instances, and simultaneously its performance on structured instances will be nearly as good as that of the optimal schedule for structured instances (even though these subsets of instances overlap, and the optimal schedule for each subset may be quite different)."

      "text" : "Each year, various computer science conferences hold competitions designed to assess the state of the art solvers in some problem domain. In these competitions, each submitted solver is run on a sequence of problem instances, subject to some per-instance time limit. Solvers are awarded points based on the instances they solve and how fast they solve them, and prizes are awarded to the highest-scoring solvers.\nThe experiments reported here make use of data from the following three solver competitions.\n1. SAT 2007. Boolean satisfiability is the task of determining whether there exists an assignment of truth values to a set of Boolean variables that satisfies each clause (disjunction) in set of clauses. SAT solvers are used as subroutines in state-ofthe-art algorithms for hardware and software verification and A.I. planning. The SAT 2007 competition included industrial, random, and handcrafted benchmarks.\n2. IPC-5. A.I. planning is the problem of finding a sequence of actions (called a plan) that leads from\na starting state to a desired goal state, according to some formal model of how actions affect the state of the world. We used data from the optimal planning track of the Fifth International Planning Competition (IPC-5), in which the model of the world is specified in the STRIPS language and the goal is to find a plan with (provably) minimum length.\n3. PB’07. Pseudo-Boolean optimization is the task of minimizing a function of zero-one variables subject to algebraic constraints, also known as zeroone integer programming. On many benchmarks, pseudo-Boolean optimizers (which are usually based on SAT solvers) outperform general integer programming packages such as CPLEX [1]. The PB’07 evaluation included both optimization and decision (feasibility) problems from a large number of domains, including formal verification and logic synthesis.\nOur experiments for each solver competition followed a common procedure. First, we determined the value of T (h, x) for each heuristic h and benchmark instance x using data available on the competition web site (we did not actually run any of the heuristics). The heuristics considered in these competitions are deterministic (or randomized, but run with a fixed random seed), so T (h, x) is simply a single numeric value. If a heuristic did not finish within the competition time limit, then T (h, x) is undefined. Second, we discarded any instances that none of the heuristics could solve within the time limit.\nGiven a schedule S and instance x, we will not generally be able to determine the true value of T (S, x), due to the fact that T (h, x) is undefined for some heuristics. We can, however, determine the value of min {B, T (S, x)}, where B is the competition time limit. We use this lower bound in all the comparisons that follow."

The figure shows average CPU time (on test instances) as a function of the number of training instances, for both versions of the greedy algorithm (suspend-and-resume and restart). For comparison, the figure also shows the average CPU time required by the fastest individual solver, as well as a schedule that simply ran all solvers in parallel (i.e., if there are k solvers, each one receives a 1k fraction of the CPU time).\nFigure 2 has several noteworthy features. First, only a small number of training instances (in this case 16) are required in order to produce a schedule that outperforms both the fastest individual solver and the näıve parallel schedule. Second, with a sufficient number of training instances, the gap between the performance of the greedy schedules and that of the fastest individual solver is significant (in this case, more than a factor of 2). Third, the suspend-and-resume model offers only a relatively small advantage over the restart model. We have observed these same three trends in a number of other cases (e.g., see Figure 3).\nWe note that previous work (e.g., [16]) gave learningtheoretic bounds on the number of training instances required to learn a near-optimal schedule; however, these worst-case upper bounds are quite pessimistic relative to our experimental results."

We present results for two instance sets: the random category of the SAT 2007 competition, and the optimal planning track of IPC-5. For the SAT instances, we labeled each instance with Boolean features based on the size of the formula, the ratio of clauses to variables, and the number of literals per clause. For the planning instances, we used features based on the planning domain, the number of goals, the number of objects, and the number of predicates in the initial conditions.\nTo evaluate the effect of features, we used a procedure similar to the one used in the experiments summarized in Figure 2. Given a data set, we sample m training instances at random, and examine how average performance (on test instances) varies as a function of m. For each value of m, we again repeated the experiment 100 times and averaged the results. In addition to evaluating the greedy algorithm from §2.1, we now evaluate two other approaches. The first approach, which we refer to as “Greedy w/features”, uses the algorithm OGse from §3 to select (suspend-and-resume) schedules as follows. First, we run OGse on each of the m training instances, with exploration probability γ = 1. We then run the algorithm on each of the n−m test instances, with exploration probability γ = 0 (so the algorithm receives no feedback on test instances). The second approach, which we refer to as “Features only” below, is similar except that it uses the sleeping experts algorithm of [2] to select a single heuristic (rather than a schedule), and runs that heuristic until it obtains a solution. Here we focus on performance as a function of the number of training instances, because the number of benchmark instances was typically too small to allow for good performance in the online setting of §2.2.\nFigures 3 (A) and (B) present our results for the SAT and planning instances, respectively. Both graphs exhibit two noteworthy features. First, when the number of training instances is relatively small, a pure scheduling approach outperforms a purely feature-based approach; but as the number of training instances increases, the reverse is true. This behavior makes intuitive sense: when the number of training instances is small, committing to a single heuristic based on the training data is a very risky thing to do, and thus a purely feature-based approach can perform very poorly (e.g., worse than the näıve parallel schedule); as the number of training instances increases this becomes less of a risk. Second, in all cases, an approach that uses features to select schedules outperforms either a pure scheduling or purely feature-based approach.\nFigure 4 depicts the (suspend-and-resume) schedule returned by the greedy algorithm when all available\n(A) SAT'07, random\nSAT instances are used as training data. As indicated in the figure, the greedy schedule makes use a variety of different SAT solvers, and spends a significant amount of time running solvers whose overall average CPU time did not put them at the top of the competition."

      "text" : "Thus far, we have thought of a heuristic as a program that, given a problem instance, runs for some fixed amount of time before definitively solving it (e.g., by returning a provably optimal solution). Now suppose instead that our heuristics are anytime algorithms that return solutions of increasing quality over time. In this case, we would like to construct a schedule that yields near-optimal solutions quickly, in addition to yielding provably optimal solutions quickly.\nOne simple way to do this is as follows. Define, for each instance, a set of objectives to achieve (e.g., finding a solution with cost at most α times optimal, for each α ∈ {2, 1.5, 1.01}). For simplicity, consider the offline setting described in §2.1. For each training instance x,\ncreate a new set of fictitious instances x̃1, x̃2, . . . , x̃k, one for each of the k objectives. For each heuristic h, define T (h, x̃i) to be the time that h requires to achieve the ith objective. Then, the average time a schedule or heuristic takes to “solve” the fictitious instances is simply the average time it takes to achieve each of the k objectives on the original instances. If some objectives are more important than others, we can weight the fictitious instances accordingly (the results described in §2 readily extend to weighted sets of instances).\nTo evaluate this approach, we revisit the experiments performed in §4 using the PB’07 competition data, but now we measure the performance of a schedule as the average of (i) the time the schedule takes to find a feasible solution, (ii) the time the schedule takes to find an optimal solution, and (iii) the time the schedule takes to prove optimality (or to prove that the problem is infeasible).\nTable 1 summarizes the results of these experiments. For each track of the PB’07 competition and for each of the three objectives, we define a speedup factor equal to the (lower bound on) average CPU time required by the fastest individual heuristic to achieve that objective, divided by the corresponding quantity for the (suspend-and-resume) greedy schedule, where the greedy algorithm is evaluated under leave-one-out cross-validation. Note that in general, the three different speedup factors listed for each track represent a comparison against three different heuristics.\nTable 1 shows that for all three tracks, we were able to\ngenerate a schedule that simultaneously outperformed each of the original heuristics in terms of each of the three objectives we considered. The results of these experiments could potentially be improved by using features4 as in §4.3, and by sharing upper and lower bounds on the optimal objective function value among heuristics as they are discovered."

Results of this work include the universal restart schedule of Luby et al. [11] and the schedule of Kao et al.

Huberman et al. [8] and Gomes et al.

Independently, Petrik and Zilberstein [12] and Sayag et al. [13] addressed this problem for two classes of schedules: taskswitching schedules and resource-sharing schedules. For each of these two classes of schedules, the problem of computing an optimal schedule is NP-hard, and accordingly their algorithms have exponential running time (as a function of the number of algorithms being scheduled).

[18] presented an improved version of this approach that used a two-step prediction scheme in which the answer to a decision problem is predicted using a binary classifier, and run times are then estimated conditioned on the classifier’s prediction."

For example, Gagliolo and Schmidhuber [4] presented an approach for allocating CPU time among heuristics in an online setting, based on statistical models of the behavior of the heuristics. Although their approach has no rigorous performance guarantees and would not perform well in the worst-case online setting considered in this paper, it would be interesting to compare their approach to ours experimentally."

      "text" : "This paper presented a new technique for addressing the scheduling and machine learning aspects of\nthe algorithm portfolio design problem, and evaluated the technique experimentally. Our main experimental findings can be summarized as follows.\n1. In a number of well-studied problem domains, existing state-of-the-art heuristics can be combined into a new and faster heuristic simply by collecting a few dozen training instances and using them to compute a schedule for interleaving the execution of the existing heuristics.\n2. State-of-the-art anytime algorithms for solving optimization problems can be combined, via a schedule, into an algorithm with better anytime performance.\n3. Instance-specific features can be used to generate a custom schedule for a particular problem instance. Using this approach can result in better performance than using either a pure scheduling approach or a purely feature-based approach.\nAs suggested in §1, our experimental results could potentially be improved in at least two ways. First, we could attempt to predict a heuristic’s remaining running time based on its current state and adapt our schedule accordingly. Second, we could share information among heuristics during the process of solving an instance (e.g., when solving optimization problems, the heuristics could share upper and lower bounds on the optimal objective function value)."
