      "text" : "(LDV) with plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) offers the possibility to reduce the dependence on petroleum fuels together with environmental and economic benefits. The charging activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about 2.89 10-8 and 0.023, respectively.\nKeywords—Energy demand, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle\n(PHEV), smart grids, support vector machines.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe daily residential power demand profile has a high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) which significantly decreases the power grids’ efficiency and causes huge costs for fortifying the power grid's infrastructure, i.e., increasing the power generation capacity, transmission lines, and distribution sector of the grid. This enormous extra investment is just to serve the power demand of the users throughout few peak demand periods. Hence, addressing this problem has motivated considerable research on techniques that can employ the current power grid more efficiently so that more consumers can be served without developing new costly infrastructure [1, 2].\nWhen the penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) becomes common for residential users, we can assume that a new electricity consuming appliance is added to the houses and demands power from the grid. However, PHEVs add quite significant load to the current power grid and in particular the low voltage (LV) electricity distribution sector. Thus, the expected power demand coming from PHEVs should be investigated for proactive grid fortification. On the other hand, it is promising that unlike normal household appliances, PHEVs introduce some power demand elasticity. This elasticity comes from the facts that they do not need on-demand power provision and the commuting patterns differ from one household to another. Therefore, PHEVs demand can be managed to reduce their adverse impacts on the grid and LV sector especially during the peak hours [3].\nDemand Response (DR) and demand side energy management (DSM) in residential sector are considered to play a key role in the smart grid framework. In the recent past many studies have been conducted on DR and DSM and reviewed in [4]. Machine learning and optimization techniques have been proposed to build a DR and home DSM system [5]. Due to the expected large quantity of PHEVs that will be integrated into the power grid in the near future and their complex charging behavior, the impact of substantial PHEVs charging on the power grid needs to be investigated [6]. Due to their ability to deal with nonlinearities of the input data, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic (FL) models are commonly used techniques for modeling and forecasting load demand [7]. The main contribution of this paper is using Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning algorithms, in order to model the uncoordinated charging demand of PHEVs in a residential context. The use of such algorithms has only recently been proposed for shortterm load forecasting [8] and their performances are quite promising.\nReal-world electrical daily demand data measured during whole year 2014 are used. The expected additive power demand from PHEVs is modeled by assigning certain distributions to the required information such as the arrival times at the households and the required charging times for respective PHEVs. A normal distribution for arrival times is\nassumed. Several distributions for charging time represent real-world vehicles’ usage are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Ri distribution and a non-uniform distribution vehicles’ mileage in real-world more accurately focus of this work is providing a unique model to deal with several PHEVs charging scenarios when no PHEV requires charging. A supervised machine learning algorithm is employed in order to find to fit the data. In particular, we aim to find model parameters able to simultaneously cover all and weather scenarios.\nII. REGRESSION VIA SUPERVISED LEARNING\nSupervised learning is the machine inferring a function from labeled training examples [ machine learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input vector and a desired (target) output value (also called the supervisory vector). Support Vector Machines (SVMs) set of very effective supervised learning methods based on statistical learning theory originally developed by The basic idea is to map the original input data using a nonlinear kernel function into a high dimensional feature space and determine an optimal separating hyperplane. SVMs are used for classification (SVC), regression (SVR) and outliers’ detection [10].\nIn a classification problem, the aim is to find an optimal hyperplane that separates sample data into two classes. regression problem the normal to the hyperplane defines a function for which the target and the estimated values are as close as possible. In this study we used SVR in order to estimate a function based on a given training Considering a set of data points D = {(x1, where xi ∈ R n represents the input vector corresponding target and N is the size of the data set general form of ν-SVR [11] estimating function is:\nf(x) = wT φ(x) + b\nwhere φ(x) is the nonlinear map to the feature space and coefficients w and b are obtained by solving the following minimization problem:\nmin ½ ||w||2+ C (ν ε + 1/N ∑ N (ξi\nsubject to\n(w T φ(xi) + b) – ti ≤ ε + ξi,\nti – (w T φ(xi) + b) ≤ ε + ξi * ,\nξi,ξi * ≥ 0, i = 1, …, N, C>0, ε\nwhere C is the regularization parameter, ξi variables, 0 ≤ν≤ 1, and the ε-insensitive loss function means that no loss is assumed if f(x) is in the [ parameter is used to control the number of support vectors\nFig. 1.

EXPECTED PHEV DEMAND MODEL\nIn this section the input to the SVMs model is presented. Electrical daily demand considered for this work consists of real measured data from the huge Electrical Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) database [16], in which power loads from clusters of households were recorded for nearly 200 different locations.\nIn the ERCOT database, 15-minute kWh values related to three different profile types (residential, business and non\nmetered) and eight weather zones are available. Besides dependence on profile type and weather zone, changes depending on the time scale considered: the hour within a given day, business or non-working day, month and season [8]. ERCOT data measured at a cluster of households located in north Texas during four months in 2014 (January, April, July and October) were considered in order to cover all weather scenarios [17].\nAs an example, in Fig. 1 is shown the electrical load averaged over all 15-minute intervals for the above\nRBF kernel is\nγ >0 (4)\n14].

It is evident from Fig. 1 demand on the season and the we modeled a case in which a very low percentage of the light-duty fleet in ERCOT is PHEV\nWithout loss of generality we then daily demand DT in a smart grid under a high penetration PHEVs was the sum of real PHEVs demand Ed:\nwhere Ed =E{Cd(t)} and Cd(t) is\nIn order to obtain the expected power demand from PHEVs, commuting data collection by surveying can be carried out. However, in [12 assigning certain distributions to the required information such as the arrival times at the households and the required charging times for respective PHEVs can provide a closed form expression to show the uncoordinated charging d of a PHEV mathematically. In fact, PHEVs’ power demand depends on their mileage as well as time. Hence, we used the distributions p\n[19]. A Gaussian distribution in modulo 24 hours w and σ2 = 10 has been assigne uniform distribution over the interval [1 uniform distribution coming from driving patterns National Household Travel Survey ( Gaussian with positive support and a Rician distribution has been considered for the required charging time parameters of the distributions such that they have the same mean and variance. The authors show distributions match the practical commuting data.\nThe curves in Fig. 2 uncoordinated demand of a PHEV when the charging demand Cd(t) is defined as follows [13]\n,0, where p is the outlet power delivery According to Fig. 2, we can observe that the expected daily demand from Rician and Gaussian with positive support distributions tends to the same curve uniform distribution. We should notice that this happens when the first and second order statistics of these two distributions are adjusted to be the same. Thus, and non-uniform distribution for then built our dataset by generating quarter for each day in considered months demand scenarios: no PHEVs, uniform and non distribution for Tc.\nEffectiveness of load demand verified by minimizing the mean the model f(xi) and the target datum\nthe dependence of electrical hour within a day.

Model and kernel parameters were then optimized searching for the best MSE and MAPE values across generated dataset.\nIV. MODEL PERFORMANCES\nIn the present section the performances of the proposed νSVR model are reported. For the practical use of SVR, authors in [22] showed that SVMs with normalized input data into the [0, 1] range outperform those with unscaled input data. Therefore, the SVR model was fed with normalized data, and then the model outputs were returned to their original scale. The load demand model has been optimized by minimizing both the MSE and MAPE for all four months and for all charging scenarios.\nIn this way we looked for a single set of model and kernel parameters that was suitable for the whole year, regardless of the PHEVs charging demand. ν-SVR model with RBF kernel outperformed polynomial kernels. This was not a surprising result, since it is known [23] that when the dynamics of the signal under investigation are nonlinear, SVR with RBF returns more satisfactory results than other kernels such as linear or polynomial kernel.\nTable I shows the results obtained by using ν-SVR model with ERCOT data measured during whole year 2014 in presence of three different expected PHEVs charging demand scenarios: no PHEV charging demand, uniform and nonuniform distribution for required charging time. A value of p = 2 kW was used for the outlet power delivery.\nThe following settings for model and kernel parameters have been found to be optimal for the SVM algorithm: C=1000, ν =0.5 and γ =10. Such values have been obtained performing a coarse/fine grid search in the parameters space [8]. The proposed method required a processing time of about 13 minutes on a commercial PC platform (2 GB RAM, 3.4 GHz CPU). Results in Table I represent the average MSE and MAPE values over the considered period given a PHEVs charging scenario.\nWe can summarize model performances by taking the maximum (worst) values of MSE and MAPE over all charging and weather scenarios and obtaining 2.887 10 -8 and 0.0229, respectively. Maximum MSE and MAPE values are observed during additional electric demand for heaters on winter (with no PHEVs charging demand) and for air conditioners on summer (with PHEVs charging time uniformly distributed).\nIt can also be seen from Fig. 3 where DT, evaluated with electrical load as in Fig. 1 and assuming three different PHEVs’ demand scenarios, is reported for January and July 2014. In [8], the modeling approach proposed for this work was used for one-day ahead demand forecasting based on nd days as training data; in that case main objective was to predict the load demand by minimizing nd and PHEVs penetration was not considered: MAPE values ranged from 0.81 to 1.03 depending on the season. Further work is then needed to employ SVMs for short-term load demand forecasting in presence of PHEVs penetration. This stems from the fact that MAPE = 0.9%, obtained using Wavelet Transformation Error Correction-ANN, is reported in [24] and reviewed in [7] as the best result for short-term load demand forecasting. By comparing results in [24] and [8], we can observe that, although MAPE values are within the same range of forecast error, main advantages of using SVMs rather than ANNs are that the computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input and the provided solution is global and unique [25].\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this study, a method based on supervised machine learning was proposed in the Smart Grid framework in order to model the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. The effectiveness of the model was tested using real-world data from a cluster of residential households and evaluated by means of MSE and MAPE. The total daily demand was assumed as the sum of real demand data and expected power demand from PHEVs. The latter was modeled by assigning several probability distributions to the starting times of charging and the required charging times. Main advantages of using the proposed method rather than other artificial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks are that the computational complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the input, model size is automatically selected and the provided solution is global and unique."

The charging activity of PHEVs will certainly introduce new load to the power grid. In the framework of the development of a smarter grid, the primary focus of the present study is to propose a model for the electrical daily demand in presence of PHEVs charging. Expected PHEV demand is modeled by the PHEV charging time and the starting time of charge according to real world data. A normal distribution for starting time of charge is assumed. Several distributions for charging time are considered: uniform distribution, Gaussian with positive support, Rician distribution and a non-uniform distribution coming from driving patterns in real-world data. We generate daily demand profiles by using real-world residential profiles throughout 2014 in the presence of different expected PHEV demand models. Support vector machines (SVMs), a set of supervised machine learning models, are employed in order to find the best model to fit the data. SVMs with radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial kernels were tested. Model performances are evaluated by means of mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Best results are obtained with RBF kernel: maximum (worst) values for MSE and MAPE were about 2.89 10 and 0.023, respectively. Keywords—Energy demand, plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), smart grids, support vector machines.",
