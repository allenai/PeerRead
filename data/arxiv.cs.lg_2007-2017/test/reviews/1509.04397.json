{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Sep-2015", "title": "Exponential Family Matrix Completion under Structural Constraints", "abstract": "We consider the matrix completion problem of recovering a structured matrix from noisy and partial measurements. Recent works have proposed tractable estimators with strong statistical guarantees for the case where the underlying matrix is low--rank, and the measurements consist of a subset, either of the exact individual entries, or of the entries perturbed by additive Gaussian noise, which is thus implicitly suited for thin--tailed continuous data. Arguably, common applications of matrix completion require estimators for (a) heterogeneous data--types, such as skewed--continuous, count, binary, etc., (b) for heterogeneous noise models (beyond Gaussian), which capture varied uncertainty in the measurements, and (c) heterogeneous structural constraints beyond low--rank, such as block--sparsity, or a superposition structure of low--rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. In this paper, we provide a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion by considering a matrix completion setting wherein the matrix entries are sampled from any member of the rich family of exponential family distributions; and impose general structural constraints on the underlying matrix, as captured by a general regularizer $\\mathcal{R}(.)$. We propose a simple convex regularized $M$--estimator for the generalized framework, and provide a unified and novel statistical analysis for this general class of estimators. We finally corroborate our theoretical results on simulated datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 04:49:57 GMT  (1204kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04397v1", "20 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["suriya gunasekar", "pradeep ravikumar", "joydeep ghosh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.04397"}
