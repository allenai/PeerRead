      "text" : "It used to be the case that the most accurate dependency parsers made global decisions and employed exact decoding. But transition-based dependency parsers (TBDPs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance, despite the fact that for efficiency reasons, they are usually trained to make local, rather than global, decisions and the decoding process is done approximately, rather than exactly (Weiss et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015; Andor et al., 2016). The key efficiency issue for decoding is as follows. In order to make accurate (local) attachment decisions, historically, TBDPs have required a large set of features in order to access rich information about particular positions in the stack and buffer of the current parser configuration. But consulting many positions means that although polynomial-time exact-decoding algo-\nrithms do exist, having been introduced by Huang and Sagae (2010) and Kuhlmann et al. (2011), unfortunately, they are prohibitively costly in practice, since the number of positions considered can factor into the exponent of the running time. For instance, Huang and Sagae employ a fairly reduced set of nine positions, but the worst-case running time for the exact-decoding version of their algorithm is Opn6q (originally reported as Opn7q) for a length-n sentence. As an extreme case, Dyer et al. (2015) use an LSTM to summarize arbitrary information on the stack, which completely rules out dynamic programming.\nRecently, Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a) and Cross and Huang (2016a) applied bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005, bi-LSTMs) to derive feature representations for parsing, because these networks capture wide-window contextual information well. Collectively, these two sets of authors demonstrated that with bi-LSTMs, four positional features suffice for the arc-hybrid parsing system (K&G), and three suffice for arcstandard (C&H).1\nInspired by their work, we arrive at a minimal feature set for arc-hybrid and arc-eager: it contains only two positional bi-LSTM vectors, suffers almost no loss in performance in comparison to larger sets, and out-performs a single position. (Details regarding the situation with arc-standard can be found in §2.)\nOur minimal feature set plugs into Huang and Sagae’s and Kuhlmann et al.’s dynamic program-\n1We note that K&G were not focused on minimizing positions, although they explicitly noted the implications of doing so: “While not explored in this work, [fewer positions] results in very compact state signatures, [which is] very appealing for use in transition-based parsers that employ dynamicprogramming search” (pg. 319). C&H also noted in their follow-up (Cross and Huang, 2016b) the possibility of future work using dynamic programming thanks to simple features.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n09 40\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 A\nug 2\n01 7\nming framework to produce the first implementation of Opn3q exact decoders for arc-hybrid and arc-eager parsers. We also enable and implement Opn3q global training methods. Empirically, ensembles containing our minimal-feature, globallytrained and exactly-decoded models produce the best unlabeled attachment score (UAS) reported (to our knowledge) on the Chinese Treebank and the “second-best-in-class” result on the English Penn Treebank.2\nAdditionally, we provide a slight update to the theoretical connections previously drawn by Gómez-Rodrı́guez, Carroll, and Weir (2008, 2011) between TBDPs and the graph-based dependency parsing algorithms of Eisner (1996) and Eisner and Satta (1999), including results regarding the arc-eager parsing system."

      "text" : "TBDPs incrementally process a sentence by making transitions through search states representing parser configurations. Three of the main transition systems in use today (formal introduction in §3.1) all maintain the following two data structures in their configurations: (1) a stack of partially parsed subtrees and (2) a buffer (mostly) of unprocessed sentence tokens.\nTo featurize configurations for use in a scoring function, it is common to have features that extract information about the first several elements on the stack and the buffer, such as their word forms and part-of-speech (POS) tags. We refer to these as positional features, as each feature relates to a particular position in the stack or buffer. Typically, millions of sparse indicator features (often developed via manual engineering) are used.\nIn contrast, Chen and Manning (2014) introduce a feature set consisting of dense word-, POS-, and dependency-label embeddings. While dense, these features are for the same 18 positions that have been typically used in prior work. Recently, Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a) and Cross and Huang (2016a) adopt bi-directional LSTMs, which have nice expressiveness and context-sensitivity properties, to reduce the number of positions considered down to four and three,\n2Our ideas were subsequently adapted to the labeled setting by Shi, Wu, Chen, and Cheng (2017) in their submission to the CoNLL 2017 shared task on Universal Dependencies parsing. Their team achieved the second-highest labeled attachment score in general and had the top average performance on the surprise languages.\nfor different transition systems, respectively. This naturally begs the question, what is the lower limit on the number of positional features necessary for a parser to perform well? Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a) reason that for the arc-hybrid system, the first and second items on the stack and the first buffer item — denoted by s0, s1, and b0, respectively — are required; they additionally include the third stack item, s2, because it may not be adjacent to the others in the original sentence. For arc-standard, Cross and Huang (2016a) argue for the necessity of s0, s1, and b0.\nWe address the lower-limit question empirically, and find that, surprisingly, two positions suffice for the greedy arc-eager and arc-hybrid parsers. We also provide empirical support for Cross and Huang’s argument for the necessity of three features for arc-standard. In the rest of this section, we explain our experiments, run only on an English development set, that support this conclusion; the results are depicted in Table 1. We later explore the implementation implications in §3-4 and then test-set parsing-accuracy in §6.\nWe employ the same model architecture as Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a). Specifically, we first use a bi-LSTM to encode an n-token sentence, treated as a sequence of per-token concatenations of word- and POS-tag embeddings, into a sequence of vectors r ÑÐ w1, . . . , ÑÐ wns, where each ÑÐ wi\nis the output of the bi-LSTM at time step i. (The double-arrow notation for these vectors emphasizes the bi-directionality of their origin). Then, for a given parser configuration, stack positions are represented by ÑÐ s j , defined as ÑÐ wipsjq where ipsjq gives the position in the sentence of the token that is the head of the tree in sj . Similarly, buffer positions are represented by ÑÐ b j , defined as ÑÐ wipbjq for the token at buffer position j. Finally, as in Chen and Manning (2014), we use a multilayer perceptron to score possible transitions from the given configuration, where the input is the concatenation of some selection of the ÑÐ s js and ÑÐ b ks. We use greedy decoders, and train the models with dynamic oracles (Goldberg and Nivre, 2013).\nTable 1 reports the parsing accuracy that results for feature sets of size four, three, two, and one for three commonly-used transition systems. The data is the development section of the English Penn Treebank (PTB), and experimental settings are as described in our other experimental section, §6. We see that we can go down to three or, in the arc-hybrid and arc-eager transition systems, even two positions with very little loss in performance, but not further. We therefore call t ÑÐ s0, ÑÐ b 0u our minimal feature set with respect to arc-hybrid and arc-eager, and empirically confirm that Cross and Huang’s t ÑÐ s0, ÑÐ s 1, ÑÐ b 0u is minimal for arc-standard; see Table 1 for a summary.3"

With t ÑÐ s 0, ÑÐ b 0u, in the arc-standard case, situations can arise where there are multiple possible transitions with missing information. In contrast, in the arc-hybrid case, there is only one possible transition with missing information (namely, reñ, introduced in §3.1); perhaps ÑÐ s 1 is therefore not so crucial for arc-hybrid in practice?\ntions. For a sentence to be parsed, the system starts from a corresponding initial configuration, and attempts to sequentially apply transitions until a configuration corresponding to a full parse is produced. Formally, a transition system is defined as S “ pC, T, cs, Cτ q, where C is a nonempty set of configurations, each t P T : C á C is a transition function between configurations, cs is an initialization function that maps an input sentence to an initial configuration, and Cτ Ď C is a set of terminal configurations.\nAll systems we consider share a common tripartite representation for configurations: when we write c “ pσ, β,Aq for some c P C, we are referring to a stack σ of partially parsed subtrees; a buffer β of unprocessed tokens and, optionally, at its beginning, a subtree with only left descendants; and a set A of elements ph,mq, each of which is an attachment (dependency arc) with head h and modifier m.4 We write mðh to indicate that m left-modifies h, and hñm to indicate that m rightmodifies h. For a sentence w “ w1, ..., wn, the initial configuration is pσ0, β0, A0q, where σ0 and A0 are empty and β0 “ rROOT|w1, ..., wns; ROOT is a special node denoting the root of the parse tree5 (vertical bars are a notational convenience for indicating different parts of the buffer or stack; our convention is to depict the buffer first element leftmost, and to depict the stack first element rightmost). All terminal configurations have an empty buffer and a stack containing only ROOT.\nArc-Standard The arc-standard system (Nivre, 2004) is motivated by bottom-up parsing: each dependent has to be complete before being attached. The three transitions, shift (sh, move a token from the buffer to the stack), right-reduce (reñ, reduce and attach a right modifier), and left-reduce (reð, reduce and attach a left modifier), are defined as:\nshrpσ, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ|b0, β, Aq reñrpσ|s1|s0, β, Aqs “ pσ|s1, β, AY tps1, s0quq reðrpσ|s1|s0, β, Aqs “ pσ|s0, β, AY tps0, s1quq\nArc-Hybrid The arc-hybrid system (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Gómez-Rodrı́guez et al., 2008; Kuhlmann et al., 2011) has the same definitions of sh and reñ as arc-standard, but forces\n4For simplicity, we only present unlabeled parsing here. See Shi et al. (2017) for labeled-parsing results.\n5Other presentations place ROOT at the end of the buffer or omit it entirely (Ballesteros and Nivre, 2013).\nthe collection of left modifiers before right modifiers via its b0-modifier reð transition. This contrasts with arc-standard, where the attachment of left and right modifiers can be interleaved on the stack.\nshrpσ, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ|b0, β, Aq reñrpσ|s1|s0, β, Aqs “ pσ|s1, β, AY tps1, s0quq reðrpσ|s0, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ, b0|β,AY tpb0, s0quq\nArc-Eager In contrast to the former two systems, the arc-eager system (Nivre, 2003) makes attachments as early as possible — even if a modifier has not yet received all of its own modifiers. This behavior is accomplished by decomposing the right-reduce transition into two independent transitions, one making the attachment (ra) and one reducing the right-attached child (re).\nshrpσ, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ|b0, β, Aq reðrpσ|s0, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ, b0|β,AY tpb0, s0quq\n(precondition: s0 not attached to any word)\nrarpσ|s0, b0|β,Aqs “ pσ|s0|b0, β, AY tps0, b0quq rerpσ|s0, β, Aqs “ pσ, β,Aq\n(precondition: s0 has been attached to its head)"

(2011) reformulate the three transition systems just discussed as deduction systems (Pereira and Warren, 1983; Shieber et al., 1995), wherein transitions serve as inference rules; these are given as the lefthand sides of the first three subfigures in Figure 1. For a given w “ w1, ..., wn, assertions take the form ri, j, ks (or, when applicable, a two-index shorthand to be discussed soon), meaning that there exists a sequence of transitions that, starting from a configuration wherein headps0q “ wi, results in an ending configuration wherein headps0q “ wj and headpb0q “ wk. If we define w0 as ROOT and wn`1 as an endof-sentence marker, then the goal theorem can be stated as r0, 0, n` 1s.\nFor arc-standard, we depict an assertion ri, h, ks as a subtree whose root (head) is the token at h. Assertions of the form ri, i, ks play an important role for arc-hybrid and arc-eager, and we employ the special shorthand ri, ks for them in Figure 1. In that figure, we also graphically depict such situations as two consecutive half-trees with roots wi and wk, where all tokens between i and k are already attached. The superscript b in an arc-eager\nassertion rib, js is an indicator variable for whether wi has been attached to its head (b “ 1) or not (b “ 0) after the transition sequence is applied.\nKuhlmann et al. (2011) show that all three deduction systems can be directly “tabularized” and dynamic programming (DP) can be applied, such that, ignoring for the moment the issue of incorporating complex features (we return to this later), time and space needs are low-order polynomial. Specifically, as the two-index shorthand ri, js suggests, arc-eager and arc-hybrid systems can be implemented to take Opn2q space and Opn3q time; the arc-standard system requires Opn3q space and Opn4q time (if one applies the so-called hook trick (Eisner and Satta, 1999)).\nSince an Opn4q running time is not sufficiently practical even in the simple-feature case, in the remainder of this paper we consider only the archybrid and arc-eager systems, not arc-standard."

We assume access to functions ft that score individual configurations, where these functions are indexed by the transition functions t P T . For a fixed transition sequence t “ t1, t2, . . ., we use ci to denote the configuration that results after applying ti.\nTypically, for efficiency reasons, greedy left-toright decoding is employed: the next transition t˚i out of ci´1 is arg maxt ftpci´1q, so that past and future decisions are not taken into account. The score F ptq for the transition sequence is induced by summing the relevant ftipci´1q values.\nHowever, our use of minimal feature sets enables direct computation of an argmax over the entire space of transition sequences, arg maxt F ptq, via dynamic programming, because our positions don’t rely on any information “outside” the deduction rule indices, thus eliminating the need for ad-\nditional state-keeping. We show how to integrate the scoring functions for the arc-eager system; the arc-hybrid system is handled similarly. The score-annotated rules are as follows: rib, js : v\nrj0, j ` 1s : 0 pshq rkb, is : v1 ri0, js : v2 rkb, js : v1 ` v2 `∆ preðq\nwhere ∆ “ fshp ÑÐ wk, ÑÐ wiq ` freðp ÑÐ wi, ÑÐ wjq — abusing notation by referring to configurations by their features.

This means that the initial condition for ri0, js is met, so we can take the sequence of transitions asserted by ri0, js— say it has score v2 — and finally a left-reduce transition to finish composing the larger transition sequence. Notice that the scores for sh and ra are 0, as the scoring of these transitions is accounted for by reduce rules elsewhere in the sequence."

      "text" : "Our minimal feature set brings implementation of practical optimal algorithms to TBDPs, whereas previously only graph-based dependency parsers (GBDPs) — a radically different, non-incremental paradigm — enjoyed the ability to deploy them. Interestingly, for both the transition- and graphbased paradigms, the optimal algorithms build dependency trees bottom-up from local structures. It is thus natural to wonder if there are deeper, more formal connections between the two.\nIn previous work, Kuhlmann et al. (2011) related the arc-standard system to the classic CKY algorithm (Cocke, 1969; Kasami, 1965; Younger, 1967) in a manner clearly suggested by Figure 1a; CKY can be viewed as a very simple graph-based approach. Gómez-Rodrı́guez et al. (2008, 2011) formally prove that sequences of steps in the edgefactored GBDP (Eisner, 1996) can be used to emulate any individual step in the arc-hybrid system (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) and the Eisner and Satta (1999, Figure 1d) version. However, they did not draw an explicitly direct connection between Eisner and Satta (1999) and TBDPs.\nHere, we provide an update to these previous findings, stated in terms of the expressiveness of scoring functions, considered as parameterization.\nFor the edge-factored GBDP, we write the score for an edge as fGp ÑÐ h, ÑÐ mq, where h is the head and m the modifier. A tree’s score is the sum of its edge scores. We say that a parameterized dependency parsing model A contains model B if for every instance of parameterization in model B, there exists an instance of model A such that the two models assign the same score to every parse tree. We claim:\nLemma 1. The arc-eager model presented in §4.1 contains the edge-factored model.\nProof Sketch. Consider a given edge-factored GBDP parameterized by fG. For any parse tree, every edge iðj involves two deduction rules, and their contribution to the score of the final proof is fsh( ÑÐ wk, ÑÐ wi) ` freðp ÑÐ wi, ÑÐ wjq. We set fsh( ÑÐ wk, ÑÐ wi) “ 0 and freðp ÑÐ wi, ÑÐ wjq “ fGp ÑÐ wj , ÑÐ wiq. Similarly, for edges kñi in the other direction, we set\nfra( ÑÐ wk, ÑÐ wi) “ fGp ÑÐ wk, ÑÐ wiq and frep ÑÐ wi, ÑÐ wjq “ 0. The parameterization we arrive at emulates exactly the scoring model of fG.\nWe further claim that the arc-eager model is more expressive than not only the edge-factored GBDP, but also the arc-hybrid model in our paper.\nLemma 2. The arc-eager model contains the archybrid model.\nProof Sketch. We leverage the fact that the arceager model divides the sh transition in the archybrid model into two separate transitions, sh and ra. When we constrain the parameters fsh “ fra in the arc-eager model, the model hypothesis space becomes exactly the same as arc-hybrid’s.\nThe extra expressiveness of the arc-eager model comes from the scoring functions fsh and fre that capture structural contexts other than headmodifier relations. Unlike traditional higher-order graph-based parsing that directly models relations such as siblinghood (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) or grandparenthood (Carreras, 2007), however, the arguments in those two functions do not have any fixed type of structural interactions."

      "text" : "Data and Evaluation We experimented with English and Chinese. For English, we used the Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008) conversion (via the Stanford parser 3.3.0) of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB). As is standard, we used §2-21 of the Wall Street Journal for training, §22 for development,\nand §23 for testing; POS tags were predicted using 10-way jackknifing with the Stanford max entropy tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). For Chinese, we used the Penn Chinese Treebank 5.1 (Xue et al., 2002, CTB), with the same splits and head-finding rules for conversion to dependencies as Zhang and Clark (2008). We adopted the CTB’s goldstandard tokenization and POS tags. We report unlabeled attachment score (UAS) and sentencelevel unlabeled exact match (UEM). Following prior work, all punctuation is excluded from evaluation. For each model, we initialized the network parameters with 5 different random seeds and report performance average and standard deviation.\nImplementation Details Our model structures reproduce those of Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016a). We use 2-layer bi-directional LSTMs with 256 hidden cell units. Inputs are concatenations of 28-dimensional randomly-initialized partof-speech embeddings and 100-dimensional word vectors initialized from GloVe vectors (Pennington et al., 2014) (English) and pre-trained skipgram-model vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013) (Chinese). The concatenation of the bi-LSTM feature vectors is passed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer which has 256 hidden units and activation function tanh. We set the dropout rate for the bi-LSTM (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016) and MLP (Srivastava et al., 2014) for each model according to development-set performance.6 All parameters except the word embed-\n6For bi-LSTM input and recurrent connections, we consider dropout rates in t0., 0.2u, and for MLP, t0., 0.4u.\ndings are initialized uniformly (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). Approximately 1,000 tokens form a mini-batch for sub-gradient computation. We train each model for 20 epochs and perform model selection based on development UAS. The proposed structured loss function is optimized via Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015). The neural network computation is based on the python interface to DyNet (Neubig et al., 2017), and the exact decoding algorithms are implemented in Cython.7\nMain Results We implement exact decoders for the arc-hybrid and arc-eager systems, and present the test performance of different model configurations in Table 2, comparing global models with local models. All models use the same decoder for testing as during the training process. Though no global decoder for the arc-standard system has been explored in this paper, its local models are listed for comparison. We also include an edgefactored graph-based model, which is conventionally trained globally. The edge-factored model scores bi-LSTM features for each head-modifier pair; a maximum spanning tree algorithm is used to find the tree with the highest sum of edge scores. For this model, we use Dozat and Man-\n7See https://github.com/tzshi/dp-parser-emnlp17 .\nning’s (2017) biaffine scoring model, although in our case the model size is smaller.8\nAnalogously to the dev-set results given in §2, on the test data, the minimal feature sets perform as well as larger ones in locally-trained models. And there exists a clear trend of global models outperforming local models for the two different transition systems on both datasets. This illustrates the effectiveness of exact decoding and global training. Of the three types of global models, the arceager arguably has the edge, an empirical finding resonating with our theoretical comparison of their model expressiveness.\nComparison with State-of-the-Art Models Figure 2 compares our algorithms’ results with those of the state-of-the-art.9 Our models are competitive and an ensemble of 15 globallytrained models (5 models each for arc-eager DP, arc-hybrid DP and edge-factored) achieves 95.33 and 90.22 on PTB and CTB, respectively, reach-\n8The same architecture and model size as other transitionbased global models is used for fair comparison.\n9We exclude Choe and Charniak (2016), Kuncoro et al.

Two possibilities are to create even better training methods, and to find some way to extend our run-time improvements to other transition systems. It would also be interesting to further investigate relationships between graph-based and dependency-based parsing. In §5 we have mentioned important earlier work in this regard, and provided an update to those formal findings.\nIn our work, we have brought exact decoding, which was formerly the province solely of graphbased parsing, to the transition-based paradigm.

In their author response, TS&LL invited the reviewer to co-author, suggesting that they ask the conference organizers to make the connection between anonymous reviewer and anonymous authors. All three of us are truly grateful to PC co-chair Regina Barzilay for implementing this idea, bringing us together!\nWe also thank Kai Sun for help with Chinese word vectors, and Xilun Chen, Yao Cheng, Dezhong Deng, Juneki Hong, Jon Kleinberg, Ryan McDonald, Ashudeep Singh, and Kai Zhao for discussions and suggestions. TS and LL were supported in part by a Google focused research grant to Cornell University. LH was supported in part by NSF IIS-1656051, DARPA N66001-17-24030, and a Google Faculty Research Award."
