      "text" : "Here we propose a measure of bifuzzy entropy which is a generalization of fuzzy entropy. Complementary, a bifuzzy syntropy is also proposed. The proposed bifuzzy entropy is the similarity measure between the considered elements and its complement while the bifuzzy syntropy is the dissimilarity measure [15]. The measures of similarity/dissimilarity are computed in the framework of five-valued knowledge representation. The presented formulae describe entropy/syntropy for a single element belonging to a bifuzzy set. For a set we must sum the entropy/syntropy of all its elements. The proposed measure of entropy reaches its maximum for elements for which membership function is equal to non-membership function. The structure of entropy offers the advantage we immediately are able to indicate possible reasons of the missing information: the inconsistency, the incompleteness, the lack of distinguish between membership/non-membership and their negations. The paper has the following structure: section 2 presents the bifuzzy sets and their particular forms. Section 3 enumerates some existent four and five logics having partial order structure. Section 4 presents a five-valued logic that uses three neutral values: inconsistent, incomplete and ambiguous. Section 5 presents a five-valued representation of bifuzzy sets. Section 6 presents measures for similarity, entropy and syntropy of bifuzzy sets. Finally, the conclusions are presented in section 7.\nVasile Pătraşcu"

Taking into account the geometrical form of the square and its symmetry the first values of number of classes could be 4, 5 or 9. For 9 classes, the model is too complicated. For 4 classes we can not consider the center of the square, where the entropy of fuzzy sets has its maximum value.

      "text" : "For a non-crisp set, uncertainty results from the imprecise boundaries or it results from the lack of crisp distinction between the elements belonging and not belonging\nVasile Pătraşcu\nto a set. The uncertainty of fuzzy sets is called fuzziness. A measure of fuzziness is the entropy first mentioned by Zadeh [21]. Kaufman [10] proposed to measure a degree of fuzziness of any fuzzy set A by a metric distance between its membership function and the membership function of its nearest crisp set. Another way given by Yager [16] was to view a degree of fuzziness in term of a lack of distinction between the fuzzy set and its complement. De Luca and Termini [13] introduced some requirements for entropy of fuzzy sets. Szmidt and Kacprzyk have extended these requirements from fuzzy sets to intuitionistic fuzzy sets. Kosko [11] proposed to measure the fuzzy entropy by the ratio between the distance to the nearest crisp element and the distance to the farthest crisp element. But this formula is nothing else then a similarity measure between the considered elements and its complement. This formula will be used in order to define the bifuzzy entropy. Hence in fact the measure is not unique, because of the particular form of similarity that is used. Moreover, such entropy is dependent on the representation of element x . Firstly, we define de\nsimilarity of bifuzzy values. Let there be a bifuzzy value 2]1,0[∈),(= x and its\nfive-valued representation ),,,,( iucft .

In order to have a complete description of entropy we define the following vector:\n),,( iuce  \n(6.6)\nOur vector approach of bifuzzy entropy is close to that defined by Grzegorzewski and Mrowka for intuitionistic fuzzy sets [8]. Also, we define the syntropy [18],[19]:\nft  (6.7)\nWe must underline that  is a measure for syntropy because it is the negation of\nentropy. Also this parameter is known as negentropy. The syntropy has two components: the index of truth and index of falsity. In addition, we define the following vector of syntropy:\n),( ft \n(6.8)\nEntropy (6.5) and syntropy (6.7) verify the equalities: 2]1,0[,  yx )()()()( yexeyxeyxe \n)()()()( yxyxyx  \nVasile Pătraşcu\nwhere  and  are defined by (5.6) and (5.7).
