It typically includes the identification of argumentative components, e.g. claims, as the central component of an argument. We perform a qualitative analysis across six different datasets and show that these appear to conceptualize claims quite differently. To learn about the consequences of such different conceptualizations of claim for practical applications, we carried out extensive experiments using state-of-the-art featurerich and deep learning systems, to identify claims in a cross-domain fashion. While the divergent perception of claims in different datasets is indeed harmful to crossdomain classification, we show that there are shared properties on the lexical level as well as system configurations that can help to overcome these gaps."

      "text" : "The key component of an argument is the claim. This simple observation has not changed much since the early works on argumentation by Aristotle more than two thousand years ago, although argumentation scholars provide us with a plethora of often clashing theories and models (van Eemeren et al., 2014). Despite the lack of a precise definition in the contemporary argumentation theory, Toulmin’s influential work on argumentation in the 1950’s introduced a claim as an ‘assertion that deserves our attention’ (Toulmin, 2003, p. 11); recent works describe a claim as ‘a statement that is in dispute and that we are trying to support with reasons’ (Govier, 2010).\nArgument mining, a computational counterpart of manual argumentation analysis, is a recent\ngrowing sub-field of NLP (Peldszus and Stede, 2013a). ‘Mining’ arguments usually involves several steps like separating argumentative from nonargumentative text units, parsing argument structures, and recognizing argument components such as claims—the main focus of this article. Claim identification itself is an important prerequisite for applications such as fake checking (Vlachos and Riedel, 2014), politics and legal affairs (Surdeanu et al., 2010), and science (Park and Blake, 2012).\nAlthough claims can be identified with a promising level of accuracy in typical argumentative discourse such as persuasive essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2014), less homogeneous resources, for instance online discourse, pose challenges to current systems (Habernal and Gurevych, 2017). Furthermore, existing argument mining approaches are often limited to a single, specific domain like legal documents (Mochales-Palau and Moens, 2009), microtexts (Peldszus and Stede, 2015), Wikipedia articles (Levy et al., 2014; Rinott et al., 2015) or student essays (Stab and Gurevych, 2016). The problem of generalizing systems or features and their robustness across heterogeneous datasets thus remains fairly unexplored.\nThis situation motivated us to perform a detailed analysis of the concept of claims (as a key component of an argument) in existing argument mining datasets from different domains.1 We first review and qualitatively analyze six existing publicly available datasets for argument mining (§3), showing that the conceptualizations of claims in these datasets differ largely. In a next step, we analyze the influence of these differences for crossdomain claim identification. We propose several computational models for claim identification, including systems using linguistically motivated\n1We take the machine learning perspective in which different domains mean data drawn from different distributions (Murphy, 2012, p. 297).\nfeatures (§4.1) and recent deep neural networks (§4.2), and rigorously evaluate them on and across all datasets (§5). Finally, in order to better understand the factors influencing the performance in a cross-domain scenario, we perform an extensive quantitative analysis on the results (§6).\nOur analysis reveals that despite obvious differences in conceptualizations of claims across datasets, there are some shared properties on the lexical level which can be useful for claim identification in heterogeneous or unknown domains. Furthermore, we found that the choice of the source (training) domain is crucial when the target domain is unknown and that it is preferable to train on a suitable single domain rather than mixed domains. We release our experimental framework to help other researchers build upon our findings."

      "text" : "Existing approaches to argument mining can be roughly categorized into (a) multi-document approaches which recognize claims and evidence across several documents and (b) discourse level approaches addressing the argumentative structure within a single document. Multi-document approaches have been proposed e.g. by Levy et al. (2014) and Rinott et al. (2015) for mining claims and corresponding evidence for a predefined topic over multiple Wikipedia articles. Nevertheless, to date most approaches and datasets deal with single-document argumentative discourse. This paper takes the discourse level perspective, as we aim to assess multiple datasets from different authors and compare their notion of claims.\nMochales-Palau and Moens (2009) experimented at the discourse level using feature-rich SVM and a hand-crafted context-free grammar in order to recognize claims and premises in legal decisions. Their best results for claims achieved 74.1% F1 using domain-dependent key phrases, token counts, location features, information about verbs, and the tense of the sentence. Peldszus and Stede (2015) presented an approach based on a minimum spanning tree algorithm and model the global structure of arguments considering argumentative relations, the stance and the function of argument components. Their approach yields 86.9% F1 for recognizing claims in English ‘microtexts’. Habernal and Gurevych (2017) cast argument component identification as BIO sequence labeling and jointly model separation of argumen-\ntative from non-argumentative text units and identification of argument component boundaries together with their types. They achieved 25.1% macro F1 with a combination of topic, sentiment, semantic, discourse and embedding features using structural SVM. Stab and Gurevych (2014) identified claims and other argument components in student essays. They experimented with several classifiers and achieved the best performance of 53.8% F1 score using SVM with structural, lexical, syntactic, indicator and contextual features. Although the above-mentioned approaches achieved promising results in particular domains, their ability to generalize over heterogeneous text types and domains remains unanswered.\nRosenthal and McKeown (2012) set out to explore this direction by conducting cross-domain experiments for detecting claims in blog articles from LiveJournal and discussions taken from Wikipedia. However, they focused on relatively similar datasets that both stem from the social media domain and in addition annotated the datasets themselves, leading to an identical conceptualization of the notion of claim. Although AlKhatib et al. (2016) also deal with cross-domain experiments, they address a different task; namely identification of argumentative sentences. Further, their goals are different: they want to improve argumentation mining via distant supervision rather than detecting differences in the notions of a claim.\nDomain adaptation techniques (Daume III, 2007) try to address the frequently observed drop in classifier performances entailed by a dissimilarity of training and test data distributions. Since techniques such as learning generalized crossdomain representations in an unsupervised manner (Blitzer et al., 2006; Pan et al., 2010; Glorot et al., 2011; Yang and Eisenstein, 2015) have been criticized for targeting specific source and target domains, it has alternatively been proposed to learn universal representations from general domains in order to render a learner robust across all possible domain shifts (Müller and Schütze, 2015; Schnabel and Schütze, 2013). Our approach is in a similar vein. On the one hand, rather than trying to improve classifier performances for a specific source-target domain pair, we want to detect differences between these pairs. On the other hand, we are looking for universal feature sets or classifiers that perform generally well for claim identi-\nfication across varying source and target domains."

The scheme comprises major claims, claims and premises at the clause level (αU 0.77).

      "text" : "In order to investigate how claim annotations are tackled in the chosen corpora, one co-author manually analyzed 50 randomly sampled claims from each corpus.2 The observed characteristics are backed by argumentation theory (Schiappa and Nordin, 2013) and include among other things the claim type, signaling words and discourse markers.\nBiran and Rambow (2011b) do not back-up their claim annotations by any common argumentation theory but rather state that claims are utterances which convey subjective information and anticipate the question ‘why are you telling me that?’ and need to be supported by justifications. Using this rather loose definition, a claim might be any subjective statement that is justified by the author. Detailed examination of the LiveJournal corpus (OC) revealed that sentences with claims are extremely noisy. Their content ranges from a single word, to emotional expressions of personal regret, to general Web-chat nonsense or posts without any clear argumentative purpose. The Wikipedia Talk Page corpus (WTP) contains claims typical to Wikipedia quality discussions and policy claims (Schiappa and Nordin, 2013) are present as well. However, a small number of nonsensical claims remains.\nAnalysis of the MT dataset revealed that about a half of claim sentences contain the modal verb ‘should’, clearly indicating policy claims. Such statements also very explicitly express the stance on the controversial topic of interest.\nIn a similar vein, claims in persuasive students’ essays (PE) heavily rely on phrases signaling beliefs or argumentative discourse connectors whose usage is recommended in textbooks on essay writing. Most claims are value/policy claims written in the present tense.\nThe mixture of genres in the Araucaria cor-\n2The supplementary material to this submission contains textual examples illustrating the analysis presented here.\npus (VG) is reflected in the variety of claims. While some are simple statements starting with a discourse marker, there are many legal-specific claims requiring expert knowledge, reported and direct speech claims, and several nonsensical claims which undercuts the consistency of this dataset.\nThe web-discourse (WD) claims take a clear stance to the relevant controversy, yet sometimes anaphoric, however the usage of discourse markers is seldom. Habernal and Gurevych (2017) investigated hedging in claims and found out that it varies with respect to the topic being discussed (10% up to 35% of claims are hedged). Sarcasm or rhetorical question are also common.\nThese observations make clear that annotating claims—the central part of all arguments, as claimed by the majority of argumentation scholars—can be approached very differently when it comes to actual empirical, data-driven operationalization. While some common traits are shared, such as that claims usually need some support to make up a ‘full’ argument (e.g., premises, evidence, or justifications), the exact definition of a claim can be arbitrary—depending on the domain, register, or task."

      "heading" : "4 Methodology",
      "text" : "Given the results from the qualitative analysis, we want to investigate whether the different conceptualizations of claims can be assessed empirically and if so, how they could be dealt with in practice. Put simply, the task we are trying to solve in the following is: given a sentence, classify whether or not it contains a claim. We opted to model the claim identification task on sentence level, as this is the only way to make all datasets compatible to each other. Different datasets model claim boundaries differently, e.g. MT includes discourse markers with the same sentence, whereas they are excluded in PE.\nAll six datasets described in the previous sec-\ntion have been preprocessed by first segmenting documents into sentences using Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) and then annotating every sentence as claim, if one or more tokens within the sentence were labeled as claim (or major claim in PE). Analogously, each sentence is annotated as non-claim, if none of its tokens were labeled as claim (or major claim). Although our basic units of interest are sentences, we keep the content of the entire document to be able to retrieve information about the context of (non-)claims.3\nWe are not interested in optimizing the properties of a certain learner for this task, but rather want to compare the influence of different types of lexical, syntactical, and other kinds of information across datasets.4 Thus, we used a limited set of learners for our task: a) a standard L2-regularized logistic regression approach with manually defined feature sets5, and b) several deep learning approaches, using state-of-the-art neural network architectures. Regularized logistic regression is a simple yet robust and established technique for many text classification problems (Plank et al., 2014; He et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016a; Ferreira and Vlachos, 2016).\nThe in-domain experiments were carried out in a 10-fold cross-validation fashion with fixed splits into training and test data. As for the crossdomain experiments, we train on the entire data of the source domain and test on the entire data of the target domain. In the domain adaptation terminology, this corresponds to an unsupervised setting.\nTo address class-imbalance in our datasets (see Table 1), we downsample the negative class (nonclaim) both in-domain and cross-domain, so that positive and negative class occur approximately in\n3This is true only for the feature-based learners.

Since this means that we discard a lot of useful information (many negative instances), we repeat this procedure 20 times, in each case randomly discarding instances of the negative class such that the required ratio is obtained. At test time, we use the majority prediction of this ensemble of 20 trained models. With the exception of very few cases, this led to consistent performance improvements across all experiments. The systems are described in more detail in the following subsections. Additionally, we report the results of two baselines. The majority baseline labels all sentences as non-claims (predominant class in all datasets), the random baseline labels sentences as claims with 0.5 probability."

We train each of the three neural networks for 15 iterations and, for regularization, choose in each case the learned model that performs best on a heldout development set of roughly 10% of the training data as the model to apply to unseen test data.

Table 3 lists the results of the best feature-based (LR All features) and deep learning (CNN-rand) systems, as well as single feature groups (averages over all domains). We note the biggest performance drops on the datasets which performed best in the indomain setting (MT and PE). For the lowest scoring datasets, OC andWTP, the differences are only marginal when trained on a suitable dataset (VG and OC, respectively). The best feature-based approach outperforms the best deep learning approach in most scenarios.

Depending on the goal that should be achieved, training on VG (highest average Macro-F1) or OC (highest average Claim-F1) seems to be the best choice when the domain of test data is unknown.

      "heading" : "6 Cross-Domain Claim Identification",
      "text" : "To better understand which factors influence cross-domain performance of the systems we tested, we considered the following variables as potential determinants of outcome: similarity between source and target domain, the source domain itself, training data size, and the ratio between claims and non-claims.\nWe calculated the Spearman correlation of the top-500 lemmas between the datasets in each direction, see results in Table 4. The most similar\ndomains are OC (source s) and WTP (target t), coming from the same authors. OC (s) and WD (t) as well OC (s) and VG (t) are also highly correlated. For a statistical test of potential correlations between cross-domain performances and the introduced variables, we regress the cross-domain results (Table 3) on Table 4 (T4 in the following equation), on the number of claims #C (directly related to training data size in our experiments, effect of downsampling), and on the ratio of claims to non-claims R.8 More precisely, given source/training data and target data pairs (s, t) in Table 3, we estimate the linear regression model\nyst = α ·T4st +β · log(#Cs)+ γ ·Rt + εst, (1)\nwhere yst denotes the F1 score when training on s and testing on t. In the regression, we also include binary dummy variables 1σ = 1s,σ for each domain σ whose value is 1 if s = σ (and 0 otherwise). These help us identify “good” source domains.\n8Overall, we had 15 different systems, see upper 15 cells in Table 2. Therefore, we had 15 different regression models.\nThe coefficient α for Table 4 is not statistically significantly different from zero in any case. Ultimately, this means that it is difficult to predict cross-domain performance from lexical similarity of the datasets. This is in contrast to e.g., POS tagging, where lexical similarity has been reported to predict cross-domain performance very well (Van Asch and Daelemans, 2010). The coefficient for training data size β is statistically significantly different from zero in three out of 15 cases. In particular, it is significantly positive in two (CNN-rand, CNN-w2vec) out of four cases for the neural networks. This indicates that the neural networks would have particularly benefited from more training data, which is confirmed by the improved performance of the neural networks in the mixed sources experiments (cf. §5.2). The ratio of claims to non-claims in t is among the best predictors for the variables considered here (coefficient γ is significant in three out of 15 cases, but consistently positive). This is probably due to our decision to balance training data (downsampling non-claims) to keep the assessment of claim identification realistic for real-world applications, where the class ratio of t is unknown. Our systems are thus inherently biased towards a higher claim ratio.\nFinally, the dummy variables for OC and VG are three times significantly positive, but consistently positive overall. Their average coefficient is 2.31 and 1.90, respectively, while the average coefficients for all other source datasets is negative, and not significant in most cases. Thus, even when controlling for all other factors such as training data size and the different claim ratios of target domains, OC and VG are the best source domains for cross-domain claim classification in our experiments. OC and VG are particularly good training sources for the detection of claims (as opposed to non-claims)—the minority class in all datasets— as indicated by the average Claim-F1 scores in Table 3.\nOne finding that was confirmed both in-domain as well as cross-domain was the importance of lexical features as compared to other feature groups. As mere lexical similarity between domains does not explain performance (cf. coefficient α above), this finding indicated that the learners relied on a few, but important lexical clues. To go more into depth, we carried out error analysis on the CNNrand cross-domain results. We used OC, VG and\nPE as source domains, and MT and WTP as target domains. By examining examples in which a model trained on OC and VG made correct predictions as opposed to a model trained on PE, we quickly noticed that lexical indicators indeed played a crucial role. In particular, the occurrence of the word “should” (and to a lower degree: “would”, “article”, “one”) are helpful for the detection of claims across various datasets. In MT, a simple baseline labeling every sentence containing “should” as claim achieves 76.1 Macro-F1 (just slightly below the best in-domain system on this dataset). In the other datasets, this phenomenon is far less dominant, but still observable. We conclude that a few rather simple rules (learned by models trained on OC and VG, but not by potentially more complex models trained on PE) make a big difference in the cross-domain setting."

      "text" : "In a rigorous empirical assessment of different machine learning systems, we compared how six datasets model claims as the fundamental component of an argument. The varying performance of the tested in-domain systems reflects different notions of claims also observed in a qualitative study of claims across the domains. Our results reveal that the best in-domain system is not necessarily the best system in environments where the test domain is unknown. Particularly, we found that two rather noisy datasets (OC and VG) were the best candidates as source domains in the cross-domain setup. The reason for this seem to be a few important lexical indicators (like the word “should”) which are learned easier in those domains. In summary, as for the six datasets we investigated here, our analysis shows that the essence of a claim is not much more than a few lexical clues.\nFrom this, we conclude that future work should address the problem of fuzzy conceptualization of claim. A more consistent notion of claim as the central component of an argument, which also holds across domains, would potentially not just benefit cross-domain claim identification, but also higher-level applications relying on argumentation mining (Wachsmuth et al., 2017). To further overcome the problem of domain dependence, multitask learning (Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016) is a framework that could be explored in the argumentation mining context (Eger et al., 2017)."

      "text" : "This part of the supplementary material describes the hand-crafted features we used in more detail.\nStructure Features: Structure features capture the position, the length and the punctuation of a sentence. First, we define two binary features which indicate if the current sentence is the first or last sentence in the paragraph in which it is contained. These feature are motivated by the findings of Stab and Gurevych (2016) who found that structural properties of argument components are effective for distinguishing the argumentative function of argument components. In addition, Peldszus and Stede (2016) found that 43% of claims appear in the first sentence. Second, we add the number of tokens of the sentence to our feature set which proved to be indicative for identifying argumentatively relevant sentences (Biran and Rambow, 2011a; Moens et al., 2007). Finally, we adopted the punctuation features from Mochales-Palau and Moens (2009).\nLexical Features: As lexical features, we employ lowercased unigrams. We assume that these features are helpful for detecting claims since they capture discourse connectors like “therefore”, “thus”, or “hence” which frequently signal the presence of claims. We consider the most frequent 4,000 unigrams as binary features.\nSyntactic Features: To account for grammatical information at the sentence level, we include information about the part-of-speech and parse tree for each sentence. Following Stab and Gurevych (2016), we add binary POS n-grams (the 2000 most frequent, 2 ≤ n ≤ 4) and constituent parse tree production rules (4000 most frequent, minimum occurrence 5) as originally suggested by Lin et al. (2009). Additionally, to account for the frequency of POS tags, we include a feature which counts the occurrence of each part-of-speech per sentence.\nDiscourse Features: Cabrio et al. (2013) suggested that the relation between parts of discourse (e.g. connectives such as “because”) can be helpful to determine argumentative content. As this finding is affirmed by Stab and Gurevych (2016),\nwe include discourse features with the help of the Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) styled end-toend discourse parser as presented by Lin et al. (2014). We include discourse relations extracted from the parser output as a triple of i) the type of relation, ii) whether the relation is implicit or explicit, and iii) whether the current sentence is part of the first or the second discourse argument (or both).\nEmbedding Features: We represent each sentence as a summation of its word embeddings (Guo et al., 2014). These simple yet powerful latent semantic representation features have been found predictive in related work (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015, 2017). In particular, we use pretrained 300 dimensional GoogleNews word embeddings.9\nWe further experimented with sentiment features (Habernal and Gurevych, 2015; Anand et al., 2011) and dictionary features (Misra et al., 2015; Rosenthal and McKeown, 2015) but these delivered very poor results and are not reported in this article.\nQualitative analysis of claims: Examples\nThis part of the supplementary material contains exemplary claims from each of the datasets we experimented with, to illustrate the obversations described in Section 3.2 of the main paper."

It typically includes the identification of argumentative components, e.g. claims, as the central component of an argument. We perform a qualitative analysis across six different datasets and show that these appear to conceptualize claims quite differently. To learn about the consequences of such different conceptualizations of claim for practical applications, we carried out extensive experiments using state-of-the-art featurerich and deep learning systems, to identify claims in a cross-domain fashion. While the divergent perception of claims in different datasets is indeed harmful to crossdomain classification, we show that there are shared properties on the lexical level as well as system configurations that can help to overcome these gaps.",
