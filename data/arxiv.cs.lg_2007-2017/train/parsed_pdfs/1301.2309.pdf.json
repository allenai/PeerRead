    "abstractText" : "Collaborative filtering is the process of mak­ ing recommendations regarding the potential preference of a user, for example shopping on the Internet, based on the preference ratings of the user and a number of other users for various items. This paper considers collabo­ rative filtering bMed on explicit multi-valued ratings. To evaluate the algorithms, we con­ sider only pure collaborative filtering, using ratings exclusively, and no other information about the people or items. Our approach is to predict a user's prefer­ ences regarding a particular item by using other people who rated that item and other items rated by the user as noisy sensors. The noisy sensor model uses Bayes' theorem to compute the probability distribution for the user's rating of a new item. We give two variant models: in one, we learn a classical normal linear regression model of how users rate items; in another, we assume different users rate items the same, but the accuracy of the sensors needs to be learned. We com­ pare these variant models with state-of-the­ art techniques and show how they are sig­ nificantly better, whether a user has rated only two items or many. We report empir­ ical results using the EachMovie database 1 of movie ratings. We also show that by con­ sidering items similarity along with the users similarity, the accuracy of the prediction in­ creases.",
