      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The rise of various discussion forums and social media websites has given people a lot of avenues to express their opinions. As multiple people join a particular discussion, participants often agree or disagree with views presented by others. Mining the agreement and disagreement (denoted (dis)agreement) signals helps detect presence of disputes, ideological stance of the participants [1] and unravel beliefs shaping the opinion in general. This can further be useful for detecting subgroups [2] [3], analyzing how well a new product is being received or analyzing the mood to predict the trends on stock markets [4].\nIn this work, we explore a Siamese [5] inspired deep neural network to detect the presence of (dis)agreement in online discussions between two posts, the quote and the response (Q-R pairs [6]). In this framework, the same neural network encoder is applied to two input sentences individually, so that both of the two sentences are encoded into sentence vectors in the same embedding space. Prior work in this problem primarily focused on using handcrafted features to exploit the meta thread structure. We show that by training on a sufficiently large dataset (ABCD) we can bypass the need for designing handcrafted features. Thus, the classifier can be used for (dis)agreement detection between any two posts, even when the underlying hierarchical relationship between the Q-R pairs isn’t available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate detection of (dis)agreement using sentence based encoding.\n∗ These authors contributed equally to this work\nWe detect (dis)agreement by performing a 3-way classification (agreement/disagreement/none) between the Q-R pairs on several existing annotated datasets. Due to the lack of a standard dataset, some prior work focused primarily on 2-way classification (agreement/disagreement).\nIn the following sections, we first discuss related work. Section 3 describes the datasets used for evaluation. Section 4 describes the various features used in the classifier. In section 5, we explain the model architecture. Section 6 details the experiments performed and their corresponding results. Section 7 performs error analysis on the results from the proposed system. Finally, we conclude in section 8 and suggest relevant future work."

      "text" : "Previous work in this field focused a lot on spoken dialogues. [7], [8], [9] used spurt level agreement annotations from the ICSI corpus [10]. [11] presents detection of agreements in multi-party conversations using the AMI meeting corpus [12]. [13] presents a conditional random field based approach for detecting agreement/disagreement between speakers in English broadcast conversations\nRecently, researchers have turned their attention towards (dis)agreement detection in online discussions. The prior work was geared towards performing 2-way classification of agreement/disagreement. [14] used various sentiment, emotional and durational features to detect local and global (dis)agreement in discussion forums. [15] performed (dis)agreement on annotated posts from the Internet Argument Corpus (IAC) [6]. They investigated various manual labelled features, which are however difficult to reproduce as they are not annotated in other datasets. To benchmark the results, we’ve also incorporated the IAC corpus in our experiments. Quite recently, [16] proposed a 3-way classification by exploiting meta-thread structures and accommodation between participants. They also proposed a naturally occurring dataset ABCD (Agreement by Create Debaters) which was about 25 times larger than prior existing corpus. We’ve trained our classifier on this larger dataset. [17] proposed (dis)agreement detection with an isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model. [18] proposed features motivated by theoretical predictions to perform (dis)agreement detection. However, they’ve used hand-crafted patterns as features and these features miss\n978-1-5386-0680-3/17/$31.00 c©2017 IEEE\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n05 58\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 A\nug 2\n01 7\nfew real world scenarios reducing the performance of the classifier.\n(Dis)agreement detection is related to other similar NLP tasks like stance detection and argument mining but is not exactly the same. Stance detection is the task of identifying whether the author of the text is in favor or against or neutral towards a target, while argument mining focuses on tasks like automatic extraction of arguments from free text, argument proposition classification and argumentative parsing [19] [20]. Recently there are studies on how people back up their stances when arguing where comments are classified as either attacking or supporting a set of pre-defined arguments [21]. These tasks (stance detection, argument mining) are not independent but have some common features because of which they are benefited by common building blocks like sentiment detection, textual entailment and sentence similarity [21] [22]."

Although the website can support open ended as well as multiple sided debates, the corpus comprises only of the for-against debates. The corpus is annotated as follows: the side label corresponding to each post (response) determines whether the user agrees or disagrees with the previous post (quote). If the authors of both the posts are different, then they agree if the side labels are same or otherwise disagree. If the authors of both the posts is same, it is labeled as none as it implies that it is in continuation of the previous post. Also, the first post in a debate is usually setting up the premise of the debate, so it doesn’t have a side attached to it. Hence all the Q-R pairs with the quote as the first post are labeled as none. Table 1 shows example Q-R pairs for each label type."

The 4forum posts were annotated using Mechanical Turk. The annotators were provided with a Q-R pair and they indicated the level of (dis)agreement on a scale of [-5, 5]. However, not all posts in a thread were annotated for (dis)agreement and roughly 6000 valid Q-R pairs were extracted. In accordance with prior work of this corpus [15], [16], [18], we converted the scalar values into corresponding (dis)agreement as follows: [-5, -1] is tagged as disagreement, [-1, 1] is tagged as none, [1, 5] is tagged as agreement. In case multiple annotators have tagged the same post, we combine them as follows. None annotations are ignored unless there are no other (dis)agreement tags. In all other cases, average annotation score is used as the final score of the post."

Making use of these affect lexicons will help us in classifying if a response (dis)agrees with quote or not. Prior work [14] using these lexicons have shown them to give good results. Among lexical features we used the following.\nAFINN [30] word list are manually rated for valence with an integer between -5 (Negative Sentiment) and +5 (Positive Sentiment). Bing Liu [31] opinion lexicon extract opinion on customer reviews. +/-EffectWordNet [32] by MPQA group are sense level lexicons. The NRC Affect Intensity [33] lexicons provide real valued affect intensity. NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon [34] contains 8 sense level associations (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and 2 sentiment level associations (negative and positive). Expanded NRC WordEmotion Association Lexicon [35] expands the NRC wordemotion association lexicon for twitter specific language. NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon [36] contains emotion word associations computed on emotion labeled twitter corpus via Hashtags. NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and Sentiment140 Lexicon [37] contains sentiment word associations computed on twitter corpus via Hashtags and Emoticons. SentiWordNet [38] assigns to each synset of WordNet three sentiment scores: positivity, negativity, objectivity. Negation lexicons collections are used to count the total occurrence of negative words. The Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) [39] categorizes the words we use in everyday language to reveal our thoughts, feelings, personality, and motivations.\nFor each word in the sentence we calculate various metrics using these lexicons like number of negation words in a sentence, average negative and positive sentiment of the sentence etc. and use these as lexical feature vector to the system. The lexicon feature extractor was inspired from [40]."

A lot of NLP tasks like natural language inference,\ntextual entailment, answer selection, paraphrase identification etc involve modelling a pair of sentences so that they perform well on a particular task or multitude of such tasks [41]. For this task we used an architecture which is inspired by Siamese network [5] and Stanford Natural Language Inference model [42] with identical networks encoding Q-R pair.\nFor each Q-R pair we extract two sets of features. First, GloVe word embeddings are fed to Gated Recurrent Units [43] to create a sentence embedding. Second, from each text a lexical feature vector is extracted as mentioned in subsection 4.2. Both these sentence embeddings from Q-R pairs are concatenated and then fed into fully connected layers to do 3 way classification. Figure 1 show the architecture of our model."

The average sequence length of quotes and responses is 46.28 and 64.935 respectively. The Impact of maximum sequence length of the text input to GRUs is computed and can be found in section 6.

As is evident and hypothesized, the model trained with lexical and word embeddings gave the best results. It is interesting to see that using just the lexicons, the model beat the previous best model which signifies the importance of lexical features. However, using only lexicons as features will suffer from all the disadvantages of any bag-of-words model. This is primarily because it cannot encode the temporal nature of language. This is where gated recurrent units or in general recurrent neural networks come into play. GRU’s can successfully encode the temporal nature. Thus, by fusing both the GRU encoded embeddings and the lexicons, we achieved the state of the art results on the ABCD dataset by beating the previous best model’s [16] average F1 score with margin of 4% percentage. Table 3 compares variants of the proposed system with the existing state of the art."

Since we are dealing with discussion posts, the average post size is larger than a few sentences. Hence, as we increase the maximum sequence length, the increase\nin performance is justified. However, once we increase the size after a certain threshold, a lot of the input sequences need to be padded with zeroes, thus causing a drop in performance."

Here we’ve applied transfer learning technique to smaller datasets and achieved competitive results. Table 5 and 6 enlist the results of various model architectures explored for testing the effectiveness of transferring learning from ABCD dataset to the smaller annotated datasets IAC and AWTP. The variants explored are as follows. Direct, where the model trained on ABCD model (referred as pretrained model) is tested directly on the smaller dataset. Tuning: the model is seeded with the weights from the pretrained model and trained with the smaller dataset. Transfer: The last 2 layers from the pre-trained model are stripped and replaced with new dense layers of size 100 and 50 and the model is trained on the smaller dataset. Re-train last 2/3 layers: All but last-2/3 layers of the pre-trained model are frozen and the remaining layers are trained on the smaller dataset."

We’ve shown that by using this model, we no longer need to rely on hand-crafted features to exploit the meta-thread structure. We’ve also shown the benefit of transfer learning from pre-trained model on large corpora to achieve competitive results on small domain datasets. Till date, the research for (dis)agreement classification has not moved at the pace comparable to some other NLP tasks primarily because of unavailability of large standard dataset. Although ABCD dataset is large enough it suffers from many issues as it uses naturally occuring labels. We plan to enhance the ABCD dataset by performing semi-supervised tagging of labels by training models on hand-annotated\ndatasets. With the availability of a large standard dataset for (dis)agreement classification, we can try various recent advanced state of the art architectures for modelling sentences pairs [41], [49] to further improve the performance."

In this work we show that by using a Siamese inspired architecture to encode the discussions, we no longer need to rely on hand-crafted features to exploit the meta thread structure. We evaluate our model on existing online discussion corpora ABCD, IAC and AWTP. Experimental results on ABCD dataset show that by fusing lexical and word embedding features, our model achieves the state of the art performance of 0.804 average F1 score. We also show that the model trained on ABCD dataset performs competitively on relatively smaller annotated datasets (IAC and",
