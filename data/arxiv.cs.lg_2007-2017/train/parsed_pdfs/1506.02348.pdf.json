In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting – maximum likelihood estimation. Provided certain conditions hold on the model class, we provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. The conditions we require are fairly general, and cover the widely popular class of Generalized Linear Models, which in turn, include models for binary and multi-class classification, regression, and conditional random fields.\nWe provide an upper bound on the label requirement of our algorithm, and a lower bound that matches it up to lower order terms. Our analysis shows that unlike binary classification in the realizable case, just a single extra round of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal performance in maximum likelihood estimation.

      "text" : "In active learning, we are given a sample space X , a label space Y, a class of models that map X to Y, and a large set U of unlabelled samples. The goal of the learner is to learn a model in the class with small target error while interactively querying the labels of as few of the unlabelled samples as possible.\nMost theoretical work on active learning has focussed on the PAC or the agnostic PAC model, where the goal is to learn binary classifiers that belong to a particular hypothesis class [2, 13, 9, 6, 3, 4, 22], and there has been only a handful of exceptions [19, 8, 20]. In this paper, we shift our attention to a more general setting – maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), where Pr(Y |X) is described by a model θ belonging to a model class Θ. We show that when data is generated by a model in this class, we can do active learning provided the model class Θ has the following simple property: the Fisher information matrix for any model θ ∈ Θ at any (x, y) depends only on x and θ. This condition is satisfied in a number of widely applicable model classes, such as Linear Regression and Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), which in turn includes models for Multiclass Classification and Conditional\nRandom Fields. Consequently, we can provide active learning algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation in all these model classes.\nThe standard solution to active MLE estimation in the statistics literature is to select samples for label query by optimizing a class of summary statistics of the asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator [5]. The literature, however, does not provide any guidance towards which summary statistic should be used, or any analysis of the solution quality when a finite number of labels or samples are available. There has also been some recent work in the machine learning community [11, 12, 19] on this problem; but these works focus on simple special cases (such as linear regression [19, 11] or logistic regression [12]), and only [19] involves a consistency and finite sample analysis.\nIn this work, we consider the problem in its full generality, with the goal of minimizing the expected log-likelihood error over the unlabelled data. We provide a two-stage active learning algorithm for this problem. In the first stage, our algorithm queries the labels of a small number of random samples from the data distribution in order to construct a crude estimate θ1 of the optimal parameter θ∗. In the second stage, we select a set of samples for label query by optimizing a summary statistic of the covariance matrix of the estimator at θ1; however, unlike the experimental design work, our choice of statistic is directly motivated by our goal of minimizing the expected log-likelihood error, which guides us towards the right objective.\nWe provide a finite sample analysis of our algorithm when some regularity conditions hold and when the negative log likelihood function is convex. Our analysis is still fairly general, and applies to Generalized Linear Models, for example. We match our upper bound with a corresponding lower bound, which shows that the convergence rate of our algorithm is optimal (except for lower order terms); the finite sample convergence rate of any algorithm that uses (perhaps multiple rounds of) sample selection and maximum likelihood estimation is either the same or higher than that of our algorithm. This implies that unlike what is observed in learning binary classifiers, a single round of interaction is sufficient to achieve near-optimal log likelihood error for ML estimation."

      "text" : "Previous theoretical work on active learning has focussed on learning a classifier belonging to a hypothesis class H in the PAC model. Both the realizable and non-realizable cases have been considered. In the realizable case, a line of work [6, 18] has looked at a generalization of binary search; while their algorithms enjoy low label complexity, this style of algorithms is inconsistent in the presence of noise. The two main styles of algorithms for the non-realizable case are disagreementbased active learning [2, 9, 4], and margin or confidence-based active learning [3, 22]. While active learning in the realizable case has been shown to achieve an exponential improvement in label complexity over passive learning [2, 6, 13], in the agnostic case, the gains are more modest (sometimes a constant factor) [13, 9, 7]. Moreover, lower bounds [14] show that the label requirement of any agnostic active learning algorithm is always at least Ω(ν2/ǫ2), where ν is the error of the best hypothesis in the class, and ǫ is the target error. In contrast, our setting is much more general than binary classification, and includes regression, multi-class classification and certain kinds of conditional random fields that are not covered by previous work.\n[19] provides an active learning algorithm for linear regression problem under model mismatch. Their algorithm attempts to learn the location of the mismatch by fitting increasingly refined partitions of the domain, and then uses this information to reweight the examples. If the partition is highly refined, then the computational complexity of the resulting algorithm may be exponential in the dimension of the data domain. In contrast, our algorithm applies to a more general setting, and while we do not address model mismatch, our algorithm has polynomial time complexity. [1] provides an active learning algorithm for Generalized Linear Models in an online selective sampling setting; however, unlike ours, their input is a stream of unlabelled examples, and at each step, they need to decide whether the label of the current example should be queried.\nOur work is also related to the classical statistical work on optimal experiment design, which\nmostly considers maximum likelihood estimation [5]. For uni-variate estimation, they suggest selecting samples to maximize the Fisher information which corresponds to minimizing the variance of the regression coefficient. When θ is multi-variate, the Fisher information is a matrix; in this case, there are multiple notions of optimal design which correspond to maximizing different parameters of the Fisher information matrix. For example, D-optimality maximizes the determinant, and A-optimality maximizes the trace of the Fisher information. In contrast with this work, we directly optimize the expected log-likelihood over the unlabelled data which guides us to the appropriate objective function; moreover, we provide consistency and finite sample guarantees.\nFinally, on the empirical side, [12] and [11] derive algorithms similar to ours for logistic and linear regression based on projected gradient descent. Notably, these works provide promising empirical evidence for this approach to active learning; however, no consistency guarantees or convergence rates are provided (the rates presented in these works are not stated in terms of the sample size). In contrast, our algorithm applies more generally, and we provide consistency guarantees and convergence rates. Moreover, unlike [12], our logistic regression algorithm uses a single extra round of interaction, and our results illustrate that a single round is sufficient to achieve a convergence rate that is optimal except for lower order terms."

To ensure good performance, Γ should be chosen carefully, and our choice of Γ is motivated by Lemma 1. Suppose the labels yi are generated according to: yi ∼ p(y|xi, θ∗). Lemma 1 states that the expected loglikelihood error of the ML estimate with respect to m samples from Γ in this case is essentially Tr ( IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) ) /m.\nThis suggests selecting Γ as the distribution Γ∗ that minimizes Tr ( IΓ∗(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) ) . Unfortunately, we cannot do this as θ∗ is unknown. We resolve this problem through a two stage algorithm; in the first stage, we use a small number m1 of samples to construct a coarse estimate θ1 of θ\n∗ (Steps 1-2). In the second stage, we calculate a distribution Γ1 which minimizes Tr ( IΓ1(θ1) −1IU (θ1) ) and draw samples from (a slight modification of) this distribution for a finer estimation of θ∗ (Steps 3-5). The distribution Γ1 is modified slightly to Γ̄ (in Step 4) to ensure that IΓ̄(θ\n∗) is well conditioned with respect to IU (θ\n∗). The algorithm is formally presented in Algorithm 1. Finally, note that Steps 1-2 are necessary because IU and IΓ are functions of θ. In certain special cases such as linear regression, IU and IΓ are independent of θ. In those cases, Steps 1-2 are unnecessary, and we may skip directly to Step 3."

The proof of the following theorem and all the supporting lemmas will be presented in Appendix A.\nTheorem 1. Suppose the regularity conditions in Assumptions 1 and 2 hold.

      "text" : "Several remarks about Theorem 1 are in order. The high probability bound in Theorem 1 is with respect to the samples drawn in S1; provided these samples are representative (which happens with probability ≥ 1 − δ), the output θ2 of Algorithm 1 will satisfy (1). Additionally, Theorem 1 assumes that the labels are sampled with replacement; in other words, we can query the label of a point xi multiple times. Removing this assumption is an avenue for future work.\nSecond, the highest order term in both (1) and (2) is Tr ( IΓ∗(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) ) /m. The terms\ninvolving ǫm2 and ǫ̃m2 are lower order as both ǫm2 and ǫ̃m2 are o(1). Moreover, if β = ω(1), then the term involving β in (1) is of a lower order as well. Observe that β also measures the tradeoff between m1 and m2, and as long as β = o( √ m2), m1 is also of a lower order than m2. Thus, provided β is ω(1) and o( √ m2), the convergence rate of our algorithm is optimal except for lower order terms.\nFinally, the lower bound (2) applies to distributions Γ for which IΓ(θ ∗) ≥ cIU (θ∗), where c occurs in the lower order terms of the bound. This constraint is not very restrictive, and does not affect the asymptotic rate. Observe that IU (θ\n∗) is full rank. If IΓ(θ∗) is not full rank, then the expected log likelihood error of the ML estimate with respect to Γ will not be consistent, and thus such a Γ will never achieve the optimal rate. If IΓ(θ\n∗) is full rank, then there always exists a c for which IΓ(θ\n∗) ≥ cIU (θ∗). Thus (2) essentially states that for distributions Γ where IΓ(θ∗) is close to being rank-deficient, the asymptotic convergence rate of O(Tr ( IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) ) /m2) is achieved at larger values of m2."

In this case, x ∈ Rd and Y ∈ R are generated according to the distribution: Y = θ⊤∗ X+η, where η is a noise variable drawn fromN (0, 1). In this case, the negative loglikelihood function is: L(y|x, θ) = (y − θ⊤x)2, and the corresponding Fisher information matrix I(x, θ) is given as: I(x, θ) = xx⊤. Observe that in this (very special) case, the Fisher information matrix does not depend on θ; as a result we can eliminate the first two steps of the algorithm, and proceed directly to step 3. If Σ = 1n ∑ i xixi\n⊤ is the covariance matrix of U , then Theorem 1 tells us that we need to query labels from a distribution Γ∗ with covariance matrix Λ such that Tr ( Λ−1Σ ) is minimized.\nWe illustrate the advantages of active learning through a simple example. Suppose U is the unlabelled distribution:\nxi = { e1 w.p. 1− d−1d2 , ej w.p. 1 d2 for j ∈ {2, · · · , d} ,\nwhere ej is the standard unit vector in the j th direction.

Our second example is logistic regression for binary classification. In this case, x ∈ Rd, Y ∈ {−1, 1} and the negative log-likelihood function is: L(y|x, θ) = log(1 + e−yθ⊤x), and the corresponding Fisher information I(x, θ) is given as: I(x, θ) = e θ⊤x\n(1+eθ⊤x)2 · xx⊤.\nFor illustration, suppose ‖θ∗‖2 and ‖x‖2 are bounded by a constant and the covariance matrix Σ is sandwiched between two multiples of identity in the PSD ordering i.e., cdI Σ Cd I for\nsome constants c and C. Then the regularity assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied for constant values of L1, L2, L3 and L4. In this case, Theorem 1 states that choosing m1 to be ω ( Tr ( IU (θ ∗)−1 )) = ω (d)\ngives us the optimal convergence rate of (1 + o(1)) Tr(IΓ∗ (θ∗)−1IU (θ∗))\nm2 .\nMultinomial Logistic Regression. Our third example is multinomial logistic regression for multi-class classification. In this case, Y ∈ 1, . . . ,K, x ∈ Rd, and the parameter matrix θ ∈ R (K−1)×d. The negative log-likelihood function is written as: L(y|x, θ) = −θ⊤y x+log(1+ ∑K−1 k=1 e θ⊤k x), if y 6= K, and L(y = k|x, θ) = log(1+∑K−1k=1 eθ ⊤\nk x) otherwise. The corresponding Fisher information matrix is a (K−1)d× (K−1)d matrix, which is obtained as follows. Let F be the (K−1)× (K−1) matrix with:\nFii = eθ\n⊤ i x(1 + ∑\nk 6=i e θ⊤k x)\n(1 + ∑\nk e θ⊤k x)2\n, Fij = − eθ\n⊤ i x+θ ⊤ j x\n(1 + ∑\nk e θ⊤k x)2\nThen, I(x, θ) = F ⊗ xx⊤.

A second open question is whether it is possible to remove the with replacement sampling assumption. A final question is what happens if IU (θ\n∗) has a high condition number. In this case, our algorithm will require a large number of samples in the first stage; an open question is whether we can use a more sophisticated procedure in the first stage to reduce the label requirement."

      "text" : "In order to prove Lemma 1, we use the following result which is a modification of [10]. In particular, the following lemma is a generalization of Theorem 5.1 from [10], and its proof (omitted here) follows from generalizing the proof of that theorem.\nLemma 4. Suppose ψ1, · · · , ψn : Rd → R are random functions drawn iid from a distribution. Let P = E [ψi] and Q : R d → R be another function. Let\nθ̂ = argminθ∈S ∑\ni\nψi(θ), and θ ∗ = argminθ∈SP (θ).\nAssume:\n1. (Convexity of ψ): Assume that ψ is convex (with probability one),\n2. (Smoothness of ψ): Assume that ψ is smooth in the following sense: the first, second and third derivatives exist at all interior points of S (with probability one),\n3. (Regularity conditions): Suppose\n(a) S is compact, (b) θ∗ is an interior point of S, (c) ∇2P (θ∗) is positive definite (and hence invertible), (d) ∇Q(θ∗) = 0, (e) There exists a neighborhood B of θ∗ and a constant L̃3 such that (with probability one),\n∇2ψ(θ) and ∇2Q(θ) are L̃3 Lipschitz, namely ∥∥∥ ( ∇2P (θ∗) )−1/2 (∇2ψ(θ)−∇2ψ(θ′) ) ( ∇2P (θ∗) )−1/2∥∥∥\n2 ≤ L̃3 ‖θ − θ′‖∇2P (θ∗) , and\n∥∥∥ ( ∇2Q(θ∗) )−1/2 (∇2Q(θ)−∇2Q(θ′) ) ( ∇2Q(θ∗) )−1/2∥∥∥\n2 ≤ L̃3 ‖θ − θ′‖∇2P (θ∗) ,\nfor θ, θ′ ∈ B, 4. (Concentration at θ∗) Suppose ‖∇ψ(θ∗)‖∇2P (θ∗)−1 ≤ L̃1 and\n∥∥∥ ( ∇2P (θ∗) )−1/2 ∇2ψ(θ∗) ( ∇2P (θ∗) )−1/2∥∥∥ 2 ≤ L̃2\nhold with probability one.\nChoose p ≥ 2 and define\nǫn def = c̃(L̃1L̃3 + √ L̃2) √ p log dn\nn ,\nwhere c̃ is an appropriately chosen constant. Let c̃′ be another appropriately chosen constant. If n is large enough so that √\np log dn n ≤ c̃′ min { 1√ L̃2 , 1 L̃1L̃3 , diameter(B) L̃1 } , then:\n(1− ǫn) τ2 n − L̃1\n2\nnp/2 ≤ E\n[ Q(θ̂)−Q(θ∗) ] ≤ (1 + ǫn) τ2\nn + maxθ∈S Q(θ)−Q(θ∗) np ,\nwhere\nτ2 def =\n1\nn2 Tr\n   ∑\ni,j\nE [ ∇ψi(θ∗)∇ψj(θ∗)⊤ ]  P (θ∗)−1Q(θ∗)P (θ∗)−1   .\nThe following lemma is a fundamental result relating the variance of the gradient of the log likelihood to Fisher information matrix for a large class of probability distributions [17].\nLemma 5. Suppose L satisfies the regularity conditionsin Assumptions 1 and 2. Then, for any example x, we have:\nEp(y|x,θ∗) [ ∇L(Y |x, θ∗)∇L(Y |x, θ∗)⊤ ] = ∇2Ix(θ∗).\nWe now prove Lemma 1.\n(Proof of Lemma 1). We first define\nψi(θ) = L (Y |X, θ) ,\nwhere X ∼ Γ and Y ∼ p(Y |X, θ∗) for i = 1, · · · ,m2 and Q(θ) def= LU (θ). Using the notation of Lemma 4, this means that\n∇2P (θ∗) = IΓ(θ∗) and ∇2Q(θ∗) = IU (θ∗).\nUsing the regularity conditions from Section 4 and the hypothesis that IΓ(θ ∗) cIU (θ∗), we see\nthat this satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 4 with constants\n(L̃1, L̃2, L̃3) = (L1/ √ c, L2/c, L3/c 3/2)\nWe now apply Lemma 4 to conclude that for large enough m2, we have:\n(1− ǫm2)τ2/m2 − L21\ncm p/2 2\n≤ E [ LU ( θ̂ ) − LU (θ∗) ] ≤ (1 + ǫm2)τ2/m2 + R\nmp2 ,\nwhere\nǫm2 = O (( L̃1L̃3 + √ L̃2 )√ p log dm2\nm2\n) = O ( 1\nc2\n( L1L3 + √ L2 )√p log dm2 m2 ) and\nτ2 def = Tr ( E [ ∇P̂ (θ∗)∇P̂ (θ∗)⊤ ] IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ ∗)IΓ(θ ∗)−1 ) = Tr ( IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ ∗) ) ,\nusing Lemma 5 in the last step.\nWe now prove Lemma 2.\n(Proof of Lemma 2). Define\nψi(θ) def = L (Y |X, θ) ,\nwhere X ∼ U and Y ∼ p(Y |X, θ∗) for i = 1, · · · ,m1 and Q(θ) def= ‖θ − θ∗‖22. Using the regularity conditions from Section 4, we see that this satisfies the hypothesis of Lemma 4 with constants\n(L̃1, L̃2, L̃3) = (L1, L2,max ( L3,\n1√ σmin\n) ))\nWe now apply Lemma 4 to conclude that\nE [ ‖θ1 − θ∗‖22 ] ≤ (1 + ǫm1)τ2/m1 + diameter(Θ)\nm21 ,\nwhere ǫm1 = O ( (L1 max ( L3, 1√ σmin ) + √ L2) √ log dm1 m1 ) , and\nτ2 def = Tr ( E [ ∇L̂U (θ∗)∇L̂U (θ∗) ⊤] IU (θ ∗)−2 ) = Tr ( IU (θ ∗)−1 ) ,\nusing Lemma 5 in the last step. By the choice of m1, we have that\nE [ ‖θ1 − θ∗‖22 ] ≤ 2τ2/m1.\nMarkov’s inequality then tells us that with probability at least 1− δ, we have:\n‖θ1 − θ∗‖22 ≤ 2τ2 δm1 ≤ 1 β2L24 .\nUsing Assumption 2 on point-wise self concordancy of I(x, θ) now finishes the proof.\n(Proof of Theorem 1). The proof is a careful combination of Lemmas 1, 2 and 3. Lower Bound: For any Γ that satisfies IΓ(θ ∗) cIU (θ∗), we can apply Lemma 1 to write:\nE [ LU ( θ̂Γ ) − LU (θ∗) ] ≥ (1− ǫm2)\nTr ( IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) )\nm2 − L\n2 1\ncm22 .\nThe lower bound follows. Upper Bound: We begin by showing that if Assumptions 1 and 2 are satisfied, then, from Lemma 2, we have that with probability ≥ 1− δ, it holds that:\nβ − 1 β I(x, θ∗) I(x, θ1) β + 1 β I(x, θ∗) ∀ x ∈ U\nwith probability ≥ 1− δ. This means that the following hold for distributions Γ1, Γ∗ and U :\nβ − 1 β IΓ1(θ ∗) IΓ1(θ1) β + 1 β IΓ1(θ ∗), (5) β − 1 β IΓ∗(θ ∗) IΓ∗(θ1) β + 1 β IΓ∗(θ ∗), and (6)\nβ − 1 β IU (θ ∗) IU (θ1) β + 1 β IU (θ ∗). (7)\nSince Γ = αΓ1+(1−α)U , we have that IΓ(θ∗) αIΓ1(θ∗) which further implies that IΓ(θ∗)−1 1 αIΓ1(θ ∗)−1. Similarly, since IΓ(θ ∗) (1 − α)IU (θ∗), we can apply Lemma 1 on Γ to get:\nE [LU (θ2)− LU (θ∗)] ≤ (1 + ǫ̂m2) Tr\n( IΓ(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) )\nm2 +\nR m22 ≤ 1 α (1 + ǫ̂m2)\nTr ( IΓ1(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) )\nm2 +\nR\nm22\n≤ (1 + ǫ̃m2) Tr\n( IΓ1(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) )\nm2 +\nR\nm22 ,\nwhere ǫ̂m2 , ǫ̃m2 = O ( 1 (1−α)2 ( L1L3 + √ L2 )√ log dm2\nm2\n) = O (( L1L3 + √ L2 ) √ log dm2\nm 1/6 2\n) .\nFrom (5) and (7), the right hand side is at most:\n(1 + ǫ̃m2)( β + 1 β − 1) 2Tr\n( IΓ1(θ1) −1IU (θ1) )\nm2 +\nR\nm22\nBy definition of Γ1, this is at most:\n(1 + ǫ̃m2)( β + 1 β − 1) 2Tr\n( IΓ∗(θ1) −1IU (θ1) )\nm2 +\nR\nm22\nFinally, applying (6) and (7), we get that this is at most:\n(1 + ǫ̃m2)( β + 1 β − 1) 4Tr\n( IΓ∗(θ ∗)−1IU (θ∗) )\nm2 +\nR\nm22\nThe upper bound follows."
