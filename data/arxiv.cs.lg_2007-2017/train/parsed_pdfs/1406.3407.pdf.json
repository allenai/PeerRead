      "text" : "Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) Hinton (2002) are a specific neural network with no hiddenhidden and visible-visible connections. They have attracted significant attention recently on many machine learning problems, such as dimension reduction Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006), text categorization Larochelle et al. (2012), collaborative filtering Salakhutdinov et al. (2007) and object recognition Krizhevsky et al. (2012). A recent survey Bengio et al. (2012) shows how to improve classification accuracy by exploiting prior knowledge about the world around us. The purpose of this paper is to answer whether we can leverage the hierarchical structure over categories to improve the classification accuracy. The hierarchical tree Fellbaum (1998); Weigend et al. (1999); Goodman (2001); Dekel et al. (2004) over different classes is an efficient and effective way for knowledge representation and categorization. The top level of the taxonomy hierarchies starts with a general or abstract description of common properties for all objects, while the low levers add more specific characteristics. In other words, the semantic relationship among classes is constructed from generalization to specification as depth increasing in the hierarchical tree or taxonomy. For example, WordNet Fellbaum (1998) and ImageNet Deng et al. (2009) use this semantic hierarchy to model human psycholinguistic knowledge and object taxonomy respectively. Unfortunately, traditional RBM Larochelle & Bengio (2008); Larochelle et al. (2012) treats the category structure as flat and little work has been done to explore the interclass relationship.\nIn this paper, we generalize RBM with hierarchical prior for classification problems. Basically, we divide the classification RBM into traditional RBM for representation learning and multinomial logit model for classification, see Fig. 1(a) for intuitive understanding. For the traditional RBM (red in Fig. 1(a)), we can extend it into deep belief network (DBN), while for the multinomial logit model (green in Fig. 1(a)), we can incorporate the interclass relationship to it. In this work, we focus on the hierarchical prior over the classification RBM, and we take a similar strategy as corrMNL, that means we use sums of parameters along paths from root to a specific leaf in the tree as model parameters for hierarchical classification. However, we consider it in a rather different way from the previous work. We can think our method is a kind of mixture of corrMNL Shahbaba & Neal (2007) and the orthogonal SVM model Xiao et al. (2011). However, our model inherits the advantage of\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n34 07\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 0\nA pr\n2 01\n5\nRBM, which can learn the hidden representation for better classification Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006); Larochelle et al. (2012), compared to the multinomial logit Shahbaba & Neal (2007) and hierarchical SVM Dekel et al. (2004); Xiao et al. (2011). Moreover, we only have a single RBM in our model, while there are multiple SVMs in the orthogonal hierarchical SVM Xiao et al. (2011).\nOur contributions are: (1) we introduce the hierarchical semantic prior over labels into restricted Boltzmann machine; (2) we add orthogonal constraints over adjacent layers in the hierarchy, which makes our model more robust for classification problems. We test our method in the experiments, and show comparative results over competitive baselines."

Assume that we have a training set D = {(xi, yi)}, comprising for the i-th pair: an input vector xi ∈ X and a target class yi ∈ Y , where xi ∈ Rd and yi ∈ {1, ...,K}. An RBM with n hidden units is a parametric model of the joint distribution between a layer of hidden variables h = (h1, ..., hn) and the observations x = (x1, ..., xd) and y.\nThe classification RBM was first proposed in Hinton (2007) and was further developed in Larochelle & Bengio (2008); Larochelle et al. (2012) with discriminative training model. The joint likelihood of the classification RBM takes the following form:\np(y,x,h) ∝ e−E(y,x,h) (1)\nwhere the energy function is\nE(y,x,h) = −hTWx− bTx− cTh− dTy − hTUy (2)\nwith parameters Θ = {W,b, c,d,U} and y = (1y=i)Ki=1 for K classes, where matrix W ∈ Rn×d, and U ∈ Rn×K . For classification problem, we need to compute the conditional probability for p(y|x). As shown in Salakhutdinov et al. (2007), this conditional distribution has explicit formula and can be calculated\nexactly, by writing it as follows: p(y|x) = edy ∏n j=1 ( 1 + ecj+Ujy+ ∑ iWijxi )∑ y∗ e dy∗ ∏n j=1 ( 1 + ecj+Ujy∗+ ∑ iWijxi\n) (3) To learn RBM parameters, we need to optimize the joint likelihood p(y,x) on training data D. Note that it is intractable to compute p(y,x), because it needs to model p(x). Fortunately, Hinton proposed an efficient stochastic descent method, namely contrastive divergence (CD) Hinton (2002) to maximize the joint likelihood. Thus, we get the following stochastic gradient updates for W and U from CD respectively\n∂logp(x, y)\n∂Wij = 〈vihj〉data − 〈vihj〉model\n∂logp(x, y)\n∂Ujk = 〈hjyk〉data − 〈hjyk〉model (4)\nAnd update Θ until convergence with gradient descent\nΘ = Θ + η ∂logp(x, y)\n∂Θ (5)\nwhere η is the learning rate for the classification RBM."

      "text" : "Our model introduces hierarchical prior over label sets for logistic regression classifier in the classification RBM. Note that we divide the classification RBM into two parts: RBM (feature learning) and multinomial logit model (classifier), corresponding to red and green regions shown in Fig. 1(a) respectively. Our model introduces the hierarchical prior over multinomial logit regression classifier, which is vital for classification problems under RBM framework.\nDefine the hierarchical tree T = (V, E), the number of node N = |V| and the number of edge M = |E|. Furthermore, we assume all parameters along edges are A = {A1, ..,Am}, where {Aj}mj=1 describes the parameter for each edge in the hierarchy respectively and Aj has the same size as U in the above subsection 2.1. For any node ν in the tree, we denoteA(ν) as its direct parent (vertex adjacent to v), and A(i)(ν) to be its i-th ancestor of ν. As in Dekel et al. (2004), we also define the path for each node ν ∈ T , define P (ν) to be the set of nodes along the path from root to v, P (ν) = {µ ∈ T : ∃i µ = A(i)(ν)} (6) Now we can define the coefficient parameters for each leaf node ν as\nA(ν) = ∑\nµ∈P (ν)\nAµ (7)\nwhere the classification coefficient for each class in Eq. (7) is decomposed into contributions along paths from root to the leaf associated to that class. For our model, each leaf node is associated to one class, which takes the same methodology as in Salakhutdinov et al. (2007). Fig. 1(b) is an example with total five classes, where the sums of parameters along the path to the leaf node are coefficient parameters used for classification. In Fig. 1(b), A12 and A13 are parameters along branches in the first level, and A21, A22, A31, A32 and A33 are parameters in the second level. For example, the coefficient parameter of class 1 is A12 + A21 according to Eq. (7); similarly, for class 4, its coefficient parameter is A13 + A32. For example, we can see class 1 and class 2 sharing the common term A12, which can be thought as the prior correlation between the parameters of nearby classes in the hierarchy.\nFor K classes, we have U ∈ Rn×K and Aj ∈ Rn×K for j = {1, ..,m}. Thus we can factorize\nU = VA (8)\nwhere A = {A1, ..,Am} ∈ Rmn×K is the concatenation of parameters {Aj}mj=1 of all edges in the hierarchy, while V ∈ Rn×mn implies the hierarchical prior over labels, refer Eq. (7) for construction of the correlated matrix V. Note that V (just) encodes the given hierarchical structures with 0 or 1 and is fixed during training the models. In addition, we introduce orthogonal restrictions\njust as in Xiao et al. (2011) to reduce redundancy between adjacent layers. Given a training set D = {(xi, yi)}, we propose the following objective function:\nL(D; Θ) = − |D|∑ i=1 logp(yi,xi) + C ∑ ν,µ∈P (ν) trace(ATµAν) (9)\nwhere C is the weight to balance the two terms. The first term is from the negative log likelihood as in RBM and the second term forces parameters at children to be orthogonal to those at its ancestor as much as possible.\nThe differences between our model and RBM lie: (1) hierarchical prior over labels, which can induce correlation between the parameters of nearby nodes in the tree; (2) we have orthogonal regularization which can make our model more robust, and also reduce redundancy in model parameters. For parameters updating, we have the same equations as in the classification RBM, except for U which introduces hierarchical prior and orthogonal restrictions among children-parent pairs.\nAccording to chain rule, we can differenciate L(D; Θ) r.w.t Aν and get the following derivative\n∂L(D; Θ) ∂Aν\n= − ∂ ∑|D| i=1 logp(yi,xi)\n∂U · ∂U ∂Aν\n+ C ∑\nµ∈P (ν)\nAµ (10)\nNote that the derivative of ∑|D| i=1 logp(yi,xi) w.r.t. U can be computed via Eq. (4). Thus, we can use Eq. (10) to calculate derivative w.r.t. Aν , and then update Aν with stochastic gradient descent. Given Aν , we can use Eq. (8) to update U."

      "heading" : "3 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS",
      "text" : "We analyze our model with experiments on two classification problems: character recognition and document classification, and compare our results to those from competitive baselines below. RBM or RBM for classification was first proposed in Hinton & Salakhutdinov (2006) and later was further developed in Larochelle et al. (2012). Its mathematical formula is shown in Eq. (2). Hierarchical classification RBM with soft assignment (HRBMs) is a nested hierarchical classifier in a top-down way, shown in Fig. 2(b). In the training stage, for each internal node (including root\nnode) in the current level, HRBM will split training data according to its children and learn a classification RBM for multiple classes (decided by the number of its children). In the inference stage, the likelihood for certain classes in the current layer depends both on the output probability of this layer classifier and also the conditional likelihood on the upper levels. For example, the probability to assign label 2 to a given instance in Fig. 2(b) depends on the output probabilities from RBM1, RBM21 and RBM31. For each data instance, its probability belongs to each class is the probability production along path from root to the leaf of that class, and finally we assign the data instance to the label with largest probability. Hierarchical classification RBM with hard assignment (HRBMh) has the similar hierarchical structure as HRBMs in Fig. 2(b). The difference between HRBMs and HRBMh is that HRBMs assign classification probability to each node, while HRBMh assign labels. Hidden hierarchical classification RBM (HHRBM) is similar as the hierarchical classification RBM (HRBM) in a top-down manner. For any current node, HHRBM learns a classification RBM and projects the training data into hidden space for its children (Note that RBM can map any input instance into its hidden space). Then, all its children recursively learn classification RBMs with projected hidden states as input from its parent node until to leaf level. In a sense, HHRBM works similar to the deep believe network (DBN) in Hinton (2007). Hence, the only difference between HHRBM and HRBM is that HRBM computes the classification probability with the visual data as input for all levels, while HHRBM calculates the classification probability with hidden states as input in a top-down manner. Multinomial logit model (MNL), a.k.a multiclass logistic regression, has no class correlated hierarchical structure. Correlated Multinomial logit regression (corrMNL) 1 extends MNL with hierarchical prior over classes, refer to Shahbaba & Neal (2007) for more details.\nIn all the above baselines, HRBMs, HRBMh, HHRBM and corrMNL leverage the hierarchical prior over label sets for classification, while RBM and MNL have no such prior information available. As for the difference in the number of RBMs used, (H)HRBMs belong to the tow-down classification approaches where multiple RBMs are constructed and each of which is trained to classify training\n1http://www.ics.uci.edu/˜babaks/Site/Codes.html\nexamples into one of its children in a hierarchical tree while our approach maintains only a single RBM.\nCharacter Recognition MNIST digits2 consists of 28× 28-size images of handwriting digits from 0 through 9, and has been widely used to test character recognition methods. In the experiment, we use Fig. 2(a) as our hierarchical prior over label sets. To test our method and other baselines, we sample 5000 images from the training sets as our training examples and 1000 examples from the testing sets as our testing data. The reason that we use a subset of MNIST is to answer whether the correlation between different classes is valuable for classification problem when the number of training examples for individual classes may be relatively small. In order to make our method comparable to other baselines, we have the same parameter setting for RBM related methods (including RBM, HRBMs, HRBMh and our method). We set the number of hidden states n = 100 and the learning rate η = 0.1 for RBM related methods, and the extra parameter in our model C = 0.1. Both HRBMs and HRBMh learn a RBM for each node and recursively to leafs, shown in Fig. 3. For the HHRBM with 4 layers decided by the hierarchical prior in Fig. 2(a), we set its number of hidden states 100, 50, 25 and 20 for each layer respectively.\nThe comparison between our method and the baselines is shown in Table (1). Our method incorporates the hierarchical prior structure over labels, and the experimental results show that our method outperform other RBM related methods, and also demonstrates that the hierarchical prior in our method is helpful to improve the recognition accuracy.\nTo further indicate whether our method is helpful or not with few training samples and how it performs on rare classes, we tested our model on the balanced and unbalanced cases. For the balanced case (each class was sampled equally), we random sampled from 1000 to 5000 examples respectively and tested on the 1000 samples from testing set. The results in Fig. 4(a) demonstrates that our model works better than RBM. We also tested our method on the rare classes. Basically, we sampled a few examples for each rare class, while keep the other classes with 500 samples respectively. For example, we sample the 10 examples for the class ‘0’, while the rest 9 classes have 500\n2http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\ntraining examples respectively. Then, we training our model with these samples, and test it on the test cases. Similarly, we did the same testing on classes ‘1’ to ‘9’ respectively. We tested our method for each rare class on the testing set, and show the over average error rate in Fig. 4(b), which clearly demonstrates that our method is much better than RBM on rare classes.\nDocument Classification We also evaluated our model on 20 news group dataset for document classification. The 20 news group dataset3 has 18,846 articles with with 61188 vocabularies, which has been widely used in text categorization and document classification. In the experiment, we tested our model on the version of the 20 news group dataset4, in order to make our results comparable to the current state of the art results. In the experiment, we used the hierarchical prior structure over label shown in Fig. 3 for HHRBM, HRBMh, HRBMs and our model. As for parameter setting, we use CD-1, and set the number of hidden states n = 2000, learning rate η = 0.1 and the maximum epoch equals to 100 for RBM related methods. For HHRBM, we set the number of hidden states to be 1000, 500, 200 and 200 respectively for each layer. As for our method, we set n = 1500, η = 0.01, C = 0.1 and maximum epoch 200.\nThe results of different methods are shown in Table (2). Once again, our model outperforms the other RBM models, also get better results than SVM and neural network classifiers. HRBMs and corrMNL have bad performance in this dataset. The reason we guess is that HRBMs calculates the classification probability for each class by multiplying the output probabilities along the path from root to the leaf associated to that class. Thus, HRBMs will prefer the high level class for unbalanced hierarchical structure. Note that the hierarchical tree in Fig. 3 is unbalanced structure. For HRBMs, ‘alt.Atheism’, ‘misc.forsale’ and ‘soc.religon.christian’ will have higher probability to be labeled compared to leafs (or classes) in the level 4. corrMNL may have the same problem as HRBMs. Another reason for the low performance is that corrMNL does not consider the parameter redundancy problem between adjacent layers as in our model.\nWe also evaluate how the regularization term influences the performance. We set C = 0 to remove the orthogonal restriction, and get accuracy 30.1% in Table (2), which is significant lower than the result with orthogonal restriction. Hence, it demonstrates that it is useful to introduce orthogonal restriction to the correlated hierarchical prior."

(2011); Rohit et al. (2013). Much work has extensively been done in the past years to exploit hierarchical prior over labels for classification problem, such as document categorization Koller & Sahami (1997); McCallum et al. (1998); Weigend et al. (1999); Dumais & Chen (2000); Cai & Hofmann (2004) and object recognition Marszalek & Schmid (2007). Two most popular approaches to leverage hierarchical prior can be categorized below. The first approach classifies each node recursively, by choosing the label of which the associated vector has the largest output score among its siblings till to a leaf node. An variant way is to compute the conditional probability for each class at each level, and then multiply these probabilities along every branch to compute the final assignment probability for each class. Xiao et al. introduced a hierarchical classification method with orthogonal transfer Xiao et al. (2011), which requires the parameters of children nodes are orthogonal to those of its parents as much as possible. Another example is the nested multinomial logit model Shahbaba & Neal (2007), in which the nested classification model for each node is statistically independent, conditioned on its parent in the upper levels. One weakness of this strategy for hierarchical classification is that errors will propagate from parents to children, if any misclassification happened in the top level. The other methodology for hierarchical classification prefers to use the sum of parameters along the tree for classifying cases ended at leaf nodes. Cai and Hoffmann Cai & Hofmann (2004) proposed a hierarchical larger margin multi-class SVM with tree-induced loss functions. Similarly, Dekel et al. in Dekel et al. (2004) improved Cai & Hofmann (2004) into an online version for hierarchical classification. Recently, Shahbaba et al. proposed a correlated multinomial logit model (corrMNL) Shahbaba & Neal (2007), whose regression coefficients for each leaf node are represented by the sum of parameters on all the branches leading to that class.\nApart from the two approaches mentioned above, there are also other methods proposed in the past. Dumais and Chen trained different classifiers kind of layer by layer by exploring the hierarchical structure Dumais & Chen (2000). Cesa-Bianchi et al. combined Bayesian inference with the probabilities output from SVM classifiers in Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2006) for hierarchical classification. Similarly, Gopal et al. Gopal et al. (2012) used Bayesian approach (with variational inference) with hierarchical prior for classification problems."

One weakness of this strategy for hierarchical classification is that errors will propagate from parents to children, if any misclassification happened in the top level. The other methodology for hierarchical classification prefers to use the sum of parameters along the tree for classifying cases ended at leaf nodes.

    "abstractText" : "Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) and its variants have been widely used on classification problems. In a sense, its success of RBM should be attributed to its strong representation power with hidden variables. Often, classification RBM ignores the interclass relationship or prior knowledge of sharing information among classes. In this paper, we propose a RBM with hierarchical prior for classification problem, by generalizing the classification RBM with sharing information among different classes. Basically, we assume the hierarchical prior over classes, where parameters for nearby nodes are correlated in the hierarchical tree, and further the parameters at each node of the tree to be orthogonal to those at its ancestors. Through the hierarchical prior, our model improves the information sharing between different classes and reduce the redundancy for robust classification. We test our method on several datasets, and show promising results compared to competitive baselines.",
