The methods have application to the decision-theoretic control of hard search and reasoning algorithms. We illustrate the ap­ proach with a focus on the task of predict­ ing run time for general and domain-specific solvers on a hard class of structured con­ straint satisfaction problems. We review the use of learned models to predict the ultimate length of a trial, based on observing the be­ havior of the search algorithm during an early phase of a problem session. Finally, we dis­ cuss how we can employ the models to inform dynamic run-time decisions.",
