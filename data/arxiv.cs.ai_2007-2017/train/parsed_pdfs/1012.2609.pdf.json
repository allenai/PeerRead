      "text" : "Text Categorization (TC—a.k.a. text classification, or topic spotting), is the task of labeling natural language texts with thematic categories from a predefined set (Sebastiani, 2002). A natural language text is often converted into some format so that the computer or classifiers can “understand” the content of the text. This step is called text representation. In the vector space model (VSM), the content of a text is represented as a vector in the term space, i.e., d= (w1,…, wk) , where k is the term (feature) set size (Lan et al., 2009). The term weight wi indicates the degree of importance of term ti in document d. The term weighting schemes often affect the effectiveness of TC, Leopold and Kindermann (2002) pointed out that the performance of SVM classifiers is dominated by text representation schemes, rather than kernel functions. Therefore, a well-defined term weighting scheme should assign an appropriate weighting value to a term. At present, there are two types of term weighting schemes: unsupervised term weighting schemes (UTWS) and supervised term weighting schemes (STWS).\nThe unsupervised term weighting schemes are widely used for TC task (Yang, & Liu, 1999; Sebastiani, 2002; Guan, Zhou, & Guo, 2009). The most UTWS and their variants are borrowed from information retrieval (IR) field, and the most famous one is tf.idf (term frequency and inverse document frequency) proposed by Jones (Jones, 1972; Jones, 2004). Robertson (2004) tried to present the theoretical justifications of both idf and tf.idf. However, the TC task differs from the IR task. For TC task, the category information of terms of training documents is available in advance. The category\n                                                               *  Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: dqwang@nlsde.buaa.edu.cn (D. Wang), hzhang@nlsde.buaa.edu.cn (H. Zhang), wwj@nlsde.buaa.edu.cn (W. Wu).\ninformation is of importance for TC task. Debole and Sebastiani (2003) proposed the supervised term weighting (SWT) method, which used the known category information in training corpora. They adopted the values of three feature selections (i.e., , information gain and gain ratio) to substitute idf factor during weighting terms. Their thorough experiments have not been shown a uniform superiority of STWS with respect to standard tf.idf term weighting (Debole, & Sebastiani, 2003). However, supervised term weighting schemes seem more reasonable than unsupervised term weighting schemes for TC task. Liu, Loh, and Sun (2009) proposed a probability based supervised term weighting scheme (denoted as prob-based) to solve imbalanced text classification problem. Similarly, Lan et al. (2009) used relevance frequency (rf) to substitute idf and also proposed a novel supervised term weighting, i.e., tf.rf. The two term weighting schemes have a similar term weighting function, except the former considers one factor more than the latter. However, the two term weighting schemes both have one shortcomings. They both simplified a multiclass classification problem into multiple independent binary classification problems. During the process of simplification, the distribution of a term among categories disappears because there are only positive category and negative category.\nPrevious research shows that tf is very important and using tf alone can achieve good performance for TC task (Leopold & Kindermann, 2002; Sebastiani, 2002; Lan et al., 2009). Therefore, researchers focus on idf factor. The discriminating power of a term in document d not only is related to tf, but also is related to the distribution of the term among categories. The intuition is: the fewer a term appears in categories, the more discriminative the term is for text categorization. It is similar to idf in IR task. Therefore, we introduce inverse category frequency (icf) into TC task and propose an icf-based supervised term weighting scheme, which adopts the merits of rf and icf. The icf-based STW outperforms tf.rf and prob-based supervised term weighting schemes on two widely used TC corpora, which are the skewed Reuters-21758 corpus and the balanced 20 Newsgroup corpus."

      "text" : "In recent years, TC has been widely used in many applications, for instance, spam email classification, question categorization (Quan, & Liu) and online news classification. Many TC techniques have been explored in the literature, e.g., centroid-based classifier, kNN (Li, Lu, & Yu, 2004), Naïve Bayes (McCallum & Nigam, 1998), decision tree (Quinlan, 1993) and support vector machines (Cortes & Vapnik, 1995; Joachims, 1997). Because this paper focuses on text representation, readers who are interested in TC techniques can find details from Sebastiani (2002).\nText representation originates in IR field. The famous model of text representation is tf.idf, which gets big success in IR. Salton & Buckley (1988) discussed many typical term weighting formulas in IR field, and they found tfc (normalized tf.idf) is the best document weighting function. Because of tf.idf’s success in IR, researchers retain the text representation for TC task. Many TC tasks usually take tf.idf as the defaulted text representation. Debole & Sebastiani (2003) proposed the supervised term weighting schemes idea, which replaced idf factor with three term selection functions, i.e., information gain, chi-square, and gain ratio. Lan et al. (2009) proposed a new supervised term weighting scheme (tf.rf) to improve the performance of text categorization, and they found term weight is only related to relevant documents, which contain the term. Their experiments showed tf.rf outperformed other supervised term weighting schemes (tf.logOR, tf. , tf.ig) and traditional term weighting schemes (tf.idf, tf, binary). Moreover, Liu, Loh, & Sun (2009) proposed a probability based supervised term weighting scheme to improve performance of unbalanced text classification. Quan, & Liu adopted three new supervised term\nweighting schemes (i.e., qf*icf, iqf*qf*icf and vrf) for question classification. Xue & Zhou (2009) found distributional features (the compactness of the appearance of a term) were useful for text categorization. Pei et al. (2007) proposed an improved tf.idf method, which combined tf.idf and information gain.\nIn this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency into supervised term weighting scheme and propose a new scheme, which considers the distribution of a tem among categories. We present an overview of term weighting schemes, including unsupervised term weighting schemes and supervised term weighting schemes in Section 2. Then we propose an icf-based supervised term weighting scheme and give detailed explanation about this method in Section 3. The data corpora, benchmark methodology of classifier, and evaluation measures are presented in Section 4. We present detailed experimental results on skewed Reuters-21578 corpus and balanced 20 Newsgroup corpus, and give some discussions in Section 5. We conclude this paper in Section 6."

      "text" : "As we mentioned before, the unsupervised term weighting schemes are often borrowed from IR field. The intuition of idf in IR filed is that a query term which occurs in many documents is not a good discriminator, and should be give less weight than one which occurs in a few documents, and the measures is an heuristics implementation of this intuition (Robertson, 2004). Debole & Sebastiani (2003) concluded three assumptions about tf.idf model, i.e., (і) idf assumption：rare terms are no less important than frequent terms; (ii) tf assumption: multiple occurrences of a term in a document are no less important than single occurrence; (iii) normalization assumption: long documents are no more important than short documents for the same quantity of term matching. According to these assumptions, researchers proposed many variants of tf.idf model. Here we present its standard “ltc” variant (Salton & Buckley, 1988).\n, , | | #\n(1)\nwhere | |, # denote the total number of documents, the number of documents containing term ti in training set Tr, respectively. , has various variants such as raw tem frequency, binary (0 or 1) or log(1+tf). In our study, we use raw term frequency as , . To eliminate the effect of document length, the cosine normalization is performed to normalize the term weight obtained by Eq. (1).\n,\n∑ ,| | (2)\nwhere |T| denotes the total number of unique terms contained in training set Tr. Many researchers believe that term weighting schemes in the form as tf.idf can also be applied into TC task. The unsupervised term weighting schemes often contain two factors, i.e., local weight and global weight. Local weight—the tf term, specifies the weight of term ti within a specific document dj, which is estimated based on the frequency or relative frequency of ti within the document. Global weight—the idf term, is based on counting the number of documents containing the term ti in the collection. The intuition of idf in IR filed seems reasonable. However, it deserves to be carefully weighed for TC task. TC task is different from IR task. For TC task, a term, which occurs in many documents, maybe is a good discriminator, especially when it occurs in a few categories or only one\ncategory. Therefore, we should consider the distribution of a term among categories, rather than the distribution of the term in documents. This is our first motivation to revise the term weighting scheme for TC task."

      "text" : "Researchers have noted tf.idf maybe is not the best text representation model for TC task. Therefore, Debole & Sebastiani (2003) proposed the supervised term weighting schemes. They introduced term (feature) selection into term weighting schemes and made the phases of term weighting to be an activity of supervised learning, in which information on membership of training documents in categories is used. Because later research showed using feature selection metrics (such as , information gain, gain ratio, Odds Ratio, and so on) to weight term is not superior to traditional tf.idf model (Liu, Loh, and Sun, 2009; Lan et al, 2009), we do not give detailed discussion about this method, readers who are interested in the method can obtain details from Debole & Sebastiani (2003).\nRecently, two new supervised term weighting schemes are proposed, i.e., tf.rf and prob-based. The two methods both adopt “local policy”, that is, in each experiment, a chosen category c is tagged as positive category, and the rest categories in training corpus are combined together as the negative category (Lan et al, 2009). This is a binary classification and the fundamental information elements used for term weighting scheme are shown in Table 1. Lan et al. (2009) proposed tf.rf supervised term weighting scheme and its formula is expressed as\n. 2 ,\n(3)\nIn addition, Liu, Loh, & Sun (2009) proposed prob-based supervised term weighting scheme and its formula is expressed as\n,\n1 (4)\nwhere is the maximum frequency of a term in document . The two supervised term weighting schemes have a common factor, i.e., a/c. It means the weight of term ti is related to relevant documents that contain this term ti (Lan et al. 2009). There are four different factors between Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), i.e., (і) The base of logarithmic operation of rf factor in Eq. (3) is 2, whereas the base is e (natural number) in Eq. (4); (ii) the constant is 2, 1 respectively in Eq.(3) and Eq. (4); (iii) tf factor in Eq. (4) is divided by , whereas tf in Eq. (3) is raw term frequency; (iv) Eq. (4) considers the ratio between relevant documents and irrelevant documents in category , i.e., a/b.\nAs we know, prob-based supervised term weighting scheme is proposed to deal with imbalanced text classification, so a/b is considered to balance the rare categories. For instance, given two categories\n(major category, which contains 100 documents) and (minor category, which just contains 3\ndocuments.), if = 50, = 40 and = 2, 1, then\n. The term weighting value in\nis improved by the factor a/b. This will improve the probability of assigning a document to . However, introducing the parameter b (the number of documents which do not contain term ti in specified category ) has no any intuitive explanation. Just as the authors presented, prob-based supervised term weighting scheme just gives more weight to terms occurred in minor category. In our experiments on skewed Reuters-21578, prob-based supervised term weighting scheme obtained worse performance. However, after removing the factor a/b, having the similar form as tf.rf, the macro-F1 and micro-F1 on unbalanced Reuters-21578 corpus improve obviously. Through our experiments, we verify the a/b factor is less important than a/c and it maybe affects the performance of a classifier.\nTf.rf supervised term weighting scheme outperforms prob-based because it just considers the frequency of relevant documents. However, tf.rf favors terms which frequently occurs in positive category. It is opposite to idf, which favors rare terms. For instance, if a term ti just occurs once in\ncategory , ti is a good discriminator for category . However, the rf ti 2 , 3.\nFollowing Zipf’s law of regular words (Zipf, 1949), the frequency of many terms in a big corpus should be one, and rf assigns less weight to these terms. This will result in the discriminating power of these words decreases or disappears.\nBesides, tf.rf and prob-based supervised term weighting schemes both have one shortness, i.e., the distribution of a term among categories disappears during partitioning training corpus into positive and negative categories. Just as we know, if a term occurs in many categories, then it is not a good discriminator. This is similar to idf assumption. Tf.rf and prob-based supervised term weighting schemes do not consider the factor."

      "text" : "In this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency (icf) into supervised term weighting scheme for TC task. Two concepts are defined as\nCategory frequency (cf): the number of categories in which term ti occurs. Inverse category frequency (icf): the formula of icf is similar to idf and it is expressed as\nti | | (5)\nwhere |C| denotes the total number of categories in the training corpus. The icf have been widely used in many TC tasks. For instance, Quan, & Liu used a variant of icf as one factor in their question categorization problem. Meanwhile, Guan, Zhou, & Guo (2009) adopted icf to construct centroid vector of category for centroid-based classifier and their Class-Feature-Centroid classifier outperformed SVM classifiers on closed test. The intuition behind icf is: the less categories a term occurs in, the more discriminating power the term contributes to text categorization. This assumption is named icf assumption. Icf favors rare terms and biases against popular terms.\nTherefore, we introduce icf factor into tf.rf and propose a novel icf-based supervised term weighting scheme. Its formula is expressed as\n2 ,\n| | (6)\nIcf-based supervised term weighting scheme contains three factors. Tf factor is the raw term frequency; rf factor measures the distribution of term ti between positive category and negative category; icf factor measures the distribution of term ti among categories. The icf information can be acquired before partitioning training corpus.\nFor future clarification of two supervised term weighting schemes, consider the terms t1, t2 having distributions given in Table 2, and given t1 occurs in fewer categories than t2. According to Eq. (3), we know tf.rf ( t1) = tf.rf ( t2). Tf.rf just considers the distribution of a term in positive and negative categories. However, the discriminating power of t1 should be larger than that of t2, because t1 occurs in fewer categories than t2. According to Eq. (6), we can find icf-based ( t1) > icf-based ( t2). It means icf-based supervised term weighting scheme seems more reasonable than tf.rf. Our experiments on real-world datasets verify our starting point."

The intuition behind idf seems less reasonable for TC task than IR task. In this paper, we introduce inverse category frequency into supervised term weighting schemes and propose a novel icf-based method. The method combines icf and relevance frequency (rf) to weight terms in training dataset. Our experiments have shown that icf-based supervised term weighting scheme is superior to tf.rf and prob-based supervised term weighting schemes and tf.idf based on two widely used datasets, i.e., the unbalanced Reuters-21578 corpus and the balanced 20 Newsgroup corpus. We also present the detailed evaluations of each category of the two datasets among the four term weighting schemes on precision, recall and F1 measure.",
