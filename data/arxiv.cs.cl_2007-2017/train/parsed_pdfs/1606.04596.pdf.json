      "text" : "End-to-end neural machine translation (NMT), which leverages a single, large neural network to directly transform a source-language sentence into a target-language sentence, has attracted increasing attention in recent several years (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). Free of latent structure design and feature engineering that are critical in conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993; Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005), NMT has proven to excel in model-\n∗ Yang Liu is the corresponding author.\ning long-distance dependencies by enhancing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with the gating (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1993; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) and attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2015).\nHowever, most existing NMT approaches suffer from a major drawback: they heavily rely on parallel corpora for training translation models. This is because NMT directly models the probability of a target-language sentence given a source-language sentence and does not have a separate language model like SMT (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). Unfortunately, parallel corpora are usually only available for a handful of resourcerich languages and restricted to limited domains such as government documents and news reports. In contrast, SMT is capable of exploiting abundant target-side monolingual corpora to boost fluency of translations. Therefore, the unavailability of large-scale, high-quality, and wide-coverage parallel corpora hinders the applicability of NMT.\nAs a result, several authors have tried to use abundant monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Gulccehre et al. (2015) propose two methods, which are referred to as shallow fusion and deep fusion, to integrate a language model into NMT. The basic idea is to use the language model to score the candidate words proposed by the translation model at each time step or concatenating the hidden states of the language model and the decoder. Although their approach leads to significant improvements, one possible downside is that the network architecture has to be modified to integrate the language model.\nAlternatively, Sennrich et al. (2015) propose two approaches to exploiting monolingual corpora that is transparent to network architectures. The first approach pairs monolingual sentences with dummy input. Then, the parameters of encoder\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 59\n6v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n0 D\nec 2\n01 6\nand attention model are fixed when training on these pseudo parallel sentence pairs. In the second approach, they first train a nerual translation model on the parallel corpus and then use the learned model to translate a monolingual corpus. The monolingual corpus and its translations constitute an additional pseudo parallel corpus. Similar ideas have also been suggested in conventional SMT (Ueffing et al., 2007; Bertoldi and Federico, 2009). Sennrich et al. (2015) report that their approach significantly improves translation quality across a variety of language pairs.\nIn this paper, we propose semi-supervised learning for neural machine translation. Given labeled (i.e., parallel corpora) and unlabeled (i.e., monolingual corpora) data, our approach jointly trains source-to-target and target-to-source translation models. The key idea is to append a reconstruction term to the training objective, which aims to reconstruct the observed monolingual corpora using an autoencoder. In the autoencoder, the source-to-target and target-to-source models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. As the inference is intractable, we propose to sample the full search space to improve the efficiency. Specifically, our approach has the following advantages:\n1. Transparent to network architectures: our approach does not depend on specific architectures and can be easily applied to arbitrary end-to-end NMT systems.\n2. Both the source and target monolingual corpora can be used: our approach can benefit NMT not only using target monolingual corpora in a conventional way, but also the monolingual corpora of the source language.\nExperiments on Chinese-English NIST datasets show that our approach results in significant improvements in both directions over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems."

D can be seen as labeled data for the task of predicting a target sentence y given a source sentence x.\nAs P (y|x;θ) is modeled by a single, large neural network, there does not exist a separate target language model P (y;θ) in NMT.

      "text" : "It is appealing to explore the more readily available, abundant monolingual corpora to improve NMT. Let us first consider an unsupervised setting: how to train NMT models on a monolingual corpus T = {y(t)}Tt=1?\nOur idea is to leverage autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011): (1) encoding an observed target sentence into a latent source sentence using a target-to-source translation model and (2) decoding the source sentence to reconstruct the observed target sentence using a source-to-target model. For example, as shown in Figure 1(b), given an observed English sentence “Bush held a talk with Sharon”, a target-to-source translation model (i.e., encoder) transforms it into a Chinese translation “bushi yu shalong juxing le huitan” that is unobserved on the training data (highlighted in grey). Then, a source-to-target translation model (i.e., decoder) reconstructs the observed English sentence from the Chinese translation.\nMore formally, let P (y|x;−→θ) and P (x|y;←−θ ) be source-to-target and target-to-source translation models respectively, where −→ θ and ←− θ are corresponding model parameters. An autoencoder aims to reconstruct the observed target sentence via a latent source sentence:\nP (y′|y;−→θ ,←−θ ) = ∑ x P (y′,x|y;−→θ ,←−θ )\n= ∑ x\nP (x|y;←−θ )︸ ︷︷ ︸ encoder P (y′|x;−→θ )︸ ︷︷ ︸ decoder , (2)\nwhere y is an observed target sentence, y′ is a copy of y to be reconstructed, and x is a latent source sentence.\nWe refer to Eq.

Note that our autoencoders inherit the same spirit from conventional autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2011) except that the hidden layer is denoted by a latent sentence instead of real-valued vectors.\nthe observed source sentence via a latent target sentence:\nP (x′|x;−→θ ,←−θ ) = ∑ y P (x′,y|x;←−θ )\n= ∑ y\nP (y|x;−→θ )︸ ︷︷ ︸ encoder P (x′|y;←−θ )︸ ︷︷ ︸ decoder .

For each iteration, besides the mini-batch from the parallel corpus, we also construct two additional mini-batches by randomly selecting sentences from the source and target monolingual corpora.

As |X̃ (y)| X |(y)|, it is possible to calculate Eq. (9) efficiently by enumerating all candidates in X̃ (y). In practice, we find this approximation results in significant improvements and k = 10 seems to suffice to keep the balance between efficiency and translation quality."

The parallel corpus from LDC consists of 2.56M sentence pairs with 67.53M Chinese words and 74.81M English words. The vocabulary sizes of Chinese and English are 0.21M and 0.16M, respectively. We use the Chinese and English parts of the Xinhua portion of the GIGAWORD corpus as the monolingual corpora. The Chinese monolingual corpus contains 18.75M sentences with 451.94M words. The English corpus contains 22.32M sentences with 399.83M words. The vocabulary sizes of Chinese and English are 0.97M and 1.34M, respectively.\nFor Chinese-to-English translation, we use the NIST 2006 Chinese-English dataset as the validation set for hyper-parameter optimization and model selection. The NIST 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 datasets serve as test sets. Each Chinese sentence has four reference translations. For English-to-Chinese translation, we use the NIST datasets in a reverse direction: treating the first English sentence in the four reference translations as a source sentence and the original input Chinese sentence as the single reference translation. The evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as calculated by the multi-bleu.perl script.\nWe compared our approach with two state-ofthe-art SMT and NMT systems:\n1. MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007): a phrase-based SMT system;\n2. RNNSEARCH (Bahdanau et al., 2015): an attention-based NMT system.\nFor MOSES, we use the default setting to train the phrase-based translation on the parallel corpus and optimize the parameters of log-linear models using the minimum error rate training algorithm (Och, 2003). We use the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to train 4-gram language models.\nFor RNNSEARCH, we use the parallel corpus to train the attention-based neural translation models. We set the vocabulary size of word embeddings to 30K for both Chinese and English. We follow Luong et al. (2015) to address rare words.\nOn top of RNNSEARCH, our approach is capable of training bidirectional attention-based neural translation models on the concatenation of parallel and monolingual corpora. The sample size k is set to 10. We set the hyper-parameter λ1 = 0.1 and\nλ2 = 0 when we add the target monolingual corpus, and λ1 = 0 and λ2 = 0.1 for source monolingual corpus incorporation. The threshold of gradient clipping is set to 0.05. The parameters of our model are initialized by the model trained on parallel corpus."

(9)).\nFigure 2 shows the BLEU scores of various settings of k over time. Only the English monolingual corpus is appended to the training data. We observe that increasing the size of the approximate search space generally leads to improved BLEU scores. There are significant gaps between k = 1 and k = 5. However, keeping increasing k does not result in significant improvements and decreases the training efficiency. We find that k = 10 achieves a balance between training efficiency and translation quality. As shown in Figure 3, similar findings are also observed on the English-to-Chinese validation set. Therefore, we set k = 10 in the following experiments."

To answer this question, we investigate the effect of OOV ratio on translation quality, which is defined as\nratio = ∑ y∈yJy /∈ VDtK |y| , (10)\nwhere y is a target-language sentence in the monolingual corpus T , y is a target-language word in y, VDt is the vocabulary of the target side of the parallel corpus D.\nIntuitively, the OOV ratio indicates how a sentence in the monolingual resembles the parallel corpus. If the ratio is 0, all words in the monolingual sentence also occur in the parallel corpus.\nFigure 4 shows the effect of OOV ratio on the Chinese-to-English validation set. Only English monolingual corpus is appended to the parallel corpus during training. We constructed four monolingual corpora of the same size in terms of sentence pairs. “0% OOV” means the OOV ratio is 0% for all sentences in the monolingual corpus. “10% OOV” suggests that the OOV ratio is\nno greater 10% for each sentence in the monolingual corpus. We find that using a monolingual corpus with a lower OOV ratio generally leads to higher BLEU scores. One possible reason is that low-OOV monolingual corpus is relatively easier to reconstruct than its high-OOV counterpart and results in better estimation of model parameters.\nFigure 5 shows the effect of OOV ratio on the English-to-Chinese validation set. Only English monolingual corpus is appended to the parallel corpus during training. We find that “0% OOV” still achieves the highest BLEU scores."

We find that exploiting monolingual corpora dramatically improves translation performance in both Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese directions.\nRelying only on parallel corpus, RNNSEARCH outperforms MOSES trained also only on parallel corpus. But the capability of making use of abundant monolingual corpora enables MOSES to achieve much higher BLEU scores than RNNSEARCH only using parallel corpus.\nInstead of using all sentences in the monolingual corpora, we constructed smaller monolingual corpora with zero OOV ratio: 2.56M Chinese sentences with 47.51M words and 2.56M English English sentences with 37.47M words. In other words, the monolingual corpora we used in the experiments are much smaller than those used by MOSES.\nBy adding English monolingual corpus, our approach achieves substantial improvements over RNNSEARCH using only parallel corpus (up to +4.7 BLEU points). In addition, significant improvements are also obtained over MOSES using both parallel and monolingual corpora (up to +3.5 BLEU points).\nAn interesting finding is that adding English monolingual corpora helps to improve English-toChinese translation over RNNSEARCH using only parallel corpus (up to +3.2 BLEU points), suggesting that our approach is capable of improving NMT using source-side monolingual corpora.\nIn the English-to-Chinese direction, we obtain similar findings. In particular, adding Chi-\nnese monolingual corpus leads to more benefits to English-to-Chinese translation than adding English monolingual corpus. We also tried to use both Chinese and English monolingual corpora through simply setting all the λ to 0.1 but failed to obtain further significant improvements.\nTherefore, our findings can be summarized as follows:\n1. Adding target monolingual corpus improves over using only parallel corpus for source-totarget translation;\n2. Adding source monolingual corpus also improves over using only parallel corpus for source-to-target translation, but the improvements are smaller than adding target monolingual corpus;\n3. Adding both source and target monolingual corpora does not lead to further significant improvements."

Both the two approaches use the same parallel and monolingual corpora. Our approach achieves significant improvements over Sennrich et al. (2015) in both Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese directions (up to +1.8 and +1.0 BLEU points). One possible reason is that Sennrich et al. (2015) only use the pesudo parallel corpus for parameter estimation for once (see Step 4 above) while our approach enables source-to-target and targetto-source models to interact with each other iteratively on both parallel and monolingual corpora.\nTo some extent, our approach can be seen as an iterative extension of Sennrich et al.

They use an existing translation model to translate unseen source text, which can be paired with its translations to form a pseudo parallel corpus. This process iterates until convergence. While Klementiev et al. (2012) propose an approach to estimating phrase translation probabilities from monolingual corpora, Zhang and Zong (2013) directly extract parallel phrases from monolingual corpora using retrieval techniques. Another important line of research is to treat translation on monolingual corpora as a decipherment problem (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Dou et al., 2014).\nClosely related to Gulccehre et al.

    "abstractText" : "While end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT) has made remarkable progress recently, NMT systems only rely on parallel corpora for parameter estimation. Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality, and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semisupervised approach for training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the sourceto-target and target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the target language, but also of the source language. Experiments on the ChineseEnglish dataset show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems.",
