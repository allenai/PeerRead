Here we compare the performances of four systems on datasets covering 16 languages, two of these systems being feature-based (MEMMs and CRFs) and two of them being neural-based (bi-LSTMs). We show that, on average, all four approaches perform similarly and reach state-of-the-art results. Yet better performances are obtained with our feature-based models on lexically richer datasets (e.g. for morphologically rich languages), whereas neural-based results are higher on datasets with less lexical variability (e.g. for English). These conclusions hold in particular for the MEMM models relying on our system MElt, which benefited from newly designed features. This shows that, under certain conditions, featurebased approaches enriched with morphosyntactic lexicons are competitive with respect to neural methods.\nKey-words: Part-of-Speech Tagging, Feature-based models, Neural models, MEMM, CRF, biLSTM, Multilingual Analysis\nUtilisation d’informations lexicales externes pour l’annotation multilingue en parties du discours\nRésumé : Les lexiques morphosyntaxiques et les représentations vectorielles des mots ont chacun montré leur utilité pour améliorer la précision d’étiqueteurs morphosyntaxiques statistiques.

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Part-of-speech tagging is now a classic task in natural language processing, for which many systems have been developed or adapted for a large variety of languages. Its aim is to associate each “word” with a morphosyntactic tag, whose granularity can range from a simple morphosyntactic category, or part-of-speech (hereafter PoS), to finer categories enriched with morphological features (gender, number, case, tense, mood, etc.).\nThe use of machine learning algorithms trained on manually annotated corpora has long become the standard way to develop PoS taggers. A large variety of algorithms have been used, such as (in approximative chronological order) bigram and trigram hidden Markov models (Merialdo, 1994; Brants, 1996, 2000), decision trees (Schmid, 1994; Magerman, 1995), maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; Constant and Tellier, 2012). With such machine learning algorithms, it is possible to build PoS taggers for any language, provided adequate training data is available.\nAs a complement to annotated corpora, it has previously been shown that external lexicons are valuable sources of information, in particular morphosyntactic lexicons, which provide a large inventory of (word, PoS) pairs. Such lexical information can be used in the form of constraints at tagging time (Kim et al., 1999; Hajič, 2000) or during the training process as additional features combined with standard features extracted from the training corpus (Chrupała et al., 2008; Goldberg et al., 2009; Denis and Sagot, 2012).\nIn recent years, a different approach to modelling lexical information and integrating it into natural language processing systems has emerged, namely the use of vector representations for words or word sequences (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Chrupała, 2013; Ling et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015; Müller and Schütze, 2015). Such representations, which are generally extracted from large amounts of raw text, have proved very useful for numerous tasks including PoS tagging, in particular when used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and more specifically in mono- or bi-directional, word-level and/or character-level long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Ling et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015; Plank et al., 2016).\nBoth approaches to representing lexical properties and to integrating them into a PoS tagger improve tagging results. Yet they rely on resources of different natures. The main advantage of word vectors is that they are built in an unsupervised way, only requiring large amounts of raw textual data. They also encode finer-grained information than usual morphosyntactic lexicons, most of which do not include any quantitative data, not even simple frequency information. Conversely, lexical resources often provide information about scarcely attested words, for which corpus-based approaches such as word vector representations are of limited relevance. Moreover, morphological or morphosyntactic lexicons already exist for a number of languages, including less-resourced langauges for which it might be difficult to obtain the large amounts of raw data necessary to extract word vector representations.\nOur main goal is therefore to compare the respective impact of external lexicons and word vector representations on the accuracy of PoS models. This question has already been investigated for 6 languages by Müller and Schütze (2015) using the state-of-the-art CRF-based tagging system MarMoT. The authors found that their best-performing word-vector-based PoS tagging models outperform their models that rely on morphosyntactic resources (lexicons or morphological analysers). In this paper, we report on larger comparison, carried out in a larger multilingual setting and comparing different tagging models. Using different 16 datasets, we compare the performances of two feature-based models enriched with external lexicons and of two LSTMbased models enriched with word vector representations. A secondary goal of our work is to compare the relative improvements linked to the use of external lexical information in the two\nRR n° 8924"

      "text" : "feature-based models, which use different models (MEMM vs. CRF) and feature sets. More specifically, our starting point is the MElt system (Denis and Sagot, 2012), an MEMM tagging system. We first briefly describe this system and the way we adapted it by integrating our own set of corpus-based and lexical features. We then introduce the tagging models we have trained for 16 different languages using our adapted version of MElt. These models are trained on the Universal Dependencies (v1.2) corpus set (Nivre and al., 2015), complemented by morphosyntactic lexicons. We compare the accuracy of our models with the scores obtained by the CRF-based system MarMoT (Müller et al., 2013; Müller and Schütze, 2015), retrained on the same corpora and the same external morphosyntactic lexicons. We also compare our results to those obtained by the best bidirectional LSTM models described by Plank et al. (2016), which both make use of Polyglot word vector representations published by Al-Rfou et al. (2013). We will show that an optimised enrichment of feature-based models with morphosyntactic lexicon results in significant accuracy gains. The macro-averaged accuracy of our enriched MElt models is above that of enriched MarMoT models and virtually identical to that of LSTMs enriched with word vector representations. More precisely, per-language results indicate that lexicons provide more useful information for languages with a high lexical variability (such as morphologically rich languages), whereas word vectors are more informative for languages with a lower lexical variability (such as English)."

      "heading" : "2 MElt",
      "text" : "MElt (Denis and Sagot, 2012) is a tagging system based on maximum entropy Markov models (MEMM) (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), a class of discriminative models that are suitable for sequence labelling (Ratnaparkhi, 1996). The basic set of features used by MElt is given in (Denis and Sagot, 2012). It is a superset of the feature sets used by Ratnaparkhi (1996) and Toutanova and Manning (2000) and includes both local standard features (for example the current word itself and its prefixes and suffixes of length 1 to 4) and contextual standard features (for example the tag just assigned to the preceding word). In particular, with respect to Ratnaparkhi’s feature set, MElt’s basic feature set lifts the restriction that local standard features used to analyse the internal composition of the current word should only apply to rare words.\nOne of the advantages of feature-based models such as MEMMs and CRFs is that complementary information can be easily added in the form of additional features. This was investigated for instance by Kübler et al. (2010), whose best-performing model for PoS tagging dialogues was obtained with a version of MElt extended with dialogue-specific features. Yet the motivation of MElt’s developers was first and foremost to investigate the best way to integrate lexical information extracted from large-scale morphosyntactic lexical resources into their models, on top of the training data (Denis and Sagot, 2012). They showed that performances are better when this external lexical information is integrated in the form of additional lexical features than when the external lexicon is used as constraints at tagging time.1 These lexical features can also be divided into local lexical features (for example the list of possible tags known to the external lexicon for the current word) and contextual lexical features (for example the list of possible tags known to the external lexicon for surrounding words). In particular, lexical contextual features provide a means to model the right context of the current word, made of words that have not yet been tagged by the system but for which the lexicon often provides a list of possible tags. Moreover, tagging accuracy for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words is improved, as a result of the fact that words unknown to the training corpus might be known to the external lexicon.\n1For instance by constraining the tagger in such a way that words known to the lexicon can only be associated with tags provided by the lexicon.\nInria"

Since our goal was to carry out experiments in a multilingual setting, we have decided to design our own set of features, using the standard MElt features as a starting point. With respect to the original MElt feature set, we have added new ones, such as prefixes and suffixes of the following word, as well as a hybrid contextual feature obtained by concatenating the tag predicted for the preceding word and the tag(s) provided by the external lexicon for the following word.\nIn order to select the best performing feature set, we carried out a series of experiments using the multilingual dataset provided during the SPMRL parsing shared task (Seddah et al., 2013b). This included discarding useless or harmful features and selecting the maximal length of the prefixes and suffixes to be used as features, both for the current word and for the following word.2\nWe incorporated in MElt the best performing feature set, described in Table 1. All models discussed in this paper are based on this feature set."

Therefore, for each language, we simply extracted from the corresponding lexicon the PoS of each word based on its morphological tags, by removing all information provided except for its coarsest-level category.5 We also added entries for punctuations when the source lexicons did not contain any.\nWe also performed experiments in which we retained the full original tags provided by the lexicons, with all morphological features included. On average, results were slightly better than those presented in the paper, although not statistically significantly. Moreover, the granularity of tag inventories in the lexicons is diverse, which makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about results based on full tags. This is why we only report results based on (coarse) PoS extracted from the original lexicons."

FREQBIN trains bi-LSTMs to predict for each input word both a PoS and a label that represents its log frequency in the training data. As they word it, “the idea behind this model is to make the representation predictive for frequency, which encourages the model not to share representations between common and rare words, thus benefiting the handling of rare tokens.”\nThe results, which are also displayed in Figures 1 and 2, show that all systems reach very similar results on average, although discrepancies can be observed from one dataset to another, on which we shall comment shortly. The best performing system in terms of macro-average is MElt (96.60%). Both bi-LSTM systems reach the same score (96.58%), the difference with MElt’s results being non significant, whereas MarMoT is only 0.14% behind (96.46%). Given the better baseline scores of the neural approaches, these results show that the benefit of using external lexicons in the feature-based models MElt and MarMoT are much higher than those using Polyglot word vector representations as initialisations for bi-LSTMs.\nYet these very similar overall results reflect a different picture when focusing on OOV tagging accuracy. The best models for OOV tagging accuracy are, by far, FREQBIN models, which are beaten by MarMoT and by MElt only once each (on English and Danish respectively). The comparison on OOV tagging between MElt and MarMoT shows that MElt performs better on average than MarMoT, despite the fact that MarMoT’s baseline results were better than those reached by MElt. This shows that the information provided by external morphosyntactic lexicons is better exploited by MElt’s lexical features than by those used by MarMoT. On the other hand, the comparison of both bi-LSTM-based approaches confirm that the FREQBIN models is better by over 10% absolute on OOV tagging accuracy (94.28% vs. 83.59%), with 65% lower error rate.\nOne of the important differences between the lexical information provided by an external lexicon and word vectors built from raw corpora, apart from the very nature of the lexical\nInria"

All words in a morphosyntactic lexicon are associated with information of a same granularity and quality, which is not the case with word representations such as provided by Polyglot. Models that take advantage of external lexicons should therefore perform comparatively better on datasets containing a higher proportion of rarer words, provided the lexicons’ coverage is high. In order to confirm this intuition, we have used a lexical richness metric based on the type/token ratio. Since this ratio is well-known for being sensitive to corpus length, we normalised it by computing it over the 60,000 first tokens of each training set. When this normalised type/token ratio is plotted against the difference between the results of MElt and both bi-LSTM-based models, the expected correlation is clearly visible (see Figure 3). This explains why MElt obtains better results on the morphologically richer Slavic datasets (average normalised type/token ratio: 0.28, average accuracy difference: 0.32 compared to both bi-LSTM+Polyglot and FREQBIN+Polyglot) and, at the other end of the spectrum, significantly worse results on the English dataset (normalised type/token ratio: 0.15, average accuracy difference: -0.56 compared to bi-LSTM+Polyglot, -0.57 compared to FREQBIN+Polyglot)."

(2016). As mentioned above, work on the contribution of word vector representations to feature-based approaches has been carried out by Müller and Schütze (2015). However, the exploitation of existing morphosyntactic or morphological lexicons in neural models is a less studied question. Improvements over the state of the art might be achieved by integrating lexical information both from an external lexicon and from word vector representations into tagging models.\nIn that regard, further work will be required to understand which class of models perform the best. An option would be to integrate feature-based models such as a CRF with an LSTM-based layer, following recent proposals such as the one proposed by Lample et al. (2016) for named entity recognition."

Both approaches to representing lexical properties and to integrating them into a PoS tagger improve tagging results. Yet they rely on resources of different natures. The main advantage of word vectors is that they are built in an unsupervised way, only requiring large amounts of raw textual data. They also encode finer-grained information than usual morphosyntactic lexicons, most of which do not include any quantitative data, not even simple frequency information. Conversely, lexical resources often provide information about scarcely attested words, for which corpus-based approaches such as word vector representations are of limited relevance. Moreover, morphological or morphosyntactic lexicons already exist for a number of languages, including less-resourced langauges for which it might be difficult to obtain the large amounts of raw data necessary to extract word vector representations. Our main goal is therefore to compare the respective impact of external lexicons and word vector representations on the accuracy of PoS models. This question has already been investigated for 6 languages by Müller and Schütze (2015) using the state-of-the-art CRF-based tagging system MarMoT.",

Here we compare the performances of four systems on datasets covering 16 languages, two of these systems being feature-based (MEMMs and CRFs) and two of them being neural-based (bi-LSTMs). We show that, on average, all four approaches perform similarly and reach state-of-the-art results. Yet better performances are obtained with our feature-based models on lexically richer datasets (e.g. for morphologically rich languages), whereas neural-based results are higher on datasets with less lexical variability (e.g. for English). These conclusions hold in particular for the MEMM models relying on our system MElt, which benefited from newly designed features. This shows that, under certain conditions, featurebased approaches enriched with morphosyntactic lexicons are competitive with respect to neural methods.

Nous comparons ici les performances de quatre systèmes sur des jeux de données couvrant 16 langues, deux de ces systèmes reposant sur des traits (MEMM et CRF) et deux autres sur des approches neuronales (bi-LSTM). Nous montrons qu’en moyenne les quatre approches obtiennent des performances similaires de niveau état-de-l’art. Néanmoins, nos modèles reposant sur des traits ont de meilleures performances sur les jeux de données lexicalement plus riches (par exemple sur des langues à morphologie riche), alors que les résultats obtenus par les approches neuronales sont meilleurs sur les jeux de données dont la variabilité lexicale est moindre (par exemple pour l’anglais). Ces conclusions sont vraies en particulier pour nos modèles de type MEMM faisant usage de notre système MElt, qui s’appuie sur un jeu de traits renouvelé. Ceci montre que, sous certaines conditions, les approches par traits enrichies par des lexiques morphosyntaxiques sont compétitifs par rapport aux approches neuronales.
