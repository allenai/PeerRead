For some user-defined trade-off parameter $\\beta$ $\\in$ (0, 1), the proposed algorithm achieves cumulative regret bounds of O(T^max{$\\beta$,1--$\\beta$}) and O(T^(1--$\\beta$/2)) for the loss and the constraint violations respectively. Our results hold for convex losses and can handle arbitrary convex constraints without requiring knowledge of the number of rounds in advance. Our contributions improve over the best known cumulative regret bounds by Mahdavi, et al. (2012) that are respectively O(T^1/2) and O(T^3/4) for general convex domains, and respectively O(T^2/3) and O(T^2/3) when further restricting to polyhedral domains. We supplement the analysis with experiments validating the performance of our algorithm in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 10:32:09 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07422v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["rodolphe jenatton", "jim c huang", "c\u00e9dric archambeau"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.07422"}
