Dissimilarities are assessed based on the attribute values describing the objects. Often, distance measures are used. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, where interesting patterns and structures can be found directly from very large data sets with little or none of the background knowledge.

      "text" : "Unlike classification and regression, which analyze class-labeled data sets, clustering analyzes data objects without consulting class labels. In many cases, class labeled data may simply not exist at the beginning[1]. The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity. That is a cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to one another within the same cluster and are dissimilar to the objects in other cluster. Each cluster so formed cab be viewed as a class of object from which rules can be derived. Besides the term data clustering as synonyms like cluster analysis, automatic classification, numerical taxonomy, botrology and typological analysis."

      "text" : "Before looking into the clustering algorithms first of all we need to study about the type of data that often occur in the cluster analysis. Main memory based clustering algorithms operates on either on object-by-variable structure or object-by-object structure. Object-by-variable is represented as Data matrix where as the object-by-object structure is represented as Dissimilarity matrix. As per the clustering principle we need to calculate the dissimilarity between the objects. The objects cited in data mining text book by Han and Kamber are described as: Interval-scaled variables: The variables which are continuous measurements of a roughly linear scale. Example: Marks, Age, Height etc.\nBinary variables: This variable has only two states either 0 or 1.\nNominal variables: Nominal is the generalization of binary variable which can take more than two states. Example rainbow colors have VIBGRO colors so six states are considered.\nOrdinal variables: These variables are very useful for registering subjective assessment qualities that cannot be measured objectively. It is a set of continuous data of an unknown scale\nRatio-scaled variables: These variables make a positive measurement on a non-linear scale, such as an exponential scale."

      "text" : "There exist a large number of clustering algorithms in the literature. The choice of clustering algorithm depends both on the type of data available and on the particular purpose and application. If cluster analysis is used as a descriptive or exploratory tool, it is possible to try several algorithms on the same data to see what the data may disclose. In general, major clustering methods can be classified into the following categories.\n1. Hierarchical\n2. Density\nThe above methods are not contemporary methods\nPartitioning methods\n3. K-means\n4. K-Medoids\n5. Markov Clustering Algorithm(MCL)\n6. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\n7. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\nThe above require preliminary knowledge of data in order to choose k\nSome clustering algorithms integrate the ideas of several clustering methods, so that it is sometimes difficult to classify a given algorithm as uniquely belonging to only one clustering method category."

      "text" : "K means clustering algorithm was developed by J. McQueen and then by J. A. Hartigan and M. A. Wong around 1975. The k-means algorithm takes the input parameter, k, and partitions a set of n objects into k clusters so that the resulting intra-cluster similarity is high whereas the inter-cluster similarity is low. Cluster similarity is measured in regard to the mean value of the objects in a cluster, which can be viewed as the cluster's center of gravity.\nAlgorithm [1] : The k-means algorithm for partitioning based on the mean value of the objects in the cluster.\nInput: The number of clusters k, and a database containing n objects.\nOutput: A set of k clusters which minimizes the squared-error criterion.\nMethod:\n1) arbitrarily choose k objects as the initial cluster centers;\n2) repeat\n3) (re)assign each object to the cluster to which the object is the most similar,\nbased on the mean value of the objects in the cluster;\n4) update the cluster means, i.e., calculate the mean value of the objects for each cluster;\n5) until no change;\nProcedure\nConsider a set of objects with 2-Dimensions (PSCP and CO), let k=4 where k is number\nof clusters which a user would like the objects to be partitioned.\nAccording to the algorithm we arbitrarily choose four objects as four initial cluster\ncenters. Each object is assigned to the cluster based on the cluster center to which it is nearest. The distance between the object and cluster center is measured by Euclidean distance measure because the variables which we are using are of type of interval-based.\nIteration0\nHALL TICKET NO.

The Euclidean distance function measures the distance. The\nformula for this distance between a point X (X1, X2, etc.) and a point Y (Y1, Y2, etc.) is:\n∑ = −=\nn\nj jj yxd 1\n2)(\n-----------------------------------(1)\nDeriving the Euclidean distance between two data points involves computing the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences between corresponding values. We can make the calculation faster by using excel function as =SQRT(SUMSQ(33-B3,49-C3)). The clusters labels used to denote the group are{1,2,3,4}. In the first Iteration we find the distances between data points and the cluster center. Now observing the column values which ever has minimum distance then under cluster group assign its label as:\nNext, the cluster centers are updated. That is, the mean value of each cluster is recalculated based on the current objects in the cluster. Using the new cluster centers, the objects are redistributed to the clusters based on which cluster center is the nearest. Hence after first iteration the new cluster centers are cluster center-1 (30,30), cluster center-2 (63,54),cluster center-3 (73,65) and cluster center-4 (80,71).\nThis process of iteratively reassigning objects to clusters to improve the partitioning is referred to as iterative relocation. Eventually, no reassignment of the objects in the cluster occurs and so the process terminates. The resulting clusters are returned by clustering process.\nIteration3\nHALL TICKET NO.

After Iteration7 we see that the new mean values obtained for four clusters are the same as that of previous step.\nInstead of considering four clusters, if we consider six clusters (k=6) the algorithm\niterates for two times and terminates as the mean values never change after it.\nK-Means method is not guaranteed to converge to global optimum and often terminates at a local optimum. To obtain good results in practice it is common to run the k-means algorithm multiple times with different initial clusters.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of K-Means\n• K-means is relatively scalable and efficient in processing large datasets.\n• The method is not suitable for discovering clusters with non-convex shapes or of very\ndifferent sizes.\n• It is sensitive to noise and outlier data"

Hence, v2 is called the Fiedler vector. Hence v2 is used to recursively partition the graph by separating the components into negative and positive values.

      "text" : "The advantage of the K-Means algorithm is its favorable execution time. Its drawback is that the user has to know in advance how many clusters are searched for. It is observed that K-Means algorithm is efficient for smaller data sets only. Fielder’s method doesn’t require the preliminary knowledge of the number of clusters, but most clustering methods require matrices to be symmetric. Symmetrizing techniques either distort original information or greatly increase the size of the dataset moreover there are many applications where the data is not symmetric like Hyperlinks on the Web."
