      "text" : "We present a sound and complete calculus for causal relevance that uses Pearl's func tional causal models as semantics. The cal culus consists of axioms and rules of inference for reasoning about causal relevance relation ships. We extend the set of known axioms for causal relevance with new axioms and rules of inference. The axioms are then divided into different sets for reasoning about spe cific subclasses of models. These subclasses make up a new decomposition of the class of causal models. At the end, we show how the calculus for causal relevance can be used in the task of identifying causal structure from non-observational data.\n1 Introduction\nCausal relevance is concerned with questions of the form: \"Given that (variable) Z is fixed, would chang ing X alter Y?\" Formal interest in this notion ap pears in the works of Suppes [8] and Salmon [7] who attempted to give it probabilistic interpretation. This paper pursues a logical approach, and starts with the work by Galles and Pearl [2], which, similar to the work on graphoids [5, 3], is based on a set of axioms and rules of inference that defines a formal deductive system. In this system, causal relevance is expressed by logical formulas and new relevance sentences can be derived from old ones through rules of inference.\nSuch deductive system requires an interpretation; that is, a function that maps models to the sets of formulas they \"satisfy\". The models we focus on are Pearl's functional causal models [6]. Once an interpretation is established, a natural question to ask is whether the system is sound (i.e., if every proven statement is true), and whether the system is complete (i.e., if every true statement is provable). In this paper we answer both questions in affirmative for some classes of models.\nTo do so, we define a hierarchy of causal models (see Halpern [4]), governed by new axioms and rules of in ference. Towards the end of the paper (Section 4), we show how information about causal relevance can be used for identifying the structure of causal models from data.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec tion 2, we present Pearl's functional causal models, the formal language of causal relevance, the interpretation of the language, and the classes of causal models. Sec tion 3 presents the axiomatizations, some general re sults about the calculus as well as the proofs for sound ness and completeness. Then, Section 4 shows how this theory can be used to solve identification prob lems. We conclude with a brief summary.\n2 Model Theory\nA causal model is a set of variables in which each vari able may have influence on others. The variables are divided in two groups. The endogenous variables for which the model provides a description of the mech anisms that influence them, and the exogenous vari ables that influence only endogenous variables and are taken as given; i.e., the model does not explain them. In this section we provide a formal definition of causal models.\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that there is one (big) exogenous variable that takes values in a domain for which there are no restrictions. All the endogenous variables for causal models are taken from a finite set X. This set is assumed to be fixed for the rest of the paper and often we use it without mention. Some authors like to say that X is the signature of the theory. It is a technical necessity used to restrict the set of models and the formal language for causal relevance.\n2.1 Causal Models\nA causal model T is a tuple T = (U, {Fy : Y E X}) where U is the domain of the unique exogenous vari-\nUAI 2001 BONET 41\nable and { Fy : Y E X} is a set of equations called modifiable structural equations. Each equation is a function\nFy: IT \"Dx x U --t J)y, XEX Xi'Y\nwhere \"Dx is the domain of variable X, that describes how the variable Y attains its value.\nGiven a subset X � X of endogenous variables, we define the causal (sub)model [x]T, that results from the intervention of setting the value of X to x, as [x]T = (U,{Fy: Y EX}) where Fy = Fy for Y f/. X and F{ = x..l.y for Y E X. This intervention is de noted by the operator do(X = x) that maps causal models into causal models by T\"\" [x]T (see [6]). A causal model defines a system of equations once the exogenous variable had been set. In general, the sys tem may have zero, one or multiple solutions. We will only consider causal models T such that for each sub set X� X and value x for X, the submodel [x]T has a unique solution for all u E U. This class of models was denoted by T.miq in [4] (note that T.miq depends on X).\nThe potential response for variable Y and u E U under intervention do(X = x) is defined as the solution Yin model [x]T when the exogenous variable has value u (denoted by the function u \"\" [x]Y(u)). The main dif ference between causal models and Bayesian networks is that the former incorporate a semantics for all in terventions do(X = x). A counterfactual is a formula built from atomic terms of the form [x]Y(u) (see Pearl [6]). A logical calculus for reasoning about counterfactuals that is sound and complete with respect to Tuniq was given in [4]. One result from the counterfactual calculus that is impor tant to us is the following.\nLemma 1 (Composition; [21) Let W,X, Y be vari ables in a causal model T, x a valuation for X, and u a valuation for the exogenous variable. If [x]W(u) = w and [x]Y(u) = y, then [x,w]Y(u) = y.\nComposition can be briefly summarized by the equa tion [x]Y(u) = [x, [x]W(u)]Y(u) which is valid for all variables Y, W, all valuations x of X, and all u E U. As a remark, note that composition is not about nested interventions, it is just a simple intervention that uses a previously recorded value from another intervention.\n2.2 Language\nWe talk about causal relevance using a simple logical language built from atomic formulas and the standard boolean connectives. The language, that also depends on X, is denoted by .C. Each atomic formula, or just\natom, of .C is of the form (X...,... Y[Z) where X, Y and Z are disjoint subsets of X, and X, Yare non-empty. Intuitively, an atom (X...,... Yf Z) is read as variable X has no influence on variable Y once variable Z had been fixed. The language is inductively defined by (i) every atom is in .C, (ii) if ({) E .C, then ...,({) E .C, and (iii) if rp, ?,b E .C, then ( rp & ?,b), ( rp V ?,b), ( ({) � ?,b) E .C. As is common, a literal is an atom or the negation of an atom. It is positive if it is an atom, otherwise it is negative. We will use capital Greek letters to denote sets of formulas and lower case Greek letters to denote formulas. If r is a set of formulas, the set of positive (resp. negative) literals in r is denoted by Lit+ r (resp. Lit- r).\n2.3 Interpretations\nAn interpretation assigns to each model the set of for mulas that it satisfies. We begin with the interpreta tion for atoms and then extend it to all formulas.\nDefinition 1 A causal model T E Tuniq satisfies the atom (X...,... Y[Z) if and only if\n[x,z,w]Y(·) = [x',z,w]Y(·) (1)\nfor all W disjoint of X, Y, Z, and all valuations x, x', z, w for the variables X, Z and W.\nNote that Eq. (l) is an equality of functions so it must hold for all u E U. We write T I= r.p when T satisfies formula cp, and T I= r when T satisfies all formulas in r. The interpretation is extended to all formulas by (i) T F= ...,({)iff T Jt ({), (ii) T F= (({J&?,/J) iff T F= ({)and T I= ?,b, (iii} T I= ( ({) V ?,b) iff T 1:= ({) or T 1:= ?,b, and (iv) T Jt (rp => ¢) iff T 1:= cp but T Jt ?,b. In the next section, we use the interpretations to de compose the class Tuniq into smaller classes of causal models.\n2.4 Classes of Models\nWe begin with some definitions. The semantic graph associated with model T and u E U is the directed graph G(T, u) with vertex set equal to X and edge set E such that (X, Y) E E if and only if X is a non-trivial argument of Fy( ·; u). The semantic graph G(T) asso ciated with T is the union of all graphs G(T, u). Given two graphs G, G', we write G ::::; G' when G is an edge subgraph of G'.\nDefinition 2 A causal model T is strong recursive if G(T) is a DAG. It is recursive if G(T, u) is a DAG for all u E U.\nLet Tsrec and free be the subclasses of models from 'Tuniq that are strong recursive and recursive respec tively. By definition, Tsrec � Tree � Tuniq·\n42 BONET UAI2001\nWe say that two models T, T' are .C-equivalent, writ ten T � T', if they can not be distinguished by the language; i.e., Vcp[T I= cp ¢:? T' I= cp]. We say that a class 7 is .C-contained into another class T', written T '5: 7', if V(T E n:J(T' E 7')[T � T']. The following diagram shows the partial order induced by '5: among the classes of models (modulo �). The labels at the arrows indicate whether the relation is strict or not.\nNot all the information in this diagram is obvious. The unstrict relations follow from the containments above noted. The fact that 'Tsrec < Tree is seen with the model T with X = {XI. X2}, U = { u, u'} and equations:\nX1(u) = X2(u), X2(u) = 0,\nX1(u') = 0, X2(u') = X1(u') ;\ni.e., with graph X1 += X2. The other strict relation is more difficult to see; we will prove it later.\nFrom now on, we will only consider the equivalence classes generated by�. To simplify notation, however, we write T and Tinstead of [TJ� and 7/:::! respectively.\n3 Axiomatizations\nAn axiomatic system AX is a set of formulas (or schemata) from the language plus a set of rules of in ference. Each rule of inference is a license that allows us to derive new formulas from previous ones. A proof for formula cp from a set r is a finite sequence of for mulas 'Pl, 'P2, .. . , 'Pn = cp such that each 'Pi is either an axiom, a formula in r' or a formula derived us ing a rule of inference from previous ones. We write r f-AX cp if cp can be proved from r in the AX system. An axiomatic system AX is sound with respect to a class of models l iff r f-AX cp implies r F7 cp;1 i.e., everything that can be proved from r is valid in all models that satisfy r. AX is complete with respect to /iff f l=7cp implies f f-Ax cp; i.e., everything that is valid in models that satisfy r can be proved from r. The following list contains all the axioms considered in this paper. It is assumed that the variables in the formulas make them valid .C-formulas; e.g., that W is disjoint of XYZ·in A2.2\nAl.

If X and Y denote variables or sets or variables, then their union, intersection difference and complement (with respect to X) are denoted by XY, X n Y, X \\ Y and xc respectively.\nA3.

YVJZ).\nAxioms A2-A4,A6 and A 7 appeared in Pearl [6]. The other three are new.\nLet r � .C be a set of formulas and fix an axiomatic system AX. The following definitions are standard. r is a closed set if Vcp(f f-AX cp =* cp E f]. The theory associated with r, denoted as ThAx r, is the small est closed set containing r. r is a consistent set if Vcp[cp E ThAx r =* --,cp fl. ThAx f]. A set f' 2 r is an extension of r if it is consistent and maximal. The the ory associated with a model T is the set of all formulas valid in T; i.e. Th T = {cp E .C: T I= cp}.\nThe AXuniq axiomatic system is defined as the Axioms Al-A9 plus Modus Ponens (MP) as the unique rule of inference. Often we say that r is AXuniq-i:Onsistent as an abbreviation for r is consistent with respect to AXuniq. Similarly for extensions and for other ax iomatic systems.\nTheorem 2 AXuniq is sound with respect to Tuniq.\nProof\" The soundness of Al is obvious. Fix u E U. For clarity, we won't write the dependency in u. The soundness of A2, A3, A6 and A 7 was proved in [2]. Axiom A4 is in [6] but its proof has not been published. Therefore, we give the proofs only for A4, A5, A8 and A9. In what follows, lower case Roman letters refer to values for the corresponding capital letters; e.g., x, x' will be valuations for X.

The syntactic graph associated with a maximal consistent set r is the directed graph G(f) with vertex set equal to X and edge set E such that (X, Y) E E if and only if X E Pa(Y).

Thus, by\n44 BONET UAI2001\nhypothesis, there is a path X � P not intercepted by ZYS. Extend the path with the link (P, Y). •\nExample 1: Let X= {X1, ... ,X4} and r be a max imal consistent set containing:\n(X3X4..,..Xll0), •(X2..,..XdX3X4),\n(X1X3X4 ..,..X210), (Xl..,..X2X410),\n(X4 ..,..X310), •(X2 ..,..X3IX1X4), •(X1..,..X3IX2X4),\n(X1X2...,..X4IX3), •(X3..,..X4IX1X2), •(X1..,..X4jX2).\nThen, G(r) is the graph:\nSuppose (X2 ..,..

By The orem 3, there must be a path x2 � x4 not intercepted by X1. Fact that is clearly true in above graph. •\nWe do not know if AXuniq is a complete system for luniq· The next two sections present sound and com plete axiomatizations for Jsrec and Tree respectively.\n3.1 Axiomatization for T.rec\nLet r be a consistent set with respect to AXuniq· We say that an AXuniq--extension r' 2 r is strong recursive if and only if the graph G(r') is a DAG. Consider the following rule of inference.\nDefinition 3 (Strong Recursive Inference) A formula cp can be derived from the set r by the Strong Recursive Inference (SRI) if and only if 'P holds in all strong-recursive extensions of r.\nNote that since the number of possible extensions is finite, checking whether a Strong Recursive Inference is valid or not is a syntactic and decidable criterion.\nFor example if -,(X..,.. Yl0) E r, then (by Theorem 3) there is a path X� Yin any extension ofr. Thus, by SRI and the same Theorem, (Y..,.. XJ0) holds in any strong-recursive extension of r. Thus, the SRI rule captures some notion of paths in graphs. However, it seems to be a. little complex. So, do we need it? Strictly speaking, the answer is no since once X is fixed, then all possible SRI inferences can be encoded into a single (but very large) axiom. In the other hand, it makes things easier since we don't have to find which axiom replaces the SRI rule. We define the axiomatic system AXsrec as the Axioms Al-A9 plus MP and SRI as the rules of inference. Our goal is to prove that it is a. sound and complete system with respect to Jsrec.\nTheorem 4 AXsrec is sound with respect to Tsrec.\nProof: Because of Theorem 2, we only need to prove that the SRI rule is sound with respect to Tsrec· But this is true since if T E Jsrec• then Th T is a strong recursive extension for any r such that T t= r. •\nTo prove completeness, it is enough to show that for every consistent r there exists a model T E fsrec such that T t= r. To see this, assume the claim is true and suppose that cp is not provable from r. Then, ru { ..,<p} is consistent so, by the claim, there is a model T that satisfies r and ...,cp; i.e., r �T.m cp. Therefore, r ¥ <p:::} r �T.rec <p (equiv. to completeness) is true.\nCompleteness\nLet r be a maximal AXsrec-consistent set. We build a model for it by putting together small models whose graphs are called fragments. Each one of these models is built in order to satisfy a different negative literal -,(X-..../>+ YJZ) in r. Formally,\nDefinition 4 (Fragment) Let X, Y be two variables and Z c:;; X. A single-connected DA(fJ G with ver tex set X is called an (X, YIZ)-fragment when for all U, V E G and S, T � X\n(i) if ..,(X..,.. YIZ), then G has a path X .._.. Y not intercepted by Z,\n(ii} if U E G, then U is in X .._.. Y or U is a root, (iii} if (U..,.. VJT), then T intercepts U .._.. V, and (iv) if S is minimal such that (U..,.. V S IT), then ei-\nther T intercepts U .._.. V, or S contains an an cestor of V not in U ....__. V.\nExample 2: Intuitively, an (X, YJZ)-fragment is a subgraph from G(r) that witnesses the literal -,(X..,.. YJZ). Let's consider the literal ...,{Xt..,.. X4J0) in Ex ample 1. We show that the following graph is an (X1, X410)-fragment:\nClearly, it satisfies (i) and (ii) of Definition 4. For (iii}, note that the only relevances that need to be considered are (X1..,.. X4jX3) and (X2..,.. X4jX3) but X3 intercepts the paths X1 .._.. X4 and X2 .._.. X4. For (iv}, need to consider (X1 ..,.. X2X4j0). Since X2 is an ancestor of x4 not in xl ....__. x4 then {iv} is true. Therefore, the graph is a (X1,X410)-fragment. •\n3That is, the undirected graph associated with G has no cycles.\nUAI2001 BONET 45\nTheorem 5 Let r be a maximal consistent set with respect to AXsrec· Then, G(f) contains a (X, YJZ) fragment for all variables X, Y E X and set Z <; X.\nLemma 6 If -,(X -+> Y JZW) and -,(X -+> YWJZ), then there is an (X, YJZW)-fragment where W has no Y ancestors.\nThe proofs of Theorem 5 and Lemma 6 are in the full paper [1]. The next theorem is the main result of this section.\nTheorem 7 AXsrec is complete with respect to Tsrec·\nProof: Let r be maximal AXsrec-consistent. Let U, V E X and maximal T <; X such that -,(U-+> VIT). Let G::;: G(r) be the (U, VJT)-fragment given by The orem 5. Define the recursive model Ta with singleton Ua and 'Dx equal to the non-negative integers for all X E X, by4 { 0 Y-\nmax{X :X E Pao(Y)} if there is P s.t. P E Paa(Y), P = 0, otherwise.\nThis equation depends on the fixed G so we write Y0 when this dependency needs to be shown. By con struction and properties (i)-(iii) of fragments, Ta t= •(U -ff VIZ) and Ta t= (U -ff VJT) if (U -ff VJT). Let U be the collection of all fragments, and T the causal model with domain U and equations Y (·;G) = Y0(-) forG E U. In the rest, we show using induction that T satisfies all literals in f; i.e., T t= r.\nFirst consider all literals whose first and second com ponents are single variables. Let X, Y E X and Z � X. If •(X-+> YJZ), then there is an (X, YJZ) fragment G such that X --... Y isn't intercepted by Z. By construction, Ta I= -,(X -+> YJZ) which im plies T t= •(X-++ YJZ). Assume now (X-++ YJZ) and let G be any (U, VJT)-fragment. By definition, Z in tercepts all paths X --... Y in G, so by construction Tat= (X -++YJZ). Thus, T I= (X -ffYJZ). The next step is to show that T satisfies all literals whose first component is a single variable. Let •(X-+> YWJZ) be a such negative literal with Y E X, W � X. Without loss of generality assume that •(X -+> YJZW). By Lemma 6, there is a fragment G such that ZW doesn't intercepts X --... Y and W contains no ancestor of Y. By construction, Ta I= •(X-++ YWJZ). So, T I= ...,(X...,... YWJZ). Assume now (X -+> YWJZ) and, without loss of generality that -,(X-++ YJZ) since otherwise T t= (X -+> YWJZ) (the reader can check it using A4). Let G be an (U, VJT)-fragment such that Z doesn't intercept path X --... Y. Then, (iv)\n4 An empty max is defined to be 0.\nof Definition 4 and construction imply Ta t= (X -ff YWJZ). Thus, T I= (X-+> YWJZ). The last step is for general literals. Note that A3 and A6 imply (XW -+> YJZ) ¢:> (X -ff YJZW) & (W -+> YJZX). Therefore, by above cases, (XW-+> YJZ) if and only if T t= (XW -+> YJZ). •\nExample 3: Consider the (X1,X4J0)-fragment G in Example 2. The construction of Theorem 7 gives the model Ta:\nx1 = 0,\nx2 = 0,\nx4 = X a,\nX a { �ax{X1,X2} if Xt = 0 or X2 = 0, otherwise. We now prove that Ta satisfies •(X1 -++ X410) and all positive literals in Example 1. It is easy to check that [X1 = O,X2 = l]X4 = 0 and [X1 = l,X2 = l]X4 = 1.

We will do something similar but with sets of formulas. Thus, to each maximal consistent set r and negative literal IP E r, we assign a maximal AXsrec-COnsistent set f1 t;; r containing r.p. All such sets are then use to build fsree models that combine into a model T E free such that T 1= r. Let 1/Jo, 1/J1, . . . , '1/Jn be a fixed enumeration of all literals in C. Fix a maximal AXrec-consistent set f.

Fix a model T and let r be a set of causal relevances that hold in T; i.e., T I= r. If T E 'fsrec, then the completeness of AXsrec and Theorem 3 imply G(T) is equal to G(r' ) for some AXsrec--extension r' of r. Thus, the graph defined as\nQ(r) �r na(r'), r•\nwhere the intersection is over all AXsree-extensions of r, is an edge subgraph of G(T). Completeness is needed here in order to guarantee that every r' has a corresponding model in Tsrec· Suppose further that we can buy one of several possible information options r; ;2 r. The problem is to decide which is the best option. Let c; be the cost associated to r;. A rational approach would be to buy the set that minimizes the\npondered cost C; �r cd#(Q(r;) -Q(r)) where #G de notes the number of edges in graph G. The formula for C; considers that the benefit of the information is pro portional to the number of new edges provided by it. Note that if r; generates no new edges, then C; = oo. Similar definitions can be made when T E Tree· Ob serve that we do not claim this can be implemented in an efficient way. Nonetheless, this calculus can be integrated into other methods of structure identifica tion by using it to prune the search space; e.g., once we know -.(X --r-+ Y]Z), then the graph we are looking for must has a path X � Y not intercepted by Z.\nAnother application of the calculus is for testing whether a model is recursive or not. Since AXrec is complete with respect to Tree, then a necessary test for recursiveness is AXree-consistency. Thus, if r is not AXrec-consistent, then r corresponds to a non recursive model. An argument like this one was used in the proof of Theorem 11.\n5 Summary\nThere are three main contributions in this paper. First, it gives a finer decomposition funiq into the two subclasses 'Tsrec and Tree· This decomposition is nec essary for the formalization of causal relevance from the three-place relation (X --r-+ Y]Z), and it is useful as shown in the applications of the calculus. The sec ond contribution is the collection of axiomatizations AXuniq, AXree and AXsrec. AXuniq extends the sys tem in [6] with the three new axioms A5, AS and A9. It is a sound axiomatization with respect to the class 'Tuniq. AXrec is a stronger version of AXuniq that is sound and complete with respect to Tree· It is equal to AXuniq plus the rule RI. The axiomatization AXsrec,\na stronger version AXrec, is sound and complete with respect to Tsrec· It is equal to AXuniq plus the rule SRI. Finally, we show how the calculus of causal rel evance can be used to identify causal structure. This is a non-probabilistic approach that can be used to in fer structure from non-observational data. All other methods we know of are based on probabilistic infer ence (e.g., [9]). It would be interesting to study the similarities and difference between these approaches.\nSome open questions are if AXuniq is a complete sys tem with respect to funiq, if the collection A1-A9 is an independent set of Axioms, and which Axioms can be used to replace the RI and SRI rules.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Carlos Brito and Judea Pearl for their useful comments in a first version of this paper.
