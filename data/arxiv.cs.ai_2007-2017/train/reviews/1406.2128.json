In this paper, we consider this problem when the traffic network links are fuzzy cost. Therefore, a Physarum-type algorithm is developed to unify the Physarum network and the traffic network for taking full of advantage of Physarum Polycephalum's adaptivity in network design to solve the user equilibrium problem. Eventually, some experiments are used to test the performance of this method. The results demonstrate that our approach is competitive when compared with other existing algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 10:41:06 GMT  (329kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2128v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yang liu", "xiaoge zhang", "yong deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2128"}
