Our model is novel in that it utilizes a dynamic graphical model to jointly estimate both activity and spatial context over time based on the simultaneous use of asynchronous observations consisting of GPS measurements, and measurements from a small mountable sensor board. Joint inference is quite desirable as it has the ability to improve accuracy of the model. A key goal, however, in designing our overall system is to be able to perform accurate inference decisions while minimizing the amount of hardware an individual must wear. This minimization leads to greater comfort and flexibility, decreased power requirements and therefore increased battery life, and reduced cost. We show results indicating that our joint measurement model outperforms measurements from either the sensor board or GPS alone, using two types of probabilistic inference procedures, namely particle filtering and pruned exact inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:29:30 GMT  (931kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6869v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amarnag subramanya", "alvin raj", "jeff a bilmes", "dieter fox"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6869"}
