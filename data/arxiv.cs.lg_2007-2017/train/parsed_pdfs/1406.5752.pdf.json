      "text" : "Expectation-maximization (EM) [14], sampling methods [18], and matrix factorization [27, 35] are three algorithms commonly used to produce maximum likelihood (or maximum a posteriori (MAP)) estimates of models with latent variables/factors, and thus are used in a wide range of applications such as clustering, topic modeling, collaborative filtering, structured prediction, feature engineering, and time series analysis. However, their learning procedures rely on alternating optimization/updates between parameters and latent variables, which suffer from local optima. Hence, their quality greatly depends on initialization and on using a large number of iterations for proper convergence [34].\nThe method of moments [32, 7, 23], in contrast, solves m equations by relating the first m moments of observation x ∈ Rp to the m model parameters, and thus yields a consistent estimator with a global solution. In practice, however, sample moments usually suffer from unbearably large variance, which easily leads to the failure of final estimation, especially when m or p is large. Although recent spectral methods [10, 24, 20, 1] reduces m to 2 or 3 when estimating O(p) m parameters [2] by relating the eigenspace of lower-order moments to parameters in a matrix form up to column scale, the variance of sample moments is still sensitive to large p or data noise, which may result in poor estimation. Moreover, although spectral method using SVDs or tensor decomposition evidently simplifies learning, the computation can still be expensive for big data. In addition, recovering a parameter matrix with uncertain column scale might not be feasible for some applications.\nIn this paper, we reduce the learning in a rich class of models (e.g., matrix factorization and latent variable model) to finding the extreme rays of a conical hull from a finite set of real data points. This is obtained by applying a general separability assumption to either the data matrix in matrix factorization or the 2nd/3rd order moments in latent variable models. Separability posits that a set of n points, as rows of matrix X , can be represented by X = FXA, where the rows(bases) in XA are a\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n57 52\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 2\n2 Ju\nn 20\nsubset A ⊂ V = [n] of rows in X , which are called “anchors” and are interesting to various models when |A| = k n. This property was introduced in [15] to establish the uniqueness of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) under simplex constraints, and was later [26, 19] extended to non-negative constraints. We generalize it further to the model X = FYA for two (possibly distinct) finite sets of points X and Y , and build a new theory for the identifiability of A. This generalization enables us to apply it to more general models (ref. Table 1) besides NMF. More interestingly, it leads to a learning method with much higher tolerance to the variance of sample moments or data noise, a unique global solution, and a more interpretable model.\nAnother primary contribution of this paper is a distributed learning scheme, “divide-and-conquer anchoring (DCA)”, for finding an anchor set A such that X = FYA by solving same-type subproblems on merely O(k log k) random drawn low-dimensional (low-D) hyperplanes. Each subproblem is of the form of (XΦ) = F · (Y Φ) with random projection matrix Φ, and can easily be handled by most solvers due to the low dimension. This is based on the observation that the geometry of the original conical hull is partially preserved after a random projection. We analyze the probability of success for each sub-problem to recover part of A, and then study the number of sub-problems for recovering the whole A with high probability (w.h.p.). In particular, we propose an ultrafast non-iterative solver for sub-problems on the 2D plane, which requires computing an array of cosines and its max/min values, and thus results in learning algorithms with speedups of tens to hundreds of times. DCA improves multiple aspects of algorithm design since: 1) its idea of divide-and-conquer randomization gives rise to distributed learning that can reduce the original problem to multiple extremely low-D sub-problems that are much easier and faster to solve, and 2) it provides a fast subroutine checking if a point is covered by a conical hull, which can be embedded into other solvers.\nWe apply both the conical hull anchoring model and DCA to five learning models: Gaussian mixture models (GMM) [37], hidden Markov models (HMM) [6], latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [8], NMF [27], and subspace clustering (SC) [16]. The resulting models and algorithms show significant improvement in efficiency. On generalization performance, they consistently outperform spectral methods and matrix factorization, and are comparable to or even better than EM and sampling.\nIn the following, we will first generalize the separability assumption and minimum conical hull problem risen from NMF in § 2, and then show how to reduce more general learning models to a (general) minimum conical hull problem in § 3. § 4 presents a divide-and-conquer learning scheme that can quickly locate the anchors of the conical hull by solving the same problem in multiple extremely low-D spaces. Comprehensive experiments and comparison can be found in § 5."

      "heading" : "2 General Separability Assumption and Minimum Conical Hull Problem",
      "text" : "The original separability property [15] is defined on the convex hull of a set of data points, namely that each point can be represented as a convex combination of certain subsets of vertices that define the convex hull. Later works on separable NMF [26, 19] extend it to the conical hull case, which replaced convex with conical combinations. Given the definition of (convex) cone and conical hull, the separability assumption can be defined both geometrically and algebraically. Definition 1 (Cone & conical hull). A (convex) cone is a non-empty convex set that is closed with respect to conical combinations of its elements. In particular, cone(R) can be defined by its k generators (or rays) R = {ri}ki=1 such that\ncone(R) = { ∑k\ni=1 αiri | ri ∈ R,αi ∈ R+ ∀i}. (1)\nIn the following, let X be a matrix with n columns and indexed by the integers [n], and XA be a subset of columns for A ⊆ [n]. Definition 2 (Separability assumption). All the data points in X are covered in a finitely generated and pointed cone whose generators are a subset A ⊆ [n] of data points. That is,\n∃A ⊆ [n] s.t. ∀i ∈ [n], Xi ∈ cone (XA) , XA = {xi}i∈A. (2) An equivalent algebraic form is X = FXA,ΠF = [ Ik F ′ ] , where |A| = k, Ik is a k-by-k identity\nmatrix, F ′ ∈ R(n−k)×k+ , and Π is a row permutation matrix.\nThe above algebraic form gives rise to an NMF model X = FXA. The cone cone(XA) is finitely generated because all the elements in X are conical combinations of a finite set XA. It is also pointed\nbecause its non-negativity does not allow it containing both x and −x. According to basic rules [30], a finitely generated and pointed cone C possesses a finite and unique set of extreme rays R, and C = cone(R) is the conical hull generated by these extreme rays R. When only one point in X is on each extreme ray, the separability assumption guarantees the uniqueness of NMF solution XA and F . Moreover, when X consists of real data points, they are often in practice interpretable since they constitute the “essential” set that uses actual data to express itself rather than artificial basis/factors.\nBased on separability assumption in Definition 2, we define the minimum conical hull problem, and offer several formulations for how it can be solved, including a novel formulation that utilizes submodular optimization. Each of these, in later sections of the paper, will be compared in various ways against the baseline methods established in this section. Definition 3 (Minimum Conical Hull Problem). Given a X having an index set V = [n] of its rows, minimum conical hull problem finds the subset of rows that define the same cone as all the rows. That is, find A ∈ 2V that solves:\nmin A⊂V\n|A|, s.t., cone(XA) = cone(X). (3)\nwhere cone(XA) is the cone induced by the rows A of X .\nWe note that without the separability assumption, there is no non-trivial set A ⊂ V that is feasible. As mentioned above, there is a weakly polynomial time algorithm that in the non-negative case solves the problem via backward removal. Definition 4. A nonnegative matrix XA is simplicial if no row in XA can be represented in the convex hull of the remaining rows in XA.\nLemma 1 (Lemma 5.3 from [5]). If a nonnegative matrix X has a separable factorization WXA of inner-dimension at most k then there is one in which XA is simplicial.\nIn the proof of this lemma, Arora proposes a procedure that starting at A = V , one-by-one, removes rows violating the simpliciality of XA. This is using linear programming, where for each row in XA we test if it can be represented by convex combination of remaining rows. The rows that cannot be represented by other rows are selected as the “loners” (anchors). Theorem 1 (Theorem 5.4 in [5]). There is an algorithm that runs in time [weakly] polynomial in n, m, and k and given a matrix X outputs a separable factorization with inner dimension at most k (if one exists).\nThe simplicial XA obtained by the algorithm is the solution of our minimum conical hull problem. Theorem 2. A simplicial XA satisfying X = FXA, Fi,j ≥ 0 ∀{i, j} is the solution of (3). Such XA can be achieved by Arora’s algorithm that runs in time polynomial in n, m, and k.\nProof. It is easy to verify that XA obtained by Arora’s exact algorithm [5] is a feasible solution fulfilling the constraint in (8). However, suppose (for contradiction) XA does not define the minimum conical hull, i.e., there exists a simplicial XB with |B| < |A| and X = F ′ XB . So we have\nXA = CXB , XB = DXA → XA = (CD)XA. (4)\nIf U = CD, for arbitrary row XjA in XA, we have\nXjA = U j \\jXA\\j + U j jX j A. (5)\nWe cannot make U jj = 1∀j, because in this case CD = I|A|, which leads to contradiction with the fact that CD has inner dimension of |B|. Therefore, we can always find at least one j such that U j\\j is not all-zero vector and\nXjA = U j\\jXA\\j\n1− U jj , (6)\nwhich violates the constraint that XA is simplicial and thus causes contradiction. So we cannot find a simplicial XB with |B| < |A| and X = W ′ XB , which implies A is the solution of minimum conical hull problem (8).\nLastly, we see how Equation (3) can be seen as a submodular cover problem [38]. Define cover(XA) to be the size of the largest set B ⊆ V of rows of X that lies within cone(XA). That is,\ncover(XA) = |{v ∈ V : ∃f ∈ R|A|+ with Xv = f>XA}|. (7)\nDefinition 5. For a nonnegative matrix X with a ground set V of all its row indexes, the minimum conical hull problem is to solve:\nmin A⊂V\n|A|, s.t., cover(A) = cover(V ). (8)\nIt can be verified that the constraint in Definition 5 equals to the constraint to F in Definition 2, and that f(A) = cover(XA∪I), where XI is any set of linearly independent row vectors, is submodular [17]. Therefore, we can apply efficient greedy algorithm for submodular cover to the minimum conical hull problem with approximation guarantee."

      "text" : "By generalizing the separability assumption, we obtain a general minimum conical hull problem that can reduce more general learning models besides NMF, e.g., latent variable models and matrix factorization, to finding a set of “anchors” on the extreme rays of a conical hull. At first, we only need F to be non-negative, and do not require XA or X to be non-negative. Because a pointed cone cone(XA) after rotation is still a pointed cone with unchanged anchor set A. Secondly, to ensure cone(XA) to be finitely generated, we only need the points in XA to be selected from a finite set, which could be another set Y and is not necessary to be X itself. Lastly, extra constraint can be imposed to the coefficients F ′ to encourage particular structures among data points. Definition 6 (General separability assumption). All the n data points(rows) in X are covered in a finitely generated and pointed cone (i.e., if x ∈ cone(YA) then −x 6∈ cone(YA)) whose generators form a subset A ⊆ [m] of data points in Y such that @i 6= j, YAi = a · YAj . Geometrically, it says\n∀i ∈ [n], Xi ∈ cone (YA) , YA = {yi}i∈A. (9) An equivalent algebraic form is X = FYA,ΠF = [ Ik F ′ ] , where |A| = k, Ik is a k-by-k identity\nmatrix, F ′ ∈ S ⊆ R(n−k)×k+ , and Π is a row permutation matrix.\nWhen X = Y and S = R(n−k)×k+ , it degenerates to the original separability assumption given in [3]. We generalize the minimum conical hull problem from [3]. Under the general separability assumption, it aims to find the anchor set A from the points in Y rather than X . Definition 7 (General Minimum Conical Hull Problem). Given a finite set of points X and a set Y having an index set V = [m] of its rows, the general minimum conical hull problem finds the subset of rows in Y that define a super-cone for all the rows in X . That is, find A ∈ 2V that solves:\nmin A⊂V\n|A|, s.t., cone(YA) ⊇ cone(X). (10)\nwhere cone(YA) is the cone induced by the rows A of Y .\nWhen X = Y , it degenerates to the original minimum conical hull problem defined in [3]. A critical question of the general one is whether/when the solution A is unique. When X = Y and X = FXA, which is the case for matrix factorization and latent variable model with nonzero off-diagonal entries in D in § 3.3, by following the analysis of the separability assumption in [3],we can prove that A is unique and identifiable given X . However, when X 6= Y and X = FYA, it is clear that there could be multiple legal choices of A (e.g., there could be multiple layers of conical hulls containing a set of points X in the center). Fortunately, when the rows of Y are rank-one matrices after vectorization (concatenating all columns to a long vector), which is the common case in most latent variable models with diagonal D in § 3.3, A can be uniquely determined if the number of rows in X exceeds 2. Lemma 2 (Identifiability). IfX = FYA with the additional structure Ys = vec(Osi ⊗Osj ) whereOi is a pi × k matrix and Osi is its sth column, under the general separability assumption in Definition 6, two (non-identical) rows in X are sufficient to exactly recover the unique A, Oi and Oj .\nProof. Two non-identical rows of X can be represented as two sum mixtures of rank-one matrices in YA with weights a 6= b, i.e.,\nX1 = vec( ∑k s=1 a\n(s)Osi ⊗Osj ) = vec(OiDiag(a)OTj ), X2 = vec( ∑k s=1 b (s)Osi ⊗Osj ) = vec(OiDiag(b)OTj ). (11)\nIn the following proof, we temporarily use X1 and X2 to denote themselves before vectorization. Given SVD of X1 as X1 = UiΣUTj , Oi and Oj can be represented in the following forms.\nOi = UiΣ 1/2VDiag(a−1/2), Oj = UjΣ 1/2V −TDiag(a1/2). (12)\nNote the decomposition of X1 in (11) will stay the same when we change V in (12) to any other non-singular matrix. Thus a single row in X cannot uniquely identify Oi and Oj . By further given X2, we have\nΣ−1/2UTi X2UjΣ −1/2 = Σ−1/2UTi OiDiag(b)O T j UjΣ −1/2 = VDiag(b./a)V −1. (13)\nThe second equality is obtained by applying (12). Let the (unique) eigendecomposition of VDiag(b./a)V −1 to be WΛWT , we have V = WDiag(c). Substituting it into (12) yields\nOi = UiΣ 1/2WDiag(c · / √ a), Oj = UjΣ 1/2W−TDiag( √ a · /c). (14)\nTherefore, we can determine each element s ∈ A by checking if ∃t, Ys = vec(Osi ⊗ Osj ) = vec [ (UiΣ 1/2W )(t) ⊗ (UjΣ1/2W−T )(t) ]\nfor each s ∈ [n] in the ground set. Since all the quantities in the rank-one matrix on the right hand side is uniquely fixed for each t ∈ [k], each s selected from the ground set is unique.\nIn applications such as latent variable model, as stated in § 3.3, the set of n rank-one matrices in Y is generated by computing xi ⊗ xj for n data points or observations, where xi is the ith group of features. The general minimum conical hull problem then equals to selecting k data points. Since in this case the columns of Oi and Oj are respectively estimated as xi and xj of the k selected data points, in order to further guarantee the uniqueness of the k selected data points rather than only the k out products xi ⊗ xj , we need to avoid the case when xi and xj in two different data points generate the same xi ⊗ xj . According to (14), we have to assume @{s ∈ A, t 6= s, δ 6= 0} satisfying {xi}t = δ{xi}s and {xj}t = {xj}s/δ, where {xi}s denotes feature xi for sth data point. Note this assumption is much weaker than limiting {x}t 6= δ{x}s in original separable NMF. In above proof, we need a 6= b to ensure the identifiability of A. In practice, this inequality can be achieved by drawing random vector η from a continuous distribution, as we did in (16) within § 3. Then the inequality holds with probability 1."

      "text" : "Besides NMF, we consider more general matrix factorization (MF) models that can operate on negative features and specify a complicated structure of F . The MF X = FW is a deterministic latent variable model where F and W are deterministic latent factors. By assigning a likelihood p(Xi,j |Fi, (WT )j) and priors p(F ) and p(W ), its optimization model can be derived from maximum likelihood or MAP estimate. The resulting object is usually a loss function `(·) of X − FW plus regularization terms for F and W , i.e., min `(X,FW ) +RF (F ) +RW (W ).\nSimilar to separable NMF, minimizing the objective of general MF can be reduced to a minimum conical hull problem that selects the subset A with X = FXA. In this setting, RW (W ) = ∑k i=1 g(Wi) where g(w) = 0 if w = Xi for some i and g(w) = ∞ otherwise. This is equivalent to applying a prior p(Wi) with finite support set on the rows of X to each row of W . In addition, the regularization of F can be transformed to geometric constraints between points in X and in XA. Since Fi,j is the conical combination weight of XAj in recovering Xi, a large Fi,j intuitively indicates a small angle between XAj and Xi, and vice verse. For example, the sparse and graph Laplacian prior for rows of F in subspace clustering can be reduced to “cone clustering” finding A."

      "heading" : "3.2 Example: Subspace Clustering",
      "text" : "Subspace clustering (SC) assumes that the data points in each cluster exist in a low-Dimensional subspace. The subspaces defining different clusters are assumed to be distinguishable, e.g., with large principle angles between each other [36]. SC outperforms traditional clustering methods in various tasks such as motion segmentation. Most existing subspace clustering methods [16, 36], relies on spectral clustering to the sparse representations of data points, which are obtained by finding a sparse C with diag(C) = 0 in model X = CX . This usually requires a series of time costly lasso-type optimization. Then (spectral) clustering to rows of C guarantees to provide clustering labels which can lead to reliable estimation of the k subspaces [36].\nUnder the general separability assumption, SC model can be reduced to general minimum conical hull problem X = FXA once we impose an additional block diagonal constraint F ′ ∈ S to the nonnegative F ′ (S in Definition 6), in particular, ΠF = [Diag(Ik1 , . . . , Ikk); Diag(F ′ 1, . . . , F ′ k)], where F ′i ∈ R (ni−ki)×ki + , ∑k i=1 ni = n, and Π is a row-permutation matrix. So the ni points in cluster i have coefficient matrix Fi in the subspace spanned by ki “anchors” associated with Iki in\nΠF , i.e., ∀i ∈ [k], Xi = FiXAi ,ΠiFi = [ Iki F ′i ] , where Xi ∈ Rni×p are the points in cluster i, and\nA = ⊎k i=1Ai, the disjoint union of all the anchors from the k clusters. Hence, given clustering labels, our method is equivalent to applying a minimum conical hull problem model to points in each cluster.\nOur goal is to find out the k groups of anchors and simultaneously separate the points covered inside the associated k cones {cone(XAi)}i∈[k]. In other words, we reduce SC to a “cone clustering” problem separate k cones of data points. Each cone covers all the points in one cluster, and the faces spanned by its anchors separate these points from those covered by other cones.\nSeparable NMF is a special case of separable SC when k = 1. When k > 1, the cone clustering problem might be difficult to solve in high-dim space. But by applying the DCA scheme proposed in the next section, we will show that this problem can be reduced to several cone clustering problems on low-D hyperplanes, each can be solved by efficient existing clustering method."

      "heading" : "3.3 Latent Variable Model",
      "text" : "Different from deterministic MF, we build a system of equations from the moments of probabilistic latent variable models, and then formulate it as a general minimum conical hull problem, rather than directly solve it. Let the generalization model be h ∼ p(h;α) and x ∼ p(x|h; θ), where h is a latent variable, x stands for observation, and {α, θ} are parameters. In a variety of graphical models such as GMMs and HMMs, we need to model conditional independence between groups of features. This is also known as the multi-view assumption. W.l.o.g., we assume that x is composed of three groups(views) of features {xi}i∈[3] such that ∀i 6= j, xi ⊥ xj |h. We further assume the dimension k of h is smaller than pi, the dimension of xi. Since the goal is learning {α, θ}, decomposing the moments of x rather than the data matrix X can help us get rid of the latent variable h and thus avoid\nalternating minimization between {α, θ} and h. When E(xi|h) = hTOTi (linearity assumption), the second and third order moments can be written in the form of matrix operator.{\nE (xi ⊗ xj) = E[E(xi|h)⊗ E(xj |h)] = OiE(h⊗ h)OTj , E (xi ⊗ xj · 〈η, xl〉) = Oi [E(h⊗ h⊗ h)×3 (Olη)]OTj ,\n(15)\nwhere A×n U denotes the n-mode product of a tensor A by a matrix U , ⊗ is the outer product, and the operator parameter η can be any vector. We will mainly focus on the models in which {α, θ} can be exactly recovered from conditional mean vectors {Oi}i∈[3] and E(h⊗ h)1, because they cover most popular models such as GMM and HMM in real applications.\nThe left hand sides (LHS) of both equations in (15) can be directly estimated from training data, while their right hand sides (RHS) can be written in a unified matrix form OiDOTj with Oi ∈ Rpi×k and D ∈ Rk×k. By using different η, we can obtain 2 ≤ q ≤ pl + 1 independent equations, which compose a system of equations for Oi and Oj . Given the LHS, we can obtain the column spaces of Oi and Oj , which respectively equal to the column and row space of OiDOTj , a low-rank matrix when pi > k. In order to further determine Oi and Oj , our discussion falls into two types of D.\nWhen D is a diagonal matrix. This happens when ∀i 6= j,E(hihj) = 0. A common example is that h is a label/state indicator such that h = ei for class/state i, e.g., h in GMM and HMM. In this case, the two D matrices in RHS of (15) are{\nE(h⊗ h) = Diag( −−−→ E(h2i )), E(h⊗ h⊗ h)×3 (Olη) = Diag( −−−→ E(h3i ) ·Olη),\n(16)\nwhere −−−→ E(hti) = [E(ht1), . . . ,E(htk)]. So either matrix in LHS of (15) can be written as a sum of k rank-one matrices, i.e., ∑k s=1 σ (s)Osi ⊗Osj , where Osi is the sth column of Oi.\nThe general separability assumption posits that the set of k rank-one basis matrices constructing the RHS of (15) is a unique subset A ⊆ [n] of the n samples of xi ⊗ xj constructing the left hand sides, i.e., Osi ⊗Osj = [xi ⊗ xj ]As = XAs,i ⊗XAs,j , the outer product of xi and xj in (As)th data point. Therefore, by applying q − 1 different η to (15), we obtain the system of q equations in the following form, where Y t is the estimate of the LHS of tth equation from training data.\n∀t ∈ [q], Y (t) = k∑ s=1 σt,s[xi ⊗ xj ]As ⇔ [vec(Y (t))]t∈[q] = σ[vec(Xt,i ⊗Xt,j)]t∈A. (17)\nThe right equation in (17) is an equivalent matrix representation of the left one. Its LHS is a q × pipj matrix, and its RHS is the product of a q × k matrix σ and a k × pipj matrix. By letting X ← [vec(Y (t))]t∈[q], F ← σ and Y ← [vec(Xt,i ⊗ Xt,j)]t∈[n], we can fit (17) to X = FYA in Definition 6. Therefore, learning {Oi}i∈[3] is reduced to selecting k rank-one matrices from {Xt,i ⊗ Xt,j}t∈[n] indexed by A, and defining the extreme rays of a conical hull covering the q matrices {Y (t)}t∈[q]. Given the anchor set A, we have Ôi = XA,i and Ôj = XA,j by assigning real data points indexed by A to the columns of Oi and Oj . Given Oi and Oj , σ can be estimated by solving (17). In many models, a few rows of σ are sufficient to recover α.\nIn (17), the dimension of each matrix after vectorization is pipj . In practice, this could lead to computational burden. Moreover, real data could suffers from missing features, which make computing all entries of Xt,i ⊗Xt,j impossible. However, thanks to the matrix completion research [9, 12], when k min{pi, pj}, we can retain merely m = O(max{pi, pj}k log2(pi + pj)) pipj entries in the vectorization of each matrix from {Y (t)}t∈[q] and {Xt,i ⊗Xt,j}t∈[n] in (17). W.h.p., the true A can still be successfully recovered from such partial information.\nWhen D is a symmetric matrix with nonzero off-diagonal entries. This happens in “admixture” models, e.g., h can be a general binary vector h ∈ {0, 1}k or a vector on the probability simplex, and\n1Note our method can also handle more complex models that violate the linearity assumption and need higher order moments for parameter estimation. By replacing xi in (15) with vec(xi⊗n), the vectorization of the nth tensor power of xi, Oi can contain nth order moments for p(xi|h; θ). However, since higher order moments are either not necessary or difficult to estimate due to high sample complexity, we will not study them in this paper.\nthe conditional mean E(xi|h) is a mixture of columns in Oi. The most well known example is LDA, in which each document is generated by multiple topics.\nWe apply the general separability assumption by only using the first equation in (15), and treating the matrix in its LHS as X in X = FXA. When the data are extremely sparse, which is common in text data, selecting the rows of the denser second order moment as bases is a more reasonable and effective assumption compared to sparse data points. In this case, the p rows of F contain k unit vectors {ei}i∈[k]. This leads to a natural assumption of “anchor word” for LDA [4]. When the data is not sure to be sparse, as we will show in the example of Kalman filter, we apply a “bilateral separability assumption” to both matrices on LHS of (15). It is weaker than the one used for diagonal D case, but much stronger than the one used for above LDA case. In particular, we apply the general separability assumption X = FYA to both the matrix on LHS of each equation in (15) and its transpose, i.e., the k column of Oi are selected from n instances of xi, while the k columns of Oj are selected from n instances of xj . In theory, it is hard to analyze the uniqueness of Oi and Oj under mild condition in this case, but it works pretty well in practice, and usually does ensure unique solution."

Under multi-view assumption x = {xi}i∈[3] with ∀i 6= j, xi ⊥ xj |h, MM generates an observation x by firstly drawing a label indicator h ∼ σ ∈ ∆k−1 from {ei}i∈[k] and then drawing features of different views xi ∼ p(xi| ∑k j=1 hjθ j i ) independently.

Since h ∈ {ei}i∈[k], E(hihj) = 0, which implies the two D matrices are diagonal. So GMM falls into the first type of latent variable model in § 3.3. By (15) and (17), given data matrix X where Xt,i is view i of data point t and is the tth row of Xi, learning GMM can be reduced to solving a general conical hull problem in the form of X = FYA by letting\nX ← 1 n\n[ vec[XT1 X2]; vec[X T 1 Diag(X3ηt)X2]t∈[q] ] , Y ← [vec(Xt,1 ⊗Xt,2)]t∈[n]. (18)\nIn practical algorithm, we can further apply the “matrix completion” trick at the end of § 3.3 to the columns of X and Y in (18) by randomly sampling a subset Ω ⊆ [p1]× [p2], i.e.,\nX ← 1 n\n[ vec[(XT1 X2)Ω]; vec[(X T 1 Diag(X3ηt)X2)Ω]t∈[q] ] , Y ← [vec((Xt,1 ⊗Xt,2))Ω]t∈[n].\n(19) The identifiability of A in Lemma 2 still holds w.h.p. in this case. However, the resulting model requires much less computations than the “full matrix” model.\nEmpirically (and shown in § 5), we find out that our method performs appealingly even when applying the 3-view assumption to data that do not have multi-view features by randomly splitting all features into 3 groups. Obviously, some feature correlation information is ignored in this case, but the rest correlations between views captured by our method are usually sufficient to produce a reliable estimation of the parameters. In addition, the Gaussian distribution assumption is only a special case satisfying the linearity assumption E(xi|h) = hTOTi made in our model. So DCA can be actually applied to more general mixture models.\n2However, as we mentioned below (15), it is possible to recover covariance or higher moments for each p(xi|θji ) by using higher order sample moments of xi."

HMM can be depicted as a Markov chain of hidden states {ht}t∈[T ] (ht = ei if the state is i), each ht generates the observation xt at time t. Markov chain property implies ∀j 6= t, xt ⊥ xj |ht, so multi-view assumption holds. The generalization process is h1 ∼ π ∈ ∆k−1, ht ∼ Tht−1 ∈ ∆k−1 and xt ∼ p(xt|ht, O), where T ∈ Rk×k is the transition matrix such that Ti,j = p(ht = ei|ht−1 = ej), and O ∈ Rp×k is the emission matrix such that E(xt|ht) = hTt OT . This is in consistency with our linearity assumption. Normally, the number of states k p, the dimension of observation x. Given one or several sequences of observations {xt}t∈[T ], the goal of learning HMM is to estimate parameters {O, T}. HMM can be converted to a special case of MM by integrating out the two hidden states before and after the current one. In particular, w.l.o.g., for each triple of observations {x1, x2, x3} and the corresponding hidden states {h1, h2, h3}, let h1 ∼ π, by integrating out h1 and h2, we have [2] E(x2|h2) = hT2 OT → hT2 OT2 , h2 ∼ Tπ, E(x1|h2) = ∑ h1 E(x1|h1) · p(h2|h1)p(h1)p(h2) = h T 2 [ ODiag(π)TTDiag((Tπ)−1) ]T → hT2 OT1 , E(x3|h2) = ∑ h3\nE(x3|h3)p(h3|h2) = hT2 [OT ]T → hT2 OT3 .

General separability assumption posits that the conditional means E(x2|h2) and E(x3|h2), i.e., the columns in O and OT , are selected from real instances of observations. So we can fit the problem of learning emission matrix O in HMM to a conical hull problem X = FYA by using the same formulas (18) or (19) for GMM.\nWe will show how the transition matrix T can be immediately recovered given the anchor set A in § 4."

Hence, when distributions p(wt) and p(vt) are symmetric, we have linearity E(ht|ht−1) = Tht−1 and E(xt|ht) = hTt O\nT , which are analogous to HMM. Similar to HMM, the multi-view or conditional independence assumption automatically holds for such Markov typed model, and it is also reasonable to assume that k p. The goal of learning is to estimate {O, T} and the distribution parameters Θ for p(wt) and p(vt).\nCompared to HMM, the only difference here is that h changes from disjoint discrete state to kD continuous variable.

This falls into the second type of D discussed in § 3.5. However, since the observations are usually not sparse, different from LDA in § 3.7 where we directly apply original separability assumption to the moment matrices, we apply a “bilateral separability assumption” to both matrices on LHS of (24). It is weaker than the one used for diagonal D case, but much stronger than the one used for LDA case. In particular, we apply the general separability assumption to both the matrix on LHS of each equation in (24) and its transpose, i.e., the k column of O are selected from n instances of x2, while the k columns of OT are selected from n instances of x3.

It generates the jth word xj ∈ {ei}i∈[p] in a document by firstly drawing a topic proportion h ∼ Dir(α) (Dirichlet distribution with parameter α = {αi}i∈[k]) for the document, then drawing a topic zj ∼ h from {ei}i∈[k] with associated probability β = zTj OT over p words in vocabulary, and drawing word xj ∼ β at last. The topic probability matrix O stores the conditional probabilities Oi,j = p(x = ei|z = ej). Given h, different words in a document are generated independently, so the multi-view assumption ∀j 6= t, xt ⊥ xj |h holds. Since E(xj |h) = ∑ z E(xj |z)p(z|h) = hTOT , the linearity assumption is satisfied on LDA. Normally, the number of topics k p, the number of words in vocabulary.

In this section, we will focus on a novel distributed learning scheme that spans different dimensions in developing algorithms for X = FYA. The proposed divide-and-conquer anchoring (DCA) in Algorithm 1 decomposes the conical hull problem to multiple (much easier) sub-problems in extremely low dimensions, which can be solved in parallel. The first DCA algorithm was proposed in [39] only for separable NMF, but this paper will largely extend the idea to much richer class of problems and algorithm designs.\nThe key insights of DCA come from two observations on the geometry of the convex cone. First, projecting a conical hull to a lower-D hyperplane partially preserves its geometry. This enables us to distribute the original problem to a few much smaller sub-problems, each handled by a solver to minimum conical hull problem. Secondly, there exists an ultrafast anchoring algorithm for subproblem on 2D plane, which only picks two anchor points based on their angles to an axis without iterative optimization or greedy pursuit. This results in a significantly efficient DCA algorithm that can be solely used, or embedded as a subroutine checking if a point is covered in a conical hull."

      "text" : "Due to the convexity of cone, a low-D projection of a conical hull is still a conical hull that covers the projections of the same points covered in the original conical hull, and generated by the projections of a subset of anchors on the extreme rays of the original conical hull. Lemma 3. For arbitrary point x ∈ cone(YA) ⊂ Rp, where A is the index set of the k anchors (generators) selected from Y , for any Φ ∈ Rp×d with d ≤ p, we have\n∃Ã ⊆ A : xΦ ∈ cone(YÃΦ), (28) Since merely a subset of A remains as anchors after projection, solving a minimum conical hull problem on a single low-D hyperplane rarely returns all the anchors in A. However, the whole set A can be recovered from the anchors detected on multiple low-D hyperplanes. By sampling the projection matrix Φ from a random ensemble M, it can be proved that w.h.p. solving only s = O(ck log k) sub-problems are sufficient to find all anchors in A. This is the bound for the worst case, i.e., the constant c only changes with the probability that the most “flat” anchor on the conical hull surface is still an anchor on the low-D hyperplane after projection. However, it is interesting that when the anchor is too “flat”, it is very close to the face spanned by its adjacent anchors, and thus the failure of detecting it still leads to a sufficiently similar conical hull. In other words, this property indicates robustness to losing unimportant anchors.\nAlgorithm 1 DCA(X,Y, k,M) Input: Two sets of points (rows) X ∈ Rn×p and Y ∈ Rm×p in matrix forms (ref. Table 1 to see X and Y for different models), number of latent factors/variables k, random matrix ensemble M; Output: Anchor set A ⊆ [m] such that ∀i ∈ [n], Xi ∈ cone(YA); Divide Step (in parallel): for i = 1→ s := O(k log k) do\nRandomly draw a matrix Φ ∈ Rp×d from M; Solve sub-problem such as Ãt = MCH(XΦ, Y Φ) by any solver, e.g., (37);\nend for Conquer Step: ∀i ∈ [m], compute ĝ(Yi) = (1/s) ∑s t=1 1Ãt(Yi); Return A as index set of the k points with the largest ĝ(Yi).\nFor the special case of NMF when X = FXA, the above result was proved in [39]. However, the analysis cannot be trivially extended to the general conical hull problem when X = FYA (see Left plot of Figure 1). A critical reason is that the converse of Lemma 3 does not hold: the uniqueness of the anchor set Ã on low-D hyperplane could be violated, because non-anchors in Y may have non-zero probability to be projected as low-D anchors. Fortunately, we can achieve a unique Ã by defining a “minimal conical hull” on a low-D hyperplane. Then Proposition 1 reveals when w.h.p such Ã is a subset of A.\nDefinition 8 (Minimal conical hull). Given two sets of points(rows) X and Y , the conical hull spanned by anchors (generators) YA is the minimal conical hull covering all points in X iff\n∀{i, j, s} ∈ { i, j, s | i ∈ AC = [m] \\A, j ∈ A, s ∈ [n], Xs ∈ cone(YA) ∩ cone(Yi∪(A\\j)) } (29)\nwe have X̂sYi > X̂sYj , where x̂y denotes the angle between two vectors x and y. The solution of minimal conical hull is denoted by A = MCH(X,Y ).\nIt is easy to verify that the minimal conical hull is unique, and the general minimum conical hull problem X = FYA under general separability assumption (which leads to the identifiability of A) is a special case of A = MCH(X,Y ). In DCA, on each low-D hyperplane Hi, the associated sub-problem aims to find the anchor set Ãi = MCH(XΦi, Y Φi). The following proposition gives the probability of Ãi ⊆ A in a sub-problem solution. Proposition 1 (Probability of success in sub-problem). As defined in the right plot of Figure 1, Ai ∈ A signifies an anchor point in YA, Ci ∈ X signifies a point in X ∈ Rn×p, Bi ∈ AC signifies a non-anchor point in Y ∈ Rm×p, the green ellipse marks the intersection hyperplane between cone(YA) and the unit sphere Sp−1, the superscript ·′ denotes the projection of a point on the intersection hyperplane. Define d-dim (d ≤ p) hyperplanes {Hi}i∈[4] such that A′3A′2 ⊥ H1, A ′ 1A ′ 2 ⊥ H2, B′1A′2 ⊥ H3, B′1C ′1 ⊥ H4, let α = Ĥ1H2 be the angle between hyperplanes\nH1 and H2, β = Ĥ3H4 be the angle between H3 and H4. If H with associated projection matrix Φ ∈ Rp×d is a d-dim hyperplane uniformly drawn from the Grassmannian manifold Gr(d, p), and Ã = MCH(XΦ, Y Φ) is the solution of minimal conical hull problem MCH(XΦ, Y Φ), we have\nPr(B1 ∈ Ã) = β\n2π ,Pr(A2 ∈ Ã) = α− β 2π . (30)\nProof. This proposition can be immediately proved by using the right plot of Figure 1. When rotating H from H1 to H2 by angle α, A2 will be identified as an anchor point of the minimal conical hull, except when H is between H4 and H3, in which region the non-anchor point B1 will be identified as an anchor point. Since the probability of being anchor point is proportional to the corresponding angle, we have Pr(B1 ∈ Ã) = β/(2π) and Pr(A2 ∈ Ã) = (α− β)/(2π).\nIt can be further verified that the angles α and β can be computed from the data points shown in the plot such that\nα = arccos ( (A′2 −A′1)T (A′2 −A′3) ‖A′2 −A′1‖‖A′2 −A′3‖ ) , β = arccos ( (B′1 −A′2)T (B′1 − C ′1) ‖B′1 −A′2‖‖B′1 − C ′1‖ ) . (31)\nThus α and β can be computed as constants for specific {A1, A2, A3, B1, C1}. Remarks:\nIt is obvious that a large Pr(A2 ∈ Ã)− Pr(B1 ∈ Ã) = (α− 2β)/(2π) leads to a large probability for the success of a sub-problem in recovering a subset of A, i.e., Ã ⊆ A. The robustness to unimportant “flat” anchors still holds for this general model. When increasing an interior angle associated to vertex A′2 of the polygon on the green intersection hyperplane, A2 turns to be a “flat” anchor, and angle α in the right plot of Figure 1 will become small, so does the probability of detecting A2 as anchor on a low-D hyperplane. The above proof also indicates robustness to data noise. When a non-anchor point’s projection on the intersection hyperplane B′i is close to the polygon defined by all vertexes A′i, the probability of Bi to be falsely identified as a anchor in a sub-problem will increase. But since Bi is close to the true conical hull, such false non-anchor point still leads to a good approximation of the true conical hull. Therefore, even our analysis aims at precisely recovery of A under noiseless assumption of data points, failure in recovering A can still provide a good approximate of cone(YA).\nAlthough Proposition 1 generally assumes that Φ is uniformly drawn from a Grassmannian manifold, empirically we can sample Φ from a rich class of random matrix ensembles M, e.g., Gaussian random matrix ensemble, the ensemble composed of standard unit vectors ei (i.e., random feature selection) or real data vectors, and various sparse random matrix ensemble, which can bring evident acceleration to projection XΦ and Y Φ.\nAccording to Proposition 1, when α > 2β for all tuples {A1, A2, A3, B1, C1}, the k points in Y with the largest Pr(i ∈ Ã) compose the unique true anchor set A. Since Pr(i ∈ Ã) cannot be exactly known, DCA compares its unbiased estimator ĝ(Yi) = (1/s) ∑s t=1 1Ãt(Yi) of all points Yi in Y , where the number of sub-problems s is the sample size of the estimator. Therefore, by using Chernoff bound, we can obtain the probability bound for the success of DCA in finding the true A. Theorem 3 (Probability bound). Following the same notations in Proposition 1, suppose p∗∗ = min{A1,A2,A3,B1,C1}(α − 2β) ≥ c/k > 0. It holds with probability at least 1− k exp ( − cs3k ) that DCA successfully identifies all the k anchor points in A, where s is the number of sub-problems solved in DCA.\nProof. We introduce two binary random variables ξti = 1Ãt(Ai) and κ t j = 1Ãt(Bj) indicating whether Ai ∈ Ãt and Bj ∈ Ãt, respectively. According to Proposition 1, we have E(ξit) = Pr(Ai ∈ Ãt) = α− β,E(κ j t ) = Pr(Bj ∈ Ãt) = β. (32)\nDCA compares ĝ(Ai) and ĝ(Bj), i.e.,\nĝ(Ai) = 1\ns s∑ t=1 ξti , ĝ(Bj) = 1 s s∑ t=1 κtj . (33)\nThe true anchor Ai is identified as an anchor by DCA in the conquer step iff ĝ(Ai) > max Bj ĝ(Bj). By applying Chernoff bound to random variable ĝ(Ai) − ĝ(Bj) (randomness is due to random hyperplane H), for any δ ∈ [0, 1], Ai and Bj , we have\nPr ( s∑ t=1 (ξti − κtj) < (1− δ)sp∗i ) ≤ exp ( −δ 2sp∗i 2 + δ ) , (34)\nwhere p∗i = min Bj (α− 2β).\nLet δ = 1 and f(Ai) = ĝ(Ai)−max Bj ĝ(Bj), by (33), we have Pr(f(Ai) = 0) ≤ exp ( −sp ∗ i\n3\n) . (35)\nThis yields\nPr( min Ai∈A\nf(Ai) > 0) = 1− Pr(∪Ai∈Af(Ai) = 0) ≥ 1− ∑ Ai∈A Pr(f(Ai) = 0)\n≥ 1− ∑ Ai∈A exp ( − sp ∗ i 3 ) ≥ 1− k exp ( − sp ∗∗ 3 ) .\n(36)\nSince p∗∗ = minAi p ∗ i ≥ c/k, this completes the proof.\nGiven Theorem 3, we can immediately achieve the following corollary about the number of subproblems that guarantee success of DCA in finding A. Corollary 1 (Number of sub-problems). With probability 1 − δ, DCA can correctly recover the anchor set A by solving Ω( 3kc log k δ ) sub-problems.\nWhen k p, i.e., the number of latent variables/factors are much less than the features or dimension of data, which is common in many learning models, DCA can learn the model parameters by solving an extremely small number of sub-problems in parallel, no matter what solver chosen for sub-problem. Thus it provides a significantly efficient learning scheme.\nRemarks:\nIt is worth noting that although DCA uses random projection to reduce the problem size, it is different from the random projection methods based on Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma [22] or its variants. Because DCA allows to project the data into extremely low-D subspace in which JL lemma does not hold, but solving sub-problems on multiple times of such random projections can still recover the true solution w.h.p. In contrast, the JL Lemma based methods have to project the data into a single yet much higher dimensional subspace to gain high probability in recovering the original solution. The idea of divide-and-conquer randomization in DCA is more preferred in developing randomized algorithm, because 1) the complexity of solving a sub-problem is usually super-linear in data dimension; and 2) parallelizing the sub-problems in DCA gives further speedup."

This is because 1) Limited by the simplex constraint in NMF, the Bayes learning method decomposes the row-normalized X in (27), thus it needs to additionally compute p(w2 = j|w1 = i) and p(w1 = i) for normalization, and ∑ i p(z = et|x = ei)p(x = ei) after NMF; and 2)The greedy algorithm in [4] finds the anchors of convex hull is slower than DCA using parallel and randomized strategy.\nThe equivalence between [4] and our method can be established by the following theorem. In order to make the comparison clear, we map all the notations in our method to those used in [4] such that Q ← E(x1 ⊗ x2), V ← A, A ← OT , vt denotes the index of the anchor word for topic t, Āt,i ← At,i/At,vt , wi = j ⇔ xi = ej , zi = j ⇔ zi = ej . Then we use the notations in [4] throughout the theorem and its proof below. Theorem 4. Solving the conical hull problem Q = ĀTQV proposed in this paper for LDA equals to Bayes learning of p(z1 = t|w1 = i) by NMF proposed in [4], i.e.,\nQi,j = k∑ t=1 Āt,iQvt,j ⇔  p(w2 = j|w1 = i) = k∑ t=1 p(z1 = t|w1 = i) · p(w2 = j|z1 = t),\np(w1 = i|z1 = t) = p(z1=t|w1=i)p(w1=i)∑ i ′ p(z1=t|w1=i′ )p(w1=i′ ) .\n(40)\nProof. From the perspective of Bayes learning, the basic law of conditional probability gives us\np(w2 = j|w1 = i) = k∑ t=1 p(z1 = t|w1 = i)p(w2 = j|z1 = t). (41)\nSince At,i = p(z1 = t|w1 = i), given p(w2 = j|w1 = i) and p(w2 = j|z1 = t), solving the linear equations (41) over all {i, j} pairs gives the unique solution of A when k ≤ p. To relate this Bayes learning to our conical hull problem with form X = FXA, multiplying both sides of (41) by p(w1 = i) yields\np(w2 = j|w1 = i)p(w1 = i) = k∑ t=1 p(z1 = t|w1 = i)p(w1 = i) p(w1 = vt) · p(w2 = j|z1 = t)p(w1 = vt).\n(42) The definition of anchor word p(z1 = t|w1 = vt) = 1 leads to\np(w2 = j|w1 = vt) = p(w2 = j|z1 = t)p(z1 = t|w1 = vt) = p(w2 = j|z1 = t), (43)\nso the equation in (42) equals to\np(w1 = i, w2 = j) = k∑ t=1 p(z1=t|w1=i)p(w1=i) p(w1=vt) · p(w2 = j|w1 = vt)p(w1 = vt)\n= k∑ t=1 p(z1=t|w1=i)p(w1=i) p(z1=t) · p(z1=t)p(w1=vt) · p(w1 = vt, w2 = j)\n= k∑ t=1 p(w1=i|z1=t) p(w1=vt|z1=t) · p(w1 = vt, w2 = j).\n(44)\nThe last equality is due to Bayes’ rule and the definition of anchor word p(z1 = t|w1 = vt) = 1, i.e., p(z1=t|w1=i)p(w1=i)\np(z1=t) = p(w1 = i|z1 = t),\np(z1=t) p(w1=vt) = p(z1=t)p(z1=t|w1=vt)p(w1=vt) = 1 p(w1=vt|z1=t) . (45)\nSubstitute Qi,j = p(w1 = i, w2 = j) and Āt,i = At,i/At,vt = p(w1 = i|z1 = t)/p(w1 = vt|z1 = t) into the above equations (44), we achieve the model in the same form as conical hull problem\nQi,j = k∑ t=1 At,i At,vt ·Qvt,j . (46)\nSince A can be uniquely recovered as row-normalized Ā, and the above reasoning is reversible (due to all the equalities), the equivalence between conical hull problem and the Bayes learning [4] given in (40) holds."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a general scheme that can reduce the parameter learning for a broad class of models, e.g., matrix factorization and latent variable model, to a geometric problem that aims to find a limited number of extreme rays so called “anchors” of a conical hull from a finite set of real data points. Compared to EM and sampling, which are the dominating parameter learning methods nowadays, our approach avoids alternating updating between parameter and latent variables, does not require iterative procedures, and provide a global solution guarantee based on the identifiability of the anchor set. By generalizing the separability assumption X = FXA for unique NMF to a more adaptive case X = FYA, we propose a general minimum conical hull problem to formulate the reduced problem, and give rigorous theoretical analysis to the identifiability and uniqueness of its solution, as well as its interesting connections to other problems such as submodular set cover problem. As examples, we give the details of how to reduce learning NMF, subspace clustering, GMM, HMM, Kalman filter and LDA to the general minimum conical hull problem.\nWe further show that a novel idea of divide-and-conquer randomization leads to a significant efficient algorithm scheme for general minimum conical hull problem. In this “divide-and-conquer anchoring (DCA)” scheme, the original anchor finding task is distributed to multiple same-type sub-problems, each of which aims to find anchors (of the minimal conical hull) on a low-dimensional hyperplane, where the random projections of all data points lie in. Different from other randomized algorithms, each sub-problem in DCA only guarantees to recover a subset of anchors. This weaker requirement allows us to project the data points into extremely low-D hyperplane. But due to randomness, combining the anchors found in all sub-problems gives an accurate estimate of the true anchor set w.h.p.. Rigorous analysis shows that the number of sub-problem to achieve such probabilistic guarantee is merelyO(k log k), where k is the number of true anchors. Since we can apply any solver to the sub-problem, DCA provides a unified scheme solving general minimum conical hull problem. In addition, since most existing solvers have super-linear time complexity w.r.t. the data dimension, the algorithm generated by DCA invoking a solver is much faster than the solver itself. Furthermore, we show that DCA can be also used as a subroutine in other methods to provide an usually faster test checking if a point is covered by a conical hull or not.\nIn the special case when the hyperplane in each sub-problem is a 2D plane, we develop an ultrafast solver that precisely identifies the two 2D anchors by only computing an array of cosine values and finding the max/min values in a sub-array. Compared to the solvers relying on iterative optimization or sampling, our solver is simpler in implementation and faster in speed. Therefore, plugging it into DCA scheme produces a significantly effective DCA algorithm, which is later applied to all examples of learning algorithm design for specific models.\nComprehensive experiments on rich datasets and thorough comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms for different learning tasks promisingly justify the significant improvement in speed and robustness brought by our approach. In particular, DCA algorithms for different specific models usually show tens to thousands times acceleration, and better generalization performance on test sets. Moreover, the anchors selected from real data points often provide more interpretable models and convincing explanations, which are preferred in real applications."

      "text" : "Although we present both the general minimum conical hull problem formulation for general learning models, and the unified scheme of DCA for solving the problem with detailed examples on popular specific models, there are several interesting and important potential extended topics of our method.\n• In order to break the linearity assumption E(x|h) = hTOT and generalize distribution p(x|h) to even non-parametric forms, we can consider to embed the joint distribution of {xi}i∈[3] into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Hence we can instead assume E(x|h) = f(h), where function f(·) is an point in RKHS. Accordingly, the moments of finite feature vectors in (15) becomes moment operators of feature functions (or infinite feature vectors). By using the kernel trick introduced by reproducing property, the learning problem can be solved in n-D space in the same way as methods proposed in this paper. Note the same trick can be used to model and solve kernel matrix factorization in functional space too.\n• In higher order graphical models (e.g., n-gram models, higher order MRF and CRF) engaging more complicated structures, we usually parameterize the models with higher order (conditional) moments of p(x|h), rather than conditional mean. By using the trick replacing xi in (15) with vec(xi⊗n), the vectorization of the nth tensor power of xi, columns of O stores the conditional moments and can be recovered by using our approach in this paper.\n• In hierarchical graphical model (e.g., Bayesian networks) where x ∼ p(x|h1) and ht ∼ p(ht|ht−1), we can apply our method to each layer of the model in a bottom-up learning manner and learn the parameters for each layer sequentially by chain rule. A very related work [2] has shown this possibility for linear Bayesian networks. However, the estimation bias can be propagated throughout the learning process and leads to poor estimation of the parameters in higher layers. The general separability assumption in our method is capable to provide effective regularizations reducing the increasing bias.\n• The paper also provides an interesting potential solver to semi-definite programming (SDP) when the matrix variable X has a low-rank penalty/constraint, which is exactly the case for many popular machine learning models. The essential idea is to represent X by a weighted sum of k rank-one matrices [25], each of which is generated by a real data point. In optimization, we can either randomly select multiple rank-one matrices according to some probability, or select them in a greedy fashion according to certain score. In most situations, the probability or score is proportional to the probability of being anchors, and hence can be quickly obtained by solving a general minimum conical hull problem by DCA. This optimization approach is able to produce a more interpretable low-rank solution with faster speed.\nWe believe that inspired by the new insights of this paper in both problem formulation and algorithm design, the learning process of various machine learning models can be largely simplified and significantly accelerated. In addition, the learning results can become more convincing and explainable even for users outside machine learning community."

These k “anchors” lead to a global solution and a more interpretable model that can even outperform EM and sampling on generalization error. To find the k anchors, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer learning scheme “DCA” that distributes the problem to O(k log k) same-type sub-problems on different low-D random hyperplanes, each can be solved by any solver. For the 2D sub-problem, we present a non-iterative solver that only needs to compute an array of cosine values and its max/min entries. DCA also provides a faster subroutine for other methods to check whether a point is covered in a conical hull, which improves algorithm design in multiple dimensions and brings significant speedup to learning. We apply our method to GMM, HMM, LDA, NMF and subspace clustering, then show its competitive performance and scalability over other methods on rich datasets.",
