This paper introduces a dynamic type of normalization that forces the system to escape saddle points. Unlike other saddle point escaping algorithms, second order information is not utilized, and the system can be trained with an arbitrary gradient descent learner. The system drastically improves learning in a range of deep neural networks on various data-sets in comparison to non-CPN neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:43:21 GMT  (462kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09522v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 08:29:40 GMT  (462kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09522v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["armen aghajanyan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09522"}
