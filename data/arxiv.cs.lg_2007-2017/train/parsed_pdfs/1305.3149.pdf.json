      "text" : "Oil pureness is a very important aspect of the quality edible oil for special reasons of the sensory properties, perceived health values and the confidence of the health foods Lees (2003). Adulteration of oil products, involving the replacement of expensive ingredients with the cheaper substitutes, could potentially be very lucrative for a vendor or raw material supplier. Thus, continuous vigilance is required to control the adulteration of the edible oil products such as sesame oil in Asian food and to protect the interests of the consumers.\nIn order to evaluate the quality of the edible oil and detect its adulteration, a number of chromatographic Lorenzo et al. (2002); Mariani et al. (2006) and spectroscopic methods, including fluorescence Sikorska et al. (2005), near-infrared (NIR) Christy et al. (2004); Downey et al. (2002), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) Maggio et al. (2010); Oussama et al. (2012), FT-Raman Yang et al. (2005), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Vigli et al. (2003); Fragaki et al. (2005); Agiomyrgianakia et al. (2010), mass spectrometry (MR) Lorenzo et al. (2002); Lerma-Garćıa et al. (2008), mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) Gurdeniz & Ozen (2009); Rohmana & Man (2011), dielectric spectroscopy Lizhi et al. (2010) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) Dionisi et al. (1995); El-Hamd & El-Fizga (1995); Calvano et al. (2010); Brandao et al. (2012) are widely used to analyze the composition of the oil (e.g. olive oil or sun-flower oil) even the possible adulterants. In most applications found in the literature of oil-adulteration detection, the multivariate statistical analysis like linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Lorenzo et al. (2002); Rohmana & Man (2011), principal component analysis (PCA) Christy et al. (2004), partial least square regression (PLS) Cataldo et al. (2012); Downey et al. (2002); Gurdeniz & Ozen (2009); Rohmana & Man (2011) and artificial neural networks (ANN) Oliveros et al. (2002) are applied to further analyze the oil spectroscopy.\nHowever, these data analysis techniques heavily depend on the chromatographic and spectroscopic methods or the hand-crafting analysis methods. In the case of spectral data, not all contributes are unique or useful information although the elimination of predictors of limited or negligible utility can increase the efficiency of the models or make their interpretation simpler. Some attribute features only can be suitable for certain chromatographic or spectroscopic methods but not for others. Generally, the conventional analysis approaches depend on the visualization analysis of the special features\nand the special chemical treatment for certain oil samples. It is worthy to develop the powerful data analysis approaches under more precise measures for the authentication of the adulterant oil.\nIn this study, we focus on detecting the adulteration qualitatively and precisely with machine learning methods including classification method and multi-label learning. After extracting HPLC data based on the triglyceride of oil samples, we tried to solve the following three questions simultaneously: Is the oil sample adulterant? How does it constitute? What is the main ingredient of the adulteration oil? First, we used the classical adaptive boosting with multi-class Hamming loss (AdaBoost.MH) classification method to determine that the oil is adulterant or not in contrast with the support vector machine (SVM) that is widely applied in the oil authentication Caetano et al. (2007); Devos et al. (2009). AdaBoost.MH is the combination of multiple weak classifiers, where each weak classifier related to an optimal feature implements the feature selection in some sense. The experimental results show that AdaBoost.MH achieves the superior performance than SVM. Meanwhile, it is easy-to-use for the practical application with only one parameter T and T is set to 100 enough to work well unlike SVM that implements the model optimization in the grid of two parameters. In addition, we also explored the role of the principal component analysis (PCA) preprocessing in AdaBoost.MH classification method and the empirical results demonstrate that AdaBoost.MH performs better when using all features because PCA doesn’t consider the class information and can not guarantee the class separation. Second, we regarded the samples of the pure oil and the adulterant oil as ones with one label and multiple labels, respectively. Then we could apply multi-label learning to detect the ingredients of the adulterant oil. We further analyzed the relative ratio of the components in the adulterant oil with multilabel learning vector quantization (ML-LVQ) Jin et al. (2012) although the multi-label AdaBoost.MH can predict the labels of the oil samples Huo et al. (2012). Finally, The statistical analysis including the micro-F1, the macroF1, the average precision, the one-error, the accuracy and the detect rate measures gives the full comparisons between the multi-label AdaBoost.MH and the ML-LVQ approaches."

Finally, we use MLLVQ to analyze onward the relative ratio of the different component in the adulterant oil.\nAs a reference, we also give the analysis results on the state-of-art methods including SVM and PCA, where SVM Burges (1998) constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in the high dimensional space to maximize the margin.

We often use +1 and −1 to sign the oil sample as the adulterant oil and the pure oil, respectively. The following classification model is built by using a non-linear function from the input data to the real number. By the sign of f(x), we can predict the unknown sample x as the adulteration if f(x) > 0 otherwise as the pure oil.\nAdaBoost.MH 1 combines the final hypothesis by calling the weak learner repeatedly in a series of rounds in a varying data distribution. On each round, the weights of each incorrectly classified example are increased, and the weights of each correctly classified example are decreased, so next new classifier focuses on the examples which have so far eluded correct classification."

So the pure oil and the adulterant oil are attached with only one label and more than one label, respectively. The multi-label classification algorithm can not only recognize the components of the adulterant oil, but also detect the adulteration oil like the binary AdaBoost.MH in section 2.4.1 when predicting the unknown oil sample. We will introduce multi-label AdaBoost.MH algorithm Schapire & Singer (1999) in the following.\nLet us consider a labeled datasetD = {(xn, tn)} N n=1, where tn is the subset of L = {1, 2, · · · , L} instead of {+1,−1}. The successful multi-label learning will produce a ranking of the possible labels to rank the outputs in the label\n1Schapire Schapire & Singer (1999) proposed the discrete AdaBoost.MH and the real AdaBoost.MH in his work, but we really refer to the real AdaBoost.MH in the context.\nset t on the top of those not in t or make the difference between the predict label set and the true label set as small as possible.\nMulti-label AdaBoost.MH algorithm decomposes the problem into k binary classification problems. We can take the predicting target as L binary labels depending on whether a label l is or not included in tn. Then f(x, l) can be viewed as one of L binary predictions for the label l. On round t, the weak learner accepts a weighted dataset with a distribution and generates a weak classifier. We will assign the instance x with the label l only if f(x, l) > 0."

      "text" : "It is worthy to note that multi-label AdaBoost.MH can predict the constituents of the adulterant oil but it can not determine the relative ratio of the ingredient effectively in the adulterant oil. For instance, although we know that the adulterated oil is composed of the soybean oil and peanut oil, it is not clear that the soybean oil is adulterated in the peanut oil or the peanut oil is adulterated in the soybean oil. ML-LVQ Jin et al. (2012) considers the label ranking problem effectively when the example is assigned with multiple labels.\nML-LVQ extends LVQ to handle the multi-label problems, where the minimum classification error on the set of labels can approximate the rank loss. ML-LVQ minimizes the upper bound of ranking loss by the stochastic gradient descent. When the n-th training example is given in the t-th iteration, two prototypes from the positive class and the negative class are updated for each label from the set tn by computing the derivative of the loss.\nGiven a test example x, the algorithm will output the predict value for each label. The meta-labeler with the meta-model predicts the number of x’s labels as k(x). So the top k(x) highest scoring categories are chosen as the labels of x for prediction and then sorted to predict their relative ratio in the oil sample."

The detailed procedure was below:\n1. For each run, the dataset was randomly divided into five disjoint subsets of approximately same size by stratified sampling. We kept the same divisions for all learning algorithms.\n2. Each of five subsets was used as test set and the remaining data was used for training. The five subsets were used for testing rotationally for evaluating the performance of machine learning methods.\n3. During each training process, the training parameters were determined as follows: first, we held out 1/3 of the training data by stratified sampling for validation while the model parameters were estimated on the remaining 2/3 of data (the split of training data is the same for all learning algorithms). After selecting training parameters that gave the highest validation accuracy, all the training data was used to re-train the classifier for evaluation on test data."

The bipartitions measures compute the average difference between the actual and the predicted set of the labels including the macro-averaging and the microaveraging of F1 (mac-F1 and mic-F1). The ranking measures evaluate the average difference between the true ranking and the predicted ranking including the one-error and the average precision (avg-prec).\nWe also give the accuracy measure in order to contrast with previous binary classification problems. Finally, we provide the detect rate (detectrate) to evaluate the predicted label set is identical to the true label set or not."

      "text" : "SVM is a classic classification approaches applied in chemometrics Cogdill & Dardenne (2004) and diagnosis Çomaka et al. (2007). In our work, we give the comparisons on SVM and AdaBoost.MH. Specially, we run AdaBoost.MH with and without PCA preprocessing to analyze the effects of PCA.\nThe optimal model parameters were found with the strategy described in the beginning of this section. We chosen T from {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}\nfor AdaBoost.MH, where T is the number of stumps. The SVM classifier with RBF kernel was implemented by the bioinformatics toolbox in Matlab. We only considered the tradeoff parameter C and the kernel width γ, where both of log2C and log2 γ were selected from {−5,−3,−1, 1, 3, 5}. The best average accuracy with AdaBoost.MH and SVM on ten run of 5-cross fold are 96.46% and 94.92%, respectively. We can see that AdaBoost.MH achieves better performance than SVM with the RBF kernel. The optimal model parameters from one of ten runs are listed in Tab. 2. In Fig. 2, we can find that fact that the accuracy is a non-linear function of the parameters (log2C and log2 γ) makes the determination of the model parameters difficult. But for AdaBoost.MH (see Fig. 3), the accuracy will generally increase with the growing parameter T until convergence. The ideal model parameter is easily determined when considering the tradeoff between the running time and the accuracy. Tab. 2 shows that AdaBoost.MH algorithm converges early before T reaches its maximum.\nFinally, we also explored how PCA influences the classifier (see AdaBoost.MH in Tab. 3). We can achieve the high accuracy (90.05%) with 35 dimensions of features, but it is far inferior to the performance using all features due to the facts that PCA can not guarantee the class separation on the features whiling preserving most of the data information. In reality, AdaBoost.MH implements the feature selection in some sense."

      "text" : "We compared the performance of multi-label AdaBoost.MH and ML-LVQ algorithm on both of the detection of the ingredient and the relative ratio of the adulterant oil in Tab. 4. We used the macro-F1, the micro-F1, the one-error, the avg-prec, the accuracy and the detect-rate for the performance\nevaluation. In the validation of the model parameters, we observed that it is no obvious difference when using other measures instead of mic-F1 for the validation.\nIn the implementation of ML-LVQ, the prototypes were initialized by K-means clustering of class-wise data. Each attribute of the examples was scaled to [−1,+1]. We only optimized the number of the prototypes (S) for ML-LVQ and the number of the stumps (T) for multi-label AdaBoost.MH, where S was set to {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and T to {20, 40, 60, 80, 100}. The initial learning rate η(0) in the stochastic gradient descent was assigned to 0.1*cov, where cov is the average distance of all training examples to the nearest cluster center. By default, M = 40 and α = 0 is enough to work well. MLLVQ used AdaBoost.MH classifier with 100 decision stumps as the metalabeler.\nIn Tab. 4, we observe that ML-LVQ (accuracy = 95.32%) obtains higher accuracy than multi-label AdaBoost.MH (accuracy = 88.08%) and it is slightly inferior to AdaBoost.MH classification method (with 96.46%). Further, MLLVQ shows the superior performance in predicting the ingredient components and the relative ratio of components in contrast with multi-label AdaBoost.MH especially on the mac-F1 measure. It is surprising that the predicting ability of ML-LVQ can also reach to 92.59% (refer to the detect-rate) when the algorithm predicts the entire set of the ingredients. Finally, Tab. 5 gives the model parameters found by multi-label AdaBoost.MH and MLLVQ in one run, where ML-LVQ always sets S = 1 as the optimal parameter. We need few prototypes enough to represent a kinds of examples since most kinds of oil examples contains few examples such that nine cotton oil samples only appear in the mixture of the sesame oil and the cotton oil.\nLet us take a close look at 25 incorrectly predicted examples by ML-LVQ\nfrom 370 examples. Fig. 4 gives the detect rates when adulterating the oil with the ratio of both ingredients in the range [0%, 99%]. It is clear to see that the detect rates will decrease when increasing the relative ratio of both ingredients. Then the multi-label algorithm can predict more precisely for nearly 50% than nearly 0% or 100% (the point 0% corresponds to the case of the pure oil). In fact, our multi-label algorithm achieves about 98% in the detect-rate measure for 246 pure oil samples in Fig. 4. There appears the vibration in the point 95% (the square point in Fig. 4) since there are 3 examples for 95% adulteration rate without demonstrating the statistical meanings. Fig. 4 shows the phenomenon that is consistent with our intuition.\nFinally, we compare the true labels and the predict labels of 25 misclassified examples to discover that the ML-LVQ can predict the main ingredient for all of them. For instance, the algorithm predicts the certain sample\nincorrectly as the palm oil adulterated with the sesame one but the sample is really composes of the palm oil adulterated with 20% soybean one."

      "text" : "HPLC data of the edible oil with their mixture was investigated to answer the following questions: Is the oil sample adulterant? How does it constitute? What is the main ingredient of the adulteration oil? In our study, we applied the handy AdaBoost.MH to detect the oil sample is adulterant or not to achieve a higher accuracy than the state of art SVM. In addition, AdaBoost.MH with PCA does not show the better performance than one without any preprocessing since PCA can not guarantee the class separation on the features. Finally, we used multi-label AdaBoost.MH and ML-LVQ to recognize the ingredient and their relative ratio when taking the adulterant oil and the pure oil as the examples with multiple labels and one labels, respectively. The comparisons between multi-label AdaBoost.MH and MLLVQ on multiple measures show that ML-LVQ is more promising than AdaBoost.MH in solving above three questions. We also note that our method can only detect the oil adulteration qualitatively unlike the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) Wu et al. (2008) which can measure the ingredients quantitatively. Finally, these data analysis approaches are also suitable for following other chromatographic and spectroscopic methods such as NIR or MR instead of HPLC."

After extracting the highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data on triglyceride from 370 oil samples, we applied the adaptive boosting with multi-class Hamming loss (AdaBoost.MH) to distinguish the oil adulteration in contrast with the support vector machine (SVM). Further, we regarded the adulterant oil and the pure oil samples as ones with multiple labels and with only one label, respectively. Then multi-label AdaBoost.MH and multi-label learning vector quantization (ML-LVQ) model were built to determine the ingredients and their relative ratio in the adulteration oil. The experimental results on six measures show that ML-LVQ achieves better performance than multi-label AdaBoost.MH.",
