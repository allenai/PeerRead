{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Finding a Jack-of-All-Trades: An Examination of Semi-supervised Learning in Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "Deep learning has proven useful on many NLP tasks including reading comprehension. However it requires a lot of training data which are not available in some domains of application. Hence we examine the possibility of using data-rich domains to pre-train models and then apply them in domains where training data are harder to get. Specifically, we train a neural-network-based model on two context-question-answer datasets, the BookTest and CNN/Daily Mail, and we monitor transfer to subsets of bAbI, a set of artificial tasks designed to test specific reasoning abilities, and of SQuAD, a question-answering dataset which is much closer to real-world applications. Our experiments show very limited transfer if the model isn\u2019t shown any training examples from the target domain however the results are promising if the model is shown at least a few target-domain examples. Furthermore we show that the effect of pre-training is not limited to word embeddings.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This work investigates the performance of transfer learning from resource-rich setup (BookTest, CNN/Daily Mail corpora) to low-resource (bAbI, SQuAD benchmarks) settings.

The model is trained on the big artificial dataset and tested on the small target datasets (section 4.1)\n2. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before, then fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. Several such models are trained using different sub-sets of fine-tuning examples. The results are tested against the performance of randomly intialized then fine-tuned models (section 4.2).\n3. The model is pre-trained on the big artificial dataset like before. The model is made of an embedding component and an encoder  component. Alternatively, each component is reset to a random initialization, to test the importance of the pre-training in each component. Then the model is fine-tuned on a few examples from the target dataset and tested on the remaining target examples. (section 4.3)\n\nI think what makes things difficult to follow is the fact that the test set is composed by several sub tasks, and sometimes what is reported is the mean performance across the tasks, sometimes the performance on a few tasks. Sometimes what we see is the mean performance of several models? You should report standard deviations also. Could you better explain what you mean by best validation ?\n\nInteresting and unpretentious work. The clarity of the presentation could be improved maybe by simplifying the experimental setup? The interesting conclusion I think is reported at the end of the section 4.1, when the nuanced difference between the datasets are exposed.\n\nMinor: unexplained acronyms: GRU, BT, CBT.\nbenfits p. 2\nsubsubset p. 6", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "27 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a study of transfer learning in the context of QA from stories. A system is presented with a a short story and has to answer a question about it. This paper studies how a system trained to answer questions on a dataset can eventually be used to answer questions from another dataset. The results are mostly negative: transfer seems almost non-existant.\n\nThis paper is centered around presenting negative results. Indeed the main hypothesis of transferring between QA datasets with the attention sum reader turns out impossible and one needs a small portion of labeled data from the target dataset to get meaningful performance.\n\nHaving only negative results could be fine if the paper was bringing some value with a sharp analysis of the failure modes and of the reasons behind it. Because this might indicate some research directions to follow. However, there is not much of that. \n\nThe answers to the pre-review questions actually start to give some insights: typing seems to be transferred for instance. How about the impact of syntax (very different between bAbI, Gutenberg books, and CNN news articles)? And the word/entity/ngrams distributions overlap between the 3 datasets?\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much to take-away from this paper.\n ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "needs more thorough analysis", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This work investigates the performance of transfer learning from resource-rich setup (BookTest, CNN/Daily Mail corpora) to low-resource (bAbI, SQuAD benchmarks) settings.
