Such reasoning patterns, and therefore non-monotonicity, acquires a special significance in the context of spatio-temporal dynamics, or computational commonsense reasoning about space, actions, and change as applicable within areas as disparate as geospatial dynamics, computer-aided design, cognitive vision, and commonsense cognitive robotics (Bhatt 2012). Dynamic spatial systems are characterised by scenarios where spatial configurations of objects undergo a change as the result of interactions within a physical environment (Bhatt and Loke 2008); this requires explicitly identifying and formalising relevant actions and events at both an ontological and (qualitative and geometric) spatial level; for instance:\n• within the context of geographical information systems, formalising high-level processes such as desertification and population displacement based on spatial theories about appearance, disappearance, splitting, motion, and growth of regions (Bhatt and Wallgrün 2014); • within a domain such as (commonsense) cognitive vision from visual imagery (e.g., video, point-clouds etc), the ability to perform spatio-linguistically grounded semantic question-answering about perceived and hypothesised events based on a commonsense qualitative model of space and motion (Suchan and Bhatt 2016a).\nRequirements such as in the aforementioned domains call for a deep integration of spatial reasoning within KR-based non-monotonic reasoning frameworks (Bhatt 2012; Bhatt et al. 2011).\nIn this paper, we select aspects of a theory of dynamic spatial systems —pertaining to spatial inertia, ramifications, and causal explanation— that are inherent to a broad category of dynamic spatio-temporal phenomena, and require non-monotonic reasoning (Bhatt and Loke 2008; Bhatt 2008; Bhatt 2010). For these aspects, we provide an operational semantics and a computational framework for realising fundamental non-monotonic spatial reasoning capabilities based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (Bartholomew and Lee 2013); ASPMT is extended to the qualitative spatial (QS) domain resulting in the non-monotonic spatial reasoning system ASPMT(QS). Spatial reasoning is performed in an analytic manner (e.g., as with reasoners such as CLP(QS) (Bhatt et al. 2011)), where spatial relations are encoded as systems of polynomial constraints; the task of determining whether a set of qualitative spatial constraints are consistent is now equivalent to determining whether the system of polynomial constraints is satisfiable, i.e., Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) with real nonlinear arithmetic, and can be accomplished in a sound and complete manner. Thus, ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into SMT instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers.\nIn the following sections we present the relevant foundations of stable model semantics and ASPMT, and then extend this to ASPMT(QS) by defining a relational,\nqualitative spatial representation module QS, and formalising default spatial reasoning and spatial frame and ramification axioms using choice formulas. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other existing spatial reasoning systems. In the backdrop of our results, and a discussion of related work, we conclude that ASPMT(QS) is the only system, to the best of our knowledge, that operationalises dynamic spatial reasoning – together with a systematic treatment of non-monotonic aspects emanating therefrom, within a KR-based framework."

      "text" : "Knowledge representation and reasoning about space may be formally interpreted within diverse frameworks such as: (a) geometric reasoning and constructive (solid) geometry (Kapur and Mundy 1988); (b) relational algebraic semantics of ‘qualitative spatial calculi’ (Ligozat 2011); and (c) by axiomatically constructed formal systems of mereotopology and mereogeometry (Aiello et al. 2007). Independent of formal semantics, commonsense spatio-linguistic abstractions offer a human-centred and cognitively adequate mechanism for logic-based automated reasoning about spatio-temporal information (Bhatt et al. 2013).\nResearch in qualitative spatial representation and reasoning has primarily been driven by the use of relational-algebraic semantics, and development of constraintbased reasoning algorithms to solve consistency problems in the context of qualitative spatial calculi (Ligozat 2011). The key idea has been to partition an infinite quantity space into finite disjoint categories, and utilize the special relational algebraic properties of such a partitioned space for reasoning purposes. Logic-based axiomatisations of topological and mereotopological space, a study of their general computational characteristics from a reasoning viewpoint, and the development of KR-based general reasoning systems have also been thoroughly investigated (Aiello et al. 2007; Bhatt et al. 2011).\nDifferent in its foundational method involving the use of constraint logic programming (CLP) is the declarative spatial reasoning system CLP(QS) (Bhatt et al. 2011; Schultz and Bhatt 2012; Schultz and Bhatt 2014). CLP(QS) marks a clear departure from other relational algebraically founded methods and reasoning tools by its use of the constraint logic programming framework for formalising the semantics of qualitative spatio-temporal relations and formal spatial calculi. CLP(QS) has demonstrated applications in a range of domains including: architectural design cognition (Bhatt et al. 2014), cognitive vision (Bhatt et al. 2013; Suchan et al. 2014; Suchan and Bhatt 2016a; Suchan and Bhatt 2016b), geospatial dynamics (Bhatt and Wallgrün 2014), and cognitive robotics (Eppe and Bhatt 2013; Spranger et al. 2014; Spranger et al. 2016)."

In what follows, we present a definition of stable models based on syntactic transformations (Bartholomew and Lee 2012) which is a generalization of previous definitions from (Ferraris et al. 2011), (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988), and (Ferraris 2005).

Then, the SMT problem is to check if a given SMT instance has a model that expands the background theory. ASPMT is an generalization of ASP analogous to a generalization of SAT obtained with SMT (the syntax of ASPMT is the same as the syntax of SMT).\nIt is shown in (Bartholomew and Lee 2013) that a tight part of ASPMT instances can be turned into SMT instances and, as a result, off-the-shelf SMT solvers (e.g., Z3 (De Moura and Bjørner 2008) for arithmetic over reals) may be used to compute stable models of ASP.

With topological calculi such as the Region Connection Calculus (RCC) (Randell et al. 1992), the primitive entities are spatially extended regions of space, and could possibly even be 4D spatio-temporal histories, e.g., for motionpattern analyses. Alternatively, within a dynamic domain involving translational motion, point-based abstractions with orientation calculi could suffice (e.g., using the Oriented-Point Relation Algebra (OPRAm) (Moratz 2006)). The qualitative spatial domain (QS) that we consider in the formal framework of this paper encompasses the following ontology.\nQS1. Domain Entities in QS Domain entities in QS include circles, triangles, points, segments, convex polygons, and egg-yolk regions. While our method is applicable to a wide range of 2D and 3D spatial objects and qualitative relations for example, as defined in (Pesant and Boyer 1994; Bouhineau 1996; Pesant and Boyer 1999; Bouhineau et al. 1999; Bhatt et al. 2011; Schultz and Bhatt 2012; Schultz and Bhatt 2014), for brevity and clarity we primarily focus on a 2D spatial domain:\n• a point is a pair of reals x , y , • a line segment is a pair of end points p1, p2 (p1 6= p2), • a circle is a centre point p and a real radius r (0 < r), • a triangle is a triple of vertices (points) p1, p2, p3 such that p3 is placed to the\nleft of the directed segment p1, p2, i.e. left with respect to the direction of the segment from p1 to p2, • a convex polygon is defined by a list of n vertices (points) p1, . . . , pn (spatially ordered counter-clockwise) such that pk is left of the directed segment pi , pj for all 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n,\n• an egg yolk region1 is defined by a circular upper and lower approximation c+, c− such that c− is a proper part of c+.\nQS2. Spatial Relations in QS We define a range of spatial relations with the corresponding polynomial encodings. Examples of spatial relations in QS include: Relative Orientation. Left, right, collinear orientation relations between points and segments, and parallel, perpendicular relations between segments (Lee 2014).\nMereotopology.

Then, circle c ∈ Cirlces may be described by means of parametric functions as follows:\nx (c) = 1.23 ∧ y(c) = −0.13 ∧ r(c) = 2.\nDefinition 8 (Qualitative spatial relation)\nA qualitative spatial relation is an n-ary predicate\nQn ⊆ D1 ×D2 × . . .×Dn ,\n1 The egg-yolk method of modelling regions with indeterminante boundaries (Cohn and Gotts 1996) can be employed to characterise a class of regions (including polygons) that satisfies topological and relative orientation relations (Schultz and Bhatt 2015a). Each egg-yolk region is an equivalence class for all regions that are contained within the upper approximation (the egg white), and completely contain the lower approximation (the egg yolk).\nsuch that for any i ∈ {1 . . .n}, Di is a type of spatial object.

The corresponding formula of the relation states that two circles are in the EC relation whenever the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii and is as follows:\n∀c1, c2 ∈ Circles ( ((x (c1)−x (c2))2+(y(c1)−y(c2))2 = (r(c1)+r(c2))2 → EC (c1, c2) ) ,\nProposition 1 Each qualitative spatial relation according to Definition 8 may be represented as a tight formula in Clark normal form.\nProof Follows directly from Definitions 3 and 8.\nThus, qualitative spatial relations belong to a part of ASPMT that may be turned into SMT instances by transforming the implications in the corresponding formulas into equivalences (Clark completion). The obtained equivalence between polynomial expressions and predicates enables us to compute relations whenever parametric information is given, and vice versa, i.e., computing possible parametric values when only the qualitative spatial relations are known.\nMany relations from existing qualitative calculi may be represented in ASPMT(QS) according to Definition 8; our system can express the polynomial encodings presented in, e.g., (Pesant and Boyer 1994; Bouhineau 1996; Pesant and Boyer 1999; Bouhineau et al. 1999; Bhatt et al. 2011). In what follows we give some illustrative results (see Appendix B for proofs).\nProposition 2 Each relation of Interval Algebra (IA) (Allen 1983) and Rectangle Algebra (RA) (Guesgen 1989) may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\nProposition 3 Each relation of the Left-Right Algebra (LR) (Scivos and Nebel 2004) may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\nProposition 4 Each relation of RCC–5 (Randell et al. 1992) in the domain of convex polygons with a finite number of vertices may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\nProposition 5\nEach relation of Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) (Frank 1991) may be defined in ASPMT(QS).\n4.3 POLYNOMIAL SEMANTICS FOR QS\npapb\npc\npapb\npc\nAnalytic geometry gives us a general, sound, and complete way of working with spatial relations.2 Analytic geometry can be applied to encode the semantics of high-level qualitative spatial relations using systems of real polynomial constraints; determining spatial consistency is then equivalent to determining satisfiability of these polynomial constraints. Given polynomial constraints over a set of real variables X,\nthe constraints are satisfiable if there exists some real value for each variable in X such that all the polynomial constraints are simultaneously satisfied. As an example, consider the definition of a relative qualitative distance relation such as nearer than: point a is nearer than b with respect to a reference point c if the distance between a, c is less than the distance between b, c, denoted nearer_than(a, b, c) (Figure 1):\n(ax − cx )2 + (ay − cy)2 < (bx − cx )2 + (by − cy)2·\nSimilarly, the relation of point p3 being left of segment sp1p2 is encoded as the following polynomial constraint (Bhatt et al. 2011):\np3 left of sp1p2 ≡def (x2 − x1)(y3 − y1) > (y2 − y1)(x3 − x1)\nIf there exists an assignment of real values to the variables (e.g., ax = 3, cx = 10 · 5 in the nearness relation) that satisfies the polynomial equations and inequalities, then the qualitative spatial relations are consistent. Continuing with the example of relative nearness relations, consider a qualitative spatial description with the relations: nearer_than(a, b, c), nearer_than(b, a, c). This is encoded in the following polynomial constraints:\n(ax − cx )2 + (ay − cy)2 < (bx − cx )2 + (by − cy)2,\n(ax − cx )2 + (ay − cy)2 > (bx − cx )2 + (by − cy)2,\n2 Tarski famously proved that the theory of real-closed fields is decidable via quantifier elimination (see (Collins 1975; Arnon et al. 1984; Collins and Hong 1991) for an overview and algorithms); i.e., in a finite amount of time we can determine the consistency (or inconsistency) of any formula consisting of quantifiers (∀, ∃) over the reals, and polynomial equations and inequalities combined using logical connectors (∧, ∨, ¬). Thus, by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints (i.e., analytic geometry) we can employ polynomial constraint solving methods that are guaranteed to determine (in)consistency, giving us sound and complete spatial reasoning.\nwhich can be reformulated as\ndac < dbc , dac > dbc .\nAs the real value dac cannot be both greater and smaller than dbc , this system of polynomial constraints is inconsistent, and no configuration of points (within a Euclidean space) exists that can satisfy this set of qualitative spatial constraints.\nA range of qualitative spatial relations can be similarly encoded in the form of polynomial constraints, e.g., see Table 1 and Figure 2 for encondings for RCC relations3 with corresponding ASPMT encodings in Appendix C.\nExamples of specific polynomial encodings for topological and orientation relations can be found in (Pesant and Boyer 1994; Bouhineau 1996; Pesant and Boyer 1999; Bhatt et al. 2011; Schultz and Bhatt 2014; Schultz and Bhatt 2015b) (also, Appendix H presents optimisations for encodings). Since ASPMT(QS) enables the use of poly-\nnomial equations and inequalities, a number of spatial relations known from qualitative calculi may be expressed (Propositions 2-5, and Appendix B)."

Consider the initial situation S0 presented in Figure 4, consisting of three cells: a, b, c, such that a is a non-tangential proper part of b: rccNTPP(a, b, 0), and b is externally connected to c: rccEC(b, c, 0).\n4 The fundam ntal disti ction between CLP(QS) and ASPMT(QS) is the declarativ fr mework that has been extended, in particular, Constraint Logic Programming does not facilitate nonmonotonic reasoning and thus cannot be used to formalise default rules, spatial inertia, etc.\n. Growth. Let a grow in step S0; the event growth(a, 0) occurs and leads to a successor situation S1. The direct effect of growth(a, 0) is a change of a relation between a and b from rccNTPP(a, b, 0) to rccEQ(a, b, 1) (i.e., a is equal to b). No change of the relation between a and c is directly stated, and thus we must derive the relation rccEC(a, c, 1) as an indirect effect.\n. Motion. Let a move in step S0; the event motion(a, 0) leads to a successor situation S1. The direct effect is a change of the relation rccNTPP(a, b, 0) to rccTPP(a, b, 1) (a is a tangential proper part of b). In the successor situation S1 we must determine that the relation between a and c can only be either rccDC(a, c, 1) or rccEC(a, c, 1).\nGQR provides no support for domain-specific reasoning, and thus we encoded the problem as two distinct qualitative constraint networks (one for each simulation step) and solved them independently, i.e., with no definition of growth and motion. Thus, GQR is not able to produce any additional information about indirect effects. As Clingo lacks any mechanism for analytic geometry, we implemented the RCC8 composition table and thus it inherits the incompleteness of relation algebraic reasoning. While CLP(QS) facilitates the modelling of domain rules such as growth, there is no native support for default reasoning and thus we forced b and c to remain unchanged between simulation steps, otherwise all combinations of spatially consistent actions on b and c are produced without any preference (i.e., leading to the frame problem).\nIn contrast, ASPMT(QS) can express spatial inertia, and derives indirect effects\ndirectly from spatial reasoning: in the Growth problem we can use ASPMT(QS) to abduce that a has to be concentric with b in S0 (otherwise a move event would also need to occur).5 Checking global consistency of scenarios that contain interdependent spatial relations is a crucial feature that is enabled by the method of polynomial encodings and is provided only by CLP(QS) and ASPMT(QS)."

      "text" : "In problems Attachment I and Attachment II the initial situation S0 consists of three objects (circles), namely car, trailer and garage as presented in Figure 5. Initially, the trailer is attached to the car: rccEC(car, trailer, 0), attached(car, trailer, 0). The successor situation S1 is described by rccTPP(car, garage, 1). The task is to infer the possible relations between the trailer and the garage, and the necessary actions that would need to occur in each scenario.\nThere are two domain-specific actions: the car can move, move(car,X ), and the trailer can be detached, detach(car, trailer,X ) in simulation step X . Whenever the trailer is attached to the car, they remain rccEC. The car and the trailer may be either completely outside or completely inside the garage.\n. Attachment I. Given the available topological information, we must infer that there are two possible solutions (Figure. 5); (a) the car was detached from the trailer\n5 That is, we can define a binary predicate concentric between two circles that is true when the centre points of the circles are equal, and false when they are not equal. ASPMT(QS) abduces that not concentric is unsatisfiable, i.e. that the circles are necessarily concentric.\nand then moved into the garage: (b) the car, together with the trailer attached to it, moved into the garage:\n. Attachment II. We are given additional geometric information about the objects’ size: r(car) = 2, r(trailer) = 2 and r(garage) = 3. Case (b) is now inconsistent, and we must determine that the only possible solution is (a).\nThese domain-specific rules require default reasoning: “typically the trailer remains in the same position” and “typically the trailer remains attached to the car”. The later default rule is formalised in ASPMT(QS) by means of the spatial default. The formalisation of such rules addresses the frame problem. GQR is not capable of expressing the domain-specific rules for detachment and attachment in Attachment I and Attachment II. Neither GQR nor Clingo is capable of reasoning with a combination of topological and numerical information, as required in Attachment II. As CLP(QS) cannot express default rules, we can not capture the notion that, for example, the trailer should typically remain in the same position unless we have some explicit reason for determining that it moved; once again this leads to an exhaustive enumeration of all possible scenarios without being able to specify preferences, i.e. the frame problem, and thus CLP(QS) will not scale in larger scenarios.\nThe results of the empirical evaluation show that ASPMT(QS) is the only system that is capable of (a) non-monotonic spatial reasoning, (b) expressing domainspecific rules that also have spatial aspects, and (c) integrating both qualitative and numerical information. Regarding the greater execution times in comparison to CLP(QS), we have not yet fully integrated available optimisations (e.g., based on spatial symmetry-driven pruning strategies (Schultz and Bhatt 2015b)) with respect to spatial reasoning; this is one of the directions of future work as the known performance gains are truly significant (Schultz and Bhatt 2015b)."

Furthermore, specialized relation-algebraically founded methods and prototypical spatial reasoning tools – working as black-box systems outside of any systematic KR method – have been a niche too. What is still missing in the field of spatial representation and reasoning is a modular, unifying KR framework of space, action, and change (Bhatt 2012) that would seamlessly integrate with or be accessible via general KR languages and frameworks in AI, and be applicable in a wide-range of application domains. Primarily, our research is motivated by addressing this gap.\nKR based methods and tools addressing spatio-temporal dynamics With a focus on commonsense reasoning about space, action, and change, the principal focus and long-term agenda of our research is to develop methods and generally usable tools for visuo-spatial problem solving with spatio-temporal configurations and dynamic phenomena at the scale of everyday human perception, abstraction, interpretation, and interaction. This agenda is being driven by the application domains that are being pursued independently in the areas of spatio-temporal narrative interpretation and synthesis, spatial computing for architecture design, cognitive vision and robotics, and geospatial dynamics (Bhatt et al. 2013). This level of generality, and our emphasis on mixed qualitative-quantitative spatial reasoning in the context of state of the art KR methods, namely constraint logic and answer set programming paradigms, will inherently offer a robust and scalable representational and computational foundation for the class of application areas that inspire and guide the basic research questions reported in this paper.\nRelated work on space and motion (Shanahan 1995) describes a default reasoning problem, analogous to the classic frame problem, which arises when an attempt is made to construct a logic-based calculus for reasoning about the movement of objects in a real-valued co-ordinate system. (Shanahan 1995)’s all-encompassing theory alludes to a unification of spatial, temporal and causal aspects at representational and computational levels. The use of commonsense reasoning about the physical properties of objects within a first-order logical framework has been investigated by (Davis 2008; Davis 2011). The aim here is to combine commonsense qualitative reasoning about “continuous time, Euclidean space, commonsense dynamics of solid objects, and semantics of partially specified plans” (Davis 2011). (Cabalar and Santos 2010) investigate the formalization of the commonsense representation that is necessary to solve spatial puzzles involving non-trivial objects such as holes and strings. (Bhatt and Loke 2008) explicitly formalize a dynamic spatial systems approach for the modelling of changing spatial domains using the Situation Calculus (McCarthy and Hayes 1969). A dynamic spatial system here is regarded as a specialization of the generic dynamic systems approach (Sandewall 1994; Reiter 2001) for the case where sets of qualitative spatial relationships (grounded in formal spatial calculi) undergo change as a result of actions and events in the system."

      "text" : "We have presented ASPMT(QS), a novel approach for reasoning about space and spatial change within a KR paradigm. By integrating dynamic spatial reasoning within a KR framework, namely answer set programming (modulo theories), our system can be used to model behaviour patterns that characterise high-level processes, events, and activities as identifiable with respect to a general characterisation of commonsense reasoning about space, actions, and change (Bhatt 2012; Bhatt and Loke 2008).\nASPMT(QS) is capable of sound and complete spatial reasoning, and combining qualitative and quantitative spatial information when reasoning non-monotonically;\nthis is due to the approach of encoding spatial relations as polynomial constraints, and solving using SMT solvers with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We have demonstrated that no other existing spatial reasoning system is capable of supporting the non-monotonic spatial reasoning features (e.g., spatial inertia, ramification, causal explanation) in the context of any systematic knowledge representation and reasoning method, be it a mainstream method such as answer set programming, or otherwise.\nThis work opens up several opportunities: the spatio-temporal ontology can be extended in many interesting ways with support for richer spatial relational as well as object domains. The polynomial encodings may be further optimised, and this is a topic that we have ourselves devoted considerable attention to (Schultz and Bhatt 2015b) (Appendix H). Most interestingly, there exist many possibilities to build additional modules directly on top of ASPMT(QS) concerning aspects such as visibility, spatio-temporal motion patterns (based on space-time histories) etc from the viewpoint of applications in cognitive vision, cognitive robotics, eyetracking or visual perception (Suchan et al. 2014; Suchan and Bhatt 2016a; Suchan and Bhatt 2016b), and to provide support for specialized, domain-specific spatiolinguistic characterisations identifiable in a range of spatial assistance systems and assistive technologies encompassing (spatial) logic, (spatial) language, and (spatial) cognition (Bhatt et al. 2013).\nAcknowledgments.\nWe acknowledge the support provided by the Polish National Science Centre grant 2011/02/A/HS1/0039, and the DesignSpace Group (www.designspace.org)."

We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning —a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems— based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT). ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other contemporary spatial reasoning systems both within and outside the context of logic programming. ASPMT(QS) is currently the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e., addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.",
