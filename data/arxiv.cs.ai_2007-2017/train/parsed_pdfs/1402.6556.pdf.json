      "text" : "The problem of debt clearing (DC problem) is one, that arises in real life situations as well. In a group of persons that know each other it is not uncommon to borrow some amount of money to an acquaintance for a period of time. This process is also happening among different banks, or even countries. As money transactions are time and money sensitive operations, it is desirable to clear the debts in a minimal number of money transaction operations.\nThe problem of settling debts was discussed by Verhoeff in 2004 ([9]). Pătcaş [6] later re-discovered the problem and proposed it in 2008 at the qualification contest of the Romanian national team of informatics. The solution was described in [6] and the problem conjectured to be intractable, which was earlier proved in [9]. In [7] the problem in a dynamic setting is discussed and a new algorithm given, having superior speed on some cases compared to the one described in [6]."

      "text" : "The problem statement is the following: Let us consider a number of n entities (persons, companies etc.), and a list of m borrowings among these entities. A borrowing can be described by three parameters: the index of the borrower entity, the index of the lender entity and the amount of money that was lent. The task is to find a minimal list of money\ntransactions that clears the debts formed among these n entities as a result of the m borrowings made.\nIt is natural to model this problem using graph theory. Consider the following definitions.\nDefinition 1 ([6]). Let G(V,A,W ) be a directed, weighted multigraph without loops, |V | = n, |A| = m, W : A → Z, where V is the set of vertices, A is the set of arcs and W is the weight function. G represents the borrowings made, so we will call it the borrowing graph.\nThe borrowing graph corresponding to the example in Figure 1 is depicted in Figure 2.\nDefinition 2 ([6]). Let us define for each vertex v ∈ V the absolute amount of debt over the graph G: DG(v) = ∑\nv′ ∈ V\n(v, v′) ∈ A\nW (v, v′)− ∑\nv′′ ∈ V\n(v′′, v) ∈ A\nW (v′′, v)\nSometimes for simplicity we will refer to the absolute amount of debt of a node as D value.\nTheD values corresponding to the example from Figure 1 are listed in Figure 3.\nDefinition 3 ([6]). Let G′(V,A′,W ′) be a directed, weighted multigraph without loops, with each arc (i, j) representing a transaction of W ′(i, j) amount of money from entity i to entity j. We call this graph a transaction graph. These transactions clear the debts formed by the borrowings modeled by graph G(V,A,W ) if and only if:\nDG(vi) = DG′(vi), ∀i = 1, n, where V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} We will note this by: G ∼ G′.\nSee Figure 4 for a transaction graph with minimal number of arcs corresponding to the example from Figure 1.\nWe are now ready to reformulate the problem mathematically: Given a borrowing graph G(V,A,W ) we are looking for a minimal transaction graph Gmin(V,Amin,Wmin), so that G ∼ Gmin and ∀G′(V,A′,W ′) : G ∼ G′, |Amin| ≤ |A′| holds."

      "text" : "The following observation is crucial in all of the solutions known so far.\nTheorem 4. Any instance of the DC problem can be solved trivially by at most n− 1 transactions.\nProof. We give an algorithmic proof.\n1. Let us choose two nodes i and j, such that D(i) > 0 and D(j) < 0.\n2. Add arc (i, j) to the transaction graph having weight min(D(i),−D(j)).\n3. Update the D values of i and j to reflect the addition of the arc (by decreasing D(i) and increasing D(j)).\n4. Repeat steps (1) - (3) as long as possible.\nIt is clear that at least one D value becomes zero as a result of executing steps (1) - (3). Also, because we have the invariant that the sum of all D values is always zero, at the last iteration we always have D(i) = −D(j). Thus two D values become zero at the last iteration, which yields to the needed upper bound.\nWe observe, that finding a minimal transaction graph is equivalent to partitioning V into a maximal number of disjoint zero-sum subsets, more formally V = P1 ∪ . . . ∪ Pmax, ∑\nu∈Pi\nD(u) = 0, ∀i = 1,max and Pi ∩ Pj = ∅, ∀i, j =\n1,max, i 6= j. The reason for this is, that all the debts in a zero-sum subset Pi can be cleared by |Pi| − 1 transactions by Theorem 4, thus to clear all the debts, |V | −max transactions are necessary."

      "text" : "lem\nWe use the reformulation of the problem described in Section 3.\nRepresentation A solution of the problem is represented by a permutation of the D values of V , the set of nodes. Thus a candidate solution is a vector C = (c1, c2, . . . , cn), such that ci = D(u), ∀i ∈ 1, n for some unique u ∈ V .\nFor instance C = (3, 0,−7, 4, 0) is a chromosome representing a candidate solution for the D values from Figure 3.\nThe idea of permutation representations is used intensively in solutions of the Traveling Salesman Problem ([2, 5, 10]).\nFitness assignment To evaluate the fitness of a chromosome, we iterate over the genes of the chromosome in increasing order and maintain the partial sum obtained so far, that is si = i∑\nj=1\ncj . For every si = 0, we have found a new zero-\nsum subset of the partition (starting after the last encountered partial sum equal to zero and ending at i), so we can add one to the fitness of the chromosome.\nFor instance if we have C = (−3, 2, 1,−5, 5), then s = (−3,−1, 0,−5, 0), so the fitness of C will be 2, corresponding to the partition formed by the first three elements and the last two elements.\nRecombination Various operators for permutation representations are discussed in [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10]. We propose new recombination operators.\nRecomb1 Let C1 and C2 be the two chromosomes, and k ∈ [1, n] a random crossover point. Then, the first descendant C′\n1 can be obtained by copying the\nfirst k genes from C1 and appending to it the elements of the permutation not used so far in the same order as they appear in C2. The second descendant C ′\n2\nis obtained symmetrically. For instance,\nk = 2 C1 = (−3,2, 1,−5, 5) C2 = (−5,2, 1,−3, 5) ↓ C′\n1 = (−3,2,−5, 1, 5) C′ 2 = (−5,2,−3, 1, 5)\nRecomb2 The problem with Recomb1 is, that the first descendant inherits most of its properties from C1 and very little from C2. Symmetrically C ′\n2 inherits most of its properties from C2 and very little from C1. This is undesirable, as both C1 and C2 can contain subsets from the optimal partition.\nA better recombination operator may be the following. First, determine the partitions codified by C1 and C2, as described at the evaluation of the fitness function. Let those be C1 = P1,1∪P1,2∪ . . . and C2 = P2,1∪P2,2∪ . . .. Initialize C′\n1 := C1 and C\n′ 2 := C2.\nThen, iterate over every P1,i. If some P1,i is contained in some P2,j , that is P1,i ⊂ P2,j , replace P2,j in the second descendant with P1,i ∪ (P2,j \\ P1,i). Repeat the same procedure for C2 symmetrically.\nFor instance,\nC1 = (−3, 2, 1,−5, 5) = {−3, 2, 1} ∪ {−5, 5} C2 = (2, 1, 5,−5,−3) = {2, 1, 5,−5,−3} ↓ C′\n1 = {−3, 2, 1} ∪ {−5, 5} = (−3, 2, 1,−5, 5) C′ 2 = {−3, 2, 1} ∪ {5,−5} = (−3, 2, 1, 5,−5)\nMutation Two new mutation operators are proposed, having the property, that the fitness of the chromosome does not decrease.\nMut1 The inversion operator described by Holland ([4]) can be used without modification, on the sequence between the ith and jth elements.\nFor instance,\ni = 2, j = 5 C = (−3,2,1,−5,5) ↓ C′ = (−3,5,−5,1,2)\nMut2 Mut1 can be used on the partition C = P1 ∪ P2 ∪ . . . instead of the permutation representation. This method guarantees that the fitness of the chromosome does not decrease.\nFor instance,\ni = 1, j = 4 C = (−2, 2, 3, 4,−7, 1,−1, 6,−3, 2,−5) =\n{−2,2} ∪ {3,4,−7} ∪ {1,−1} ∪ {6,−3,2,−5} ↓\nC′ = {6,−3,2,−5} ∪ {1,−1} ∪ {3,4,−7} ∪ {−2,2} = (6,−3, 2,−5, 1,−1, 3, 4,−7,−2, 2)\nMut3 Mut1 can also be used inside some Pk without decreasing the fitness. For instance,\nk = 4, i = 1, j = 4 C = (−2, 2, 3, 4,−7, 1,−1, 6,−3, 2,−5) =\n{−2, 2} ∪ {3, 4,−7} ∪ {1,−1} ∪ {6,−3,2,−5} ↓\nC′ = {−2, 2} ∪ {3, 4,−7} ∪ {1,−1} ∪ {−5,2,−3,6} = (−2, 2, 3, 4,−7, 1,−1,−5, 2,−3, 6)"

      "text" : "lem\nBecause of the strongly NP-hardness of the problem, it is challenging to generate large test cases for which information about the optimal solution is known. We describe five methods to generate large test cases.\nMethod 1 If the optimal solution for some input is known, padding the set of D values with k zeros increases the optimal solution also by k.\nMethod 2 Method 1 can be modified by padding the input with k pairs of the structure (x,−x).\nMethod 3 If the number of negative (or positive) numbers is two, the problem is equivalent to the Subset Sum problem and is solvable in pseudopolynomial time by dynamic programming. Using this method we can generate inputs for which the optimal solution is unique, that is, there is a single subset of positive (negative) numbers having the sum equal to one of the two negative (positive) numbers (in absolute value). An optimal answer for such an input is expected to be difficult to find for our evolutionary approach, as in the worst case (when the cardinality of the subset is n/2) only 2 · (n\n2 !)2 out of the n!\npossible permutations do represent an optimal solution. For n = 10, this means that the ratio of optimal solutions and all solutions is about 7.9 ·10−3, while for n = 100 the ratio is about 1.9 · 10−29.\nThis idea can be extended for any fixed number of negative (positive) numbers, but the running time of the dynamic programming solution raises quickly.\nMethod 4 Let n be the desired size of the input and l ≤ ⌊n/2⌋ an integer. First generate randomly a set of n−l elements, containing only positiveD values and l distinct integers from the [1, n − l] range (denoted r1 < . . . < rl). Let s be the vector of partial sums, that is si = i∑\nj=1\nD(j), ∀i = 1, n− l (we assume\ns0 = 0 and r0 = 0). For every ri, ∀i = 1, l insert −(sri − sri−1) to the set. In other words we insert with a negative sign the sum of l partial sequences, whose borders are denoted by ri−1 and ri. By this method we can get the optimal solution to be equal to l. As the range of the possible values of the first n − l positive elements gets bigger, we expect the optimal solution to be harder and harder to find. The reason is, that the probability to get the same sum from a different combination of positive numbers gets smaller, thus the number of genetic representations corresponding to an optimal solution decreases.\nMethod 5 It can be easily seen, that if the optimal solution for a set V is known to be max, then the solution for V ∪ V will be 2 ·max, the solution for V ∪ V ∪ V will be 3 ·max and so on."

      "text" : "In the first set of experiments our goal was to determine which combinations of our recombination and mutation operators work best in practice, along with desirable values for mutation probability. We constructed three test cases (debt100a, debt100b and debt100c) with different structures, all of them having n = 100.\ndebt100a was obtained by concatenating the test case from the initial 15 that was the most difficult to solve for the genetic algorithm (case 15) five times to itself. By the observation above in Method 5, the optimal solution for this test case is max = 25.\nTo generate debt100b we used Method 3 for n = 50 and concatenated the obtained set once to itself, thus obtaining a case having max = 4 by the observation above.\nTo obtain debt100c we first generated using a dynamic programming algorithm a set having 20 elements, which can be uniquely partitioned into three zero-sum subsets (and no more). Then we concatenated this set five times to itself, yielding max = 15 for this test case.\nFor each of the three described test cases we used the following methodology. For every possible combination of recombination and mutation operators we fixed the mutation probability to every value from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.1 and executed the genetic algorithm 10 times. We recorded the best solution obtained among the 10 executions, the average of the 10 best values and the average fitness of all genomes. In each case the population size was set to 100 individuals and the number of generations to 1000. The best five individuals always survived to the next generation.\nTo assess the efficacy of our algorithm we compared it to an algorithm called RandomSearch, which works by generating an independent random solution in every generation for every chromosome. In our case this meant generating 100000 random solutions and remembering the one with the maximum fitness value among them.\nThe results of the first set of experiments were the following:\n• debt100c was the most difficult of the three test cases used, no algorithm being able to find the optimal solution max = 15. The best solution found by RandomSearch was 5, and the best solution found by the evolutionary algorithms was 13, using Recomb2 along with Mut1 with a mutation probability ranging from 0.8 to 1. The average fitness of all genomes was maximal at mutation probability 0.7.\n• debt100b was the easiest of the test cases, our genetic algorithm being able to find the optimal solution max = 4 in the majority of the cases (in about 76% of the possible combinations of recombination and mutation operators and mutation probabilities). Mutation probability 0.7 along with Recomb2 and Mut1 maximized the average fitness again. The best solution found by RandomSearch was 3.\n• For debt100a RandomSearch was able to find a solution with fitness 9. Our genetic algorithm found the optimal solution 25 in a small percentage of the cases, using the same parameters that yielded the best solutions for debt100c. Maximal average fitness was obtained with mutation probability 0.4 using Recomb2 and Mut1.\nWe can draw the conclusion, that our genetic algorithm is much more efficient than generating random solutions. The results suggest, that using Recomb2 with Mut1 works best in practice for a wide range of inputs. On the other hand we note, that Recomb2 and Mut2 is a particularly bad combination, the reason being, that it does not allow the exploration of a sufficient varied range of solutions, because neither of the operators is able to introduce new partition sets into the population. Still, Mut2 works fairly well together with Recomb1, as the latter is capable of constructing new partition sets."

We executed our genetic algorithm using Recomb2 and Mut1 with a mutation probability of 0.75. The population size was set to 80 and the best five individuals were always promoted to the next generation. The algorithm was executed once for 50000 generations, and the fitness of the best chromosome was recorded every 100 generations.\nThe results are depicted in Figures 5, 6 and 7. We can observe that in every case the fitness of the best individual raises sharply in the first 5000 generations, then slows down gradually. 50000 generations were enough to find a solution having fitness 244 (97.6% of the optimum) for debt1000a and a solution having fitness 39 (97.5% of the optimum) for debt1000b.

The only known algorithms to solve the problem were the ones presented in [6] and [7], which are exact algorithms that provide the optimal solution always, but their running time is practical only for small inputs (n ≤ 20).\nUsing an equivalent problem we described an evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem and made extensive experiments to assess its efficacy. From the experiments we concluded, that our algorithm is much more efficient than a random search in the space of the solutions. Our algorithm is capable of finding the optimal solution for the most difficult test cases with sizes up to n = 100 in a matter of minutes. For cases as large as n = 1000 our approach remains practical, as it can obtain solutions in the range of 80% - 98% compared to the optimal solution in about an hour on a personal computer. In comparison a random search does not go above 15% even for the easiest cases of this size."
