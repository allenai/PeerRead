      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Indonesia is one of the big democratic nation. Almost everyday there are news about politician that cover many topics include corruption and regional election. Mass media has important role in delivering news therefore can influence public opinion. For example, one news media give positive review on one candidate while others give negative one.\nNowadays news media can deliver their content through digital media. This accessibility opens new opportunity to analyze news content with text mining. Digital news media can be considered as unstructured data. This huge amount of data available on the web creates today an information overloading problem [5].\nText mining has been implemented in many applications such as [1,2,3,4,6,8]. One of the suggested implementation is for analyzing readers’ sentiment on some particular news. Research result by [1] suggest that naïve Bayesian classifier and support vector machines can be used to identify readers opinion, either positive or negative, on English movie’s review and Indonesian daily news.\nThis paper suggests a method to implement sentiment’s analysis using naïve Bayesian method on digital articles and newspapers. The sentiment analysis focuses on the probability of whether news media give positive or negative review on some particular political figures."

      "text" : "The model starts from what has been suggested in [2] that consider “who” is speaking, “to whom” is speaking, and “what” as variables. This paper adopts those variables and uses them to determined sentiment probability. The values of those variables are updated according to what the system has learned from training data . Variables “who” ( ), “whom\" ( ) and “what” ( ) store their values in a form of matrix and as knowledge base set. is used to stores prior polarity ( ) of towards , and stores how many times give such statement toward ( ). The default values are\n. These values change with\nso when\n(1)\nTraining data is a list of independent articles . Each articles can contains one or more political\nfigures “keyword”, therefore\n(2)\nThe sentiment of article is cast by and\nin . Each is determined by the value\nof which correspond to unique word in database\n. and are handled as a token like in [3,7].\ncan be “negative” words ( ) such as corruption, convict, and dispute, or “positive” words ( ) like honest, improve, and hope. Each appearance of\nwill also increase value of by one. If\neach have a value of integer then\nversion.\n(3)\nValues of are stored in matrices of\nmatrix and value of are stored in\nmatrices of matrix . is the “who” where the statement come from in a article , and is the “to whom” or “to who” give his/her statement to. Since there are many combinations of structures in a sentence then seven assumptions will be set and used through out this paper.\nAssumption 1 There are only two types of articles in the news, first is articles which discuss about one or more politician, and second articles that do not say anything about politician (even though the article is about politic). This assumption will hold true equation (2) since all articles that discuss one or more politician will have and the others .\nAssumption 2 For each statement there are always person who declares, and person whose the are declared to. Thus whether exist and then there is always , and whether exist and then there is always . This assumption makes sure that change in will always by the value of , and\nalways have references to .\nAssumption 3 Though assumption 2 will hold for most statements in , there are some possibilities that it will not. There are some cases where there is no reference of but is present, such may happen in the first sentence of . Assumption 3 will guarantee that assumption 2 will always be true by assigning to the news media where the article appears, hence the default value of\n.\nAssumption 4 Article can have two or more and therefore the system keep track of and by\nchanging their values to the most recent politician keyword found. For example let say is words in\nthen and\n(4)\nThis assumption ensure that each give the correct\nto .\nAssumption 5 Every negation keyword ( ) in a sentence such as “no” and “not” will change the polarity of thus change value of for to . If\nthere exist two or more in one sentence then polarity of will be changed as many times as appear.\nAssumption 6 To distinguish between and sarcasm, the system check withthe value of prior . If\nthen the will be considered as\nsarcasm, otherwise it will be considered as legitimate positive statement.Polarity of will not be changed thus will be added to .\nAssumption 7 This paper assumes that all news media have some sentiment tendency towards politician. Therefore each in which correspond to change the probable polarity of news media towards\n. Thus for every will change with\nthe same value of and increase by one.\n3. TRAINING SET AND NAIVE BAYESIANMODEL\nTraining set consists of therefore\nand or . To\nfind out whether a news media give positive or negative review on particular politician, this paper adapts Bayesian model from [1,4,11] and modify it so\n(5)\nwhere is the probability of in\ngiven event . Since can be either has\npositive value or negative value and\nthen . When\nthen tends to give negative\nreview on , where states\notherwise. For example when\nmeans that has 95% probability to has\nversion.\nnegative sentiment towards . Thus the probability of sentiment polarity of article towards is\n(6)\nFollowing equation (3) then positive value\nwill add value, and negative will subtract\nvalue. Hence equation (1) concludes that the\nfurther away value from then the higher\nprobability of has sentiment (either positive or negative) towards .\nInitial values of all cells in figure 1 are 0. The values will change after the system goes through . Each cell stores historical data of sentiment towards . Number of and do not have to be equal. It is possible that in a case of\ngive a statement about him/her self.\nMatrix has the same structure as matrix\nwith the difference cells. In matrix , values\nof are substituted with values of ."

      "heading" : "4. SYSTEM DESIGN AND TEST MODEL",
      "text" : "This paper creates a system design to test the model. The test will use articles from Indonesia‟s digital newspaper to create . To test the accuracy, the system will try to determine\nfrom another article . Set of\nand are determined beforehand by human\ninterpreter.\nBefore the test, a general system flow is established. The general system flow consists of five modules which are reader and parser, cleanser, helper, analyzer, and display. Reader and parser separate each words and punctuation mark from the text. Then these words will be filtered by cleanser. The filter removes special words and adverbs from the sentence by comparing them with a set of pre define filter words such as „seorang‟ ( „a‟, „an‟ in English) ,‟adalah‟ („is‟ in English), ‟yang‟ („that‟ in English). As example a sentence like „ABC adalah seorang\nkoruptor‟ (ABC is an corruptor) will become „ABC koruptor‟.\nSentences that have been cleansed will be scanned by helper to find non-common pronoun or politician names such as alias or pronoun. This module will change those words and replace them with system‟s keywords. These keywords will be used by analyzer to locate , , and .\nThe system reads all sentences separately hence all sentences are evaluated independently. Analyzer process will be triggered by a condition where the system found special word. These special words can be categorized into negative and positive types.\nFigure 3 is process flow when the system found negative word like koruptor („corruptor‟ in English), and tersangka („suspect‟ in English).The result of process in figure 3 are , and .\nUsing this result system can create matrix M and N.\nThe process flow of positive type is similar to the process flow of negative type. The only different is that the keywords and the opposite value (+1) to be assigned for positive words.\nversion.\nThe algorithm is tested using Java and MySQL database to save the data. The test uses articles from K digital newspaper as training data T and evaluated articles .\nFrom , the system form matrix and with\nand . is\nthe default value which equals to .\nFigure 4 shows the result of\n,\n,\n, and . By\nemploying formula (6) then ,\n, and . Thus it means\nthat this particular article from has probability of 100% giving negative sentiment to Andi and Deddy, and has probability of 100% giving positive sentiment to . These result will be saved as system‟s knowledge base and will be used to analyze .\nversion.\nFigure 5. Result after running\nwill be calculated proportional to\nsubsequently\n. Then it signifies has 25% probability to\nhave negative sentiment to Andi. Thus in general we get\n(7)"

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "The model proposed in this paper can be used to analyze sentiment of an article in digital news media towards politician. The algorithm in the model is fairly general to be used in many other sentiment analysis problems with only few modifications. The prompt test shows promising results, nevertheless further test with bigger data set and more complex slang language yet has to be done.\nOne major problem in applying this model is to accurately identify the „who‟ and the „whom‟ in the articles on precise context. Finding meaning in context behind each sentence and associate it with whole articles‟ context is still a challenge for the future.\nREFERENCE\n[1] N.W.S Saraswati, Text Mining Dengan\nMetode Naïve Bayes Classifier Dan Support Vector Machines Untuk Sentiment Analysis, Thesis, Program Magister Program Studi Teknik Elektro, Universitas Udayana, Denpasar, 2011.\n[2] F.
