To address this issue, traditional unsupervised signal processing methods seem to have touched the ceiling. However, data-driven based supervised approaches, particularly the ones designed with deep learning, have recently emerged as potential alternatives. In this light, we are going to comprehensively summarise the recently developed and most representative deep learning approaches to deal with the raised problem in this article, with the aim of providing guidelines for those who are going deeply into the field of environmentally robust speech recognition. To better introduce these approaches, we categorise them into single- and multi-channel techniques, each of which is specifically described at the front-end, the back-end, and the joint framework of speech recognition systems. In the meanwhile, we describe the pros and cons of these approaches as well as the relationships among them, which can probably benefit future research."

      "text" : "Recently, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has achieved tremendous success in both academic and industrial areas [1, 2, 3]. A large amount of relevant applications have started to become as an important part of our daily life, including various smartphone assistants (e. g., Siri, Cortana, Google Now), Amazon echo, kinect Xbox, and the like. However, one of the vital issues which severely degrades their performance in real life relates to the corruption effect of various environmental noises on speech.\nThe ambient noises that widely corrupt the clean speech s(t) in the realistic scenarios mainly include i) various additive noises a(t), such as stationary white noise (e. g., constant hum from machinery), and non-stationary interfering talking, music, and natural sounds; and ii) non-stationary convolutional noise r(t) that is largely caused by the room reverberation and the propagation channels. Hence, the distorted speech y(t) can be expressed as\ny(t) = s(t) ∗ r(t) + a(t), (1)\nwhere t denotes the time index. Provided that it is possible to reliably detect instants of the absence of the target signal (i. e., the speech of interest), short-term stationary additive noise can be adequately tackled with standard, unsupervised noise reduction signal processing techniques developed in the 1970s and 1980s [4]. However, detecting and reducing the impact of unknown non-stationary noise, or competing non-stationary sound sources, is still very challenging in practice, owing to the unstable characteristics of non-stationary noise [5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nTo overcome this problem, a new wave of research efforts have been made over the past few years, for example,\nthe organisations of REVERB and a series of CHiME challenges [7, 10, 8, 6]. In such a new research stage, data-driven based approaches in a supervised machine learning paradigm has received increased attention, and have emerged as influential alternatives for enhancing the noise-robustness (i. e., nonstationary noise) of ASR systems [11]. The primary objective of these approaches is, via learning from large amounts of training data, to either obtain cleaner speech signals or features from noisy speech, or directly explore the discriminating phoneme representations from noisy speech. To this end, a revolutionary technique called deep learning has particularly played a central role in the recent developments [12, 13, 14]. The essential idea of deep learning is to extract high-level and complex abstractions of data by using neural networks in a deep structure (i. e., multiple layers). Deep learning has been repeatedly verified to be powerful in making use of massive training data to build complex and dedicated analysis systems, and has achieved considerable success in a variety of fields, such as gaming [15], visual recognition [16], language translation [17], and ASR [18, 19]. All these achievements have leveraged increasing research efforts on deep learning to efficiently improve the robustness of ASR in noisy environments.\nIn this survey, we provide a systematic overview of relevant deep learning approaches that are designed to address the noise robustness problem for speech recognition. Rather than enumerating all related approaches, we endeavour to establish a taxonomy of the most promising approaches, which are categorised by the two principles: i) According to the addressed channel number, the approaches can be grouped into singlechannel and multi-channel techniques. ii) According to the processing stages where deep learning is applied to, these ap-\nPreprint submitted to ** June 1, 2017\nproaches can be generally classified into front-end, back-end, and joint front- and back-end techniques (as shown in Fig. 1). We then highlight their advantages and disadvantages, and establish their interrelations and distinctions among the prominent techniques.\nWhilst several related surveys are available in the literature (e. g., [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 5]), all these works have no focus on the usage of deep learning. This point, however, is deemed as one of the most considerable advances for the addressed problem in recent years, and forms the key concentration of this survey.\nThe remainder of this article is organised as follows. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the principle of some basic neural networks. In Sections 3 to 5, we comprehensively summarise the representative single-channel algorithms at the front-end, the back-end, and the joint front- and back-end of speech recognition systems, respectively. In Section 6, we then review the most promising multi-channel algorithms, before drawing the conclusions in Section 7."

      "text" : "Before going deeply into the review, we shortly describe the widely used neural networks for deep learning as priori knowledge. These neural networks mainly include Deep Boltzmann Machines, Stacked Autoencoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks. For more details about these networks, the reader is referred to [25] and [26].\n2.1. Deep Boltzmann Machines and Stacked Autoencoders\nTwo of the most popular architectures at the early development stage of deep learning are Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs) [27] and Stacked AutoEncoders (SAEs) [28]. Each of these is obtained by stacking multiple layers of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) or feedforward autoencoders, respectively. The essential idea of these networks is to utilise deep architectures to model the complex and potentially non-linear functions that represent high-level abstractions, via an unsupervised pre-training in a greedy layerwise fashion [27, 29]. Each layer is trained with an encoder f (·) and a decoder g(·) by minimising the reconstruction error for its input y:\ng( f (y)) ≈ y. (2)\nThe output of the encoder f (y) forms an alternative representation of the input y, and is then fed into a successive layer as input. This procedure is repeated layer-by-layer until all predefined layers are initialised. Training the stacked layers in this manner allows a deep network to incrementally learn a representation that is more robust than the one learnt by training the whole network in ensemble from a random initialisation of weights. For a detailed description as to why pre-training autoencoders yields better performance, the reader is referred to [30]. An extension of SAE is Stacked Denoising AutoEncoder (SDAE) [31, 32], where the initial inputs y are corrupted into a partially destroyed version ỹ by means of stochastic mapping ỹ ∼ qd (̃y|y). By doing this, the generative capability of the high-level representations is improved [31, 32].\nFurther, a variation of DBMs is Deep Belief Network (DBNs). Different from DBMs of which all connections are undirected, the top two layers of DBNs form an undirected graph and the remaining layers form a belief net with directed top-down connections [33]. In this article, unless otherwise stated the term Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) particularly refers to as DBMs or DBNs.\n2.2. Recurrent Neural Networks\nIn contrast to the aforementioned neural networks, where connections are only available between two adjacent layers, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) allow cyclical connections. These connections consequently endow the RNNs with the capability of accessing previously processed inputs. That is, the hidden state st at time step t is obtained by the previous hidden state st−1 at time step t − 1 and the input yt at the time step t:\nst = f (Uyt +Wst−1), (3)\nwhereU andW are the associated weight matrices; the function f is usually a nonlinearity, such as tanh, sigmoid, or ReLU.\nThe standard RNNs, however, cannot access long-range context since the backpropagated error when training either blows up or decays over time (the vanishing gradient problem) [34]. To overcome this limitation, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber introduced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) RNNs [34], which are able to store the information in memory cells over a long period. The LSTM-RNNs replace the traditional neurons of RNNs by so-called memory blocks. Analogous to the cyclic connections in RNNs, these memory blocks are recurrently connected. Every memory block consists of self-connected linear memory cells and three multiplicative gate units: input, output, and forget gates. The input and output gates scale the input and output of the cell, respectively, while the forget gate scales the internal state. In other words, the input, output, and forget gates are responsible for writing, reading, and resetting the memory cell values, respectively. Therefore, LSTMRNNs could also be regarded as a natural extension of deep neural networks for temporal sequential data, where the deepness comes from layers through time. Furthermore, similar to the DBM and the SAE, stacking RNN blocks into a deep structure has attracted increased attention, leading to a Deep RNN (DRNN) [35].\n2.3. Convolutional Neural Networks\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a biologically inspired variant of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) originally developed for visual perception tasks [36, 37, 38]. It consists of one, or more, convolutional layers (often with a pooling layer), and then followed by one or more fully connected layers.\nTypically, convolutional layer is referred to as feature extraction layer; it includes multiple filters (aka kernels), the size of which is normally much smaller than the dimension of the input. Each neuron of the filter is connected with a local receptive field of previous layers and extracts a local feature representation. Each of the filter is convolved with the input, giving rise to produce multiple corresponding feature maps. The feature maps are then subsampled, typically with mean or max pooling, over other small regions to reduce the feature dimension. Several such convolutional and subsample layers are concatenated in a deep structure, finally followed by fully connected layers for classification or regression. One of the advantages of CNN is that it can extract efficient features by automatic learning. For speech processing, as the time-series property of speech, 1D filter instead of 2D filter is usually considered to take input samples."

      "text" : "The block diagram of single-channel based ASR front-end is illustrated in Fig. 2. It is given the noisy speech signal y(t), which is obtained from the clean speech s(t) corrupted by the convolutional noise r(t) and the additive noise a(t) (as shown in Eq. (1)). Then, the mixed noisy signal y(t) is preprocessed for framing, etc. After that, a series of processes is executed to extract the features of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for speech recognition, including Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), square magnitude, Mel-frequency filterbank, log Mel-frequency filterbank, and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). For better introduction of related approaches, we separately term the data spaces after each processing stage as temporal, Time-Frequency (T-F) spectral, power spectral, Mel spectral, logMel spectral, and cepstral domains.\nIn such a set of processes, enhancement techniques can be theoretically applied to each domain, i. e., from the raw signal in the temporal domain to the MFCCs in the cepstral domain. The enhancement techniques often relate to speech enhancement, source separation, and feature enhancement. Specifically, the objective of speech enhancement is to improve the quality and intelligibility of the estimated target speech ŝ(t); whilst source separation aims to split multiple mixed sources so as to acquire multiple independent speech sources (e. g., speakers). Thus, source separation can be viewed as a specific case of\nspeech enhancement, where all other interfering sound sources are regarded as noise. Both speech enhancement and source separation attempt to obtain the estimated temporal signals as clean as possible, which can certainly be used for any speech applications like teleconferencing. Feature enhancement, however, mainly focuses on purifying the derived distorted features, such as MFCCs, which are largely designed for specific intelligent tasks (i. e., ASR here). In this survey, we unified all three terms as enhancement techniques, as they often share the same or similar algorithms.\nBefore discussing the deep-learning based enhancement methods at length, we introduce the most common objective performancemeasures for speech enhancement and source separation, and briefly review the central traditional enhancement techniques as priori knowledge.\n3.1. Objective Measures\nThe de facto standard metric to evaluate the ASR system performance is the Word Error Rate (WER). However, for speech enhancement and source separation, there are several independent ways available for evaluating the quality and intelligibility of enhanced speech. The most general and reliable way is performing subjective listening tests [39]. This method, however, is notoriously expensive and time consuming. For this reason, the research community established a variety of objectivemeasurements to quantify the similarity of the enhanced and the original speech [40, 41, 42, 4].\nSpecifically, segmental Signal-to-Noise Ratio (segSNR) is one of the most popular objective measures [40, 41]. Rather than working on the whole signal, segSNR averages the SNRs over speech segments calculates the average of the SNR values over segments of the speech signals. Compared with SNR, segSNR gives better results for waveform encoders. In addition, distance measures are used to evaluate the difference between the clean and enhanced (or noisy) signal in different representation domains (e. g., spectral or cepstral); and Source-toDistortion Ratio (SDR) is also frequently used in evaluating the performance of source separation algorithms [43]. Further, Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) [44, 45] is a test methodology developed for quality assessment of telephoneband speech. It makes use of psychoacoustic models and has been widely adopted for speech quality assessment in place of subjective listening tests. It has also shown some potential in predicting speech intelligibility but this appears to depend on the noise conditions [46].\n3.2. Traditional Enhancement Techniques\nAutomatic removal of non-stationary noise is a central task in speech enhancement and many unsupervised signal processing\nmethods have been developed for it [4]. The advantage of these methods over supervised approaches is that they do not require training with noisy speech and an exactly corresponding clean target. In the context of this survey, however, we generally assume that such training material with the expected type of noise is available.\nIn general, these unsupervised algorithms model the noise based on the same noisy inputs that they aim to enhance. The simplest approach to automatically constructing a noise model is by means of a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) such that the noise model is updated during non-active segments. As the performance of the unsupervised noise reduction methods is strongly affected by the noise modelling approach, more sophisticated noise estimation techniques have also been developed, that track spectral minima also during speech activity [47, 48].\nWhilst an instantaneous representation of the noise is obtained, noise reduction methods typically use it to construct an enhancement filter in order to remove the noise in each shortterm analysis frame, and then combine the enhanced frames by the overlap-add method [49] in order to resynthesise the (enhanced) signal. Classical single-channel noise reduction methods include variants of spectral subtraction [50, 51, 52], where an averaged noise spectrum (magnitude or power spectrum) is subtracted from the noisy signal spectrum, while keeping the resultant spectral magnitudes positive. Spectral subtraction only affects the spectrum magnitudes, while the spectrum phases are obtained from the noisy signal. While spectral subtractive methods rely on deterministic noise models, Wiener filtering [4] adopts stochastic models and is often implemented in practice using iterative approaches which base new estimates of the Wiener filter on the enhanced signal obtained by the previous iteration’s Wiener filter estimate [53]. Noniterative approaches based on a priori SNR estimation have also been developed for implementing Wiener filtering [54, 55, 4]. Another popular family of techniques comprises the minimum mean square error (MMSE) [56] and log-spectral amplitude MMSE (LogMMSE) short-time spectral amplitude (STSA) estimators [57]. Their performance is still considered to be among the best of the published general-purpose speech noise reduction methods [58] and in comparison to many other such methods, they exhibit lower amounts of musical noise (spectral components left as residual after enhancement) [59]. In part, this can be attributed to the temporal smoothing of their “decision-directed” estimation approach, where the spectral estimate of each frame is based partially on the estimates from previous frames via the a priori SNR estimate updated by using a memory coefficient [59, 54, 55]. More recently, spectral subtraction [60] and the decision-directed MMSE [58] methods have also been applied in the spectral modulation domain in order to better handle nonstationary noise.\nParticularly, a supervised learning-based method, namely Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF), was recently frequently utilised [61]. The main idea is to find a dictionary (basis) matrix W and an activation matrix H, so that their multiplications can be used to represent the original matrix V of noisy speech spectrum, i. e., V ≈ WH, where both W and H are with\na constraint of non-negativity. The columns of W are dictionary atoms w, representing the spectra of acoustic events. To enhance the target speech, the dictionaries of speech and noise are separately trained on clean speech and noise only [62, 63]. Nevertheless, it is noted that it highly relies on the assumption that the training speech or noise are in the same acoustic distribution with the unseen speech and noise data. To improve the generalisation ability, an exemplar-based approach has been proposed to obtain larger dictionaries [64], which is designed to cover multiple speakers and pronunciation variants in a speech dictionary. In realistic scenarios, the applied environments or the speakers may vary and are not easy to be predicted. A compromise solution to address this issue is semi-supervised NMF [65]. That is, either the speech dictionary or the noise dictionary is pre-defined in the training stage. Then, in the test time, it estimates the unknown dictionary Wi for the source i alongside with the activations H of all dictionary atoms. This method has been examined in [66, 67], and has shown its efficiency.\n3.3. Deep-Learning-based Enhancement Techniques\nFor better reviewing, we set the input of learning model (i. e., deep neural networks) as y that is extracted from noisy speech, and the target as x. Based on the types of training target x, the enhancementmethods can be categorised into i)mapping-based methods and ii) masking-basedmethods.\n3.3.1. Mapping-based Methods\nThe mapping-basedmethods is to learn a non-linear mapping function from the observed noisy speech y(t) into the desired clean speech s(t), as\ny(t) F −→ s(t), (4)\nwhere F is the learnt mapping function. Owing to the highdimension and fast-variation problems of raw speech signals, such a learning strategy is often applied to the spectral and cepstral domains rather than the temporal domain. That is, the data used for network training can be absolute magnitude Y(n), power magnitude |Y(n)|2, Mel-frequency filterbank Ymel(n), log Mel-frequency filterbank Y logMel(n), or MFCC Ym fcc(n), as shown in Fig. 2. In doing this, the data dimensions can be significantly reduced, leading to less computational complexity.\nTo learn F, the neural network is trained to reconstruct the target features x (extracted from the clean speech s(t)) from the corresponding input features y (extracted from the corrupted speech y(t)). The parameters of the model θ are determined by minimising the objective function of Mean Squared Error (MSE):\nJ(θ) = 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n‖F(yn) − xn‖ 2, (5)\nwhere ‖·‖2 is the squared loss, and n denotes the frame index. After the estimated clean features x̂n = F(yn) obtained, they will be then inversed back to the time-domain signal ŝ(t) by using the phase information from original noisy speech, and evaluated by the objective measures as mentioned in Section 3.1.\n1) Based on SAE or DBM: Specifically, in 2013 Lu et al. [68] employed SAE to map the noisy speech to the clean speech in the Mel spectral domain. Given an AE that includes one non-linear encoding stage and one linear decoding stage for real valued speech as\nh(y) = g(W1y + b)\nx̂ = W2h(y) + b, (6)\nwhere W1 and W2 are the weight matrices of encoding and decoding, b is the bias, and g denotes the activation function. The training pair for the first AE is y and x, and then the training pair for the next AE will be h(y) and h(x) if weight matrices of encoder and decoder are tied, i. e., W1 = W T 2 = W. The empirical results indicate that SAE-based enhancement method notablely outperforms the traditional method like MMSE for enhancing the speech distorted by factory and car noises [68].\nAnalogous to this, another successful work has been done in [69], where DBM was utilised to estimate the complex mapping function. In the pre-training stage, noisy speech was used to train RBMs layer-by-layer in a standard unsupervised greedy fashion to obtain a deep generative model [29]; whereas in the fine-tuning process, the desired clean speech was set as to the target by minimising the objective function as Eq. (13). Similar research efforts were also extensively made on the T-F [70] and the logMel spectrum domains [71], respectively.\nMotivated by the fact that the same distortion in different frequency bands has different effects on speech quality, a weighted SAE was proposed in [72] which has shown positive performance for denoising. In detail, a weighted reconstruction loss function is employed to train SAE on the power spectrum as\nJ(θ) = 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\nλw‖F(yn) − xn‖ 2, (7)\nwhere λ is the weighting function.\nFurther, similar work was also done in [73] and [74], where the authors utilised SDAE to enhance the Mel filterbank features corrupted by either additive or convolutional noise for ASR. The networks were pre-trained with multi-condition data, and fine-tuned by mapping the noisy speech to the clean speech. The experiments conducted on CENSREC-4 database indicate that the SDAE-based mapping method remarkably outperforms the spectral subtraction method [73] in ASR.\n2) Based on LSTM-RNN: For the mapping-based speech enhancement, context information of speech and noise is considered to be important [75]. However, the aforementioned networks (i. e., SAE, DBM, and SDAE) are evaluated to be less capable in this aspect, although certain naive solutions were performed, such as expanding several sequential frames as a long vector input [69]. RNN, espcially the ones equiped with LSTM blocks (namely LSTM-RNN), has been frequently verified to be highly capable of capturing the context information in long sequence [76, 77], as mentioned in Section 2.2.\nIn this light, Maas et al. [11] introduced RNN to purify the input features (i. e., MFCCs). Specifically, the model was trained to predict clean features given noisy input frame by frame.\nEvaluated by ASR systems, this enhancement model is shown to be competitive with other DNN-based mapping models at various levels of SNR [11]. Following this work, Wöllmer et al. [78] proposed to use LSTM-RNN to handle highly nonstationary additive noise, which was then extended to cope with reverberation in [13, 79, 80, 81, 82]. With the help of LSTMRNN, the speech recognition systems performmuch better than the one without LSTM-RNN when decoding the noisy speech.\n3) Based on CNN: More recently, an interesting research topic has emerged towards automatically learning robust phoneme representations from original noisy speech. For example, Chang et al. [83] proposed a novel feature extraction framework that concatenates a CNN and a fully connected deep neural network. Specifically, Gabor filter kernels are integrated with CNN, which aims to capture the spectrotemporal receptive field as it is designed to model human auditory processing. The bottleneck features generated from the deep neural networks are then used for training traditional HiddenMarkovModel (HMM), providing superior performance on two standard noisy speech databases (i. e., Aurora-4 and noisy WSJ) [83].\n3.3.2. Masking-based Methods\nDifferent from mapping-based methods, masking-based methods aim to learn a regression function from noisy speech spectrum Y(n, f ) to T-F mask M(n, f ). That is,\nY(n, f ) F −→ M(n, f ). (8)\nGenerally, there are two typical masks available in the literature: Ideal Binary Mask (IBM) [84] and Ideal Ratio Mask (IRM) [85]. For the IBM, a T-F mask unit is set to as 1 if the the local SNR is greater than a threshold R (indicating clean speech domination), or 0 if otherwise (indicating noise domination). That is,\nMb(n, f ) =\n{ 1, if S NR(n, f ) > R,\n0, otherwise, (9)\nwhere S NR(n, f ) denotes the local SNR within the T-F unit at frame index n and frequency bin f . Hence, the IBM is a binary matrix.\nThe IBM is indeed a binary approximation to IRM. For the IRM, a T-F mask unit is assigned by the soft ratio of the clean speech energy and the noisy (mixture) speech energy, as follows:\nMs(n, f ) = |S (n, f )|2\n|S (n, f )|2 + |N(n, f )|2 , (10)\nwhere S (n, f ) and N(n, f ) are the clean speech and noise in the T-F spectral domain, respectively. Therefore, the IRM is closely related to the Wiener filter, and can be viewed as its instantaneous version.\nIn the network training stage, given the input y from the T-F spectrum of mixed noisy signals Y(n, f ) and the target x from the calculated T-F mask M(n, f ), the parameters of neural networks θ are determined by the called Mask Approximation (MA) objective function. That is, it attempts to minimise the\nMSE between the estimated mask and the target mask as follows\nJ(θ) = 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n‖F(yn) − M(n, f )‖ 2, (11)\nwhere ‖·‖2 is the squared loss, n denotes the frame index, and F(yn) is restricted to the range [0,1].\nIn the test stage, to filter out the noise, the estimated mask M̂(n, f ) = F(yn) is sequentially applied to the spectrum of the mixed noisy signal y by\nx̂n = yn ⊗ M̂(n, f ), (12)\nwhere ⊗ denotes the elementwise multiplication. After that, it transforms the estimated clean spectrum x̂ back to the timedomain signal ŝ(t) by inverse STFT.\nSpecifically, Wang and Wang [86] first introduced DNNs to perform IBM estimation for speech separation, which significantly outperforms other methods without deep learning. Subsequently, Wang et al. [87] compared a variety of masks and indicated that the IRM is superior to the IBM in terms of objective intelligibility and quality metrics. Such a conclusion was further verified by the work in [88], where the obtained results suggested that IRM achieves better ASR performance than IBM. Nevertheless, the work done by Grais et al. [89] showed that combining IBM and IRM can deliver better performance than each of them used independently for source separation.\nRather than estimating the masks in the T-F spectral domain, the masking-based approaches were also successfully applied to a reduced feature space – Mel frequency domain [90, 88] and its logarithmic scale [91] that have frequently been proven to be effective for ASR in deep learning. The experimental results in [90] showed that the masking-based approaches in the Mel frequency domain perform better than the ones in the T-F spectral domain in terms of SDR.\nFurther, another trend of the masking-based approaches towards replacing DNNs with LSTM-RNNs as the mask learning model [91, 92, 90], since LSTM-RNNs have shown to be capable of learning the speech and noise context information in a long temporal range [76, 77] which is vitally important for such a sequence learning task. The research efforts made in [90] have demonstrated the LSTM-RNNs can notably outperform the DNNs in mask estimation, as well as NMF, for source separation.\nApart from employing MA-based objective function to optimise the model, more and more studies have recently started to use Signal Approximation (SA) objective function [93, 94, 90]. Such an alternative straightforwardly targets at minimising the MSE between the estimated clean spectrum x̂ = y ⊗ F(y) and the target clean spectrum x by\nJ(θ) = 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n‖yn ⊗ F(yn) − xn‖ 2. (13)\nThis is indeed similar to the objective function used for the mapping-based methods (cf. Section 3.3.1). Empirically, employing the objective function based on SA performs better than\nthe one based on MA for source separation [90]. Moreover, the conclusions found in [90] and [95] indicated that combining the two objective functions (i. e., MA and SA) can further improve the speech enhancement performance in both the T-F and the Mel domains.\nMost of these methods, however, have only considered the magnitude or power spectrum when calculating the target ideal mask. The distorted phase information is completely ignored, even though it was proved to be helpful for speech enhancement [96]. To this end, the studies done by Erdogan et al. [97] and Weninger et al. [92] have taken the phase information into account, contributing to better performance in terms of SDR. Similarly, Williamson et al. [98] proposed complex ratio masking for DNN-based monaural speech separation, which learns the real and imaginary components of complex spectrograms jointly in the Cartesian coordinate system instead of learning magnitude spectrograms only in the traditional polar coordinate system. Notable performance improvement was observed as well.\nAdditionally, a multi-task learning framework has proposed in [93, 94] to jointly learn multiple sources (i. e., speech and noise) and the mask simultaneously. The assumption behind this idea is that the relationship between noise and its caused speech distortion could be learnt and help for estimating the clean speech. The experimental results have shown that such a joint training framework is superior to the isolated training way [93].\nAlthough the masking-based approaches were initially designed for removing additive noise, recent research has showed that they are capable of eliminating convolutional noise as well [91, 97, 92]."

      "heading" : "4. Back-End Techniques",
      "text" : "The back-end techniques are also known as model-based techniques. They leave the noisy observation unchanged, and instead let the neural networks automatically find out the relationship between the observed speech and the phonetic targets. The most widely used approach in robust ASR often involves with multi-condition training [99]. In doing this, various acoustic variations caused by different noises are provided in the training process, reducing the acoustic distribution gap between the training and the test data.\nAnother common way to compensate the acoustic distribution mismatch is model adaptation, which is performed on the pre-trained Acoustic Modelling (AM). However, modifying the entire weights of the neural networks with small adaptation data easily leads to overfitting and results in extremely large noise dependent parameter sets. Alternatively, small subsets of neural network weights can be modified. For example, the authors of the work [100] added extra layer with linear activation to the network of input, hidden layers, or output, for model adaptation, which contributes to a considerable system robustness in noisy conditions.\nRather than forcing the pre-trained AM to adapt to various noisy conditions, an alternative way aims to let the network-\nbased AM be informed about the noise information when training, which is often termed as Noise-Aware Training (NAT) [99]. In this case, a noise estimate present in the signal serves as an augmented input and is incorporate with the original observation input, i. e., [y, n̂]. In this way, the DNN is being given additional cues in order to automatically learn the relationship between noisy speech and noise in a way that is beneficial to predict phonetic target [99]. Experimental results on Aurora-4 for speech recognition showed that the DNN-based AM trained with NAT has remarkable noise robustness. A similar work was also done in [101], where the noise estimation was replaced by the room information as an augmented input for dereverberation.\nFurther, a more general way to involve with the noise information in the network input comes to employing ivector, which was originally developed for speaker recognition. In [102], Karanasou et al. introduced an i-vector to represent acoustic environment, except another conventional one for speaker. Then, the i-vectors are concatenated to the original acoustic features for every frames of the data. These expanded features form the input for neural network training and decoding. Analogous to this, Yu et al. [103] used the extracted i-vector to represent the noisy environment; however, the ivectors are calculated from the Vector Taylor Series (VTS) enhanced features and bottleneck features rather than MFCCs.\nRecently, a quite successful work was reported by [12], where a double-stream HMM architecture was used for fusing two AMs. One is traditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based AM, and other one is LSTM-RNN-based AM. Specifically, given the HMM emission state s and the input vector y, at every time frame n the double stream HMM has access to two independent information sources, pG(yn|sn) and pL(yn|sn), the acoustic likelihoods of the GMM and the LSTM predictions, respectively. Particularly, the LSTM-RNN-based AM was discriminatively trained to generate frame-wise phone prediction. The double-stream emission probability is computed as\np(yn|sn) = pG(yn|sn) λpL(yn|sn) 1−λ, (14)\nwhere the variable λ ∈ [0, 1] denotes the stream weight. With the help of LSTM-RNN-based AM, the performance of traditional GMM-HMM system is boosted for noisy speech recognition. Moreover, the effectiveness of such a system has already been shown as a winner of the second CHiME Challenge.\nFollowing research was introduced in [104] and found that the GMM-based AM is even unnecessary when the LSTM-RNN-based AM was trained to predict HMM states (i. e., senone, rather than phonemes), resulting in a hybrid LSTM/HMMmodel. That is, only the likelihoods of the LSTM predictions are employed for HMM, i. e., λ = 0.0 in Eq. (14). The work also revealed that combining the LSTM-RNN-based AM for phoneme or state predictions can further improve the performance.\nRecently, a multi-task learning based AM has attracted increasing attention. For example, the work of [101] and [105] respectively introduced similar multi-task learning architectures but different network types (i. e., one is DNN and the other one\nis LSTM-RNN) for noisy speech recognition, where the primary task is senone classification and the augmented task is reconstructing the clean speech features. In these architectures, the objective function is calculated by\nJ(θ) = λEc + (1 − λ)Er, (15)\nwhere Ec and Er indicate the senone classification error and the reconstruction error, respectively. The underlying assumption of this kind of multi-task learning is that the representations that are good for producing clean speech should be easier to classify."

      "text" : "To better take advantage of the techniques in both the frontend and the back-end, more and more interests are focusing on jointing the two. The straightforward way to do this is employing the enhanced features in the front-end for re-training the AM in the back-end [81].\nMore sophisticatedly, Lee et al. [106] proposed a cascaded DNN structure, which concatenated two independent fine-tuned DNNs. The first DNN performs the reconstruction of the clean features from noisy features augmented by the noise estimation. The second DNN attempts to learn the mapping between the reconstructed features and the phonetic targets [106]. The assumption of such a cascaded structure is that it could learn a most discriminative representation for speech recognition when reconstructing the clean feature from the noisy one by feature enhancement in the front-end.\nA similar work has also been done by Wang et al. [107], who concatenated a DNN-based speech separation front-end and a DNN-based AM back-end to build a larger neural network, and jointly adjust the weights in each model. In doing this, the separation front-end is able to provide enhanced speech desired by the AM back-end, and the AM back-end can guide the separation front-end to produce more discriminative enhancement [107].\nTo utmost explore the potential of deep neural networks at different stages in the speech recognition chain, end-to-end systems have attracted increasing interests in recent years and have achieved tremendous achievement in ASR [2, 108]. The central idea is to jointly optimise the parameters of the networks at the front-end which automatically learn the inherent representations for the task at hand, and the networks at the back-end which provide final predictions.\nA quite recent and well-developed framework was reported in [14], where two tasks were evaluated: the Aurora-4 task with multiple additive noise types and channel mismatch, and the AMI meeting transcription task with significant reverberation. In this framework, a variety of very deep CNNs with many convolutional layers were implemented, and each of them is followed by four fully connected layers and one softmax output layer for senone prediction. Compared with the feedforward DNN, the CNNs have these advantages [14]: 1) It is well suited to model the local correlations in both time and frequency in\nspeech spectrogram; 2) Translational invariance, such as frequency shift due to speaking styles or speaker variations, can be more easily captured by CNNs. The reported results on AMI by using the proposed end-to-end framework is much higher than the traditional DNN and is competitive to the LSTM-RNNbased AM, and the results on Aurora-4 achieve the best compared with any other published results on this database, even without performing any speech and feature enhancement approaches."

      "heading" : "6. Multi-Channel Techniques",
      "text" : "Recent advance in robust ASR has also highly acknowledged the practical importance of using microphone arrays and multichannel processing (cf. the recent CHiME and REVERB challenges [8, 6] and their successful contributions which introduced improvements on the multi-channel techniques over the\nbaseline, e. g., [109, 110, 111, 112]). A central technique is acoustical beamforming, i. e., spatio-temporal filtering that operates on the outputs of the microphone array and converts it to a single-channel signal while focusing on the desired speech and attenuating the noise coming from other directions. Beamforming is a long-standing research topic in array signal processing with many applications, not limited to spatial audio processing [113, 114]. Beamformer output is often further enhanced by a microphone array post-filter [115, 116]. In this section, we first review the standard microphone array enhancement techniques, and then discuss the deep learning in a supportive way or an independent way.\n6.1. Beamforming and Post-Filtering\nBeamformers in general require a Direction-Of-Arrival (DOA) estimate for the target signal. In Delay-and-Sum (DS)\nbeamforming, which is one of the simplest approaches, the signals received by the different microphones are considered to have been delayed according to the target signal DOA. Fixed delay operators that compensate for the arrival delays are applied to the signals of the different microphones before summing them, so as to focus on the desired target direction; signal statistics are not considered by the DS beamformer (apart from a possible DOA estimation step). In contrast, adaptive beamforming techniques estimate statistics from the observed signal and determine the beamformer filter coefficients based on these statistics according to some criterion. In particular, the Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) or Capon beamformer works in the frequency domain and aims to minimise the energy at the beamformer output, while simultaneously keeping the gain in the direction of the target signal fixed at unity. The complex-valued signal model is Y(n) = S (n)d + A(n), where the vector Y(n) = (Y1(n), . . . , YM(n)) T contains the instantaneous noisy observations at the nth time instant on a given discrete frequency bin as registered by the M microphones, S (n) is the corresponding complex frequency bin of the unknown transmitted signal, the steering vector d is the desired signal spatial signature encoding its direction of arrival and A(n) is a (M × 1) vector containing the noise and interference contributions. Both the signal and the noise are assumed to have zero mean. In operation, the beamformer computes a linear combination of a complex weight vector w and the observation vector Y(n) as\nx(n) = wHY(n), (16)\nwhere (·)H denotes the Hermitian transpose. The general approach of Eq. (16) is known as filter-and-sum beamforming. In determining w using the MVDR criterion, the spatial covariance matrix representing the covariance of the noise plus interference will be needed. It is generally unknown but can be estimated as a sample covariance matrix of a suitable segment of N observations as RVV = (1/N) ∑ n Y(n)Y H(n) [117]. By then minimising wHRVVw with respect to w subject to the constraint wHd = 1, as mentioned above, the MVDR weight vector for the discrete frequency bin in question is given by [118]\nŵMVDR = R−1 VV d\ndHR−1 VV\nd . (17)\nIn multi-channel audio enhancement, the enhancement and noise reduction provided by the beamformer alone is typically not sufficient, as reducing noise and reverberation at low frequencies would require very large arrays [115]. Therefore, the output of a beamformer is often further enhanced by post-filtering relying on a single-channel Wiener filtering approach with statistics estimated from the multi-channel observations [119, 116, 120]. An optimal multi-channel Wiener filter formulation according to the MMSE criterion gives rise to the MVDR beamformer followed by a single-channel Wiener post-filter [115, 116, 120]. The Zelinski post-filter [119, 115] shows reasonable performance but is based on simplified assumptions including a perfectly incoherent noise field with zero\ncorrelation between the noise on different channels, an assumption that does not hold with low noise frequencies and closely spaced microphones. In order to address this issue, McCowan and Bourlard [116] proposed a generalisation of the Zelinski post-filter that assumes prior knowledge of the complex coherence of the noise field and demonstrated it with a diffuse noise model.\nThe MVDR beamformer is not robust against an inaccurately estimated steering vector d [121]. In contrast, Generalised EigenValue (GEV) beamforming requires no DOA estimate and is based on maximising the output signal-to-noise ratio [122]. The beamformer filter coefficients for a given frequency bin are found as the principal eigenvector of a generalised eigenvalue problem as required by [122]\nŵGEV = argmax w\nwHRS S w wHRVVw , (18)\nwhere RS S and RVV are the required estimates of the spatial covariance matrices of the target speech and noise/interference, respectively. When applied to broadband signals such as audio, this principle leads to considerable distortion of the speech due to independent SNR optimisation of each frequency bin. In [122], this is compensated by single-channel post-filtering in order to achieve a performance comparable to the MVDR beamformer.\n6.2. Neural-Network-Supported Beamformers\nTo calculate the spatial covariance matrices RS S and RVV of the GEV beamformer (see Eq. (18)), Heymann et al. [123] proposed in the third CHiME challenge (CHiME-3) to use LSTMRNNs to firstly estimate two Ideal Binary Masks (IBMs) for each microphone channel: one to indicate which T-F bins are presumably dominated by speech, and another to indicate which T-F bins are dominated by noise. This idea is similar to the one in [88], where a DNN was employed to predict the noise mask. To train the neural networks, the authors in [123] further used a multi-task learning framework with the input of noisy speech, and two corresponding IBM targets respectively from clean speech and noise in separate output layers. After the masks for each channel are obtained, they are then condensed to a single speech and a single noise mask by a median filter, which are sequentially used for estimating the spatial covariance matrices RS S and RVV and in turn the beamformer coefficients ŵGEV .\nThe aforementioned supervised neural network training process, however, requires both speech and noise counterparts of the noisy speech for each microphone channel. In this case, only the simulated data is possible to be employed for network training. To relax this requirement to some extent, a followup work was presented in [124], where only the clean speech was employed for mask estimation. Such a slight improvement enables it to utilise more realistic noisy and clean speech pair, which can be recorded simultaneously by close microphone (for clean speech) and distant microphone array (for noisy speech). The experimental results shown in [124] were competitive with\nprevious work. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the neuralnetwork-supportedGEV beamformer has been demonstrated in the recent 4th CHiME Challenge [112, 125].\nIn CHiME-3, Sivasankaran et al. [126] used a DS beamformer to obtain single-channel noisy spectra, and then used a DNN to map them into speech and noise spectra, which were then employed in constructing a multi-channelWiener filter according to [136], in order to replace the basic MVDR beamformer used in the challenge.\nWhile deep learning approaches have shown moderate success in CHiME-3 in estimating speech and noise statistics for multi-channel Wiener filtering and beamforming, the winning contribution was still able to rely on the baseline MVDR beamformer complemented with improved DOA estimate (the steering vector) based on T-F masks estimated using complex GMMs [109, 137]. Recent studies have, however, started to investigate the use of DNNs from the earliest stages of multichannel analysis, such as in DOA and steering vector estimation. DOA estimation using DNNs was studied in [127] and a follow-up study investigated the implementation of DS beamforming in an ASR system directly using a feedforward DNN that is used to predict the beamformer’s weight vector [128]. In both cases, the network was trained with generalised cross correlation from simulated multi-channel data from a given array geometry using all possible DOA angles. In the latter paper, the future work envisioned by the authors includes the use of spatial covariance matrices as input to the network, so that they could also use speech and noise statistics in predicting (adaptive) beamformer parameters.\nAs for post-filtering, very few recent papers appear to have\nused neural networks for this purpose. One such study evaluated a non-deep MLP network in predicting the post-filter parameters for a circular microphone array [129].\n6.3. End-to-End Multi-Channel Approaches\nRather than using neural networks to support traditional beamformers and post-filters for speech enhancement, end-toend multichannel ASR systems have recently attracted more attention with a straightforward target of WER decrease [130, 131, 132]. In [133], the individual features extracted from each microphone channel are concatenated as a long single feature vector and fed into DNN for AM. Whilst such a feature concatenation operation is simple, it was still found to be effective on the AMI dataset [133], and was further verified in [130].\nRecently, a more sophisticated approach was proposed in [131]. In this work, the authors utilised a joint network structure of single convolutional layer followed by several fully connected DNN layers. In more detail, the convolutional layer was operated on each channel independently with the magnitude spectrum as input, while max pooling was proceeded across channels to choose the channel with the largest respond in each node. This algorithm was found to perform better than the one by applying CNN after a DS beamformer output [131].\nMotivated by the success of this work as well as the research trend of end-to-end ASR systems, a study [132] extended the work of [131] on the raw signals and without the operation of cross-layer max pooling. The advantage of this extended work is that it can automatically exploit the spatial information found in the fine time structure, which greatly lies in the previously discarded FFT phase value, of the multichannel signals.\nA follow-up work was reported in [134], where the authors employed two convolutional layers, instead of one layer, at the front-end. The assumption is that the spatial and spectral filtering process can be separately processed by two convolutional layers. That is, the first layer is designed to be spatially selective, and second layer is implemented to decompose frequency that are shared across all spatial filters. By factoring the spatial and the spectral filters as separate layers in the network, the performance of the investigated system was notably improved in terms of WER [134]."

These technologies are mainly introduced in the viewpoint of single-channel and multi-channel, representative works of which are respectively summarised in Table 1 and Table 2. Both single and multi-channel techniques include the approaches that can be carried out in different ASR processing stages, i. e., the front-end, the back-end, or the jointed front- and back-end.\nThanks to the advance of deep learning, major achievements have been accomplished in the past four years, as shown in the literature. However, an obvious performance gap still remains between the enhanced system and the one evaluated in the clean environment. Thus, further efforts are still required for speech recognition to overcome the adverse effect of environmental noise [8, 6, 9].\nWe hope that this review could provide researchers and developers an opportunity to stand on the frontier of development in this field and to make greater breakthroughs."

To address this issue, traditional unsupervised signal processing methods seem to have touched the ceiling. However, data-driven based supervised approaches, particularly the ones designed with deep learning, have recently emerged as potential alternatives. In this light, we are going to comprehensively summarise the recently developed and most representative deep learning approaches to deal with the raised problem in this article, with the aim of providing guidelines for those who are going deeply into the field of environmentally robust speech recognition. To better introduce these approaches, we categorise them into singleand multi-channel techniques, each of which is specifically described at the front-end, the back-end, and the joint framework of speech recognition systems. In the meanwhile, we describe the pros and cons of these approaches as well as the relationships among them, which can probably benefit future research.",
