To reveal information about user preferences from Web usage data, Web Usage Mining (WUM) techniques are extensively being applied to the Web log data. Clustering techniques are widely used in WUM to capture similar interests and trends among users accessing a Web site. Clustering aims to divide a data set into groups or clusters where inter-cluster similarities are minimized while the intra cluster similarities are maximized.

INTRODUCTION\nWeb Usage Mining [1] is described as the automatic\ndiscovery and analysis of patterns in web logs and associated\ndata collected as a result of user interactions with Web\nresources on one or more Web sites. The goal of Web usage\nmining is to capture, model, and analyse the behavioural\npatterns and profiles of users interacting with a Web site. The\ndiscovered patterns are usually represented as collections of\nURLs that are frequently accessed by groups of users with\ncommon interests. Web usage mining has been used in a\nvariety of applications such as i) Web Personalization systems\n[2], ii) Adaptive Web Sites [3][4], iii) Business Intelligence\n[5], iv) System Improvement to understand the web traffic\nbehaviour which can be utilized to decide strategies for web\ncaching [6], load balancing and data distribution [7], iv) Fraud\ndetection: detection of unusual accesses to the secured data [8],\netc. Clustering techniques are widely used in WUM to capture similar interests and trends among users accessing a Web site. Clustering aims to divide a data set into groups or clusters where inter-cluster similarities are minimized while the intra cluster similarities are maximized. Details of various clustering techniques can be found in survey articles [9]-[11]. The ultimate goal of clustering is to assign data points to a finite system of k clusters. Union of these clusters is equal to a full dataset with the possible exception of outliers. Clustering groups the data objects based only on the information found in the data which describes the data objects and the relationships between them.\nSome of the main categories of the clustering methods are [12]: i) Partitioning methods, that create k partitions of a given data set, each representing a cluster. Typical partitioning methods include k-means, k-medoids etc. In k-means algorithm each cluster is represented by the mean value of the data points in the cluster called centroid of the cluster. On the other hand and in k-medoids algorithm, each cluster is represented by one of the data point located near the center of the cluster called medoid of the cluster. Leader clustering is also a partitioning based clustering techniques which generates the clusters based on an initially specified dissimilarity measure, ii) Hierarchical methods create a hierarchical decomposition of the given set of data objects. A hierarchical method can be classified as being either agglomerative or divisive, based on how the hierarchical decomposition is formed. iii) Density- based methods form the clusters based on the notion of density. They can discover the clusters of arbitrary shapes. These methods continue growing the given cluster as long as the number of objects or data points in the “neighborhood” exceeds some threshold. They can also filter out noise and outliers. DBSCAN is a typical densitybased method that grows clusters according to a density-based connectivity analysis. iv) Grid-based methods quantize the data\nJuly Issue Page 18 of 69 ISSN 2229 5208\nVol. 1, No. 3, 2011 object space into a finite number of cells that form a grid structure. All the clustering operations are performed on the grid structure. v) Model-based methods, that discover the best fit between data points given a mathematical model. Mathematical model is usually specified as a probability distribution.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section\nII presents a overview of web usage mining using clustering\ntechniques and the underlying concepts. Section III presents\neach of the k-Means, k-Medoids, Leader and DBSCAN\nclustering techniques in detail along with the underlying\nmathematical foundations. Section IV describes the\nexperimental results of each technique, followed by a\ncomparison of the results. A brief conclusion and future work\nare presented in Section V.\nII. WEB USAGE MINING USING CLUSTERING\nA number of clustering algorithms have been used in Web usage mining where the data items are user sessions consisting of sequence of page URLs accessed and interest scores on each URL page based on the characteristics of user behaviour such as time elapsed on a page or the bytes downloaded [2]. In this context, clustering can be used in two ways, either to cluster users or to cluster items. In user-based clustering, users are grouped together based on the similarity of their web page navigational patterns. In item based clustering, items are clustered based on the similarity of the interest scores for these items across all users. Mobasher et. al. [13], [14] have used both user-based clustering as well as item-based clustering in a personalization framework based on Web usage mining.\nA typical user-based clustering starts with the matrix representing the user sessions or user profiles and partitions this multi-dimensional space into k groups of profiles that are close to each other based on a measure of distance or similarity among the vectors (such as Euclidean or Manhattan distance). Clusters obtained in this way can represent user segments based on their common navigational behaviour or interest shown in various URL items. In order to determine similarity between a target user and a user segment represented by the user session clusters, the centroid vector corresponding to each cluster is computed which is the representation of that user segment. To make a recommendation for a target user u and target URL item i, a neighbourhood of user segments that have a interest scores for i and whose aggregate profile is most similar to u are selected. This neighbourhood represents the set of user segments of which the target user is most likely to be a member. Given that the aggregate profile of a user segment that contains the average interest scores for each item within the segment, a prediction can be made for item i using k-nearestneighbor approach [15].\nWe map the user sessions as vectors of URL references in a n-dimensional space. Let } , , , 21 nuuuU  be a set of n unique URLs appearing in the preprocessed log and let } , , , 21 msssS  be a set of m user sessions discovered by preprocessing the web log data, where each user session Ss i can be represented as } , , , 21 muuu wwws  . Each\niu w may be either a binary or non-binary value depending on whether it represents presence and absence of the URL in the\nsession or some other feature of the URL. If iu w represents presence of absence of the URL in the session, then each user session is represented as a bit vector where\n(1) otherwise 0;\n; if ;1      su w iui\nInstead of binary weights, feature weights can also be used to represent a user session. These feature weights may be based on frequency of occurrence of a URL reference within the user session, the time a user spends on a particular page or the number of bytes downloaded by the user from a page.\nIII. DATA CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES\nIn this section a detailed discussion of each clustering technique and its underlying mathematical model is presented."

Given a set of m data points  mixX i 1|  , where each data point is a n-dimensional vector, k-means clustering algorithm aims to partition the m data points into k clusters (k ≤ m) C = {c1, c2, …, ck} so as to minimize an objective function (or a cost function) J(V, X) of dissimilarity [17], which is the within-cluster sum of squares. In most cases the dissimilarity measure is chosen as the Euclidean distance. The objective function is an indicator of the distance of the n data points from their respective cluster centers. The objective function J, based on the Euclidean distance between a data point vector xi in cluster j and the corresponding cluster center vj, is defined in (2).\nj v i xvxd\ncxu\nc\nvxduvxJ\nvxduvxJVXJ\nji\njiij\ni\nm\ni\njiijjii\nk\nj\nm\ni\njiij\nk\nj\njii\nand between disatnce theis ),(\notherwise. 0 and if ,1\n, cluster ithin function w objective theis\n, ),(.),( , where\n(2) , ),(.),(),(\n2\n1\n2\n1 1\n2\n1\n\n\n  \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \nEuclidian distance between various data points and cluster centers can be calculated using (3).\nJuly Issue Page 19 of 69 ISSN 2229 5208\nj thj k\ni thi k\nj k\nn\nk\ni\nkji\nvkv\nxkx\nn\nvxvxd (3) ),(\nof dimensionsof value theis\nof dimensionsof value theis\npoint dataeach of dimensions ofnumber theis , where\n2\n1 2   \nThe k-means clustering first initializes the cluster centers randomly. Then each data point xi is assigned to some cluster vj which has the minimum distance with this data point. Once all the data points have been assigned to clusters, cluster centers are updated by taking the weighted average of all data points in that cluster. This recalculation of cluster centers results in better cluster center set. The process is continued until there is no change in cluster centers.\nThe partitioned clusters are defined by a mk binary membership matrix U, where the element uij is 1, if the ith data point xi belongs to the cluster j, and 0 otherwise.

The input to the algorithm is a set of m data points  mixX i 1|  , where each data point is a n-dimensional vector, it then determines the cluster centers vj and the membership matrix U iteratively as explained in Fig. 1.\nThe k-means algorithm provides locally optimal solutions\nwith respect to the sum of squared errors represented by the\nerror objective function. Since it is a fast iterative algorithm, it\nhas been applied to a variety of areas [18]-[20].\nThe attractiveness of the k-means lies in its simplicity and\nflexibility. However, it suffers from major shortcomings that\nhave been a cause for it not being implemented on large\ndatasets. The most important among these are i) k-Means\nscales poorly with respect to the time it takes for large number\nof points; ii) The algorithm might converge to a solution that\nis a local minimum of the objective function. The main\ndisadvantage of this algorithm lies in its sensitivity to initial\npositions of the cluster centroids [21].\nSince the performance of the k-Means algorithm depends\non the initial positions of the cluster centeroids, it is\nrecommended to execute the algorithm multiple times, each\nwith a different set of initial centroids."

It attempts to minimize the squared error, which is the distance between data points within a cluster and a point designated as the center of that cluster.

A medoid is a data point of a cluster, whose average dissimilarity to all the other data points in the cluster is minimal i.e. it is a most centrally located data point in the cluster [20],[22].\nGiven a set of m data points  mixX i 1|  , where each data point is a n-dimensional vector, k-mdoids clustering algorithm aims to partition the m data points into k clusters (k ≤ m) C = {c1, c2, …, ck} so as to minimize an objective function representing the sum of the dissimilarities between each of the data points and its corresponding cluster medoid.

It minimizes the sum of pair-wise dissimilarities instead of a sum of squared Euclidean distances as in case of k-means. Both methods require the user to specify k, the number of clusters."

Otherwise, the data point is labeled as noise. Later this point might be found in a sufficiently sized ε-neighborhood of a different data point and hence could become part of a cluster. If a data point is found to be part of a cluster, all the data points in its ε-neighborhood are also part of that cluster and hence added to the cluster.

      "text" : "In this paper we have presented our framework for web\nusage data clustering for users’ navigational sessions using k-\nMeans, k-Medoids, Leader and DBSCAN clustering\nalgorithms. We provided a detailed overview of these\ntechniques. We also described the mathematical model and\nalgorithm details related to the implementation of these\nclustering algorithms in order to discover the user sessions\nclusters. From the results presented in the previous section, we\nconclude the following points.\n K-means clustering produces fairly higher accuracy and lower clustering error as compared with k-medoids clustering algorithm.\n K-means algorithm may result in the formation of empty cluster while it is not the case with k-medoids algorithm.\n Our result shows that k-medoids algorithm gives reasonably better time performance than that of the kmeans algorithm. The reason behind this is we are using a large data set. The k-Medoids algorithm requires to compute the distance between every pair of data objects only once and uses this distance at every stage of iteration. On the other for an optimal solution k-Means algorithm performs multiple runs and computes the distance between every data object and it’s corresponding cluster center.\n Although Leader clustering algorithm does not require estimating the value of k at the beginning, it does require estimating the dissimilarity threshold ε.\n Number of clusters formed in Leader clustering is inversely proportional to the value of dissimilarity threshold ε.\n Leader clustering validity index (C index) improves as we increase the value of the dissimilarity threshold ε.\n DBSCAN algorithm can identify a data point as a noise or outlier.\nJuly Issue Page 26 of 69 ISSN 2229 5208\n DBSCAN validity index (C index) improves as we decrease the value of the neighborhood distance ε.\n If we choose the same value for dissimilarity threshold in Leader clustering and neighbor distance in DBSCAN (while keeping η constant), the time performance of Leader clustering much faster than that of DBSCAN.\nAnother direction of future work is related with the use of\nfuzzy c-Mean clustering technique to discover the user session\nclusters. The reason behind this is, although the several\nclustering algorithms described are suitable in handling the\ncrisp data which have clear cut boundaries, but in reality web\nusage data is semi-structured and contains the outliers and\nincomplete navigational data, due to a wide variety of reasons\ninherent to web browsing and logging. Therefore, Web Usage\nMining requires modelling of multiple overlapping sets in the\npresence of significant noise and outliers. Soft Computing\nbased techniques such as Fuzzy Clustering can be very useful\nfor mining such semi structured, noisy and incomplete data."

To reveal information about user preferences from Web usage data, Web Usage Mining (WUM) techniques are extensively being applied to the Web log data. Clustering techniques are widely used in WUM to capture similar interests and trends among users accessing a Web site. Clustering aims to divide a data set into groups or clusters where inter-cluster similarities are minimized while the intra cluster similarities are maximized. This paper reviews four of the popularly used clustering techniques: k-Means, k-Medoids, Leader and DBSCAN. These techniques are implemented and tested against the Web user navigational data. Performance and validity results of each technique are presented and compared. (Abstract) Keywords-component; web usage mining; k-means clustering; kmedoids clustering; leader clustering; DBSCAN",
