Due to this, recent researches for text classification mainly focus on character-level ConvNets. However, while the majority of these researches employ English corpus for the character-level text classification, few researches have been done using Chinese corpus. This research hopes to bridge this gap, exploring character-level ConvNets for Chinese corpus test classification. We have constructed a large-scale Chinese dataset, and the result shows that character-level ConvNets works better on Chinese character dataset than its corresponding pinyin format dataset, which is the general solution in previous researches. This is the first time that character-level ConvNets has been applied to Chinese character dataset for text classification problem."

      "text" : "Natural language processing (NLP) is the field in which through analysing data, the machine can extract information from contexts and represent the input information in a different way[6]. Generally speaking, NLP involves the following three tasks. Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS), such as text or image classification, to classify the data with different categories; Chunking (CHUNK), to label the segment of a given sentence by using syntactic and semantic relations; and Named Entity Recognition (NER), to tag named entities in text[5]. These tasks are varied, ranging from character-level to word-level and even to sentence-level. Nevertheless, they have the same purpose of finding out the hierarchical representations of the context[6].\nOne of the classic tasks for NLP is text classification, also known as document\nclassification[4]. This task aims to assign a pre-defined label to the document. Usually, two stages are involved in the process which are feature extraction and labels classification. In the first stage, some particular word combinations such as bigram, trigram, term frequency, and inverse document frequency of the phrase can be used as features.[5] Take BBC sports website for example, in its content, there are many specific Premier League team names, which can serve as corresponding features for the following classification. These features can then, in the second stage, help to maximise the accuracy of the task.\n1.2. Previous solutions 10"

      "text" : "A common approach to text classification is to use Bag of Words[8] , N-gram[2], and their term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)[33] as features, and traditional models such as SVM[14], Naive Bayes[25] as classifiers. However, recently, many researchers[41][5][16][6], using deep learning model, particularly the convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), have made significant progress in computer vision[9] and speech recognition[1]. ConvNets, originally invented by LeCun[20] for computer vision, refers to the model that uses convolution kernels to extract local features. Analyses have shown that ConvNets is effective for NLP tasks[40][30], and the convolution filter can be utilised in the feature extraction stages. Compared with the model listed above, ConvNets, when applied to text classification has shown rather competitive results[41][5][16][6]. The theory behind is quite similar to that of computer vision and speech recognition task. During the process in the convolutional layers, convolutional kernels would first treat the input text as a 1D-image. Then by using a fixed size convolution kernel, it can extract the most significant word combination such as the English Premier League in the sports topics. After hierarchical representations of the context are constructed, these features are then fed into a max-pooling layer for feature extraction, and the output result can represent the most important feature on this topic. In other words, the 1D-ConvNets can be regarded as a high-level N-grams feature classifier. With the help of ConvNets, we can classify the unlabelled document without using syntactic or semantic structures of a particular language. This is unusual in most of the large-scale dataset. Also, since the ConvNets method can handle the misspelling problem, it works well for user-generated data[41].\nRecent approach of using ConvNets on text classification mainly works at the\nword-level [5] [16]. In Kimś research, he found that pre-trained words embedding could gain a slight improvement on performances. Also, the multi-channel model allows the randomly initialised tokens to learn more accurate representations during the task. When different regularisers are applied, dropout layer proved to work well in the task, increasing by 4% in relative performance. Although this\n1.3. Research problems 11\napproach has achieved great success, some limitations remain. Firstly, when wordlevel ConvNets is applied in the classification task, the words sharing a common root, prefix or suffix tend to be treated as separate words. For instance, the words “surprise” and “surprisingly” are treated as two words without any relation in the model, which is counterintuitive. Secondly, the dimension of the input layer is related to the dictionary of the words. Due to the common root issue, the dimension up to 6,000 may lead to a sparse problem, which will significantly influence the performance. Thirdly, the words which are not presented in the training set will be marked as out-of-vocabulary words (OOV) and then simply replaced with a blank character. This problem frequently occurs in our test corpus, which may lead to serious consequences. Also, since some of the classification datasets are postings directly collected from the social network, these corpora are mixed with typos and abbreviations. This may diminish the classification accuracy of the task[37].\nIn the last few years, many researchers found that it is also likely to train a\nConvNets at the character-level[41][37][6]. The researchers still used one-hot or one-of-m encoding, and the vectors are transformed from the raw character to the dense vectors. Kim used a character sequence as an input in his language model[17], and Dhingra applied this idea to predict the hashtags[7]. The character-level ConvNets can avoid the problems as mentioned earlier from word-level. Firstly, since the units in the model are now the character, we can prevent the problem that some words sharing the same prefix or suffix do not show any relations. Secondly, the dictionary of character-level ConvNets are the size of the alphabet plus some symbols, and the dimension is around 70 in most of the character-level model. Due to this small dimension, the sparse problem can now be solved. Thirdly, since the choice of the alphabet is the same in both the training set and the test set, no more OOV appears in the test dataset. A significant improvement can be observed in which the model can better handle the typos with fewer parameters."

      "text" : "In this area, some research problems remain.\n1.3. Research problems 12\nFirst of all, after a thorough search of relevant literature, it seems that no re-\nsearchers have yet applied the character-level convolutional network to the Chinese character. Only some of the NLP tasks are based on pinyin encoding. Pinyin input is one of the most popular forms of text input in the Chinese language[3]. This method represents the Chinese characters in an alphabetic way according to its pronunciation (See Figure 1.1). Previous researchers such as Mathew used pinyin format dataset as input to detect spam in mobile text message[24] and Liu, similarly, using pinyin format dataset for feature selection[23], proved that pinyin format dataset could be utilised as an efficient method to solve the NLP problems. Unlike the English language, there is no gap between the characters in the Chinese language. However, the word segmentation still plays a significant role in understanding the sentence meaning.\nSecondly, how can the Chinese corpus gain benefit from the ConvNets when\nnot only the pinyin encoding but also the Chinese character lack language root? As we observed, the previous datasets mainly involve English corpus, language roots such as prefix and suffix are indicated to contribute to ConvNets ś ability to solve the typo problem in NLP.\n1.4. Contribution 13\nThirdly, the information compression among pinyin format, Chinese charac-\nters, and English may lead to different performances. For example, in the Chinese language, there are only 406 syllable combinations can be found in pinyin format representation among more than 6,000 commonly used Chinese characters, which means that some information is compressed during the transforming[3]. Another example is between English and Chinese, Twitter and Weibo, two popular online social networks, have a 140-word limit for each posting. However, since two different language systems, Roman alphabet and Chinese character alphabet, are mainly used respectively on Twitter and Weibo. Twitter can only provide titles and short web links while Weibo can afford more detailed information. Moreover, since more than 100 possibilities of word or character choice are available for the same pronunciation, it remains unclear whether the ConvNets can gain a representation from pinyin dataset in text classification task.\nThe tasks are yet to be solved due to the lack of large-scale Chinese charac-\nter dataset, and we believe that by concentrating on the following three parts, we can solve these tasks. Firstly, we will compare our proposed model with previous models on the pinyin format dataset. In this particular task, pinyin encoding on text classification task, we will find out the most important factors according to different experiments such as various depth and choice of alphabet. Secondly, the neural network model often requires a large-scale dataset so that the model can better extract features for classifying. To solve the problem of missing Chinese character dataset, an entirely new Chinese character dataset and its corresponding pinyin encoding dataset will be constructed. Finally, we will evaluate our models on these two datasets to find out the better solution."

However, since some of the words appear in each of these topics, this may influence the result. That is why the TF-IDF version Bag of Words add one extra feature, the inverse document frequency, to diminish this influences. This model is also based on the word-level, which means many words that share the same word stem but not the same count. In some way, by using the stemming technique, we can avoid this problem, yet not all the words containing same word stem have approximative meaning, which may lead to another problem. The result in Zhangś paper[41] shows that Bag of Words model and its TF-IDF version can achieve great performances in most of the tasks."

For instance, the model would calculate the appearance of word combination “Dow Jones Indexes” in all of the topics before applying the predefined class that ranks the most. TF-IDF version also adds the inverse document frequency to avoid the common words problem. This model is widely used in NLP area because of its trait, simplicity, and scalability.

The fully-connected layer with drop-out layer can then combine\n2.2. Neural Network models 18\nfeatures and send to the output layer. The word vectors in this model were initialised using the publicly available word2vec, which was trained on 100 billion words from Google News[26]. The comparison between several variants and traditional models applied on six datasets are reported in this paper, they are movie reviews with one sentence per review [28], TREC question dataset [21], a dataset for classifying the sentence whether subjective or objective[28], customer reviews of various products [12], opinion polarity detection subtask of the MPQA dataset [36], in particular, Stanford Sentiment Treebank [32]. The classes of those datasets are between two to six, and the dataset size is from 3,775 to 11,855. Kim selected the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ada-delta update rule[39] for his model.\nThe paper shows that the unsupervised pre-training of word vectors is an im-\nportant part of word-level ConvNets for NLP. Also, the temporal k-max pooling layer can capture and provide much more capacity because of the multiple filter widths and feature maps. Finally, dropout layer proved to be a good regulariser that adds performance. However, there are still some ways to explore. Only one convolutional layer was constructed in this ConvNets, while the trend in computer vision where significant improvements have been reported using much deeper networks, 19 layers[31], or even up to 152 layers[9]. Also, due to the small size of the dataset, the word-level ConvNets for NLP is yet to prove.\nZhang was the first one who proposed an entirely character-level convolutional\nnetworks for text classification[41].\nThere are two different ConvNets illustrated in this paper and the difference\nbetween them is the feature map size. Both of their depth are eight, consists of six convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers. The pooling layers follow the convolutional layers. Convolutional kernels of size seven are used in the first two layers, and the rest of the four layersḱernel size are three. There are also two dropout layers between the three fully-connected layer to regularise the loss. The input of this model is a sequence of encoding vectors, which is done by ‘applied an alphabet of size n for the input documents, and then quantise each character using one-hot encoding[41]’. However, Zhang did not use any pre-trained method\n2.2. Neural Network models 19\nsuch as word2vec[26] for the input word vectors in the model. By Contrast, Zhang used data augmentation techniques to enhance their performances by an English thesaurus. Also, they distinguish the upper-case and lower-case letters. However, the results show that worse result when such distinction is made. Moreover, Zhang constructed eight large-scale datasets to fill the vacancy in this NLP task. The eight large-scale datasets are Agś News, Sogou News corpus, DBPedia, Yelp Reviews, Yahoo Answers, and Amazon Reviews. Their size is from 120,000 to 3,600,000, and the classes are between two and fourteen. A comparison was made among traditional models such as SVM[14], Naive Bayes [25], Bag of Words, N-grams[2], and their TF-IDF version[33], also among deep learning models such as word-level ConvNets and long-short-term memory model(LSTM)[11]. The result shows that Bag-of-Means were the worst models among all 22 different modelś setting, and their testing error is the highest among all the dataset. N-gram model gained the lowest error rate in Yelp Review Polarity, and its TF-IDF version reached the best result in AGś News, Sogou News, DBPedia. Different settings of the ConvNets attained the lowest error rate in the rest of four datasets.\nThe paper shows that character-level ConvNets is an efficient and potential\nmethod due to their performance mentioned above. As we can observe in the result, when the dataset size comes large, the ConvNets models can do better than traditional models. Also, ConvNets work well for user-generated data, which means the ConvNets may be suitable in real-world scenarios. Then, for large-scale datasets, the distinction between the selection of upper letters and lower letters may lead to a worse result. However, the result is varied indicates that no single model works for all of the tasks or datasets.\nConneau[6] was the first one who implemented a very deep convolutional ar-\nchitecture which is up to 29 convolutional layers (9, 17, 29, 49 respectively) and applied to sentence classification.\nThere is a look-up table creating vectorial representations fed into the model,\nwith a convolutional layer behind. Then a stack of temporal “Convolutional blocks” which are a sequence of two convolutional layers, each one followed by a temporal\n2.2. Neural Network models 20\nbatch-normalization layer and a ReLU activation function. Different depths of the overall architecture are obtained by varying the number of convolutional blocks in between the pooling layers. The k-max pooling layer is followed to obtained the most important features of the stack of convolutional blocks[6]. Finally, the fullyconnected layers output the classification result. In this model, Conneau did not use ‘Thesaurus data augmentation’ or any other preprocessing, except lower-case the texts. The datasets in this paper are the same corpora of Zhang and Xiao [37], and the best results of them are the baseline in this article. The results show that the deep architecture works well when the depth increased, and the improvements are significant especially on large data sets compared with Zhangś convolutional models.\nMost of the previous application of shallow ConvNets to NLP tasks combin-\ning different filter size together. They indicate that the convolution layers can extract N-gram features over tokens. However, in this work, Conneau [6] created an architecture which used many layers of small convolutional kernel, which is size three. Compared with Zhangs ConvNets architecture, Conneau[6] found that better not to use dropout layer with the fully-connected layers, but only temporal batch normalization[13] after convolutional layers. At the same time, Conneau evaluates the impact of shortcut connections by increasing the number of convolution to 49 layers. As described in He[9], the gain in accuracy due to the increase of the depth is limited when using standard ConvNets. To overcome the degradation problem, He introduced ResNet model that allow gradients to flow more easily in the network. Moreover, as Conneau observed, they found improvement results when the network has 49 layers. However, they did not reach state-of-the-art results under this setting."

Neural Network models 21\nThe following model contains embedding layer, convolutional layers, recur-\nrent layers and the classification layers which are one, three, one, and one layers respectively. The convolutional network with up to five layers is used to extract hierarchical representations of features which serve as input for an LSTM. The word vectors were not pre-trained, while there is an embedding layer to transform the “one-hot vectors” into a sequence of dense vectors. The eight datasets in this paper are the same as Zhang, and Xiao, show that it is possible the use a much smaller model to achieve the same level performance when a recurrent layer is added on top of the convolution layers. There are five datasets that Xiao reached a better result than Zhang, which is AGs News, Sogou, DBPedia, Yelp Review full and Yahoo Answers. The rest of the result are closed. However, the parameters in Xiaos model are much less than Zhangś model.\nCompared with the character-level convolutional neural network model, this\nmodel achieved comparable performances for all the eight datasets. By reducing the number of convolutional layers and fully-connected layers, this model is with significantly fewer parameters, up to 50 times less, which means that they generalised better when the training size is limited. Also, this paper shows that the recurrent layer can capture long-term dependencies to solve the problem that convolutional layers usually require many layers due to the locality of the convolution and pooling. Moreover, the model achieves a better result when the number of classes increases compared with ConvNets models. It is mainly because the less pooling layer in hybrid models can preserve more detailed and complete information. Finally, there is an optimal level of local features to be fed into the recurrent layer, because Xiao noticed that the model accuracy does not always increase with the depth of convolutional layers[37].\nIn summary, all of the related work models are based on Roman alphabet cor-\npus. In this paper, we will describe our character-level convolutional neural network model applied to both Chinese character and its pinyin format and report the result on the latest large-scale dataset.\nChapter 3\nProposed solution\nIn this chapter, we present the model architecture in detail. There are four components in our model, which are data preprocessed, embedding layer, convolutional layers and fully-connected layers."

      "text" : "Our model begins with a data preprocessed stage. This stage is used for transforming the original characters to encoded characters. There are two types of the encoding method (See Figure 3.1) which are one-hot encoding and one of m encoding (Sparse coding). For the one-hot encoding, each word in the sentence is represented as a one-hot vector. The i-th symbol in this vector is set to one if it is the i-th element, while the rest of the symbol are remain zero[41]. However, we use the one of m encoding in our model. For the input corpus, we firstly construct an alphabet size equal to S, then used this dictionary to quantise each character, and the characters which are not in the alphabet will be replaced by a blank. Also, we set the maximum length of each sequence to L, and the exceeding part will be ignored, and the missing part will be replaced by zero, using zero-padding. Therefore, we can get a dense S sized vector with solid size L.\nAccording to previous researches, the quantisation order will be reversed. Usu-\nally, when we receive the information, the latest content will leave a deeper impression compared with the early one. According to this assumption, by reversing the encoding order, the most recent content can help the fully-connected layer to gain a\n3.1.

In previous researches[41][6], the alphabet size are 71 and 72 characters respectively. However, according to our experiment result, some trait of\n3.2. Embedding Layer 24\npinyin encodings such as no uppercase letter in the alphabet and not all 26 Roman letters included in the pinyin alphabet, therefore, we picked 42 characters to construct our dictionary. The smaller alphabet size efficiently decreases the parameters and improves the performances. For the Chinese character input, the dictionary is much larger than the pinyin input, reached to 6,653 characters, which are the words that appears in the dataset. The different size of dictionary between pinyin and Chinese character can help us understand how the dimension influences the result."

Usually, the embedding layer is used for decreasing the dimension of the input tensor. Also, the zero-padding help to transform the input tensor into a fixed size. However, as we have finished these two process in the previous stages, we can naturally treat the embedding layer as a look-up table. After the processed in embedding layer, the output shape can be treated as an image of size S * L, while the S is like the ‘RGB’ dimension in computer vision. By converting the input character into the one-dimension vector, the ConvNets can then extract the feature by the convolutional kernel.\n3.3. Convolutional Layer 25"

      "text" : "In convolutional layers, we apply up to three 1D-Convolution layers which have kernel size equal to three and feature map equal to 128. The operation of convolution is widely used in signal and image processing. For the 1D-Convolution we used, there are two signals which are text vector and kernel. After the process, the convolutional operation created a third signal which is the output. The text vector f is the output from the embedding layer, and the g is the kernel. For the text vector f, its length is n equal to 1,000 in our setting (for Chinese character is 300) while kernel g has length m which is 3. Here is the definition of the operation between f and g (The formula is also refer to Cornell University CS1114 courses, section6) :\n( f ∗g)(i) = m\n∑ j=1 g( j)∗ f (i− j+m/2)[41]\nWe can imagine the calculation is the kernel slides from the very beginning to\nthe end (including the zero-padding part), so that the 1D-convolution can extract features from the text input. Every kernel will be represented as a specific feature.\nAlso, each layer is initialised by henormal[10], and the border mode is same,\nwhich means the length remains 1,000 during this stages. In previous researches such as N-gram language model, researchers combine a different kind of N-gram such as bigram and trigram as the features, to extract multiple combinations of words from the dataset. The results show this setting can decrease the perplexity in the language model. However, latest work suppose that we can use deeper model and unify kernel size to extract features efficiently. Encouraged by Conneaus work[6], we only used the kernel size equal to three, so that during this period, the layers can automatically best combine these different “trigram” features in various layers.\nWe used the ReLU[27] as our nonlinear activation function, which is widely\nemployed in recent researches. Unlike the ‘sigmoid function, this activation function can better handle the gradient vanishing problem. Also, the threshold in ReLU can better simulate the brain mechanism of human. L2 regulation is being used in all these layers because it is quite efficient for solving the overfitting problem. The\n3.4. Fully-Connected Layer 26\noutput of the convolutional layer is a tensor of size 128 * 1000. They are the hierarchical representations of the input text. The convolutional layers can automatically extract N-gram features from the padded text, and these features can represent the hidden long short term relation in the text. In computer vision area, convolutional kernels are able to construct the pattern from the very beginning units, such as pixel, line, and shape. Meanwhile, the structure in NLP is similar, including character, word, and sentence. The similar properties in these two areas make the ConvNets interpretable.\nFinally, the max-pooling layer followed by the convolutional layer is necessary.\nThere are varies types of pooling layers such as max-pooling layer and average pooling layer[6]. The pooling layer can select the most important features from the output of 1D-convolution. Also, it can diminish the parameters to accelerate the training speed. We chose the temporal max-pooling with kernel size equal to the feature maps number, which means only the most important feature remains in this stage. At last, by using the flatten function, these features will be sent to the fully-connected layer with size 128 * 1 as a 1D tensor."

Unlike the current state of the art, Conneau did not use any dropout layers between the fully-connected layers. For a very deep architecture model, the batch normalization layer may be a better choice. However, because our model is not that deep, we still apply the dropout layer and set the dropout rate to ‘0.1’.\nChapter 4\nResults and Discussion\nIn this chapter, we will present our results and findings from the following two tasks. The first task is about the factors that may influence the ConvNets when the dataset is pinyin format. Compared with the previous models, we can find out the best setting for pinyin format.

In previous researches, researchers need to distinguish between upper-case and lower-case letters[41][37][6], which means the dimension of the dataset is at least fifty-two due to the Roman alphabet size. The worse result has been found when such distinction is made. Zhang explained that the differences between letter cases might affect the semantics, and that may lead to a regularisation problem[41]. However, in pinyin format encoding dataset, there is no distinction between the uppercase and lower-case letters. Furthermore, we only added four basic punctuations into the dictionary to lower the dimension. Figure 4.1 shows the dictionary:\nAs we observed from the original news article statistics, most of the content\nare no more than one thousand characters. Therefore, during the data preprocessed stage, all of the input text padded to a fixed size equal to 1000, and the following embedding layer convert them into a dense vector with dimension 16. Every convolutional layer applies to the same setting. The convolutional kernel size is three, and there is two zero-padding part located two sides. With this two zero-padding part, the length among the convolutional layers remains the same (length = 1000), which is useful for stacked layer structure. We initialised the convolutional layers"

In character-level ConvNets, the unit is character level, which means convolutional layers extract the character combination as a feature and ignore the segmentation among the words.

The researchers assume that the convolutional kernel can ignore the differences between two words shared same language roots such as suffix and prefix[41].

However, the results show that pinyin format dataset presents competitive result, and this leads to a question, how does it happen?\nHere are the reasons we have found in the analytics. Firstly, the word segmen-\ntation helps. Unlike the western language, there is no gap between each Chinese words, so during the transforming process, the pypinyin python library required another python library jieba to assist the word segmentation. That means the blank character between each word can provide a more accurate meaning that helps both human and computer to understand. Secondly, the words represent different meanings according to the context, sometimes even native speaker can misunderstand the actual meaning.

This model has been evaluated on brand new datasets which are consists of Chinese characters and its corresponding pinyin format, and the sizes are up to 600 thousand and 1.15 million respectively. The evaluation between Chinese characters and its corresponding pinyin format dataset shows that character-level ConvNets can works better with Chinese character dataset. We believe that the main reasons are due to the success of solving the word segmentation problem and the information storage capacity of Chinese corpus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the character-level ConvNets applied to Chinese corpus to solve the text classification task. Also, the validation on Zhangś dataset[41] show that proper dictionary and hyper-parameters play a major role in pinyin format text classification task.\nIn the future, we believe that the similar ideas can apply to the other NLP tasks\nsuch as reading comprehension, machine translation. With the help of characterlevel ConvNets, we may fulfil the full potential of Chinese language in NLP. Also, it will be interesting to apply a pre-trained method to character-level ConvNets when applied to Chinese character. Because the character in Chinese are meaningful as a word, while the character in English is meaningless. Finally, we hope that there will be more large-scaled Chinese dataset contains more classes in NLP area, in order to increase the difficulty of the task."

However, while the majority of these researches employ English corpus for the character-level text classification, few researches have been done using Chinese corpus. This research hopes to bridge this gap, exploring character-level ConvNets for Chinese corpus test classification. We have constructed a large-scale Chinese dataset, and the result shows that character-level ConvNets works better on Chinese character dataset than its corresponding pinyin format dataset, which is the general solution in previous researches.
