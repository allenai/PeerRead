      "text" : "DAGitty is a web-based software for analyzing causal diagrams. It contains some of the fastest algorithms available for this purpose.\nThis manual describes how causal diagrams can be created (Section 3) and manipulated (Section 4) using DAGitty. In Section 5, DAGitty’s capabilities to analyze causal diagrams are described. A brief introduction to causal diagrams is given in Section 2.\n1.1 Citing DAGitty\nDeveloping andmaintaining DAGitty requires a substantial amount of work; thus, if you publish research results obtained with the help of DAGitty, please consider giving us credit by citing our work. Depending on the context, you could cite the letter in Epidemiologywhere DAGitty has first been announced [16], or the research papers describing the specific algorithms used to identify biasing paths [18], adjustment sets [20], and instrumental variables [21].\n1.2 Running DAGitty online\nThere are two ways to run DAGitty: either from the internet or from your own computer. To run DAGitty online, visit the URL dagitty.net. DAGitty should run in every modern browser. Specifically, I expect it to work well on recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and Safari as well as on Internet Explorer (IE) version 9.0 or later, which all support scalable vector graphics (SVG). IE versions prior to 9.0 do not support SVG. These should be able to perform all diagnosis functions but cannot display the graphics as well as modern browsers can1. If you encounter any problems, please send me an e-mail so I can fix them (my contact information is at the end of this manual). Keep in mind that DAGitty is often used by hundreds of people per day from all\n1While this would be redeemable, I’d much rather invest my time in improving DAGitty for modern browsers than fixing it for old IE versions. If you absolutely need to run DAGitty on older IEs and encounter severe problems, please contact me.\nover the world – these people all benefit if the problem you found is fixed so please do consider investing the time to notify me if you encounter any bugs.\n1.3 Installing DAGitty on your own computer\nDAGitty can be “installed” on your computer for use without an internet connection. To do this, download the file dagitty.net/dagitty.zipwhich is a ZIP archive containing DAGitty’s source. Unpack this ZIP file anywhere in your file system. To run DAGitty, just open the file dags.html in the unpacked folder.\nSome features of DAGitty will not work in the offline version, because they are actually implemented on the web server. Currently, these features are:\n• Exporting model drawings as PDF, JPEG or PNG files.\n• Publishing models on-line.\n1.4 Migrating from earlier versions of DAGitty\nThe following two issues are important for users of older DAGitty versions. New users can skip this section.\n• It is now possible to have more than one exposure and/or outcome variable. This means that the old model code convention where the variable in the first line is the exposure and the variable in the second line is the outcome no longer works. Hence, if you open a model created with an earlier version in DAGitty 2.0, exposure and outcome will appear like normal variables. To fix this, simply set exposure and outcome again using the “e” and “o” keys and save the new model code.\n• Spaces in variables are now finally reliably supported. The way this works is that any variable name containing spaces or other special symbols is stored using “URL encoding” – e.g. “patient sex” will turn into “patient%20sex” (of course DAGitty will do this automatically for you). This may look strange but ensures that DAGitty models can be safely e-mailed, posted on websites, stored in word documents and so forth without having to worry about line breaks messing up variable names. If you have an older DAGitty model containing spaces in variable names, DAGitty 2.0 or higher should open thismodel correctly and perform the conversion itself. If it does not, consider sending me your model so I can investigate."

      "heading" : "2 A brief introduction to causal diagrams",
      "text" : "In this section, we will briefly review what causal diagrams are and how they can be applied in empirical sciences. For amore detailed account, we recommend the book Causality by Judea Pearl [8], or the chapter Causal Diagrams in the Epidemiology textbook of Rothman, Greenland, and Lash [10]. Also take a look at the web page dagitty.net/learn/, where I am collecting several tutorials (some of them interactive) on specific DAG-related topics.\nIn Epidemiology, causal diagrams are also frequently called DAGs.2 In a nutshell, a DAG is a graphic model that depicts a set of hypotheses about the causal process that generates a set of variables of interest. An arrow X → Y is drawn if there is a direct causal effect of X on Y. Intuitively, this means that the natural process determining Y is directly influenced by the status of X, and that altering X via external intervention would also alter Y. However, an arrow X→ Y only represents that part of the causal effect which is notmediated by any of the other variables in the diagram. If one is certain that X does not have a direct causal influence on Y, then the arrow\n2The term “DAG” is somewhat confusing to computer scientists and mathematicians, for whom a DAG is simply an abstract mathematical structure without specific semantics attached to it.\nis omitted. This has two important implications: (1) arrows should follow time order, or else the diagram contradicts the basic principle that causes must precede their effects; (2) the omission of an arrow is a stronger claim than the inclusion of an arrow – the presence of an arrow depicts merely the “causal null hypothesis” that X might have an effect on Y.\nMathematically, the semantics of an arrow X → Y can be defined as follows. Given a DAG G and a variable Y in G, let X1, . . . ,Xn be all variables in G that have direct arrows Xi → Y (also called the parents of Y). Then G claims that the causal process determining the value of Y can be modelled as a mathematical function Y := f (X1, . . . ,Xn, ǫY), where ǫY (the “causal residual”) is a random variable that is jointly independent of all Xi.\nFor example, the sentence “smoking causes lung cancer” could be translated into the following simple causal diagram:\nsmoking\nlung cancer\nWe would interpret this diagram as follows: (1) The variable “smoking” refers to a person’s smoking habit prior to a later assessment of cancer in that same person; (2) the natural process by which a person develops cancer might be influenced by the smoking habits of that person; (3) there exist no other variables that have a direct influence on both smoking habits and cancer. A slightly more complex version of this diagram might look as follows:\nsmoking\ntar deposit in lungs\nlung cancer\nThis diagram is about a person’s smoking habits at a time t1, the tar deposit in her lungs at a later time t2, and finally the development of lung cancer at an even later time t3. We claim that (1) the natural process which determines the amount of tar in the lungs is affected by smoking; (2) the natural process by which lung cancer develops is affected by the amount of tar in the lung; (3) the natural process by which lung cancer develops is not affected by the person’s smoking other than indirectly via the tar deposit; and finally (4) no variables having relevant direct influence on more than one variable of the diagram were omitted.\nIn an epidemiological context, we are often interested in the putative effect of a set of variables, called exposures, on another set of variables called outcomes. A key question in Epidemiology (and many other empirical sciences) is: how canwe infer the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome of interest from an observational study? Typically, a simple regression will not suffice due to the presence of confounding factors. If the assumptions encoded in a given the diagram hold, then we can infer from this diagram sets of variables for which to adjust in an observational study to minimize such confounding bias. For example, consider the following diagram:\nsmoking\ncarry matches cancer ?\nIf we were to perform an association study on the relationship between carrying matches in one’s pocket and developing lung cancer, we would probably find a correlation between these two variables. However, as the above diagram indicates, this correlation would not imply that carrying matches in your pocket causes lung cancer: Smokers are more likely to carry\nmatches in their pockets, and also more likely to develop lung cancer. This is an example of a confounded association between two variables, which is mediated via the biasing path (bold). In this example, let us assume with a leap of faith that the simplistic diagram above is accurate. Under this assumption, would we adjust for smoking, e.g. by averaging separate effect estimates for smokers and non-smokers, we would no longer find a correlation between carrying matches and lung cancer. In other words, adjustment for smoking would close the biasing path. Adjustment sets will be explained in more detail in Section 5.5.1.\nThe purpose of DAGitty is to aid study design through the identification of suitable, small sufficient adjustment sets in complex causal diagrams and, more generally, through the identification of causal and biasing paths as well as testable implications in a given diagram."

      "text" : "This section covers the three basic steps of working with DAGitty: (1) loading a diagram; (2) manipulating the graphical layout of the diagram; and (3) saving the diagram. First of all, any causal diagram consists of vertices (variables) and arrows (direct causal effects). You can either create the diagram directly using DAGitty’s graphical user interface (explained in the next section), or prepare a textual diagram description in a word processor and then import this description into DAGitty. In addition, DAGitty contains some pre-defined examples that you can use to become familiar with the program and with DAGs in general. To do so, just select one of the pre-defined examples from the “Examples”menu."

      "heading" : "3.1 DAGitty’s textual syntax for causal diagrams",
      "text" : "DAGitty’s textual syntax for causal diagrams is based on the one used by the DAG program by Sven Knüppel [6]. A diagram description (model code, somewhat clumsily calledmodel text data in older DAGitty versions) consists of two parts:\n1. A list of the variables in the diagram\n2. A list of arrows between the variables\nThe list of variables consists of one variable per line. After each variable name follows a character that indicates the status of the variable, which can be one of “1” (normal variable), “A” (adjusted for), “U” (latent/unobserved), “E” (exposure), or “O” (outcome). If you prepare your diagram description in a word processor rather than constructing the diagram in DAGitty itself, you may encounter problems when you use spaces or other special symbols in variable names (e.g. instead of “patient sex” you should write “patient sex”). This restriction does not apply when you construct the diagram using DAGitty’s graphical user interface.\nThe list of arrows consists of several lines each starting with a start variable name, followed by one or more other target variables that the start variable is connected to. Figure 1 contains a worked example of a textual model description. When you modify a diagram within DAGitty, the vertex labels will be augmented by additional information to help DAGitty remember the layout of the vertices and for other purposes (see rightmost column in Figure 1).\n3.2 Loading a textually defined diagram into DAGitty\nTo load a textually defined diagram into DAGitty, simply copy&paste the variable list, followed by a blank line, followed by the list of arrows into the “Model code” text box. Then click on “Update DAG”. DAGittywill now generate a preliminary graphical layout for your diagramon the canvas, which may not yet look the way you intended, but can be freely modified."

      "text" : "To layout the vertices and arrows of your diagrammore clearly thanDAGitty did, simply drag the vertices with your mouse on the canvas. You may notice that DAGitty modifies the information in the “Model code” field on the fly, and augments it with additional position information for each vertex. In general, all changes you make to your diagram within DAGitty are immediately reflected in the model code."

Select the corresponding function from the “Model” menu. If you want to edit the graphical layout of the diagram or annotate it, it is recommended to export the diagram as an SVG file and open that in a vector graphics program such as Inkscape."

      "text" : "Part of the appeal of using DAGs is that the assumptions underlying one’s research are made explicit, and the conclusions drawn from the data can be later re-checked if some of the assumptions are found to not hold. Of course, this requires to make the DAG available together with the data and interpretation. I have however seen many articles where people report having used DAGs but do not actually show them. If researchers, reviewers or editors deem it inappropriate to include the DAG (or its model code) in the manuscript itself, here’s another option: Store the DAG on the DAGitty website and get a short URL under which this DAG will be accessible. Then include this URL in the manuscript, or its supporting information. For example, one of the DAGitty examples is stored at the URL dagitty.net/mvcFQ.\nHere’s how it works: Draw your DAG to full satisfaction, then choose “Publish on dagitty.net” from the “Model” menu. You have two options how to publish your DAG: anonymously, or linking it to an e-mail address. If you store the DAG anonymously, you will later on not be able to edit it or delete it from the server.\nAfter choosing “Publish on dagitty.net” from the “Model”menu, a small formwill appearwhere you can enter some metadata on the DAG, and provide your e-mail address if you so wish. Upon\n3This is most easily done by clicking in the text field, pressing “CTRL + A” to select the entire content of the text field, then pressing “CTRL + C” to copy the content. You can then paste the content in another program using “CTRL + V”.\nclicking “Publish”, theDAGwill be sent to the dagitty.net server, and youwill receive aURLunder which the DAG is now available. If you provided your e-mail address, you will also receive a message requesting you to confirm your ownership of the DAG. This is simply done by clicking on a confirmation link. Only then will the DAG be linked to your e-mail address, and you will receive a password to use when deleting or modifying the published DAG.\nIf you did link your DAG to your e-mail address, you can delete it by choosing “Delete on dagitty.net” from the “Model” menu, which will prompt you to enter the DAG’s URL and the password. If the URL and password match, the DAGwill be deleted. Similarly, you can update a stored DAG using the “Load from dagitty.net” function from the “Model”menu, modifying it, and saving it again. You can view published DAGs (if you know their URL) by just putting the URL into your address bar of course, but you can also do so using the “Load from dagitty.net” function.\nPlease note that all DAGs stored on dagitty.net are meant to be public information. Do not store any data that you consider private or in any way secret. Once stored on dagitty.net, every person in the world who knows your DAG’s URL can view it (but not your e-mail address if you provided one). Also note that there is no guarantee that dagitty.net will keep running forever. Storing your DAGs is done at your own risk. Still, youmay find this feature useful, for instance to e-mail your DAGs to colleagues or to include links to DAGs in papers under review. For archival purposes, it may be more appropriate to include the DAG or the model code in the paper itself or its supporting information."

That is, they have the form e→ x1 → . . .→ xk → o.\n• Biasing paths are all other paths from exposure to outcome. For example, such paths can have the form e← x1 → . . .→ xk → o.\nWith respect to a set Z of conditioning variables (that can also be empty if we are not conditioning on anything), paths can be either open or closed (also called d-separated [8]). A path is closed by Z if one or both of the following holds:\n• The path p contains a chain x→ m→ y or a fork x← m→ y such that m is in Z.\n• The path p contains a collider x→ c← y such that c is not in Z and furthermore, Z does not contain any successor of c in the graph.\nOtherwise, the path is open.

That is, in a DAG with three variables X, M, and Y, an arrow X → Y means that there is a causal effect of X on Y that is not mediated through the variable M. Often when building DAGs, people tend to forget this aspect and think only about whether any kind of causal effect exists, without paying attention to how it is mediated. This may result in DAGs with too many arrows.\nTo aid users with this, George Ellison (Leeds University) suggested to implement a function that identifies arrows for which also a corresponding indirect pathway exists. After drawing an initial DAG, onemight reconsider these arrows and judgewhether they are really necessary given the indirect pathways already present in the diagram.\nFor example, suppose after thinking about the pairwise causal relationships between our variables X,M, Y we came up with this DAG:\nX M Y\nFor the arrows drawn in bold, there is no corresponding indirect path – removing one of these arrows from the diagram means that there will no longer be any causal effect between the corresponding variables. These arrows are called atomic direct effects in DAGitty, and they can be highlighted – like in the above DAG – by ticking the checkbox with that name. On the other hand, for the thin arrow X → Y, there is also the indirect pathway X → M → Y. One may therefore reconsider whether the arrow X→ Y is truly necessary – perhaps the causal effect from X to Y is entirely mediated through M."

In other words, variables not connected by a line in the correlation graphmust be statistically independent. These pairwise independencies are also listed in the “Testable implications” field on the right-hand side of the screen, and so the correlation graph could be seen as encoding a subset of those implications.\nAlthough this is not implemented in DAGitty yet, it is also possible to take a given correlation graph (which can be obtained e.g. by thresholding a covariance matrix) and list all the DAGs that are “compatible” with it in the sense that they entail exactly the given correlation graph [17]."

    }, {
      "heading" : "5.5.1 Adjustment sets",
      "text" : "Finding sufficient adjustment sets is one main purpose of DAGitty. In a nutshell, a sufficient adjustment set Z is a set of covariates such that adjustment, stratification, or selection (e.g. by restriction or matching) will minimize bias when estimating the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome (assuming that the causal assumptions encoded in the diagram hold). You can read more about controlling bias and confounding in Pearl’s textbook, chapter 3.3 and epilogue [8]. Moreover, Shrier and Platt [13] give a nice step-by-step tutorial on how to test if a set of covariates is a sufficient adjustment set.\nTo identify adjustment sets, the diagram must contain at least one exposure and at least one outcome.\nTotal and direct effects. One can understand adjustment sets graphically by viewing an adjustment set as a set Z that closes all all biasing paths while keeping desired causal paths open (see previous section). DAGitty considers two kinds of adjustment sets:\n• Adjustment sets for the total effect are sets that close all biasing paths and leave all causal paths open. In the literature, if the effect is not mentioned (e.g. [13, 6]), then usually this kind of adjustment set is meant.\n• Adjustment sets for the direct effect are sets that close all biasing paths and all causal paths, and leave only the direct arrow from exposure X to outcome Y (i.e., the path X → Y, if it exists) open.\nIn a diagram where the only causal path between exposure and outcome is the path X → Y, the total effect and the direct effect are equal. This is true e.g. for the diagram in Figure 1. An example diagram where the direct and total effects are not equal is shown in Figure 2.\nAs proved by Lauritzen et al. [7] (see also Tian et al. [19]), it suffices to restrict our attention to the part of the model that consists of exposure, outcome, and their ancestors for identifying sufficient adjustment sets. This is indicated by DAGitty by coloring irrelevant nodes in gray. The relevant variables are colored according to which node they are ancestors of (exposure, outcome, or both) – see the legend on the left-hand side of the screen. The highlighting may be turned on and off by toggling the “highlight ancestors” checkbox.\nMinimal sufficient adjustment sets. A minimal sufficient adjustment set is a sufficient adjustment set of which no proper subset is itself sufficient. For example, consider again the causal diagram in Figure 1. The following three sets are sufficient adjustment sets for the total and direct effects, which are equal in this case:\n{A,B,Z}\n{A,Z}\n{B,Z}\nEach of these sets is sufficient because it closes all biasing paths and leaves the causal path open. The sets {A,Z} and {B,Z} are minimal sufficient adjustment sets while the set {A,B,Z} is sufficient, but not minimal. In contrast, the set {Z} is not sufficient, since this would open the path E← A→ Z← B← D: Because both E andD depend on Z, adjusting for Zwill induce additional correlation between E and D.\nFinding minimal sufficient adjustment sets. To find minimal sufficient adjustment sets, select the option “Adjustment (total effect)” or “Adjustment (direct effect)” in the “Causal effect identification” field. DAGitty will then calculate all minimal sufficient adjustment sets and display them in that field. Any changes made to the diagramwill be instantly reflected in the list of adjustment sets.\nForcing adjustment for specific covariates. You can also tell DAGitty that you wish a specific covariate to be included into every adjustment set. To do this, move the mouse over the vertex of that covariate and press the a key. DAGitty will then update the list of minimal sufficient adjustment sets accordingly – every set displayed is now minimal in the sense that removing any variable except those you specified will render that set insufficient. However, when you adjust for an intermediate or another descendant of the exposure, DAGitty will tell you that it is no longer possible to find a valid adjustment set.\nAvoiding adjustment for unobserved covariates. You can tell DAGitty that a certain variable is unobserved (e.g. not measured at present, or not measurable because it is a latent variable) by moving the mouse over that covariate and pressing the u key. DAGitty will only calculate adjustment sets that do not contain unobserved variables. However, if too many or some important variables are unobserved, then it may be impossible to close all biasing paths."

      "heading" : "5.5.2 Instrumental variables",
      "text" : "Sometimes it is not possible to estimate a causal effect by simple covariate adjustment. For example, this is the case whenever there is an unobserved confounder that directly effects the exposure and outcome variables. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to estimate the causal effect at all. Instrumental variable regression is a technique that is often used in situations with unobserved confounders. Note that this technique depends on linearity assumptions. For further information on instrumental variables, please refer to the literature [2, 5]. DAGitty can find instrumental variables in DAGs, as explained below.\nThe validity of an instrumental variable I depends on two causal conditions: exogeneity, and exclusion restriction. These two conditions can be expressed in the language of DAGs and paths as follows: (1) theremust be an open path between I and the exposureX; and (2) all paths between I and the outcome Y must be closed by {X}. A variable that fulfills these two conditions is called an instrumental variable or simply an instrument.\nInstrumental variables can also be generalized such that the two conditions are required to hold conditional on a set of covariates Z [4]. The two conditions then read as follows: (1) there must be a path between I and X that is opened by Z; and (2) all paths between I and Y must be closed by Z ∪ {X}. A variable that fulfills these two conditions is called a conditional instrument.\nDAGitty will find both “classic” and conditional instruments when the option “Instrumental Variable” is selected under the “Causal effect identification” field. Note that DAGitty will not always list all possible instruments; instead, it will restrict itself to a certain well-defined subset that we call “ancestral instruments”. However, whenever any instrument or conditional instrument exists at all, thenDAGitty is guaranteed to find one. Note also that if there are several instruments available, then it is best to choose the one that is most strongly correlated with X (conditional on Z in the case of a conditional instrument).\nFor details regarding ancestral instruments and how DAGitty computes them, please refer to the research paper where we describe these methods [21]."

      "heading" : "5.6 Testable implications",
      "text" : "Any implications that are obtained from a causal diagram, such as possible adjustment sets or instrumental variables, are of course dependent on the assumptions encoded in the diagram. To some extent, these assumptions can be tested via the (conditional) independences implied by the diagram: If two variablesX andY are d-separatedby a setZ, thenX andY should be conditionally independent given Z. The converse is not true: Two variables X and Y can be independent given a set Z even though they are not d-separated in the diagram. Furthermore, two variables can also be d-separated by the empty set Z = ∅. In that case, the diagram implies that X and Y are unconditionally independent.\nDAGitty displays all minimal testable implications in the “Testable implications” text field. Only such implications will be displayed that are in fact testable, i.e., that do not involve any unobserved variables. Note that the set of testable implications displayed by DAGitty does not constitute a “basis set” [8]. Future versions will allow choosing between different basis sets.\nIn general, the less arrows a diagram contains, the more testable predictions it implies. For this reason, “simpler” models with fewer arrows are in general easier to falsify (Occam’s razor)."

Functions include identification of minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, diagnosis of insufficient or invalid adjustment via the identification of biasing paths, identification of instrumental variables, and derivationof testable implications. DAGitty is provided in thehope that it is useful for researchers and students inEpidemiology, Sociology, Psychology, and other empirical disciplines. The software should run in any modern web browser that supports JavaScript, HTML, and SVG. This is the user manual for DAGitty version 2.3. The manual is updated with every release of a new stable version. DAGitty is available at dagitty.net.",
