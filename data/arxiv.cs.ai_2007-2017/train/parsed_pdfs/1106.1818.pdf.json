      "text" : "Re ent advan es in the study of voting lassi ation algorithms have brought empiri al and theoreti al results learly showing the dis rimination power of ensemble lassi ers. It has been previously argued that the sear h of this lassi ation power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable lassi ers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep\nlassi ation strength is being raised in a growing number of ma hine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoreti ally and empiri ally the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simpli ity-a ura y tradeo for voting lassi ers. Then we provide an eÆ ient \\top-down and prune\" indu tion heuristi , WIDC, mainly derived from re ent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the rst attempt to build a voting\nlassi er as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one whi h was previously highly su essful for de ision tree indu tion), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for su h lassi ers with boosting-like approa hes). While it uses a well-known indu tion s heme previously su essful in other lasses of on ept representations, thus making it easy to implement and ompare, WIDC also relies on re ent or new results we give about parti ular ases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of whi h readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produ e small, a urate, and interpretable de ision\nommittees."

      "text" : "Re ent advan es in the study of voting lassi ation algorithms have brought empiri al and theoreti al results learly showing the dis rimination power of ensemble lassi ers (Bauer & Kohavi, 1999; Breiman, 1996; Dietteri h, 2000; Opitz & Ma lin, 1999; S hapire & Singer, 1998). These methods basi ally rely on voting the de ision of individual lassi ers inside an ensemble. It is widely a epted, and formally proven in ertain ases (S hapire, Freund, Bartlett, & Lee, 1998; S hapire & Singer, 1998), that their power a tually relies on the ability to build potentially very large lassi ers. It has even been observed experimentally that su h an ensemble an sometimes be as large as (or larger than) the data used to build the ensemble (Margineantu & Dietteri h, 1997) ! Then, a simple question arises, namely what is the interest a ustomer an have in using su h a lassi er, instead of simple\n2002 AI A ess Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nlookups in the data, and using algorithms su h as nearest neighbor lassi ers (Margineantu & Dietteri h, 1997) ?\nAfter some of the most remarkable re ent studies in voting lassi ation algorithms, some authors have pointed out the interest to bring this lassi ation power to data mining, and more pre isely to make interpretability a lear issue in voting lassi ation algorithms (Bauer & Kohavi, 1999; Ridgeway, Madigan, Ri hardson, & O'Kane, 1998). Some authors go even further, and argue that the importan e of interpretability has been marginalized in the design of these algorithms, and put behind the need to devise lassi ers with strong\nlassi ation power (Ridgeway et al., 1998). But interpretability also governs the quality of a model by providing answers to how it is working, and, most importantly, why. A ording to Bauer & Kohavi (1999), striving for omprehensibility in voting models is one of the prin ipal problems requiring future investigations. They also remark that \\voting te hniques usually result in in omprehensible lassi ers that annot easily be shown to users\".\nComprehensibility is, on the other hand, a hard mining issue (Buja & Lee, 2001) : it depends on parameters su h as the type of lassi ers used, the algorithm indu ing the\nlassi ers, the user mining the outputs, et . . Though the quanti ation of interpretability is still opened in the general ase (Buja & Lee, 2001), there are some lues oming from theory and pra ti e of ma hine learning/data mining indi ating some potentially interesting requirements and ompromises to devise an eÆ ient learning/mining algorithm.\nA rst requirement for the algorithm is obviously its generalization abilities: without lassi ation strength, it is pointless to sear h for interesting models of the data. A se ond requirement, more related to mining, is the size of the lassi ers (No k & Gas uel, 1995; No k & Jappy, 1998). If a urate, a lassi er with restri ted size an lead to faster and deeper understanding. This is obviously not an absolute rule, rather an approximate proxy for interpretability : pathologi ases exist in whi h, for example, a large and unbalan ed tree an be very simple to understand (Buja & Lee, 2001). Note that in this example, the authors explain that the tree is simple be ause all its nodes an be des ribed using few\nlauses. Therefore, simpli ity is also asso iated to a short des ription, but using a parti ular lass of on ept representation.\nA third parameter in uen ing omprehensibility is the nature of the algorithm's output. Inside the broad s ope of symboli lassi ers, some lasses of on ept representations appear to o er a greater omfort for interpretation. De ision trees belong to this set (Breiman, Freidman, Olshen, & Stone, 1984), though they also raise some interpretability problems : Kohavi & Sommer eld (1998) quote that\n\\the lients [business users℄ found some interesting patterns in the de ision trees, but they did not feel the stru ture was natural for them. They were looking for those two or three attributes and values (e.g. a ombination of geographi and industries) where something \\interesting\" was happening. In addition, they felt it was too limiting that the nodes in a de ision tree represent rules that all start with the same attributes.\"\nAlthough not limiting from a lassi ation viewpoint, the ordering of nodes prior to lassi ation an therefore make it un omfortable to mine a de ision tree. Noti e that this problem might hold for any lass of on ept representation integrating an ordering prior to lassi ation: de ision lists (Rivest, 1987), alternating de ision trees (Freund & Mason,\n1999), bran hing programs (Mansour & M Allester, 2000), et . . There exists, however, a type of lassi ers on whi h related papers appear to be generally unanimous on their mining abilities : disjun tive normal form formulas (DNFs, and their numerous extensions), that is, disjun tions of onjun tions. Interestingly enough, this is the lass whi h motivated early works (and a great amount of works afterwards) on the well-known PAC theory of learning (Valiant, 1984, 1985), partly be ause of the tenden y humans seem to have to represent knowledge using similarly shaped rules (Valiant, 1985). This lass is also the dual of the one impli itly used by Buja & Lee (2001) to ast their size measure for de ision trees (to state whether the on ept represented is simple or not).\nIt is our aim in this paper to propose theoreti al results and approximation algorithms related to the indu tion of very parti ular voting lassi ers, drawing their roots on simple rule sets (like DNF), with the obje tive to keep a tradeo between simpli ity and a ura y. Our aim is also to prove that, in the numerous indu tion algorithms already proposed throughout the ma hine learning and data mining ommunities, some of them, previously used in de ision trees and de ision lists indu tion, an be easily adapted to ope with this obje tive, thereby leading to easy-to-implement (and ompare) algorithms. The next se tion presents a synthesis of our ontribution, whi h is detailed in the rest of the paper."

      "text" : "This paper is prin ipally on erned with the theoreti al and experimental study of a set of voting lassi ers whi h we think is likely to provide an a urate answer to the simpli itya ura y tradeo : de ision ommittees (DC) (No k & Gas uel, 1995). DC is informally the Boolean multi lass extension of polynomial dis riminant fun tions. A de ision ommittee\nontains rules, ea h of these being a pair (monomial, ve tor). Ea h monomial is a ondition that, when red, returns its ve tor. After ea h monomial has been tested, the sum of the returned ve tors is used to take the de ision. This additive fashion for ombining rules is absent from lassi al Boolean lassi ers su h as De ision Trees (DT) or De ision Lists (DL). Furthermore, unlike these two latter lasses, the lassi er ontains absolutely no ordering, neither on variables (unlike DT), nor on monomials (unlike DL). When suÆ iently small DCs are built and adequate restri tions are taken, a new dimension in interpreting the lassi er is obtained, whi h does not exist for DT or DL. Namely, any example an satisfy more than one rule, and a DC an therefore be interpreted by means of various rule subsets (in a naive onversion of a DT or a DL into rule sets, any example satis es exa tly one rule). De ision ommittees resemble or generalize other rule sets (Cohen & Singer, 1999). In this paper, the authors onsider DNF-shaped formulas, in whi h the output of a monomial is not a lass ( alled \\positive\"), but a (non-negative) on den e in the\nlassi ation as positive. A default lass predi ts the other lass, alled \\negative\" (this is a setting with two lasses). Computing the lass of an observation boils down to summing the\non den es of the rules it satis es, and then de iding the positive lass if the sum is greater than zero, and the negative lass otherwise. De ision ommittees are a generalization of these formulas, in whi h we remove the setting's onstraint (two lasses) and authorize the membership predi tion to arbitrary lasses, thereby leading to a true voting lassi er. This voting fashion is a feature that de ision ommittees share with de ision tables (Kohavi & Sommer eld, 1998). However, de ision tables lassi ers are based on majority voting of the\nexamples (and not of rules), over a restri ted \\window\" of the des ription variables. They ne essitate the storing of many examples, and the interpretations of the data an only be made through this window, a ording to this potentially large set of examples. De ision\nommittees rather represent an eÆ ient way to en ode a voting method into a small number of rules, and the way a lass is given an be brought ba k to early works in ma hine learning (Clark & Boswell, 1991). More formal details are provided in the next se tion.\nAmong our theoreti al results, that are presented in the following se tion, we provide formal proofs that the simpli ity-a ura y tradeo is also hard to a hieve for DC, as well as for the onstru tion of omplex votes involving DT. This last result shows that, while mixing C4.5 with boosting provides one of the most powerful lassi ation algorithms (Friedman, Hastie, & Tibshirani, 2000), pruning boosting is essentially heuristi (Margineantu & Dietteri h, 1997).\nThe algorithm we propose for the indu tion of DC, WIDC (for Weak Indu tion of De ision Committees), has the following key features. It uses re ent results on partition boosting, ranking loss boosting (S hapire & Singer, 1998) and some about pruning Boolean formulas (Kearns & Mansour, 1998). WIDC follows a s heme lose to C4.5's for de ision trees (Quinlan, 1994), or ICDL's for de ision lists (No k & Jappy, 1998) ; as su h, it di ers from previous studies in voting lassi ers (boosting, bagging (Breiman, 1996)) by features su h as the fa t that no modi ation is made on the example's distribution during indu tion. It is also one if its di eren es with the SLIPPER rule indu tion approa h (Cohen & Singer, 1999).\nOn multi lass and multilabel problems,WIDC proposes a very fast and simple solution to ranking loss boosting, optimal in fairly general ases, and asymptoti ally optimal in most of the remaining ones. The general problem of ranking loss boosting was previously onje - tured NP -Hard (S hapire & Singer, 1998). Though our ranking loss boosting algorithm is not always optimal, we also show that the general ranking loss boosting problem related to S hapire & Singer (1998) is a tually not NP -Hard, and an be solved in polynomial time, though it seems to require the use of omplex and time-expensive algorithms, related to the minimization of (symmetri ) submodular fun tions. This also partially justi es the use of our simple and fast approximation algorithm.\nThe last se tion of this paper presents experimental results obtained with WIDC on thirty-one domains, most of whi h are readily available and an be found on the UCI repository of ma hine learning database (Blake, Keogh, & Merz, 1998).\nIn order to keep the paper self- ontained and as on ise and readable as possible, we have hosen to put an appendix at the end of the paper ontaining all proofs of our results."

Our results imply that regardless of the restri tion over the values of the ve tors (as long as they are elements of a set with ardinality 2), and already for two- lasses problems, minimizing the size of a de ision ommittee for both size de nitions is as hard as solving well-known NP -Hard problems.

Overview of WIDC\nAn algorithm, IDC, was previously proposed (No k & Gas uel, 1995) for building de ision\nommittees. It pro eeds in two stages. The rst stage builds a potentially large subset\nof di erent rules, ea h of whi h is a tually a DC\nf 1;0;+1g\nwith only one rule.

At the end of this pro edure, the\nuser obtains a set of DCs, and the most a urate one is hosen and returned. Experimental results display the ability of IDC to build small DCs. In that paper, we provide an algorithm for learning de ision ommittees whi h has a di erent stru ture sin e it builds only one DC. More pre isely, WIDC is a three stage algorithm. It rst builds a set of rules derived from results on boosting de ision trees (S hapire & Singer, 1998). It then al ulates the ve tors using a s heme derived from Ranking loss boosting (S hapire & Singer, 1998).

Suppose that we en ode the de ision tree in the form of a subset of monomials, by taking for ea h leaf the logi al-^ of all attributes from the root to the leaf. Measuring Z over the tree's leaves is equivalent to measure Z over the partition realized by the set of monomials. However, the monomials are disjoint from ea h other (ea h example satis es exa tly one monomial). Due to this property, only t subsets an be realized with t monomials, or equivalently with a tree having t leaves.\nSuppose that we generalize this observation by removing the disjointness ondition over\nthe monomials. Then a number of subsets of order O(2\nt\n) is now possible with only t\nmonomials, and it appears that the number of realized partitions an be exponentially larger using de ision ommittees than de ision trees. However, the expe ted running time is not bigger when using de ision ommittees, sin e the number of partitions is in fa t bounded by the number of examples, jLSj. Thus, we may expe t some redu tion in the size of the formula we build when using de ision ommittee, whi h is of interest to interpret the\nlassi er obtained.\nAppli ation of this prin iple in WIDC is straightforward: a large de ision ommittee is built by growing iteratively, in a top-down fashion, a urrent monomial. In this monomial, the literal added at the urrent step is the one whi h minimizes the urrent Z riterion, over all possible addition of literals, and given that the new monomial does not exist already in the urrent de ision ommittee (in order to prevent multiple additions of a single monomial). The Z riterion is omputed using the partition indu ed over LS by the urrent set of monomials built (if two examples satisfy the same monomials, they belong to the same subset of the partition). When no further addition of a literal de reases the Z value, a new monomial is reated and initialized at ;, and then is grown using the same prin iple. When no further reation of a monomial de reases the Z value, the algorithm stops and returns the urrent, large de ision ommittee with still empty ve tors. In the following step, WIDC al ulates these ve tors. In a previous approa h to building rule sets for problems with two lasses (Cohen & Singer, 1999), an iterative growing-pruning algorithm is designed (SLIPPER). The rule-growing approa h of SLIPPER is ertainly lose to whatWIDC does for growing a DC sin e it optimizes a Z riterion, yet a notable di eren e is that it does not ompute Z over a partition indu ed by a set of rules. Rather, the hoi e of SLIPPER is to grow at ea h step a single monomial, prune it, and then grow a se ond monomial, prune it, and so on until a nal DNF-shaped formula is omplete and returned. Noti e that SLIPPER also modi es the weight of the examples, in a ordan e with Boosting's standards (S hapire & Singer, 1998)."

A striking result we also give, not related to the purpose of the paper, is that it is a tually the maximization of Z whi h is NP -Hard.\nThen, we present the approximation algorithm we have built and implemented to optimize the omputation of ~v in our setting ( omponents of ~v in the set f 1; 0;+1g), along with its properties. While we feel that the ideas used to minimize Z in the setting of S hapire & Singer (1998) an be adapted to our setting to provide an algorithm that is always optimal, our algorithm has the advantage to be simple, fast, and also optimal for numerous ases.

      "text" : "As previously argued in Theorem 4, minimizing Z in the setting of S hapire & Singer (1998)\nan be done optimally, but at the expense of omplex optimization pro edures, with large omplexities. One an wonder whether su h pro edures, to optimize only the omputation of ~v (a small part of WIDC), are really well worth the adaptation to our setting, in whi h more values are authorized. We are now going to show that a mu h simpler ombinatorial pro edure, with omparatively very low omplexity, an bring optimal results in fairly general situations. The most simple way to des ribe most of these situations is to make the following assumption on the examples:\n(A) Ea h example used to ompute ~v has only one \\1\" in its lass ve tor.\nA areful reading of assumption (A) reveals that it implies that ea h example belongs to exa tly one lass, but it does not prevent an observation to be element of more than one\nlass, as long as di erent examples sharing the same observation have di erent lasses (the \\1\" of the lass ve tors is in di erent positions among these examples). Therefore, even if it does not integrate the most general features of the ranking loss setting, our assumption still authorizes to onsider problems with non zero Bayes optimum. This is really interesting, as many ommonly used datasets fall into the ategory of our assumption, as for example many datasets of the UCI repository of Ma hine Learning database (Blake et al., 1998). Finally, even if the assumption does not hold, we show that in many of the remaining (interesting)\nases, our approximation algorithm is asymptoti ally optimal, that is, nds solutions loser\nto the minimal value of Z as in reases.\nSuppose for now that (A) holds. Our obje tive is to al ulate the ve tor ~v of some\nmonomial t. We use the shorthands W\n+ 0 ;W + 1 ; :::;W + 1 to denote the sum of weights of\nthe examples satisfying t and belonging respe tively to lasses 0; 1; :::; 1. We want to minimize Z as proposed in eq. (3). Suppose without loss of generality that\nW\n+ 0 W + 1\n::: W\n+\n1\n;\notherwise, reorder the lasses so that they verify this assertion. Given only three possible values for ea h omponent of ~v, the testing of all 3 possibilities for ~v is exponential and time- onsuming. But we an propose a very fast approa h. We have indeed\nLemma 1 81 j < k ; ~v[j℄ ~v[k℄ .\nProof: See the Appendix.\nThus, the optimal ~v does not belong to a set of ardinality 3 , but to a set of ardinality\nO(\n2\n). Our algorithm is then straightforward: simply explore this set of O(\n2\n) elements,\nand keep the ve tor having the lowest value of Z. Note that this ombinatorial algorithm has the advantage to be adaptable to more general settings in whi h l parti ular values are authorized for the omponents of ~v, for any xed l not ne essarily equal to 3. In that ase, the omplexity is larger, but limited to O( l 1 ).\nThere are slightly more general settings in whi h our algorithm remains optimal, in\nparti ular when we an ertify 8j; k, ((W\n+ j > W +\nk\n) , (8i 6= j; k : W\nj;i\n> W\nk;i\n)) _ ((W\n+ j <\nW\n+ k ) , (8i 6= j; k : W j;i > W k;i )). Here, W + x denotes the sum of weights of the examples\nbelonging at least to lass x, andW\nx;y\ndenotes the sum of weights of the examples belonging\nat least to lass x, and not belonging at least to lass y. This shows that even for some parti ular multilabel ases, our approximation algorithm an remain optimal. One an wonder if the optimality is preserved in the unrestri ted multilabel framework. We now show that, if optimality is not preserved, we an still prove the quality of our algorithm for general multilabel ases, showing asymptoti optimality as in reases.\nOur approximation algorithm is run in the multilabel ase by transforming the examples\nas follows: ea h example (o;~\no\n) for whi h 1\n~\no\n> 1 is transformed into 1\n~\no\nexamples, having\nthe same des ription o, and only one \\1\" in their ve tor, in su h a way that we span the 1\n~\no\n> 1 \\1\" of the original example. Their weight is the one of the original example, divided\nby 1\n~\no\n. We then run our algorithm on this new set of examples satisfying assumption (A).\nNow, suppose that for any example (o;~\no\n), we have 1\n~\no\nk for some k. There are two\ninteresting ve tors we use. The rst one is ~v , the optimal ve tor (or an optimal ve tor) minimizing Z over the original set of examples, the se ond one is ~v, the ve tor we nd minimizing Z over the transformed set of examples. What we want is to estimate the quality of ~v with respe t to the optimal value of Z over the original set of examples, Z(~v ) using our notation. The following theorem gives an answer to this problem, by quantifying its onvergen e towards Z(~v ).\nTheorem 6 Z(~v) < Z(~v ) 1 +\ne\nk\n.\nProof: See the Appendix.\nTherefore, in the set of all problems for whi h for some < 1, k , we obtain\nZ(~v) = (1+o(1))Z(~v ), and our bound onverges to the optimum as in reases in this lass of problems. By means of words, our simple approximation algorithm is quite eÆ ient for problems with large number of lasses. Note that using a slightly more involved proof, we\nould have redu ed the onstant \\e\" fa tor in Theorem 6 to the slightly smaller \\e (1=e)\". Now, to x the ideas, the following subse tion displays the expli it (and simple) solution when there are only two lasses."

If the lo al error after removal is not greater than the lo al error before, plus a penalty term, then we remove the node and its subtree. The penalty term makes the pruning essentially optimisti , that is, we tend to overprune the de ision tree. However, thanks to lo al uniform onvergen e results, and due to the fa t that ertain sub- lasses of de ision trees are reasonably large, Kearns & Mansour (1998) are able to prove that with high probability, the overpruning will not be too severe with respe t to the optimal subtree of the initial DT. We refer the reader to their paper for further theoreti al results, not needed here. The point is that by using the results of Kearns & Mansour (1998), we an obtain a similar test for DC.

For ea h dataset, the eventual dis retization of attributes was performed following previous re ommendations and experimental setups (de Carvalho Gomes & Gas uel, 1994).

A quantitative omparison of l\nDC\nagainst the number of nodes of the DTs shows that on\n4 datasets out of the 13 (Pole, Shuttle, Ti Ta Toe, Australian), the DCs are more than 6 times smaller, while they only in ur a loss in a ura y for 2 of them, and limited to 1.8%. For this latter problem (Ti Ta Toe), a glimpse at Table 1 shows that the DCs, with less than 7 rules on average, keeps omparatively most of the information ontained in DTs having more than a hundred leaves.

On many other domains, we observed persistent rules or sub on epts through the 10 ross-validation runs. Similarly to XD6, whenever we\nould mine the results with a suÆ iently a urate knowledge of the domain, these patterns were most interesting. For example, the DCs obtained on the LEDeven domain ontained most of the time a ombination of two rules with one literal ea h, whi h represented a very a urate way to lassify 9 out of the 10 possible lasses. On the Vote0 and Vote1 domains, we also observed onstant patterns, some of whi h are well known (Blake et al., 1998) to provide a very a urate lassi ation for a tiny size. Even for Vote1 where lassi al studies often report errors over 12%, and almost never around 10% (Holte, 1993), we observed on most of the runs a DC ontaining an a urate rule with two literals only, with whi h WIDC(p) provided on average an error under 10%.\nWIDC was also ompared to C4.5 on a real world domain on whi h mining issues are as ru ial as lassi ation strength: agri ulture. An experiment is being arried out in Martinique by the DDAF (Departmental Dire tion of Agri ulture and Forest), to a hieve better understanding of the behavior of farmers, in parti ular regarding their willingness to ontra t a CTE (Farming Territorial Contra t). Usual farming ontra ts with either the state (Fran e) or Europe did not ontain ommitments for the farmer to satisfy. In a CTE, ea h farmer ommits to adapt and/or hange his agri ultural te hniques or produ tions, to ensure sustainable development for lo al agri ulture. In ex hange for this, he re eives the guarantee to obtain nan ial help for this ontra t, and to be trained to new agri ultural te hniques. Su h a domain is a good test bed to evaluate a method on the basis of predi tability and interpretability, be ause of the pla e of un ertainty in agri ulture, and the fa t that obtaining data an be a hard and long task : the DDAF has to be as a -\nurate as possible in its predi tions and interpretations, to manage as best as possible its relationships with farmers, and in the ase of CTEs, to make the best promotion ampaign for these new ontra ts. Agri ulture is also very sensitive to a \\show ase e e t\": provided even few representative farmers will have subs ribed to the ontra ts, omparatively many others are likely to follow.\nIn this study, from the des ription of 52 variables for about 60 representative farmers satisfying the riteria to adhere to a CTE, the aim is to develop models for those who are a tually willing to adhere, those not willing to adhere, and those urrently un ertain. Variables are data on ea h agri ultural exploitation (size, terrain nature, nan ial data, type of produ tion, et .), as well as more personal data on the farmers (edu ation, family status, obje tives, personal answer to a questionnaire, et .). This represents a small dataset to mine, but, interestingly, the results obtained were di erent when pro essing it with C4.5 or WIDC(p).\nadhere ? :adhere\nWe ran both algorithms in a 10-fold strati ed ross-validation experiment.

The \\?\" (un ertain farmers) is predi ted only by the default ve tor.

The DTs indu ed also ontained one or two more literals separating the \\adhere\" and \\?\" lasses (average error: 6:7%), but only few other things ould be mined from the trees of C4.5, in the light of the problem addressed.\nRule 2 in Figure 3 did not have the equivalent in the DTs indu ed. What it says is interesting for the DDAF, be ause it brings the following on lusion: farmers without ongoing proje ts, and not selling their produ ts only to a wholesaler, are on the knife edge for their membership (either in \\adhere\", or in \\:adhere\"). Without going further into lo al agri ultural onsiderations, this rule, for the DDAF Engineers, represents an a urate view of the farmers a tually ontrolling their exploitation osts, being either for or against CTEs, and that edu ation pushes towards the membership ( ombination of rules 1 and 2), probably be ause it allows them to see the future potential bene ts of the ontra t, better than its urrent onstraints."

We have simulated orresponding datasets of 512 examples ea h, for ea h noise level. Ea h su h dataset was pro essed by WIDC(p) and C4.5, using a 10-fold- ross-validation pro edure. Figure 4 depi ts the results obtained for the errors and for the sizes of the lassi ers. The size of a DC is its whole number of literals, and that of a DT is its number of internal nodes.\nWhile the resistan e against noise seems to be relatively well distributed amongWIDC(p)\nand C4.5 (WIDC(p) seems to perform better for lass noise, while C4.5 seems to perform better for attribute noise), a phenomenon more interesting omes from the sizes of the formulas indu ed. First, the DCs have very small size u tuations ompared to the DTs : for\nlass noises greater than 20%, the DTs have size in reasing by a fa tor of 1.5-2. Se ond, note that the ratio between the number of nodes of the target DT, and the number of literals\nof the target DC is 3. For a majority of lass or attribute noise levels, the ratio between the DTs build and the DCs built is > 3, with a pathologi ase for 10% attribute noise, for whi h the ratio is > 6. These remarks, along with the fa t that the DCs built have a very reasonable size when ompared to that of the target DC for any type and level of noise, tend to show a good noise handling for WIDC(p). Apart from these onsiderations, glimpses at the DCs output by WIDC(p) show that even for large noise levels, it manages to nd\non epts synta ti ally lose to the target DC. For example, one of the DCs output at 30% lass noise is exa tly the target DC; also, it is only for lass noise 12% (and attribute\nnoise 16%) that some DCs found do not synta ti ally in lude the target DC anymore."

This paper addresses from a theoreti al and empiri al point of view the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep lassi ation strength. In order to ope with this problem, we have hosen to study a lass of on ept representations resembling multilinear dis riminant polynomials, adequate for mining issues when dealing with voting pro edures, whi h we de ne as De ision Committees. Our theoreti al results show that striving for simpli ity is, like for many other lasses of on ept representations, a hard omputational problem when dealing with DC or other omplex voting pro edures, and proves the heuristi nature of other results trying to prune adaptive boosting. This paper proposes to adapt a previous s heme to build weak learners, su essful for the indu tion of de ision trees and de ision lists, to the ase of DC. This is an original approa h if we refer to the state-of-the-art algorithms building omplex votes pro edures, usually working in the strong learning framework. Our algorithm, WIDC, relies on re ents or new results about partition boosting, ranking loss boosting, and pruning. It omes with two avors, one with optimisti pruning and one with pessimisti pruning. Both obtained experimentally good results on the simpli ity-a ura y tradeo , but whereas optimisti pruning learly outperforms other algorithms in the light of the size of the formulas obtained, pessimisti pruning tends to a hieve a more reasonable tradeo , with high a ura ies obtained on small formulas. This is all the more interesting as pessimisti pruning is based on a natural and simple pruning pro edure."

If it ontains exa tly one negative literal, it is satis ed by exa tly one positive example, and we an repla e it by the monotonous monomial with jSj 1 positive literals (we leave empty the position of the initial negative literal). Consequently, similarly for t\n1\n, we an suppose that t\n2\nis monotonous. We distinguish\ntwo ases.\n{ If j\n1\nj > j\n2\nj, no positive example an satisfy t\n1\n.

First, we an suppose that f is again monotonous (Kearns et al., 1987). Then, sin e ea h positive example satis es at least one monomial ( =\\-\"), then for all variable, there exists a monomial whi h does not ontain the orresponding positive literal.

    "abstractText" : "Re ent advan es in the study of voting lassi ation algorithms have brought empiri al and theoreti al results learly showing the dis rimination power of ensemble lassi ers. It has been previously argued that the sear h of this lassi ation power in the design of the algorithms has marginalized the need to obtain interpretable lassi ers. Therefore, the question of whether one might have to dispense with interpretability in order to keep lassi ation strength is being raised in a growing number of ma hine learning or data mining papers. The purpose of this paper is to study both theoreti ally and empiri ally the problem. First, we provide numerous results giving insight into the hardness of the simpli ity-a ura y tradeo for voting lassi ers. Then we provide an eÆ ient \\top-down and prune\" indu tion heuristi , WIDC, mainly derived from re ent results on the weak learning and boosting frameworks. It is to our knowledge the rst attempt to build a voting lassi er as a base formula using the weak learning framework (the one whi h was previously highly su essful for de ision tree indu tion), and not the strong learning framework (as usual for su h lassi ers with boosting-like approa hes). While it uses a well-known indu tion s heme previously su essful in other lasses of on ept representations, thus making it easy to implement and ompare, WIDC also relies on re ent or new results we give about parti ular ases of boosting known as partition boosting and ranking loss boosting. Experimental results on thirty-one domains, most of whi h readily available, tend to display the ability of WIDC to produ e small, a urate, and interpretable de ision ommittees.",
