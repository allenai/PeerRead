Our algorithm is computationally efficient, assuming access to an offline optimization oracle, and enjoys a regret of order $O((KT)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\log N)^{\\frac{1}{3}})$, where $K$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is the number of baseline policies. Our result is the first to break the $O(T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ barrier that is achieved by recently introduced algorithms. Breaking this barrier was left as a major open problem. Our analysis is based on the recent relaxation based approach of (Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2016).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 14:47:19 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00313v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vasilis syrgkanis", "haipeng luo", "akshay krishnamurthy", "robert e schapire"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00313"}
