{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to Nonlinear Invariants", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a scalable version of a state-of-the-art deterministic time- invariant feature extraction approach based on consecutive changes of basis and nonlinearities, namely, the scattering network. The first focus of the paper is to extend the scattering network to allow the use of higher order nonlinearities as well as extracting nonlinear and Fourier based statistics leading to the required in- variants of any inherently structured input. In order to reach fast convolutions and to leverage the intrinsic structure of wavelets, we derive our complete model in the Fourier domain. In addition of providing fast computations, we are now able to exploit sparse matrices due to extremely high sparsity well localized in the Fourier domain. As a result, we are able to reach a true linear time complexity with in- puts in the Fourier domain allowing fast and energy efficient solutions to machine learning tasks. Validation of the features and computational results will be pre- sented through the use of these invariant coefficients to perform classification on audio recordings of bird songs captured in multiple different soundscapes. In the end, the applicability of the presented solutions to deep artificial neural networks is discussed.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "Overview: This work seems very promising, but I believe it should be compared with more baselines, and more precisely described and explained, from a signal processing point of view.\n\nPros:\nNew descriptor\nFast implementation\n\nCons:\na) Lack of rigor\nb) Too long accordingly to the content\nc) The computational gain of the algorithm is not clear\nd) The work is not compared with its most obvious baseline: a scattering transform\n\nI will detail each cons.\n\na) Section 1:\nThe author\u00a0 motivates the use of scattering transform because it defines a contraction of the space that relies on geometric features.\n\" The nonlinearity used in the scattering network is the complex modulus which is piecewise linear.\"\nA real modulus is piecewise linear.

Because point-wise squaring can be written as a convolution in the Fourier domain, when doing all the operations in the Fourier this architecture becomes 'dual': convolutions become pointwise operations, and pointwise square-nonlinearities become convolutions. \n The authors study this architecture in the context of scattering transforms and produce a complexity analysis that exploits the previous property, along with preliminary numerical experiments. \n \n All reviewers agreed that, while this is an interesting paper with potentially useful outcomes, its exposition and current experimental section are insufficient. The AC agrees with this assessment, and therefore recommends rejection. \n I agree that the main unanswered question and a 'show-stopper' is the lack of comparisons with its most immediate baseline, scattering using complex modulus, both in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "I find the general direction of the work is promising but, in my opinion, the paper has three main drawback. While the motivation and overall idea seem very reasonable, the derivation is not convincing mathematically. The experiments are limited and the presentation needs significant improvement.  The writing and wording are in general poorly structured to the point that it is sometimes difficult to follow the proposed ideas. The overall organization needs improvement and the connection between sections is not properly established. The paper could be significantly improved by simply re-writing it.\n\nI'm not fully convinced by the motivation for the proposed non-linearity (|c|^2), as described on page 5. The authors argue that  (Waldspurger, 2016) suggests that higher order nonlinearities might be  beneficial for sparsity. But unless I'm missing something, that work seems  to suggest that in the general case higher order nonlinearities can be neglected. Could you please comment on this?\n\nOn the other hand, adding a second order term to the descriptor seems\nan interesting direction, as long as stability to small variations is preserved (which should be shown experimentally)\n\nThe experimental section is rather limited. The paper would be stronger with a thorough numerical evaluation. The presented results, in my opinion, do not show convincingly a clear advantage of the proposed method over a standard implementation of the scattering transform. In order to show the merits of the proposed approach, it would be really helpful to directly compare running times and compression rates.\n\nQuestions: \n- Can you show empirically that the proposed higher order nonlinearity\nproduces sparser representations than the complex modulus?\n\nOther minor issues:\n- The proof of Section 2.1, should be preceded by a clear statement in the form of a proposition\n- \"Hadamart\" -> Hadamard\n- \"Valid set\" -> Validation set\n- \"nonzeros coefficients\" -> nonzero coefficients\n- Figure 3 is difficult to understand. Please provide more details.\n- Figure 5 is supposed to show a comparison to a standard implementation of the Scattering network, but it doesn't seem to be such comparison in that figure. Please explain.\n- Please verify the references.

Unfortunately, they are poorly described and evaluated. If the writing was clear and the evaluation more broad, I would have recommended acceptance since the ideas have merit.\n\nOne of the biggest faults of the presentation is that many sentences are overly long and full of unnecessary obfuscating language, e.g. the last paragraph of Section 1 (though unfortunately this permeates the whole paper).\n\nLikewise, most equations are made unnecessarily complicated. For example, Eq. 5 does not need 4 lines and so many indexes, but just 2:\nX_0 = x\nX_l = |X_{l-1} * Psi_l|\nwith the |.| operator being element-wise. Most of the hyperparameter dependencies and indexes are not necessary, as well as the repetition of iterations. The same reasoning can be applied to most Equations 5 to 13.\n\nThe argument of cardinality (Eq. 14) does not really help prove that variance is more informative. In fact, we could just as easily write that the cardinality of S concatenated with any (!) other quantity is >= the cardinality of S. Another argument from machine learning theory would be better.\n\nThe authors should strive to make the arguments in the paper less hyperbolic and better substantiated. The claims about finding invariants of any input (Abstract) and fundamental structures (last paragraph of Section 1.2.1) are not really backed up by any math. How can we have any guarantees about singling out, for example, semantically relevant representations? The learning procedures in machine learning give at least some guarantees, while here the feature building seems a bit more heuristic.
