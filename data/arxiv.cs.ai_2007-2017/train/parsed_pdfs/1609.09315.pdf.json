      "text" : "Neural approaches, in particular attention-based sequence-to-sequence models, have shown great promise and obtained state-of-the-art performance for sequence transduction tasks including machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), syntactic constituency parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015), and semantic role labelling (Zhou and Xu, 2015). A key requirement for effectively training such models is an abundance of supervised data.\nIn this paper we focus on learning mappings from input sequences x to output sequences y in domains where the latter are easily obtained, but annotation in the form of (x, y) pairs is sparse or expensive to produce, and propose a novel architecture that accommodates semi-supervised training on sequence transduction tasks. To this end, we augment the transduction objective (x 7→ y) with an autoencoding objective where the input sequence is treated as a latent variable (y 7→ x 7→ y), enabling training from both labelled pairs and unpaired output sequences.\nThis is common in situations where we encode natural language into a logical form governed by some grammar or database.\nWhile such an autoencoder could in principle be constructed by stacking two sequence transducers, modelling the latent variable as a series of discrete symbols drawn from multinomial distributions creates serious computational challenges, as it requires marginalising over the space of latent sequences Σ∗x. To avoid this intractable marginalisation, we introduce a novel differentiable alternative for draws from a softmax which can be used with the reparametrisation trick of Kingma and Welling (2014). Rather than drawing a discrete symbol in Σx from a softmax, we draw a distribution over symbols from a logistic-normal distribution at each time step. These serve as continuous relaxations of discrete samples, providing a differentiable estimator of the expected reconstruction log likelihood.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on three semantic parsing tasks: the GEOQUERY benchmark (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Wong and Mooney, 2006), the SAIL maze navigation task (MacMahon et al., 2006) and the Natural Language Querying corpus (Haas and Riezler, 2016) on OpenStreetMap. As part of our evaluation, we introduce simple mechanisms for generating large amounts of unsupervised training data for two of these tasks.\nIn most settings, the semi-supervised model outperforms the supervised model, both when trained on additional generated data as well as on subsets of the existing data.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n09 31\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 Se\np 20"

More precisely, the model consists of four LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), hence the name SEQ4. The first, a bidirectional LSTM, encodes the sequence y; next, an LSTM with stochastic output, described below, draws a sequence of distributions x̃ over words in vocabulary Σx.

The use of a logistic normal distribution serves to regularise the model in the semi-supervised learning regime, which is described at the end of this section.

We define a loss on this reconstruction which accommodates the unsupervised case, where x is not observed in the training data, and the supervised case, where (x, y) pairs are available. Together, these allow us to train the SEQ4 model in a semi-supervised setting, which experiments will show provides some benefits over a purely supervised training regime.\nUnsupervised case When x isn’t observed, the loss we minimise during training is the reconstruction loss on y, expressed as the negative loglikelihood NLL(ŷ, y) of the true labels y relative to the predictions ŷ. To this, we add as a regularising\n2Multiplying the distribution over words and an embedding matrix averages the word embedding of the entire vocabulary weighted by their probabilities.\nterm the KL divergence KL[q(γ|y)‖p(γ)] which effectively penalises the mean and variance of q(γ|y) from diverging from those of a prior p(γ), which we model as a diagonal Gaussian N (0, I). This has the effect of smoothing the logistic normal distribution from which we draw the distributions over symbols of x, guarding against overfitting of the latent distributions over x to symbols seen in the supervised case discussed below. The unsupervised loss is therefore formalised as\nLunsup = NLL(ŷ, y) + αKL[q(γ|y)‖p(γ)] (12)\nwith regularising factor α is tuned on validation, and\nKL[q(γ|y)‖p(γ)] = Lx∑ i=1 KL[q(γi|y)‖p(γ)] (13)\nWe use a closed form of these individual KL divergences, described by Kingma and Welling (2014).\nSupervised case When x is observed, we additionally minimise the prediction loss on x, expressed as the negative log-likelihoodNLL(x̃, x) of the true labels x relative to the predictions x̃, and do not impose the KL loss. The supervised loss is thus\nLsup = NLL(x̃, x) +NLL(ŷ, y) (14)\nIn both the supervised and unsupervised case, because of the continuous relaxation on generating x̃ and the reparameterisation trick, the gradient of the losses with regard to the model parameters is well defined throughout SEQ4.\nSemi-supervised training and inference We train with a weighted combination of the supervised and unsupervised losses described above. Once trained, we simply use the x 7→ y decoder segment of the model to predict y from sequences of symbols x represented as one-hot vectors. When the decoder is trained without the encoder in a fully supervised manner, it serves as our supervised sequenceto-sequence baseline model under the name S2S."

These mazes come together with a large number of human instructions paired with the required actions4 to reach the goal\n3We removed quotes, added spaces around (), and separated the question mark from the last word in each question.\n4There are four actions: LEFT, RIGHT, GO, STOP.\nstate described in those instructions.

Albeit that is a reasonable assumption for real world data, the datasets considered have no such component, thus the approach taken here is to generate random database queries or maze paths, i.e. the machine readable side of the data, and train a semi-supervised model. The alternative not explored here would be to generate natural language questions or instructions instead, but that is more difficult to achieve without human intervention. For this reason, we generate the machine readable side of the data for GEOQUERY and SAIL tasks5.\nFor GEOQUERY, we fit a 3-gram Kneser-Ney (Chen and Goodman, 1999) model to the queries in the training set and sample about 7 million queries from it. We ensure that the sampled queries are different from the training queries, but do not enforce validity. This intentionally simplistic approach is to demonstrate the applicability of our model.\nThe SAIL dataset has only three mazes. We added a fourth one and over 150k random paths, including duplicates. The new maze is larger (21× 21 grid) than the existing ones, and seeks to approximately replicate the key statistics of the other three mazes (maximum corridor length, distribution of objects, etc). Paths within that maze are created by randomly sampling start and end positions."

While a simple instruction such as ‘turn left’ can easily be translated into the action sequence LEFT-STOP, more complex instructions such as ‘Walk forward until you see a lamp’ require knowledge of the agent’s position in the maze.\nTo accomplish this we modify the model as follows. First, when encoding action sequences, we concatenate each action with a representation of the maze at the given position, representing the mazestate akin to Mei et al. (2016) with a bag-of-features vector. Second, when decoding action sequences, the RNN outputs an action which is used to update the agent’s position and the representation of that new position is fed into the RNN as its next input.\nTraining regime We cross-validate over the three mazes in the dataset and report overall results weighted by test size (cf. Mei et al. (2016)). Both our supervised and semi-supervised model perform worse than the state-of-the-art (see Table 6), but the latter enjoys a comfortable margin over the former.

      "text" : "encoded with bidirectional LSTMs. With a unidirectional LSTM we get similar results to theirs.\nOn the SAIL corpus, S2S performs worse than the state of the art. As the models are broadly equivalent we attribute this difference to a number of taskspecific choices and optimisations7 made in Mei et al. (2016) which we did not reimplement for the sake of using a common model across all three tasks.\nFor NLMAPS, S2S performs much better than the state-of-the-art, exceeding the previous best result by 11% despite a very simple tokenization method\n7In particular we don’t use beam search and ensembling.\nand a lack of any form of entity anonymisation.\nSemi-supervised training In both the case of GEOQUERY and the SAIL task we found the semisupervised model to convincingly outperform the fully supervised model. The effect was particularly notable in the case of the SAIL corpus, where performance increased from 58.60% accuracy to 63.25% (see Table 6). It is worth remembering that the supervised training regime consists of three folds of tuning on two maps with subsequent testing on the third map, which carries a risk of overfitting to the training maps. The introduction of the fourth unsupervised map clearly mitigates this effect. Table 8 shows some examples of unsupervised logical forms being transformed into natural language, which demonstrate how the model can learn to sensibly ground unsupervised data.\nAblation performance The experiments with additional unsupervised data prove the feasibility of our approach and clearly demonstrate the usefulness of the SEQ4 model for the general class of sequence-to-sequence tasks where supervised data is hard to come by. To analyse the model further, we also look at the performance of both S2S and SEQ4 when reducing the amount of supervised training data available to the model. We compare three settings: the supervised S2S model with reduced training data, SEQ4- which uses the removed training data in an unsupervised fashion (throwing away the natural language) and SEQ4+ which uses the randomly generated unsupervised data described in Section 3. The S2S model behaves as expected on all three tasks, its performance dropping with the size of the training data. The performance of SEQ4and SEQ4+ requires more analysis.\nIn the case of GEOQUERY, having unlabelled data from the true distribution (SEQ4-) is a good thing\nwhen there is enough of it, as clearly seen when only 5% of the original dataset is used for supervised training and the remaining 95% is used for unsupervised training. The gap shrinks as the amount of supervised data is increased, which is as expected. On the other hand, using a large amount of extra, generated data from an approximating distribution (SEQ4+) does not help as much initially when compared with the unsupervised data from the true distribution. However, as the size of the unsupervised dataset in SEQ4- becomes the bottleneck this gap closes and eventually the model trained on the extra data achieves higher accuracy.\nFor the SAIL task the semi-supervised models do better than the supervised results throughout, with the model trained on randomly generated additional data consistently outperforming the model trained only on the original data. This gives further credence to the risk of overfitting to the training mazes already mentioned above.\nFinally, in the case of the NLMAPS corpus, the semi-supervised approach does not appear to help much at any point during the ablation. These indistinguishable results are likely due to the task’s complexity, causing the ablation experiments to either have to little supervised data to sufficiently ground the latent space to make use of the unsupervised data, or in the higher percentages then too little unsupervised data to meaningfully improve the model."

      "text" : "Semantic parsing The tasks in this paper all broadly belong to the domain of semantic parsing, which describes the process of mapping natural language to a formal representation of its meaning. This is extended in the SAIL navigation task, where the formal representation is a function of both the language instruction and a given environment.\nSemantic parsing is a well-studied problem with numerous approaches including inductive logic programming (Zelle and Mooney, 1996), stringto-tree (Galley et al., 2004) and string-to-graph (Jones et al., 2012) transducers, grammar induction (Kwiatkowski et al., 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2013; Reddy et al., 2014) or machine translation (Wong and Mooney, 2006; Andreas et al., 2013).\nWhile a large number of relevant literature fo-\ncuses on defining the grammar of the logical forms (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), other models learn purely from aligned pairs of text and logical form (Berant and Liang, 2014), or from more weakly supervised signals such as question-answer pairs together with a database (Liang et al., 2011). Recent work of Jia and Liang (2016) induces a synchronous context-free grammar and generates additional training examples (x, y), which is one way to address data scarcity issues. The semi-supervised setup proposed here offers an alternative solution to this issue.\nDiscrete autoencoders Very recently there has been some related work on discrete autoencoders for natural language processing (Suster et al., 2016; Marcheggiani and Titov, 2016, i.a.) This work presents a first approach to using effectively discretised sequential information as the latent representation without resorting to draconian assumptions (Ammar et al., 2014) to make marginalisation tractable. While our model is not exactly marginalisable either, the continuous relaxation makes training far more tractable. A related idea was recently presented in Gülçehre et al. (2015), who use monolingual data to improve machine translation by fusing a sequence-to-sequence model and a language model."

Across multiple semantic parsing tasks we demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, improving model performance by training on randomly generated unsupervised data in addition to the original data.\nGoing forward it would be interesting to further analyse the effects of sampling from a logisticnormal distribution as opposed to a softmax in order to better understand how this impacts the distribution in the latent space. While we focused on tasks with little supervised data and additional unsupervised data in y, it would be straightforward to reverse the model to train it with additional labelled data in x, i.e. on the natural language side. A natural extension would also be a formulation where semisupervised training was performed in both x and y.\nFor instance, machine translation lends itself to such a formulation where for many language pairs parallel data may be scarce while there is an abundance of monolingual data."
