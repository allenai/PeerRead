Pontelli (Eds.), LNCS 5366, pp. 99–113, Springer, 2008.\nas, e.g., DLV (Leone et al. 2006), Smodels (Simons et al. 2002), clasp (Gebser et al. 2007), GnT (Janhunen and Niemelä 2004), and ASSAT (Lin and Zhao 2004). Initially providing a semantics for rules with default negation in the body, the answer-set semantics (or stablemodel semantics) (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1991) has been continually extended in terms of expressiveness and syntactic freedom. Starting with disjunctive rules, allowing for disjunctions in rule heads, negation in rule heads was considered and the development continued by allowing nested expressions, i.e., implication-free propositional formulas in the head and the body. Eventually, arbitrary propositional theories were given a non-classical minimal model semantics as their answer sets, which has recently been lifted to a general answer-set semantics for first-order theories (Ferraris et al. 2007).\nIn a different line of research, the restriction to Herbrand domains for programs with variables, i.e., non-ground programs, has been relaxed in order to cope with open domains (Heymans et al. 2007), which is desirable for certain applications, e.g., in conceptual modelling and Semantic Web reasoning. The resulting open answer-set semantics has been further generalized by dropping the unique names assumption (Heymans et al. 2008) for application settings where it does not apply, for instance, when combining ontologies with nonmontonic rules (de Bruijn et al. 2007).\nAs for a logical characterization of the answer-set semantics, the logic of Here-andThere (HT), a nonclassical logic extending intuitionistic logic, served as a basis. Equilibrium Logic selects certain minimal HT-models for characterizing the answer-set semantics for propositional theories and programs. It has recently been extended to Quantified Equilibrium Logic (QEL) for first-order theories on the basis of a quantified version of Here-and-There (QHT) (Pearce and Valverde 2006; Pearce and Valverde 2008). Equilibrium Logic serves as a viable formalism for the study of semantic comparisons of theories and programs, like different notions of equivalence (Eiter et al. 2005; Lifschitz et al. 2007; Woltran 2008; Faber and Konczak 2006; Faber et al. 2008; Inoue and Sakama 2004). The practical relevance of this research originates in program optimization tasks that rely on modifications that preserve certain properties (Eiter et al. 2006; Lin and Chen 2007; Janhunen et al. 2009; Janhunen 2008; Sakama and Inoue 2009).\nIn previous work (Fink 2008), we complemented this line of research by solving an open problem concerning uniform equivalence of propositional theories and programs. Intuitively, two propositional logic programs are uniformly equivalent if they have the same answer sets under the addition of an arbitrary set of atoms to both programs. Former characterizations of uniform equivalence, i.e., selections of HT-models based on a maximality criterion (Eiter et al. 2007), failed to capture uniform equivalence for infinite propositional programs—a problem that becomes relevant when turning to the non-ground setting, respectively first-order theories, where infinite domains, such as the natural numbers, are encountered in many application domains. In (Fink 2008), this has been remedied resorting to countermodels in HT.\nIn this article, we extend the former work beyond the basic notions of strong and uniform equivalence. So-called relativized notions thereof have been considered in order to capture more fine-grained semantical comparisons (see e.g., (Eiter et al. 2007; Pearce et al. 2007)). Intuitively, these notions restrict the alphabet to be considered for potential additions, i.e., programs or sets of facts, respectively. A further refinement distinguishes the alphabet for atoms allowed in rule heads of an addition from the alphabet for atoms allowed in rule\nbodies (Woltran 2008). The various notions of equivalence that can be formalized this way have recently been called relativized hyperequivalence (Truszczynski and Woltran 2008a; Truszczynski and Woltran 2008b).\nSimilarly as for uniform equivalence, semantic characterizations of relativized hyperequivalence have been obtained by means of a maximality criterion so far, and only for finite propositional settings. We address this issue and apply the same methods as for uniform equivalence in order to obtain alternative characterizations. They can be stated without any finiteness restrictions and easily lift to first-order settings over infinite domains.\nThe new contributions compared to (Fink 2008) can be summarized as follows:\n• We provide full proofs for the characterizations of uniform equivalence, but also classical equivalence, answer-set equivalence, and strong equivalence, in terms of countermodels in HT, respectively in terms of equivalence interpretations, developed in (Fink 2008). • We extend these ideas to relativized settings of equivalence and generalize the notion of relativized hyperequivalence to propositional theories. Abstracting from the notions of rule head and rule body, we obtain respective notions of relativization for theories. We provide novel semantical characterizations in terms of equivalence interpretations for this generalized setting, again without any finiteness restrictions. • We lift these results to first-order theories by means of QHT, essentially introducing, besides uniform equivalence, relativized hyperequivalence for first-order theories under the most general form of answer-set semantics currently considered. • We correct an informal claim that has been made in connection with a property which allows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures and holds for QHT countermodels. Based on an erroneous example (Example 5 in (Fink 2008)), it was claimed that this property does not hold for QHT-models, which is not the case. • Eventually, we reconsider logic programs and prove, using the established characterization, that uniform equivalence coincides for open and ordinary answer-set semantics, as well as other results which have been stated without proof in (Fink 2008).\nOur results provide an elegant, uniform model-theoretic framework for the characterization of the different notions of equivalence considered in ASP. They generalize to firstorder theories without finiteness restrictions, and are relevant for practical ASP systems that handle finite non-ground programs over infinite domains.\nIn particular relativized notions of equivalence are relevant in practice. For instance, program composition from modular parts is an issue of increasing interest in ASP (Dao-Tran et al. 2009; Janhunen et al. 2009). It usually hinges on semantic properties specified for an interface (input/output for ‘calling’ or connecting modules), i.e., properties that require compliance on a subset of the underlying language. Our results might be exploited to provide correctness guarantees for specific compositions.\nAnother benefit comes with the generalization to first-order theories. It facilitates and simplifies the study of combinations of ASP with other formalisms, or means for external data access, in a unifying formalism. Especially the combination of nonmonotonic rules with description logics is a highly relevant instance of such a combination. Our results can initiate or reduce difficulties in the study of modularity and optimization for such combined settings. (cf. (Fink and Pearce 2009) for preliminary work in this direction).\nFor the sake of presentation, the technical content is split into two parts, discussing the propositional case first, and addressing first-order theories and nonground programs in a second part. In particular, the organization is as follows: Section 2 introduces essential preliminaries for the treatment of the propositional case. In Section 3, we develop a characterization of uniform equivalence by means of countermodels in HT, and proceed with an alternative characterization in terms of equivalence interpretations, before we turn to generalizing and characterizing relativized hyperequivalence for propositional theories. After some introductory background on quantified HT, Section 4 deals with generalizations of previous results to first-order theories under generalized answer-set semantics. In Section 5, we apply our characterization of uniform equivalence to logic programs under various extended semantics in comparison with the traditional semantics over Herbrand domains, before we draw some conclusions in Section 6."

Furthermore we make use of the following abbreviations: φ ≡ ψ for (φ → ψ) ∧ (ψ → φ); ¬φ for φ → ⊥; and ⊤ for ⊥ → ⊥. A formula is said to be factual1 if it is built using ∧, ∨, ⊥, and ¬ (i.e., implications of the form φ → ⊥), only. A theory Γ is factual if every formula of Γ has this property.\nThe logic of here-and-there is an intermediate logic between intuitionistic logic and classical logic. Like intuitionistic logic it can be semantically characterized by Kripke models, in particular using just two worlds, namely “here” and “there” (assuming that the here world is ordered before the there world). Accordingly, interpretations (HT-interpretations) are pairs (X,Y ) of sets of atoms from L, such that X ⊆ Y . An HT-interpretation is total if X = Y . The intuition is that atoms in X (the here part) are considered to be true, atoms not in Y (the there part) are considered to be false, while the remaining atoms (from Y \\X) are undefined.\nWe denote classical satisfaction of a formulaφ by an interpretationX , i.e., a set of atoms, as X |= φ, whereas satisfaction in the logic of here-and-there (an HT-model), symbolically (X,Y ) |= φ, is defined recursively:\n1. (X,Y ) |= a if a ∈ X , for any atom a, 2. (X,Y ) 6|= ⊥, 3. (X,Y ) |= φ ∧ ψ if (X,Y ) |= φ and (X,Y ) |= ψ,\n1 When uniform equivalence of theories is considered, then factual theories can be considered instead of facts— hence the terminology—see also the discussion at the end of this section.\n4. (X,Y ) |= φ ∨ ψ if (X,Y ) |= φ or (X,Y ) |= ψ, 5. (X,Y ) |= φ → ψ if (i) (X,Y ) 6|= φ or (X,Y ) |= ψ, and (ii) Y |= φ → ψ2.\nAn HT-interpretation (X,Y ) satisfies a theory Γ, iff it satisfies all formulas φ ∈ Γ. For an axiomatic proof system see, e.g., (Lifschitz et al. 2007).\nA total HT-interpretation (Y, Y ) is called an equilibrium model of a theoryΓ, iff (Y, Y ) |= Γ and for all HT-interpretations (X,Y ), such that X ⊂ Y , it holds that (X,Y ) 6|= Γ. An interpretation Y is an answer set of Γ iff (Y, Y ) is an equilibrium model of Γ.\nWe will make use of the following simple properties: if (X,Y ) |= Γ then (Y, Y ) |= Γ; and (X,Y ) |= ¬φ iff Y |= ¬φ; as well as of the following lemma.\nLemma 1 (Lemma 5 in (Pearce and Valverde 2004))\nIf φ is a factual propositional formula, (X,Y ) |= φ, and X ⊆ X ′ ⊆ Y , then (X ′, Y ) |= φ."

      "text" : "For any two theories, respectively programs, and a potential extension by Γ, we consider the following notions of equivalence which have been shown to be the only forms of equivalence obtained by varying the logical form of extensions in the propositional case in (Pearce and Valverde 2004).\n2 That is, Y satisfies φ → ψ classically.\nDefinition 1 Two theories Γ1,Γ2 over L are called\n• classically equivalent, Γ1 ≡c Γ2, if and only if they have the same classical models; • answer-set equivalent, Γ1 ≡a Γ2, if and only if they have the same answer sets, i.e.,\nequilibrium models; • strongly equivalent, Γ1 ≡s Γ2, if and only if, for any theory Γ over L′ ⊇ L, Γ1 ∪ Γ\nand Γ2 ∪ Γ are answer-set equivalent; • uniformly equivalent,Γ1 ≡u Γ2, if and only if, for any factual theory Γ over L′ ⊇ L, Γ1 ∪ Γ and Γ2 ∪ Γ are answer-set equivalent.\nEmanating from a logic programming setting, uniform equivalence is usually understood wrt. sets of facts (i.e., atoms). Obviously, uniform equivalence wrt. factual theories implies uniform equivalence wrt. sets of facts. The converse direction has been shown as well for general propositional theories (cf. Theorem 2 in (Pearce and Valverde 2004)). Therefore, in general there is no difference whether uniform equivalence is considered wrt. sets of facts or factual theories. The latter may be regarded as facts, i.e., rules with an empty body, of so-called nested logic program rules. One might also consider sets of disjunctions of atomic formulas and their negations (i.e., clauses), accounting for facts according to the definition of program rules in this article. Note that clauses constitute factual formulas and the classical transformation of clauses into implications is not valid under answer set semantics (respectively in HT)."

The set of HT-countermodels of a theory Γ is denoted by Cs(Γ).\nIntuitively, an HT-interpretation fails to be an HT-model of a theory Γ when the theory is not satisfied at one of the worlds (here or there). Note that satisfaction at the there world amounts to classical satisfaction of the theory by Y . A simple consequence is that if Y 6|= Γ, then (X,Y ) is an HT countermodel of Γ for any X ⊆ Y . At the here world, classical satisfaction is a sufficient condition but not necessary. For logic programs, satisfaction at the here world is precisely captured by the reduct of the program Π wrt. the interpretation at the there world, i.e., if X |= ΠY .\nDefinition 3\nA total HT-interpretation (Y, Y ) is total-closed in a set S of HT-interpretations if (X,Y ) ∈ S for every X ⊆ Y . We say that an HT-interpretation (X,Y ) is\n• closed in a set S of HT-interpretations if (X ′, Y ) ∈ S for every X ⊆ X ′ ⊆ Y . • there-closed in a set S of HT-interpretations if (Y, Y ) 6∈ S and (X ′, Y ) ∈ S for every X ⊆ X ′ ⊂ Y .\nA set S of HT-interpretations is total-closed, if every total HT-interpretation (Y, Y ) ∈ S is total-closed in S. By the remarks on the satisfaction at the there world above, it is obvious that every total HT-countermodel of a theory is also total-closed in Cs(Γ). Consequently, Cs(Γ) is a total-closed set for any theory Γ. By the same argument, if (X,Y ) is an HT-countermodel such that X ⊂ Y and Y 6|= Γ, then (X,Y ) is closed in Cs(Γ). The more relevant cases concerning the characterization of equivalence are HT-countermodels (X,Y ) such that Y |= Γ.\nExample 2\nConsider the theory Γ1 in Example 1 and a non-total HT-interpretation (X,L). Since (X,L) is non-total, X ⊂ L holds, and therefore (X,L) 6|= ai, for some ai ∈ L. Thus, we have identified a HT-countermodel of Γ1. Moreover the same argument holds for any non-total HT-interpretation of the from (X ′,L) (in particular such that X ⊆ X ′ ⊂ Y ). Therefore, (X,L) is there-closed in Cs(Γ1).\nThe intuition that, essentially, there-closed countermodels can be used instead of maximal non-total HT-models for characterizing uniform equivalence draws from the following observation. If (X,Y ) is a maximal non-total HT-model, then every (X ′, Y ), such that X ⊂ X ′ ⊂ Y , is a there-closed HT-countermodel. However, there-closed HTcountermodels are not sensitive to the problems that infinite chains cause for maximality.\nGiven a theory Γ, let Cu(Γ) denote the set of there-closed HT-interpretations in Cs(Γ).\nTheorem 1\nTwo propositional theories Γ1, Γ2 are uniformly equivalent iff they have the same sets of there-closed HT-countermodels, in symbols Γ1 ≡u Γ2 iff Cu(Γ1) = Cu(Γ2)."

      "text" : "For the only-if direction, assume that two theories, Γ1 and Γ2, are uniformly equivalent. Then they are classically equivalent, i.e., they coincide on total HT-models, and therefore also on total HT-countermodels. Since a total HT-interpretation (Y, Y ) is there-closed in Cs(Γ) if (Y, Y ) 6∈ Cs(Γ), i.e., if (Y, Y ) is an HT-model of Γ, this proves that Γ1 and Γ2 coincide on total HT-interpretations that are there-closed in Cs(Γ1), respectively in Cs(Γ2).\nTo prove our claim, it remains to show that Γ1 and Γ2 coincide on non-total thereclosed HT-countermodels (X,Y ), i.e., such that (Y, Y ) is an HT-model of both theories. Consider such a there-closed HT-countermodel of Γ1. Then, (Y, Y ) is a total HT-model of Γ1 ∪ X and no X ′ ⊂ Y exists such that (X ′, Y ) |= Γ1 ∪ X , either because it is an HT-countermodel of Γ1 (in case X ⊆ X ′ ⊂ Y ) or of X (in case X ′ ⊂ X). Thus, Y is an answer set of Γ1 ∪ X and, by hypothesis since X is factual, it is also an answer set of Γ2 ∪ X . The latter implies for all X ⊆ X ′ ⊂ Y that (X ′, Y ) 6|= Γ2 ∪ X . All these HT-interpretations are HT-models of X . Therefore we conclude that they all are HTcountermodels of Γ2 and hence (X,Y ) is a there-closed HT-countermodel of Γ2. Again by symmetric arguments, we establish the same for any there-closed HT countermodel (X,Y ) of Γ2 such that (Y, Y ) is a common total HT-model. This proves that Γ1 and Γ2 have the same sets of there-closed HT countermodels.\nFor the if direction, assume that two theories, Γ1 and Γ2, have the same sets of thereclosed HT-countermodels. This implies that they have the same total HT-models (since these are there-closed). Consider any factual theory Γ′ such that Y is an answer set of Γ1 ∪ Γ′. We show that Y is an answer set of Γ2 ∪ Γ′ as well. Clearly, (Y, Y ) |= Γ1 ∪ Γ′ implies (Y, Y ) |= Γ′ and therefore (Y, Y ) |= Γ2 ∪ Γ′. Consider any X ⊂ Y . Since Y is an answer set of Γ1 ∪ Γ′, it holds that (X,Y ) 6|= Γ1 ∪ Γ′. We show that (X,Y ) 6|= Γ2 ∪ Γ′. If (X,Y ) 6|= Γ′ this is trivial, and in particular the case if (X,Y ) |= Γ1. So let us consider the case where (X,Y ) 6|= Γ1 and (X,Y ) |= Γ′. By Lemma 1 we conclude from the latter that, for any X ⊆ X ′ ⊂ Y , (X ′, Y ) |= Γ′. Therefore, (X ′, Y ) 6|= Γ1, as well. This implies that (X,Y ) is a there-closed HT-countermodel of Γ1. By hypothesis, (X,Y ) is a there-closed HT-countermodel of Γ2, i.e., (X,Y ) 6|= Γ2. Consequently, (X,Y ) 6|= Γ2 ∪ Γ′. Since this argument applies to any X ⊂ Y , (Y, Y ) is an equilibrium model of Γ2 ∪ Γ′, i.e., Y is an answer set of Γ2 ∪ Γ′. The argument with Γ1 and Γ2 interchanged, proves that Y is an answer set of Γ1 ∪Γ′ if it is an answer set of Γ2 ∪Γ′. Therefore, the answer sets of Γ1 ∪Γ′ and Γ2 ∪ Γ′ coincide for any factual Γ′, i.e., Γ1 and Γ2 are uniformly equivalent.\nExample 3 Reconsider the theories in Example 1. Every non-total HT-interpretation (Xi,L) is an HTcountermodel of Γ1, and thus, each of them is there-closed in Cs(Γ1). On the other hand, none of these HT-interpretations is an HT-countermodel of Γ2. Therefore, Γ1 and Γ2 are not uniformly equivalent.\nCountermodels have the drawback however, that they cannot be characterized directly in HT itself, i.e., as the HT-models of a ‘dual’ theory. The usage of “dual” here is nonstandard compared to its application to particular calculi or consequence relations, but it likewise conveys the idea of a dual concept. In this sense HT therefore is non-dual:\nProposition 1 Given a theory Γ, in general there is no theory Γ′ such that (X,Y ) is an HT-countermodel of Γ iff it is a HT-model of Γ′, for any HT-interpretation (X,Y )."

      "text" : "We now turn to the notion of relativized hyperequivalence. The term ‘hyperequivalence’ has been coined in the context of ASP, as a general expression for different forms of equivalence, which guarantee that the semantics is preserved under the addition of arbitrary programs (called contexts) from a particular class of programs (Truszczynski and Woltran 2008a). Relativized hyperequivalence emanates from the study of relativized notions of equivalence by restricting contexts to particular alphabets (see e.g., (Eiter et al. 2007; Pearce et al. 2007)). It has been generalized to the setting, where possibly different alphabets are used to restrict the head atoms and the body atoms allowed to appear in context rules (Woltran 2008).\nWhile up to now relativized hyperequivalence has only been studied for finite programs, we aim at a generalization of relativized hyperequivalence for propositional theories under the answer-set semantics, without any finiteness restrictions. For this purpose, we first generalize the notions of ‘head atom’ and ‘body atom’ for theories.\nThe occurrence of an atom a in a formula φ is called positive if φ is implication free, if a occurs in the consequent of an implication in φ, or if φ is of the form (φ1 → φ2) → φ3 and a occors in φ1. An occurrence of a is called negative if a occurs in the antecedent of an implication. The notion of positive and negative occurrence is extended to (sub-)formulas in the obvious way. Note that any occurrence under negation therefore is a negative occurrence, and that the occurrence of an atom or subformula may be both positive and negative, for instance the occurrence of b in a → (b → ⊥), viz. a → ¬b.\nA propositional theory Γ over A+ ∪ A−, where A+ and A− are sets of propositional variables, is called an A+-A−-theory if every formula in Γ has positive occurrences of atoms from A+, and negative occurrences of atoms from A−, only. Note that ⊥ is always allowed to appear both, positively and negatively. An A+-A−-theory is called extended, if additionally factual formulas over A+ are permitted.\nBy means of these notions, relativized hyperequivalence for propositional theories can be expressed as follows, which is a proper generalization of the logic programming setting.\nDefinition 7 Two propositional theories Γ1,Γ2 over L are called relativized hyperequivalent wrt. A+ and A−, symbolically Γ1 A + A− ≡ Γ2, iff for any A+-A−-theory Γ over L′ ⊇ L, Γ1 ∪ Γ and Γ2 ∪ Γ are answer-set equivalent.\nTowards a characterization of relativized hyperequivalence, our goal is to follow the same methodology that we used to characterize uniform equivalence, i.e., resorting to HTcountermodels and respective closure conditions. However, while in the logic programming setting such closure conditions may be obtained from certain monotonicity properties of the program reduct, we first have to establish corresponding properties for theories. A first property in this respect is the following. Note that although the next result is stated for extended A+-A−-theories (for reasons which will become clear later), it trivially also holds for any (non-extended) A+-A−-theory.\nProposition 4 Consider an extended propositional A+-A−-theory Γ, and an HT-interpretation (X,Y ). Then, (X,Y ) |= Γ implies (X ′, Y ) |= Γ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− ."

Then, (X,Y ) |= φ implies that φ is not ⊥, and thus is an atom a from A+ such that a ∈ X . Since X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ for all X ′ under consideration, we conclude that a ∈ X ′. Hence, (X ′, Y ) |= φ. Suppose (b) φ is a negative occurrence. If (X,Y ) 6|= φ, then either φ is ⊥, and (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ follows trivially. Otherwise, φ is an atom b from A−, such that b 6∈ X |A− .

This proves (a) and (b) for atomic formulas.\nFor the induction step, assume that (a) and (b) hold for any A+-A−-formula of connective nesting depth n−1, and let φ be a formula of connective nesting depth n. Consider the case where φ is of the form φ1 ∧φ2, respectively φ1 ∨φ2. If φ is a positive occurrence (a), then so are φ1 and φ2, both of connective nesting depth depth n− 1.

This proves (X,Y ) 6|= φ implies (X ′, Y ) |= φ.\nFinally, let φ be of the form φ1 → φ2. Then, independent of whether φ occurs positively or negatively, φ1 is a negative occurrence and φ2 is a positive occurrence, both of connective nesting depth n − 1. First, suppose that φ is a positive occurrence (a), as well as that (X,Y ) |= φ. Towards a contradiction assume that there exists X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ , X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− , and (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ. Since (X,Y ) |= φ implies that Y |= φ, we conclude that both, (X ′, Y ) |= φ1 and (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ2, hold. From the latter, since φ2 is a positive occurrence of connective nesting depth n − 1, it follows that (X,Y ) 6|= φ2 (otherwise by induction hypothesis (a) (X ′, Y ) |= φ2). This implies (X,Y ) 6|= φ1 since (X,Y ) |= φ. However, φ1 is a negative occurrence of connective nesting depth n − 1, thus by induction hypothesis (b) we conclude that (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ1, a contradiction. Therefore, (X ′, Y ) |= φ for all X ′ under consideration, which proves (a). For (b), let φ be a negative occurrence and suppose (X,Y ) 6|= φ. If Y 6|= φ, then also (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ for all X ′ under consideration. In case Y |= φ, we conclude that (X,Y ) |= φ1 and (X,Y ) 6|= φ2. Since φ is a negative occurrence, not only φ1 but also φ2 is a negative occurrence, both of connective nesting depth n − 1. Therefore, by induction hypothesis (b) we conclude that (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ2. Moreover, also because φ is a negative occurrence, φ1 is a positive occurrence as well. Hence, by induction hypothesis (a) we conclude (X ′, Y ) |= φ1 from (X,Y ) |= φ1, viz. (X ′, Y ) 6|= φ, for all X ′ under consideration. This concludes the inductive argument and proves (a) and (b) for A+-A−-formulas of arbitrary connective nesting.\nNext, we turn to factual formulas ψ in Γ, and prove by induction on the formula structure of ψ, that\n(c) (X,Y ) |= ψ implies (X ′, Y ) |= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− ; and (d) (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ implies (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y .\nFor the base case, consider any atomic formulaψ, and suppose first that (c) (X,Y ) |= ψ. Then, ψ is not ⊥, but an atom a from A+ such that a ∈ X . Since X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ for all X ′ such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− , we conclude that a ∈ X ′. Hence, (X ′, Y ) |= ψ. For (d), assume (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ. Then ψ is ⊥ or ψ is a an atom not in Y . In the former case, (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ follows trivially for all X ′ ⊆ Y . In the latter case, the atom also cannot be a member of any X ′ such that X ′ ⊆ Y . Therefore, (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y . This proves (c) and (d) for atomic formulas.\nFor the induction step, assume that (c) and (d) hold for any factual formula of connective nesting depth n−1, and let ψ be a factual formula of connective nesting depth n. Consider the case where ψ is of the form ψ1 ∧ ψ2, respectively ψ1 ∨ ψ2. Since ψ is factual, so are ψ1 and ψ2, both of connective nesting depth depth n − 1.

Assume (d), i.e., (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ. As a consequence, (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ1 or (and) (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ2, hence by induction hypothesis, for all X ′ ⊆ Y , it holds that (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ1 or (and) (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ2. Therefore, (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y .\nFinally, let ψ be of the formψ1 → ⊥. Then,ψ1 is factual and of connective nesting depth depth n − 1. In case (c), if (X,Y ) |= ψ, then Y |= ψ, hence Y 6|= ψ1, i.e., (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ1 and by induction hypothesis (d), the same holds for any (X ′, Y ) such that X ′ ⊆ Y . Thus, in particular for X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− , it follows that (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ1. Moreover, Y |= ψ, and therefore (X ′, Y ) |= ψ → ⊥, for all X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− . For (d), assume (Y, Y ) 6|= ψ. Consequently Y 6|= ψ, and this implies (X ′, Y ) 6|= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y . This concludes the inductive argument and proves (c) and (d) for factual formulas over A+ of arbitrary connective nesting.\nConcerning the claim of the proposition, since (X,Y ) |= Γ implies (X,Y ) |= φ and (X,Y ) |= ψ, for every A+-A−-formula φ in Γ and every factual formula ψ in Γ, we conclude that (X ′, Y ) |= φ and (X ′, Y ) |= ψ, for all X ′ ⊆ Y such that X |A+ ⊆ X ′|A+ and X ′|A− ⊆ X |A− . This proves (X ′, Y ) |= Γ, for all X ′ under consideration.\nComplementary to this result, given a total HT-model of an (extended) A+-A−-theory, we can infer its satisfaction for the following class of non-total HT-interpretations.\nProposition 5 Consider an extended propositionalA+-A−-theoryΓ, and a total HT-interpretation (Y, Y ).

The set of HT-hyperequivalence interpretations wrt. A+ and A− of a propositional theory Γ is denoted by EA +\nA− (Γ).\nThis definition intuitively generalizes the characterization of Woltran (2008) for the logic programming setting to propositional theories. Note however, that rather than resorting to HT-models and a maximality criterion, the above definition refers to equivalence interpretations (i.e., HT-countermodels in case of non-totality) and respective closure conditions. As in the case of uniform equivalence, this not only simplifies the definition, but also avoids difficulties in infinite settings. The next result establishes that HT-hyperequivalence interpretations precisely characterize relativized hyperequivalence.\nTheorem 4 Two propositional theories Γ1,Γ2 are relativized hyperequivalent wrt.

To wit, since (X,Y ) 6∈ EA + A− (Γ2), there exists X ′ ⊂ Y such that X+ ⊆ X ′+, X ′ − ⊆ X−, and (X\n′, Y ) |= Γ2. Moreover, (X ′, Y ) is an HT-model of Γ. Observe that X ′− ⊆ X− implies that (X\n′, Y ) is an HT-model of every formula of the form α → β in Γ. Hence, (X ′, Y ) |= Γ2 ∪ Γ, and since X ′ ⊂ Y , it follows that Y is not an answer set of Γ2 ∪ Γ. Note that Γ is an A+-A−-theory, which contradicts Γ1 A +\nA− ≡ Γ2.\nThis proves EA +\nA− (Γ1) = E\nA+ A− (Γ2).\nFor the if direction, suppose EA +\nA− (Γ1) = E\nA+ A− (Γ2) and towards a contradiction assume\nthat Γ1 A + A− 6≡ Γ2. W.l.o.g. let Y be an answer set of Γ1 ∪ Γ for some A+-A−-theory Γ, such that Y is not an answer set of Γ2∪Γ (the other case is symmetric). Then, (Y, Y ) is an equivalence interpretation of both, Γ1 and Γ, and (Y+, Y ) is closed in Es(Γ1 ∪ Γ), which implies (taking Proposition 5 into account) that (Y, Y ) is A+-total for Γ1 and (Y |A, Y ) is in EA +\nA− (Γ1). Therefore, (Y |A, Y ) is also in EA\n+\nA− (Γ2), with the consequence that (Y, Y ) is\nin Es(Γ2), and thus (Y, Y ) ∈ Es(Γ2 ∪ Γ). Since by assumption Y is not an answer set of Γ2 ∪ Γ, there exists X ⊂ Y such that (X,Y ) 6∈ Es(Γ2 ∪ Γ), i.e., (X,Y ) |= Γ2 ∪ Γ. Since (Y |A, Y ) ∈ EA + A− (Γ2), it holds that X |A ⊂ Y |A. Moreover, X+ ⊂ Y+ due to A+-totality of (Y, Y ). Clearly, (X |A, Y ) is not in EA +\nA− (Γ2) as witnessed by (X,Y ) |= Γ2, and thus\n(X |A, Y ) 6∈ EA + A− (Γ1) since EA + A− (Γ1) = E A+ A− (Γ2). From (X |A, Y ) 6∈ EA + A− (Γ1), we conclude that there exists X ′ ⊆ Y , such that X+ ⊆ X ′+, X ′ − ⊆ X−, and (X\n′, Y ) 6∈ Es(Γ1), i.e., X ′ ⊂ Y and (X ′, Y ) |= Γ1. By Proposition 4, (X,Y ) |= Γ implies (X ′, Y ) |= Γ. Consequently, (X ′, Y ) |= Γ1 ∪ Γ, and since X ′ ⊂ Y , this contradicts our assumption that Y is an answer set of Γ1 ∪ Γ, and proves Γ1 A +\nA− ≡ Γ2.\nLike in the logic programming setting, the framework obtained by the consideration of relativized hyperequivalence interpretations provides a general unified characterization of semantic characterizations of equivalence notions. In other words, the notions of equivalence considered in the previous subsection are obtained as special cases. For this purpose, one needs to refer to the universal alphabet (respectively signature), denoted by A, explicitely. Then, by definition, setting A+ = A− = ∅ amounts to answer-set equivalence, A+ = A− = A yields strong equivalence, and A+ = A, A− = ∅ characterizes uniform equivalence. The latter is not by definition but follows from two simple observations: every set of facts over A is a A-∅-theory, and every A-∅-theory is a factual theory modulo formulas of the form ⊥ → φ, which are tautologies in HT.\nCorollary 2 Given two propositional theories Γ1 and Γ2 over L ⊆ A, the following propositions are equivalent for e ∈ {a, s, u}, A+(a) = A−(a) = ∅, A+(s) = A−(s) = A, A+(u) = A, and A−(u) = ∅:\n(1) Γ1 ≡e Γ2; (2) Γ1 A+(e)\nA−(e)≡ Γ2.\nIn these particular cases, not only the notions of equivalence but also the characteristic semantic structures coincide, i.e., relativized hyperequivalence interpretations coincide with the respective characteristic sets of equivalence interpretations.\nProposition 6 Let Γ be a propositional theory over L ⊆ A, and let e ∈ {a, s, u}, A+(a) = A−(a) = ∅, A+(s) = A−(s) = A, A+(u) = A, and A−(u) = ∅.

The former follows from the first condition in Definition 9 since Y |A+ = ∅, and the latter from the second condition in Definition 9, i.e., from the existence of an X ′ such that X = X ′|A+ (since X ′|∅ = ∅ for any X ′). Note that X = ∅ and (∅, Y ) there-closed in Es(Γ) are exactly the requirements for (X,Y ) ∈ Ea(Γ). This proves (X,Y ) ∈ EA +\nA− (Γ) iff (X,Y ) ∈ Ea(Γ).\nTurning to strong equivalence, let e = s and A+ = A− = A.

Note that (X,Y ) ∈ Es(Γ) implies (Y, Y ) ∈ Es(Γ). Consequently, it holds that (X,Y ) ∈ EA +\nA− (Γ) iff (X,Y ) ∈ Es(Γ).\nEventually consider uniform equivalence, i.e., e = u, A+ = A, and A− = ∅. In this\ncase, (X,Y ) ∈ EA +\nA− (Γ) = E A+(e) A−(e)(Γ), for any HT-interpretation (X,Y ) over A, iff\n(Y, Y ) in Es(Γ) and (X ′, Y ) in Es(Γ) for all X ⊆ X ′′ ⊆ Y .

Note that this are exactly the requirements for (X,Y ) being closed in Es(Γ), thus for (X,Y ) ∈ Eu(Γ). Therefore, (X,Y ) ∈ EA +\nA− (Γ)\niff (X,Y ) ∈ Eu(Γ), which proves the claim.\nMoreover, a setting whereA+ = A− is termed relativized strong equivalence, andA− = ∅ denotes relativized uniform equivalence. A further remark is in place, however. While we proved for uniform equivalence of propositional theories, that it is indifferent to whether we restrict additions (contexts) to sets of atoms or whether we allow for factual theories,A∅-theories syntactically do not encompass factual theories, since negation, i.e., formulas of the form a → ⊥, are not permitted. One question that this raises is: would allowing factual theories as contexts make a difference for relativized notions of uniform equivalence?\nThe answer is by inspection of the proof of Theorem 4 in connection with Proposition 4 and Proposition 5. Recall that the propositions have been stated for extended A+A−-theories. Therefore, the only-if direction of Theorem 4 also holds for extended A+-\nA−-theories. Since the if direction just referred to A+-A−-theories (which, trivially, are extended A+-A−-theories too), we obtain the following.\nCorollary 3 Two propositional theories Γ1,Γ2 are relativized hyperequivalent wrt. extended A+-A−theories if and only if they coincide on their HT-hyperequivalence interpretations wrt. A+ and A−.\nThus, also relativized uniform equivalence is independent of whether sets of atoms or factual theories are permitted as contexts. More generally, for any notion of relativized hyperequivalence, factual theories over A+ can be allowed in the context without altering the notion of equivalence captured. This holds essentially due to Proposition 4, which generalizes Lemma 1 (Lemma 5 in (Pearce and Valverde 2004)) in this respect.\nA final result establishes, that the notion of relativized hyperequivalence which has been introduced in this section is a proper generalization of the respective logic programming version to the more general case of propositional theories under answer-set semantics. It is a straight forward consequence of Theorem 4, since the A+-A−-theories in the proof of the if direction consist of formulas corresponding to rules with heads restricted to positive atoms from A+ and body atoms from A−. Let us say that two propositional programs Π1 and Π2 are relativized hyperequivalent wrt. A+ and A− in the logic programming sense, in symbols Π1 A +\nA− ≡ lp Π2, if and only if Π1 ∪ Π ≡a Π2 ∪Π for any program Π, such that\nH−(r) = ∅, H+(r) ⊆ A+, and B(r) ⊆ A−, for all r ∈ Π.\nCorollary 4 Given two programs Π1 and Π2, let A+ and A− be sets of propositional variables. Then, Π1 A+ A− ≡ lp Π2 if and only if Π1 A + A− ≡ Π2."

In this section we study first-order theories.\nAs first-order theories we consider sets of sentences (closed formulas) of a first-order signature L = 〈F ,P〉 in the sense of classical first-order logic. Hence, F and P are pairwise disjoint sets of function symbols and predicate symbols with an associated arity, respectively. Elements of F with arity 0 are called object constants. A 0-ary predicate symbol is a propositional constant. Formulas are constructed as usual and variable-free formulas or theories are called ground.

It is characterized by Kripke models of two worlds with a common universe (hence static) that interpret function symbols in the same way.\nMore formally, consider a first-order interpretation I of a first-order signature L on a universe U . We denote by LI the extension of L obtained by adding pairwise distinct names cε as object constants for the objects in the universe, i.e., for each ε ∈ U . We write CU for the set {cε | ε ∈ U} and identify I with its extension to LI given by I(cε) = ε.

If φ is of the form p(t1, . . . , tn), then p(ctI\n1 , . . . , ctIn) ∈ J because M |= φ. By the fact\nthat J ′ ⊇ J we conclude that p(ctI 1 , . . . , ctIn) ∈ J ′ and hence M ′ |= φ. If φ is of the form t1 = t2 then M |= φ implies tI1 = t I 2, and thus M\n′ |= φ. Note also that M |= φ implies φ 6= ⊥. This proves the claim for atomic formulas.\nFor the induction step, assume that M |= φ implies M ′ |= φ, for any sentence of depth n−1, and let φ be a sentence of depth n. We show that M |= φ implies M ′ |= φ. Suppose φ is the conjunction or disjunction of two sentences φ1 and φ2. Then φ1 and φ2 are sentences of depth n − 1. Hence, M |= φ1 implies M ′ |= φ1, and the same for φ2. Therefore, if M models both or one of the sentences then so does M ′, which implies M |= φ implies M ′ |= φ if φ is the conjunction or disjunction of two sentences. As for implication, since φ is factual we just need to consider the case where φ is of the form φ1 → ⊥, i.e., ¬φ1. Then, M |= ¬φ1 iff 〈I,K〉 |= ¬φ1 iff M ′ |= ¬φ1. This proves M |= φ implies M ′ |= φ if φ is an implication with ⊥ as its consequence. Eventually, consider a quantified sentence φ, i.e., φ is of the form ∀xφ1(x) or ∃xφ1(x). In this case, M |= φ implies M |= φ1(cε) and 〈I,K〉 |= φ1(cε), for all ε ∈ U , respectively M |= φ1(cε), for some ε ∈ U , in case of existential quantification. Since each of the sentences φ1(cε) is of depth n − 1, the same is true for M ′ by assumption, i.e., M ′ |= φ1(cε) and 〈I,K〉 |= φ1(cε), for all ε ∈ U , respectively M ′ |= φ1(cε), for some ε ∈ U . It follows that M |= φ implies M ′ |= φ also for quantified sentences φ of depth n, and therefore, for any sentence φ of depth n. This proves the claim.\nThe different notions of closure naturally extend to (sets of) QHT-interpretations. In particular, a total QHT-interpretation M = 〈I,K,K〉 is called total-closed in a set S of QHT-interpretations if 〈I, J,K〉 ∈ S for every J ⊆ K . A QHT-interpretation 〈I, J,K〉 is closed in a set S of QHT-interpretations if 〈I, J ′,K〉 ∈ S for every J ⊆ J ′ ⊆ K , and it is there-closed in S if 〈I,K,K〉 6∈ S and 〈I, J ′,K〉 ∈ S for every J ⊆ J ′ ⊂ K .\nThe first main result lifts the characterization of uniform equivalence for theories by HT-countermodels to the first-order case.\nTheorem 5\nTwo first-order theories are uniformly equivalent iff they have the same sets of there-closed QHT-countermodels.\nThe proof idea is the same as in the propositional case, thus for space reasons the proof is skipped. The same applies to Theorem 6 and Proposition 7 (cf. (Fink 2009) for full proofs).\nWe next turn to an alternative characterization by a mixture of QHT-models and QHTcountermodels as in the propositional case. A QHT-countermodel 〈I, J,K〉 of a theory Γ is called QHT here-countermodel of Γ if 〈I,K〉 |= Γ. A QHT-interpretation 〈I, J,K〉 is an QHT equivalence-interpretation of a theory Γ, if it is a total QHT-model of Γ or a QHT here-countermodel of Γ. In slight abuse of notation, we reuse the notation Se, S ∈ {C,E} and e ∈ {c, a, s, u}, for respective sets of QHT-interpretations, and arrive at the following formal result:\nTheorem 6 Two theories coincide on their QHT-countermodels iff they have the same QHT equivalenceinterpretations, in symbols Cs(Γ1) = Cs(Γ2) iff Es(Γ1) = Es(Γ2).\nAs a consequence of these two main results, we obtain an elegant, unified formal characterization of the different notions of equivalence for first-order theories under generalized answer-set semantics.\nCorollary 5 Given two first-order theories Γ1 and Γ2, the following propositions are equivalent for e ∈ {c, a, s, u}: Γ1 ≡e Γ2; Ce(Γ1) = Ce(Γ2); Ee(Γ1) = Ee(Γ2).\nMoreover, lifting the characterization of HT-countermodels provided in Proposition 2 to the first-order setting, allows us to prove a property, which simplifies the treatment of extended signatures.\nProposition 7 Let M be a QHT-interpretation over L on U . Then, M ∈ Es(Γ) for a theory Γ iff M |= Γφ(M) for some φ ∈ Γ, where Γφ(M) = {¬¬ψ | ψ ∈ Γ} ∪ {φ → (¬¬a → a) | a ∈ BP,CU}.\nFor QHT-models it is known that M |= Γ implies M |L |= Γ (cf. e.g., Proposition 3 in (de Bruijn et al. 2007)), hence M |L 6|= Γ implies M 6|= Γ, i.e., M |L ∈ Cs(Γ) implies M ∈ Cs(Γ). The converse direction holds for totality preserving restrictions (the proof appeared in (Fink 2008) and can also be found in (Fink 2009)):\nTheorem 7 Let Γ be a theory over L, let L′ ⊃ L, and let M a QHT-interpretation over L′ such that M |L is totality preserving. Then, M ∈ Cs(Γ) implies M |L ∈ Cs(Γ).\nNote that this property carries over to QHT-models, i.e., M |L |= Γ implies M |= Γ, if M |L is the restriction of M to L and this restriction is totality preserving. Otherwise, by the above result M 6|= Γ would imply M |L 6|= Γ. We remark that in (Fink 2008) it is erroneously stated informally that this property does not hold for QHT-models, however the counter-example given there is flawed (Example 5 in (Fink 2008))."

The latter, is a further case to be considered in the inductive argument, however one that reduces easily to the respective induction hypotheses.

For a proper treatment of these issues, further background is required and introduced (succinctly, but at sufficient detail) below.\nIn non-ground logic programming, we restrict to a function-free first-order signature L = 〈F ,P〉 (i.e., F contains object constants only) without equality. A program Π (over L) is a set of rules (over L) of the form (1). A rule r is safe if each variable occurring in H(r) ∪ B−(r) also occurs in B+(r); a rule r is ground, if all atoms occurring in it are ground. A program is safe, respectively ground, if all of its rules enjoy this property.\nGiven Π over L and a universe U , let LU be the extension of L as before. The grounding of Π wrt. U and an interpretation I|LF of LF on U is defined as the set grdU (Π, I|LF ) of ground rules obtained from r ∈ Π by (i) replacing any constant c in r by cε such that I|LF (c) = ε, and (ii) all possible substitutions of elements in CU for the variables in r.\nAdapted from (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1991), the reduct of a program Π with respect to a first-order interpretation I = 〈I|LF , I|CU 〉 on universe U , in symbols grdU (Π, I|LF )\nI , is given by the set of rules\na1 ∨ · · · ∨ ak ← b1, . . . , bm,\nobtained from rules in grdU(Π, I|LF ) of the form (1), such that I |= ai for all k < i ≤ l and I 6|= bj for all m < j ≤ n.\nA first-order interpretation I satisfies a rule r, I |= r, iff I |= Γr, where Γr = ∀~x(βr → αr), ~x are the free variables in r, αr is the disjunction of H(r), and βr is the conjunction of B(r). It satisfies a program Π, symbolically I |= Π, iff it satisfies every r ∈ Π, i.e., if I |= ΓΠ, where ΓΠ = ⋃ r∈Π Γr.\nA first-order interpretation I is called a generalized answer set of Π iff it satisfies grdU(Π, I|LF )\nI and it is subset minimal among the interpretations of L on U with this property.\nTraditionally, only Herbrand interpretations are considered as the answer sets of a logic program. The set of all (object) constants occurring in Π is called the Herbrand universe of Π, symbolically H. If no constant appears in Π, then H = {c}, for an arbitrary constant c. A Herbrand interpretation is any interpretation I of LH = 〈H,P〉 on H interpreting object constants by identity, id , i.e., I(c) = id(c) = c for all c ∈ H. A Herbrand interpretation I is an ordinary answer set of Π iff it is subset minimal among the interpretations of LH on H satisfying grdH(Π, id)\nI . Furthermore, an extended Herbrand interpretation is an interpretation of L on U ⊇ F interpreting object constants by identity. An extended Herbrand interpretation I is an open answer set (Heymans et al. 2007) of Π iff it is subset minimal among the interpretations of L on U satisfying grdU (Π, id)\nI . Note that since we consider programs without equality, we semantically resort to the logic QHTs, which results from QHTs= by dropping the axioms for equality. Concerning Kripke models, however, in slight abuse of notation, we reuse QHT-models as defined for the general case. A QHT-interpretation M = 〈I, J,K〉 is called an (extended) QHT Herbrand interpretation, if 〈I,K〉 is an (extended) Herbrand interpretation. Given a program Π, 〈I,K〉 is a generalized answer set of Π iff 〈I,K,K〉 is a QEL-model of ΓΠ, and 〈I,K〉 is an open, respectively ordinary, answer set of Π iff 〈I,K,K〉 is an extended Herbrand, respectively Herbrand, QEL-model of ΓΠ. Notice that the static interpretation of constants introduced by Item (i) of the grounding process is essential for this correspondences in terms of QHTs. Abusing notation, we further on identify Π and ΓΠ.\nAs already mentioned for propositional programs, uniform equivalence is usually understood wrt. sets of ground facts (i.e., ground atoms). Obviously, uniform equivalence wrt. factual theories implies uniform equivalence wrt. ground atoms. We show the converse direction (lifting Theorem 2 in (Pearce and Valverde 2004), for a proof see (Fink 2009)).\nProposition 10\nGiven two programs Π1,Π2, then Π1 ≡u Π2 iff (Π1 ∪ A) ≡a (Π2 ∪ A), for any set of ground atoms A.\nThus, there is no difference whether we consider uniform equivalence wrt. sets of ground facts or factual theories. Since one can also consider sets of clauses, i.e. disjunctions of atomic formulas and their negations, which is a more suitable representation of facts according to the definition of program rules in this article, we adopt the following terminology. A rule r is called a fact if B(r) = ∅, and a factual program is a set of facts. Then, by our result Π1 ≡u Π2 holds for programs Π1,Π2 iff (Π1 ∪Π) ≡a (Π2 ∪Π), for any factual program Π."

      "text" : "The results in the previous section generalize the notion of uniform equivalence to programs under generalized open answer-set semantics and provide alternative characterizations for other notions of equivalence. They apply to programs under open answer-set semantics and ordinary answer-set semantics, when QHT-interpretations are restricted to extended Herbrand interpretations and Herbrand interpretations, respectively. In order to capture strong and uniform equivalence under ordinary answer-set semantics correctly, interpretations under the Standard Name Assumption (SNA) have to be considered, accounting for the potential extensions. For programs Π1 and Π2 and e ∈ {c, a, s, u}, we use Π1 ≡Ee Π2 and Π1 ≡ H e Π2 to denote (classical, answer-set, strong, or uniform) equivalence under open answer-set semantics and ordinary answer-set semantics, respectively.\nCorollary 7 Given two programs Π1 and Π2, it holds that\n• Π1 ≡Ee Π2, C E e (Π1) = C E e (Π2), and E E e (Π1) = E E e (Π2) are equivalent; and • Π1 ≡He Π2, C H e (Π1) = C H e (Π2), and E H e (Π1) = E H e (Π2) are equivalent;\nwhere e ∈ {c, a, s, u}, superscript E denotes the restriction to extended Herbrand interpretations, and superscriptH denotes the restriction to Herbrand interpretations for e ∈ {c, a}, respectively to SNA interpretations for e ∈ {s, u}.\nFor safe programs open answer sets and ordinary answer sets coincide (de Bruijn et al. 2007). Note that a fact is safe if it is ground. We obtain that uniform equivalence coincides under the two semantics even for programs that are not safe. Intuitively, the potential addition of arbitrary facts accounts for the difference in the semantics since it requires to consider larger domains than the Herbrand universe.5\nTheorem 9 Let Π1,Π2 be programs over L. Then, Π1 ≡Eu Π2 iff Π1 ≡ H u Π2."

Let Π be a factual program such that M = 〈id ,K,K〉 is an extended Herbrand QHT-interpretation over L′ ⊇ L on U ′, such that M is in EEa (Π1 ∪Π), but M 6∈ EEa (Π2 ∪ Π). Consider the signature LU ′ = 〈U ′,L′P ∪ {d}〉, where L ′ P are the predicate symbols of L′, and d 6∈ L′P is a fresh unary predicate symbol. Clearly, LU ′ ⊃ L ′. Furthermore let Π′1 = Π1 ∪Π∪ {d(X)}, Π ′ 2 = Π2 ∪Π∪ {d(X)}, and K ′ = K ∪ {d(c) | c ∈ U ′}. We show that M ′ = 〈id ,K ′,K ′〉 is in EHa (Π ′ 1), but M ′ 6∈ EHa (Π ′ 2). Since M |= Π1 ∪ Π and no sentence in Π1 ∪ Π involves d, we conclude M ′ |= Π1 ∪ Π. By construction, M ′ is also a QHT-model of d(X), hence M ′ |= Π′1. Moreover, 〈id , J,K〉 6|= Π1∪Π, for every J ⊂ K . Therefore, for every J ′ = J ∪{d(c) | c ∈ U ′} such that J ⊂ K , 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 6|= Π′1. So let us consider proper subsets J\n′ of K ′ such that K ⊆ J , i.e., J ′ ⊂ {d(c) | c ∈ U ′}. In this case 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 6|= d(X), and again 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 6|= Π′1. This proves that M ′ is in EHa (Π ′ 1). On the other hand, if M 6|= Π2∪Π, then M 6|= Π2, and since\n5 Note that this also holds for QHTs= with functions and the result could be strengthened accordingly.\nno sentence in Π2 involves d, we concludeM ′ 6|= Π2, thus M ′ 6|= Π′2. If M |= Π2∪Π, then 〈id , J,K〉 |= Π2 ∪Π for some J ⊂ K . Consider J ′ = J ∪ {d(c) | c ∈ U ′}. Since J ⊂ K , it holds that J ′ ⊂ K ′, and since no sentence in Π2 ∪Π involves d, 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 |= Π2 ∪Π. Moroever, 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 |= {d(X)} by construction, hence 〈id , J ′,K ′〉 |= Π′2. This proves M ′ 6∈ EHa (Π ′ 2). Note that Π ∪ {d(X)} is a factual program; contradiction.\nFinally, we turn to the practically relevant setting of finite, possibly unsafe, programs under Herbrand interpretations, i.e., ordinary (and open) answer-set semantics. For finite programs, uniform equivalence can be characterized by HT-models of the grounding, also for infinite domains. In other words, the problems of “infinite chains” as in Example 1 cannot be generated by the process of grounding. Note that the restriction to finite programs also applies to the programs considered to be potentially added.\nTheorem 10 Let Π1,Π2 be finite programs over L. Then, Π1 ≡Hu Π2 iff Π1 and Π2 have the same (i) total and (ii) maximal, non-total extended Herbrand QHT-models."

This means that Π1 and Π2 have (i) the same total extended Herbrand QHT-models, as well as the same sets of closed extended Herbrand QHT equivalence interpretations, and thus (ii) the same maximal, non-total extended Herbrand QHT-models.\nFor the if direction, assume that Π1 and Π2 have the same total and the same maximal, non-total extended Herbrand QHT-models but, towards a contradiction, that Π1 6≡Hu Π2. Then, there exists a finite factual program Π, such that (Π1∪Π) 6≡Ha (Π2∪Π). W.l.o.g. let M = 〈I,K,K〉 over L′ ⊇ L be in EHa (Π1 ∪Π) and M 6∈ E H a (Π2 ∪Π). Let H denote the Herbrand universe of Π1 ∪ Π. Since Π1 and Π are finite, H is finite and so is grdH(Π1 ∪ Π, id). Therefore, by minimality, K is finite as well. Note also, that M is a total extended Herbrand QHT-model of Π1. By hypothesis (i), Π1 and Π2 have the same total extended Herbrand QHT-models. Thus, M is also a total extended Herbrand QHT-model of Π2. Moreover, there exists a QHT-interpretation M ′ = 〈I, J,K〉, such that J ⊂ K and M ′ |= (Π2∪Π), hence M ′ |= Π2. Since K is finite, we conclude that Π2 has a maximal, non-total QHT-model M ′′ = 〈I, J ′′,K〉, such that J ′ ⊆ J ′′ ⊂ K . We show that this is not the case for Π1. M ′ |= (Π2 ∪ Π) implies M ′ |= Π. Since Π is a factual program, by Lemma 3 we conclude that M ′′ |= Π. However M ′′ 6|= Π1 ∪ Π, because M ∈ EHa (Π1 ∪ Π). Taken together,M ′′ |= Π andM ′′ 6|= Π1∪Π implies M ′′ 6|= Π1. Therefore,M ′′ is not a maximal, non-total QHT-model of Π1. Observing that M ′′ is an Herbrand QHT-model over L′ and L′ ⊇ L, we conclude that M ′′ is a maximal non-total extended Herbrand QHT-model of Π2, but not of Π1. Contradiction."

      "text" : "Countermodels in equilibrium logic have recently been used by Cabalar and Ferraris (2007) to show that propositional disjunctive logic programs with negation in the head are strongly equivalent to propositional theories, and by Cabalar et al. (2007) to generate a minimal logic program for a given propositional theory.\nBy means of QEL, in (Lifschitz et al. 2007), the notion of strong equivalence has been extended to first-order theories with equality, under the generalized notion of answer set we have adopted. QEL has also been shown to capture open answer-sets (Heymans et al. 2007) and generalized open answer-sets (Heymans et al. 2008), and is a promising framework for hybrid knowledge bases, providing a unified semantics encompassing classical logic as well as disjunctive logic programs under the answer-set semantics (de Bruijn et al. 2007).\nOur results extend these foundations for the research of semantic properties in these generalized settings. First, they complete the picture concerning the prominent notions of equivalence by making uniform equivalence amenable to these generalized settings without any finiteness restrictions, in particular on the domain. In addition, the developed notion of relativized hyperequivalence interpretation provides a means for the study of more specific semantic relationships under generalized answer-set semantics. Thus, a general and uniform model-theoretic framework is achieved for the characterization of various notions of equivalence studied in ASP. We have also shown that for finite programs, i.e., those programs solvers are able to deal with, infinite domains do not cause the problems observed for infinite propositional programs, when dealing with uniform equivalence in terms of HT-models of the grounding.\nAn intersting theoretical problem for further work is to consider equivalences and correspondence under projections of answer sets (Eiter et al. 2005; Oetsch et al. 2007; Pührer et al. 2008; Pührer and Tompits 2009). It is not difficult to apply existing techniques to our characterizations in order to obtain characterizations for projective versions of uniform and strong equivalence, and for relativized notions thereof, i.e., as long as the same alphabet is permitted for positive and negative occurrences in the context. However, it is not trivial to characterize projective versions of relativized hyperequivalence in the general case, something which also has not been considered for propositional logic programs so far.\nConcerning the application of our results, there is ongoing work on combining ontologies and nonmonotonic rules, an important issue in knowledge representation and reasoning for the Semantic Web. The study of equivalences and correspondences under an appropriate (unifying) semantics, such as the generalizations of answer-set semantics characterized by QEL, constitute a highly relevant topic for research in this application domain (Fink and Pearce 2009). Like for Datalog, uniform equivalence may serve investigations on query equivalence and query containment in these hybrid settings, and due to the combination of two formalisms, more specific notions of equivalence are needed to obtain the intended notions of correspondence. While our characterizations serve as a basis for these investigations, in particular the simplified treatment of extended signatures for (equivalence) interpretations is expected to be of avail, when considering separate alphabets.\nOn the foundational level, our results raise the interesting question whether extensions of intuitionistic logics that allow for a direct characterization of countermodels, or equivalence interpretations, would provide a more suitable formal apparatus for the study of (at least notions of uniform) equivalences in ASP."

    "abstractText" : "Different notions of equivalence, such as the prominent notions of strong and uniform equivalence, have been studied in Answer-Set Programming, mainly for the purpose of identifying programs that can serve as substitutes without altering the semantics, for instance in program optimization. Such semantic comparisons are usually characterized by various selections of models in the logic of Hereand-There (HT). For uniform equivalence however, correct characterizations in terms of HT-models can only be obtained for finite theories, respectively programs. In this article, we show that a selection of countermodels in HT captures uniform equivalence also for infinite theories. This result is turned into coherent characterizations of the different notions of equivalence by countermodels, as well as by a mixture of HT-models and countermodels (so-called equivalence interpretations). Moreover, we generalize the so-called notion of relativized hyperequivalence for programs to propositional theories, and apply the same methodology in order to obtain a semantic characterization which is amenable to infinite settings. This allows for a lifting of the results to first-order theories under a very general semantics given in terms of a quantified version of HT. We thus obtain a general framework for the study of various notions of equivalence for theories under answer-set semantics. Moreover, we prove an expedient property that allows for a simplified treatment of extended signatures, and provide further results for non-ground logic programs. In particular, uniform equivalence coincides under open and ordinary answer-set semantics, and for finite non-ground programs under these semantics, also the usual characterization of uniform equivalence in terms of maximal and total HT-models of the grounding is correct, even for infinite domains, when corresponding ground programs are infinite.
