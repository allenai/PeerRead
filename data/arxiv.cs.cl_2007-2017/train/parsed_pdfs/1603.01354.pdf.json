      "text" : "Linguistic sequence labeling, such as part-ofspeech (POS) tagging and named entity recognition (NER), is one of the first stages in deep language understanding and its importance has been well recognized in the natural language processing community. Natural language processing (NLP) systems, like syntactic parsing (Nivre and Scholz, 2004; McDonald et al., 2005; Koo and Collins, 2010; Ma and Zhao, 2012; Chen and Manning, 2014) and entity coreference resolution (Ng, 2010), are becoming more sophisticated, in part because of utilizing output information of POS tagging or NER systems.\nMost traditional high performance sequence labeling models are linear statistical models, including Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Passos et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2015), which rely heavily on hand-crafted features and taskspecific resources. For example, English POS taggers benefit from carefully designed word spelling features; orthographic features and external resources such as gazetteers are widely used in NER. However, these task-specific knowledge are costly to develop, making sequence labeling models difficult to adapt to new tasks or new domains.\nIn the past few years, non-linear neural networks with as input distributed word representations, also known as word embeddings, has been broadly applied to NLP problems and achieve great success. Collobert et al. (2011) proposed a simple but effective feed-forward neutral network that independently classifies labels for each word by using contexts within a window with fixed size. Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Goller and Kuchler, 1996), together with its variants such as long-short term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Gers et al., 2000) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), have shown great success in modeling sequential data. Several RNNbased neural network models have been proposed to solve sequence labeling tasks like speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013), POS tagging (Huang et al., 2015) and NER (Chiu and Nichols, 2015), achieving competitive performance against traditional models. However, even systems that have utilized distributed representations as inputs have used these to augment, rather than replace, handcrafted features (e.g. features about word spelling and capitalization patterns). The performance drops rapidly when the models solely depend on neural embeddings. ar X iv :1 60 3. 01 35 4v 1 [ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nM ar\n2 01\n6\nIn this paper, we propose a neural network architecture for sequence labeling. It is a truly endto-end model requiring no task-specific resources, feature engineering, or data pre-processing beyond pre-trained word embeddings on unlabeled corpora. Thus, our model can be easily applied to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks on different languages and domains. We first use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al., 1989) to encode character-level information of a word into its character-level representation. Then we combine character- and word-level representations and feed them into bi-directional LSTM (BLSTM) to model context information of each word. On top of BLSTM, we use a sequential CRF to jointly decode labels for the whole sentence. We evaluate our model on two linguistic sequence labeling task — POS tagging on Penn Treebank WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993), and NER on English data from CoNLL 2003 shared task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). Our end-to-end model outperforms previous stateof-the-art systems, obtaining 97.55% accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21% F1 for NER. The contributions of this work are (i) proposing a novel neural network architecture for linguistic sequence labeling. (ii) giving empirical evaluations of this model on benchmark data sets for two classic NLP tasks. (iii) achieving state-of-the-art performance with this truly end-to-end system."

Though, in theory, RNNs are capable to capturing long dependencies, in practice, they fail due to the gradient varnishing/exploding problems (Bengio et al., 1994; Pascanu et al., 2012).\nLSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) are a variant of RNNs designed to cope with the gradient varnishing problems inherent in RNNs. Basically, a LSTM unit is composed of three multiplicative gates which control the proportions of information to forget and pass into next time step. Figure 2 gives the basic structure of a LSTM unit.\nFormally, the formulas to update a LSTM unit\nat time t are:\nit = σ(W iht−1 +U ixt + bi) ft = σ(W fht−1 +U fxt + bf ) c̃t = tanh(W cht−1 +U cxt + bc) ct = ft ct−1 + it c̃t ot = σ(W oht−1 +U oxt + bo) ht = ot tanh(ct)\nwhere σ is the element-wise sigmoid function and is the element-wise product. xt is the input vector (e.g. word embedding) at time t, and ht is the hidden state (also called output) vector storing all the useful information at (and before) time t.

      "text" : "For sequence labeling (or general structured prediction) tasks, it is beneficial to consider the correlations between labels in neighborhoods and jointly decode the best chain of labels for a given input sentence. For example, in POS tagging an adjective is more likely to be followed by a noun than a verb, and in NER with standard BIO2 annotation (Tjong Kim Sang and Veenstra, 1999) I-ORG cannot follow I-PER. Therefore, we model label sequence jointly using a conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001), instead of decoding each label independently.\nFormally, we use z = {z1, · · · , zn} to represent a generic input sequence where zi is the input\nvector of the ith word. y = {y1, · · · , yn} represents a generic sequence of labels for z. Y(z) denotes the set of possible label sequences for z. The probabilistic model for sequence CRF defines a family of conditional probability p(y|z;W,b) over all possible label sequence y given z with the following form:\np(y|z;W,b) =\nn∏ i=1\nψi(yi−1, yi, z)∑ y′∈Y(z) n∏ i=1 ψi(y′i−1, y ′ i, z)\nwhere ψi(y′, y, z) = exp(WTy′,yzi + by′,y) are potential functions, and WTy′,y and by′,y are the weight vector and bias corresponding to label pair (y′, y), respectively.\nFor CRF training, we use the maximum conditional likelihood estimation. For a training set {(zi,yi)}, the logarithm of the likelihood (a.k.a. the log-likelihood) is given by:\nL(W,b) = ∑ i log p(y|z;W,b)\nMaximum likelihood training chooses parameters such that the log-likelihood L(W,b) is maximized.\nDecoding is to search for the label sequence y∗\nwith the highest conditional probability:\ny∗ = argmax y∈Y(z) p(y|z;W,b)\nFor a sequence CRF model (only interactions between two successive labels are considered), training and decoding can be solved efficiently by adopting the Viterbi algorithm (Lafferty et al., 2001)."

We choose an initial learning rate of η0 (η0 = 0.01 for POS tagging, and 0.015 for NER, see Section 3.3.), and the learning rate is updated on each epoch of training as ηt = η0/(1+ ρt), with decay rate ρ = 0.05 and t is the number of epoch completed. To reduce the effects of “gradient exploding”, we use a gradient clipping of 5.0 (Pascanu et al., 2012). We explored other more sophisticated optimization algorithms such as AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012), Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) or RMSProp (Dauphin et al., 2015), none of them meaningfully improve upon SGD with momentum and gradient clipping in our preliminary experiments.

The “best” parameters appear at around 50 epochs, according to our experiments. Fine Tuning. For each of the embeddings, we fine-tune initial embeddings, modifying the embeddings during gradient updates of the neural network model by back-propagating gradients. The effectiveness of this method has been previously explored in sequential and structured prediction problems (Collobert et al., 2011; Peng and Dredze, 2015). Dropout Training. To mitigate overfitting, we apply dropout method (Srivastava et al., 2014) to regularize our model. As shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3, we apply dropout layers on character embeddings before inputting to CNN, and on both the input and output vectors of BLSTM. We fix dropout rate at 0.5 for all dropout layers through all the experiments. We obtain significant improvements on model performance after using dropout (see Section 4.5)."

Note that the final hyper-parameters for these two tasks are almost the same, except the initial learning rate. We set the state size of LSTM to 200.

First, they did not employ CNNs to model character-level information. Second, they combined their neural network model with hand-crafted features to improve their performance, making their model not an end-to-end system. Chiu and Nichols (2015) proposed a hybrid of bi-directional LSTM and CNNs to model both character- and word-level representations, which is similar to the first two layers in our model. They evaluated their model on NER task and achieved competitive performance. Our model mainly differ from this model by using CRF for joint decoding. Moreover, their model is not truly end-to-end, either, because they utilized external knowledge such as character-type, capitalization and lexicon features, and some data pre-processing specifically for NER (e.g. replacing all sequences of digits 0-9 with a single “0”)\nThere are several other neural networks previously proposed for sequence labeling. Labeau et al. (2015) proposed a RNN-CNNs model for German POS tagging. This model is similar to the LSTM-CNNs model in Chiu and Nichols (2015), with the difference of using vanila RNN instead of LSTM. Another neural architecture employing CNN to model character-level information is the “CharWNN” architecture (Santos and Zadrozny, 2014) which is inspired by the feed-forward network (Collobert et al., 2011).

On top of BLSTM, we use a sequential CRF to jointly decode the sequence of labels for the given sentence. It is a truly end-to-end model relying on no task-specific resources, feature engineering or data pre-processing. Experimental results on two linguistic sequence label tasks — POS tagging and NER — demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. We achieved state-of-theart performance on both the two tasks, comparing with previously state-of-the-art systems which are highly-engineered with hand-crafted features, data pre-processing and external resources.\nThere are several potential directions for future work. First, our model can be further improved by exploring multi-task learning approaches to combine more useful and correlated information. For example, we can jointly train a neural network model with both the POS and NER tags to improve the intermediate representations learned in our network. Another interesting direction is to apply our model to data from other domains such as social media, twitter and weibo. Since our model does not require any domain or task specific knowledge, it might be promising to apply our model to these domains painlessly."

Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data preprocessing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks on different languages. We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks — Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER). We obtain stateof-the-art performance on both the two data — 97.55% accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21% F1 for NER.",
