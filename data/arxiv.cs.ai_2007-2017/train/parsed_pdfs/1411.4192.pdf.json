      "text" : "Copyright © 2014 Glenn R. Hofford.\nRepresentation is a cross-discipline topic that includes knowledge representation from the field of artificial intelligence, meaning representation from the field of natural language understanding, and structured information from information processing. The field of logic is replete with methods for representation and reasoning. In the areas of AI knowledge representation and reasoning, leading approaches include first order logic, description logic, lambda calculus, semantic networks, framebased approaches and many others. Meaning representation techniques from the field of natural language understanding include the above in addition to approaches like conceptual dependency.\nROSS (“Representation, Ontology, Structure, Star”) is introduced as a new method for representation that emphasizes representational constructs for physical structure. The ROSS approach starts with a normal form that is self-consciously less-expressive than logic, and builds from the bottom-up to achieve the expressiveness that is needed for a domain. Information that uses the normal form exists within an analogical frame of reference. What is achieved is a greater degree of structure in the representations that use ROSS when compared with representations that are typically created using formal approaches such as FOL. The ROSS normal form involves a set of modeling guidelines and underlying ontological commitments that involve naive or intuitionistic assumptions.\nROSS can be used in several ways: it is a representational method for knowledge bases that contain class definitions; it is a method for representational artifacts that contain fact-like constructs; and, it provides a foundation for representations that support various forms of inference. The first two uses are described and a brief introduction to how ROSS supports reasoning techniques is presented. The principles of ROSS have been used to create an expert system for diagnosis and a proof of concept natural language understanding system for story comprehension; these principles are briefly described."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "ROSS is introduced as a representational approach that contains unique features that assist with a number of important representation objectives. ROSS is an acronym composed of the initial letters from the words “Representation”, “Ontology”, “Structure”, and “Star language”. The Star language is also introduced in this paper. ROSS provides an infrastructure and a set of implicit guidelines that help with the following tasks:\n Creation of knowledge bases that have well-organized entity and behavior clas-\nses.\n Generation of representation artifacts (containing instances of classes) that are\nhighly structured based on the use of a normal form for spatial/temporal location-related attributes.\nROSS accomplishes two things that relate to the use of the term “structure”; the distinction between these two aspects is as follows:\n It represents the physical structure of a problem domain or domain of discourse\nin a way that is rich and deep. How this is specifically done is explained.\n The representational knowledge base or fact artifact itself is highly structured.\nTwo specific methods are presented: Star language definition documents and an XML-based format for instance models. (An instance model is a meaning representation artifact that is generated by the semantic processing of a natural language understanding program).\nIt will be shown that these two features of\nROSS are complementary with each other.\nROSS is also a representational platform for a variety of techniques for automated inference. The set of ROSS features for inference is briefly introduced."

      "heading" : "1.1 Context Within Information Processing,",
      "text" : "AI and NLP\nThe field of information processing requires methods that support and facilitate structured storage (via key-based indexing), that in turn supports query and analysis. The DBMS field has well-established conventions and methods for these tasks. ROSS is useful for creating structured information artifacts that go beyond DBMS in the complexity of the subject matter or problem domain.\nThe field of symbol-based AI knowledge representation and reasoning requires techniques that allow automation of inference in its various forms. Formal methods for knowledge representation are necessary to facilitate reasoning. Knowledge representation artifacts can be classified with respect to the types of information they represent: artifacts that include abstract definitions, e.g. of classes, and rule-like constructs are referred to as knowledge bases or rule bases. Artifacts that include fact-like constructs, whether these are past facts, goals, plans, predicted states or other fact-like items are referred to herein as fact repositories or transcripts.\nIn the field of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU), a meaning representation is a cohesive representational artifact that is the output of a process of natural language understanding or comprehension as this process is applied to a sentence, fragment, or document of human natural language text. Existing meaning representation approaches include first order logics, semantic networks, and frame-based approaches (Jurafsky and Martin, 2009). Other approaches include lambda calculus, description logic and conceptual graphs. The main objective of such natural language understanding meaning representation techniques and languages is that of representing the original information in a structured way – this enables further NLP objectives that include tasks as varied as summarization, named entity recognition, and relationship detection. Question answering systems require the transformation of questions into a structured form. NLU can also benefit from structured meaning representations that are a platform for inference about semantics and context: this allows for enrichment of the parsing and semantic processing steps. Semantic processing within NLU also involves the use of knowledge bases that contain classes of entities and behaviors; ROSS provides an infrastructure for this requirement.\nROSS is a representational method that is physical symbol-based 1 . Generally speaking it is based on the tenets of the Knowledge Representation Hypothesis 2 . Knowledge (definitions, facts, rules, etc.) is represented declaratively rather than procedurally. ROSS can be used as a representation and reasoning technique that assists human cognition, and, it is capable of automation. As a method that can be automated, it provides a representational infrastructure that allows for effective inference in an independent mechanistic manner."

      "heading" : "1.2 Ontological Basis",
      "text" : "The ontology of ROSS is an “operational ontology” that has been worked out for the purpose of representation. ROSS starts with a seemingly simple ontological concept and works out the implications and details consistently. The concept addresses the question “for the purpose of constructing structured representational knowledge bases and artifacts, what exists in the physical or external world, that is, the world (whether real or hypothetical) that is represented?” The answer is: unit-sized location entities 3 that do not move; these entities exist within a four-dimensional (4D) world that can be understood as consisting of Euclidean space with the added dimension of time. Cartesian coordinates are used with the important restriction that dimensions are only represented using integers, not real numbers (this restriction is necessitated by the requirement of indivisibility and is explained in the section on the ontology of ROSS). The ontological foundations thus share similarities with those of the fields of naive physics and commonsense representation and reasoning 4 .\nThe ontological concept involves the idea that a unit-sized location entity is an entity that has both spatial size and temporal duration. The representation of other entities, aspects, or characteristics of the represented world from the universe of discourse is accomplished using a variety of representational constructs for aggregation\n1 Cf. Newell and Simon (1976) for a general definition of a physical symbol system. 2 The Knowledge Representation Hypothesis is described in Smith (1982). 3 The term “entity” is used somewhat imprecisely throughout this paper – in general it refers to a fixed location in space and time. The difference between “entity” and “object” will be explained in what follows. 4 Cf. Mueller (2006) - the discrete event calculus as an example of an integer-based system.\nor composition. For instance, larger entities are represented using a mechanism for the specification of structure within a hierarchy, and motion is broken down into a sequence of states, each of which is represented using attributes that specify the static features of a single-time-point entity.\nThe ontology of ROSS consists of these and several other ontological constraints and requirements, which collectively provide a basis for the creation of a set of knowledge base definitions. In the area of NLU for instance, these definitions can be used to assist or support the (human or automated) task of the creation of fact transcripts, or instance models that represent the subject matter of natural language textual input."

      "heading" : "1.3 Epistemology",
      "text" : "ROSS in its current form does not directly address the epistemological (i.e. belief-related) aspects of representation. This is primarily due to the emphasis that is placed on the structural aspects of representation. An implicit assumption is involved wherein a ROSS fact repository is an artifact that represents a set of true facts about a situation (the degree of belief involves full certainty). Where a situation involves agents that themselves represent and communicate information, the agents’ mental states and the communicative aspects are represented using the same fundamental approach that is used for representing entities and aspects of commonsense domains. (However, ROSS does have features for representation that involves a high level of abstraction; these features are well-suited for representations of representation, information, mental states, communication, etc.)."

      "heading" : "1.4 Is ROSS a Logic?",
      "text" : "ROSS is a method that fits the definition of “representational scheme” (Hayes, 1974). ROSS has a set of syntactic rules and semantics that are based on a set of ontological assumptions and on an ontological framework that builds on these assumptions. ROSS shares many features with representational schemes that are referred to as “logics” such as first order logic and description logic. ROSS provides a foundation for reasoning, or inference; however, unlike most logics, the techniques for reasoning that use ROSS are loosely coupled with the representational system of ROSS. This loose coupling allows ROSS to support a wide range of methods for inference. However, some of the normally expected elements for a logic are not currently present in ROSS, such as a set of axioms; therefore the\nterm “representational scheme”, rather than “logic”, has been deemed as appropriate for ROSS.\nPractitioners who are familiar with using logic for the tasks that are addressed by ROSS may find that the concepts of ROSS seem somewhat cumbersome. ROSS is a paradigm shift from logic, and using it requires additional effort in some areas such as the tasks of modeling to create supporting definitions and to create intricate classes. In addition, ROSS imposes stringent restrictions on the modeling task; these may at first seem unnecessary. This paper attempts to show the benefits that result from the effort that is required by the technique."

      "heading" : "1.5 Comprehensiveness of Representation",
      "text" : "A requirement for all structured representation approaches is that of comprehensiveness or completeness – the meaning representation language or logic must be capable of full coverage of the information for a problem domain or from a domain of discourse (for NLU, this is the domain of the information represented by the input natural language text). ROSS provides a framework that allows for comprehensive representation, both in knowledge bases and in fact-related artifacts.\nA sometimes-overlooked or misunderstood objective for a representation is that of organization. It is often mistakenly assumed that the way to achieve highly structured representational artifacts involves using highly refined, elegant and concise techniques (e.g. FOL, lambda calculus). These approaches are appropriate for some domains, such as the task of representing numerical concepts and computational processes. However what has been overlooked is that a method may be highly formalized and mathematically precise, yet at the same time it may be weak for practical use for domains and representational uses outside the scope to which it has been applied. In contrast, the premise of ROSS is that a large field of domains has a rich structure that is readily organized in ways that have not been accomplished with other techniques. 5"

ROSS definitional constructs (attribute value sets, attribute types, classes, etc.) are somewhat elaborate. The goal of representation with ROSS is a high level of organization, not necessarily conciseness of its definitions and expressions. The task of modeling in order to create a set of classes and instances that are appropriately comprehensive and complex - even for some seemingly-simple assertions - necessitates a rich, complex and sophisticated representational approach. 6"

      "heading" : "1.7 Background",
      "text" : "Throughout the 60-plus years of their respective histories, the fields of AI knowledge representation and reasoning and NLP natural language understanding have involved quests for representational methods that are capable of representing problem domains or the subject matter from domains of discourse in ways that are suitably rich and deep. A deep representation would be one that is comprehensive and that adequately captures the structure of the represented domain. The AI tasks of knowledge representation and commonsense reasoning have been addressed by practitioners using symbolic approaches as early as the 1960s and 1970s. This work flourished during that period and extended into the 1980s, but symbolic approaches ran into difficulties and did not achieve the successes that had been anticipated.\nAn example is the SHRDLU system of Terry Winograd, which focused on commonsense reasoning about simple domains and questionanswering (Winograd, 1971).\nWithin the field of natural language understanding, (Sowa, 2006) describes the shift that took place during the 1980’s on the part of Terry Winograd and others:\n6 Nash (2013): a blog post entitled “Make Things As Simple As Possible, But Not Simpler” emphasizes the danger of oversimplification in technology. ROSS is aligned with the premise of the so-called Einstein’s Razor: “It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.” (courtesy: http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein) This can be summarized as “Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler.” Contrast with Occam’s Razor: “plurality must never be posited without necessity”, which may in some cases be used as a justification for oversimplification.\nTerry Winograd, for example, called his first book Understanding Natural Language (1972) and his second book Language as a Cognitive Process: Volume I, Syntax (1983). But he abandoned the projected second volume on semantics when he realized that no existing semantic theory could explain how anyone, human or computer, could understand language. With his third book, coauthored with the philosopher Fernando Flores, Winograd (1986) switched to his later work on the design of human-computer interfaces. Winograd’s shift in priorities is typical of much of the AI research over the past twenty years. Instead of language understanding, many people have turned to the simpler problems of text mining, information retrieval, and designing user interfaces.\nThe ambitious systems of the 1970s and 1980s were viewed either as overly-complex, cumbersome, and overly domain-specific. Some of these projects perhaps raised more questions than they answered. Subsequently, particularly in the NLP field, statistical approaches came to the fore and have tended to dominate the landscape.\nThe question of why the symbolic approaches failed - or only achieved partial success - has continued to perplex those who believe that important answers are yet to be discovered that involve symbolic approaches. The author’s view is that the ROSS approach provides a foundational set of principles and a representational scheme that contain important answers to these questions."

      "heading" : "1.8 Comparisons",
      "text" : "This paper compares ROSS against first order logic (FOL) and description logic; a few comparisons are also made against frames. In contrast to FOL, ROSS is based upon a set of explicit assumptions about the nature of the reality that is represented (the represented world) in order to achieve a greater degree of organization than is typically achieved using FOL. ROSS also includes important modeling restrictions that constrain the task of creating definitions that model the world or domain.\nIn contrast to description logic, ROSS is not built on a syllogistic categorical approach. ROSS classes are not representations of sets, a ROSS class is a mechanism for storing information about instances that get instantiated. Inheritance is optional in ROSS.\nROSS shares some similarities with frames 7 , but it has a much more elaborate infrastructure than frames for representing physical structure. For readers who are accustomed to the frames terminology, a ROSS attribute type is the rough equivalent of a frame slot, and a ROSS attribute value is the rough equivalent of a frame filler."

      "heading" : "2.1 The Physical Structure of the Domain is Richly Represented",
      "text" : "Can traditional logic represent the complex physical structure of a person? The answer in theory is yes; however in practice traditional logics provide little in the way of guidelines for accomplishing representational tasks like this. For instance, given a hypothetical “person” class, how is the set of spatial relationships between the overall person and the sub-parts (components) such as person head and person body represented? How is physical size represented?\nThe representation of part to sub-part (“PartOf”) relationships is a foundational and well-studied task within AI knowledge representation 8 . A number of AI representational schemes, including frames and KL-ONE do represent physical structure and the PartOf relationship. However these techniques are limited 9 . In order to facilitate completeness of representation, firstly, a representational scheme should support the following features; these go well beyond predication of the existence of a “PartOf” relationship:\n attributes that can specify the location of a component part in relation to its parent ob-\nject.\n attributes that can specify the spatial orientation of a component in relation to its\nparent object.\n attributes that can specify the physical dimensions of a component (its size, or ex-\ntent) using a coordinate scheme that is defined in terms of its parent object.\n7 Minsky (1981) originated the frame concept; Minsky (1986) contains further elaborations on frames. 8 Sometimes referred to as mereology. 9 Minsky (1981), Brachman and Schmolze (1985)\nSecondly, this should be done in a way that is flexible, so that when instances get instantiated based on an entity class, they are created with a basic structure, but only the specifics that are known are specified."

      "heading" : "2.1.1 Object Frame Class",
      "text" : "ROSS introduces two important representational constructs that handle structure. The first of these is called the object frame class. 10 An object frame class represents a specific physical location within a four-dimensional space-time frame of reference. The object frame class is a class that is used for the creation of object frame instances: an object frame instance is simply a location that is fixed in space and time. (Note: an object frame class is sometimes referred to as a “location entity” class – these terms are synonymous). An object frame class or instance can be (spatially) “unit-sized” or “aggregate”. An aggregate object frame instance is somewhat analogous to a rectangular wire frame. (The upcoming Ontology section describes the background of these concepts in greater detail)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1.2 Dimension System",
      "text" : "The second representational construct is called the dimension system type, or dimension system. A dimension system is a group of closely-related dimensions. A dimension, or dimensional attribute, is like a single coordinate within a coordinate system such as the Cartesian coordinate system (e.g. the value of an x coordinate is a dimension). A dimension system includes a set of such attributes that must be used together in expressions that specify the location of a physical object. Dimension systems are used within object frame classes to provide a way of specifying locational 11 attributes of embedded component object frame classes. The component object frame class uses a special “RelationshipToParent” section, in which the dimension system items are used in order to specify the location and orientation of the component in relation to the parent, and in order to specify the dimensions (size or extent) of the component.\nFigure 1 shows the structure of the ROSS object frame class that represents the structure of a\n10\n“Frame” here is not equivalent to the AI frames; in\nthe context of “object frame class”, it denotes a structural aspect. 11\nThe term “locational” is used by the author to refer\nto the location aspects of an entity; these can be spatial or temporal aspects.\nperson, called “PersonObjectFrameClass”. Note that the detail for each of the two dimension systems of the PersonObjectFrameClass is not shown.\nThe diagram provides an overview of how an object frame class represents structure. Because this is a class, the actual attribute values for a number of items are not filled in: they are designated as “nil”. When an instance is instantiated from the class, if specification information is available it will be used to fill in these values.\nObject frame classes and dimension systems facilitate the creation of representations that rep-\nresent dimensional structure. This dimensional structure is usually defined by the use of spatial and temporal dimensions; however other nonspecific dimensional attributes can be used, such as enumerated values. An example would be a dimension system that has a locational attribute with values of PersonHeadReceptacle and PersonBodyReceptacle. (A receptacle is an attribute value that designates a location that is distinct from other receptacles that are part of the enumerated list).\nThis approach provides an infrastructure for what is referred to as “primary information”:\npropositional information that is tied into a frame of reference. This eliminates the need for a multiplicity of assertions that represents not only essential (qualitative) facts but the relational “place” of the objects of those facts (such as is typically done with FOL). (As will be seen, relationships between location entities are handled by ROSS; such relational information is part of the category of secondary or derivative information)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Definitions of classes",
      "text" : "Besides class definition statements that define object frame classes (aka “entity classes”) ROSS contains other definitional constructs such as attribute types, attribute value sets, dimension systems and behavior classes. These are rich, sophisticated definitions that provide context for propositional expressions which are used in specific representations. Consequently, the instances that are instantiated from the object frame classes have a rich set of structural, attributive, relational and behavioral attributes.\nROSS classes can be compared to those of the\ndescription logics, where the concept can 12 represent a class. Description logics provide a way to define a unary predicate (concept) in terms of constituent features. Like description logic classes, ROSS classes can contain attributive and relational information (e.g. the class of gold coins has the attribute of having gold material composition). However ROSS classes also represent “type” information involving dimension systems (i.e. dimension system “types”), attribute types and relationship types. In addition, structural information in a ROSS object frame class can be viewed as “type” information), and object frame classes have lists of associated potential behaviors; this is another form of type information.\nIn contrast to some representational schemes and logics, a ROSS class is not equivalent to a mathematical set. A ROSS class is a mechanism for the aggregation of features.\nFigure 2 is an overview of the supporting definitions and of the main class types in a ROSS knowledge base:\n12\nBaader, et al.: “The vocabulary consists of con-\ncepts, which denote sets of individuals …”"

      "heading" : "2.3 Inheritance",
      "text" : "The most basic form of ROSS does not mandate any form of inheritance. The process of instantiation of an instance of a locational entity (either by a human using the ROSS approach or in an automated system) may involve the use of a class, but it is not necessary for this class to exist within a hierarchical inheritance structure. The minimal requirement for such a class that is used for instantiation of instances is that it contains dimension system information and a reference to a universal structural parent 13 ."

      "heading" : "2.4 Grounding",
      "text" : "The definitional classes of ROSS provide an important part of an answer to the symbol grounding problem 14 . In the field of natural language understanding, a related perspective was provided by Fillmore (1982). In his introduction to semantic frames, he states “By the term ‘frame’ I have in mind any system of concepts related in such a way that to understand any one of them you have to understand the whole structure in which it fits; when one of the things in such a structure is introduced into a text, or into a con-\n13\nA structural parent class is an object frame class\nthat is used for placement of other smaller embedded objects frame classes. The embedded object frame classes are usually not actual structural parts. The structural parent serves as a frame of reference. 14\nHarnad (1990) described the symbol grounding\nproblem as the task of mapping symbols to aspects of the external world.\nversation, all of the others are automatically made available”. The definitions of ROSS provide this kind of infrastructure, so that when instantiation takes place, symbols have reference to more complex symbol-based constructs (the definitional classes).\n2.5 Granularity: “Grain Size”\nROSS is flexible with respect to the definitions that are used. Definitions are represented declaratively and thus an entire set of definitions is interchangeable with other similar such sets of definitions. The creation of a set of ROSS definitions starts with selection of one or more grain sizes (these are chosen per each class, or, where inheritance is used, the grain size can be defined for a higher-level base class). The grain sizes that are chosen for the base classes must be finegrained enough to accommodate the information that is anticipated. For instance, a set of definitions that is used for news stories about events in the “everyday world” would require one set of grain sizes, whereas news stories about developments in the field of physics would require another set of grain sizes. (A single ROSS knowledge base can however accommodate all such needs if the higher level classes use appropriately-small grain sizes)."

Primary information is information that is specified in a way that is normalized with respect to a spatial/temporal frame of reference. It can be said to be “canonical” 15 . It is entity-centric, not relationship-centric. There are many types of secondary information, and ROSS subdivides these using a stratification scheme.\nAn example of secondary information is the relationship between two locational entities within a frame of reference. A specific example of a relationship within a transcript about past facts would be an expression that specifies that the\n15\nWoods (1975) (III.B The Canonical Form Myth)\nargues that canonical forms are not likely to be possible, (and are not necessarily desirable). The author’s view is as follows: 1) for knowledge base definitional information: ROSS class representations are partly analogical; object frame classes do make use of primary information, in particular by the use of class attributes which can use shape templates, and 2) for fact repository artifacts: a canonical form is possible but it is constrained by the availability of primary information.\nspatial distance at some specified point in time between Person1 and Person2 is 3 feet. (In contrast, the primary information about Person1 consists of attributes that specify its location in relation to a structural parent class).\nPrimary (canonical form/normal form) information can exist within an object frame class or within a fact repository artifact."

For example, a group of FOL expressions about a situation from a blocks world might mix together several distinct types of facts:\nƎx:Block(x) – the predicate is a category\nƎx:CompositionIsWood(x)\n- predicate is an attribute about the\ninternal structure or composition\nƎx,Ǝy:OnTopOf(x, y)\n- predicate is a relational attribute\nIn contrast the ROSS approach handles each of these cases in a different way. A ROSS artifact containing such facts would conform to normal form. In the examples shown here, for the first case, ROSS uses a class that has been fully and precisely defined in a definitions section of a knowledge base; in the second case, the assertion as expressed in ROSS would exist within a larger representational construct (primary information in normal form) that specifies not only the internal composition but also the location-related attributes of the object; in the third case the OnTopOf relationship would exist as part of a relationship construct that is handled as secondary information.\nNormal form provides a unified way to represent information, with the result that ROSS knowledge bases and fact-based artifacts are non-redundant and complete – insofar as primary information is available. In some applications (e.g. NLU) where secondary information such as relationships is prevalent ROSS provides infrastructure that allows for storage of the secondary\n16\nFor the sake of argument, neither the epistemologi-\ncal aspect (degree of belief or of certainty about the fact) nor the degree of truth (as in fuzzy logic) are considered here.\ninformation in a way that is consistently integrated with the primary information."

Mental computational processes that are performed by humans are represented in a similar way; automated computational processes are also represented. Representations in ROSS of human or automated representations or computational processes are typically ones that utilize more-abstract physical spatial coordinates or spatial location dimensions. For example, to represent the fact that an intelligent agent has a cognitive representational concept that represents “vehicles”, it may be sufficient to describe the physical location of this concept as existing in the agent’s memory and that it is spatially distinct from other related concepts.

These modeling restrictions and requirements are essential for producing knowledge base and fact artifact representations that are structured. The ontology is restrictive for a purpose: traditional upper ontologies that involve a taxonomic tree of objects with “thing”, “substance”, (or some variation thereof) at the root are not viewed as relevant for the purpose of organizing the represented world as it is addressed by ROSS.\nThe study of the “categories” has a long tradition in philosophy – on that predates Aristotle. Aristotle described an upper ontology in his Categories. Tree-like ontologies have been predominant ever since and are still prevalent.\nRussell (1945) was a critic of Aristotle’s tax-\nonomy; he provides an interesting perspective:\n“I do not myself believe that the term “category” is in any way useful in philosophy, as representing any clear idea. There are, in Aristotle, ten categories: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and affectation… There is no suggestion of any principle on which the list of ten categories has been compiled. …\nI conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned in this chapter are\nwholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant”.\nRegarding the basis for a set of categories, the question of “what exists” has been addressed throughout the history of philosophy. The influential work of Quine (1948) acknowledges two kinds of existence: physical things, like the continent of Australia, and abstract things – e.g. prime numbers.\nIn contrast to the approaches that have been described, the ROSS approach is not based on a tree-like taxonomy at all. If a taxonomy of “things” (“what exists”) were drawn, ROSS would only have one entity at the root, the unitsized location entity.\nBecause the ROSS ontology is itself a representational tool, many philosophical questions simply are not addressed – it is intended as an ontological framework that has been integrated with a representational methodology. The ROSS ontology is a sort of “pseudo-ontology”: it is the basis for a representational framework that is useful for a broad range of domains.\nAdherence to the ROSS ontological conventions facilitates modeling practices that ultimately result in definitions and expressions that are internally consistent, unambiguous, and nonredundant. These conventions apply to the modeling of the universe of discourse or a domain of discourse or problem domain. The ontological constraints are as follows."

Movable objects must be represented as an aggregation of unit-size objects. Likewise, anything else – entities, motion, state changes, etc. - that is represented using ROSS must build on the fundamental building block of the unit-sized location entity. 19\nAn implication of this constraint for ROSS representation is that unit-sized location entities are the only thing that can be existentially quanti-\n19\nThe unit-size location entity does have a single unit of duration in time.

As will be seen, other representations can be used in place of integers, such as enumerated values or string values.\nAn example of a fixed location with a specific value at a specific point in time involves the digits of the national debt clock (any particular digit) in New York City. The concept of a fixed location with a specific value at a specific point in time in ROSS can be seen as a generalization of this and many other instances.

This requirement results in representations that contain infrastructure that allows all entities to be correlated with each other within a central frame of reference. A dimension system can be very abstract, as is the case where specifics of a location do not need to be represented. Or, a dimension system can be very specific, for instance, it can be the implementation of a four-dimensional coordinate system with x, y, z, and t coordinates.\nWhy is the dimension system required for ROSS? The requirement for the existence of a dimension system is the foundation for an entire set of representational constructs that represent structure. A dimension system provides a frame of reference for all entities that are described. 20\n20\nNote that ROSS also contains the relationship\nconstruct (as secondary information) that is useful for representing specific relationships between two entities.

This can be visualized as a rectangular shaped region (a cube or rectangular right prism (a cuboid)). It is a collection, or aggregation of unit-sized location entity instances. Because this frame of reference exists, there is not a need for the use of the existential quantifier - as would be the case with FOL – for propositional ROSS expressions.

The Greek word atomai means “unsplittable” and was used to describe the smallest existent particles - these particles were hypothesized as being solid, hard and indestructible. The modern physics concept of atom is more specific due to better detection devices (not to mention the body of analytic and empirical methods of modern science) – an atom is precisely defined with respect to its attributes, such as size and mass.\nThe ROSS approach borrows one aspect from Greek atomism: the unit-sized location entity of ROSS is indivisible. Indivisibility of ROSS atoms is necessary so that value set values can be used as descriptors. If a ROSS unit-sized location entity were divisible, a new set of attribute value sets would need to be created – one for each of the newly-created components.\nlarger parking lot using structural relationship-toparent attributes, but at the same time their explicit spatial relationship to each other may be represented in order to capture the meaning of the phrase “the woman stood near the car”. 21\nCf. Sowa (2000) - Aristotle’s concept of monads (units), specifically his idea of point and instant are somewhat similar to atoms.\nA key difference is that the ROSS “atom” comes into existence, last for only one time interval, and cannot be said to exist again. It has – at the least - a numeric value. Insofar as the value can vary from one “atom” to the next, the ROSS concept in this respect also differs from that of the early Greeks and from the physics atom, since both concepts involve a uniformity of all atoms.\nThe comparison between ROSS unit-sized entities and atoms from the field of physics breaks down with respect to specificity. Since ROSS is only a representational scheme, it does not involve any implicit claim that a unit-sized location entity actually exists. This allows for complete flexibility in modeling, as an atomic size may be chosen that is capable of representation for a problem domain or for a wide range of problem domains."

The process of instantiation uses the class and its shape pattern to create an instance: this process must specify specific spatial dimensions and therefore it involves a computational task called magnification, using the shape pattern in order to infuse the instance with a set of NotSpace values that correspond to the original NotSpace values of the ShapePattern.\n A telescopic dimension system mapping is used in order to accomplish the magnifica-\ntion of a shape pattern to generate an instance pattern for the shape.

A key distinction is that Hayes appears to preserve the concept of objects that exist through time whereas ROSS does not permit this.\nJohnston (2011) provides an overview of the objectives and architecture of the Comirit Objects project, a system that represents and reasons about things in the physical world. The knowledge representation approach centers around the voxel, which is defined as “the 3- dimensional equivalent of a pixel: it refers to a small cubic region in 3D space.” Further definition is provided “Voxels are the 3D equivalent of bit-mapped or raster images.” The use of voxels for representation of physical objects is as follows “Instead of representing an object by a complex polygonal structure, its shape can be approximated by a set of voxels that fill a similar space.” The voxel concept shares a basic similarity with the ROSS unit-sized location entity. Whereas the characteristic of color can be attributed to a voxel, ROSS‘s implementation of the unit-sized location entity – the object frame class – is capable of association with any attribute that can be conceptualized (e.g. material composition, texture, mass).

For use in generating an instance model, the typical case involves using an object frame class (an entity class), such as CarObjectFrameClass, which class either may contain all information, or it may rely on higher classes to contribute some of its features. The alternate case involves using a more-abstract object frame class referred to as ObjectObjectFrameClass. This class is abstract with the exception of dimension system information and a reference to a universal structural parent. For example, an NLU instance model may contain an instance that has been instantiated based on ObjectObjectFrameClass. Since the structural parent is known it can be inserted into the model.

The location attributes describe where an entity is in space and time. When these defini-\ntions are used in generating or creating an instance model, type checking can and should be performed to ensure that each attribute type is used (in an instance model or fact transcript construct called the “dimension set expression”) – this provides for representation expressions that conform to the ROSS requirements for the specification of structure."

This feature is especially important for natural language story understanding because human dialog is often imprecise with respect to place and time.\nThe ability to translate or map between different dimension systems is viewed as a key feature of ROSS; it is a reflection of how human memory and cognition work. Humans seem to have a general-purpose three-dimensional frame of reference that underlies (perhaps all) representations. The capability for representing the location of things in the physical world often involves smaller “customized” frames of reference. An example would be a mental representation that a particular house is at 1000 State Street, in some city. The custom frame of reference has a dimension system that consists of city identification (name), street name and street number.

For instance, the logic assertion “E(x): Blue(x)” (which can be read “there exists an object such that the object is blue”), makes use of a predicate that actually corresponds to a Star attribute value, not the attribute type name. Attribute values do not provide a good basis for indexability since they may be members of very large sets. In contrast attribute types are more appropriate as criteria for indexing as it is needed to support queries of structured information.\nROSS attributes are not limited to containing constant values: an attribute value may consist of a value range, a math expression, or a function name that refers to a function that has been defined within the ROSS knowledge base.

A two-part attribute cluster can exist within a class definition in a knowledge base or it may exist within a fact repository artifact. The Star language implementation of the two-part attribute cluster is a representational construct that consists of at least one attribute from the attribute super-type called “location attribute types”, and at least one attribute from the attribute super-type called “value attribute types”. 24 The rationale behind this requirement is that it produces ROSS expressions that fully describe entities from the represented world. (The XML implementation of a two-part attribute cluster, e.g. in an NLU instance model, is not shown here).\nThe two-part attribute cluster is the equivalent of a set of propositions or assertions in logic; where these assertions would include one or more propositions that represent the location of an entity and one or more propositions that represent the value of the same entity.\nThe following is an example of a two-part attribute cluster. (The Star language fragment also\n24\nStar includes a somewhat-skeletal taxonomy of\nattribute types that has two main categories at the top of the tree; these are referred to as “attribute supertypes”: they are the category of location attribute types and the category of value (qualitative) attribute types.\nshows several preliminary definitions, followed by an attachment statement wherein an object frame instance is instantiated).

      "heading" : "4.18 Feature: Representation of Abstract Entities",
      "text" : "ROSS can handle the representation of abstractions that involve entities that have physical attributes that are not relevant to a given domain. Examples of abstract entities can be found in many domains. From the legal realm these include the law suit, tort, jurisdiction, legal action and will. Examples from the area of finance include income, expense and revenue. The areas of human cognitive concepts and mental processes, human emotions and natural language communication include many others. It can be argued that other abstractions include the physics concepts of force, energy and potential.\nThe underlying perspective is that all entities – whether they are perceived and conceptualized as “concrete” or abstract are in fact concrete to the extent that they can be rooted in a spatial/temporal frame of reference. The Platonic form or ideal is not allowed existence in ROSS representations since all such supposed forms (e.g. a circle) only actually exist as concepts.\nRepresentation of abstract entities involves grounding of such entities in a physical spatial/temporal frame of reference (for instance, within an NLU instance model, the frame of reference is a structural parent object frame instance). Two approaches are possible: the first approach involves the use of dimension systems\n25\nHofford 2013 the U.S. patent “Expert System and\nmethod” introduced the binder concept.\nthat are skeletal (for instance, those that have less detail than a 3D Cartesian coordinate system). An example would be a dimension system that describes legal jurisdiction using an enumerated list of jurisdictional regions rather than morespecific geographical coordinates. The second approach happens during the assimilation of abstract entities into a structural parent frame of reference when they are instantiated in an instance model; during the attachment process they are imprecisely situated via the use of attribute value ranges.\nAn example involves the representation of revenue and is accomplished as follows. An instance of revenue (e.g. a sale of some item in a particular store) has at least some component in a four-dimensional space-time reality, but the coordinate system that is needed to describe it should be appropriate to the needs of the representation. This requires the use of a dimension system that has enumerated values that indicate time and place values. Secondly, the necessary attribute values are less-descriptive than those for physically concrete domains. For instance, the time at which a particular sales transaction took place may be specified as within the range of the business hours of the store where it was sold (e.g. TimeOfSale = range (9:00am – 6:00pm)). The exact place is not needed, and therefore a general place can be specified (e.g. PlaceOfSale = “MainStreetStore-399”).\nIn many cases, an abstract entity is not one, but in fact an aggregation of multiple entities that exist at disparate places and times – a law suit would fit in this category. A ROSS fact repository can accommodate this type of aggregate entity – for instance an NLU instance model would contain specifications of various objects, processes, features, etc. of a law suit, using the standard set of ROSS primitives. However, entities that are involved in the law suit are also described as having attributes that are based on the fact that the humans that are involved have conceptualizations about such entities. E.g. the process of the initial filing of the law suit is performed (physically) by a person or persons, but it is also “known” by various persons as being a process that involves physical entities that are part of the larger abstraction of the law suit.\nEntity classes that are defined primarily by their behavior are handled by the representational mechanism of the ROSS behavior class. In many situations, the spatial/temporal specifics are of minor importance relative to some essential functionality. An example is the abstraction\nof the physical harm cause that might be said to exist in relation to instances of a person class (this would be any thing – person or animal, falling rock, etc. that has a potential behavior involving “causes harm to a person”). A ROSS entity class would be defined (PhysicalHarmCausalAgent) that has a structural parent that is identical to the one used by a threatened persons class. In a fact repository (e.g. NLU instance model) an instantiated instance of PhysicalHarmCausalAgent is an object frame instance that exists at a point on a timeline, having a set of spatial relationship attributes in relation to the harmed person."

It must be noted that an object frame class does not actually have behaviors – it only has a list of potential behaviors. An object frame instance does not have behaviors at all: it only implements states of a behavior at some point along a timeline. For example, within an NLU instance model, each single-time-point object frame instance participates in behaviors via attributes that specify its state. An aggregate object frame instance (at a single time point) can thus participate in multiple behaviors simultaneously due to its having multiple attributes, each of which represent some aspect of its state."

Since knowledge engineering has long been recognized as a bottleneck for AI, automated approaches are viewed as highly valuable. The following are several broad categories of automated knowledge\nacquisition to learn classes and class features from natural language text:\n Intermediate-depth approaches that learn features based on associations. E.g. (unsu-\npervised) learning that cars can be blue based on sentences that associate “blue” with “car”.\n Learning new sub-classes and their behaviors based on simple sentences of the form\n“an x is a y that does z”. (E.g. “an electrician is a person who fixes electrical problems”).\n Deeper approaches that learn structure, features and behaviors from NL descrip-\ntions that explicitly describe structure and features. (E.g. a “simple encyclopedia” entry on “automobile”).\nThe Ontology derivation task is not limited to natural language-based approaches. Other possibilities include the use of interactive tools that such as those that would allow human users to draw objects.

      "heading" : "10 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In comparison with logic and other AI representational schemes, the essence of the ROSS approach centers on its ontological restrictions, or restrictions for modeling. This ontological framework is rooted in a naïve view that uses discreteness of space and time as a basis. The benefits are very substantial in how it enables modeling and representations that are very rich and that are appropriate in semantic complexity for the comprehensive and well-organized representation of domains. The ROSS ontological restrictions and commitments provide a set of guidelines for the task of knowledge base creation and refinement. Furthermore, these restrictions facilitate the creation of fact representations that are highly structured, unambiguous and non-redundant. The ROSS framework for representing physical structure – using dimension systems, the structural features of the object\nframe class, and the structural parent instance concept - is beneficial for providing a frame of reference that provides an organizing infrastructure for the representation of relational attributes (the normal form). ROSS instance representations are implicitly hybrid, combining an analogical approach with a symbolic approach. The analogical aspect is present due to the use of a structural parent instance (as it houses a base/master dimension system). When this is used as a foundation for ROSS normal form information (e.g. instantiations of shape templates), the resultant fact instance representations provide for query (as against structured information) and are a platform for inference.\nThe ROSS approach to class hierarchies is bottom-up rather than top-down. The instantiation process that uses classes to create instances (e.g. in NLU instance models) starts from the perspective of assuming too little, not too much. For instance, during the NLU semantic processing phase, few details may be known about an instance of a class represented by a term in the input text; therefore ROSS starts with fewer assumptions about its class instance features, structure and attributes.\nSecondary information can be derived from primary information and stored in the same fact repository. ROSS normal form provides a foundation; the infrastructure (e.g. of an instance model) is flexible so that additional information such as relationships can be stored in the same artifact. Derived information such as collections also fits into the same representational artifact.\nThe richness of the ROSS approach has implications for the representation of commonsense knowledge – this has value for areas such as NLU story comprehension."

The field of logic is replete with methods for representation and reasoning. In the areas of AI knowledge representation and reasoning, leading approaches include first order logic, description logic, lambda calculus, semantic networks, framebased approaches and many others. Meaning representation techniques from the field of natural language understanding include the above in addition to approaches like conceptual dependency. ROSS (“Representation, Ontology, Structure, Star”) is introduced as a new method for representation that emphasizes representational constructs for physical structure. The ROSS approach starts with a normal form that is self-consciously less-expressive than logic, and builds from the bottom-up to achieve the expressiveness that is needed for a domain. Information that uses the normal form exists within an analogical frame of reference. What is achieved is a greater degree of structure in the representations that use ROSS when compared with representations that are typically created using formal approaches such as FOL. The ROSS normal form involves a set of modeling guidelines and underlying ontological commitments that involve naive or intuitionistic",
