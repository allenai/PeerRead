      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Interaction is an action that occurs between two entities that may share similar functions or metabolic pathways [4, 43, 52]. Various interactions exist, such as protein-protein [15, 24, 49], compoundprotein [59], RNA-RNA including miRNA-mRNA [26, 34, 68, 69], and chemical-chemical interactions (CCI) [32].\nCCI is an interaction that occurs between chemicals. e following CCI-related studies have been conducted: a study on compound synergism that predicts the therapeutic e cacy of molecule combinations, based on interactive chemicals [67]; toxicity related studies\n∗To whom correspondence should be addressed.\non predicting chemical toxicities and side e ects based on the assumption that interacting chemicals are more likely to share a similar toxicity [6, 7]; targeted candidate drug discovery studies through which the new closest candidate drug to the commercialized target drug was proposed by connecting the interacting chemicals in the graphical aspects [8]; and a study in which a novel approach was developed for identifying biological functions of chemicals, based on the assumption that interactive chemicals participate in the same metabolic pathways [22]. As evidenced by the range of studies mentioned above, CCI has been used for many purposes. However, no method exists to learn CCI. Instead, CCI is created from text mining, biological experiments, chemical-chemical similarities, and other information from chemical databases. We therefore propose a learning-based CCI prediction method.\ne conventional learning-based chemical (drug) analyses can be divided into two stages, feature engineering and predicting activity, as shown in Figure 1. In drug analyses, features are also called descriptors, ngerprints, or molecular representations.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 43\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 A\npr 2\n01 7\ne feature engineering stage extracts informative features from chemicals. A signi cant amount of information has been manually designed by domain experts, ranging from simple counts (e.g., the number of atoms, rings, and bonds) to topological properties (e.g., atom pairs, shapes, and connectivities) [60]. Extracted features have been used in subsequent analyses and signi cantly a ected prediction performance. Various works have been proposed to capture the essential properties of chemicals, and more than 5,000 diverse features have been identi ed [60] (e.g., PubChem, MACCS, and CDK ngerprint).\ne predicting activity stage uncovers the relationship between the extracted features and biological activities, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) [58, 61]. To robustly learn relationships between chemicals and activities, and to handle a large amount of data, machine learning approaches (such as support vector machine (SVM) [10, 13] and random forest (RF) [56]) have been successfully applied.\nRecently, the deep learning method has notably advanced to address challenging problems, such as natural language processing [3, 39, 55], speech and image recognition [12, 18, 20, 31, 70], and computational biology [14, 35–38, 46]. In addition, successful results of deep learning in drug elds [11, 40, 47, 59] have been achieved and a racted further a ention. Deep learning approaches to drug analyses can be categorized in the following three cases (see Figure 1):\n(A) Deep classi er: Deep learning is used as a back-end classi er for manually cra ed chemical features. e deep learning based classi er has a racted considerable a ention through the Kaggle ‘Merck Molecular Activity Challenge’ and its subsequent quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) predictions [11, 47]. e Kaggle competition and its subsequent predictions showed signi cant improvements in performance, by using the multi-task technique based on deep learning from the provided features. In addition, prediction of chemical-protein interaction [59] (for drug discovery, network pharmacology, and drug/protein target identi cation) showed boosted results by using deep learning from manually cra ed chemical features. Although deep learning improves prediction performance, it has been used only as a classi er based on the well-cra ed chemical features. (B) Deep generator: Deep learning is used as a front-end generator for drug generation. Drug generation extracts the hidden features from the chemicals and then regenerates the chemicals from the extracted features. Generative deep models, such as a variational autoencoder [30] and a recurrent neural network [21], have been used for drug generation [17, 51]. Both models use the simpli ed molecular input line entry system (SMILES) [58] as input to extract the features and regenerate the SMILES string (or functionally similar SMILES string). Deep learning is only used as a deep generator between chemical strings and extracted features. (C) End-to-end deep learning: Deep learning is used as an end-to-end learner which involves the entire process from feature engineering to predicting biological activity. It\nshould extract hidden features from the original chemical inputs and then predict the biological activity by using the extracted features. However, owing to the considerable performance of using the cra ed features and the di culties of handling the original chemical input, the end-to-end learning framework has not been actively pursued.\nDeep learning in drug (chemical) analyses is mainly used as a classi er; however, the original purpose of deep learning is not only for classi cation, but also for extracting hidden representations [41]. e hidden representations, extracted by deep learning, may have potentially important features that are unknown to domain experts. erefore, we expect that end-to-end deep learning can improve prediction performance. For this reason, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework, DeepCCI, for CCI prediction."

      "text" : "For end-to-end learning, it is important that the input contains all the latent feature information of the chemical compound. A considerable amount of chemical information exists, such as weight, molecular formula, rings, atoms, SMILES [66], and InChI [19]. Among the many pieces of information, SMILES represents the chemical structure as a line of ASCII characters. As shown in Figure 2, cyclohexane and acetaminophen are expressed as C1CCCC1 and CC(=O)NC1=CC=C(O)C=C1 respectively (C for carbon, O for oxygen, = for double bonds and 1 for the rst ring). Atoms (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen), bonds (e.g., single, double, and triple bonds), rings (e.g., open ring, close ring, and ring number), aromaticitiy, and branching can be represented with SMILES. As a one-dimensional representation for the chemical structure, SMILES can be converted into a two- or three-dimensional chemical structure, which means that it contains su cient structure information to derive higher dimensions. SMILES is also used for drug generation [17, 51] and for compound similarity [45].\nIt is generally known that structure is closely related to function [48, 54]. QSAR prediction, which exploits the relationship between the chemical structure and the biological activity, for identifying ‘druglikeness’ 1 and establishing metabolic pathways [28, 56]. As an expression of structure information, SMILES can be a means of clarifying the function of a chemical compound.\nFor these reasons, we used SMILES as a front-end input format for representing a chemical compound.\n1Druglikeness is a qualitative indicator to evaluate a drug-like molecule in terms of its bioavailability."

Input x should be converted into a numeric expression for learning.\nFor the numerical expression, we employ a widely used one-hot encoding scheme, which sets the corresponding single character to ‘1’ and all the others to ‘0’, thereby converting each character xi into an |X|-dimensional binary vector.

Chemical compounds of a complex structure have relatively longer SMILES strings compared to compounds of a simple structure. To e ectively learn the hidden representations for SMILES, we limit the inputs to a certain maximum length, λ. If a sequence is shorter than the maximum length, zero values are pre-padded; otherwise, the sequence is truncated to the maximum length. A er the padded or truncated processes, all input lengths are xed to the maximum length, λ.

      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed the rst end-to-end deep learning method for CCI. It showed the best performance compared to a plain deep classi er and conventional machine learning methods.\nDeep learning has shown remarkable success in chemical analyses and a racted considerable research a ention. Despite the success and interest, the cra ed features designed by domain experts continue to be used, even in state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. e objective of deep learning is not merely classi - cation or regression from the cra ed features, but automatically\nextracting meaningful features from the original input and analyzing them. For this reason, we have strived to perform end-to-end deep learning based on SMILES. Our approach showed be er results than using the cra ed PubChem ngerprint. ere are a variety of well-re ned chemical features, and PubChem is one of the competent and widely used descriptors. rough a comparison with the PubChem, we con rmed the possibility of end-to-end SMILES learning, although we did not compare it with all descriptors.\nAutomatic feature learning alleviates the sophisticated e orts required for feature engineering of domain experts and it can enable discovery of meaningful features that are possibly unknown to domain experts. We expect that the proposed end-to-end SMILES learning is applied to other drug (chemical) analyses, such as QSAR prediction, chemical toxicology, and drug target prediction, and it will improve prediction performance.\nIn addition to presenting end-to-end SMILES learning framework, we guaranteed the commutative property in the prediction of CCI. Since CCI is a homogeneous interaction problem, it should produce the same interaction probability for I(A,B) and its converse, I(B,A). To guarantee the commutative property we used model sharing and merging hidden representations techniques and con rmed the property with experimental veri cation. We expect this technique can be applied to other homogeneous symmetric problems, such as protein-protein and gene-gene interactions, as well as other homogeneous comparisons."

    "abstractText" : "Chemical-chemical interaction (CCI) plays a key role in predicting candidate drugs, toxicity, therapeutic eects, and biological functions. CCI was created from text mining, experiments, similarities, and databases; to date, no learning-based CCI prediction method exist. In chemical analyses, computational approaches are required. e recent remarkable growth and outstanding performance of deep learning have aracted considerable research aention. However, even in state-of-the-art drug analyses, deep learning continues to be used only as a classier. Nevertheless, its purpose includes not only simple classication, but also automated feature extraction. In this paper, we propose the rst end-to-end learning method for CCI, named DeepCCI. Hidden features are derived from a simplied molecular input line entry system (SMILES), which is a string notation representing the chemical structure, instead of learning from craed features. To discover hidden representations for the SMILES strings, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To guarantee the commutative property for homogeneous interaction, we apply model sharing and hidden representation merging techniques. e performance of DeepCCI was compared with a plain deep classier and conventional machine learning methods. e proposed DeepCCI showed the best performance in all seven evaluation metrics used. In addition, the commutative property was experimentally validated. e automatically extracted features through end-to-end SMILES learning alleviates the signicant efforts required for manual feature engineering. It is expected to improve prediction performance, in drug analyses.",
