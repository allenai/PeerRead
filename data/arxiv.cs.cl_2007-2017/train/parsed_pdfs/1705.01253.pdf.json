      "text" : "To understand the visual scenes is one of the ultimate goals in computer vision. A lot of intermediate and low-level tasks, such as object detection, recognition, segmentation and tracking, have been studied towards this goal. One of the highlevel tasks towards scene understanding is the visual question answering [Antol et al., 2015]. This task aims at understanding the scenes by answering the questions about the visual data. It also has a wide application, from aiding the visuallyimpaired, analyzing surveillance data to domestic robots.\nThe visual data we are facing everyday are mostly dynamic videos. However, most of the current visual question answering works focus only on images [Bigham et al., 2010; Geman et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Noh et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016]. The images are static and contain far less information than the videos. The task of image-based question answering cannot fit into real-world applications since it ignores the temporal coherence of the scenes.\nExisting video-related question answering works usually combine additional information. The Movie-QA dataset [Tapaswi et al., 2016] contains multiple sources of information: plots, subtitles, video clips, scripts and DVS transcrip-\ntions. These extra information is hard to retrieve in the real world, making these datasets and approaches difficult to extend to general videos.\nUnlike the previous works, we consider the more ubiquitous task of video question answering with only the visual data and the natural language questions. In our task, only the videos, the questions and the corresponding answer choices are presented. We first introduce a dataset collected on our own. To collect a dataset is not an easy task. In image-based question answering (Visual-QA) [Antol et al., 2015], most current collection methods require humans to generate the question-answer pairs [Antol et al., 2015; Malinowski and Fritz, 2014]. This requires a significant amount of human labor. To make things worse, the video has a temporal dimension compared with the image, which implies that the labor of the human annotators is multiplied. To avoid the significant increase of human labor, our solution is to employ the question generation approaches [Heilman and Smith, 2010] to generate question-answer pairs directly from the texts accompanying the videos. Now the collection becomes collecting videos with descriptions. This inspires us to utilize the existing video description datasets. The TGIF (Tumblr GIF) dataset [Li et al., 2016] is a large-scale video description dataset. The groundtruth description provides us the necessary texts to produce the question-answer pairs. Finally, we form our TGIF-QA dataset. Details will be described in the Dataset section.\nExisting visual question answering approaches are not suitable for video question answering since the video question answering has the following features: First, the question may relate to an event which happens across multiple frames. The\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n01 25\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\nM ay\n2 01\n7\ninformation must be gathered among the frames to answer the question. A typical case is the question related to the numbers (see in Fig 1.). The question asks about the number of men in the video. However, in the beginning, we cannot see the correct number of men. Only by watching the video frame by frame can we tell the answer is four. Same is the case in the top-right of Fig 2. Current existing visual-QA approaches cannot be applied as they only utilize the spatial information of a static image. Second, there may be a lot of redundancy in the video frames. In addition to these, our task faces another challenge: the candidate answers are mostly phrases. To tackle these problems, we propose two models: the re-watcher and the re-reader. The re-watcher model meticulously processes the video frames. This model allows to gather information from relevant frames. Then the information is recurrently accumulated as the question is read. The re-reader model can handle phrasal answers and concentrate on the important words in the answers. Then we combine these two models into the forgettable-watcher model.\nOur contribution can be summarized into two aspects: First we introduce a Video-QA dataset TGIF-QA. Second we propose the models which can employ the temporal structure of the videos and the phrasal structure of the candidate answers. We also extend the VQA model [Antol et al., 2015] as a baseline method. We evaluate our models on our proposed TGIFQA dataset. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed models."

The re-watcher model processes the question sentence word sequence meticulously. The re-reader model fully utilizes the information of the video frames along the temporal dimension. And the forgettable-watcher combines both of them.\nWe denote qai as the concatenation of question q and answer ai after word embedding. All our models will take the question and one alternative as a whole sentence which we call the QA-sentence. The QA-sentence and the visual feature sequence are then put into our models to produce a score for the alternative answer in the sentence. In the following sections, we will denote the QA-sentence as c when it does not introduce confusions."

The LSTMs contain an embedding layer which maps\nthe video features and textual features into a joint feature space. We denote the outputs of the forward and backward LSTMs as yf (t) and yb(t). The encoding u of a QA-sentence of length |c| is formed by the concatenation of final outputs of the forward and backward LSTMs, u = [yfc (|c|), ybc(1)].\nFor the video frames, the encoding output for each frame at time t is yv(t) = [yf (t), yb(t)]. The representation r(i) of the videos for each QA-sentence token i is formed by a weighted sum of these output vectors (similar to the attention mechanism in Image-QA [Yang et al., 2016]) and the previous representation r(i− 1): m(i, t) = tanh(Wvmyv(t) +Wrmr(i− 1) +Wcmyc(i)) s(i, t) ∝ exp(WTmsm(i, t)) r(i) = yTd s(i) + tanh(Wrrr(i− 1))\n1 ≤ i ≤ |c| The mechanism of the re-watcher model is that every word will combine with the whole video sequence to generate a state. Then the states of the word sequence is accumulated to generate a combined feature (see Fig 2. left). This model mimics a person who has a bad memory for the video he watches. Every time he reads a word of the QA-sentence, he goes back to watch the whole video to make out what the words in the sentence are about. During this procedure, he selects the information most related to the QA-sentence token from the video and then recurrently accumulate the information as the whole QA-sentence is read. Finally a joint video and QA-sentence representation is formed for producing a score. The score measures how much the question-answer pair (QA-sentence) matches with the video:\ngReW = FC(tanh(Wrgr(|c|) +Wcgu)) where FC represents three fully-connected layers. The activation of the former two layers is ReLU and the last layer is without activation. Since each question has 8 alternatives, each question relates to 8 QA-sentences. For a question and 8 alternatives, we generate 8 such scores and they fill up a 8-dimensional score vector: g = [gReW1 , · · · , gReW8 ] The score vector is then put through the softmax layer."

Every time he watches a frame, he retrospects on the whole question. We denote the encoding output of the QA-sentence at token i as yc(i) = [yfc (i), y b c(i)]. The representation w(t) of the video frames at time t is computed from the weighted sum of the QA-sentence encoding outputs and the previous representation w(t− 1): m(t, i) = tanh(Wcmyc(i) +Wwmw(t− 1) +Wvmyv(t)) s(t, i) ∝ exp(WTmsm(t, i)) w(t) = yTc s(t) + tanh(Wwww(t− 1))\n1 ≤ t ≤ N\nwhere N is the number of frames.

[Bigham et al., 2010; Geman et al., 2015; Antol et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Noh et al., 2016]. The goal of Image-QA is to answer questions given only one image without additional information. Image-QA tasks can be categorized into two types according to the ways answers are generated. The first type is called the Open-Ended question answering [Ren et al., 2015; Malinowski and Fritz, 2014] where answers are produced given only the questions. As the answers generated by the algorithms are usually not the exact words people expect, measures such as the WUPS 0.9 and WUPS 0.0 based on the Wu-Palmer (WUPS) similarity [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014] are employed to measure the answer accuracy. The other type is called the Multiple-Choice question answering [Zhu et al., 2016] where both the question and several candidate answers are presented. To predict the answer is to pick the correct one among the candidates. It is observed that the approaches for the Open-Ended question answering usually cannot produce high-quality long answers [Zhu et al., 2016]. And most Open-Ended question answering approaches only focus on one-word answers [Ren et al., 2015; Malinowski and Fritz, 2014]. As a result, we consider the Multiple-Choice question answering type for our video question answering task. Our candidate answer choices are mainly phrases rather than single words.\nA lot of efforts have been made tackling the Image-QA problem. Some of them have collected their own datasets. Malinowski et al [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014] collected their dataset with the human annotations. Their dataset only focuses on basic colors, numbers and objects. Antol et al. [Antol et al., 2015] manually collected a large-scale free-form Image-QA dataset. Gao et al. [Gao et al., 2015] also manually collected the FM-IQA (Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering) dataset with the help of the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. Most of these methods require a large amount of human labor for collecting data. In contrast, we propose to automatically convert existing video description dataset [Li et al., 2016] into question answering dataset."

While the image question answering has drawn significant attention, video question answering is largely unexplored. Video-QA is different from Image-QA since the information and the events are scattered among multiple frames. In order to better utilize the temporal structure of the videos and the phrasal structures of the answers, we propose two mechanisms: the re-watching and the re-reading mechanisms and combine them into the forgettable-watcher model. Then we propose a TGIF-QA dataset for video question answering with the help of automatic question generation. Finally, we evaluate the models on our dataset. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed models.",
