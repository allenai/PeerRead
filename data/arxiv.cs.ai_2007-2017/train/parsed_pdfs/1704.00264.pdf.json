      "text" : "Motion planning involves collision free navigation of a robot from an initial start region to a goal region in given environments. Applications of this field are not only restricted to robotics [12], but finds application in various other fields such as computer animation [10], medical [23], modern industry [14] and in our daily life [18]. Due to its comprehensive application, many algorithms have been developed in the field of motion planning. Two major classes of motion planning algorithms exist; one is complete algorithms, which successfully return a solution in finite time, if one exists, and reports failure if a feasible solution does not exist. The other class of algorithms does\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 26\n4v 1\nnot assure full completeness but does assure probabilistic or resolution completeness. Many complete motion planning algorithms exist [22] [17] but are often computationally inefficient [3] for common practical applications [6]. Algorithms providing resolution completeness include the example of Artificial Potential Fields (APF) [8] and cell decomposition methods [2]. These algorithms, however, are only effective in problem solving if the resolution parameter of the grid is finely tuned. Moreover Artificial potential fields (APF) perform pure exploitation. Exploitation makes the planner greedy as it assumes that the provided information is sufficient for computing a path solution. Although pure exploitation allows APF to quickly compute the solution but it also causes APF to suffer from the problem of local minima [9]. The other resolution complete algorithm i.e., cell decomposition methods involves extremely large numbers of cells which makes it computationally heavy. Therefore, these limitations make these methods unsuited for the motion planning of robots placed in complex environments. To overcome the problem of inefficiency, computationally efficient sampling based algorithms [11] were introduced. Sampling based algorithms perform pure exploration of configuration space so as to improve the planners’ understanding of the given space. The most effective of these were Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) [7] and Rapidlyexploring Random Trees [13], ensuring probabilistic completeness. This means that as the number of iterations approaches infinity, the probability of finding path , if one exists, approaches one. PRM’s and its variants are multiple-query methods. However, most online motion planning problems can be solved as single-query problems instead [6]. Furthermore, PRM’s need prior computing of the roadmap which is not feasible when the environment it is operating in is unknown. Also, computing a road map during run time is computationally expensive. Rapidly Growing Random Tree algorithms were mainly developed for motion planning problems with differential constraints and for single query problems [13]. Recently, an extension of Rapidly-exploring Random Trees algorithm called Rapidly-exploring Random Tree star (RRT*) [6] was proposed which computes an initial path same as RRT but continues to perform further iterations, increasing the number of samples in the configuration space to optimize this initial path, thereby ensuring asymptotic optimality [5]. This feature is not provided by the RRTs [6]. However some major constraints that still exist in RRT*, due to pure exploration, are its slow rate of convergence in determining an optimal path solution and its high memory requirements. Large memory utilization occurs due to the large number of iterations required to find the optimal path. Although computing an optimal path solution is itself a challenging problem, but fast convergence to optimal solution is also important for most online motion planning problems [4]. This paper introduces the idea of potentially guided, directionalized sampling by incorporating Artificial Potential Field Algorithm (APF) [8] into RRT*, thus resulting into guided exploration of given environment. This speeds up convergence towards a solution as directionalized samples reduces the number of iterations, and consequently execution time, required to achieve an optimal path. Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithms are known for their simplicity and strong mathematical analysis but their applications are limited to a state space of up to five dimensions due to its inability to work in local minima environments [9]. APF primarily uses the effect of unreal forces that act on the robot, generated by both the goal and obstacle regions. This idea of fictitious forces was given by [8]. A similar concept of directionalizing random samples through Artificial potential fields was initially introduced as Potential Guided Directionalized-RRT* (PGD-RRT*) [20]. Although PGD-RRT* finds an initial path very quickly as compared to RRT* but it fails to converge to optimal path solution. Our proposed Potential Functions based RRT* (P-RRT*) is a variant of the previously proposed PGD-RRT* and extension of APGD-RRT* [21]. It efficiently inculcates APF into RRT* to keep the balance between exploitation and exploration i.e., guided exploration of given space. This inculcation helps P-RRT* to direct random samples in the direction of decreasing potential to provide a quick, optimal solution. Moreover, this also results in lesser dispersion of samples in the configuration space and provides a more memory efficient solution operating at a much faster rate compared to RRT*. This idea of\nguiding samples for improving and theoretically characterizing the convergence rate of asymptotically optimal sampling-based algorithms is novel. As per the authors knowledge, no such technique exists of guiding random samples by APF for fast optimal motion planning. This new algorithm has been evaluated under different scenarios including the local minima environment. It has been observed that in almost all the cases, our P-RRT* is more efficient than RRT*. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II addresses the problem definition, Section III explain the RRT* and Artificial Potential Fields algorithms while Section IV describes P-RRT* path planning algorithm in detail. Section V gives a brief outline of the implementation of P-RRT* and RRT* under non-holonomic differential constraints. Section VI presents analysis of the of the proposed algorithm in terms of probabilistic completeness, asymptotic optimality, convergence to optimal solution and computational complexity. Section VII provides experimental evidence in support of theoretical results presented in the previous section; whereas Section VIII concludes the paper, also suggesting some future areas of research in this particular domain."

      "text" : "This section formally presents the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm [6] that is an extension of the standard RRTs algorithm. Algorithm 1 is slightly modified implementation of RRT*. In this modification, improvements were made to original algorithm in order to enhance computational efficiency of RRT* by reducing the number of calls to its collision checking procedure [19]. Following is a brief description of the main processes involved in its execution:\nSampling: The procedure RandomSample(n)\nAlgorithm 1: RRT*(xinit)\n1 V ← {xinit};E ← ∅;T ← (V,E); 2 for n← 0 to N do 3 xrand ← RandomSample(n); 4 Xnear ← NearbyNodes(T, xrand, n); 5 if Xnear = ∅ then 6 Xnear ← NearestNode(xrand, T = (V,E)); 7 L← GetTuple(xrand, Xnear); 8 xparent ← SelectBestParent(L); 9 if xparent 6= ∅ then\n10 T = (V,E)← InsertNode(xrand, xparent, T = (V,E)); 11 E ← RewireNodes(xrand, L,E);\n12 return T = (V,E);\nrandomly samples the given obstacle-free region Xfree to get independent, uniformly distributed configurations.\nNearby Nodes: Considering a configuration x ∈ X and a random tree T = (V,E) where V ⊂ X and the number of vertices in V is defined as n := |V |, the procedure NearbyNodes(T, x, n) provides a set of nodes Xnear ⊂ V lying within a ball of radius r centered at x i.e.,\nNearby(T, x, n) := {v ∈ V : d(v, x) ≤ r :=\nγ( logn\nn )1/d}\nwhere γ is an independent constant such that γ > γ∗ := (2(1 + 1/d))1/d ( µ(Xfree)\nζB\n)1/d and d\nrepresents the dimension of the configuration space.\nNearest Node: Given the configuration x ∈ X, the tree T = (V,E) where V ⊂ X, the NearestNode(x, T ) procedure returns the node v ∈ V that is nearest to the configuration x in terms of Euclidean distance. This procedure can also be summarize as:\nNearestNode(x, T ) = argminv∈V d(v, x)\nLists and Sorting: Given the set X ′ ⊂ X and a random state x ∈ X, the procedure GetTuple(x,X ′) returns the sorted list L. Algorithm 2 provides the pseudocode of this procedure. Each element of this list comprises of cost c ∈ R : c > 0, state x′ ∈ X ′ and the path τ . The list L is equipped with add and sort functions, the former works similar to the one for sets while the latter sorts the list L in ascending order of cost. Extending: Given the two states x1, x2 ∈ X, the function ExtendTo(x1, x2) returns a path τ : [0, 1] → X such that τ(0) = x1 and τ(1) = x2. The extension procedure provides the straight path, i.e., τ(s) = (1− s)x1 + sx2; ∀s ∈ [0, 1].\nCollision checking: Given two configurations x1, x2 ∈ X, a path τ : [0, 1] such that τ(0) = x1 and τ(1) = x2, the procedure CollisonFree(τ) returns true if the path τ belongs to obstacle-free space Xfree\nAlgorithm 2: GetTuple(xrand, Xnear)\n1 L← ∅; 2 for x′ ∈ Xnear do 3 τ ← ExtendTo(x′, xrand); 4 c← c(x′) + c(τ); 5 L← (x′, c, τ); 6 L.sort(); 7 return L;\notherwise it reports failure.\nAlgorithm 1 explains the RRT* algorithm. Once initialized, the RRT* algorithm begins its iterative processing by picking random samples, xrand, from the obstacle-free configuration space Xfree (Line 3). The algorithm then determines the set of near vertices Xnear, described as the vertices of the random tree that lie within the ball region centered at xrand. If no such vertices exist and the set Xnear computed by the NearbyNodes procedure is empty, the set Xnear is then filled by the NearestNode function (Line 4-6). Once populated, the set Xnear is sorted, forming a tuple arranged in ascending order of cost (Line 7). The sorted list L is used by the SelectBestParent function ( Line 8), which returns the best parent vertex xparent ∈ Xnear through which the point xinit and xrand can be connected in obstacle free configuration space. Algorithm 3 outlines the implementation SelectBestParent procedure which iterates through each element in the sorted list L and terminates by returning the vertex through which xrand can be connected to the tree in obstacle-free space. Once the algorithm finds such a state, i.e,\nAlgorithm 3: SelectBestParent(L)\n1 for (x′, c, τ) ∈ L do 2 if CollisionFree(τ) then 3 return x′;"

If the cost of a path lying in obstacle free space and connecting the initial point xinit to x\n′ through the random sample xrand is less than the existing cost of reaching x ′ (Algorithm 4 Line 1-3), then xrand is made into the parent of x′ (Algorithm 4 Line 4-5).

      "text" : "APF by [8] utilizes gradient descent planning that tries to minimize artificial potential energy. The main robot, denoted as x ∈ X, and the goal region Xgoal is assigned an attractive potential Uatt while obstacle regions are assigned repulsive potentials Urep. This causes the robot x to be attracted towards the goal and repelled by the obstacles. These attractive and repulsive potentials cause the robot to experience a force −→ F equal to the negated gradient of potentials i.e., −→ F = − 5 U . Under the influence of both attractive and repulsive forces, the robot moves down the slop and reaches the goal region safely i.e., without any collisions. The constants Ka and Kr indicate the scaling factors that are used to scale the magnitude of attractive and repulsive potential, respectively. These factors are dependent upon the configuration space. Attractive potential experienced by the robot is formulated in equation 1. It varies quadratically when the distance function\nd(x, xg) > d ∗ g. The parameter d ∗ g is the radius of the circular boundary centered at the goal state xg ∈ Xgoal, defining the quadratic range. This quadratic function allows the robot to quickly move towards the goal region due to high attractive forces created between the robot at position x and the goal state xg ∈ Xgoal. However, once the robot enters the circular region centered around xg, the attractive potential starts to vary conically. This allows the robot to move slowly when it comes close to the goal due to reduced attractive potential, thereby preventing it from overshooting the goal region. The attractive force is formulated in equation 2.\nUatt =\n{ Kad 2(x, xg) d(x, xg) > d ∗ g\nKa(d ∗ gd(x, xg)− (d∗g)2) d(x, xg) ≤ d∗g\n(1)\n−→ F att =    −2Kad(x, xg) d(x, xg) > d∗g −2d∗gKa\nx− xg d(x, xg) d(x, xg) ≤ d∗g (2)\nRepulsive potential generated by the obstacles Xobs ⊂ X is formulated in equation 4. Equation (3) is used to calculate the distance dmin of the robot x from the closest vertex in the obstacle space Xobs. Repulsive potential is considered zero if the distance dmin is greater than a constant value d ∗ obs. Such a situation indicates that the robot is at a large distance from the nearest obstacle region. Therefore, to allow the robot to move quickly towards the goal, the repulsive potential is made zero as indicated in equation 4.\ndmin = min x′∈Xobs\nd(x, x′) (3)\nUrep =    1 2 Kr ( 1 dmin − 1 d∗obs )2 dmin ≤ d∗obs\n0 dmin > d ∗ obs\n(4)\nThe repulsive force generated due to Xobs is presented in equation 6 and is equal to the negated gradient of repulsive potential indicated in equation 4.

      "text" : "In this section, we present an extension of RRT* called Potential Function Based-RRT* (P-RRT*), which incorporates the Artificial Potential Field [15] algorithm into RRT*. Further explanations are given in the discussion below. Let a potentially guided, random sample be defined as xprand ∈ Xfree. The random state xrand ∈ Xfree is incrementally directed downhill in the direction of decreasing attractive potential field gradient by a small discrete step denoted as λ ∈ R+. Attractive potential gradient decreases as the random sample approaches closer to the goal region. Algorithm 6\nAlgorithm 6: P-RRT*(xinit)\n1 V ← {xinit};E ← ∅;T ← (V,E); 2 for n← 0 to N do 3 xrand ← RandomSample(n); 4 xprand ← RGD(xrand); 5 Xnear ← NearbyNodes(T, xprand, n); 6 if Xnear = ∅ then 7 Xnear ← NearestNode(xprand, T =\n(V,E));\n8 L← GetTuple(xprand, Xnear); 9 xparent ← SelectBestParent(L);\n10 if xparent 6= ∅ then 11 T = (V,E)← InsertNode(xprand, xparent, T = (V,E)); 12 E ← RewireNodes(xprand, L,E);\n13 return T = (V,E);\noutlines the implementation of P-RRT* algorithm, in this there is only one additional procedure i.e., RGD(x) which is executed just after the sampling procedure. The random sample xrand is augmented with attractive potential field to get an improved sample xprand, and from now on the algorithm treats xprand as its random sample as shown in the algorithm 6. P-RRT*, uses Randomized Gradient Descent Planning for computing xprand ∈ Xfree. Gradient Descent planning explained in the previous section computes the next state as a function of the previous state and works iteratively until |5U | → 0, as shown in Algorithm 5. However, in Randomized Gradient Descent (RGD) Planning, next state is independent of the previous state and for each iteration, a random sample xrand ∈ Xfree is seeded into the RGD(xrand). This random sample is then moved incrementally in the direction of decreasing potential by step size λ to generate xprand ∈ Xfree. It should be noted here that the constant λ is a small incremental step size as stated in section 2. Since, all the procedure used by P-RRT* are same except RGD(x), therefore only RGD(x) procedure is explained here. Following are the set of procedures on which the RGD(xrand) function relies.\nAttractive Potential Gradient (APG): The proposed algorithm only utilizes quadratic variation in the attractive potential fields, instead of shifting between conical and quadratic variation as done in the original Artificial Potential Fields algorithm. In APF, the robot itself is considered under the influence of potential fields. Therefore, conical attractive potential is used to avoid the robot overshooting the goal region. Since in our proposed algorithm, it is the random samples that are under the influence of potential fields, overshooting is not an issue in our case. Hence, the need for conical variation of potential is eliminated. This quadratic attractive field, shown in figure 1, is described by Equations 7 and 8. In figure 1, the horizontal axis is the position of the random sample xrand, where the goal region Xgoal is at its origin (0, 0). The vertical axis corresponds to the quantity of attractive potential field present. This well shaped curve indicates that farther the random sample xrand ∈ Xfree from the origin or goal, greater will be the attractive field.\nUatt = d 2(xrand, xgoal) : xgoal ∈ Xgoal (7)\n−→ F att = −2d(xrand, xgoal) : xgoal ∈ Xgoal (8)\nNearest Obstacle Configuration: This procedure computes the nearest obstacle configuration from the random sample xrand. This procedure utilizes\nequation (3), however in this case, the variable x (i.e., robot configuration) in equation (3) is replaced by the variable xrand (i.e., the random sample). It should be noted that proposed procedure only computes dmin from the point in the obstacle space that is nearest to the random sample. This signifies that just like RRT*, P-RRT* does not require information about obstacle geometry.\nAlgorithm 7 outlines the working of the RGD(xrand) procedure. This function first computes the quadratic attractive potential gradient acting on the independent and identically distributed (iid) sample xrand (Line 3) and then it computes the distance dmin of the random sample from the nearest obstacle configuration (Line 4). Under the influence of the attractive field (Line 8), this random sample is directed in small incremental steps λ ∈ R+ towards the goal. If at any point, dmin ≤ d∗obs, the procedure terminates immediately, returning the new directed sample xprand, otherwise, the procedure continues to direct the random sample for a limited number of iterations k ∈ N and then self terminates. The constant d∗obs represents the distance from the obstacle space and it is kept very small so that the directed random sample xrand is allowed to move very close to the obstacle region Xobs. The significance of keeping d∗obs small will be discussed later in the analysis section. Moreover, the value of k is chosen so as to maintain the balance between exploitation and exploration. Large value of k will result in more exploitation of the configuration space than exploration. Similarly, a very small value will result in more exploration than exploitation."

Therefore, just like RRT* the random tree generated by P-RRT* necessarily includes xinit as one of its states; 2) Just like RRT*, the tree generated by P-RRT* is also a connected tree i.e., whenever a random sample is chosen, it is connected\nto its nearest neighbor state within the tree; and 3) P-RRT* directs the random samples towards the goal region Xgoal, therefore, the probability that the tree generated by P-RRT* will find a goal region approaches to one as the number of iterations approach infinity. Based on the above three arguments, it can be stated that given the path planning problem, the probability that P-RRT* will find a feasible path solution, if one exist, approaches to one as the iterations approaches to infinity. Hence, just like RRT*, the P-RRT* algorithm also ensures probabilistic completeness.\nRest of this section is devoted to emphasize one of the important feature of P-RRT* due to goal directed sampling.

In this case it is the feasible path solution which P-RRT* is aiming to determine.

      "text" : "The proposed algorithm P-RRT* inherits the asymptotic optimality property from the original RRT*. An algorithm is asymptotically optimal if it computes a minimum cost continuous path solution τ∗ : [0, 1] such that τ∗(0) = xinit and τ∗(1) ∈ Xgoal, all the while avoiding any collisions in a cluttered environment. This section analyses the P-RRT* algorithm for its ability to solve problem 2 by ensuring almost sure-convergence to optimal path solution, similar to RRT* based on the assumptions stated below.\nAssumption 1 (Additivity of the cost procedure) For any set of paths in an collision-free space Xfree i.e. τ1, τ2 ∈ ∑ feasible, the cost function c(·) must satisfy: c(τ1) ≤ c(τ1|τ2) : c(τ1|τ2) = c(τ1) + c(τ2).\nAssumption 2 (Continuity of the cost proce-\ndure) The procedure c(·) is a uniformly continuous function such that there exists a Lipschitz constant ε for any two paths τ1 : [0, s1] and τ2 : [0, s2], of similar path lengths i.e., |c(τ1)− c(τ2)| ≤ ε supψ:[0,1]‖c(τ1(ψs1))− c(τ2(ψs2))‖.\nAssumption 3 (δ-spacing of the obstacle) For any state x ∈ Xfree, there exists a ball region that lies entirely in collision-free space Xfree (i.e., Bx′,δ ⊂ Xfree) of radius δ ∈ R>0 centered around another point x′ ∈ Xfree, such that x ∈ Bx′,δ.\nAssumption 1 simply states that the longer path has a higher cost than the shorter one. Assumption 2 ensures that two paths of approximately same length that are very close to one another have a similar cost. Finally, Assumption 3 asserts that there exists some collision-free space around trajectories so that the algorithm can converge them to an optimal path solution. Based on the aforementioned assumptions, the following theorem formalizes the asymptotic optimality of RRT* algorithm.\nTheorem 6 (Asymptotic optimality of RRT* [6] Let Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 hold; then the RRT* algorithm is asymptotic optimal whenever d ≥ 2 and γ > γ∗ := 2d(1 + 1/d)µ(Xfree).\nRecall that the P-RRT* only introduces intelligent sampling heuristic into RRT* thus directionalizing the random samples. The rest of the procedures are same as the RRT*. Therefore theorem 6 holds for P-RRT* just as it holds for RRT* and its proof is similar to the proof of lemma 71 for RRT* [6], based on the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Moreover the value of γ is always chosen to be larger than γ∗ (see definition of procedure NearbyNodes) which ensures that at large number of iterations, the ball of radius δ centered at x′ ∈ Xfree will include atleast one node from the tree T = (V,E). This implies that there is a high probability that the rewiring procedure explained earlier will rewire some paths to minimize their cost functions. Hence given two paths τ1, τ2 ∈ ∑ feasible such that both are the closest to each other in term of path variation ‖τ1− τ2‖, the\nprobability of minimizing path variation to zero is one, when the number of iterations approach infinity. Hence theorem 7 formally states the asymptotic optimality property of P-RRT*.\nTheorem 7 (Asymptotic optimality of PRRT*) Let Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 hold; then the P-RRT* algorithm is asymptotic optimal whenever d ≥ 2 and γ > γ∗ := 2d(1 + 1/d)µ(Xfree)."

      "text" : "P-RRT* inherits asymptotic optimality property from the original RRT* algorithm as discussed in the previous section. This section analyses the P-RRT* algorithm for its ability to solve problem 3 by ensuring almost fast convergence to optimal path solution. To understand the notion of fast convergence, a few new terms are introduced which are as follow. Let δ ∈ R+, then any random configuration x ∈ Xfree can be defined as a δ-interior state Xintδ if the ball region of radius δ centered at x lies entirely in an obstacle-free space. Moreover any random configuration can be defined as a δ-exterior state if the ball region of radius δ centered at x lies partially in an obstacle-free space. Let Xintδ and Xextδ be subsets of the obstacle-free space Xfree. Xintδ comprises of all δ-interior states i.e. Xintδ := {x ∈ Xfree : Bx,δ ⊆ Xfree}, while Xextδ = Xfree\\Xintδ . Therefore, Xextδ states are those states that lie close to obstacle region but not inside it. Based upon the aforementioned assumptions, following definitions describe path solutions with strong δ-clearance and weak δ-clearance, while definition 4 describes the optimal path.\nDefinition 2 (Path with strong δ-clearance)A feasible path solution τ : [0, 1] is said to have strong δ-clearance if τ(s) ∈ Xintδ ;∀s ∈ [0, 1].\nDefinition 3 (Path with weak δ-clearance)A collision-free path τ1 : [0, 1] is said to have weak δ-clearance if there exits a collision-free path τ2 having strong δ-clearance such that i) both paths\nhave same ends i.e. τ1(0) = τ2(0) and τ1(1) = τ2(1); ii) path τ1 can be deformed to τ2 by a homotopy function h : [0, 1] where h(0) = τ1, h(1) = τ2 and h(s) 7→ Xfree,∀s ∈ [0, 1] iii) for a range y ∈ (0, 1], there exists δy ∈ (0, δ] such that the homotopy function h(y) has strong δy-clearance.\nDefinition 4 (Optimal path solution)A collision-free path is said to be optimal τ∗ if it has weak δ-clearance\nThe proposed P-RRT* algorithm is build upon the definition of optimal path solution. Since optimal path solution exists in region with weak δ-clearance, following lemma states that the proposed sampling heuristic (see Algorithm 7) tries to direct the random samples towards the regions where probability of having optimal path solution is high. While lemma 2 states that P-RRT* directs the random sample towards the goal region. Based upon these two lemmas a theorem 8 has been stated which act as an evidence that P-RRT* ensures rapid convergence to optimal solution.\nLemma 1 Given a problem {Xfree, xinit,Xgoal},\nthe potential guided sampling heuristic RGD(x) attempts to direct the random sample x ∈ Xfree so that P(x ∈ Xextδ) > 0, for some value of δ > 0.\nSketch of proof: In a cluttered configuration space X, the potential guided sampling heuristic directs the random sample xrand ∈ Xfree down the slope under the influence of the attractive force. This continues until the sample reaches very close to the obstacles space Xobs or the loop limit is reached (see implementation of algorithm 7). Therefore the proposed heuristic always tries to achieve a weak δ-clearance for the directed samples. Hence it can be concluded that there exists a good probability that a sample xrand belongs to the region with weak δ-clearance i.e. Xextδ . It should also be noted that a large value of d∗obs will not allow the random sample to reach the region with weak δ-clearance, therefore, solution to problem 2 cannot be determined. Moreover weak δ-clearance does not require the nodes to be atleast δ distance away from obstacles. In fact a robustly optimal path with many nodes lying on the boundary of obstacles can still have weak δ-clearance. Therefore a very small value of dobs is needed to solve problem 2.\nFollowing lemma 2 states that the proposed algorithm also guides the random samples towards the goal region.\nLemma 2 Given the path planning problem {Xfree, xinit,Xgoal}, the proposed potential guided sampling heuristic RGD(x) directs the random sample down the potential gradient slope i.e. towards the goal region Xgoal in the obstacle-free space Xfree.\nSketch of proof: An argument for lemma 2 can be given by considering Voronoi regions of the directed nodes as shown in figure 2. Figure 2a depicts the position of starting and goal regions while figure 2b and figure 2c represent the Voronoi diagrams of the directed vertices in the same environment. Unlike RRT* or RRT, the sampling by P-RRT* results in incremental reduction in the size of the Voronoi regions in the direction towards the goal. Therefore it can be said that the proposed heuristic\nhas a Voronoi bias that effectively guides the random samples towards the goal region. Figure 2d to 2f, depicts the Voronoi biasing of RRT*. Moreover, due to this uniform biasing of RRT*, it is able to compute path after 2500 samples, however, due to goal directed Voronoi bias the proposed P-RRT* is able to compute the optimal solution after picking just 60 samples from the configuration space. Based on lemma 1 and 2 stated above, the distinguishing features of P-RRT* can be highlighted. Without further argument it can be said, as formalized in the following theorem, that our proposed heuristic guides the random samples toward the goal region in such a manner so that the guided samples xprand also have weak δ-clearance in cluttered environments.\nTheorem 8 (Potential guided sampling heuristic RGD(x)) Let lemma 1 and 2 hold; then the RGD(x) heuristic guides the random samples towards the goal region in such a manner so that P(xprand ∈ Xextδ) > 0.\nHence, based on definition 4 of optimal path solution and theorem 8, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm P-RRT* computes the optimal path very quickly."

      "heading" : "6.4 Computational Complexity",
      "text" : "This section aims to compare the computational complexities of P-RRT* and RRT*. Let SRRT∗n and SP−RRT∗n denote the number of steps executed per iteration n by RRT* and P-RRT* respectively. In the proposed algorithm, the only additional procedure is RGD(xinit), while the rest of the procedures are exactly the same as used by RRT*. Therefore only the RGD(xinit) procedure is analyzed for its computational load. It is to be noted that the procedures in function RGD can be executed in a constant number of steps and are independent of the number of nodes present in the tree. Furthermore, the algorithm has to compute the nearest obstacle configuration from any random state x ∈ Xfree (Equation 3). Finding the nearest neighbor is a well known problem and\nvarious algorithms have been implemented in this domain. However, the lower bound of complexity of the algorithm by [1] indicates that nearest neighbor searching requires atleast logarithmic time log(n). Implementing the computationally optimal algorithm in [1] for computing nearest obstacle configuration under fixed dimension, implies that it has to run in Ω(logn) time. Since, the algorithm is computationally optimal in fixed dimensions, following lemma states that the computational complexity of executing Equation 3 is nothing more than Ω(logn) time.\nLemma 3 Since the expected limit of number of steps executed by RRT* at each iteration is atleast of the order of log(Nn) time, implementing the computationally optimal algorithm given in [1] under fixed dimensions for computing nearest obstacle configuration, implies that there exists a constant φRRT∗ ∈ R+ i.e.,\nlimn→∞ E [ SRRT∗n log(Nn) ] ≥ φRRT∗\n.\nHence, if lemma 3 holds, then it can be concluded that RRT* and P-RRT* has same asymptotic computational complexity as formalized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 9 Assuming that lemma 3 holds, there exists a constant φ ∈ R+ such that limn→∞ E\n[ SP−RRT∗n SRRT∗n ] ≤ φ ."

      "heading" : "7 Experimental Results",
      "text" : "This section presents simulations performed on a 2.4GHz Intel corei5 processor with 4GB RAM. Performance results of our P-RRT* algorithm are compared with RRT*. For proper comparison, experimental parameters and configuration space size were kept same for both algorithms. Since sampling based algorithms exhibit large variations in results, the algorithms were run upto 50 times for each type of environment. Maximum, minimum and average number of iterations n as well as time t (in seconds) utilized by each algorithm to reach optimal path solution is presented in the table 1. To restrain the computa-\ntional time within reasonable limits, maximum limit for the number of tree nodes was kept at 5 million. The column fail in the tables denotes the number of runs for which the corresponding algorithm failed to find an optimal path solution within node limits. The variable c∗ represents the cost of optimal path returned by the algorithm in terms of Euclidean distance function. Moreover, for P-RRT* algorithm λ = d∗obs = 0.1, while k = 90. However, it was noticed from the experiments that suitable range for k is 80-100. Although, Artificial Potential Field Algorithm suffered from local minima problem, but, since the proposed P-RRT* algorithm only considers the attractive potential gradient, therefore, the P-RRT* algorithm does not inherit this limitation. Figure 3 demonstrates the working of both algorithms in a local minima environment. Figures 3a to 3d and Figures 3e to 3h show convergence progress of P-RRT* and RRT* respectively. It can be seen from these figures that P-RRT* is converging more quickly as compared to RRT* and unlike RRT*, the tree maintained by P-RRT* is directionalized towards the goal region. Figures 4 show the working of P-RRT* and RRT* in a 2D cluttered environment. Figure 4a and 4b demonstrates the initial path and final path solution of PRRT*. Moreover, it can be seen that P-RRT* takes lesser time and iterations (n=200, t=0.045s) as compared to RRT* (n=16063, t= 0.57s) for finding the initial path. Similarly, P-RRT* takes a reasonable number of iterations and time (n=3000, t= 0.65s) to find the optimal trajectory whereas RRT* is not able to find an optimal solution even after 5 million iterations. Moreover, in Figure 4d, half of the region is fully covered by pink red color coating, which is due to the large number of edges resulting from large number of samples that were generated in five million iterations. Figure 5 represents two different complex mazes in 2D environment. In figure 5a and 5b, the start and goal regions, while very close together, require a path solution that traverses the length of a maze and stretches away from the goal. Once again, P-RRT* takes fewer iterations and therefore less time to find optimal path solution as compared to RRT*, as summarized in the table 1. Yet another complex maze environment is presented in Figure 5c and 5d, P-RRT* finds initial and final optimal path much faster than RRT*. Moreover, path returned by RRT* even after 5 million iterations is not an optimal path solution. Figures 6, 7 and 8 depict different scenarios in three dimensional space. Their results are summarized in the table I. It can be seen that a similar trend is followed by the algorithms in all environments i.e., P-RRT* rapidly converges to optimal as compared to RRT*. Figure 10a compares the convergence rate of P-RRT* and RRT* in fifty different environments comprising of both 2D as well as 3D environments. Let initial feasible path denoted τinit ∈ ∑ feasible is computed in tinit time while optimal path solution denoted as τ∗ ∈ ∑feasible is computed in topt time. Then the convergence rate is defined as\nc(τinit)− c(τ∗) topt − tinit . Since\nthe process of convergence to optimal path solution begins after finding initial feasible path solution, convergence rate is calculated after initial path computation. It can be seen in the figure 10a that the convergence rate of P-RRT* remains significantly higher than RRT*, which authenticates fast converging capability of P-RRT*.\nFigure 10c shows memory consumed in bytes by these two algorithms to achieve optimal/near optimal path in twenty different environments. Since, P-RRT* uses lesser iterations as compared to RRT*, it therefore consumes lesser memory for any given environment. Fixed cost is defined in terms of the average Euclidean distance of the most optimized path found by P-RRT* after several runs in a certain 3D environment. RRT* is tested to achieve this fixed cost in the same particular environment, and the result is shown in Figure 13. It can be seen from this figure that RRT* takes more time for converging the feasible path with strong δ-clearance to the feasible path with weak δ-clearance as compared to P-RRT*. Since RRT* consumes more time for converging the path solution therefore it has slower convergence rate as compared to P-RRT*. Figure 14 shows the running time ratio of P-RRT* over RRT* after each iteration is executed. It can be seen that as the number of iterations increases, the running time ratio reaches a constant value. As a matter of fact, in this specific environment, the average amount of time taken by our proposed P-\nRRT* algorithm to determine a viable path to the goal was seen to be barely 1.6 times that of RRT*. Figure 10 demonstrates the effect of k parameter, of P-RRT*, on exploration and exploitation of configuration space. It can be seen that the lower value of k (figure 10a) biases the P-RRT* toward exploration while higher value (figure 10c) leads to more exploitation. It should be noted that the balance between exploitation and exploration is important to allow the algorithm to work in all types of environments. Figure 12 shows the working of P-RRT* and RRT*, under non-holonomic differential constrains, in a 2-D local minima environment. Figure 12a and 12b show the final path solutions of P-RRT* and RRT* respectively. Last row of table 1 summarizes the results of both the algorithm in this environment with differential constraints and it can be seen that P-RRT* takes lesser time and iterations (n=10431, t=1.93s) as compared to RRT* (n=954827, t= 62.9s) for finding the optimal path. Finally, figure 11 shows the implementation of P-RRT* on Poineer 3-DX robot using Player/Stage open source platform."

However, one of the limitation in the RRT* algorithm is slow convergence to optimal path solution. As a result it consumes high memory as well as time due to the large number of iterations utilised in achieving optimal path solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Potential Function Based-RRT* (P-RRT*) that incorporates the Artificial Potential Field Algorithm in RRT*. The proposed algorithm allows a considerable decrease in the number of iterations and thus leads to more efficient memory utilization and an accelerated convergence rate. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm ∗This is the authors’ version of the paper published in Springer Autonomous Robots Journal. The source code of this paper is available at: github.com/ahq1993 with the name of p-rrtstar. in terms of space execution and convergence rate, this paper presents rigorous simulation based comparisons between the proposed techniques and RRT* under different environmental conditions. Moreover, both algorithms are also tested and compared under non-holonomic differential constraints.",
