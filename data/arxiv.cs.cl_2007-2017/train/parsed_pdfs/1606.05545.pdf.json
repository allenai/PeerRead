      "text" : "Semantic composition is a natural process for humans when understanding the sentiment of an opinion. In the sentence ‘He is not very handsome, but he has something that I really like’, humans have the ability to infer that the word ‘very’ emphasizes ‘handsome’, ‘not’ affects the whole expression ‘very handsome’, and ‘but’ decreases the relevance of ‘He is not very handsome’ and increases the one of ‘he has something that I really like’. Based on this, a human could justify a positive overall sentiment on that sentence.\nOur main contribution is the introduction of the first universal and unsupervised model for compositional sentiment analysis (SA) driven by syntax-\n1http://grupolys.org/software/UUUSA/\nbased rules. We introduce a formalism for compositional operations, allowing the creation of arbitrarily complex rules to tackle relevant phenomena for SA, for any language and syntactic dependency annotation. A set of practical universal operations is evaluated on different corpora and languages. The model outperforms existing unsupervised approaches, and state-of-the-art compositional supervised models (Socher et al., 2013) on domain-transfer settings, and shows that the operations can be shared across languages, as they are defined using part-of-speech (PoS) tags and dependency types under the universal guidelines of (Petrov et al., 2011; McDonald et al., 2013)."

      "text" : "A naı̈ve approach to emulate the comprehension of the meaning of multiword phrases for SA consists in using n-grams with n > 1 (Pang et al., 2002). The approach is limited by the curse of dimensionality, although crawling data from the target domain can help to reduce that problem (Kiritchenko et al., 2014). Joshi and Penstein-Rosé (2009) went one step forward and proposed generalized dependency triplets as features for subjectivity detection, capturing non-local relations. Socher et al. (2012) modeled a recursive neural network that learns compositional vector representations for phrases and sentences of arbitrary syntactic type and length. Socher et al. (2013) presented an improved recursive deep model for SA over dependency trees, and trained it on a sentiment treebank tagged using Amazon Mechanical Turk, pushing the state of the art up to 85.4% on the Pang and Lee (2005) dataset. Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) showed how convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be used for semantic modeling of sentences. The model implicitly captures local and non-local relations without the need of a parse\ntree. It can be adapted for any language, as far as enough data is available. Severyn and Moschitti (2015) showed the effectiveness of a CNN in a SemEval SA shared task (Rosenthal et al., 2015), although crawling tens of millions of messages was first required to achieve state-of-the-art results.\nIn spite of being powerful and accurate, supervised approaches also present drawbacks. Firstly, they behave as a black box. Secondly, they do not perform so well on domain transfer applications (Aue and Gamon, 2005; Pang and Lee, 2008). Finally, feature and hyper-parameter engineering can be time and resource costly options.\nWhen these limitations need to be addressed, unsupervised (rule-based) approaches are useful. In this line, Turney (2002) proposed an unsupervised learning algorithm to calculate the semantic orientation (SO) of a word. Taboada et al. (2011) presented a lexical rule-based approach to handle relevant linguistic phenomena such as intensification, negation, ‘but’ clauses and irrealis. Thelwall et al. (2012) released SentiStrength, a multilingual unsupervised system for micro-text SA that handles negation and intensification, among other web linguistic phenomena. Regarding syntax-based approaches, the few described in the literature are language-dependent. Jia et al. (2009) define a set of syntax-based rules for handling negation in English. Vilares et al. (2015a) propose a syntactic SA method, but limited to Spanish reviews and Ancora trees (Taulé et al., 2008).\nIn brief, most unsupervised approaches are language-dependent, and those that can manage multilinguality, such as SentiStrength, cannot apply semantic composition."

      "text" : "Our compositional SA system will associate an SO value σi to each node i in the dependency tree of a sentence, representing the SO of the subtree rooted at i. The system will use a set of compositional operations to propagate changes to the semantic orientations of the nodes in the tree. Once all the relevant operations have been executed, the SO of the sentence will be stored as σ0, i.e., the semantic orientation of the root node.\nA compositional operation is triggered when a node in the tree matches a given condition (related to its associated PoS tag, dependency type and/or word form); and it is applied to a scope of one or more nodes calculated from the trigger node by ascending a number of levels in the tree and then applying a scope function. More formally, we define our operations as follows:\nDefinition 2. Given a dependency tree T (V,E), a compositional operation is a tuple o = (τ, C, δ, π, S) such that:\n• τ : R → R is a transformation function to apply on the SO (σ) of nodes,\n• C : V → {true, false} is a predicate that determines whether a node in the tree will trigger the operation,\n• δ ∈ N is a number of levels that we need to ascend in the tree to calculate the scope of o,\n• π is a priority that will be used to break ties when several operations coincide on a given node, and\n• S is a scope calculation function that will be used to determine the nodes affected by the operation.\nIn practice, our system defines C(i) by means of sets of words, tags and/or dependency types such that the operation will be triggered if wi, ti and/or the head dependency of i are in those sets. Compositional operations where C(i) is defined using universal tags and dependency types only are universal and can be used across languages.\nWe propose two options for the transformation function τ :\n• shiftα(x) =\n{\nx− α if x > 0 x+ α if x < 0 where α is\nthe shifting factor and α, x ∈ R.\n• weightingβ(x) = x× (1+ β) where β is the weighting factor and β, x ∈ R.\nThe scope calculation function, S, allows us to calculate the nodes of T whose SO is affected by the transformation τ . For this purpose, if the operation was triggered by a node i, we apply S to ancestorT (i, δ), i.e., the δth ancestor of i (if it exists), which we call the destination node of the operation. The proposed scopes are as follows (see also Figure 1):\n• dest (destination node): The transformation τ is applied directly to the SO of ancestorT (i, δ) (see Figure 1.a).\n• lm-branchd (branch of d): The affected nodes are lm-branchT (ancestorT (i, δ), d) (see Figure 1.b).\n• rcn (n right children): τ affects the SO of the n smallest indexes of {j ∈ childrenT (ancestorT (i, δ)) | j > i} (see Figure 1.c).\n• lcn (n left children): The transformation affects the n largest elements of {j ∈ childrenT (ancestorT (i, δ)) | j < i} (see Figure 1.d).\n• subjr (first subjective right branch): The affected node is min{j ∈ childrenT (ancestorT (i, δ)) | j > i ∧ σj 6= 0} (see Figure 1.e).\n• subjl (first subjective left branch): The affected node is max{j ∈ childrenT (ancestorT (i, δ)) | j < i ∧ σj 6= 0} (see Figure 1.f).\nCompositional operations can be defined for any language or dependency annotation criterion. While it is possible to add rules for languagespecific phenomena if needed (see § 3.3), in this paper we focus on universal rules to obtain a truly multilingual system.2"

Some options to obtain multilingual subjectivity lexica are SentiStrength (subjective data for up to 34 languages) or the Chen and Skiena (2014) approach, which introduced a method for building sentiment lexicons for 136 languages. Our implementation supports the lexicon format of SentiStrength, which can be plugged directly into the system. Additionally, we provide the option to create different dictionary entries depending on PoS tags to avoid conflicts between homonymous words (e.g. ‘I’m fine’ versus ‘They gave me a fine’).\nThen, we traverse the parse tree in postorder, applying Algorithm 1 to update semantic orientations when visiting each node i. In this algorithm, O is the set of compositional operations defined in our system, Ai is a priority queue of the compositional operations to be applied at node i (because i is their destination node); and Qi is another priority queue of compositional operations to be queued for upper levels at node i (as i is not yet their destination node). ⊕ defines the operation to merge two priority queues, push inserts o in a priority queue and pop pulls the operation with the highest priority (ties are broken by giving preference to the operation that was queued earlier).\nAt a practical level, the set of compositional operations are specified using a simple XML file:\n• <forms>: Indicates the tokens to be taken into account for the condition C that triggers the operation.

Traditional lexiconbased methods handle most of these cases with simple heuristics (e.g. amplifying or diminishing the sentiment of the word following an intensifier). However, ambiguous cases might appear where such lexical heuristics are not sufficient. For example, ‘huge’ can be a subjective adjective introducing its own SO (e.g. ‘The house is huge’), but also an amplifier when it modifies a subjective noun or adjective (e.g. ‘I have huge problems’, where it makes ‘problems’ more negative).\nUniversal compositional operations overcome this problem without the need of any heuristic. A dependency tree already shows the behavior of a word within a sentence thanks to its dependency type, and it shows the role of a word independently of the language. Figure 2 shows graphically how universal dependencies represent the cases discussed above these lines. Formally, the operation for these forms of intensification is: (weightingβ, w ∈ intensifiers∧ t ∈ {ADV,ADJ}∧ d ∈ {advmod,amod,nmod}, 1, 3, dest ∪ lm-branchacomp), with the value of β depending on the strength of the intensifier as given by the sentiment lexicon."

Dependency types help us to determine which nodes should act as negation and which should be its scope of influence. For brevity, we only illustrate some relevant negation cases and instructional examples in Figure 4. Formally, the proposed compositional operation to tackle most forms of negation under universal guidelines is: (shiftα, w ∈ negations ∧ t ∈ U ∧ d ∈ {neg}, 1, 2, dest ∪ lm-branch attr ∪ lm-branchacomp ∪ subjr), where U represents the universal tag set.

      "text" : "In this article, we have described, implemented and evaluated a novel model for universal and unsupervised sentiment analysis driven by a set of syntactic rules for semantic composition. Existing unsupervised approaches are purely lexical, their rules are heavily dependent on the language concerned or they do not consider any kind of natural language processing step in order to be able to handle different languages, using shallow rules instead.\nTo overcome these limitations, we introduce from a theoretical and practical point of view the concept of compositional operations, to define arbitrarily complex semantic relations between different nodes of a dependency tree. Universal partof-speech tagging and dependency parsing guidelines make it feasible to create multilingual sentiment analysis compositional operations that effectively address semantic composition over natural language sentences. The system is not restricted to any corpus or language, and by simply adapting or defining new operations it can be adapted to any other PoS tag or dependency annotation criteria.\nWe have compared our universal unsupervised model with state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised approaches. Experimental results show: (1) that our algorithm outperforms two of the most commonly used unsupervised systems, (2) the universality of the model’s compositional operations across different languages and (3) the usefulness of our approach on domain-transfer applications, especially with respect to supervised models.\nAs future work, we plan to design algorithms for the automatic extraction of compositional operations that capture the semantic relations between tree nodes. We would also like to collect corpora to extend our evaluation to more languages, since collections that are directly available on the web are scarcer than expected. Additionally, the concept of compositional operations is not limited to generic SA and could be adapted for other tasks such as universal aspect extraction. Finally, we plan to adapt the Poria et al. (2014) sentic patterns as compositional operations, so they can be handled universally."

On the one hand, we exploit some of the main advantages of unsupervised algorithms: (1) the interpretability of their output, in contrast with most supervised models, which behave as a black box and (2) their robustness across different corpora and domains. On the other hand, by introducing the concept of compositional operations and exploiting syntactic information in the form of universal dependencies, we tackle one of their main drawbacks: their rigidity on data that are differently structured depending on the language. Experiments show an improvement both over existing unsupervised methods, and over state-of-the-art supervised models when evaluating outside their corpus of origin.
