      "text" : "In Imitation Learning (IL), an agent learns to mimic a supervisor on a task involving sequential decisions (Argall et al., 2009). The generality of this approach has led to a wide range of applications: parsing sentence structure (Ballesteros et al., 2016), playing video games (Guo et al., 2014), robotic manipulation (Laskey et al., 2016b) and self-driving cars (Pomerleau, 1989).\nSimilar to Reinforcement Learning, IL has two types of algorithms: Off-Policy and On-Policy. In Off-Policy IL, an agent observes demonstrations from a supervisor and tries to recover the behavior via supervised learning (Pomerleau, 1989). Off-Policy algorithms are traditionaly referred to as supervised learning or Behavior Cloning (Ross & Bagnell, 2010; Syed & Schapire, 2010). An issue with Off-Policy\n1University of California, Berkeley. Correspondence to: Michael Laskey <laskeymd@berkeley.edu>.\nalgorithms is that the agent may not perfectly agree with the supervisor during training. These small errors can compound during execution of the agent’s policy because the agent may deviate greatly from the states visited by the supervisor (Ross & Bagnell, 2010) and causing the agent to receive non-i.i.d data.\nOn-Policy methods, such as DAgger, attempt to remedy this by sampling trajectories using the current agent’s policy (Ross et al., 2010) and querying the supervisor at each state for the correct action. On-Policy methods have been shown to empirically converge faster than existing OffPolicy methods (Guo et al., 2014).\nWhile the potential for IL algorithms is growing, there remains a challenge of collecting data from supervisors in an efficient manner (Laskey et al., 2016a). Parallelization of data collection is one potential way to achieve this efficiency. For example, in autonomous car applications one could have a large number of human drivers collecting data in parallel on the road. Parallelization can pose a challenge for current On-Policy algorithms when training on large batch updates.\nInuitively, if the agent’s policy is significantly perturbed during an update, then it would visit different states than the previous agent, thus making the data collected at each iteration potentially uninformative. Similar results have been shown in On-Policy Reinforcement Learning and active learning settings (Schulman et al., 2015; Settles & Craven, 2008).\nWe conjecture that when the current agent’s policy becomes a poor predictor, it is better to consider a distribution concentrated on the supervisor’s policy (i.e Off-Policy). The goal of this work is to design this distribution. We begin with a new analysis on the Total Variation Distance between the agent’s and supervisor’s distributions. In relating Total Variation Distance to Hellinger Distance (Le Cam & Yang, 2012), we can bound the covariate shift linearly in the time horizon as a function of the percentage of trajectories they agree on.\nWe then extend this analysis to a less greedy version of OffPolicy, where unbiased noise is injected into the supervisor’s demonstrations. Noise injection can be viewed as placing a more conservative prior over the states the trained agent will likely visit. Leveraging our theoretical analysis, we develop\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n09 32\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 M\nar 2\n01 7\nan algorithm, Dart, that iteratively determines the level of noise to inject into the supervisor via minimizing our bound on the Total Variation Distance. Our algorithm specifically considers the -greedy noise distribution.\nWe test our hypothesis in a grid-world and driving simulator domains. Results suggest that by adding noise to the actions executed by the supervisor’s policy we can reduce the covariate shift and enable sample efficient batch learning. Specifically, results on a driving simulator, where an imageto-action policy is trained, show that Dart can have similar performance to DAgger with 75% fewer demonstrations when 100 demonstrations are collected in a parallelized manner."

      "text" : "The objective of Imitation Learning is to learn a policy that matches what the supervisor demonstrated.\nModeling Choices and Assumptions: We model the system dynamics as Markovian and stochastic. We model the initial state as sampled from a distribution over the state space. We assume a known state space and set of actions. We also assume access to a robot or simulator, such that we can sample from the state sequences induced by a sequence of action. Lastly, we assume access to a supervisor who can, given a state, provide an action, which might be noisy.\nPolicies and State Densities. We denote by S the set consisting of observable states for an agent. We assume S is a finite set of states. We furthermore consider an action set A of size K = |A|. We model dynamics as Markovian, such that the probability of state st+1 ∈ S can be determined from the previous state st ∈ S and action at ∈ A:\np(st+1|a0, s0, . . . at, st) = p(st+1|at, st).\nWe assume a probability density over initial states p(s0). The environment of a task is thus defined as a specific instance of action and state spaces, initial state distribution, and dynamics.\nGiven a time horizon T ∈ N, a trajectory ξ is a finite sequence of T pairs of states visited and corresponding control inputs at these states, ξ = (s0, a0, s1, a1, . . . , sT ), where st ∈ S and at ∈ A for each t.\nA policy is a measurable function π : S → A from states to control inputs. We consider policies πθ : S → A parametrized by some θ ∈ Θ. Under our assumptions, any such policy πθ induces a probability density over the set of trajectories of length T :\np(ξ|πθ) = p(s0) T−1∏ t=0 πθ(at|st)p(st+1|at, st)\nThe term πθ(at|st) indicates stochasticity in the applied\npolicy and we consider this to be a user-defined distribution in which the deterministic output of the policy is a sufficient statistic. A distribution we consider is -greedy, in which with probability a random control is applied instead of πθ(st).\nWhile we do not assume knowledge of the distributions corresponding to p(st+1|st, at) or p(s0), we assume that we have a real robot or a simulator. Therefore, when ‘rolling out’ trajectories under a policy πθ, we utilize the robot or the simulator to sample the resulting stochastic trajectories rather than estimating p(ξ|πθ) itself.\nObjective. The objective of policy learning is to find a policy that maximizes some known reward function R(ξ) =∑T−1 t=0 r(st, at) of a trajectory ξ. The reward r : S ×A → R is typically user defined and task specific. For example in the task of grasping, the reward can be a binary measure of success.\nDefining a reward function that provides enough information for efficient learning can be challenging (Abbeel & Ng, 2004). Thus in Imitation Learning, we do not assume access to a reward function but instead a supervisor, πθ∗ , where θ∗ may not be contained in Θ. We assume the supervisor achieves a desired level of performance on the task, although it may not be optimal.\nWe measure the difference between controls using a surrogate loss l : A × A → R (Ross et al., 2010; Ross & Bagnell, 2010). The surrogate loss we consider is an indicator on the action l(a1, a2) = δa1 6=a2 , which is 1 when the actions disagree and 0 otherwise. We measure total loss along a trajectory with respect to two policies πθ1 and πθ2 by J(θ1, θ2|ξ) = ∑T−1 t=0 l(πθ1(st), πθ2(st)). We note our choice of surrogate loss implies 0 ≤ J(θ1, θ2|ξ) ≤ T .\nThe objective of Imitation Learning is to minimize the expected surrogate loss along the distribution induced by the agent’s policy.\nmin θ Ep(ξ|πθ)J(θ, θ\n∗|ξ) (1)\nIn Eq. 1, the distribution of trajectories and the cumulative surrogate loss are coupled, which makes this a challenging optimization problem. The field of Imitation Learning has considered two types of algorithmic solutions to this objective, off-policy learning and on-policy learning. We review each approach in the following section. We denote Ep(ξ|πθ) = Eθ in the rest of the paper."

Algorithms designed to select p(ξ|πθ̂) can be viewed as placing a prior over the learned agent’s distribution p(ξ|πθ).

It is important to note that during optimization of θ our current indicator loss function l should be replaced with a smooth classification calibrated loss function such as the Hinge Loss (Bartlett et al., 2006).\nWhile there is reason to believe that under a consistent policy representation and infinite data, p(ξ|πθ∗) would be very close to p(ξ|πθ). In practice, small training errors can accumulate during exeuction of the agent’s policy. Thus, causing the agent to deviate significantly from the supervisor’s demonstrations. This notion of a distribution mismatch, or covariate shift, has led to both theoretical and empirical evidence (Ross et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2014) that suggests off-policy learning is not a robust algorithm.\nWhile off-policy algorithms suffer in performance, they can have a large number of implementation advantages. As noted in the active learning literature, methods that decouple data collection from the current model can potentially lead to easier parallelization in data collection. Furthermore, the choice of learning model and hyper-parameters do not have an impact on the data collected, which is advantageous when the model needs to be changed at a later date (Settles & Craven, 2008).\nIn Sec. 4, we offer a new theoretical analysis of this inherent problem that suggests not all types of training errors are equal. We then extend this analysis, in Sec. 5, to show how adding stochasticity to the supervisor’s policy can help alleviate the covariate shift. We then empirically show that we can achieve strong performance and the advantages of off-policy methods."

DAgger operates forN iterations where at each iteration M trajectories are sampled from the distribution p(ξ|πθn , βn). The distribution p(ξ|πθn , βn) is an exponentially decaying stochastic mixing of the supervisor’s distribution and the current agent’s policy. Specifically it sets πθ(a|s, βn) = βnπθ∗(a|s) + (1− βn)πθ(a|s), where β ∈ [0, 1]. After collection of M trajectories, the agent’s policy is retrained on the aggregate dataset.\nA large number of extensions to DAgger have been proposed, such as modifying the supervisor’s policy to be easier to learn (He et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2015) or querying the supervisor for only informative states (Kim & Pineau, 2013; Laskey et al., 2016c).\nIn order to understand how similar p(ξ|πθn) is to p(ξ|πθn+1). Ross et al. proposed analyzing this algorithm in the context of online convex optimization, which considers analyzing the rate of decay of γN , defined as\n1\nN ∣∣∣∣∣ N−1∑ n=0 EθnJ(θn, θ ∗|ξ)−min θ N−1∑ n=0 EθnJ(θ, θ ∗|ξ) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ γN The motivation to consider bounding the average loss over the different agent policies is that the policy with the lowest expected loss (i.e. the returned agent’s policy) after N iterations would also be bounded. Ross et al. additionally consider the effect of β in the analysis, however we are specifically interested in γN . Under the assumption that EθnJ(θ, θ\n∗|ξ) is convex with respect to θ then results exists on how fast γN decays (Shalev-Shwartz, 2011).\nConvergence of γN → 0 is propotional to a bound on the maximum gradient (i.e. ‖∇θnEθnJ(θ, θ∗|ξ)‖ ≤ G) (Hazan et al., 2006) and the number of iterations, N . These terms suggest that on-policy methods could become less effective when N is set small. Furthermore, large changes to expressive models could need more iterations to converge.\nThis can be problematic in situations where we want to train computationally expensive deep neural networks with large\namounts of data collected in batches. Ideally, we would want N to be small to reduce computationally expensive retraining and set M large for situations where parrallized data collection is possible. This raises a key question: is the previous agent’s policy a good prior under these potentially aggressive changes to the current agent?"

Under a significant shift between the two distributions, it is unlikely for a learned model to generalize to the shifted test distribution (Quionero-Candela et al., 2009).\nRoss et al. applied the intuition of covariate shift to OffPolicy Imitation Learning, to bound the expected number of errors the agent performs during execution for the binary classification case.\nTheorem 4.1 (Ross and Bagnell 2010) Denote by πθ a policy found using Off-Policy IL. The following inequality holds:\n|Eθ J(θ, θ∗|ξ)− Eθ∗ J(θ, θ∗|ξ)| ≤\nmin(TEθ∗J(θ, θ ∗|ξ), T )\nTheroem 4.1 suggests Off-Policy IL can perform quite poorly. For example, if Eθ∗J(θ, θ∗|ξ) = 1 then EθJ(θ, θ\n∗|ξ) ≤ T , which implies the agent can incur near maximum error with relatively small error on the supervisor’s distribution. A similar result for the more general classification setting was proved in (Syed & Schapire, 2010). This result has been a motivation for many to perform onpolicy methods (Ross et al., 2010; Le et al., 2016; Levine et al., 2015).\nWhile the problem of covariate shift can lead to arbitrarily poor performance in general, in IL, the problem can be less severe than previously thought. We will now examine the distribution mismatch between the two distributions p(ξ|πθ1) and p(ξ|πθ2). The difference between these two distributions corresponds to amount of error the covariate shift can create.\nWe will assume that probability of controls in these distributions πθ(at|st) is the following for all timesteps in a trajectory.\nπθ(at|st) = { 1 if πθ(st) = at 0 if πθ(st) 6= at\nThe chosen distribution is a deterministic agent in which the intended control of the agent is always applied.\nLemma 4.2 For two deterministic agents with distributions p(ξ|πθ1) and p(ξ|πθ2) over trajectories the following inequality holds:\n||p(ξ|πθ2)− p(ξ|πθ1)||TV ≤ √ 1− (Eθ2d0(θ1, θ2|ξ)) 2\nwhere d0(θ1, θ2|ξ) = δJ(θ1,θ2|ξ)=0 =∏T−1 t=0 δπθ1 (st)=πθ2 (st) or the indicator that the two agents apply the same controls for all states in the trajectory. [See Appendix for Proof]\nLemma 4.2 demonstrates that the distribution mismatch for the two agents can be bounded via the expected fraction of the trajectories on which they match perfectly. The bound is tight in the sense that it has a unique maximum, which is equivalent to the total variation maximum. We will now use Lemma 4.2 to provide new insights into Off-Policy IL."

For example consider the situation where there exist M possible trajectories each with time horizon T = 100. The supervisor’s distribution assigns uniform probability for each trajectory occurring (i.e. p(ξ|πθ∗) = 1M ∀ξ). The agent incurs maximum error, T , on 1% of trajectories and is in perfect agreement on the remaining 99% of trajectories, in this case Eθ∗J(θ, θ∗, ξ) = 1 and Eθ∗ d0(θ, θ∗|ξ)) = 0.99.

      "text" : "In the previous section, Lemma 4.2 illustrated how the expected perfect agreement between the supervisor and the agent can control the total variation distance of their distributions. However, for long time horizon tasks perfect agreement on even a single trajectory may be hard to achieve in practice.\nA reason for this limitation is the deterministic distribution defined on πθ∗(at|st). Under this distribution, any deviation in action between the supervisor and agent along a trajectory could result in very different states being visited. We can overcome this by adding stochasicity to the supervisor’s distribution. Thus, even if the supervisor and agent deviate along a trajectory, with some probability the supervisor could still follow the unknown agent’s policy.\nOne choice of stochasicity to consider is the -greedy probability distribution, which is defined as:\nπθ(at|st, ) =  1− if πθ(st) = at K − 1 if πθ(st) 6= at\nA reason to consider the -greedy distribution is that it places a uniform prior over all controls πθ∗(s). The choice to weight all other controls equally can be thought of as a conservative prior on the distribution of the learned agent’s policy. To indicate that the supervisor’s distribution is also controlled by , we will denote it as p(ξ|πθ∗ , ). The effect that this distribution has on Off-Policy Imitation Learning can be shown with the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.1 Denote by πθ a policy with an -greedy strategy. The following inequality holds:\n|Eθ J(θ, θ∗|ξ)− Eθ∗, J(θ, θ∗|ξ)| ≤\nT √ 1− (Eθ d (θ, θ∗|ξ))2\nwhere,\nd (θ, θ ∗|ξ) =\n(\nK − 1\n) 1 2J(θ,θ ∗|ξ)\n(1− ) 12 (T−J(θ,θ ∗|ξ))\n[See Appendix for Proof]\nThe expression Eθ d (θ, θ∗|ξ) in Theorem 5.2 can be considered a soft form of perfect agreement. In this expression,\nevery trajectory that is possible under the agent’s distribution is weighted by the probability of the supervisor applying those actions. In Theorem 4.3 only the subset of trajectories that were in perfect agreement could be considered. We empirically show how noise can lead to better performance over the deterministic supervisor in Sec. 6.\nWhile Theorem 5.2 only applies to -greedy distribution, we can extend it to the more general setting of arbitrary noise distributions with the following Corollary. We note that in this work, we will only focus on the -greedy distribution.\nCorollary 5.2 Denote by πθ a policy. The following inequality holds:\n|Eθ J(θ, θ∗|ξ)− Eθ∗ J(θ, θ∗|ξ)| ≤\nT √√√√1−(Eθ T−1∏ t=0 √ πθ∗(at|st) )2\nWhile noise injection can reduce the covariate shift, one question is how to best set the level of noise. Intuitively, if the supervisor and agent match perfectly then adding stochasticity to the supervisor’s distribution would cause the total variation distance to grow. Likewise, if the supervisor and agent are in very large disagreement, choosing = K−1K and performing random actions is sensible.

We will write the objective as:\n∗ = argmax Eθ d (θ, θ ∗|ξ) (3)\nThe goal of this objective is to maximize a measure of the probability the supervisor overlaps the agent’s distribution. In practice, we will not have access to the true expectation in Eq. 3. Thus, we need to generate trajectory drawn from via C trajectory samples. While one approach is to first estimate 1 C ∑C c=1 d (θ, θ\n∗|ξc) , we found that the sampled polynomial terms in d (θ, θ∗|ξ) can cause very high variance when computing this estimate. Thus, we will consider a biased estimate derived from the first-order taylor expansion around the first moment for the variable X = J(θ, θ∗|ξ) (Esmaili, 2006).\nAlgorithm 2 Dart Input: 0 for n = 0 to N − 1 do\nfor m = 1 to M do ξn,m ∼ p(ξ|πθ∗ , n) end for θn+1 = arg min\nθ\n∑n i=0 ∑M j=1 J(θ, θ ∗|ξi,j)\nfor c = 1 to C do ξn,c ∼ p(ξ|πθn+1) end for Ĵ = 1C ∑C c=1 J(θn+1, θ\n∗|ξn,c) n+1 = Ĵ T\nend for\n≈ (\nK − 1\n) 1 2Eθ J(θ,θ ∗|ξ)\n(1− ) 1 2 (T−EθJ(θ,θ ∗|ξ)) (4)\nAn advantage of this term is that the sample estimate is only the surrogate loss of the agent’s policy.

Dart operates for N iterations. At each iteration a batch size of M demonstrations are sampled from p(ξ|πθ∗ , n), where n is the current estimate of the best . The algorithm then optimizes for θn+1 on the aggregate dataset, similar to DAgger. Dart then evaluates the current agent policies via sampling C times from p(ξ|πθn) and sets n+1 = 1C ∑C c=1 J(θn+1,θ ∗|ξn,c) T to compute the level of noise to inject.\nWe note that Dart does require the additional overhead of policy evaluation at each iteration. While this can be an issue, Dart is intended for large batch updates where the data needed to train is much larger than for evaluation (i.e. M >> C). Furthermore, it is common practice to evaluate the performance of the agent’s policy after each update (Laskey et al., 2016a). In these situations, our method would need no additional samples.\nA key question of this algorithm is how increasingM affects performance. The insight of Dart is that as M becomes large the current agent’s policy will become a worse prior for the final agent’s distribution. Thus, the prior to sample from may be concentrated around the policy the agent is trying to learn (i.e. the supervisors). Dart encapsulates this intuition by setting as function of the agent’s current error Eθn J(θn, θ ∗|ξ)."

We also compare a stochastic mixing of the supervisor and current robot’s policy, where β = 0.5, i.e. with 50% probability the agent’s action is taken instead of the supervisor. This comparison is useful to test the need for the more conservative -greedy distribution. We refer to this method as ’50/50’.\nFor Dart, we report two initializations 0 = 0.4 and\n0 = 0.5. For DAgger, we set β via grid-searching over {0.0, 0.1, ..., 0.9}. We found the best β is the indicator function βn = δn=0, which corresponds to not sampling from the supervisor after the first iteration. We initialized ’50/50’, DAgger and Supervised Learning with one demonstration of the deterministic supervisor’s policy. Dart is initialized with a demonstration from the stochastic supervisor corresponding to 0.\nOur results, shown in Fig. 1, suggest that as the batch size grows DAgger’s performance decreases, however our offpolicy algorithm remains unaffected. We attribute this to the fact that the current agent’s distribution, p(ξ|πθn) , becomes a worse prior for p(ξ|πθN ) as the batch size grows. By sampling from p(ξ|πθ∗ , n), we are able to better predict the distribution the agent will converge to.\nThe traditional off-policy approach (i.e. supervised learning) does poorly in this domain, which is consistent with prior literature (Ross et al., 2010). Finally the stochastic mixing method ’50/50’ performs poorly compared to both DAgger and Dart.\nWe note that Dart does require an additional 5 samples per iteration to evaluate the policy.

The other vehicles are randomly placed on the road at each iteration, thus the agent must learn a policy that generalizes to random vehicle configurations.\nEach car has a non-holonomic bicycle car dynamics model with an internal state space of position, acceleration and velocity. The position specifies both translation and rotation: {x, y, ρ}. The agent’s car has initial state variance uniform over ρ ∈ [−30, 30]. The other cars’ have uniform initial state variance over translation, but are always driving forward (i.e. ρ = 0.0). There are 5 other vehicles, per track. The agent drives twice as fast as the other vehicles, thus it must learn to navigate around them.\nThe state space of the simulator is gray-scale 8-bit images of the workspace, in the set S = [0, 255]300×300. The images are centered around the agent’s car at all times. Examples of the simulator can be seen in Fig. 3. The action space of the car is the selection of a steering angle for the car A = {−30◦,−15◦, 0◦, 15◦, 30◦}. We measure reward in terms of the number of time-steps the agent is able to travel before\ncrashing, which is defined as going off-road or colliding with another vehicle. We terminate the environment if the agent successfully navigates T = 100 time-steps.\nThe supervisor is a cost-based search planner that has access to the internal dynamics of the game engine and a lower dimensional state space. The cost function is weighted to ensure that the planner tries to find collision-free paths that keep the car near the center of the road. The supervisor is able to travel 70 time-steps on average before crashing.\nOur neural net architecture consists of a convolutional layer, with 5 filters 7x7 dimensions, a fully connected layer that maps to a 60 dimensional hidden state space and a final fully connected layer that maps to the controls space. Each layer is seperated by ReLU non-linearities. The architecture design was inspired by that used in (Laskey et al., 2016b). The network was trained using TensorFlow on a GeForce 1080. We used momentum for optimization with learning rate 0.9.\nEach roll-out of a policy takes 5 seconds, where the majority of the computation comes from the supervisor’s planner. In order to produce a large amount of data, we parallelized each roll-out on a 4 core Intel Core i7 CPU. Due to the time requirements of training a network and the ability to parallelize data collection, we are interested in working with a large batch size of data (i.e. M = 100) for 4 iterations. We chose C = 10 for the policy evaluation step of Dart.\nIn this experiment, we compare DAgger, Supervised Learning, ’50/50’ and Dart. DAgger’s β term is set via gridsearch over a smaller batch size of M = 20 for N = 4 iterations. We found that βn = δn=0 performed best. We set Dart’s initial parameter 0 = 0.5 because we expected high approximation error. Also, because each rollout has a potentially different time horizon Tc, we compute Ĵ = ∑C c=1 100 J(θn,θ ∗|ξc) Tc , which re-weights the samples by the maximum fixed time-horizon of T = 100. We also compared against DAgger-50, which is DAgger with a batch size of M = 50 instead of M = 100.\nIn Fig. 4, we plot the performance of the five methods in terms of distance traveled. Each method is averaged over 20 trials of the algorithm and the policy is evaluated on\n20 roll-outs at each iteration. Dart is robust to the large batch sizes, which results in more robust policy earlier on. Interestingly, as the batch size decreases between DAgger50 and DAgger there is a performance increase. A limitation of this performance gain is that it limits the amount of data that can be collected in parallel."

      "text" : "We contributed a new analysis of off-policy methods that bounds the error caused by covariate shift. We then use this analysis to demonstrate how injecting noise into the supervisor’s policy can reduce the covaraite shift. Finally, we contributed an algorithm, Dart, that enables robustness to the original choice of and accelerates learning.\nOur analysis in Theroem 4.3 illustrates that expected cumulative surrogate loss is not always a good indicator for agent’s performance. The proposed idea of perfect agreement offers new insights to the covariate shift problem by examining error on the trajectory level. In future work, we hope to determine the rate of decay on this quantity using Rademacher Complexity analysis.\nWhile Dart is able to perform well on the domains presented, it may be challenging for large or continuous action spaces. In lage action spaces the problem of predicting the learned agent’s policy will naturally become harder. In future work, we will examine distributions over continuous actions that exhibit concentration around the supervisor’s policy, for example Gaussian distributions. We will also examine alternative ways to set by leveraging work on sample complexity analysis (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002)\nto estimate how the agent’s loss will decay ahead of time."

The robot also receives a −0.02 penalty for every blank state. The robot must learn to be robust to the noise in the dynamics, reach the goal state and then stay there. The robot has a state space of (x, y) coordinates and a set of actions consisting of {Left, Right, Forward, Backward, Stay} state. The grid size for the environment is 30× 30. 8% of randomly drawn states are marked as a penalties, while only one is a goal state. For the transition dynamics, p(st+1|st, at), the robot goes to an adjacent state different from the one desired uniformly at random with probability 0.16. The time horizon for the policy is T = 70.\nWe use Value Iteration to compute an optimal supervisor. We run all trials over 100 randomly generated environments. We report normalized performance, where 1.0 represents matching the expected cumulative reward of the deterministic supervisor. The robot’s policy is represented as a Linear SVM."

The reason for two different classes is too see how varying test error effects the best . Each model is trained in Sci-Kit Learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011).\nThe Results shown in Fig. 5, shows performance over a range of parameters. We observed for the Linear SVM, who had on average EθJ(θ, θ∗|ξ) = 0.2 , the best are 0.5 and 0.6. However for the Decision Tree who on average had EθJ(θ, θ∗|ξ) = 0.04 test error, the best noise term was between 0.1 and 0.2. Thus suggesting, the better an agent is able to learn the data the lower the noise term needs to be. Our analysis in Theorem 5.2 also illustrates such a relationship."

    "abstractText" : "In Imitation Learning, a supervisor’s policy is observed and the intended behavior is learned. A known problem with this approach is covariate shift, which occurs because the agent visits different states than the supervisor. Rolling out the current agent’s policy, an on-policy method, allows for collecting data along a distribution similar to the updated agent’s policy. However this approach can become less effective as the demonstrations are collected in very large batch sizes, which reduces the relevance of data collected in previous iterations. In this paper, we propose to alleviate the covariate shift via the injection of artificial noise into the supervisor’s policy. We prove an improved bound on the loss due to the covariate shift, and introduce an algorithm that leverages our analysis to estimate the level of -greedy noise to inject. In a driving simulator domain where an agent learns an image-to-action deep network policy, our algorithm Dart achieves a better performance than DAgger with 75% fewer demonstrations.",
