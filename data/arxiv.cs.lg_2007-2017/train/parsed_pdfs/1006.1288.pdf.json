      "text" : "A fundamental problem of machine learning is the learning of a distance between data samples. When the distance can be written as a quadratic form (either in the data space (Mahalanobis distance) or in a kernel feature space (kernel distance)), the learning problem is a regression problem on the set of positive definite matrices. The regression problem is turned into the minimization of the prediction error, leading to an optimization framework and gradient-based algorithms.\nThe present paper focuses on the nonlinear nature of the search space. The classical framework of gradient-based learning can be generalized provided that the nonlinear search space is equipped with a proper Riemannian geometry. Adopting this general framework,\nar X\niv :1\n00 6.\n12 88\nv1 [\ncs .L\nwe design novel learning algorithms on the space of fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices, denoted by S+(r, d), where d is the dimension of the matrix, and r is its rank. Learning a parametric model in S+(r, d) amounts to jointly learn a r-dimensional subspace and a quadratic distance in this subspace.\nThe framework is motivated by low-rank learning in large-scale applications. If the data space is of dimension d, the goal is to maintain a linear computational complexity O(d). In contrast to the classical approach of first reducing the dimension of the data and then learning a distance in the reduced space, there is an obvious conceptual advantage to perform the two tasks simultaneously. If this objective can be achieved without increasing the numerical cost of the algorithm, the advantage becomes also practical.\nOur approach makes use of two quotient geometries of the set S+(r, d) that have been recently studied by Journée et al. (2010) and Bonnabel and Sepulchre (2009). Making use of a general theory of line-search algorithms in quotient matrix spaces (Absil et al., 2008), we obtain concrete gradient updates that maintain the rank and the positivity of the learned model at each iteration. This is because the update is intrinsically constrained to belong to the nonlinear search space, in contrast to early learning algorithms that neglect the non linear nature of the search space in the update and impose the constraints a posteriori (Xing et al., 2002; Globerson and Roweis, 2005).\nNot surprisingly, our approach has close connections with a number of recent contributions on learning algorithms. Learning problems over nonlinear matrix spaces include the learning of subspaces (Crammer, 2006; Warmuth, 2007), rotation matrices (Arora, 2009), and positive definite matrices (Tsuda et al., 2005). The space of (full-rank) positive definite matrices S+(d) is of particular interest since it coincides with our set of interest in the particular case r = d.\nThe use of Bregman divergences and alternating projection has been recently investigated for learning in S+(d). Tsuda et al. (2005) propose to use the von Neumann divergence, resulting in a generalization of the well-known AdaBoost algorithm (Schapire and Singer, 1999) to positive definite matrices. The use of the so-called LogDet divergence has also been investigated by Davis et al. (2007) in the context of Mahalanobis distance learning.\nMore recently, algorithmic work has focused on scalability in terms of dimensionality and data set size. A natural extension of the previous work on positive definite matrices is thus to consider low-rank positive semidefinite matrices. Indeed, whereas algorithms based on full-rank matrices scale as O(d3) and require O(d2) storage units, algorithms based on low-rank matrices scale as O(dr2) and require O(dr) storage units (Fine et al., 2001; Bach and Jordan, 2005). This is a significant complexity reduction as the approximation rank r is typically very small compared to the dimension of the problem d.\nExtending the work of Tsuda et al. (2005), Kulis et al. (2009) recently considered the learning of positive semidefinite matrices. The authors consider Bregman divergence measures that enjoy convexity properties and lead to updates that preserve the rank as well as the positive semidefinite property. However, these divergence-based algorithms intrinsically constrain the learning algorithm to a fixed range space. A practical limitation of this approach is that the subspace of the learned matrix is fixed beforehand by the initial condition of the algorithm.\nThe approach proposed in the present paper is in a sense more classical (we just perform a line-search in a Riemannian manifold) but we show how to interpret Bregman divergence\nbased algorithms in our framework. This is potentially a contribution of independent interest since a general convergence theory exists for line-search algorithms on Riemannian manifolds. The generality of the proposed framework is of course motivated by the nonconvex nature of the rank constraint.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the general optimization framework of Riemannian learning. This framework is then applied to the learning of subspaces (Section 3), positive definite matrices (Section 4) and fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices (Section 5). The novel proposed algorithms are presented in Section 6. Section 7 discusses the relationship to existing work as well as extensions of the proposed approach. Applications are presented in Section 8 and experimental results are presented in Section 9."

      "text" : "We consider the following standard regression problem. Given\n(i) data points X, in a linear data space X = Rd×d,\n(ii) observations y, in a linear output space Y = R, (or Rd),\n(iii) a regression model ŷ = ŷW(X) parameterized by a matrix W in a search space W,\n(iv) a quadratic loss function `(ŷ, y) = 12(ŷ − y) 2,\nfind the optimal fit W∗ that minimizes the expected cost\nF (W) = EX,y{`(ŷ, y)} = ∫ `(ŷ, y) dP (X, y), (1)\nwhere `(ŷ, y) penalizes the discrepancy between observations and predictions, and P (X, y) is the (unknown) joint probability distribution over data and observation pairs. Although our main interest will be in the scalar model\nŷ = Tr(WX),\nthe theory applies equally to vector data points x ∈ Rd, ŷ = Tr(WxxT ) = xTWx, to a regression model parameterized by a vector w ∈ Rd, ŷ = wTx, or to a vector output space ŷ = Wx.\nAs it is generally not possible to compute F (W) explicitly, batch learning algorithms minimize instead the empirical cost\nfn(W) = 1\n2n n∑ i=1 (ŷi − yi)2, (2)\nwhich is the average loss computed over a finite number of samples {(Xi, yi)}ni=1. Online learning algorithms (Bottou, 2004) consider possibly infinite sets of samples {(Xt, yt)}t≥1, received one at a time. At time t, the online learning algorithm minimizes the instantaneous cost\nft(W) = 1\n2 (ŷt − yt)2.\nIn the sequel, we only present online versions of algorithms to shorten the exposition. The single necessary change to convert an online algorithm into its batch counterpart is to perform, at each iteration, the minimization of the empirical cost fn instead of the minimization of the instantaneous cost ft. In the sequel, we denote by f the cost function that is minimized at each iteration.\nOur focus will be on nonlinear search spacesW. We only requireW to have the structure of a Riemannian matrix manifold. Following Absil et al. (2008), an abstract gradient descent algorithm can then be derived based on the update formula\nWt+1 = RWt(−st gradf(Wt)). (3)\nThe gradient gradf(Wt) is an element of the tangent space TWtW. The scalar st > 0 is the step size. The retraction RWt is a mapping from the tangent space TWtW to the Riemannian manifold. Under mild conditions on the retraction R, the classical convergence theory of line-search algorithms in linear spaces generalizes to Riemannian manifolds (see Absil et al., 2008, Chapter 4).\nObserve that the standard (online) learning algorithm for linear regression in Rd,\nwt+1 = wt − st(wTt xt − yt)xt, (4)\ncan be interpreted as a particular case of (3) for the linear model ŷ = wTx in the linear search space W = Rd. The Euclidean metric turns Rd in a (flat) Riemannian manifold. For a scalar function f : Rd → R of w, the gradient satisfies\nDf(w)[δ] = δT gradf(w),\nwhere Df(w)[δ] is the directional derivative of f in the direction δ, and the natural retraction\nRwt(−st gradf(wt)) = wt − st gradf(wt)\ninduces a line-search along “straight lines” which are geodesics (that is paths of shortest length) in linear spaces. With f(w) = 12(w\nTx− y)2, one arrives at (4). This example illustrates that the main ingredients to obtain a concrete algorithm are convenient formulas for the gradient and for the retraction mapping. This paper provides such formulas for three examples of nonlinear matrix search spaces: the Grassmann manifold (Section 3), the cone of positive definite matrices (Section 4), and the set of fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices (Section 5). Each of those sets will be equipped with quotient Riemannian geometries that provide convenient formulas for the gradient and for the retractions. Line-search algorithms in quotient Riemannian spaces are discussed in detail in the book of Absil et al. (2008). For the readers convenience, basic concepts and notations are also provided in Appendix A."

      "text" : "As a preparatory step to Section 5, we review the online subspace learning (Oja, 1992; Crammer, 2006; Warmuth, 2007) in the present framework. Let X = Y = Rd, and consider the linear model\nŷ = UUTx\nwith U ∈ St(r, d) = {U ∈ Rr×d s.t. UTU = I}, the Stiefel manifold of r-dimensional orthonormal bases in Rd. The quadratic loss is then\nf(U) = `(ŷ,x) = 1\n2 ‖ŷ − x‖22 =\n1 2 ‖UUTx− x‖22. (5)\nBecause the cost (5) is invariant by orthogonal transformation U 7→ UO, O ∈ O(r), where O(r) = St(r, r) is the orthogonal group, the search space is in fact a set of equivalence classes\n[U] = {UO s.t. O ∈ O(r)}.\nThis set is denoted by St(r, d)/O(r). It is a quotient representation of the set of rdimensional subspaces in Rd, that is, the Grassmann manifold Gr(r, d). The quotient geometries of Gr(r, d) have been well studied (Edelman et al., 1998; Absil et al., 2004).

Tangent vectors ξ[U] at [U] are represented by horizontal tangent vectors ξ̄U at U:\nξ̄U = ΠU∆ = (I−UUT )∆, ∆ ∈ Rd×r.\nTherefore, the gradient admits the simple horizontal representation\ngradf(U) = ΠU gradf̄(U), (6)\nwhere gradf̄(U) is defined by the identity\nDf̄(U)[∆] = ḡU(∆, gradf̄(U)).\nA standard retraction in Gr(r, d) is the exponential mapping, that induces a line-search along geodesics. The exponential map has the closed-form expression\nExpU(ξ̄U) = UV cos(Σ)V T + Z sin(Σ)VT\nwhich is obtained from a singular value decomposition of the horizontal vector ξ̄U = ZΣV T . Following Absil et al. (2004), an alternative convenient retraction in Gr(r, d) is given by\nRU(sξ̄U) = [U + sξ̄U] = qf(U + sξ̄U), (7)\nwhere qf(·) extracts the orthogonal factor of the QR-decomposition of its argument. With the formulas (6) and (7) applied to the cost function (5), the abstract update (3) becomes Ut+1 = qf(Ut + st(I−UtUt)xtxTt Ut),\nwhich is Oja’s update for subspace tracking (Oja, 1992)."

Since W is symmetric, only the symmetric part of X will contribute to the trace. The previous model is thus equivalent to\nŷ = Tr(WSym(X)),\nwhere Sym(·) extract the symmetric part of its argument, that is, Sym(B) = (BT + B)/2. The quadratic loss is\nf(W) = `(ŷ, y) = 1\n2 (Tr(WSym(X))− y)2.\nThe quotient geometries of S+(d) are rooted in the matrix factorization\nW = GGT , G ∈ GL(d),\nwhere GL(d) is the set of all invertible d×d matrices. Because the factorization is invariant by rotation, G 7→ GO, O ∈ O(d), the search space is once again identified to the quotient\nS+(d) ' GL(d)/O(d),\nwhich represents the set of equivalence classes\n[G] = {GO s.t. O ∈ O(d)}.\nWe will equip this quotient with two meaningful Riemannian metrics.\n4.1 A flat metric on S+(d)\nThe metric on the quotient GL(d)/O(d):\ng[G](ξ[G], ζ[G]) , ḡG(ξ̄G, ζ̄G),\nis induced by the standard metric in Rd×d,\nḡG(∆1,∆2) = Tr(∆ T 1 ∆2), (8)\nwhich is invariant by rotation along the set of equivalence classes. As a consequence, it induces a metric g[G] on S+(d). With this geometry, a tangent vector ξ[G] at [G] is represented by a horizontal tangent vector ξ̄G at G by\nξ̄G = Sym(∆)G, ∆ ∈ Rd×d.\nThe horizontal gradient of\nf(G) = `(ŷ, y) = 1\n2 (Tr(GGTSym(X))− y)2, (9)\nis the unique horizontal vector gradf(G) that satisfies\nDf(G)[∆] = ḡG(∆, gradf(G)).\nElementary computations yield\ngradf(G) = 2(ŷ − y)Sym(X)G.\nSince the metric is flat, geodesics are straight lines and the exponential mapping is\nExpG(ξ̄G) = [G + ξ̄G] = G + ξ̄G.\nThose formulas applied to the cost (9) turns the abstract update (3) into the simple formula\nGt+1 = Gt − 2st(ŷt − yt)Sym(Xt)Gt (10)\nfor an online gradient algorithm and\nGt+1 = Gt − 2st 1\nn n∑ i=1 (ŷi − yi)Sym(Xi)Gt (11)\nfor a batch gradient algorithm.\n4.2 The affine-invariant metric on S+(d)\nBecause S+(d) ' GL(d)/O(d) is the quotient of two Lie groups, its (reductive) geometric structure can be further exploited (Faraut and Koranyi, 1994). Indeed the group GL(d) has a natural action on S+(d) via the transformation W 7→ AWAT for any A ∈ GL(d). The affine-invariant metric admits interesting invariance properties to these transformations. To build such a metric, the metric at identity\ngI(ξI, ζI) = Tr(ξ T I ζI)\ncan be extended to the entire space to satisfy the invariance property\ngI(ξI, ζI) = gW(W 1 2 ξIW 1 2 ,W 1 2 ζIW 1 2 ) = gW(ξW, ζW).\nThe resulting metric on S+(d) is defined by\ngW(ξW, ζW) = Tr(ξWW −1ζWW −1). (12)\nThe affine-invariant geometry of S+(d) has been well studied, in particular in the context of information geometry (Smith, 2005). Indeed, any positive definite matrix W ∈ S+(d) can be identified to the multivariate normal distribution N (0,W). Using such a metric allows to endow the space of parameters S+(d) with a distance that reflects the proximity of the probability distributions. The Riemannian metric thus distorts the Euclidean distances between positive definite matrices in order to reflect the amount of information between the two associated probability distributions. If ξW is a tangent vector to W ∈ S+(d), we have the following approximation for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (up to third order terms)\nDKL(W||W + ξW) ≈ ξTWJWξW = gW(ξW, ζW)\nwhere JW is the Fisher information matrix at W. This approximation coincides with the Riemannian distance that is induced by the affine-invariant metric (12) (Smith, 2005). With this geometry, tangent vectors ξW are expressed as\nξW = W 1 2 Sym(∆)W 1 2 , ∆ ∈ Rd×d.\nThe gradient gradf(W) is given by\nDf(W)[∆] = gW(∆, gradf(W)).\nApplying this formula to (4) yields\ngradf(W) = (ŷ − y)WSym(X)W. (13)\nThe exponential mapping has the closed-form expression\nExpW(ξW) = W 1 2 exp(W− 1 2 ξWW − 1 2 )W 1 2 . (14)\nIts first-order approximation provides the convenient retraction\nRW(sξW) = W − sξW. (15)\nThe formulas (13) and (14) applied to the cost (4) turn the abstract update (3) into\nWt+1 = W 1 2 t exp(−st(ŷt − yt)W 1 2 t Sym(Xt)W 1 2 t )W 1 2 t .\nWith the alternative retraction (15), the update becomes\nWt+1 = Wt − st(ŷt − yt)WtSym(Xt)Wt,\nwhich is the update of Davis et al. (2007) based on the LogDet divergence (see Section 7.1).\n4.3 The log-Euclidean metric on S+(d)\nFor the sake of completeness, we briefly review a third Riemannian geometry of S+(d), that exploits the property W = exp(S), S = ST ∈ Rd×d. The matrix exponential thus provides a global diffeomorphism between S+(d) and the linear space of d×d symmetric matrices. This geometry is studied in detail in the paper (Arsigny et al., 2007). The cost function\n`(ŷ, y) = f(S) = 1\n2 (Tr(exp(S)Sym(X))− y)2\nthus defines a cost function in the linear space of symmetric matrices. The gradient of this cost function is given by gradf(S) = (ŷt − yt)Sym(Xt), and the retraction is\nRS(sξS) = exp(log W + sξS)\nThe corresponding gradient descent update is\nWt+1 = exp(log Wt − st(ŷt − yt)Sym(Xt)),\nwhich is the update of Tsuda et al. (2005) based on the von Neumann divergence."

They intrinsically have a much slower convergence rate than batch algorithms, but they generally decrease faster the expected loss in the large-scale regime (Bottou and Bousquet, 2007). The main idea is that, given a training set of samples, an inaccurate solution may indeed have the same or a lower expected cost than a well-optimized one.\nWhen learning a matrix W ∈ S+(d), the problem is convex and the proposed algorithms converge toward a global minimum of the cost function, regardless of the initial condition. When learning a low-rank matrix W ∈ S+(r, d), with r < d, the proposed algorithms converge to a local minimum of the cost function.\nFor batch algorithms, these statements follow from the convergence theory of line-search algorithms on Riemannian manifolds (see, for example, Absil et al., 2008).\nFor online algorithms, one can prove that the algorithm based on the flat geometry enjoys almost sure asymptotic convergence to a local minimum of the expected cost. In that case, the parameter G belongs to an Euclidean space and the convergence results presented by Bottou (1998) apply directly (see Appendix B for the main ideas of the proof).\nWhen the polar parameterization is used, the convergence results presented by Bottou (1998) do not apply directly. However, we empirically observed that the algorithm always converges to a local minimum of the cost function. Numerical simulations thus suggest that the results of Bottou (1998) on stochastic gradient descent extend to the gradient descent algorithm based on polar parameterization. This issue is left as a topic for future research."

      "text" : "A standard derivation of learning algorithms is as follows (Kivinen and Warmuth, 1997). The (online) update at time t is viewed as an (approximate) solution of\nWt+1 = arg min W∈W D(W,Wt) + st `(ŷ, yt), (26)\nwhere D is a well-chosen measure of closeness between elements of W and st is a tradeoff parameter that controls the balance between the conservative term D(W,Wt) and the innovation (or data fitting) term `(ŷ, yt). One solves (26) by solving the algebraic equation\ngrad D(W,Wt) = −st grad `(ŷt+1, yt), (27)\nwhich is a first-order (necessary) optimality condition. If the search space W is a Riemannian manifold and if the closeness measure D(W,Wt) is the Riemannian distance, the solution of (27) is\nWt+1 = ExpWt(−st grad `(ŷt+1, yt)).\nBecause ŷt+1 must be evaluated in Wt+1, this update equation is implicit. However, ŷt+1 is generally replaced by ŷt (which is equal to ŷt+1 up to first order terms in st), which gives the update (3) where the exponential mapping is chosen as a retraction.\nBregman divergences have been popular closeness measures for D(W,Wt) because they render the optimization of (26) convex. Bregman divergences on the cone of positive definite matrices include the von Neumann divergence\nDvN (W,Wt) = Tr(W log W −W log Wt −W + Wt),\nand the LogDet divergence\nDld(W,Wt) = Tr(WW −1 t )− log det(WW −1 t )− d.\nWe have shown in Section 4 that the resulting updates can be interpreted as line-search updates for the log-Euclidean metric and the affine-invariant metric of S+(d) and for specific choices of the retraction mapping.\nLikewise, the algorithm (10) can be recast in the framework (26) by considering the closeness\nDflat(W,Wt) = ‖G−Gt‖2F ,\nwhere W = GGT and Wt = GtG T t . Algorithm (21) can be recast in the framework (26) by considering the closeness\nDpol(W,Wt) = λ r∑ i=1 θ2i + (1− λ) ‖ log R−1t R2R −1 t ‖2F .\nwhere the θi’s are the principal angles between the subspaces spanned by W and Wt (Golub and Van Loan, 1996), and the second term is the affine-invariant distance of S+(d) between matrices R2 and R2t involved in the polar representation of W and Wt.\nObviously, these closeness measures are no longer convex due to the rank constraint. However they reduce to the popular divergences in the full-rank case, up to second order terms. In particular, when λ = 1, the subspace is fixed and one recovers the setup of learning low-rank matrices of fixed range space (Kulis et al., 2009). Thus the algorithms introduced in the present paper can be viewed as generalizations of the ones presented in (Kulis et al., 2009). The authors of (Kulis et al., 2009) present the issue of adapting the range space as an open research question. Each of the proposed algorithms provides an efficient workaround for this problem at the expense of the (potential) introduction of local minima."

This inner product information is used solely to compute the relevant quantities needed by the algorithms based on the kernel. For instance, a distance is implicitly defined by any kernel function as the Euclidean distance between the samples in the new feature space\ndφ(xi,xj) = ‖φ(xi)− φ(xj)‖2 = κ(xi,xi) + κ(xj ,xj)− 2κ(xi,xj),\nwhich can be evaluated using only the elements of the kernel matrix by the formula\ndφ(xi,xj) = Kii + Kjj − 2Kij = Tr ( K(ei − ej)(ei − ej)T ) ,\nwhich fits into the considered regression model.\nLearning a kernel consists in computing the kernel (or Gram) matrix from scratch or improving a existing kernel matrix based on side-information (in a semi-supervised setting for instance). Data samples and class labels are generally exploited by means of equality or inequality constraints involving pairwise distances or inner products.\nMost of the numerous kernel learning algorithms that have been proposed work in the socalled transductive setting, that is, it is not possible to generalize the learned kernel function to new data samples (Kwok and Tsang, 2003; Lanckriet et al., 2004; Tsuda et al., 2005; Zhuang et al., 2009; Kulis et al., 2009). In that setting, the total number of considered samples is known in advance and determines the size of the learned matrix. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to learn a kernel function that can be extended to new points (Chatpatanasiri et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2009). In this paper, we only consider the kernel learning problem in the transductive setting.\nWhen low-rank matrices are considered, kernel learning algorithms can be regarded as dimensionality reduction methods. Very popular unsupervised algorithms in that context are kernel principal component analysis (Schölkopf et al., 1998) and multidimensional scaling (Cox and Cox, 2001; Borg and Groenen, 2005). Other kernel learning techniques include the maximum variance unfolding algorithm (Weinberger et al., 2004) and its semisupervised version (Song et al., 2007), and the kernel spectral regression framework (Cai et al., 2007) which encompasses many reduction criterion (for example, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), locality preserving projection (LPP), neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE)). See the survey of (Yang, 2006) for a more complete state-of-the-art in this area.\nSince our algorithms are able to compute a low-rank kernel matrix from data, they can be used for unsupervised or semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, depending whether or not the class labels are exploited through the imposed constraints."

Let xi,xj ∈ Rd be two data samples, the (squared) Mahalanobis distance between these two samples is parametrized by a positive definite matrix A ∈ Rd×d and writes as\ndA(xi,xj) = (xi − xj)TA (xi − xj). (28)\nIn the particular case of A being equal to the identity matrix, the standard Euclidean distance is obtained. A frequently used matrix is A = Σ−1, the inverse of the sample covariance matrix. For centered data features, computing this Mahalanobis distance is equivalent to perform a whitening of the data before computing the Euclidean distance.\nFor low-rank Mahalanobis matrices, computing the distance1 is equivalent to first perform a linear data reduction step before computing the Euclidean distance on the reduced data. Learning a low-rank Mahalanobis matrix can thus be seen as learning a linear projector that is used for dimension reduction.\nIn contrast to kernel functions, Mahalanobis distances easily generalize to new data samples since the sole knowledge of A determines the distance function.\nIn recent years, Mahalanobis distance learning algorithms have been the subject of many contributions that cannot be all enumerated here. We review a few of them, most relevant for the present paper. The first proposed methods have been based on successive projections onto a set of large margin constraints (Xing et al., 2002; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2004). The method proposed by Globerson and Roweis (2005) seeks a Mahalanobis matrix that maximizes the between classes distance while forcing to zero the within classes distance. A simpler objective is pursued by the algorithms that optimize the Mahalanobis distance for the specific k-nearest neighbor classifier (Goldberger et al., 2004; Torresani and Lee, 2006; Weinberger and Saul, 2009). Bregman projection based methods minimize a particular Bregman divergence under distance constraints. Both batch (Davis et al., 2007) and online (Jain et al., 2008) formulations have been proposed for learning full-rank matrices. Low-rank matrices have also been considered with Bregman divergences but only when the range space of the matrix is fixed in the first place (Davis and Dhillon, 2008; Kulis et al., 2009)."

As a normalization step, the data features are centered and rescaled to unit standard deviation.\n1.

The data vectors x1, ...,xn ∈ Rd and the target matrix W∗ ∈ S+(r, d) are generated with entries drawn from a standard Gaussian distribution N (0, 1). Observations follow\nyi = (x T i W ∗xi)(1 + νi), i = 1, ..., n, (29)\nwhere νi is drawn fromN (0, 0.01). A multiplicative noise model is preferred over an additive one to easily control that observations remain nonnegative after the superposition of noise.\nLearning the subspace versus fixing the subspace up front. As an illustrative example, we show the difference between two approaches for fitting the data to observations when a target model W∗ ∈ S+(3, 3) is approximated with a parameter W ∈ S+(2, 3).\nA naive approach to tackle that problem is to first project the data xi ∈ R3 on a subspace of reduced dimension and then to compute a full-rank model based on the projected data. Recent methods compute that subspace of reduced dimension using principal component analysis (Davis and Dhillon, 2008; Weinberger and Saul, 2009), that is, a subspace that captures a maximal amount of variance in the data. However, in general, there is no reason why the subspace spanned by the top principal components should coincide with the subspace that is defined by the target model. Therefore, a more appropriate approach\n2.

The target model is\nW∗ = ŨΛŨT (30)\nwhere Ũ is a random 3×3 orthogonal matrix and Λ is a diagonal matrix with two dominant values Λ11,Λ22 Λ33 > 0 (for this specific example, Λ11 = 4,Λ22 = 3 and Λ33 = 0.01). Observations yi are thus nearly generated by a rank-2 model, such that W\n∗ should be well approximated with W ∈ S+(2, 3) that minimizes the train error.\nResults are presented in Figure 2. The top plot shows that the learned subspace (which identifies with the target subspace) is indeed very different from the subspace spanned by the top two principal components. Moreover, the bottom plots clearly demonstrate that the fit is much better when the subspace and the distance in that subspace are learned jointly. For visualization purpose, the two dimensional model is represented by the ellipse\nE = {x̃i ∈ R2 : x̃Ti R2x̃i = 1}, where x̃i = UTxi√ yi ,\nand (U,R2) are computed with algorithm (22), either in the setting λ = 0 that fixes the subspace to the PCA subspace (left) or in the setting λ = 0.5 that simultaneously learned U and B (right). A perfect fit is obtained when the points x̃i are all located on E , which is the locus of points where ŷi = yi.\nInfluence of the parameter λ on the algorithm based on the polar geometry. In theory, the parameter λ should not influence the algorithm since it has no effect on the first-order optimality conditions except for its two extreme values λ = 0 and λ = 1. In practice however, a sensitivity to this parameter is observed due to the finite tolerance of the stopping criterion: the looser the tolerance, the more sensitive to λ.\nTo investigate the sensitivity to λ, we try to recover a target parameter W∗ ∈ S+(5, 10) using pairs (xi, yi) generated according to (29). We generate 10 random regression problems\nwith 1000 samples partitioned into 500 learning samples and 500 test samples. We compute the mean test error and the mean convergence time as a function of λ for different values of tol. The results are presented in Figure 3. As tol decrease, the test error becomes insensitive to λ, but an influence is observed on the convergence time of the algorithm.\nIn view of these results, we recommend the value 0.5 as the default setting for λ. Unless specified otherwise, we therefore use this particular value for all experiments in this paper.\nOnline versus Batch. This experiment shows that when a large amount of sample is available (80, 000 training samples and 20, 000 test samples for learning a parameter W∗ in S+(10, 50)), online algorithms minimize the test error more rapidly than batch ones. It further shows that the mini-batch extension allows to improve significantly the performance compared to the plain stochastic gradient descent setting (p = 1). We observe that the minibatch size p = 32 generally gives good results. Figure 4 report the test error as a function of the learning time, that is, the time after each iteration for batch algorithm and the time after each epoch for online algorithms. For the algorithm based on the polar geometry, the mini-batch extension is strongly recommended to amortize the larger cost of each update."

We compare the proposed batch methods with the LogDet-KL algorithm, the only competing algorithm that also learns directly from distance constraints. This algorithm is the best performer reported by Kulis et al. (2009) for this experiment. All algorithms start from the identity matrix that do not encode any domain information. Figure 5 (left) reports the k-NN classification accuracy as a function of the number of distance constraints provided. In this full-rank learning setting, the algorithm based on the polar geometry compete with the LogDet-KL algorithm. The convergence time of the algorithm based on the polar geometry is however much faster (0.15 seconds versus 58 seconds for LogDet-KL when learning 1000 constraints). The algorithm based on the flat geometry has inferior performance when too few constraints are provided. This is because in the kernel learning setting, updates of this algorithm only involve the rows and columns that correspond to the set of points for which constraints are provided. It may thus result in a partial update of the kernel matrix entries. This issue disappears as the number of provided constraints increases.\nThe second experiment is reproduced from Kulis et al.

The figure\nshows that KSR, LogDet-KL and the algorithm based on the polar geometry with λ = 0 perform similarly. These methods are however outperformed by the proposed algorithms (flat geometry and polar geometry with λ = 0.5) when the number of constraints is large enough.

We use the test set of the USPS dataset7, which contains 2007 samples of handwritten zip code digits. The data are first transformed using the kernel map κ(xi,xj) = exp(−γ‖xi − xj‖22) with γ = 0.001 and we further center the data in the kernel feature space.

Figure 6 (right) reports the clustering performance as a function of the approximation rank when the number of constraints provided is fixed to 100K. When the number of provided constraints is large enough, the proposed algorithms perform as good as KSR and outperform the LogDet-KL method that learn a kernel of fixed-range space. Average computational times for learning a rank-6 kernel from 100K constraints are 0.57 seconds for KSR, 3.25 seconds for the algorithm based on the flat geometry, 46.78 seconds for LogDet-KL and 47.30 seconds for the algorithm based on the polar geometry.

The rich Riemannian geometry of the set of fixed-rank PSD matrices is exploited through a geometric optimization approach.\nThe resulting algorithms overcome the main difficulties encountered by the previously proposed methods as they scale to high-dimensional problems, and they naturally enforce\nthe rank constraint as well as the positive definite property while leaving the range space of the matrix free to evolve during optimization.\nWe apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function from data, when the distance is parameterized by a fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrix. The good performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated over several benchmarks."

      "heading" : "Appendix A. Line-search algorithms on matrix manifolds",
      "text" : "This appendix summarizes the exposition of Absil et al. (2008, chap. 3 and 4).\nRestrictions on the search space are generally encoded into optimization algorithms by means of particular constraints or penalties expressed as a function of the search variable. However, when the search space is endowed with a particular manifold structure, it is possible to design an exploration strategy that is consistent with the geometry of the problem and that appropriately turns the problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. This approach is the purpose of optimization algorithms defined on matrix manifolds.\nInformally, a manifold W is a space endowed with a differentiable structure. One usually make the distinction between embedded submanifolds (subsets of larger manifolds) and\nquotient manifolds (manifolds described by a set of equivalence classes). An intuitive example of embedded submanifold is the sphere embedded in Rd. A typical example of quotient manifold is the set of r-dimensional subspaces in Rd, viewed as a collection of r-dimensional orthogonal frames that cannot be superposed by a rotation. The rotational variants of a given frame thus define an equivalence class (denoted using square brackets [·]), which is identified as a single point on the quotient manifold.\nTo develop line-search algorithms, the notion of gradient of a scalar cost function needs to be extended to manifolds. For that purpose, the manifold W is endowed with a metric gW(ξW, ζW), which is an inner product defined between elements ξW, ζW of the tangent space TWW at W. The metric induces a norm on the tangent space TWW at W:\n‖ξW‖W = √ gW(ξW, ξW)\nThe gradient of a smooth scalar function f : W → R at W ∈ W is the only element gradf(W) ∈ TWW that satisfies\nDf(W)[∆] = gW(∆, gradf(W)), ∀∆ ∈ TWW, (31)\nwhere ∆ is a matrix representation of a “geometric” tangent vectors ξ, and where\nDf(W)[∆] = lim t→0 f(W + t∆)− f(W) t ,\nis the standard directional derivative of f at W in the direction ∆. For quotient manifoldsW =W/ ∼, whereW is the total space and ∼ is the equivalence relation that defines the quotient, the tangent space T[W]W at [W] is sufficiently described by the directions that do not induce any displacement in the set of equivalence classes [W]. This is achieved by restricting the tangent space at [W] to horizontal vectors ξ̄W ∈ TWW at W that are orthogonal to the equivalence classe [W]. Provided that the metric ḡW in\nthe total space is invariant along the equivalence classes, it defines a metric in the quotient space\ng[W](ξ[W], ζ[W]) , ḡW(ξ̄W, ζ̄W).\nThe horizontal gradient gradf(W) is obtained by projecting the gradient gradf̄(W) in the total space onto the set of horizontal vectors ξ̄W at W.\nNatural displacements at W in a direction ξW on the manifold are performed by following geodesics (paths of shortest length on the manifold) starting from W and tangent to ξW. This is performed by means of the exponential mapping\nWt+1 = ExpWt(stξWt), (32)\nwhich induces a line-search algorithm along geodesics.\nA more general update formula is obtained if we relax the constraint of moving along geodesics. The retraction mapping\nWt+1 = RWt(stξWt),\nlocally approximates the exponential mapping. It provides an attractive alternative to the exponential mapping in the design of optimization algorithms on manifolds, as it reduces the computational complexity of the update while retaining the essential properties that ensure convergence results. When ξWt coincide with −gradf(Wt) a gradient descent algorithm on the manifold is obtained. Figure 9 pictures a gradient descent update on W.\nAppendix B. Convergence proof of algorithm (10)\nBottou (1998) reviews the mathematical tools required to prove almost sure convergence, that is asymptotic convergence with probability one, of stochastic gradient algorithms. Adapting the results presented for vectors w in Rd to matrices G of Rd×r, we have that the following five assumptions guarantee that a stochastic gradient algorithm converges:\n(A1) F (G) = EX,y{`(ŷ, y)} ≥ 0 is three times differentiable with bounded derivatives,\n(A2) ∑∞\nt=1 s 2 t <∞ and ∑∞ t=1 st =∞,\n(A3) EX,y{‖gradf(G)‖2F } ≤ k1 + k2‖G‖2F , where f(G) = `(ŷ, y),\n(A4) ∃h1 > 0, inf ‖G‖2F>h1 Tr(GT gradf(G)) > 0,\n(A5) ∃h2 > h1, ∀(X, y) ∈ X × Y, sup ‖G‖2F<h2 ‖gradf(G)‖F ≤ k3,\nwhere ‖ · ‖F is the Frobenius norm. For bounded input matrices X and observations y, algorithm (10) minimizing the quadratic cost (9) fulfills the five assumptions (A1) to (A5). Hence, the following convergence result applies.\nProposition 1 The stochastic gradient descent algorithm (10) equipped with the step size schedule (24) converge almost surely to the set of stationary points of F (G).\nProof The proof is completed in two steps. First, it is shown that the stochastic sequence\nut = max(h2, ‖Gt‖2F ),\ndefines a Lyapunov process (always positive and decreasing on average) which converges almost surely to h2. This implies that Gt is almost surely confined within distance √ h2 from the origin and provides almost sure bounds on all continuous functions of Gt.\nSecond, the Lyapunov process vt = F (Gt) ≥ 0 is proved to converge almost surely. Convergence of F (Gt) is then used to show that wt = grad F (Gt) tends to zero almost surely. Technical details are provided in the paper of Bottou (1998).\nIn practice, saddle points and local maxima are unstable solutions while convergence to asymptotic plateaus is excluded by (A4). As a result, almost sure convergence to a local minimum of the expected cost is obtained."

The focus is on the nonlinear nature of the search space and on scalability to high-dimensional problems. The mathematical developments rely on the theory of gradient descent algorithms adapted to the Riemannian geometry that underlies the set of fixed-rank positive semidefinite matrices. In contrast with previous contributions in the literature, no restrictions are imposed on the range space of the learned matrix. The resulting algorithms maintain a linear complexity in the problem size and enjoy important invariance properties. We apply the proposed algorithms to the problem of learning a distance function parameterized by a positive semidefinite matrix. Good performance is observed on classical benchmarks.",
