      "text" : "matic speech recognition has been reported in several contexts such as domain change or speaker characteristics. This paper proposes a novel technique to overcome negative transfer by efficient selection of speech data for acoustic model training. Here data is chosen on relevance for a specific target. A submodular function based on likelihood ratios is used to determine how acoustically similar each training utterance is to a target test set. The approach is evaluated on a wide–domain data set, covering speech from radio and TV broadcasts, telephone conversations, meetings, lectures and read speech. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique both finds relevant data and limits negative transfer. Results on a 6–hour test set show a relative improvement of 4% with data selection over using all data in PLP based models, and 2% with DNN features.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems improve their accuracy, new applications and domains become the target of research. Automatic transcription of speech with unknown origin is a challenging task, which is related to access to so–called “found data”, such as media and historical audio archives. For this to be feasible, ASR has to produce an accurate output for whichever the conditions contained in the target data (e.g. interviews, distant recordings, telephone conversations, etc). Training acoustic models for an unknown domain, e.g. YouTube recordings, can be infeasible if the origin of the target speech can not be properly assessed, and the loss of accuracy can be large due to wrong modelling decisions. Another option is to train an acoustic model on a large amount of data from multiple domains, although this is not guaranteed to give the most optimal results.\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is still a standard approach to train acoustic models in ASR, either with perceptually–based features like Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) features [1], or with Deep Neural Network (DNN) based features [2] in tandem configuration. However, MLE has two well–known requirements: first, model correctness is assumed; and second the amount of training data is required to be infinite [3]. None of the above are valid in standard situations in ASR, although systems are sometimes trained with many years of speech data (e.g [4]). However, adding more data does not guarantee that the performance of the system will improve, and even if it does, the gains become smaller and smaller [5]. A further effect, negative transfer, is found in several examples, which indicates that knowledge acquired for a task can have a negative performance effect in another task\n[6]. As a result, being able to select informative training data remains an important task.\nThis paper studies positive and negative transfer in ASR in a multi–domain scenario. The work proposes to use submodular functions based on acoustic similarity between the target test set and training data, in which positive transfer will be exploited to improve performance across domains, while reducing the impact of negative transfer at the same time. Submodular functions have been successfully used before to select data in semisupervised training and active learning for ASR tasks [7, 8]. However, here we show that these can also be used to select acoustically matching data in an un–supervised manner.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a review of data selection techniques for ASR, and Section 3 introduces the proposed approach for data selection. Section 4 describes the experimental setup, followed by results and analysis in Section 5. The final Section 6 summarises and concludes the paper."

      "heading" : "2. Data selection for ASR",
      "text" : "Data selection for ASR has mostly been studied for minimal representative data selection [5, 8, 9, 7, 10, 11, 4, 12, 13]. Here the objective is, given a large pool of training data, to find a subset of data such that a model set trained with that data will achieve comparable performance to a model set trained with all the data. This line of work is related to active learning, where the aim is to select a subset for manual transcription with the least budget [14, 15, 16], and with unsupervised and semi– supervised learning techniques, where the overall objective is to select a subset of the training set with the most reliable available transcripts [17, 18, 19].\nTwo techniques are typically used for selecting data: uncertainty sampling [20], where the scores from an existing model are used to choose or reject data; and query by committee [21], where votes of distinctly trained models are used [7]. For uncertainty sampling two types of scores have been explored. Confidence scores are used to select data with the most reliable transcriptions, as in semi–supervised training [17, 4], or to select data for manual transcription in active learning [15, 14]. Entropy–based methods aim to pick data that, for instance, fits a uniform distribution of target units (phonemes, words, etc), resulting in maximum entropy [7, 10, 9] or having a similar distribution to a target set [12, 13, 19].\nThe use of submodular functions has been proposed to tackle the effect of the diminishing returns, when adding more data to a training set [8, 5, 7]. A submodular function is defined as any function f : 2Ω → R that fulfils\nf(S) + f(T ) ≥ f(S ∪ T ) + f(S ∩ T ), ∀S, T ⊆ Ω (1)\nWith submodular functions the problem of data selection turns into a submodular maximisation problem, where the ob-\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n02 40\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nS ep\n2 01\n5\njective is to find a subset S from the complete training set Ω so that any new subset T added to S will not increase the value of the submodular function f :\nargmax S⊆Ω\n{f(S)|f(S ∪ T ) < f(S), T ⊆ Ω \\ S} (2)\nFinding S is an NP–hard problem [22, 8] and greedy solutions are proposed where the subset S is increased iteratively by the item s ∈ Ω that maximises the value of f when added to S as in Equation 3.\ns = argmax s∈Ω\\S\n{f(S ∪ {s})} (3)\nThe set S is obtained when either the optimal S is found (f(S) > f(S ∪ {s})), or a budget N is reached (|S| ≤ N ).\nIf the function f is a normalised monotone submodular function, then the simple greedy algorithm provides a good approximation of the optimal solution [23, 22, 7]\nSeveral functions f can be found in the literature to perform data selection for ASR tasks, including facility location functions, saturated coverage functions [24, 8], diversity reward functions [5] or graph cut functions [7]."

      "heading" : "3. Likelihood ratio data selection",
      "text" : "To decide whether data bears resemblance to a training set, one can opt for a classification approach that identifies an item to be suitable or not. Here we make use of the Likelihood Ratio (LR) between a GMM trained on the target data (Θtgt), and a GMM trained on the complete training set (ΘΩ). The total LR of an utterance in the training set LR(O),O ∈ Ω of length T frames is defined as the geometric mean of the frame–based LR values of the target data model Θtgt and the background model ΘΩ, assuming frame independence.\nLR(O) = 1 T T∑ t=1 p(Ot|Θtgt) p(Ot|ΘΩ)\n(4)\nOne can define a modular function [22] based on the accumulated LRs of all utterances included in a subset S ⊆ Ω in the following form:\nfLR(S) = ∑ O∈S ( LR(O) ) . (5)\nModular functions are a special case of submodular functions [22] where the greater than or equal sign in Equation 1 changes to the equal sign. This way, the proposed function fLR is submodular as well. And since all of the values for LR are non–negative, and therefore any sum of these numbers, as constituted by the function f , the function is necessarily monotonic with expanding sets (A ⊆ B ⊆ Ω, f(A) ≤ f(B)). If a submodular function is non–decreasing and normalised (f(∅) = 0), then the greedy solution obtained by Equation 3 is no worse than the optimal value by a constant fraction (1− 1/e) [23]. Thus the subset S (greedy solution) can be used as the training set. The stopping criterion for adding more data to this subset S is based on a “budget”, in the form of a maximum amount of hours of speech to be used."

      "heading" : "4. Experimental setup",
      "text" : "To evaluate the proposed approach in a multi–domain ASR task, a data set combining 6 different types of data was chosen from the following sources:\n• Radio (RD): BBC Radio4 broadcasts on February 2009. • Television (TV): Broadcasts from BBC on May 2008. • Telephone speech (CT): From the Fisher corpus1 [25]. • Meetings (MT): From AMI [26] and ICSI [27] corpora. • Lectures (TK): From TedTalks [28]. • Read speech (RS): From the WSJCAM0 corpus [29].\nA subset of 10h from each domain was selected to form the training set (60h in total), and 1h from each domain was used for testing (6h in total). The selection of the domains aims to cover the most common and distinctive types of audio recordings used in ASR tasks.\nTwo types of acoustic features were used: first, 13 PLP features plus first and second derivatives for a total of 39– dimensional feature vectors; and second, a 65–dimensional feature vector concatenating the 39 PLP features and 26 bottleneck (BN) features extracted from a 4–hidden–layer DNN trained on the full 60 hours of data. 31 adjacent frames (15 frames to the left and 15 frames to the right) of 23 dimensional log Mel filter bank features were concatenated to form a 713–dimensional super vector; Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) was applied to this super vector to de–correlate and compress it to 368 dimensions and then fed into the neural network. The network was trained on 4,000 triphone state targets and the 26 dimensional bottleneck layer was placed before the output layer. The objective function used for training was frame–level cross–entropy and the optimisation was performed with stochastic gradient descent using the backpropagation algorithm. DNN training was performed with the TNet toolkit [30] and more details can be found at [31]. For both types of features, MLE–based GMM– HMM models were trained using HTK [32] with 5–state crossword triphones and 16 gaussians per state. The language model was based on a 50,000–word vocabulary and was trained by combination of component language models for each of the 6 domains. The interpolation weights were tuned using an independent development set."

These results show the large variety in performance among domains, from 17–18% for read speech and radio broadcasts to 51% for television broadcasts. The use of DNN front–ends provides a 25% relative improvement in performance against PLP features; which is consistent across domains and follows results previously seen in the literature [33]."

      "heading" : "5.1. Evaluation of negative transfer",
      "text" : "Six different domain–dependent MLE models were trained from the 10 hours of training data for each domain (in all of the experiments PLP features were used, unless stated otherwise). Each of these models was then used to decode the complete test set. The results in Table 2 show that in–domain results (when the train and test data match based on manually labelled domains) are not greatly different from those obtained with a model trained on 60–hour training set. Instead, cross–domain scores (train and test are mismatched) result in considerable performance decreases everywhere.\nA second set of experiments was performed with models trained on 20 hours of data, using data from every possible pair of domains, for a total of 30 new acoustic models. Figure 1 shows the results in terms of relative improvement and degradation over the results of the 10–hour in–domain models. The rows of Figure 1 represent the testing domain and the columns represent the domain that was added in training to the data of the domain of the row. Positive values (blue squares) mark the existence of positive transfer, such as adding TV data to Radio data (7% improvement) or adding Radio data to Lecture data (4% improvement). But negative values (red squares) mark negative transfer, like adding Telephone data to Read speech (16% loss) or adding Read speech to Lecture data (5% loss).\nThese results showed that positive and negative transfer occurred across domains, possibly due to similarities and differences in speech styles, acoustic channels and background conditions. However a rule–based optimisation of the best model for each target domain would require a complex and error–prone\nprocess. The next experiments aimed to evaluate how an automatic selection of training could exploit positive transfer, while restricting negative transfer."

      "heading" : "5.2. Data selection based on budget",
      "text" : "The data selection technique proposed in Section 3 was evaluated next. For each of the six target test domains, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) with 512 mixtures were trained (Θtgt1:6 ), and a background 512–mixture GMM (ΘΩ) was trained from the complete training set of 60 hours. These GMMs were used to calculate the LR value for each training utterance (LR(O)) in order select the training data according to the acoustic similarity.\nThe first evaluation was performed using data selection based on budget. Five possible budgets of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 hours were designed for each test domain and the respective training data was chosen using the fLR(S) submodular function. Figure 2 shows relative improvement for each domain and budget against the results with the 60–hour model. The graphs show that all domains improve performance as the budget increases until a certain limit is reached, then negative transfer decreases the performance, converging to the WER achieved with the 60–hour trained model.\nIn order to observe which types of data were selected for each domain with the different budgets, Figure 3 presents the percentage of training data selected for each test domain with a 10–hour budget. While the majority of the data was chosen\nfrom the same domain, some cross–domain data was also selected, indicating positive transfer between domains. This occurred, for instance, with TV and Read speech data towards Radio data; and Lecture data towards TV data."

      "heading" : "5.3. Automatic decision on budget",
      "text" : "An issue that can arise with the evaluated budget–based proposal is the fact that a decision on a budget has to be made, and as the results in Figure 2 suggest, the optimal budget varies across different domains. A method for deciding a budget for a given target domain was proposed by selecting only utterances whose likelihood–ratio is above a threshold defined as the mean of the highest–weighted mixture of a GMM fitted to the distribution of likelihood ratios. The use of the mixture with the highest weight avoids the influence of outliers in the distribution of the LR values.\nThe experiments with an automatic budget decistion were performed for both types of features, PLP and PLP+BN. Table 3 presents the results for these experiments and compares them to the outcome of data selection based on a 30–hour budget, which was the best fixed budget from Figure 2. The results showed that the use of an automatically derived threshold improved the results obtained with a fixed budget for both types of features, indicating that the proposed method could estimate the right amount of data to select for each target domain.\nThe amount of data selected for each domain is presented in Table 4. This Table shows how Read speech and Conversational Telephone speech are the ones which benefited from a lower amount of training data (20 hours or less), while the rest of the domains preferred more data (from 30 to 40 hours). These values were consistent with the patterns of positive and negative transfer observed in Figure 2."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, the effect of positive and negative transfer across widely diverse domains in ASR was explored. We confirmed that the use of more data in MLE–based acoustic models does not always provide increases in performance. A submodular function based on Likelihood Ratio was proposed and used to perform an informed and efficient selection of data for different target test sets. The evaluation of selection techniques based on budget and on automatic budget decision has achieved gains of 4% over a 60–hour MLE model for PLP features and 2% for PLP+BN features.\nPrevious works have shown that data selection techniques can result in data sets biased towards specific groups of phones or triphones [19]. A phonetic analysis of the data sets given by the likelihood ratio function used in this paper did not show any bias on phones in these data sets. The 60–hour training data used in this work was well balanced phonetically which limited the risk of phonetic biases in the selected data. In situations where the original training data might present less well distributed phonetic content, the proposed function should be complemented by a function that takes into account the resulting phone distribution of the data.\nFuture work should explore similar data selection techniques for other training criteria besides MLE. The presented methods are based on LR and hence well–suited for MLE, but other submodular functions will be required to cater for needs given by discriminative objective functions such as Minimum Phone Error training. Further work should also investigate data selection techniques for datasets larger than the one studied here, and in completely mismatched conditions and using different features that better describe the background’s acoustic characteristics [34].\nThe technique presented in this paper can be used for building targeted models for “found speech data”. The ability of using very diverse data sets to transcribe newly found sets of speech recorded in unknown conditions is especially necessary to deal with this type of data. Other tasks, such as the automatic transcription of multi–genre media archives might also potentially benefit from the advances achieved in this work."

This paper proposes a novel technique to overcome negative transfer by efficient selection of speech data for acoustic model training. Here data is chosen on relevance for a specific target. A submodular function based on likelihood ratios is used to determine how acoustically similar each training utterance is to a target test set. The approach is evaluated on a wide–domain data set, covering speech from radio and TV broadcasts, telephone conversations, meetings, lectures and read speech. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique both finds relevant data and limits negative transfer. Results on a 6–hour test set show a relative improvement of 4% with data selection over using all data in PLP based models, and 2% with DNN features.",
