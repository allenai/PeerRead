      "text" : "Large-scale learning problems require algorithms that scale benignly (e.g. sub-linearly) with the size of the dataset and the number of trainable parameters. This has lead to a recent resurgence of interest in stochastic gradient descent methods (SGD). Besides fast convergence, SGD has sometimes been observed to yield significantly better generalization errors than batch methods [1].\nIn practice, getting good performance with SGD requires some manual adjustment of the initial value of the learning rate (or step size) for each model and each problem, as well as the design of an annealing schedule for stationary data. The problem is particularly acute for non-stationary data.\nThe contribution of this paper is a novel method to automatically adjust learning rates (possibly different learning rates for different parameters), so as to minimize some estimate of the expectation of the loss at any one time.\nStarting from an idealized scenario where every sample’s contribution to the loss is quadratic and separable, we derive a formula for the optimal learning rates for SGD, based on estimates of the variance of the gradient. The formula has two components: one that captures variability across samples, and one that captures the local curvature, both of which can be estimated in practice. The method can be used to derive a single common learning rate, or local learning rates for each parameter, or each block of parameters, leading to five variations of the basic algorithm, none of which need any parameter tuning.\nThe performance of the methods obtained without any manual tuning are reported on a variety of convex and non-convex learning models and tasks. They compare favorably with an “ideal SGD”, where the best possible learning rate was obtained through systematic search."

      "text" : "SGD methods have a long history in adaptive signal processing, neural networks, and machine learning, with an extensive literature (see [2, 1] for recent reviews). While the practical advantages of SGD for machine learning applications have been known for a long time [3], interest in SGD has increased in recent years due to the ever-increasing amounts of streaming data, to theoretical optimality results for generalization error [4], and to competitions being won by SGD methods, such as the PASCAL Large Scale Learning Challenge [5], where Quasi-Newton approximation of\nar X\niv :1\n20 6.\n11 06\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 6\nJ un\n2 01\nthe Hessian was used within SGD. Still, practitioners need to deal with a sensitive hyper-parameter tuning phase to get top performance: each of the PASCAL tasks used very different parameter settings. This tuning is very costly, as every parameter setting is typically tested over multiple epochs.\nLearning rates in SGD are generally decreased according a schedule of the form η(t) = η0(1 + γt)−1. Originally proposed as η(t) = O(t−1) in [6], this form was recently analysed in [7, 8] from a non-asymptotic perspective to understand how hyper-parameters like η0 and γ affect the convergence speed.\nThe main contribution of the present paper is a formula that gives the value of the learning rate that will maximally decrease the expected loss after the next update. For efficiency reasons, some terms in the formula must be approximated using such quantities as the mean and variance of the gradient. As a result, the learning rate is automatically decreased to zero when approaching an optimum of the loss, without requiring a pre-determined annealing schedule."

We show that using this learning rate schedule preserves convergence guarantees of SGD. We then find how the optimal learning rate values can be estimated from available information, and describe a couple of possible approximations.\nThe samples, indexed by j, are drawn i.i.d. from a data distribution P . Each sample contributes a per-sample loss L(j)(θ) to the expected loss:\nJ (θ) = Ej∼P [ L(j)(θ) ] (1)\nwhere θ ∈ Rd is the trainable parameter vector, whose optimal value is denoted θ∗ = argminθ J (θ). The SGD parameter update formula is of the form θ(t+1) = θ(t) − η(t)∇(j)θ , where ∇(j)θ = ∂ ∂θL\n(j)(θ) is the gradient of the the contribution of example j to the loss, and the learning rate η(t) is a suitably chosen sequence of positive scalars (or positive definite matrices)."

We also assume that the minimum value of the per-sample loss functions are zero:\nL(j)(θ) = 1 2\n( θ − c(j) )> H(j) ( θ − c(j) ) +Q(j) ; ∇(j)θ = H (j) ( θ − c(j) ) (2)\nwhere Hi is the (positive semi-definite) Hessian matrix of the per-sample loss of sample j, and c(j) is the optimum for that sample. The distribution of per-sample optima c(j) has mean θ∗ and variance Σ. Figure 1 illustrates the scenario in one dimension.\nTo simplify the analysis, we assume for the remainder of this section that the Hessians of the persample losses are identical for all samples, and that the problem is separable, i.e., the Hessians\nare diagonal, with diagonal terms denoted {h1, . . . , hi, . . . , hd}. Further, we will ignore the offdiagonal terms of Σ, with and denote the diagonal {σ21 , . . . , σ2i , . . . , σ2d}. Then, for any of the d dimensions, we thus obtain a one-dimensional problem (all indices i omitted).\nJ(θ) = Ei∼P [ 1\n2 h(θ − c(j))2\n] = 1 2 h [ (θ − θ∗)2 + σ2 ] (3)\nThe gradient components are∇(j)θ = h ( θ − c(j) ) , with\nE[∇θ] = h(θ − θ∗) V ar[∇θ] = h2σ2 (4)\nand we can rewrite the SGD update equation as θ(t+1) = θ(t) − ηh ( θ(t) − c(j) ) = (1− ηh)θ(t) + ηhθ∗ + ηhσξ(j) (5)\nwhere the ξ(j) are i.i.d. samples from a zero-mean and unit-variance Gaussian distribution. Inserting this into equation 3, we obtain the expected loss after an SGD update\nE [ J ( θ(t+1) ) | θ(t) ] = 1 2 h · [ (1− ηh)2(θ(t) − θ∗)2 + η2h2σ2 + σ2 ] We can now derive the optimal (greedy) learning rates for the current time t as the value η∗(t) that minimizes the expected loss after the next update\nη∗(t) = argmin η\n[ (1− ηh)2(θ(t) − θ∗)2 + σ2 + η2h2σ2 ] (6)\nη∗(t) = argmin η\n[ η2 ( h(θ(t) − θ∗)2 + hσ2 ) − 2η(θ(t) − θ∗)2 ] = 1\nh · (θ\n(t) − θ∗)2\n(θ(t) − θ∗)2 + σ2 (7)\nIn the classical (noiseless or batch) derivation of the optimal learning rate, the best value is simply η∗(t) = h−1. The above formula inserts a corrective term that reduces the learning rate whenever the sample pulls the parameter vector in different directions, as measured by the gradient variance σ2. The reduction of the learning rate is larger near an optimum, when (θ(t) − θ∗)2 is small relative to σ2. In effect, this will reduce the expected error due to the noise in the gradient. Overall, this will have the same effect as the usual method of progressively decreasing the learning rate as we get closer to the optimum, but it makes this annealing schedule automatic."

We are to prove that almost surely J∞ = J(θ∗) = 12hσ 2. Observe that\nJ(θ(t))− E[J(θ(t+1)) | θ(t)] = 1 2 hη∗(t) , and E[J(θ(t))]− E[J(θ(t+1)) | θ(t)] = 1 2 hE[η∗(t)]\nSince E[J(θ(t))] is bounded below by 0, the telescoping sum gives us E[η∗(t)] → 0, which in turn implies that in probability η∗(t)→ 0.

Of course, no fixed learning rate or fixed cooling schedule can achieve this. Figure 3 illustrates how vSGD with its adaptive memory-size appropriately handles such cases. Its initially large learning rate allows it to quickly approach the optimum, then it gradually reduces the learning rate as the gradient variance increases relative to the square norm of the average gradient, thus allowing the parameter to continually approach the optimum. When the data distribution changes abruptly, the algorithm automatically detects that the norm of the average gradient increases relative to the variance.

The architectures tested include logistic regression (MNIST-1C, CIFAR-1C), which are convex in the parameters, and fully-connected multi-layer neural nets with 2 and 3 layers (-2C and -3C). These architectures used the tanh non-linearity for hidden units, and were trained with the cross-entropy loss. The loss is non-convex in the parameters for the multi-layer architectures. The last experiment consisted of training a narrow auto-encoder with a single hidden layer, trained to minimize the square reconstruction error (CIFAR-2R.\nFor all experiments, the training data were normalized to have mean zero in each input dimension. Experiments were repeated with 10 random initializations of the weights [13] and stopped after 6 epochs (see Table 1).\nIn Table 2 and Table 3, we compare the best SGD with our vSGD variants. vSGD-lu (local gradient variance, upper bound on diagonal Hessian) seems to be good in ’shallow’ network like MNIST1C,CIFAR-1/2C. But for more challenging architectures, such as CIFAR-2R, vSGD-bb (layers and biases in different blocks) produces better results. However, on MNIST-3C vSGD-bb does not perform as good as expected. The issue was traced over-fitting due to the large size of the network, the relatively small size of the training set, and the absence of regularization term. A separate set of experiments were carried out with L2 regularizations on the parameters. Figure 4, shows the learning curves of two runs with an L2 regularizer λ2 ||θ|| 2 2.

      "text" : "Starting from the idealized case of quadratic loss contributions from each sample, we derived a method to compute an optimal learning rate at each update, and (possibly) for each parameter, that optimizes the expected loss after the next update. The method relies on the square norm of the expectation of the gradient, and the expectation of the square norm of the gradient. A proof of the conversion in probability is given. We showed different ways of approximating those learning rates in linear time and space in practice. The experimental results confirm the theoretical prediction: the adaptive learning rate method completely eliminates the need for manual tuning of the learning rate, or for systematic search of its best value.\nIn a set of experiments (not included from this paper for lack of space), the method proved very effective when used in on-line training scenarios with non-stationary signals. The adaptive learning rate automatically increases when the distribution changes, so as to adjust the model to the new distribution, and automatically decreases in stable periods when the system fine-tunes itself within an attractor."

We propose a method to automatically adjust multiple learning rates so as to minimize the expected error at any one time. The method relies on local gradient variations across samples. Using a number of convex and non-convex learning tasks, we show that the resulting algorithm matches the performance of the best settings obtained through systematic search, and effectively removes the need for learning rate tuning.",
