      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "One of the crucial steps toward understanding natural languages is mention detection (MD), whose goal is to identify entity mentions, whether named, nominal (the president) or pronominal (he, she), and classify them into some predefined types of interest in text such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION or LOCATION. This is an extension of the named entity recognition (NER) task which only aims to extract entity names. MD is necessary for many higher-level applications such as relation extraction, knowledge population, information retrieval, question answering and so on.\n∗Work carried out during an internship at IBM\nTraditionally, both MD and NER are formalized as sequential labeling problems, thereby being solved by some linear graphical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Maximum Entropy Markov Models (MEMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Although these graphical models have been adopted well to achieve the top performance for MD, there are still at least three problems we want to focus in this work:\n(i) The first problem is the performance loss of the mention detectors when they are trained on some domain (the source domain) and applied to other domains (the target domains). The problem might originate from various mismatches between the source and the target domains (domain shifts) such as the vocabulary difference, the distribution mismatches etc (Blitzer et al., 2006; Daume, 2007; Plank and Moschitti, 2013).\n(ii) Second, in mention detection, we might need to capture a long context, possibly covering the whole sentence, to correctly predict the type for a word. For instance, consider the following sentence with the pronominal “they”:\nNow, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war is because they have suffered much from the past war.\nIn this sentence, the correct type GPE1 for “they” can only be inferred from its GPE references: “France”, “Russia” and “Germany” which are far way from the pronominal “they” of interest. The challenge is come up with the models that can encode and utilize these long-range dependency context effectively.\n(iii) The third challenge is to be able to quickly adapt the current techniques for MD so that they can perform well on new languages.\nIn this paper, we propose to address these problems for MD via recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which offer a decent recurrent mechanism to embed the sentence context into a dis-\n1Geographical Political Entity\ntributed representation and employ it to decode the sentences. Besides, as RNNs replace the symbolic forms of words in the sentences with their word embeddings, the distributed representation that captures the general syntactic and semantic properties of words (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2008; Turian et al., 2010), they can alleviate the lexical sparsity, induce more general feature representation, thus generalizing well across domains (Nguyen and Grishman, 2015b). This also helps RNNs to quickly and effectively adapt to new languages which just require word embeddings as the only new knowledge we need to obtain. Finally, we can achieve the task-specific word embeddings for MD to improve the overall performance by updating the initial pre-trained word embeddings during the course of training in RNNs.\nThe recent emerging interest in deep learning has produced many successful applications of RNNs for NLP problems such as machine translation (Cho et al., 2014a; Bahdanau et al., 2015), semantic role labeling (Zhou and Xu, 2015) etc. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous work employing RNNs for MD on the cross-domain and language settings so far. To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follow:\n1. We perform a systematic investigation on various RNN architectures and word embedding techniques that are motivated from linguistic observations for MD.\n2. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance for MD both in the general setting and in the crossdomain setting with the bidirectional modeling applied to RNNs.\n3. We demonstrate the portability of the RNN models for MD to new languages by their significant improvement with large margins over the best reported system for named entity recognition in Dutch."

The previous work on MD has examined the cascade models (Florian et al., 2006), transferred knowledge from rich-resource languages to low-resource ones via machine translation (Zitouni and Florian, 2008) or improved the systems on noisy input (Florian et al., 2010). Besides, some recent work also tries to solve MD jointly with other tasks such as relation or event extraction to benefit from their inter-dependencies (Roth and Yih, 2007; Kate and Mooney, 2010; Li and Ji, 2014a; Li et al., 2014b). However, none of these work investigates RNNs for MD on the cross-domain and language settings as we do in this paper.\nRegarding neural networks, a large volume of work has devoted to the application of deep learning to NLP in the last few years, centering around several network architecture such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Yih et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015a; dos Santos and Guimarães, 2015b), recurrent/recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2014a; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Zhou and Xu, 2015; Tai et al., 2015), to name a few. For NER, Collobert et al. (2011) propose a CNN-based framework while Mesnil et al. (2013) and Yao et al. (2013; 2014) investigate the RNNs for the slot filling problem in spoken language understanding. Although our work also examines the RNNs, we consider the mention detection problem with an emphasis on the robustness of the models in the domain shifts and language changes which has never been explored in the literature before.\nFinally, for the robustness in the domain adaptation setting, the early work has focused on the sequential labeling tasks such as part-of-speech tagging or name tagging (Blitzer et al., 2006; Huang and Yates, 2010; Daume, 2007; Xiao and Guo, 2013; Schnabel and Schütze, 2014). Recent work has drawn attention to relation extraction (Plank and Moschitti, 2013; Nguyen et al., 2015a; Gormley et al., 2015). In the field of neural networks, to the best of our knowledge, there is only one work from Nguyen and Grishman (2015b) that evaluates CNNs for event detection in the cross-domain setting."

Given a sentence X = w1w2 . . . wn, where wi is the i-th word and n is the length of the sentence, we want to predict the label sequence Y = y1y2 . . . yn for X, where yi is the label for wi. The labels yi follow the BIO2 encoding to capture the entity mentions in X (Ratinov and Roth, 2009).\nIn order to prepare the sentence for RNNs, we first transform each word wi into a real-valued vector using the concatenation of two vectors ei and fi: wi = [ei, fi]2, where:\n• ei is the word embedding vector of wi, obtained by training a language model on a large corpus (discussed later).\n• fi is a binary vector encompassing different features for wi. In this work, we are utilizing four types of features: capitalization, gazetteers, triggers (whether wi is present in a list of trigger words3 or not) and cache (the label that is assigned to wi sometime before in the document).\nWe then enrich this vector representation by including the word vectors in a context window of vc for each word in the sentence to capture the short-term dependencies for prediction (Mesnil et al., 2013). This effectively converts wi into the context window version of the concatenated vectors: xi = [wi−vc , . . . , wi, . . . , wi+vc ].\nGiven the new input representation, we describe the RNNs to be investigated in this work below."

The output vector oi is the probabilistic distribution over the possible labels for the word xi and obtained from hi via the softmax function ϕ:\noi = ϕ(Whi), ϕ(zm) = ezm\n∑ k e zk\n2For simplicity, we are using the word wi and its realvalued vector representation interchangeably.\n3Trigger words are the words that are often followed by entity names in sentences such as “president”, “Mr.” etc.\nRegarding the hidden vectors or units hi, there are two major methods to obtain them from the current input and the last hidden and output vectors, leading to two different RNN variants:\n• In the Elman model (Elman, 1990), called ELMAN, the hidden vector from the previous step hi−1, along with the input in the current step xi, constitute the inputs to compute the current hidden state hi:\nhi = Φ(Uxi + V hi−1) (1)\n• In the Jordan model (Jordan, 1986), called JORDAN, the output vector from the previous step oi−1 is fed into the current hidden layer rather than the hidden vector from the previous steps hi−1. The rationale in this topology is to introduce the label from the preceding step as a feature for current prediction:\nhi = Φ(Uxi + V oi−1) (2)\nIn the formula above, Φ is the sigmoid activation function: Φ(z) = 1\n1+e−z and W , U , V are\nthe same weight matrices for all time steps, to be learned during training. The unfolded dependency graphs for the two models are given in Figure 1."

      "text" : "The hidden units in the two basic models above are essentially the standard feed-forward neural networks that take the vectors hi−1, oi−1 and xi as inputs and do a linear transformation followed by a nonlinearity to generate the hidden vector hi. The ELMAN and JORDAN models are then basically a stack of these hidden units. Unfortunately, this staking mechanism causes the so-called “vanishing gradient” and “exploding gradient” problems (Bengio et al., 1994), making it challenging to train the networks properly in practice (Pascanu et al., 2012). These problems are addressed by the long-short term memory units (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Graves et al., 2009) that propose the idea of memory cells with four gates to allow the information storage and access over a long period of time.\nIn this work, we apply another version of memory units with only two gates (reset and update), called Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) from Cho et al. (2014a; 2015). GRU is shown to be much simpler than LSTM in terms of computation and implementation but still achieves the\ncomparable performance in machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015).\nThe introduction of GRUs into the models ELMAN and JORDAN amounts to two new models, named ELMAN_GRU and JORDAN_GRU respectively, with two new methods to compute the hidden vectors hi. The formula for ELMAN_GRU is adopted directly from Cho et al. (2014b) and given below:\nhi = zi ⊙ ĥi + (1− zi)⊙ hi−1\nĥi = Φ(Whxi + Uh(ri ⊙ hi−1))\nzi = Φ(Wzxi + Uzhi−1) (3)\nri = Φ(Wrxi + Urhi−1)\nwhere Wh,Wz,Wr ∈ RH×I , Uh, Uz, Ur ∈ R\nH×H and ⊙ is the element-wise multiplication operation.\nWe cannot directly apply the formula above to the JORDAN_GRU model since the dimensions of the output vectors oi and the hidden vector hi are different in general. For JORDAN_GRU, we first need to transform the output vector oi into the hidden vector space, leading to the following formula:\nhi = zi ⊙ ôi + (1− zi)⊙ ti−1\nti−1 = Toi−1\nôi = Φ(Woxi + Uo(ri ⊙ ti−1))\nzi = Φ(Wzxi + Uzti−1) (4)\nri = Φ(Wrxi + Urti−1)\nwhere T ∈ RH×O."

The same implication applies for the Jordan models.\nagain, Re and Rd can be any model in {ELMAN, JORDAN, ELMAN_GRU, JORDAN_GRU}.\nThe observation is, at the time step i, the forward hidden vector li represents the encoding for the past word context (from position 1 to i) while the backward hidden vector ri is the summary for the future word context (from position n to i). Consequently, the concatenated vector αi = [li, ri] constitutes a distributed representation that is specific to the word at position i but still encapsulates the context information over the whole sentence at the same time. This effectively provides the networks a much richer representation to decode the sentence. The bidirectional network for Re = ELMAN and Rd = JORDAN is given on the left of Figure 2.\nWe notice that Mesnil et al. (2013) also investigate the bidirectional models for the task of slot filling in spoken language understanding. However, compared to the work presented here, Mesnil et al. (2013) does not use any special transition memory cells (like the GRUs we are employing in this paper) to avoid numerical stability issues (Pascanu et al., 2012). Besides, they form the inputs α for the decoding phase from a larger context of the forward and backward encoding outputs, while performing word-wise, independent classification; in contrast, we use only the current output vectors in the forward and backward encodings for α, but perform recursive computations to decode the sentence via the RNN model Rd (demonstrated on the right of Figure 2)."

The last vector in this output sequence corresponds to the probabilistic label distribution for the current position i, to be used to compute the objective function. For example, in the bidirectional models, the input sequence for the decoding phase is αi−vdαi−vd+1 . . . αi while the output sequence is: Re(αi−vdαi−vd+1 . . . αi) = oi−vdoi−vd+1 . . . oi.\nIn this work, we employ the stochastic gradient descent algorithm5 to update the parameters via minimizing the negative log-likelihood objective function: nll(E) = − log(oi[yi]).\nFinally, besides the weight matrices in the networks, the word embeddings are also optimized during training to obtain the task-specific word embeddings for MD.

(2013a; 2013b) that introduce two log-linear models, i.e the continuous bag-of-words model (CBOW) and the continuous skip-gram model (Skip-gram). The CBOW model attempts to predict the current word based on the average of the context word vectors while the Skip-gram model aims to predict the surrounding words in a sentence given the current word. In this work, besides the CBOW and skip-gram models, we examine a concatenation-based variant of CBOW (C-CONCAT) to train word embeddings and compare the three models to gain insights into which kind of model is effective to obtain word representations for the MD task. The objective of C-CONCAT is to predict the target word using the concatenation of the vectors of the words surrounding it, motivated from our strategy to decide the label for a word based on the concatenated context vectors. Intuitively, the C-CONCAT model would perform better than CBOW due to the close relatedness between the decoding strategies of C-CONCAT and the MD methods.

First, our MEMM system is already better than the state-of-the-art system on this dataset, possibly due to the superiority of the features we are em-\n10We tried the CRF model, but it is worse than MEMM in our case.\n11We notice that the four features we are using in the RNN models (Section 3) are also included in the feature set of the implemented MEMM system.\nploying in this system. Consequently, from now on, we would utilize this MEMM system as the baseline in the following experiments. Second, all the three RNN systems: BASIC, CONTEXT and BIDIRECT substantially outperform the stateof-the-art system with large margins. In fact, we achieve the best performance on this dataset with the BIDIRECT model, once again testifying to the benefit of bidirectional modeling for MD."

On the CoNLL 2003 dataset for English NER, the best neural network system so far is Collobert et al. (2011). This system, called CNN-Sentence, employs convolutional neural networks to encode the sentences and then decodes it at the sentence level. Table 8 shows the performance of CNN-Sentence and our RNN systems on this dataset.\nAs we can see from the table, the RNN systems are on par with the CNN-Sentence system from Collobert et al. (2011) except the CONTEXT system that is worse in this case. We actually accomplish the best performance with the BIDIRECT model, thus further demonstrating its virtue."

      "heading" : "5.6 Cross-Domain Experiments",
      "text" : "One of the main problems we want to address in this work is the robustness across domains of the MD systems. This section tests the MEMM (the baseline) and the RNN systems on the cross-domain settings to gain an insights into their operation when the domain changes. In particular, for the first experiment, following the previous work of domain adaptation on the ACE 2005 dataset (Plank and Moschitti, 2013; Nguyen and Grishman, 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015a), we treat news as the source domain and the other domains: bc, cts, wl and un as the target domains. We then examine the systems on two scenarios: (i) the systems are trained and tested on the source domain via 5-fold cross validation (in-domain performance), and\n(ii) the systems are trained on the source domain but evaluated on the target domains. Besides, in order to understand the effect of the features on the systems, we report the systems’ performance in both the inclusion and exclusion of the features described in Section 3. Table 9 presents the results.\nTo summarize, we find that the RNN systems significantly outperform the MEMM system across all the target domains when the features are not applied. The BIDIRECT system still yields the best performance among systems being investigated (except in domain bc). This is also the case in the inclusion of features and demonstrates the robustness of the BIDIRECT model in the domain shifts. We further support this result in Table 10 where we report the performance of the MEMM and BIDIRECT systems (with features) on different domain assignments for the source and the target domains. Finally, we also see that the features are very useful for both the MEMM and the RNNs."

In this section, we want to explores the capacity of the systems to quickly and effectively adapt to a new language. In particular, we evaluate the systems on the named entity recognition task (the simplified version of the MD task) for Dutch using the CoNLL 2002 dataset. The state-of-the-art performance for this dataset is due to Carreras et al. (2002) in the CoNLL 2002 evaluation and Nothman et al. (2013). Very recently, while we were preparing this paper, Gillick el al. (2015) introduce a multilingual language processing system and also report the performance\non this dataset. Table 11 compares the systems.\nNote that the systems in Gillick el al. (2015) are also based on RNNs and the row labeled with * for Gillick el al. (2015) corresponds to the system trained on multiple datasets instead of the single CoNLL dataset for Dutch, so not being comparable to ours.\nThe most important conclusion from the table is that the RNN models in this work significantly outperform MEMM as well as the other comparable system by large margins (up to 22% reduction in relative error). This proves that the proposed RNN systems are less subject to the language changes than MEMM and the other systems. Finally, BIDIRECT is also significantly better than BASIC, testifying to its robustness across languages."

The comparison between the RNN models and the state-of-the-art systems in the literature reveals the strong promise of the RNN models. In particular, the bidirectional model achieves the best performance in the general setting (up to 9% reduction in relative error) and outperforms\na very strong baseline of the feature-based exponential models in the cross-domain setting, thus demonstrating its robustness across domains. We also show that the RNN models are more portable to new languages as they are significantly better than the best reported systems for NER in Dutch (up to 22% reduction in relative error). In the future, we plan to apply the bidirectional modeling technique to other tasks as well as study the combination of different network architectures and resources to further improve the performance of the systems."

    "abstractText" : "One of the key challenges in natural language processing (NLP) is to yield good performance across application domains and languages. In this work, we investigate the robustness of the mention detection systems, one of the fundamental tasks in information extraction, via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The advantage of RNNs over the traditional approaches is their capacity to capture long ranges of context and implicitly adapt the word embeddings, trained on a large corpus, into a task-specific word representation, but still preserve the original semantic generalization to be helpful across domains. Our systematic evaluation for RNN architectures demonstrates that RNNs not only outperform the best reported systems (up to 9% relative error reduction) in the general setting but also achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the cross-domain setting for English. Regarding other languages, RNNs are significantly better than the traditional methods on the similar task of named entity recognition for Dutch (up to 22% relative error reduction).",
