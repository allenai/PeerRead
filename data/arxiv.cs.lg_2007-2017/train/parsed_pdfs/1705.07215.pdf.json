      "text" : "Generative modeling involves using a training set to learn probability distribution Pmodel that closely resembles the data generating distribution Preal. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [9] are a class of implicit generative models that have achieved significant success in generating realistic samples for high-dimensional data. GANs find applications in a variety of domains, including settings demanding multi-modal outputs, use within model-based reinforcement learning algorithms, and incorporation of unlabeled data in semi-supervised settings [13]. At its core, GAN training is framed as a zero-sum game between two players - a generator G and discriminator D. The goal is to reach equilibrium of this game where the Jenson-Shannon divergence between Pmodel and Preal is minimized. The common practice in the community is to use simultaneous gradient descent to try and converge to this point. However, this procedure lacks a clear game theoretical justification from the literature and in fact, the original paper argues that ideally players should be trained to optimality at each step.\nIn this paper, we introduce regret-minimization (RM) [7, 6] as a technique to reach Nash Equilibrium in games. Leveraging the analysis of no-regret algorithms (specifically, online gradient descent [4])\n∗Submitted to NIPS’17.

Further, we hypothesize that the difficulty in training GANs, especially due to mode collapse, results from the existence of spurious local Nash Equilibria in non-convex games [8]. To address this problem, we propose a new algorithm (DRAGAN) that performs smoothing of the discriminator function by constraining its gradients around the real samples. Finally, we present a series of experiments to support our claims and demonstrate stable, competitive performance of DRAGAN in a wide variety of settings. We show results on the MNIST, CIFAR, and CelebA datasets."

      "text" : "There have been a lot of works aimed at finding a stable way to train GANs. Radford et al. [11] proposed a stable family of architectures called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs). We show that such constraints on architectures can be relaxed while still being able to achieve stability in the training process. In an alternate direction, a number of works have focused on developing specific objective functions that improve stability and performance of GANs. Salimans et al. [16] introduced a variety of techniques to improve the quality of samples. Che et.al [12] proposed a family of regularizers to address the missing modes problem in GANs. Zhao et.al [17] introduced energy based GAN framework which is more stable to train. Metz et al. [14] developed unrolled GANs taking inspiration from game theory literature. However, it suffers from slow performance due to the requirement of multiple unrolling steps in each iteration.\nRecently, we have seen a series of works based on imposing a Lipschitz constraint on the discriminator function. Guo-Jun Qi [20] introduced LS-GAN with the idea of maintaining a margin between losses assigned to real and fake samples. Specifically, they enforce the following condition (the discriminator is used as the loss function in this setting) -\nDθ(Gφ(z))−Dθ(x) ≥ ∆(x, Gφ(z)) where the ∆(.) is some distance metric. Further, they impose a Lipschitz constraint on both G and D using weight decay. This leads to D having non-vanishing gradients everywhere between all real and fake sample pairs in the limit. Arjovsky et al. [18] proposed Wasserstein GAN which uses Earth-Mover distance as the objective to address problems with the vanilla objective. Their procedure requires the discriminator to be a Lipschitz function and they use weight clipping to achieve that. Gulrajani et al. [19] proposed an extension to address various shortcomings of the original WGAN and they impose the following condition on D -\n||∇x̂Dθ(x̂)||2 ≈ 1\nwhere x̂ = (ǫ)x + (1 − ǫ)Gφ(z) is some point between randomly chosen real and fake sample pairs. This leads to D having norm 1 gradients everywhere between all real and fake sample pairs in the limit. Notice that this behavior is very similar to that of LSGAN’s discriminator function. We argue that such constraints are too restrictive and can encourage poor generator functions. This is demonstrated in section 4 where improved WGAN fails to accurately capture a simple data distribution. Additionally, the requirement of multiple updates to D at each step makes it slow. Our proposed method address a fundamental game theoretic issue in the GAN training process and hence it can be used on top of a variety of objective functions. We show that it is possible to get excellent results using just the vanilla objective function and a single update to D."

      "text" : "Given this background, we first describe our algorithm and then provide our theoretical motivation and justification for it in Section 4. Algorithm 1 shows pseudo-code for our proposed approach. We deviate from the vanilla algorithm in how we update the discriminator. Our proposed method involves constraining points in local regions around real examples to have norm 1 gradients. To achieve this, we generate three different mini-batches in each iteration: Real data examples from the training set xi, samples from the normal distribution zi, and real data examples perturbed with small noise xi + δi (the magnitude of noise decides the size of local regions). Ideally, we would like to be able to impose the constraint everywhere in these local regions but to keep it tractable, we only apply it at randomly chosen points (as shown in step 6). The objective function of D is appended with a regularization term that penalizes violations of the above constraint.\nAlgorithm 1 DRAGAN 1: Initial weights (φ0,θ0) (for the generator and descriminator, respectively) 2: for number of training iterations do 3: Get a mini-batch of real examples {x1, x2, ..., xm} from training data. 4: Get a mini-batch of samples {z1, z2, ..., zm} from N (0, 1) 5: Get {x1 + δ1, x2 + δ2, ..., xm + δm} where each δi is small noise vector. 6: Define x̂i = α · xi + (1− α) · (xi + δi) for random α ∈ U [0, 1] 7: Update the discriminator by descending its gradient (using Adam):\n8: ∇θ 1m ∑m i=1 [ − logDθ(xi)− log(1−Dθ(Gφ(zi))) + λ · (||∇x̂iDθ(x̂i)||2 − 1)2 ]\n9: Update the generator by descending its gradient (using Adam):\n10: ∇φ 1m ∑m i=1 log [ 1−Dθ(Gφ(zi)) ]\n11: end for\nWe now provide some implementation details for our algorithm:\nHyperparameters We use Adam [10] with default parameters everywhere.

      "text" : "In the present section we describe how the training procedure for GANs in general can be viewed through the lens of equilibrium computation in zero-sum convex/concave games. The simultaneous gradient descent procedure corresponds to regret minimization techniques which are well-studied in the online learning and game theory communities. We observe, of course, that the lack of convexity leads to multiple saddle points (Nash equilibria), but we argue that the existence of such non-optimal solutions can be mitigated by the appropriate smoothing of the payoff function via regularization. This idea was used by Nash himself in his early work [2]. We argue in favor of this hypothesis empirically in Section 5."

      "text" : "Von Neumann established the minimax theorem for zero-sum games in [1] or equivalently the existence of mixed Nash equilibria. Nash and von Neumann originally envisioned two players selecting probabililty distributions over a finite strategy set, and receiving randomized rewards according to the game payoff function and these distributions. The minimax theorem has been significantly generalized since this original formulation, and the work of Sion [3] provides a broad class of scenarios in which inf sup{} = sup inf{}. For example, when we are given convex and compact subsets or Θ ⊂ Rn and Φ ⊂ Rm and a function g : Θ× Φ→ R that is convex in its first argument and concave in its second, then Sion’s theorem implies that\nmin θ∈Θ max φ∈Φ g(θ, φ) = max φ∈Φ min θ∈Θ g(θ, φ).\nFor such min/max optimization scenarios, we will use the term Nash equilibrium pair to refer to any θ∗, φ∗ such that θ∗ ∈ argminθ∈Θmaxφ∈Φ g(θ, φ) and φ∗ ∈ argmaxφ∈Φminθ∈Θ g(θ, φ). Many problems, including the development of GANs, can be posed as a min/max formulation and hence a natural question is how we can find such equilibrium pairs. The most straightforward procedure by which players might search for an equilibrium is best-response dynamics (BRD). In each round, best-responding players play their optimal strategy given their opponent’s current strategy. Despite its simplicity, BRD does not necessarily converge even in simple convex settings and can lead to oscillations/instability. At least in the setting where the payoff g(·, ·) is convex/concave, we have a technique that is both efficient and provably works: no-regret learning algorithms (See, e.g., Chapter 4 of [7]). If both players treat the selection of their strategy parameters θt, φt as a sequential game (t = 1, 2, . . .), and they update these parameters via no-regret dynamics, then it is easy to show that the time-average parameter vectors will converge to a Nash equilibrium pair.\nLet us recall the definition of a no-regret algorithm. Given a sequence of convex loss functions L1, L2, . . . : Θ→ R, an algorithm that selects a sequence of θt’s, each of which may only depend on previously observed L1, . . . , Lt−1, is said to have no regret if R(T ) T = o(1), where we define\nR(T ) := ∑T t=1 Lt(θt)−minθ∈Θ ∑T t=1 Lt(θ)\nWe apply no-regret learning to the problem of equilibrium finding in a game g(·, ·) as follows. The θ player imagines the function g(·, φt) as his loss function on round t, and similarly the φ player imagines −g(θt, ·) as her loss function at t. After T rounds of play, each player computes the average iterates θ̄T := 1T ∑T t=1 θt and φ̄T := 1 T ∑T t=1 φt. If V\n∗ is the equilibrium value of the game, and the θ and φ players suffer regret R1(T ) and R2(T ) respectively, then it is easy to show that\nV ∗ − R2(T )T ≤ maxφ∈Φ g(θ̄T , φ)− R2(T ) T ≤ minθ∈Θ g(θ, φ̄T ) + R1(T ) T ≤ V ∗ + R1(T ) T .\nIn other words, θ̄T and φ̄T are “almost optimal” solutions to the game, where the “almost” approximation factor is given by the average regret terms R1(T )+R2(T )T . Under the no-regret condition, the former will vanish, and hence we can guarantee convergence in the limit.\nLet us consider a specific family of no-regret algorithms, and in particular we look at the well-studied familiy [6] known as Follow The Regularized Leader (FTRL). Specifically, FTRL selects θt on round t by solving for argminθ∈Θ{ ∑t−1 s=1 Ls(θ) + 1 ηΩ(θ)}, where Ω(·) is some convex “regularization function” and η is a learning rate. Roughly speaking, if you select the regularization as Ω(·) = 12‖ ·‖2,\nthen FTRL becomes the well-known Online Gradient Descent (OGD) [4]. Ignoring the case of constraint violations, OGD can be written in a simple iterative form: θt = θt−1 − η∇Lt(θt−1). Of course the min/max objective function in GANs involves a stochastic payoff function, with two randomized inputs given on each round, x and z which are sampled from the data distribution and a standard multivariate normal, respectively. Let us write gx,z(θ, φ) := logDθ(x) + log(1 − Dθ(Gφ(z))). Taking expectations with respect to x and z we define the full (non-stochastic) game as g(θ, φ) = EzEx∼preal [gx,z(θ, φ)]. But the above online training procedure is still valid with stochastic inputs. That is, the equilibrium computation would proceed similarly, where on each round we sample xt and zt, and follow the updates\nθt+1 ← θt − η∇θgxt,zt(θt, φt) and φt+1 ← φt − η∇φgxt,zt(θt, φt).\nA huge benefit of this stochastic perspective is that we immediately get a generalization bound on the mean parameters θ̄T after T rounds of optimization. The celebrated “online-to-batch conversion” [5], now a standard result in online learning theory, implies that Ex,z[gx,z(θ̄T , φ)], for any φ, is no more than the optimal value Ex,z[gx,z(θ∗, φ)] plus an “estimation error” bounded by E [ R1(T )+R2(T )\nT\n] ,\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the sequence of samples observed along the way, and any randomness in the algorithm. (A limitation of this result, however, is that it requires a fresh sample xt to be used on every round.)"

      "text" : "The discussion above, and the very general results one can prove using no-regret techniques, still relies on the crucial assumption that the payoff function g(·, ·) is convex-concave. Indeed convexity is used in a number of places in the proofs: vanishing regret relies on a sequence of convex loss functions, and the online-to-batch conversion rests on Jensen’s inequality to show 1 T ∑T t=1 g(θt, φ) ≥ g ( 1 T ∑T t=1 θt, φ ) . However, due to the non-convex nature of GAN settings, we are not guaranteed that a sole Nash equilibrium exists – there may be many non-optimal saddle points, which are essentially local minima of the game. On the other hand, if the no-regret dynamics exhibits convergence of θ̄T and φ̄T to some fixed points θ̂ and φ̂, then at the very least we know this pair will be a saddle point, albeit potentially non-optimal. In the GAN literature, it has been widely observed that mode collapse is quite commonly observed in practice and has been attributed to the non-convex nature of the model.\nOne of the striking features of the experimental results presented herein is that mode collapse is significantly rarer under the modified game we have considered, and this feature of the optimization may be a significant contributor to our robust performance gains. The novel aspect of our algorithm is the additional penalization of the gradients in feature space, which is (roughly) λExE(δ∼N(0,ǫI)[‖∇xDθ(x+ δ)‖− 1)2]. This is, in effect, biasing the discriminator function to have norm-(≈ 1) gradients in a region around the real-data manifold. We recall an important fact, that any smooth function with norm-1 gradients on a compact set is necessarily a linear function, which suggests that our procedure encourages “close to linearity” at least along the data manifold. The space of linear functions, of course, forms a convex set and would therefore involve only a single global optimum. We believe the following conjecture accounts for the dramatic reduction in mode collapse: the local norm-1 gradient regularization penalty provides sufficient smoothing of the game payoff to significantly reduce the space of non-optimal saddle points. We present some experimental validation on MNIST that the penalty increases as we enter mode collapse events in supplementary Sections 2.1 and 2.2."

      "text" : "Several recent works have proposed regularized models of GANs to improve stability . Our proposed approach roughly falls under this class of models and specifically, improved WGAN is the closest related approach to ours. Despite being developed from completely different motivations (Wasserstein distance and game theory), both impose a similar form of constraint on the gradients of D(x). However, there are differences with important implications for generative modeling performance.\nThe most important distinction is that we only impose these constraints in local regions around real samples, while improved WGAN imposes them everywhere. We claim that the resulting class\nof functions that improved WGAN can model is highly restricted compared to our method. This can be demonstrated with a simple experiment. In Figure 1, we track the performance of vanilla GAN, improved Wasserstein GAN and our algorithm on the swissroll dataset2 over the training period. Observe that the vanilla algorithm quickly captures the data density, our algorithm captures it approximately but improved WGAN fails to accurately capture this distribution (we show another experiment with 8-Gaussians dataset in the supplementary Section 2.3). The experimental results in section 5.1 further support our claim.\nThe proposed regularization, which restricts the discriminator function only along the real-data manifold, allows for broader flexibility of Dθ(·) in the vastly larger region outside of true density. Indeed the natural image space is mostly empty, i.e. there are low probability regions between any two modes. Modes that are far away from each other (for instance images of cars vs animals) can be equally realistic and modes close to each other (for instance images of cats with four legs vs cats with three legs) can have very different probabilities of being real. Such variations in data density cannot be modeled accurately when norm 1 gradients are imposed everywhere.\nFigure 1: Comparing the performance of different algorithms on swissroll dataset - Vanilla GAN (top), Improved WGAN (middle), and our algorithm (bottom).

      "heading" : "5.2 BogoNet score to measure stability across architectures",
      "text" : "One of the key advantages of our algorithm is that it can achieve better stability in a wider range of architectures (other than DCGANs). Similar to [18, 19] we have removed stabilizing components of DCGAN and demonstrated improved reliability compared to the vanilla GAN algorithm (see Section 2.4 in supplementary). However, to measure this to a larger extent, we introduce a metric termed the BogoNet score to compare stability of different training procedures in the GAN setting. The basic idea is to choose random architectures for players G and D independently and evaluate the performance of different algorithms in the resulting games. A good algorithm should give stable performance without failing to learn or more importantly mode collapse despite the imbalances.\nIn our experiment, each player is assigned a network from a diverse pool of architectures from three families (MLP, ResNet, DCGAN). See Section 3 in supplementary for details. To demonstrate that our algorithm is more stable compared to the vanilla procedure, we created 150 such instances of hard games. For each instance, we trained using both the Vanilla and our algorithm for the CIFAR-10 dataset and plotted the inception score over time. We performed both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the resulting graphs to measure stability in the performance of both algorithms.\nFor qualitative analysis, we used a bounty model to assign scores to each algorithm. We used 50 of the total 150 instances generated for this analysis. Each instance is worth 5 points and we split this bounty between the two algorithms depending on their performance. If both perform well or perform poorly, they get 2.5 points each. However, if one algorithm achieves stable performance compared to the other (in terms of lack of learning or mode collapses), we assign it higher portions of the bounty. Results were judged by two of the authors in a blind manner: The curves were shown side-by-side with the choice of algorithm for each side being randomized and unlabeled. The Vanilla\nGAN received an average score of 92.5 while our algorithm achieved an average score of 157.5, demonstrating much better stability properties across a range of architectures.\nFor quantitative analysis, we used the remaining 100 instances. For each algorithm we calculated statistics of final inception scores and area under the curve (AUC) over all 100 instances. However, these statistics do not capture the notion of stability well. To alleviate this, we perform linear regression on the series of inception scores observed in each instance to capture the overall trend. Ideally, we want consistent increase in the inception score over time and this would indicate stable performance. This means the resulting linear fit should have a positive slope with high magnitude. We calculate statistics of this slope over all 100 instances. The results are shown below in Table 1.\nNotice that while the mean and y-intercept in the linear fit of both the algorithms is almost the same, the mean slope of inception score linear fits is 2.5 times higher for our algorithm. Clearly, this is the result of mitigating mode collapse and other stability issues. In some architectures, the vanilla algorithm does well but it goes into mode collapse in a lot of the cases. The average slop of linear fit captures this behavior well. Another way to interpret this is that given a random architecture, we are likely to get 2.5 times higher inception score, which is a non-trivial result. To summarize, both the qualitative and the quantitative analysis demonstrate that we achieve more stable performance compared to the vanilla procedure and solve stability issues to some extent."

The number and width of filters, latent space dimensionality are some other variations. Similarly, the number of layers and hidden units in each layer for MLP are chosen randomly. For\nResNets, we choose their depth randomly. This creates a set of hard games which test the stability of a given training algorithm."

The basic setup consists of two deep networks playing against each other in a zero-sum game setting. However, it is not understood if the networks reach an equilibrium eventually and what dynamics makes this possible. The current GAN training procedure, which involves simultaneous gradient descent, lacks a clear game-theoretic justification in the literature. In this paper, we introduce regret minimization as a technique to reach equilibrium in games and use this to motivate the use of simultaneous GD in GANs. In addition, we present a hypothesis that mode collapse, which is a common occurrence in GAN training, happens due to the existence of spurious local equilibria in non-convex games. Motivated by these insights, we develop an algorithm called DRAGAN that is fast, simple to implement and achieves competitive performance in a stable fashion across different architectures, datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CelebA), and divergence measures with almost no hyperparameter tuning.",
