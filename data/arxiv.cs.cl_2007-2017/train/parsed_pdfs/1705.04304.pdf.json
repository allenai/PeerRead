However, for longer documents and summaries, these models often include repetitive and incoherent phrases. We introduce a neural network model with intra-attention and a new training method. This method combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with the former often exhibit “exposure bias” – they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, a 5.7 absolute points improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. It also performs well as the first abstractive model on the New York Times corpus. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries."

      "text" : "Text summarization is the process of automatically generating natural language summaries from an input document while retaining the important points.\nBy condensing large quantities of information into short, informative summaries, summarization can aid many downstream applications such as\ncreating news digests, search, and report generation.\nThere are two prominent types of summarization algorithms. First, extractive summarization systems form summaries by copying parts of the input (Neto et al., 2002; Dorr et al., 2003). Second, abstractive summarization systems generate new phrases, possibly rephrasing or using words that were not in the original text (Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016).\nRecently, neural network models (Nallapati et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2016), based on the attentional encoder-decoder model for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), were able to generate abstractive summaries with high ROUGE scores. However, these systems have typically focused on summarizing short input sequences (one or two sentences) to generate even shorter summaries. For example, the summaries on the DUC-2004 dataset generated by the state-of-the-art system by Zeng et al. (2016) are limited to 75 characters.\nNallapati et al. (2016) also applied their abstractive summarization model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset (Hermann et al., 2015), which contains input sequences of up to 800 tokens and multi-sentence summaries of up to 100 tokens. The analysis by Nallapati et al. (2016) illustrate a key problem with attentional encoder-decoder models: they often generate unnatural summaries consisting of repeated phrases.\nWe present a new abstractive summarization model that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CNN/Daily Mail and similarly good results on the New York Times dataset (NYT) (Sandhaus, 2008). To our knowledge, this is the first model for abstractive summarization on the NYT dataset. We introduce a key attention mechanism and a new learning objective to address the repeating phrase problem: (i) we use an intra-temporal attention in\nthe encoder that records previous attention weights for each of the input tokens while a sequential intra-attention model in the decoder takes into account which words have already been generated by the decoder. (ii) we propose a new objective function by combining the maximum-likelihood cross-entropy loss used in prior work with rewards from policy gradient reinforcement learning to reduce exposure bias. We show that our model achieves 41.16 ROUGE-1 on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, an absolute improvement of 5.70 to the previous state-of-the-art result. Moreover, we show, through human evaluation of generated outputs, that our model generates more readable summaries compared to other techniques."

This kind of attention prevents the model from attending over the sames parts of the input on different decoding steps. Nallapati et al. (2016) have shown that such an intra-temporal attention can reduce the amount of repetitions when attending over long documents.\nWe define eti as the attention score of the hidden\ninput state hei at decoding time step t:\neti = f(h d t , h e i ), (1)\nwhere f can be any function returning a scalar eti from the hdt and h e i vectors. While some attention models use functions as simple as the dot-product between the two vectors, we choose to use a bilinear function:\nf(hdt , h e i ) = h d t T W eattnh e i .

To prevent that, we want to incorporate more information about the previously decoded sequence into the decoder. Looking back at previous decoding steps will allow our model to make more structured predictions and avoid repeating the same information, even if that information was generated many steps away. To achieve this, we introduce an intra-decoder attention mechanism. This mechanism is not present in current encoder-decoder models.\nFor each decoding step t, our model computes a new decoder context vector cdt . We set c d 1 to a vector of zeros since the generated sequence is empty on the first decoding step. For t > 1, we use the following equations:\nedtt′ = h d t T W dattnh d t′ (6)\nαdtt′ = exp(edtt′)\n∑t−1 j=1 exp(e d tj)\n(7)\ncdt =\nt−1 ∑\nj=1\nαdtjh d j (8)\nA closely-related intra-RNN attention function has been introduced by Cheng et al.

We define ut as a binary value, equal to 1 if the pointer mechanism is used to output yt, and 0 otherwise. In the following equations, all probabilities are conditioned on yt, . . . , yt−1, x, even when not explicitly stated.\nOur token-generation layer generates the fol-\nlowing probability distribution:\np(yt|ut = 0) =\nsoftmax(Wout[h d t ‖c e t‖c d t ] + bout)\n(9)\nOn the other hand, the pointer mechanism uses the temporal attention weights αeti as the probability distribution to copy the input token xi.\np(yt = xi|ut = 1) = α e ti (10)\nWe also compute the probability of using the\ncopy mechanism for the decoding step t:\np(ut = 1) = σ(Wu[h d t ‖c e t‖c d t ] + bu), (11)\nwhere σ is the sigmoid activation function.\nPutting Equations 9 , 10 and 11 together, we obtain our final probability distribution for the output token yt:\np(yt) = p(ut = 1)p(yt|ut = 1)\n+p(ut = 0)p(yt|ut = 0). (12)\nThe ground-truth value for ut and the corresponding i index of the target input token when\nut = 1 are provided at every decoding step during training.

Similar weight-sharing methods have been applied to language modeling (Inan et al., 2016; Press and Wolf, 2016). We believe this method is even more applicable to sequence-to-sequence tasks like summarization where the input and output sequences are tightly related, sharing the same vocabulary and a similar syntax. In practice, we found that a summarization model using such shared weights converges much faster than when using separate Wout and Wemb matrices."

Based on this observation, we force our decoder to never output the same trigram more than once during testing. We do this by setting p(yt) = 0 during beam search, when outputting yt would create a trigram that already exists in the previously decoded sequence of the current beam. Even though this method makes assumptions about the output format and the dataset at hand, we believe that the majority of abstractive summarization tasks would benefit from this hard constraint. We apply this method to all our models in the experiments section."

      "text" : "The most widely used method to train a decoder RNN for sequence generation, called the teacher forcing” algorithm (Williams and Zipser, 1989), minimizes a maximum-likelihood loss at each decoding step. We define y∗ = {y∗1 , y ∗ 2, . . . , y ∗\nn′} as the ground-truth output sequence for a given input sequence x. The maximum-likelihood training objective is the minimization of the following loss:\nLml = −\nn′ ∑\nt=1\nlog p(y∗t |y ∗ 1, . . . , y ∗ t−1, x) (14)\nHowever, minimizing Lml does not always produce the best results on discrete evaluation metrics such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004). This phenomenon has been observed with similar sequence generation tasks like image captioning with CIDEr (Rennie et al., 2016) and machine translation with BLEU (Wu et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2016).\nThere are twomain reasons for this discrepancy. The first one, called exposure bias (Ranzato et al., 2015), comes from the fact that the network is fully supervised at each output token during training, always knowing the ground truth sequence up to the next token to predict, but does not have such supervision when testing, hence accumulating errors as it predicts the sequence. The second reason is more specific to our summarization task: while we only have one ground truth sequence per example during training, a summary can still be considered valid by a human even if it is not equal to the reference summary word for word. The number of potentially valid summaries increases as sequences get longer, since there are more ways to arrange tokens to produce paraphrases or different sentence orders. The ROUGE metrics take some of this flexibility into account, but the maximumlikelihood objective does not."

In our model, we use the self-critical policy gradient training algorithm (Rennie et al., 2016).\nFor this training algorithm, we produce two separate output sequences at each training iteration: ys, which is obtained by sampling from\nthe p(yst |y s 1, . . . , y s t−1, x) probability distribution at each decoding time step, and ŷ, the baseline output, obtained by maximizing the output probability distribution at each time step, essentially performing a greedy search. We define r(y) as the reward function for an output sequence y, comparing it with the ground truth sequence y∗ with the evaluation metric of our choice.\nLrl = (r(ŷ)−r(y s))\nn′ ∑\nt=1\nlog p(yst |y s 1, . . . , y s t−1, x)\n(15)\nWe can see that minimizing Lrl is equivalent to maximizing the conditional likelihood of the sampled sequence ys if it obtains a higher reward than the baseline ŷ, thus increasing the reward expectation of our model."

      "heading" : "3.3 Mixed training objective function",
      "text" : "One potential issue of this reinforcement training objective is that optimizing for a specific discrete metric like ROUGE does not guarantee an increase in quality and readability of the output. It is possible to game such discrete metrics and increase their score without an actual increase in readability or relevance (Liu et al., 2016). While ROUGE measures the n-gram overlap between our generated summary and a reference sequence, humanreadability is better captured by a language model, which is usually measured by perplexity.\nSince our maximum-likelihood training objective (Equation 14) is essentially a conditional language model, calculating the probability of a token yt based on the previously predicted sequence {y1, . . . , yt−1} and the input sequence x, we hypothesize that it can assist our policy learning algorithm to generate more natural summaries. This motivates us to define a mixed learning objective function that combines equations 14 and 15:\nLmixed = γLrl + (1− γ)Lml, (16)\nwhere γ is a scaling factor accounting for the difference in magnitude between Lrl and Lml. A similar mixed-objective learning function has been used by Wu et al. (2016) for machine translation on short sequences, but this is its first use in combination with self-critical policy learning for long summarization to explicitly improve readability in addition to evaluation metrics."

These models use recurrent neural networks (RNN), such as long-short term memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode an input sentence into a fixed vector, and create a new output sequence from that vector using another RNN. To apply this sequence-to-sequence approach to natural language, word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) are used to convert language tokens to vectors that can be used as inputs for these networks. Attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2014) make these models more performant and scalable, allowing them to look back at parts of the encoded input sequence while the output is generated. These models often use a fixed input and output vocabulary, which prevents them from learning representations for new words. One way to fix this is to allow the decoder network to point back to some specific words or subsequences of the input and copy them onto the output sequence (Vinyals et al., 2015; Ling et al., 2016). Gulcehre et al. (2016) and Merity et al. (2016) combine this pointer mechanism with the original word generation layer in the decoder to allow the model to use either method at each decoding step."

RL has been used to solve a wide variety of problems, usually when an agent has to perform discrete actions before obtaining a reward, or when the metric to optimize is not differentiable and traditional supervised learning methods cannot be used. This is applicable to sequence generation tasks, because many of the metrics used to evaluate these tasks (like BLEU, ROUGE or METEOR) are not differentiable.\nIn order to optimize that metric directly, Ranzato et al. (2015) have applied the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) to train various RNN-based models for sequence generation\ntasks, leading to significant improvements compared to previous supervised learning methods. While their method requires an additional neural network, called a critic model, to predict the expected reward and stabilize the objective function gradients, Rennie et al.

These summarization tasks are varied, including short summaries of a single document and long summaries of multiple documents categorized by subject. Most abstractive summarization models have been evaluated on the DUC-2004 dataset, and outperform extractive models on that task (Dorr et al., 2003). However, models trained on the DUC-2004 task can only generate very short summaries up to 75 characters, and are usually used with one or two input sentences. Only Nallapati et al.

Even though this dataset has been used to train extractive summarization systems (Hong and Nenkova, 2014; Li et al., 2016) or closely-related models for predicting the importance of a phrase in an article (Yang and Nenkova, 2014; Nye and Nenkova, 2015; Hong et al., 2015), we are the first group to run an end-to-end abstractive summarization model on the article-abstract pairs of this dataset. While CNN/Daily Mail summaries have a similar wording to their corresponding articles, NYT abstracts are more varied, are shorter and can use a higher level of abstraction and paraphrase. We believe that these two formats are a great complement to each other for abstractive summarization models.\nPreprocessing: We remove all documents that do not have a full article text, abstract or headline. We concatenate the headline, byline and full article text, separated by special tokens, to produce a single input sequence for each example. We tokenize the input and abstract pairs with the Stanford tokenizer (Manning et al., 2014). We convert all tokens to lower-case and replace all numbers with “0”, remove “(s)” and “(m)” marks in the abstracts and all occurrences of the following words, singular or plural, if they are surrounded by semicolons or at the end of the abstract: “photo”, “graph”, “chart”, “map”, “table” and “drawing”. Since the NYT abstracts almost never contain periods, we consider themmulti-sentence summaries if we split sentences based on semicolons. This allows us to make the summary format and evaluation procedure similar to the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. These pre-processing steps give us an average of 549 input tokens and 40 output tokens per example, after limiting the input and output lengths to 800 and 100 tokens.\nPointer supervision: We run each input and abstract sequence through the Stanford named entity recognizer (NER) (Manning et al., 2014). For all named entity tokens in the abstract if the type “PERSON”, “LOCATION”, “ORGANIZATION” or “MISC”, we find their first occurrence in the in-\nput sequence. We use this information to supervise p(ut) (Equation 11) and α e ti (Equation 4) during training. Note that the NER tagger is only used to create the dataset and is no longer needed during testing, thus we’re not adding any dependencies to our model. We also add pointer supervision for out-of-vocabulary output tokens if they are present in the input. Dataset splits: We created our own training,validation, and testing splits for this dataset. Instead of producing random splits, we sorted the documents by their publication date in chronological order and used the first 90% (589,284 examples) for training, the next 5% (32,736) for validation, and the remaining 5% (32,739) for testing. This makes our dataset splits easily reproducible and follows the intuition that if used in a production environment, such a summarization model would be used on recent articles rather than random ones."

Next, we initialize our model with the best ML parameters and we compare reinforcement learning (RL) with our mixed-objective learning (ML+RL), following our objective functions in Equation 15 and 16. For ML training, we use the teacher forcing algorithm with the only difference that at each decoding step, we choose with a 25% probability the previously generated token instead of the ground-truth token as the decoder input token yt−1, which reduces exposure bias (Venkatraman et al., 2015). We use a γ = 0.9984 for the ML+RL loss function. Implementation details: We use two 200- dimensional LSTMs for the bidirectional encoder and one 400-dimensional LSTM for the decoder. We limit the input vocabulary size to 150,000 tokens, and the output vocabulary to 50,000 tokens by selecting the most frequent tokens in the training set. Input word embeddings are 100-dimensional and are initialized with GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014).

This method combines standard supervised word prediction and reinforcement learning (RL). Models trained only with the former often exhibit “exposure bias” – they assume ground truth is provided at each step during training. However, when standard word prediction is combined with the global sequence prediction training of RL the resulting summaries become more readable. We evaluate this model on the CNN/Daily Mail and New York Times datasets. Our model obtains a 41.16 ROUGE-1 score on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, a 5.7 absolute points improvement over previous state-of-the-art models. It also performs well as the first abstractive model on the New York Times corpus. Human evaluation also shows that our model produces higher quality summaries.",
