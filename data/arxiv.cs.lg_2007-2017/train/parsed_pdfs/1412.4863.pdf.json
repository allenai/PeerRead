      "text" : "Index Terms—Feature learning, max-margin, correlation relationship, row sparsity\nI. INTRODUCTION\nData classification plays a key role in many practical applications [1], [2]. However, the real-world data, such as image data, often lie in a high-dimensional space, which has high computational cost and might bring down the prediction accuracy of classification models. To cope with this issue, a popular way is to do dimensionality reduction, which is to project the data into a low-dimensional subspace with the least information loss [3]. Generally speaking, dimensionality reduction can be achieved by either feature selection or feature transformation. Feature selection aims at selecting the most informative feature subset from the original feature set according to a predefined selection criterion. A number of selection criteria have been proposed in the past several years, such as mutual information [4], kernel alignment [5], sparsity regularization based measures [6], [7], and so on. The philosophy behind feature transformation is that a combination of the original features may be more helpful for learning. Hence it aims to map the high-dimensional data into a new meaningful low-dimensional space. Many feature transformation methods have been proposed over the last decades, including manifold learning [8], [9], low-rank representation (LRR) [10], [11], and sparse representation (SR) [12], [13]. According to the characteristics of the mapping, feature transformation techniques can be further grouped into linear [14], [15], [16], [17] and nonlinear ones [18], [8], [9], [19]. In this paper, we focus on the linear feature transformation methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness [20].\nManuscript received May 21, 2015; revised August 04, 2015; accepted January 10, 2016.

(email: qsliu@nuist.edu.cn).\nIn literature, principal component analysis (PCA) [15] and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [21] are two classical linear algorithms, both capturing global Euclidean structure of the data. Since the practical data often lie on or are close to an intrinsically low-dimensional manifold, volumes of approaches focus on how to preserve such structures in recent years. The representative approaches include locality preserving projection (LPP) [14], and neighborhood preserving embedding (NPE) [16], locality sensitive discriminant analysis (LSDA) [22], and stable orthogonal local discriminant embedding (SOLDE) [17]. Meanwhile, some work integrates global and local information during feature transformation, such as LPMIP [23], LapLDA [24]. However, the methods above do not consider how to effectively connect with the classifier in the context of classification. In order to alleviate this limitation, the maximum margin projection (MMP) algorithm [25] takes advantage of a binary support vector machine (SVM) [26] classifier to obtain some hyperplanes that separate data points in different clusters with the maximum margin. The random projection algorithms [27], [28] aim to find some Gaussian random projection matrices to preserve the pairwise distances between data points in the projected subspace, which can be effectively combined with some classifiers, such as SVM. Varshney and Willsky [29] propose a framework to simultaneously learn a linear dimensionality reduction projection matrix and a margin-based classifier defined in the reduced space. The main idea of the maximum margin projection pursuit (MMPP) algorithm is to integrate optimal data embedding and SVM classification in a single framework in both bi-class and multi-class classification [30]. In addition, local discriminant gaussian (LDG) [31] is a feature transformation method which exploits a smooth approximation of the leave-one-out cross validation error of a classifier. However, these methods do not intend to preserve the intrinsic manifold structure of the data and removing noisy features before feature transformation. In addition, there are often correlations among multiple classes in practical scenarios. Previous works do not study how to leverage such correlations with feature transformation. Gu et al. [32] propose a framework for joint subspace learning and feature selection, called FSSL, which can alleviate the effect of the noisy features for feature transformation. However, they do not focus on how to effectively combine the classifier in the scenario of classification.\nIn this paper, we propose a new Max-Margin based feature transformation method to Learn Discriminative Features for classification, called MMLDF. In the learned low-dimensional feature space, our method aims at maximizing the global classification margin; in the meantime, the distances of samples from the same class are minimized. Additionally, in many realworld applications, there are often correlations among multiple classes, and capturing such correlations are helpful for learning\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n48 63\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 A\npr 2\n01 7\n2 discriminative features and designing classifiers [33]. In light of this point, we add a regularization term to capture the correlations among multiple categories for feature learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on eight publicly available datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the state-of-theart methods.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II gives the details of the proposed method. The experimental results are reported and analyzed in Section III. Section IV concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Margin maximization has been demonstrated to be a good principle applied by various learning methods [34], [35]. Among these methods, support vector machine (SVM) is a popular one that maximizes the global margin of data points of different classes, but it only focuses on how to learn a max-margin based classifier. In this paper, we aim at learning a low-dimensional feature space to further improve the performance of max-margin based classification, and we present a unified framework to integrate feature learning and classification together. To do this, we propose the following objective function:\nmin J(P,w, b)= 1\n2 ‖w‖2+C n∑ i=1 l(w, b,P;xi, yi)\n+η n∑ i,j=1 ‖PTxi−PTxj‖2Aij+λ‖P‖2,1 (2)\nwhere C, η and λ are three trade-off parameters, in order to balance the contribution of each term to learn discriminative features. Through these parameters, our model can be flexible to different scenarios. w is the learned weight vector, as in SVM. P is the learned transformation matrix which projects the original data into low-dimensional feature space. PTxi is the new low-dimensional representation of xi. Aij denotes the edge weight of the within-class graph. Here, either Heat kernel or Simple-minded can be used for weighting the edges. For similarity, we choose Simple-minded in our experiment, which is expressed as:\n0\n60\n120\n180\n240\n300 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n(a) Without l2,1 norm constraint\n0\n60\n120\n180\n240\n300 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n(b) With l2,1 norm constraint\nl(•) is a hinge loss function. The standard hinge loss function in SVM is not differentiable everywhere. In order to take advantage of the gradient-based optimization method to solve the proposed objective function, we adopt a similar but differentiable quadratic hinge loss:\nl(w, b,P;xi, yi) = [min(0, yi ·(wT ·(PTxi)+b)−1)]2 (4)\nMinimizing the first two terms of (2) means finding a low-dimensional subspace, in which the margin of different classes can be maximized, and the classification loss can be minimized. Minimizing the third term makes the scatter of the data in the same class as small as possible in the subspace. The last term is a regularization term to make the transformation matrix P sparse in rows, so that the learned subspace is robust to noise, and the model complexity is lowered too.\nWe take the LSVT Voice Rehabilitation dataset [36], a biclass classification dataset, as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the l2,1 norm constraint on P in the objective function (2). Fig. 1 (a) and (b) show the visualizations of P without l2,1 norm and with l2,1 norm in (2), respectively. We can see that many rows in P become sparse by adding the l2,1 norm constraint, which can eliminate noisy features in the process of feature transformation, and can reduce the model complexity. In the later experiment, we will further demonstrate that our method is robust to noise by introducing l2,1 norm."

Similarly, the loss function l is revised as:\nl(wm,wyi , byi , bm,P;xi, yi)\n= [min(0, (wTyiP Txi + byi −wTmPTxi − bm − 2)]2 (6)\nIn real-world applications, one classification task is often correlated with other classification tasks, and mining the correlations among multiple categories can be good for feature learning [33]. Our experiments also demonstrate this point (See the details in III-C). Thus, we add a regularization term into (5) to capture the correlations among multiple categories, and the new objective function becomes:\nmin Jmc(W,b,P,Γ)\n= 1\n2 K∑ m=1 ‖wm‖2+C n∑ i=1 ∑ m 6=yi l(wm,wyi , byi , bm,P;xi, yi)\n+ η n∑ i,j=1 ‖PTxi−PTxj‖2Aij+λ‖P‖2,1+ρ‖WT ‖2Γ (7)\nwhere ρ is a trade-off parameter. ‖WT ‖2Γ = tr(WΓWT ) is the Mahalanobis norm of the matrix WT . Γ plays the role of the inverse covariance matrix that encodes the correlations among the weight vectors wi [37]. The inverse matrix of Γ is constrained to be positive definite and unit trace, in order to obtain a valid solution. The effect of the last term in (7) is to penalize the complexity of W relying on the Mahalanobis norm, as well as to learn the inverse covariance matrix Γ simultaneously.\nWe use the Urban Land Cover dataset [38], a multi-class classification dataset, to visualize the correlation coefficient matrix of the weight vectors, which can be obtained based on the learned Γ. The result is shown in Fig. 2. We can see that there are indeed correlations among the multiple categories (e.g. the second and the third weight vectors)."

      "text" : "We first introduce how to solve the optimization problem in the binary classification case. The objective function (2) is not convex with respect to the variables w, b, and P simultaneously. Therefore it is unrealistic to expect an algorithm to easily find the global minimum of J . Therefore, we adopt an alternating optimization strategy to find the local minimum. Under this scheme, we update P, w, and b in an alternating manner.\nUpdate P, with fixed w and b: When w and b are fixed, (2) becomes a convex problem, so P can be obtained by minimizing the following objective function:\nJ1(P) =C n∑ i=1 [min(0, yi · (wT · (PTxi)+b)−1)]2\n+η n∑ i,j=1 ‖PTxi−PTxj‖2Aij + λ‖P‖2,1\nTaking the derivative of J1 with respect to P, we can obtain:\n∂J1(P)\n∂P =2C ∑ (xi,yi)∈Θ (xix T i Pww T−(yi−b)xiwT )\n+ 2ηXLXTP + 2λDPP (8)\nwhere X = [x1, . . . ,xn].

Θ denotes the set of (xi, yi) satisfying the following condition: yi(wT (PTxi) + b)− 1 ≤ 01.\nSetting the derivative in (8) to zero, these is no closed-from solution of P. Therefore, we adopt a gradient-based method to derive the optimal P. Here we choose the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm for its efficiency [39], [40], which is summarized in Algorithm 1. The core idea in Algorithm 1 is to estimate the inverse Hessian matrix H only using the latest m updates of the position pk and gradient gk to lower memory complexity, where m is usually small.\nAlgorithm 1 L-BFGS Input: Randomly initialize P0 ∈ Rd×r , and reshape P0 into\na vector p0; Randomly initialize a symmetric and positive definite matrix H0; Set the integer m = 25. k ← 0\nOutput: P Repeat\nCompute the gradient Gk = ∂J1(P)∂P |Pk , and reshape Gk into a vector gk.

The procedure of the proposed algorithm can be summarized in Algorithm 2. We randomly initialize the parameters, and adopt the second updating rule in [41] for deriving the local optimal solution. Experimental results verify that MMLDF converges quickly and obtains promising local minimums.\nIn the multi-classification case, we still adopt the alternating optimization strategy to find the local minimum. We take advantage of the L-BFGS to update P and wi. b still has a closed-form solution derived by using the same optimization method with the binary classification case. The rule for updating the variable Γ in (7) is as follows:\nΓ = (WTW)1/2\ntr((WTW)1/2) (11)\nDetails of the proof on (11) can be found in [37]."

However, our approach constructs the graph Laplacian through local learning to capture the intrinsic structure of the data, and incorporates l2,1-norm minimization into our framework to alleviate the effects of noisy features. In addition, our method can mine the correlations among multiple categories, which is beneficial to both feature transformation and classifier training.

Moreover, our method tries to preserve global and local information simultaneously, like LPMIP and LapLDA. In our work, we also try to unify feature transformation and feature selection in a framework, inspired by FSSL. Additionally, LDG and MMPP are two latest feature learning methods.

We can see that MMLDFI outperforms MMPP on the datasets, which shows that the row sparseness constraint on the projection matrix is beneficial to learn discriminative feature representation. On the LSVT Voice Rehabilitation dataset, MMLDF achieves better results than MMLDF-I, which means that within-class scatter minimization is good for classification. This point is also verified on the Urban Land Cover dataset, since MMLDF-II is superior to MMLDF-I. On the multi-class dataset, the result of MMLDF is better than that of MMLDF-II, which illustrates that capturing the correlations among multiple categories is helpful for enhancing the discriminative ability of the learned features.

When C > 10−3, the performance is gradually degraded as C increases. When C is set to 10−3, the performance is the best."

      "heading" : "IV. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "This paper proposed a novel feature transformation method for max-margin based classification. The proposed method aimed to find a low-dimensional feature space to maximize the classification margin of the data and minimize the within class scatter simultaneously. Moreover, we added a regularization term to eliminate noisy or redundant features. Finally, another regularization term was introduced to capture the correlations among multiple categories to help to learn discriminative features. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to several related methods."
