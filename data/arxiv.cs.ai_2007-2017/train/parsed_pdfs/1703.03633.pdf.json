Gradient-based algorithms are by far the most widely used algorithms for training neural networks, such as basic SGD, Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, etc. For a particular neural network, it is unclear a priori which one is the best optimization algorithm, and how to set up the hyperparameters (such as learning rates). It usually takes a lot of time and experienced hands to identify the best optimization algorithm together with best hyperparameters, and possibly some other tricks are necessary to make the network work.\n*Equal contribution †The research is supported in part by the National Basic Research Program of China grants 2015CB358700, 2011CBA00300, 2011CBA00301, and the National NSFC grants 61632016. 1Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

      "text" : "To address the above issue, a promising approach is to use machine learning algorithms to replace the hard-coded optimization algorithms, and hopefully, the learning algorithm is capable of learning a good strategy, from experience, to explore the landscape of the loss function and adaptively choose good descent steps. In a high level, the idea can be categorized under the umbrella of learning-tolearn (or meta-learning), a broad area known to learning community for more than two decades.\nUsing deep learning for training deep neural networks was initiated in a recent paper (Andrychowicz et al., 2016). The authors proposed an optimizer using coordinatewise Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) that takes the gradients of the optimizee as input and outputs the updates for each optimizee parameters. We call this optimizer DMoptimizer throughout this paper, and we use the term optimizee to refer to the loss function of the neural network being optimized. The authors showed that DMoptimizer outperforms traditional optimization algorithms in solving the task on which it is trained, and it also generalizes well to the same type of tasks. In one of their experiments, they trained DMoptimizer to minimize the average loss of a 100-step training process of a 1-hidden-layer Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with sigmoid as the activation function, and the optimizer was shown to have generalization ability to some extent: it also performs well on such MLP with one more hidden layer or double hidden neurons. However, there are still some limitations:\n1. If the activation function of the MLP is changed from sigmoid to ReLU in the test phase, DMoptimizer performs poorly to train such MLP. In other words, their algorithms fail to generalize to different activations.\n2. Even though the authors showed that DMoptimizer performs well to train the optimizee for 200 descent steps, the loss increases dramatically for much longer horizons. In other words, their algorithms fail to handle a relatively large number of descent steps."

The other trick is to combine the loss function of the optimizee with other simple convex functions, which helps to accelerate the training process. With the help of our new training tricks, our new model, called RNNprop, achieves notable improvements upon previous work after being trained on a simple 1-hidden-layer MLP:\n1. It can train optimizees for longer horizons. In particular, when RNNprop is only trained to minimize the final loss of a 100-step training process, in testing phase it can successfully train optimizees for several thousand steps.\n2.

      "text" : "The notion of learning to learn or meta-learning has been used to address the concept of learning meta-knowledge about the learning process for years. However, there is no agreement on the exact definition of meta-learning, and various concepts have been developed by different authors (Thrun & Pratt, 1998; Vilalta & Drissi, 2002; Brazdil et al., 2008).\nIn this paper, we view the training process of a neural network as an optimization problem, and we use an RNN as an optimizer to train other neural networks. The usage of another neural network to direct the training of neural networks has been put forward by Naik and Mammone (1992). In their early work, Cotter and Younger (1990; 1999) argued that RNNs can be used to model adaptive optimization algorithms (Prokhorov et al., 2002). This idea was further developed in (Younger et al., 2001; Hochreiter et al., 2001) and gradient descent is used to train an RNN optimizer on convex problems. Recently, as shown in Section 1.1, Andrychowicz et al. (2016) proposed a more general optimizer model using LSTM to learn gradient descent, and our work directly follows their work. In another recent paper (Chen et al., 2016), an RNN is used to take current position and value as input and outputs the next position, and it works well for black-box optimization and simple RL tasks.\nFrom a reinforcement learning perspective, the optimizer can be viewed as a policy which takes the current state as input and output the next action (Schmidhuber et al., 1999). Two recent papers (Daniel et al., 2016; Hansen, 2016) trained adaptive controllers to adjust the hyperparameters (learning rate) of traditional optimization algorithms from this perspective. Their method can be regarded as hyperparameter optimization. More general methods have been introduced in (Li & Malik, 2017; Wang et al., 2016) which also take the RL perspective and train a neural network to model a policy."

In the case when the optimizee is stochastic, that is, the value of f(θ) de-\npends on the sample d selected from a dataset D, the goal of an optimizer is to minimize\n1 |D| ∑ d∈D fd(θ) (1)\nover the variables θ.\nWhen optimizing an optimizee on a datasetD, the behavior of an optimizer can be summarized by the following loop. For each step:\n1. Given the current parameters θt and a sample dt ∈ D, perform forward and backward propagation to compute the function value yt = fdt(θt) and the gradient gt = ∇fdt(θt);\n2. Based on the current state ht (of the optimizer) and the gradient gt, the optimizer produces the new state ht+1 and proposes an increment ∆θt;\n3. Update the parameters by setting θt+1 = θt + ∆θt.\nIn the initialization phase, h0 is produced by the optimizer, and θ0 is generated according to the initialization rule of the given optimizee.

      "heading" : "3.2. Some Insight into Adaptivity",
      "text" : "Table 1 summaries optimization algorithms that are most commonly used when training neural networks. All of these optimization algorithms have some degree of adaptivity, that is, they are able to adjust the effective step size |∆θt| when training.\nWe can divide these algorithms into two classes. The first class includes SGD and Momentum, as they determine the effective step size by the absolute size of gradients. The second class includes Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. These algorithms maintain the sum or the moving average of past gradients g2t , which can be seen as, with a little abuse of terminology, the second raw moment (or uncentered variance). Then, these algorithms produce the effective step size only by the relative size of the gradient, namely, the gradient divided by the square root of the second moment coordinatewise.\nIn a training process, as the parameters gradually approach to a local minimum, a smaller effective step size is required for a more careful local optimization. To obtain such smaller effective step size, these two classes of algorithms have two different mechanisms. For the first class, if we take the full gradient, the effective step size automatically gets smaller when approaching to a local minimum. However, since we use stochastic gradient descent, the effective step size may not be small enough, even if θ is not\nfar from a local minimum. For the second class, a smaller effective step size |∆θt,i| of each coordinate i is mainly induced by a relatively smaller partial derivative comparing with past partial derivatives. When approaching to a local minimum, the gradient may fluctuate due to stochastic nature. Algorithms of the second class can decrease the effective step size of each coordinate in accordance with the fluctuation amplitude of that coordinate, i.e., a coordinate with larger uncentered variance yields smaller effective step size. Thus, the algorithms of the second class are able to further decrease effective step size for the coordinates with more uncertainty, and they are more robust than those of the first class.\nTo get more insight into the difference between these two classes of algorithms, we consider what happens if we scale the optimizee by a factor c, i.e., let f̃(θ) = cf(θ). Ideally, the scaling should not affect the behaviors of the algorithms. However, for the algorithms of the first class, since ∇f̃(θ) = c∇f(θ), the effective step size is also scaled by c. Hence, the behaviors of the algorithms change completely. But for the algorithms of the second class, they behave the same on f̃(θ) and f(θ) since the scale factor c is canceled out. Thus the algorithms of the second class are more robust with respect to scaling.\nThe above observation, albeit very simple, is a key inspiration for our new model. On the one hand, we use some training tricks so that our model can be exposed to functions with different scales at the training stage. On the other hand, we take relative gradients as input so that our optimizer belongs to the second class. In the following section, we introduce our training tricks and new model in details."

The RNN optimizer handles the gradients coordinatewise and maintains hidden states for every coordinate respectively. The parameters of the RNN itself are shared between different coordinates. In this way, the RNN optimizer can train optimizees with any number of parameters."

      "heading" : "4.1. Random Scaling",
      "text" : "We propose a training trick, called Random Scaling, to prevent overfitting when training our model. Before introducing our ideas, consider what happens if we train an RNN optimizer to minimize f(θ) = λ‖θ‖22 with initial parameter θ0. Clearly, θt+1 = θt − 12λ∇f(θt) is the optimal policy since the lowest point can be reached in just one step. However, if the RNN optimizer learns to follow this rule exactly, testing this RNN optimizer on the same function with different λmight produce a modest or even bad result.\nThe method to solve this issue is rather simple: We randomly pick a λ for every iteration when training our RNN optimizer. Notice that we can also pick a random number to scale all the parameters to achieve the same goal. To further generalize this idea, we design our training trick, Random Scaling, which coordinatewise randomly scales the parameters of the objective function in the training stage.\nIn more details, for each iteration of training the optimizer on a loss function f(θ) with initial parameter θ0, we first randomly pick a vector c of the same dimension as θ, where each coordinate of c is sampled independently from a distribution D0. Then, we train our model on a new optimizee\nfc(θ) = f(cθ) (2)\nwith initial parameter c−1θ0, where all the multiplication and inversion operations are performed coordinatewise. In this way, the RNN optimizer is forced to learn an adaptive policy to determine the best effective step size, rather than to learn the best effective step size itself of a particular task."

      "heading" : "4.2. Combination with Convex Functions",
      "text" : "Now we introduce another training trick. It is clear that we should train our RNN optimizer on optimizees implemented with neural networks. However, due to non-convex and stochastic nature of neural networks, it may be hard for an RNN to learn the basic idea of gradient descent.\nOur idea is loosely inspired by the proximal algorithms (see e.g., (Parikh & Boyd, 2014)). To make training easier, we combine the original optimizee function f with an n-dim convex function g to get a new optimizee function F\nF (θ,x) = f(θ) + g(x). (3)\nFor every iteration of training RNN optimizer, we generate a random vector v in n-dim vector space, and the function g is defined as\ng(x) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 (xi − vi)2, (4)\nwhere the initial value of x is also generated randomly.\nWithout this trick, the RNN optimizer wanders around aimlessly on the non-convex loss surface of function f in the beginning stage of training. After we combine the optimizee with function g, since g has the good property of convexity, our RNN optimizer soon learns some basic knowledge of gradient descent from these additional optimizee coordinates. This knowledge is shared with other coordinates because the RNN optimizer processes its input coordinatewise. In this way, we can accelerate the training process of the RNN optimizer. As the training continues, the RNN optimizer further learns a better method with gradient decent as a baseline.\nWe can apply Random Scaling on the function g as well to make the behavior of the RNN optimizer more robust."

      "heading" : "4.3. RNNprop Model",
      "text" : "Aside from the above two tricks, we also design a new model RNNprop as shown in Figure 1. All the operations in our model are coordinatewise, following the idea of DMoptimizer idea in (Andrychowicz et al., 2016).\nThe main difference between RNNprop and DMoptimizer is the input. The input m̃t and g̃t are defined as follows:\nm̃t = m̂tv̂ −1/2 t , (5)\ng̃t = gtv̂ −1/2 t , (6)\nwhere m̂t, v̂t are defined the same way as Adam in Table 1. This change of the input has three advantages. First, this input contains no information about the absolute size of gradients, so our algorithm belongs to the second class automatically and hence is more robust. Second, this manipulation of gradients can be seen as a kind of normalization so that the input values are bounded by a constant, which is somewhat easier for a neural network to learn. Lastly, if our model outputs a constant times m̃t, it reduces to Adam. Similarly, if our model outputs a constant times g̃t, then it reduces to RMSprop. Hence, the hope is that by further optimizing the parameters of RNNprop, it is capable of achieving better performance than Adam and RMSprop with fixed learning rate.\nThe input is preprocessed by a fully-connected layer with ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) as the activation function (Clevert et al., 2015) before being handled by the RNN. The central part of our model is the RNN, which is a twolayer coordinatewise LSTM that is same as DMoptimizer. The RNN outputs a single vector xout, and the increment is taken as\n∆θt = α tanh(xout). (7)\nThis formula can be viewed as a variation of gradient clipping so that all effective step sizes are bounded by the preset parameter α. In all our experiments, we just set a large enough value α = 0.1."

      "heading" : "5. Experiments",
      "text" : "We trained two RNN optimizers, one to reproduce DMoptimizer in (Andrychowicz et al., 2016), the other to implement RNNprop with our new training tricks. Their performances were compared in a number of experiments. 1\nWe use the same optimizee as in (Andrychowicz et al., 2016) to train these two optimizers, which is the crossentropy loss of a simple MLP on the MNIST dataset. For convenience, we address this MLP as the base MLP. It has one hidden layer of 20 hidden units and uses sigmoid as activation function. The value of f(θ) is computed using a minibatch of 128 random pictures. For each iteration during training, the optimizers are allowed to run for 100 steps. Optimizers are trained using truncated Backpropagation Trough Time (BPTT). We split the 100 steps into 5 periods of 20 steps. In each period, we initialize the initial parameter θ0 and initial hidden state h0 from the last period or generate them if it is the first period. Adam is used to minimize the loss L(φ) = 1T ∑T t=1 wtf(θt). We trained DMoptimizer using the loss with wt = 1 for all t as in (Andrychowicz et al., 2016). For RNNprop we set wT = 1 and wt = 0 for other t. In this way, the optimizer is not strictly required to produce a low loss at each step, so it can be more flexible. We also notice that this loss results in slightly better performance.\nThe structure of our model RNNprop is shown in Section 4.3. The RNN is a two-layer LSTM whose hidden state size is 20. To avoid division by zero, in actual experiments we add another term = 10−8, and the input is changed to\nm̃t = m̂t(v̂ 1/2 t + ) −1, (8)\ng̃t = gt(v̂ 1/2 t + ) −1. (9)\nThe parameters β1 and β2 for computing mt and gt are\n1Our code can be found at https://github.com/ vfleaking/rnnprop.\nsimply set to 0.95. In preprocessing, the input is mapped to a 20-dim vector for each coordinate.\nWhen training RNNprop, we first apply Random Scaling to the optimizee function f and the convex function g respectively, where g is defined as Equation (4), and then we combine them together as introduced in Section 4.2. We set the dimension of the convex function g to be n = 20 and generate the vectors v and x from [−1, 1]n uniformly randomly. To generate each coordinate of the vector c in Random Scaling, we first generate a number p from [−L,L] uniformly randomly, and then take exp(p) as the value of that coordinate, where exp is the natural exponential function. This implementation is aimed to produce c of different order of magnitude, e.g., Pr[ 110 ≤ ci ≤ 1 9 ] = Pr[9 ≤ ci ≤ 10]. We also tried other transformations including using uniform distribution, scaling the entire function directly, randomly dropping some coordinates, etc. This version of Random Scaling is selected after comprehensive comparison. In the experiments we set L = 3 for the function f and L = 1 for the function g.\nWe save all the parameters of the RNN optimizers every 1000 iterations when training. For DMoptimizer, we select the saved optimizer with the best performance on the validation task, same as in (Andrychowicz et al., 2016). Since RNNprop tends not to overfit to the training task because of the Random Scaling method, we simply select the saved optimizer with lowest average train loss, which is the moving average of the losses of the past 1000 iterations with decay factor 0.9. The selected optimizers are then tested on other different tasks. Their performances are compared with the best traditional optimization algorithms whose learning rates are carefully chosen and other hyperparameters are set to the default values in Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016). All the initial optimizee parameters used in the experiments are generated independently from the Gaussian distribution N(0, 0.1).\nAll figures shown in this section were plotted after running the optimization process multiple times with random initial values and data. We removed the outliers with exceedingly large loss value when plotting the loss curves. No loss value of RNNprop was removed when plotting the figures."

Both DMoptimizer and RNNprop outperform all traditional optimization algorithms. DMoptimizer has better performance possibly because of overfitting. We then test optimizers to run for more steps on the base MLP. The left plot of Figure 2 indicates that RNNprop can achieve comparable performance with traditional algorithms for 2000 steps while DMoptimizer fails.\nWe also test the optimizers for much more steps: 10000 steps, as shown in the right plot of Figure 2. It is clear that DMoptimizer loses the ability to decrease the loss after about 400 steps and its loss begins to increase dramatically. RNNprop, on the other hand, is able to decrease the loss continuously, though it slows down gradually and traditional algorithms overtake it. The main reason is that RNNprop is trained to run for only 100 steps, and 10000- step training process may be significantly different from 100-step training process. Additionally, traditional optimization algorithms are able to achieve good performance on both tasks because we explicitly adjusted their learning rates to adapt to these tasks.\nFigure 3 shows how the final loss after 10000 steps changes when using different learning rates. For example, Adam can outperform RNNprop only if its learning rate lies in the narrow interval from 0.004 to 0.01.\nFor other optimizees, RNNprop shows similar ability to train for longer horizons.

Recently, researchers have tried to use deep learning algorithms to exploit the landscape of the loss function of the training problem of interest, and learn how to optimize over it in an automatic way. In this paper, we propose a new learning-to-learn model and some useful and practical tricks. Our optimizer outperforms generic, hand-crafted optimization algorithms and state-of-the-art learning-to-learn optimizers by DeepMind in many tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on a number of tasks, including deep MLPs, CNNs, and simple LSTMs.",
