      "text" : "This paper introduces the visually informed embedding of word (VIEW), a continuous vector representation for a word extracted from a deep neural model trained using the Microsoft COCO data set to forecast the spatial arrangements between visual objects, given a textual description. The model is composed of a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP) stacked on the top of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, the latter being preceded by an embedding layer. The VIEW is applied to transferring multimodal background knowledge to Spatial Role Labeling (SpRL) algorithms, which recognize spatial relations between objects mentioned in the text. This work also contributes with a new method to select complementary features and a fine-tuning method for MLP that improves the F1 measure in classifying the words into spatial roles. The VIEW is evaluated with the Task 3 of SemEval-2013 benchmark data set, SpaceEval."

      "text" : "One of the essential functions of natural language is to describe location and translocation of objects in space. Spatial language can convey complex spatial relations along with polysemy and ambiguity inherited in natural language. Therefore, a formal spatial model is required, to focus on some particular spatial aspects. This paper address a layer of linguistic conceptual representation, called spatial role labeling (SpRL), which predicts the existence of spatial information at the sentence level by identifying the words that play a particular spatial role as well as their spatial relationship Kordjamshidi & Moens (2015).\nAn issue in extracting spatial semantics from natural language is the lack of annotated data on which machine learning can be employed to learn and extract the spatial relations. Current SpRL algorithms rely strongly on feature engineering, which has the advantage of encoding human knowledge, thus compensating for the lack of annotated training data. This work preserves the previous contributions on feature engineering of Kordjamshidi & Moens (2015) while adding a new set of features learned from multimodal data, i.e. the visually informed embedding of word (VIEW).\nMultimodal data is usually associated with multimodal representation learning, which has been studied by various authors, such as Srivastava & Salakhut-\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n08 47\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n8 M\nar 2\ndinov (2012), which uses deep Boltzmann machines for representing joint multimodal probability distributions over images and sentences, Karpathy et al. (2014), which then embed fragments of images (objects) and fragments of sentences (dependency tree relations) into a common space for bidirectional retrieval of images and sentences, and Kiros et al. (2014), which unify joint imagetext embedding models with multimodal neural language models to rank images and sentences (as well as to generate descriptions for images) using a long short term memory (LSTM) network to process text and deep convolutional network (CNN) to process images.\nSimilar to the work Kiros et al. (2014) our model learns embedding from multimodal data and applies LSTM to process textual information. However, unlike most of the works on multimodal representation learning, which jointly map visual and textual information into a common embedding space, our work aims at providing embeddings only for words, but encoding spatial information extracted from the image annotations. The idea is to learn VIEW by pipelining an embedding layer into a deep architecture trained by back propagation to predict the spatial arrangement between the visual objects annotated in the pictures, given the respective textual descriptions. In this sense, unlike Karpathy et al. (2014) and Kiros et al. (2014), we don’t need a CNN, because the spatial information which is relevant for our purpose is provided directly by the position of the bounding boxes containing the visual objects annotated in the images, as detailed in Section 3. Our VIEW is used as a vehicle to transfer spatial information from multimodal data to SpRL algorithms.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 3, we describe the model setting, from the annotation style through the modeling of the deep neural network, whose training algorithm is described in Section 4. Section 5 describes how the spatial embedding is applied in SpRL, as well as the algorithm developed to select the best complementary embedding features and the fine-tuning method able to deal with the tradeoff of precision and recall, aiming at the largest F1. Section 6 reports and discusses the experiments, while Section 7 summarizes the major findings."

      "text" : "The SpRL algorithm recognizes spatial objects in language (i.e. trajector and landmark) and their spatial relation signaled by the spatial indicator. The trajector is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that denotes an object of a spatial scene, more specifically, an object that moves. A landmark is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that denotes the location of this trajector object in the spatial scene. The spatial indicator is a spatial role label assigned to a word or a phrase that signals the spatial relation trajector and landmark.\nIn this work we apply the SpRL algorithm developed for the work Kordjamshidi & Moens (2015), which models this problem as a structured prediction task Taskar et al. (2005), that is, it jointly recognizes the spatial relation and its\ncomposing role elements in text. The SpRL algorithm receives as input a natural language sentence, such as “There is a white large statue with spread arms on a hill”, having a number of words, in this case identified as w = {w1, . . . ,w12}, where wi is the i\nth word in the sentence. Each word in the sentence that can be part of a spatial relation (e.g., nouns, prepositions) is described by a vector of the local features denoted by φword(wi), including linguistically motivated lexical, syntactical and semantical features of words, such as the lexical surface form, its semantic role, its part-of-speech and the lexical surface form of words in the neighborhood. This feature vector is used to relate a word with its spatial role, i.e. spatial indicator, trajector or landmark, hence further represented by sp, tr and lm, respectively.\nThere are also descriptive vectors of pairs of words, referred to as φpair(wi,wj), encoding the linguistically motivated features of pairs of words and their relational features, such as their relative position in the sentence, their distance in terms of number of words and the path between them obtained with a syntactic parser. The SpRL model is trained on a training set of sentences annotated with the above output labels. Following training, the system outputs all spatial relations found in a sentence of a test set composed of the sentences and their corresponding spatial roles.\nThe main research question approached in this paper regards the possibility of improving the quality of φword(wi) by concatenating the VIEW in this feature vector. It derives a secondary research question on the possibility of encoding visual information from COCO images into the word embeddings by learning a model able to map from the captions to a simplified representation of the visual objects annotated in the corresponding image and their relative position. We assume that the necessary condition to correctly forecast the visual output, given the textual description, is that the embedding layer (which is in the model pipeline) is successfully encoding the spatial information of the textual description, assuring a suitable word embedding for this specific task related with SpRL.\nAnother research question regards the importance of feature selection in order to discard embedding features that are not directly related to the SpRL task, since our data set derived from COCO is not created for SpRL; therefore, some features can act as noise for SpRL."

      "heading" : "3 The model setting",
      "text" : "The Microsoft COCO data set Lin et al. (2014) is a collection of images featuring complex everyday scenes which contain common visual objects in their natural context. COCO contains photos of 91 object types with a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images. Each image has five written caption descriptions. The visual objects within the image are tight-fitted by bounding boxes from annotated segmentation masks, as can be seen in Fig.1.\nOur annotation system automatically derives a less specific spatial annotation about the relative position between the center points of the bounding\nboxes containing visual objects, given COCO’s annotation of the coordinates of the bounding boxes. Our annotation style is ruled by the predicates alone(v1), below(v1, v2) and beside(v1, v2), where v1 and v2 are visual objects, see Fig.2. This information is encoded in a sparse target vector, Y , where the first three positions encode the predicate in one-hot vector style, and the ensuing positions encode the index of the visual objects, also in one-hot vector style, i.e. 3 positions to encode the predicates plus 91 positions to encode the index of the first argument (visual object) plus other 91 positions for the second argument, totalizing 185 positions in the target vector. If the predicate is alone(v1), i.e. when a single visual object is annotated in the image, the last 91 positions are all zeros.\nDespite having a large number of annotated objects per image, MS-COCO has several objects belonging to the same category per image, and so, a small number of categories per image. On average MS-COCO data set contains 3.5 categories per image, yielding 7.7 instances per image (see Section 5 of Lin et al. (2014)). Our annotation system is based on two assumptions: 1) learning the spatial arrangement between visual objects belonging to the same category is not useful: 2) objects placed at the center of the image are more salient, and\nso, they are likely to be present in the captions. Therefore, our system ranks the bounding boxes from the most centered box to the least centered box and starts by selecting the most centered bounding box as the first visual object. Then, it searches from the second higher ranked bounding box to those with a lower rank, until it reaches a visual object belonging to a different category or the end of the list of instances, i.e. our system selects only a pair of visual objects belonging to different categories.\nIn summary, the system learns how to map the captions to the spatial relation between the most salient pair of objects belonging to different categories. For instance, in Fig.1 the system selects the man and the most centered sheep (not the dog in the corner of the image) to generate the target output for all the five captions, yielding five training examples. Notice that the dog is only cited in one of the five captions."

Since COCO’s captions are shorter than 30 words, our system cuts texts after the limit of 30 words; therefore, the data pair for the ith caption is composed by a sparse matrix Xi of dimension 8000×30 per target vector, yi, of 185 dimensions, as explained in the previous paragraph. Captions with less than 30 words are\n1The words, encoded in one-hot vectors, are provided sequentially to the model.\nencoded into a matrix Xi whose the first columns are filled with all-zeros. Each figure has five associated captions, which yields five training examples with the same target vector, but different input vectors.\nOur deep model is trained to forecast the visual objects and their spatial relation (i.e. alone(v1), below(v1, v2) and beside(v1, v2)), given the textual description in the caption.\nThe model was implemented in Keras2 and it is pipeline composed of a linear embedding layer, an original version of LSTM network, as proposed in Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and a deep multilayer perceptron (MLP), see Fig.3. The embedding layer receives the sparse input Xi, representing a sentence, and encodes the one-hot vector representation of the words (i.e. the columns of Xi) into a set of 30 dense vectors of Nw dimensions that are provided sequentially to the LSTM, which extracts a Ns-dimensional vector from the sentence (after 30 iterations). This vector representation of the sentence (i.e. a sentence-level embedding) is mapped to the sparse spatial representation yi by the MLP.\nWe also evaluated an architecture where the LSTM directly predicts the sparse output vector (without MLP), but the result was better using the MLP. The latent representation of sentences, i.e. the sentence-level embedding, makes possible the choice of a suitable dimension for the LSTM output, rather than forcing the LSTM output to be the sparse 185-dimensional target vector.\nThe ith caption yields a matrix Xi from which a set of 30 input vectors, here represented by xt (t = 1, . . . , 30), are sequentially given to the model.\n2http://keras.io/\nOur model starts by computing the word embedding:\net = Wext (1)\nwhere the adjustable embedding matrix, We, has the dimension of 8000×Nw, i.e. it maps from the 8000-dimensional one-hot vector representation of words to a Nw-dimensional continuous vector representation et. Then the system calculates the state variables of the LSTM, starting by the input gate it and the candidate value for the states of the memory cells C̃t at iteration t, as follows:\nit = σ(Wiet + Uiht−1 + bi) (2)\nC̃t = tanh(Wcet + Ucht−1 + bc) (3)\nwhere σ(·) represents the sigmoid function, Wi, Ui, Wc, Uc, bi and bc are adjustable parameters and ht−1 is the LSTM output at the previous iteration. Having it and C̃t the system can compute the activation of the memory forget gates, ft, at iteration t:\nft = σ(Wfet + Ufht−1 + bf ) (4)\nwhere Wf , Uf and bf are adjustable parameters. Having it, ft and the candidate state value C̃t, the system can compute the new state of the memory cells, Ct, at iteration t: Ct = it ∗ C̃t + ft ∗ Ct−1 (5) where ∗ represents the point-wise multiplication operation. With the new state of the memory cells, Ct, the system can compute the value of their output gates, ot:\not = σ(Woet + Uoht−1 + bo) (6)\nwere Wo, Uo and bo are adjustable parameters. Having ot, the system can finally calculate the output of the LSTM, ht:\nht = ot ∗ tanh(Ct) (7)\nAt this point we have both word-level and sentence-level embeddings, given by (1) and (7), respectively. Each Ns-dimensional sentence embedding is produced after 30 iteration of LSTM (the adopted sentence length), when it is ready to be processed by the MLP. Therefore, the LSTM output is sub-sampled in the rate of 1/30, yielding hi, i.e. the input for the MLP (note the changing of the index variable in relation to (7)).\nThe adopted MLP has two sigmoidal hidden layers and a sigmoidal output layer. The optimal number of hidden layers was empirically determined based on the performance on MS-COCO. The MLP model is given by:\nyh(1,i) = σ (W1hi + b1) yh(2,i) = σ ( W2yh(1,i) + b2 ) ŷi = σ ( W3yh(2,i) + b3\n) (8) where Wj and bj are the weight matrix and bias vector of layer j, respectively, and yh(j,i) is the output vector of the hidden layer j."

      "heading" : "5.1 Selecting complementary Features",
      "text" : "Our aim is to select complementary features from the VIEW so as to maximize the mutual information between the target output, here represented by\nthe scalar random variable r, and the selected features, represented by the random variables x1 ∈ X1, . . . , xn ∈ Xn, while minimizing the mutual information between the selected features and the original SpRL features, φword(·).\nThe method introduced in this section requires a scalar random variable, r, as target output. However, the target output of SemEval is a 3-dimensional one-hot vector indicating the spatial roles, i.e. sp, tr and lm. Therefore, we convert this binary number with 3 binary digits into a decimal number, i.e. a scalar.\nThe mutual information is given by:\nI(x1, . . . , xn; r) = H(x1, . . . , xn) +H(r)−H(x1, . . . , xn, r)\n(11)\nwhere n is the arbitrary number of selected features and H(.) represents the entropy of a set of random variables, given by:\nH(x1, . . . , xn) = − ∫ X1 . . . ∫ Xn p(x1, . . . , xn) log p(x1, . . . , xn)dx1 . . . dxn\n(12)\nEven assuming a discrete approximation for the joint density, p(x1, . . . , xn), e.g. normalized histograms, the calculation of (12) for several random variables is computationally unfeasible. Therefore, we adopt an indirect approach by applying the principle of Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy Peng et al. (2005). According to this principle it is possible to maximize (12) by jointly solving the following two problems:\nmax i1,...,in φ(i1, . . . , in) (13)\nwhere in is the index of the n th selected feature, φ(i1, . . . , in) = V (i1, . . . , in)− D(i1, . . . , in),\nV (i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn n∑ k=1 I(xik ; r), (14)\nD(i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn2 n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 I(xij ;xik) (15)\nThe idea is to find the set of indexes, i1, . . . , in, that simultaneously maximize the relevance (14) and minimize the redundancy (15). Notice that this procedure requires the calculation of a matrix S ∈ Rn×n whose the elements are the mutual information values I(xij ;xik). However, this is a naive approach, since this method doesn’t take into account the redundancy between the embedding features and the original 8099 SpRL features of φword(·). The computational cost increases significantly by considering the whole problem. Let xSpRLk be the kth original feature from φword(·), then the complete problem can be modeled as:\nmax i1,...,in φ(i1, . . . , in) (16)\nV (i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn+m ( n∑ k=1 I(xik ; r)+\nm∑ j=1 I(xSpRLij ; r)\n , (17)\nD(i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn2 + nm+m2  n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 I(xij ;xik)+\nn∑ l=1 m∑ z=1 I(xil ;x SpRL iz ) + m∑ w=1 m∑ q=1 I(xSpRLiw ;x SpRL iq )\n) (18)\nwhere m is the number of original features from φword(·). Fortunately, the terms ∑m j=1 I(x SpRL ij ; y) and ∑m w=1 ∑m q=1 I(x SpRL iw\n;xSpRLiq ) are constant in relation to the manipulated indexes, i.e. the mutual information between the original SpRL features and the output, as well as the mutual information between pairs of SpRL features, don’t matter for this optimization problem, alleviating the computational cost. Therefore, (16)-(18) can be simplified as follows:\nmax i1,...,in φ(i1, . . . , in) (19)\nV (i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn n∑ k=1 I(xik ; r), (20)\nD(i1, . . . , in) = 1\nn2 + nm  n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 I(xij ;xik)+\nn∑ l=1 m∑ z=1 I(xil ;x SpRL iz )\n) (21)\nThe optimization problem (19)-(21) requires the calculation of a matrix with the pairwise mutual information values of dimension n×m, in the place of the m × m matrix required by (18). In our case it means a computational effort around 100 times smaller.\nWe solved (19)-(21) by slightly adapting the Feature Selector based on Genetic Algorithm and Information Theory3 Ludwig & Nunes (2010)."

The adopted MLP has a single sigmoid hidden layer and a linear output layer.\nOne of the issues that we observe in applying MLP trained with MSE on SpRL data is the unbalanced relation between precision and recall that worsens with the use of the embedding, resulting in damage on the F1. This issue is usually solved by manipulating the threshold; however, a larger gain on F1 can be obtained by manipulating all the parameters of the output layer. Therefore, we propose a fine-tuning of the output layer, by maximizing an approximation of F1 squared. We start by analyzing the simplest approach:\nmax w,b\nF12 (22)\nwhere w and b are the adjustable parameters of the linear output layer of the MLP. F1 is function of the true positive (TP ) and true negative examples (TN), as follows:\nF1 = 2TP\nN + TP − TN (23)\nTP = 1\n2 Np∑ i=1 (1 + ϕ(wxpi + b)) (24)\nTN = 1\n2 Nn∑ j=1 ( 1− ϕ(wxnj + b) ) (25)\nwhere ϕ(·) = sign(·) returns 1 or −1 according to the sign of the argument, N is the number of examples, Np and Nn are the number of positive and negative examples, respectively, and xpi and x n j are the outputs of the hidden layer of the MLP (i.e. the inputs of the output layer) for the ith positive example and the jth negative example, respectively.\nUnfortunately, the sign function is not suitable for gradient based optimization methods; therefore, we approximate this function by hyperbolic tangent, yielding the approximate ˜TP , ˜TN and F̃1, whose relation is given by:\nF̃1 = 2 ˜TP\nN + ˜TP − ˜TN (26)\nTo derive a lower bound on F1 as a function of F̃1, ˜TP and ˜TN , let us analyze the bounds on the difference (sign(·)− tanh(·)) by one-sided limit:\nlim v→0−\n(sign(v)− tanh(v)) = −1 (27)\nlim v→0+\n(sign(v)− tanh(v)) = 1 (28)\nFrom (27), (28) and (24) we can derive bounds on TP as a function of its approximation ˜TP :\n˜TP − Np 2 < TP < ˜TP + Np 2\n(29)\nNotice that we can relax these bounds by substituting Np by the largest value between Np and Nn, henceforward called Nl, i.e.:\n˜TP − Nl 2 < TP < ˜TP + Nl 2\n(30)\nSimilar bounds can be derived for TN :\n˜TN − Nl 2 < TN < ˜TN + Nl 2\n(31)\nBy substituting the lower bounds of (30) and (31) into (23) and using (26) we can derive a lower bound on F1:\nF1 > (1− Nl 2 ˜TP )F̃1 (32)\nFrom (32) we conclude that it is desirable to have (1− Nl 2T̃P ) > 0, since this is a necessary condition (but not sufficient) to have the lower bound of F1 increasing together with F̃1. Therefore, we propose the constrained optimization problem:\nmax w,b,ζ\nF̃1 2 + Cζ\ns.t. ˜TP > Nl 2 + ζ\n(33)\nwhere ζ is a slack variable.

The VIEW is concatenated only to φword(·), having a secondary role in this set of experiments.\nThe VIEW yields performance gains in classifying words into the roles sp and lm, as can be seen in Tables 7 and 8, which summarize the performance indexes using only the original features from φword(·) and φpair(·, ·) and using φword(·) concatenated with the VIEW. Table 9 shows the performance of the\nusual Word2Vec embedding Mikolov et al. (2013) concatenated to the original SpRL features, using the SpRL algorithm with the same setup assumed for the experiments with VIEW."

      "text" : "This paper introduces a new approach in transferring spatial knowledge from multimodal data through the VIEW. The experiments provide evidence for the effectiveness of our method in transferring information useful in improving the performance of SpRL algorithms, specially in classifying words into spatial roles.\nThe experiments also provide evidence for the effectiveness of the algorithms for complementary feature selection and F1 maximization, introduced in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, in improving the gains obtained by using the VIEW.\nAs for future work we aim at developing a method for F1 optimization in the structured prediction setting by extending the work Joachims (2005) for the structured classification setting.\nWe believe that the results reported in this paper may improve with the increasing amount of annotated data. Notice that despite having a large cardinality, the COCO data set has a small variety of visual objects in its gold standard, i.e. it has only 91 object categories (including the super-categories)."

The VIEW is applied to transferring multimodal background knowledge to Spatial Role Labeling (SpRL) algorithms, which recognize spatial relations between objects mentioned in the text.
