      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "It is common to see fully connected network has been widely applied in deep learning [1][2]. And the matrix multiplication operation plays an important role of a key mathematic tool in solving deep learning computations. The general form of matrix multiplication for two matrices A and B, which are both row-major matrices, can be represented as follows:\nC = A× B (1)\nwhere A ∈ Rm×k, B ∈ Rk×n and C ∈ Rm×n. Assume that the element in row i and column j of a matrix M is Mij , we have:\nCij = k∑\nk=1\nAik × Bkj (2)\nThere is another form of matrix multiplication, which is A times the transpose of B, i.e.,\nC = A× BT (3)\nwhere BT is the transpose of B, BTji = Bij and B ∈ Rn×k.\nFrom Equation 2, we can find that the complexity of matrix multiplication is O(m×k×n), which is a very timeconsuming computation on a serial algorithm. To do the computation of Equation 3, there are two general methods. The first one is that not to change the positions of elements of B, when it needs to access the column elements, it changes to access the corresponding row elements instead. The second is to transpose B to BT , and then do the matrixmatrix multiplication. In this paper, we focus on accelerating Equation 3.\nNowadays, there exists optimized algorithms to speedup the computation, including ATLAS, LAPACK, OpenBLAS, GotoBLAS, Intel MKL, Eigen, cuBLAS, clBLAS, etc., which focus on different types of hardware platforms. It is well known that GPUs play an important role in parallel computing. The cuBLAS running on NVIDIA GPU cards, achieves about 3000GFLOPS, which is up to 17x faster than that of MKL on Intel IvyBridge single socket 12 -core E52697 v2 @ 2.70GHz, with single float matrix multiplication on NVIDIA K40M card [3].\nHowever, there are some drawbacks of cuBLAS when do computation of Equation 3, which we call NT operation, compared to Equation 2, named NN operation.\nIn this paper, we test the performance GEMM of cuBLAS on both NN and NT operations, and then we figure out the drawbacks on some cases of cuBLAS. After that, we propose a solution to avoid these poor cases and achieve a better performance to work out Equation 3. Lastly, we exploit our solution to a real-world application Caffe [4] which is a popular deep learning framework and uses cuBLAS to accelerate its operations of matrix-matrix multiplication1. Our experiments show that our solution achieves up to 70% faster than original Caffe in some cases on the GPU of GTX1080.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We introduce the motivation in Section 2, and followed our methodology in Section 3. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. We conclude the paper and discuss our future work in Section 5.\n1Our source codes can be found here: http://github.com/ caffe-optimized\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n03 19\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.D C\n] 1\n0 Fe\nb 20\n17"

      "heading" : "2. Motivation",
      "text" : "On deep neural networks, especially the fully connected networks [5], matrix-matrix multiplication is one of the main operations to do the training of networks. According to findings on fully connected networks in [6], we benchmark the performance of GEMM in NN and NT operations with a set of matrix configurations on the newest generation of NVIDIA GPU card (i.e., GTX 1080 with Pascal architecture) with CUDA-8.0. Table 1 shows our hardware setup for the experiments.\nThe benchmark result is shown in Fig. 1. It can be noted that, in most cases, the performance of NN operation is much better than NT operation. For example, in the case of C = A×BT , where A ∈ R4096×53504 and B ∈ R2048×53504, the performance of NN operation is up to four times better than the NT operation on both GTX1080 card. Therefore, there exists some optimization space to speedup the calculation of Equation 3. Since the performance of NN operation is much better than NT operation, we first propose a naive method (TNN) which does the transpose of matrix B first and then exploits NN operation to finish the calculation of Equation 3. However, the time used on transpose operation may be larger than the difference between NT and NN, which results in the performance of TNN operation could be worse than NT operation. To solve this problem, we propose an SVM-based model to decide to choose the faster operation in calculating Equation 3."

      "heading" : "3.1. Naive Method",
      "text" : "To calculate Equation 3, we replace the one-step NT operation by two-step TNN operation (i.e., transpose B and do NN operation). This method requires extra GPU memory to store BT to perform out-of-place matrix transpose, and the size of memory required is the same with matrix B. The pseudo-code of TNN method is shown in Algorithm 1. Since TNN operation requires the additional transpose on GPU, the time used by transpose operation (Ttranspose(n, k)) should not be larger than differential between NT (TNT (m,n, k)) and NN (TNN (m,n, k)). In other words, to guarantee TTNN (m,n, k) is smaller than TNT (m,n, k)), we have:\nTtranspose(n, k) < TNT (m,n, k)− TNN (m,n, k) (4)\nHowever, the performance of transpose operation is decided by the hardware platform and the size of matrix. It is difficult to guarantee Equation 4 in practical if the difference between TNT (m,n, k)) and TNN (m,n, k) is small enough.\nTherefore, to perform faster calculation of Equation 3, we don not always use TNN instead of NT, which inspires the next method with SVM model.\nAlgorithm 1 TNN 1: procedure TNN(A, B, C, m, n, k) 2: // 1. Allocate GPU memory for transpose of B 3: BT = cudaMemAlloc(n*k*sizeof(float)) 4: // 2. Tranpose B on GPU and store to BT 5: transposeOnGPU(B, n, k, BT) 6: // 3.

From Fig. 1, there exist some cases that the performance of NT is extremely close to or even better than that of NN operation, the TNN method could not achieve better performance than NT, so we should not simply replace NT operation to TNN operation in real application. We propose a model to decide which one to choose to achieve better performance between NT and TNN by the size of matrices. Our method is straight forward, and it consists of two steps. First, we collect history data by testing the results of NT and TNN. Second, machine learning method is applied to train a decision model."

In other words, for all m, n and k (m ∈ S, n ∈ S, k ∈ S), which has 1000 combinations, we test the performances of NT and TNN in calculating Equation 3. Let PNT (m,n, k) and PTNN (m,n, k) denote the performance of NT and TNN respectively with two matrices A and B, where A ∈ Rm×k and B ∈ Rn×k. The difference value between PNT (m,n, k) and PTNN (m,n, k) is denoted by D(m,n, k).\nThe collected data have 1000 records, and each record is with the following format:\nm,n,k,PNT (m,n, k),PTNN (m,n, k),D(m,n, k) The cases that run out of memory are excluded, so the number of total samples is 891, and there are 655 samples with D < 0, and 236 samples with D > 0."

In formal, given input varibles: 〈m,n, k〉, there is a decision function: f , where\nf(m,n, k) = { −1, PNT (m,n, k) < PTNN (m,n, k) +1, PNT (m,n, k) ≥ PTNN (m,n, k)\nIf f(m,n, k) = −1, then we choose TNN, otherwise we choose NT. Our target is to learn the decision function: f with the collected data, which is generalized as a classification problem. The training samples are denoted by X = {〈log2(m), log2(n), log2(k)〉|m,n, k ∈ S}, and the corresponding labels are Y = {f(m,n, k)|m,n, k ∈ S}. The SVM algorithm [7] is applied to solve this decision model. We use libsvm [8] with the kernel of radial basis function. Since the number of positive samples (236) is much smaller than that of negative one (655), the −wi parameter of libsvm is set to be 1.4 to solve the unbalanceddata problem. A 10-fold cross validation is used to test the performance of the model. 90 percentages of samples are used to be the training set, and the others are the testing set."

Among the tested cases, the maximum speedup of TNN method is up to 4.7 times compared to NT method.
