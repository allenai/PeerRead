{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Faster CNNs with Direct Sparse Convolutions and Guided Pruning", "abstract": "Phenomenally successful in practical inference problems, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely deployed in mobile devices, data centers, and even supercomputers. The number of parameters needed in CNNs, however, are often large and undesirable. Consequently, various methods have been developed to prune a CNN once it is trained.  Nevertheless, the resulting CNNs offer limited benefits. While pruning the fully connected layers reduces a CNN's size considerably, it does not improve inference speed noticeably as the compute heavy parts lie in convolutions. Pruning CNNs in a way that increase inference speed often imposes specific sparsity structures, thus limiting the achievable sparsity levels.  We present a method to realize simultaneously size economy and speed improvement while pruning CNNs. Paramount to our success is an efficient general sparse-with-dense matrix multiplication implementation that is applicable to convolution of feature maps with kernels of arbitrary sparsity patterns. Complementing this, we developed a performance model that predicts sweet spots of sparsity levels for different layers and on different computer architectures. Together, these two allow us to demonstrate 3.1-7.3x convolution speedups over dense convolution in AlexNet, on Intel Atom, Xeon, and Xeon Phi processors, spanning the spectrum from mobile devices to supercomputers.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper tackles the problem of compressing trained convnets with the goal of reducing memory overhead and speeding up the forward pass.

Imbuing knowledge of running speed into a pruning algorithm seems like the proper way to tackle this problem. The authors are very methodical in how they build the model and evaluate it very thoroughly.\n\nIt seems that the same idea could be used not just for pruning existing models, but also when building new architectures: selecting layers and their parameters as to achieve an optimal throughput rate. This could make for a nice direction for future work.\n\nOne point that is missing is some discussion of how transferable the performance model is to GPUs. This would make the technique easier to adopt broadly.\n\nOther areas for improvement: The points in Figure 4 are hard to distinguish (e.g. small red circle vs. small red square), and overall the figure could be made bigger; specifying whether the \"base learning rate\" in Section 3 is the start or end rate of the annealing schedule; typos: \"punning\" (p.4), \"spares\" (p.5).\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Impressive empirical results; minimal research contribution", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The authors provide a well engineered solution to exploiting sparsity in convolutional layers of a deep network by recasting it as sparse matrix-vector multiplication.
