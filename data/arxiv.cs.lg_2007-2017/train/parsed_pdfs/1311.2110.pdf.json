      "text" : "Submodularity is a pervasive and important property in the areas of combinatorial optimization, economics, operations research, and game theory. In recent years, submodularity’s use in machine learning has begun to proliferate as well. A set function f : 2V → R over a finite set V = {1, 2, . . . , n} is submodular if for all subsets S, T ⊆ V , it holds that f(S) + f(T ) ≥ f(S ∪ T ) + f(S ∩ T ). Given a set S ⊆ V , we define the gain of an element j /∈ S in the context S as f(j|S) , f(S ∪ j) − f(S). A function f is submodular if it satisfies diminishing marginal returns, namely f(j|S) ≥ f(j|T ) for all S ⊆ T, j /∈ T , and is monotone if f(j|S) ≥ 0 for all j /∈ S, S ⊆ V . The search for optimal algorithms for submodular optimization has seen substantial progress [15, 24, 4] in recent years, but is still an ongoing endeavor. The first polynomial-time algorithm used the ellipsoid method [19, 20], and several combinatorial algorithms followed [27, 22, 14, 23, 26, 48]. For a detailed summary, see [24]. Unlike submodular minimization, submodular maximization is NP hard. However, maximization problems admit constant-factor approximations [46, 51, 12, 4], often even in the constrained case [51, 41, 42, 6, 13, 5]. While submodularity, like convexity, occurs naturally in a wide variety of problems, recent studies have shown that in the general case, many submodular problems of interest are very hard: the problems of learning a submodular function or of submodular minimization under constraints do not even admit constant or logarithmic approximation factors in polynomial time [3, 17, 18, 25, 52]. These rather pessimistic results however stand in sharp contrast to empirical observations, which suggest that these lower bounds are specific to rather contrived classes of functions, whereas much better results can be achieved in many practically relevant cases. Given the increasing importance of submodular functions in machine learning, these observations\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n21 10\nv1 [\ncs .D\nS] 8\nN ov\nbeg the question of qualifying and quantifying properties that make sub-classes of submodular functions more amenable to learning and optimization. Indeed, limited prior work has shown improved results for constrained minimization and learning of sub-classes of submodular functions, including symmetric functions [3, 49], concave functions [17, 37, 47], label cost or covering functions [21, 57]. In this paper, we take additional steps towards addressing the above problems and show how the generic notion of the curvature – the deviation from modularity– of a submodular function determines both upper and lower bounds on approximation factors for many learning and constrained optimization problems. In particular, our quantification tightens the generic, function-independent bounds in [18, 3, 52, 17, 25] for many practically relevant functions. Previously, the concept of curvature has been used to tighten bounds for submodular maximization problems [7, 55]. Hence, our results complete a unifying picture of the effect of curvature on submodular problems. By quantifying the influence of curvature on other problems, we improve previous bounds in [18, 3, 52, 17, 25] for many functions used in applications. Curvature, moreover, does not rely on a specific functional form but generically only on the marginal gains. It allows a smooth transition between the ‘easy’ functions and the ‘really hard’ subclasses of submodular functions."

      "heading" : "2 Problem statements, definitions and background",
      "text" : "Before stating our main results, we provide some necessary definitions and introduce a new concept, the curve normalized version of a submodular function. Throughout this paper, we assume that the submodular function f is defined on a ground set V of n elements, that it is nonnegative and f(∅) = 0. We also use normalized modular (or additive) functions w : 2V → R which are those that can be written as a sum of weights, w(S) = ∑ i∈S w(i). We are concerned with the following three problems:\nProblem 1. (Approximation [18]) Given a submodular function f in form of a value oracle, find an approximation f̂ (within polynomial time and representable within polynomial space), such that for all X ⊆ V , it holds that f̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α1(n)f̂(X) for a polynomial α1(n).\nProblem 2. (PMAC-Learning [3]) Given i.i.d training samples {(Xi, f(Xi)}mi=1 from a distribution D, learn an approximation f̂(X) that is, with probability 1− δ, within a multiplicative factor of α2(n) from f . PMAC learning is defined like PAC learning with the added relaxation that the function is, with high probability, approximated within a factor of α2(n).\nProblem 3. (Constrained optimization [52, 17, 25, 35]) Minimize a submodular function f over a family C of feasible sets, i.e., minX∈C f(X).\nIn its general form, the approximation problem was first studied by Goemans et al. [18], who approximate any monotone submodular function to within a factor of O( √ n log n), with a lower bound of α1(n) = Ω( √ n/ log n). Building on this result, Balcan and Harvey [3] show how to PMAC-learn a monotone submodular function within a factor of α2(n) = O( √ n), and prove a lower bound of Ω(n1/3) for the learning problem. Subsequent work extends these results to sub-additive and fractionally sub-additive functions [2, 1]. Better learning results are possible for the subclass of submodular shells [45] and Fourier sparse set functions [50]. Very recently Devanur et al [11] investigated a related problem of approximating one class of submodular functions with another and they show how many non-monotone submodular functions can be approximated with simple directed graph cuts within a factor of n2/4 which is tight. They also consider problems of approximating symmetric submodular functions and other subclasses of submodular functions. Both Problems 1 and 2 have numerous applications in algorithmic game theory and economics [3, 18] as well as machine learning [3, 44, 45, 50, 34]. For example, applications like bundle pricing, predicting prices of objects or growth rates etc. often have diminishing returns and a natural problem is to estimate these functions [3]. Similarly in machine learning, a number of problems involving sensor placement, summarization and others [44, 30] can be modeled through submodular functions. Often in these scenarios we would want\nto explicitly approximate or learn the true objective. For example in the case of document summarization, we are given the ROUGE scores. Since this function is submodular [44], a natural application is to learn these functions for summarization tasks. Constrained submodular minimization arises in applications such as power assignment or transportation problems [38, 39, 56, 32] . In machine learning, it occurs, for instance, in the form of MAP inference in high-order graphical models [10, 54, 36] or in size-constrained corpus extraction [43]. Recent results show that almost all constraints make it hard to solve the minimization even within a constant factor [52, 16, 35]. Here, we will focus on the constraint of imposing a lower bound on the cardinality, and on combinatorial constraints where C is the set of all s-t paths, s-t cuts, spanning trees, or perfect matchings in a graph."

      "heading" : "2.1 Curvature of a Submodular function",
      "text" : "A central concept in this work is the total curvature κf of a submodular function f and the curvature κf (S) with respect to a set S ⊆ V , defined as [7, 55]\nκf = 1−min j∈V f(j | V \\ j) f(j) , κf (S) = 1−min j∈S f(j|S\\j) f(j) . (1)\nWithout loss of generality, assume that f(j) > 0 for all j ∈ V . This follows since, if there exists an element j ∈ V such that f(j) = 0, we can safely remove element j from the ground set, since for every set X, f(j|X) = 0 (from submodularity), and including or excluding j does not make any difference to the cost function. We also define two alternate notions of curvature. Define κ̂f (S) and κ̃f (S) as,\nκ̂f (S) = 1− ∑ j∈S f(j|S\\j)∑ j∈S f(j) , κ̃f (S) = 1− min T⊆V f(T |S) + ∑ j∈S∪T f(j|S ∪ T\\j) f(T )\n(2)\nThese different forms of curvature are closely related.\nProposition 2.1. For any monotone submodular function and set S ⊆ V ,\nκ̂f (S) ≤ κf (S) ≤ κ̃f (S) ≤ κf (3)\nProof. It is easy to see that κf (S) ≤ κf (V ) = κf , by the fact that κf (S) is a monotone-decreasing set function. To show that κf (S) ≤ κ̃f (S), note that,\nκ̃f (S) = min T⊆V f(T |S) + ∑ j∈S∪T f(j|S ∪ T\\j) f(T )\n≥ min T⊆V :|T |=1 f(T |S) + ∑ j∈S∪T f(j|S ∪ T\\j) f(T )\n≥ min{min j∈S f(j|S\\j) f(j) ,min j /∈S f(j|S) f(j) }\n≥ min j∈S f(j|S\\j) f(j)\n≥ 1− κf (S) (4)\nWe finally prove that κ̂f (S) ≤ κf (S). Note that,\n1− κf (S) = min j∈S f(j|S\\j) f(j)\n≤ f(j|S\\j) f(j) ,∀j ∈ S\nAlso notice that,\n1− κ̂f (S) = ∑ j∈S f(j|S\\j)∑ j∈S f(j)\n≥ ∑ j∈S(1− κf (S))f(j)∑\nj∈S f(j)\n≥ 1− κf (S)\nHence, κ̂f (S) ≤ κf (S).\nHence κ̂f (S) is the tightest notion of curvature. In this paper, we shall see these different notions of curvature coming up in different bounds. A modular function has curvature κf = 0, and a matroid rank function has maximal curvature κf = 1. Intuitively, κf measures how far away f is from being modular. Conceptually, curvature is distinct from the recently proposed submodularity ratio [9] that measures how far a function is from being submodular. Curvature has served to tighten bounds for submodular maximization problems, e.g., from (1− 1/e) to 1κf (1− e −κf ) for monotone submodular maximization subject to a cardinality constraint [7] or matroid constraints [55], and these results are tight. In fact, [55] showed that this result for submodular maximization holds for the tighter version of curvature κ̃f (S\n∗), where S∗ is the optimal solution. In other words, the bound for the greedy algorithm of [55] can be tightened to 1κ̃f (S∗) (1− e −κ̃f (S∗)). For submodular minimization, learning, and approximation, however, the role of curvature has not yet been addressed (an exception are the upper bounds in [32] for minimization). In the following sections, we complete the picture of how curvature affects the complexity of submodular maximization and minimization, approximation, and learning. The above-cited lower bounds for Problems 1–3 were established with functions of maximal curvature (κf = 1) which, as we will see, is the worst case. By contrast, many practically interesting functions have smaller curvature, and our analysis will provide an explanation for the good empirical results observed with such functions [32, 44, 33]. An example for functions with κf < 1 is the class of concave over modular functions that have been used in speech processing [44] and computer vision [36]. This class comprises, for instance,\nfunctions of the form f(X) = ∑k i=1(wi(X))\na, for some a ∈ [0, 1] and a nonnegative weight vectors wi. Such functions may be defined over clusters Ci ⊆ V , in which case the weights wi(j) are nonzero only if j ∈ Ci [44, 36, 30]. A related quantity distinct from curvature that has been introduced in the machine learning community is the submodularity ratio [9]:\nγU,k(f) = min L⊆U,S:|S|≤k,S∩L=∅ ∑ x∈S f(x|L) f(S|L)\n(5)\nThis parameter shows the decay of approximation bounds when an algorithm for submodular maximization is applied to non-submodular functions. The submodularity ratio measures how “close” f is to submodularity, and helps characterize theoretical bounds for functions which are approximately submodular. Curvature, by contrast, measures how close a submodular function to being modular."

      "heading" : "2.2 The Curve-normalized Polymatroid function",
      "text" : "To analyze Problems 1 – 3, we introduce the concept of a curve-normalized polymatroid1. Specifically, we define the κf -curve-normalized version of f as\nfκ(X) = f(X)− (1− κf )\n∑ j∈X f(j)\nκf (6)\n1A polymatroid function is a monotone increasing, nonnegative, submodular function satisfying f(∅) = 0.\nIf κf = 0, then we set f κ ≡ 0. We call fκ the curve-normalized version of f because its curvature is κfκ = 1. The function f κ allows us to decompose a submodular function f into a “difficult” polymatroid function and an “easy” modular part as f(X) = fdifficult(X) +measy(X) where fdifficult(X) = κff κ(X) and\nmeasy(X) = (1 − κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j). Moreover, we may modulate the curvature of given any function g with κg = 1, by constructing a function f(X) , cg(X) + (1− c)|X| with curvature κf = c but otherwise the same polymatroidal structure as g. Our curvature-based decomposition is different from decompositions such as that into a totally normalized function and a modular function [8]. Indeed, the curve-normalized function has some specific properties that will be useful later on :\nLemma 2.1. If f is monotone submodular with κf > 0, then f(X) ≤ ∑ j∈X f(j), f(X) ≥ (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j). (7)\nProof. The inequalities follow from submodularity and monotonicity of f . The first part follows from the subadditivity of f . The second inequality follows since f(X) ≥ ∑ j∈X f(j|V \\j) ≥ (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j), since ∀j ∈ X, f(j|V \\j) ≥ (1− κf )f(j) by definition of κf .\nLemma 2.2. If f is monotone submodular, then fκ(X) in Eqn. (6) is a monotone non-negative submodular function. Furthermore, fκ(X) ≤ ∑ j∈X f(j).\nProof. Submodularity of fκ is evident from the definition. To show the monotonicity, it suffices to show that f(X)− (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) is monotone non-decreasing and non-negative submodular. To show it is non-decreasing, notice that ∀j /∈ X, f(j|V \\j) − (1 − κf )f(j) ≥ 0, since (1 − κf )f(j) ≤ f(j|V \\j) by the definition of κf . Non-negativity follows from monotonicity and the fact that f\nκ(∅) = 0. To show the second part, notice that f(X)−(1−κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\nκf ≤\n∑ j∈X f(j)−(1−κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) κf = ∑ j∈X f(j)."

      "heading" : "2.3 A framework for curvature-dependent lower bounds.",
      "text" : "The function fκ will be our tool for analyzing the hardness of submodular problems. Previous informationtheoretic lower bounds for Problems 1–3 [16, 18, 25, 52] are independent of curvature and use functions with κf = 1. These curvature-independent bounds are proven by constructing two essentially indistinguishable matroid rank functions h and fR, one of which depends on a random set R ⊆ V . One then argues that any algorithm would need to make a super-polynomial number of queries to the functions for being able to distinguish h and fR with high enough probability. The lower bound will be the ratio maxX∈C h(X)/f\nR(X). We extend this proof technique to functions with a fixed given curvature. To this end, we define the functions\nfRκ (X) = κff R(X) + (1− κf )|X| and hκ(X) = κfh(X) + (1− κf )|X|. (8)\nBoth of these functions have curvature κf . This construction enables us to explicitly introduce the effect of curvature into information-theoretic bounds for all monotone submodular functions.\nMain results. The curve normalization (6) leads to refined upper bounds for Problems 1–3, while the curvature modulation (8) provides matching lower bounds. The following are some of our main results: for approximating submodular functions (Problem 1), we replace the known bound of α1(n) = O( √ n log n) [18] by an improved curvature-dependent O( √ n logn\n1+( √ n logn−1)(1−κf ) ). We complement this with a lower bound\nof Ω̃( √ n\n1+( √ n−1)(1−κf ) ). For learning submodular functions (Problem 2), we refine the known bound of\nα2(n) = O( √ n) [3] in the PMAC setting to a curvature dependent bound of O(\n√ n\n1+( √ n−1)(1−κf ) ), with a lower\nbound of Ω̃( n 1/3\n1+(n1/3−1)(1−κf ) ). Finally, Table 1 summarizes our curvature-dependent approximation bounds for\nconstrained minimization (Problem 3). These bounds refine many of the results in [16, 52, 25, 35]. In general, our new curvature-dependent upper and lower bounds refine known theoretical results whenever κf < 1, in many cases replacing known polynomial bounds by a curvature-dependent constant factor 1/(1 − κf ). Besides making these bounds precise, the decomposition and the curve-normalized version (6) are the basis for constructing tight algorithms that (up to logarithmic factors) achieve the lower bounds."

      "heading" : "3 Approximating submodular functions everywhere",
      "text" : "We first address improved bounds for the problem of approximating a monotone submodular function everywhere. Previous work established α-approximations g to a submodular function f satisfying g(S) ≤ f(S) ≤ αg(S) for all S ⊆ V [18]. We begin with a theorem showing how any algorithm computing such an approximation may be used to obtain a curvature-specific, improved approximation. Note that the curvature of a monotone submodular function can be obtained within 2n+ 1 queries to f . The key idea of Theorem 3.1 is to only approximate the curved part of f , and to retain the modular part exactly.\nTheorem 3.1. Given a polymatroid function f with κf < 1, let f κ be its curve-normalized version defined in Equation (6), and let f̂κ be a submodular function satisfying f̂κ(X) ≤ fκ(X) ≤ α(n)f̂κ(X), for some X ⊆ V . Then the function f̂(X) , κf f̂κ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) satisfies\nf̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α(n) 1 + (α(n)− 1)(1− κf ) f̂(X) ≤ f̂(X) 1− κf .

To show the second inequality, note that\nf̂κ(X) ≥ f κ(X) α(n) , and therefore\nf(X) κf f̂κ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) = κff\nκ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\nκf f̂κ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\n(10)\n≤ κff\nκ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\nκf fκ α(n) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\n(11)\n= α(n) κff\nκ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\nκffκ + (1− κf )α(n) ∑ j∈X f(j)\n(12)\n= α(n)\n1 + (α(n)−1)(1−κf )\n∑ j∈X f(j)\nκffκ(X)+(1−κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\n(13)\n≤ α(n) 1 + (α(n)− 1)(1− κf )\n(14)\nThe last inequality follows since κff κ(X) + (1 − κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ ∑ j∈X f(j). The other inequalities in Eqn. (9) follow directly from the definitions. It is also easy to see that all the above inequalities will hold using an upper bound κ̄f > κf instead of κf in the definition of the curve-normalized function. The bound in that case would be,\nf̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α(n) 1 + (α(n)− 1)(1− κ̄f ) f̂(X) ≤ f̂(X) 1− κ̄f\n(15)\nwhere, f̂(X) = κ̄f f̂ ¯κ(X) + (1− κ̄f ) ∑ j∈X f(j), f̂\n¯κ is an approximation of f κ̄ satisfying f̂ ¯κ(X) ≤ fκ(X) ≤ α(n)f̂κ(X) and,\nf κ̄(X) = f(X)− (1− κ̄f )\n∑ j∈X f(j)\nκ̄f (16)\nTheorem 3.1 may be directly applied to tighten recent results on approximating submodular functions everywhere. An algorithm by Goemans et al. [18] computes an approximation to a polymatroid function f in polynomial time by approximating the submodular polyhedron via an ellipsoid. This approximation (which we call the ellipsoidal approximation) satisfies α(n) = O( √ n log n), and has the form √ wf (X) for a certain weight vector wf .\nTheorem 3.2 ([18]). For any polymatroid rank function f , one can compute a weight vector wf and correspondingly an approximation √ wf (X) via a polynomial number of oracle queries such that √ wf (X) ≤ f(X) ≤ O( √ n log n) √ wf (X).\nThe weights wf are computed via an ellipsoidal approximation of the submodular polyhedron [18]. Corollary 3.3 states that a tighter approximation is possible for functions with κf < 1.\nCorollary 3.3. Let f be a polymatroid function with κf < 1, and let √ wfκ(X) be the ellipsoidal approx-\nimation to the κ-curve-normalized version fκ(X) of f . Then the function fea(X) = κf √ wfκ(X) + (1 −\nκf ) ∑ j∈X f(j) satisfies\nfea(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ O ( √ n log n\n1 + ( √ n log n− 1)(1− κf )\n) fea(X). (17)\nIf κf = 0, then the approximation is exact. This is not surprising since a modular function can be inferred exactly within O(n) oracle calls.\nProof. To compute fea, construct the function fκ as in Equation (6), and apply the algorithm in [18] to construct the approximation √ wfκ(X) such that √ wfκ(X) ≤ fκ(X) ≤ O( √ n log n) √ wfκ(X). Note that√\nwfκ(X) is an approximation of fκ and not f . Then define fea(X) , κf (X)fea(X)+(1−κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j)\nThe following lower bound shows that Corollary 3.3 is tight up to logarithmic factors. It refines the lower bound in [18] to include κf .\nTheorem 3.4. Given a submodular function f with curvature κf , there does not exist a (possibly randomized) polynomial-time algorithm that computes an approximation to f within a factor of n 1/2−\n1+(n1/2− −1)(1−κf ) , for\nany > 0.\nProof. The information-theoretic proof uses a construction and argumentation similar to that in [18, 52], but perturbs the functions to have the desired curvature. In the following let κf = κ. Define two monotone submodular functions h\nκ(X) = κmin{|X|, α}+ (1− κ)|X| and fRκ (X) = κmin{β + |X ∩ R̄|, |X ∩ R|, α}+ (1 − κ)|X|, where R ⊆ V is a random set of cardinality α. Let α and β be an integer such that α = x √ n/5 and β = x2/5 for an x2 = ω(log n). Both hκ and fRκ have curvature equal to κf = κ. Using a Chernoff bound, one can then show that any algorithm that uses a polynomial number of queries can distinguish hκ and fRκ with probability only n\n−ω(1), and therefore cannot reliably distinguish the functions with a polynomial number of queries [52]. Therefore, any such algorithm will, with high probability, approximate hκ and fRκ by the same function f̂ . Since the approximation must hold for both functions, the approximation factor must satisfy hκ(R) ≤ γf̂(R) ≤ γfRκ (R), and is therefore lower bounded by h κ(R)/fRκ (R). Given an arbitrary > 0, set x 2 = n2 = ω(log n). Then\nhκ(R) fRκ (R) =\nα\n(1− κ)α+ κβ (18)\n= n1/2+\n(1− κ)n1/2+ + κn2 (19)\n= n1/2−\n1 + (n1/2− − 1)(1− κ) . (20)\nAssume there was an algorithm that generates an approximation f̂ ′ with approximation factor γ′ < γ. This would imply that hκ(R)/fRκ (R) < γ ′, but this contradicts the above derivation.\nThe simplest alternative approximation to f one might conceive is the modular function f̂m(X) , ∑ j∈X f(j) which can easily be computed by querying the n values f(j).\nLemma 3.1. Given a monotone submodular function f , it holds that\nf(X) ≤ f̂m(X) = ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ |X| 1 + (|X| − 1)(1− κf (X)) f(X) (21)\nMoreover, it also holds that,\nf(X) ≤ f̂m(X) = ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ |X| 1 + (|X| − 1)(1− κ̂f (X)) f(X) (22)\nProof. We first show the result for κ̂f (X), and since it is a stronger notion of curvature, the bound will hold for κf (X) as well. We shall use the following facts, which follow from the definitions of submodularity and curvature.\nFact 1: (1− κ̂f (X)) ∑ j∈X f(j) = ∑ j∈X f(j|X\\j), (23)\nFact 2: f(X)− f(k) ≥ ∑ j∈X\\k f(j|X\\j),∀k ∈ X. (24)\nSum the expressions from Fact 2, ∀k ∈ X, use Fact 1, and we obtain the following series of inequalities,\n|X|f(X)− ∑ k∈X f(k) ≥ ∑ k∈X ∑ j∈X\\k f(j|X\\j)\n≥ ∑ k∈X ∑ j∈X f(j|X\\j)− ∑ k∈X f(j|X\\k)\n≥ (|X| − 1) ∑ j∈X\\k f(j|X\\j)\n≥ (|X| − 1)(1− κ̂f (X)) ∑ k∈X f(k)\nHence we obtain that, ∑ k∈X f(k) ≤ |X| 1 + (|X| − 1)(1− κ̂f (X)) f(X)\nFrom the fact that 1− κ̂f (X) ≥ 1− κf (X), it immediately follows that,∑ k∈X f(k) ≤ |X| 1 + (|X| − 1)(1− κf (X)) f(X)\nThe form of Lemma 3.1 is slightly different from Corollary 3.3. However, there is a straightforward correspondence: given f̂ such that f̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α′(n)f̂(X), by defining f̂ ′(X) = α′(n)f̂(X), we get that f(X) ≤ f̂ ′(X) ≤ α′(n)f(X). Lemma 3.1 for the modular approximation is complementary to Corollary 3.3: First, the modular approximation is better whenever |X| ≤ √ n. Second, the bound in Lemma 3.1 depends on the curvature κf (X) with respect to the set X, which is stronger than κf . Third, f̂ m is extremely simple to compute. For sets of larger cardinality, however, the ellipsoidal approximation of Corollary 3.3 provides a better approximation, in fact, the best possible one (Theorem 3.4). In a similar manner, Lemma 3.1 is tight for any modular approximation to a submodular function:\nLemma 3.2. For any κ > 0, there exists a monotone submodular function f with curvature κ such that no modular upper bound on f ,f̂(X) = ∑ j∈X w(j) ≥ f(X),∀X ⊆ V , can approximate f(X) to a factor better than |X|1+(|X|−1)(1−κf ) .\nProof. Let fκ(X) = κmin{|X|, 1}+ (1 − κ)|X|. Then fκ(X) = κ + (1 − κ)|X| = 1 + (1 − κ)(|X| − 1) for all ∅ ⊂ X ⊆ V . Since f̂m is an upper bound, it must satisfy f̂(j) = w(j) ≥ 1 for all j ∈ V . Therefore, f̂m(X) = |X|, X 6= ∅.\nThe improved curvature dependent bounds immediately imply better bounds for the class of concave over modular functions used in [44, 36, 30].\nCorollary 3.5. Given weight vectors w1, · · · , wk ≥ 0, and a submodular function f(X) = ∑k i=1 λi[wi(X)]\na, λi ≥ 0, for a ∈ (0, 1), it holds that f(X) ≤ ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ |X|1−af(X)\nProof. We first show this result independent of curvature, and then show how the curvature dependent bound also implies this improved bound. First define f(X) = [w(X)]a, for a ∈ (0, 1] and w ≥ 0. since xa is a concave function for a ∈ (0, 1], we have from Jensen’s inequality that, given x1, x2, · · · , xn ≥ 0,∑n\ni=1 x a i n ≤ (∑n i=1 xi n )a Notice that, when f(X) = [w(X)]a, we have that f(i) = w(i)a. Hence ∑ j∈X f(i) = ∑ i∈X w(i)\na. Hence from the inequality above, it directly holds that,∑\ni∈X w(i) a\n|X| ≤\n[ ∑ i∈X w(i)] a\n|X|a\nand hence, ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ |X|1−af(X). This inequality also holds for a sum of concave over modular functions, since for each wi ≥ 0, we have ∑ j∈X wi(j) a ≤ |X|1−awi(X)a. (25) Moreover, when f(X) = ∑k i=1 λi[wi(X)] a, the modular upper bound ∑ j∈X f(j) = ∑ j∈X ∑k i=1 λi[wi(j)]\na. Summing up eqn. (26) for all i, we have that,\nk∑ i=1 ∑ j∈X λiwi(j) a ≤ |X|1−a k∑ i=1 λiwi(X) a. (26)\nWe next show that this result can also be seen from the curvature of the function. Lemma 3.3. Given weight vectors w1, · · · , wk ≥ 0, and a submodular function f(X) = ∑k i=1 λi[wi(X)]\na, λi ≥ 0, for a ∈ (0, 1], it holds that,\nκ̂f (X) ≤ 1− a\n|X|1−a (27)\nProof. Again, let f(X) = [w(X)]a, for w ≥ 0 and a ∈ (0, 1]. Then,\nf(j|X\\j) = f(X)− f(X\\j) = [w(X)]a − [w(X)− w(j)]a\n≥ aw(j) w(X)1−a\nThe last inequality again holds due to concavity of g(x) = xa. In particular, for a concave function, g(y) − g(x) ≤ g′(x)(y − x), where g′ is the derivative of g. Hence g(x) ≥ g(y) + g′(x)(x − y). Substitute y = w(X)− w(j), x = w(X) and g(x) = xa, and we get the above expression.\nHence we have,\n1− κ̂f (X) = ∑ j∈X f(j|X\\j)∑\nj∈X f(j) ≥ a ∑ j∈X w(j)w(X)\na−1∑ j∈X w(j) a\n≥ aw(X) a∑\nj∈X w(j) a\n≥ a |X|1−a\nThe last inequality follows from the previous Lemma.\nHence from the curvature dependent bound, we obtain a slightly weaker bound, which still gives a O(|X|1−a) bound for the modular upper bound. ∑\nj∈X f(j) ≤ 1 1− κ̂f (X) f(X)\n≤ |X| 1−a\na f(X)\n≤ O(|X|1−a)f(X)\nIn particular, when a = 1/2, the modular upper bound approximates the sum of square-root over modular functions by a factor of √ |X|."

      "text" : "We next address the problem of learning submodular functions in a PMAC setting [3]. The PMAC (Probably Mostly Approximately Correct) framework is an extension of the PAC framework [53] to allow multiplicative errors in the function values from a fixed but unknown distribution D over 2V . We are given training samples {(Xi, f(Xi)}mi=1 drawn i.i.d. from D. The algorithm may take time polynomial in n, 1/ , 1/δ to compute a (polynomially-representable) function f̂ that is a good approximation to f with respect to D. Formally, f̂ must satisfy that\nPrX1,X2,··· ,Xm∼D [ PrX∈D[f̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α(n)f̂(X)] ≥ 1− ] ≥ 1− δ (28)\nfor some approximation factor α(n). Balcan and Harvey [3] propose an algorithm that PMAC-learns any monotone, nonnegative submodular function within a factor α(n) = √ n+ 1 by reducing the problem to that of learning a binary classifier. If we assume that we have an upper bound on the curvature κf , or that we can estimate it 2, and have access to the value of the singletons f(j), j ∈ V , then we can obtain better learning results with non-maximal curvature:\nLemma 4.1. Let f be a monotone submodular function for which we know an upper bound on its curvature and the singleton weights f(j) for all j ∈ V . For every , δ > 0 there is an algorithm that uses a polynomial number of training examples, runs in time polynomial in (n, 1/ , 1/δ) and PMAC-learns f within a factor of√ n+1 1+( √ n+1−1)(1−κf ) . If D is a product distribution, then there exists an algorithm that PMAC-learns f within a factor of O( log 1\n1+(log 1 −1)(1−κf ) ).\n2note that κf can be estimated from a set of 2n+ 1 samples {(j, f(j))}j∈V , {(V, f(V ))}, and {(V \\j, f(V \\j)}j∈V included in the training samples\nThe algorithm of Lemma 4.1 uses the reduction of Balcan and Harvey [3] to learn the κf -curve-normalized version fκ of f . From the learned function f̂κ(X), we construct the final estimate f̂(X) , κf f̂κ(X) + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j). Theorem 3.1 implies Lemma 4.1 for this f̂(X).\nProof. The proof of this theorem directly follows from the results in [3] and those from section 3. The idea is that, we use the PMAC setting and algorithm from [3]. We use the same construction as section 3, and construct the function fκ(X) which is the curve-normalized version of f . Let f̂κ(X) be the function learn\nfrom fκ using the algorithm from [3]. Then define f̂(X) = (1− κf )f̂κ(X) + κf ∑ j∈X f(j) and an analysis similar to that in section 3 conveys that the function f̂ is within a factor of √ n+1\n1+( √ n+1−1)(1−κf ) . Note that\nmoreover, whenever the bound f̂κ(X) ≤ fκ(X) ≤ √ n+ 1f̂κ(X), the above curvature dependent bound will also hold. Hence the curvature dependent bound holds with high probability on a large measure of sets. The case for product distributions also follows from very similar lines and the results from [3].\nLemma 4.1 is tight as we show below.\nLemma 4.2. Given a class of submodular functions with curvature κf , there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm (which possibly even has information about κf ) that is guaranteed to PMAC-learn f for every\n, δ > 0 within a factor of n 1/3− ′\n1+(n1/3− ′−1)(1−κf ) , for any ′ > 0.\nProof. Again, we use the same matroid functions used in [3]. Notice that the construction of [3], provides a family of matroids and a collection of sets B, with |A| = n1/3, such that f(A) = |A|, A ∈ B and f(A) = β = ω(log n), A /∈ B. Again set β = n ′ , and using a analysis and construction similar to the hardness proof of section 3 and Theorem 9 from [3] conveys that the lower bound for this problem is Ω̃( n 1/3\n1+(n1/3−1)(1−κf ) )\nWe end this section by showing how we can learn with a construction analogous to that in Lemma 3.1.\nLemma 4.3. If f is a monotone submodular function with known curvature (or a known upper bound) κ̂f (X),∀X ⊆ V , then for every , δ > 0 there is an algorithm that uses a polynomial number of training examples, runs in time polynomial in (n, 1/ , 1/δ) and PMAC learns f(X) within a factor of 1+ |X|1+(|X|−1)(1−κ̂f (X)) .\nBefore proving this result, we compare this result to Lemma 4.1. Lemma 4.3 leads to better bounds for small sets, whereas Lemma 4.1 provides a better general bound. Moreover, in contrast to Lemma 4.1, here we only need an upper bound on the curvature and do not need to know the singleton weights {f(j), j ∈ V }. Note also that, while κf itself is an upper bound of κ̂f (X), often one does have an upper bound on κ̂f (X) if one knows the function class of f (for example, say concave over modular). In particular, an immediate corollary\nis that the class of concave over modular functions f(X) = ∑k i=1 λi[wi(X)]\na, λi ≥ 0, for a ∈ (0, 1) can be learnt within a factor of min{ √ n+ 1, 1 + |X|1−a}.\nProof. To prove this result, we adapt Algorithm 2 in [3] to curvature and modular approximations. Following their arguments, we reduce the problem of learning a submodular function to that of learning a linear seperator, while separately handling the subset of instances where f is zero. We detail the parts where our proof deviates from [3]. We divide 2V into the support set S = {X ⊆ V | f(X) > 0} of f and its complement Z = {X ⊆ V | f(X) = 0}. Using samples from D′, we generate new, binary labeled samples from a distribution D′ on {0, 1}n ×R that will be used to learn the linear separator. These samples differ slightly from those in [3]. Let\nα(X) = |X|\n1 + (|X| − 1)(1− κ̂f (X)) . (29)\nTo sample from D′, we repeatedly sample from D until we obtain a set X ∈ S. For each such X, we flip a fair coin and, with equal probability, generate a sample point from D′ as\nx = (1X , f(X)) and label y = +1 if heads (30)\nx = (1X , (α(X) + 1)f(X)) and label y = −1 if tails. (31)\nWe observe that the generated positive and negative sample are linearly separable with the separator u = (w,−1), where w(j) = 0 if f(j) = 0, and w(j) = f(j)+δ if f(j) > 0, with δ such that 0 < δ < minj∈S f(Xj)/n:\nu>(1X , f(X)) = ∑ j∈X f(j) + δ|X| − f(X) > 0 (32)\nu>(1X , (α(X) + 1)f(X)) = ∑ j∈X f(j) + δ|X| − (α(X) + 1)f(X) < 0 (33)\nfor all X ⊆ V . The second inequality holds since ∑ j∈X f(j) ≤ α(X)f(X) and δ|X| ≤ δn < f(X). (For points in Z, we have that u>(1X , f(X)) = 0.) The final algorithm generates a sample from D′ for each sample X ∈ S from D. For each X ∈ Z, it adds the constraint that w(j) = 0 for all j ∈ X. We then find a linear separator u = (w,−z) and output the function f̂(X) , w(X)/z. This is possible by the above arguments. This function satisfies the approximation constraints for the set Y of all training points X ∈ S for which both generated samples are labeled correctly: the correct labelings w(X)−zf(X) > 0 and w(X)−z(α(X)+1)f(X) < 0 imply that\nf(X) ≤ ˆf(X) = w(X) z ≤ (α(X) + 1)f(X). (34)\nSimilarly, the constraints on w imply that the same holds for any subset of the union of the training samples in Z. It remains to show that for sufficiently many, i.e., ` = 16n log(\nn δ ) samples, the sets S \\Y and Z \\ ⋃ Xi∈Z,i≤`Xi\nhave small (at most 1− 2 ) measure. This follows from Claim 5 in [3]."

      "heading" : "5 Constrained submodular minimization",
      "text" : "Next, we apply our results to the minimization of submodular functions under constraints. Most algorithms for constrained minimization use one of two strategies: they apply a convex relaxation [25, 35], or they\noptimize a surrogate function f̂ that should approximate f well [16, 18, 35]. We follow the second strategy and propose a new, widely applicable curvature-dependent choice for surrogate functions. A suitable selection of f̂ will ensure theoretically optimal results. Throughout this section, we refer to the optimal solution as X∗ ∈ argminX∈C f(X).\nLemma 5.1. Given a submodular function f , let f̂1 be an approximation of f such that f̂1(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α(n)f̂1(X), for all X ⊆ V . Then any minimizer X̂1 ∈ argminX∈C f̂(X) of f̂ satisfies f(X̂) ≤ α(n)f(X∗). Likewise, if an approximation of f is such that f(X) ≤ f̂2(X) ≤ α(X)f(X) for a set-specific factor α(X), then its minimizer X̃2 ∈ argminX∈C f̂2(X) satisfies f(X̂2) ≤ α(X∗)f(X∗). If only β-approximations3 are possible for minimizing f̂1 or f̂2 over C, then the final bounds are βα(n) and βα(X∗) respectively.\n3A β-approximation algorithm for minimizing a function g finds set X : g(X) ≤ βminX∈C g(X)\nProof. We prove the first part and the second part similarly follows. Given that,\nf̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ α(n)f̂(X) (35)\nThen, if X̂ is the optimal solution for minimizing f̂ over C. We then have that,\nf(X̂) ≤ α(n)f̂(X̂) ≤ α(n)f̂(X∗) ≤ α(n)f(X∗) (36)\nwhere X∗ is the optimal solution of f .\nFor Lemma 5.1 to be practically useful, it is essential that f̂1 and f̂2 be efficiently optimizable over C. We discuss two general curvature-dependent approximations that work for a large class of combinatorial constraints. In particular, we use Theorem 3.1: we decompose f into fκ and a modular part fm, and then approximate fκ while retaining fm, i.e., f̂ = f̂κ + fm. The first approach uses a simple modular upper bound (MUB) and the second relies on the Ellipsoidal approximation (EA) we used in Section 3. MUB: The simplest approximation to a submodular function is the modular approximation f̂m(X) ,∑ j∈X f(j) ≥ f(X). Since here, f̂κ happens to be equivalent to fm, we obtain the overall approximation f̂ = f̂m. Lemmas 5.1 and 3.1 directly imply a set-dependent approximation factor for f̂m:\nCorollary 5.1. Let X̂ ∈ C be a β-approximate solution for minimizing ∑ j∈X f(j) over C, i.e. ∑ j∈X̂ f(j) ≤\nβminX∈C ∑ j∈X f(j). Then\nf(X̂) ≤ β|X ∗|\n1 + (|X∗| − 1)(1− κf (X∗)) f(X∗). (37)\nCorollary 5.1 has also been shown in [32]. Thanks to Lemma 3.1 and the second part of Lemma 5.1, however, we can provide a much simpler proof. Similar to the algorithms in [32, 29, 31], MUB can be extended to an iterative algorithm yielding performance gains in practice. In particular, Corollary 5.1 implies improved approximation bounds for practically relevant concave over modular functions, such as those used in [36].\nFor instance, for f(X) = ∑k i=1 √∑ j∈X wi(j), we obtain a worst-case approximation bound of √ |X∗| ≤ √ n. This is significantly better than the worst case factor of |X∗| for general submodular functions. EA: Instead of employing a modular upper bound, we can approximate fκ using the construction by Goemans et al. [18], as in Corollary 3.3. In that case, f̂(X) = κf √ wfκ(X) + (1 − κf )fm(X) has a special form: a weighted sum of a concave function and a modular function. Minimizing such a function over constraints C is harder than minimizing a merely modular function, but with the algorithm in [47] we obtain an FPTAS4 for minimizing f̂ over C whenever we can minimize a nonnegative linear function over C.\nCorollary 5.2. For a submodular function with curvature κf < 1, algorithm EA will return a solution X̂ that satisfies f(X̂) ≤ O ( √ n log n\n( √ n log n− 1)(1− κf ) + 1)\n) f(X∗). (38)\nProof. We use the important result from [47] where they show that any function of the form λ1 √ m1(X) + λ2m2(X) where λ1 ≥ 0, λ2 ≥ 0 and m1 and m2 are positive modular functions, has a FPTAS, provided a modular function can easily be optimized over C. Notice that our function is exactly of that form. Hence f̂(X) can be approximately optimized over C. This bound then translates into the approximation guarantee using Corollary 3.3 and the first part of Lemma 5.1.\n4The FPTAS will yield a β = (1 + )-approximation through an algorithm polynomial in 1 .\nNext, we apply the results of this section to specific optimization problems, for which we show (mostly tight) curvature-dependent upper and lower bounds. Cardinality lower bounds (SLB). A simple constraint is a lower bound on the cardinality of the solution, i.e., C = {X ⊆ V : |X| ≥ k}. Svitkina and Fleischer [52] prove that for monotone submodular functions of arbitrary curvature, it is impossible to find a polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation factor better than √ n/ log n. They show an algorithm which matches this approximation factor.\nObservation 5.1. For the SLB problem, Algorithm EA and MUB are guaranteed to be no worse than factors of O( √ n logn\n1+( √ n logn−1)(1−κf ) ) and k1+(k−1)(1−κf ) respectively.\nThe guarantee for MUB follows directly from Corollary 5.1, by observing that |X∗| = k. We also show a similar asymptotic hardness result, which is quite close to the bounds in observation 5.1. These bounds are improvements over the results of [52] whenever κf < 1. Here, MUB is preferable to EA whenever k is small. The following theorem shows that the bound for EA is tight up to poly-log factors.\nTheorem 5.3. For κf < 1 and any > 0, there exists submodular functions with curvature κf such that no poly-time algorithm achieves an approx. factor of n 1/2−\n1+(n1/2− −1)(1−κf ) for the SLB problem.\nProof. The proof of this theorem is analogous to that of theorem 3.4. Define two monotone submodular functions hκ(X) = κf min{|X|, α}+ (1− κf )|X| and fRκ (X) = κf min{β + |X| ∩ R̄|, |X|, α}+ (1− κf )|X|, where R ⊆ V is a random set of cardinality α. Let α and β be an integer such that α = x √ n/5 and β = x2/5 for an x2 = ω(log n). Also we assume that k = α in this case. Both hκ and f R κ have curvature κf . Given an arbitrary > 0, set x2 = n2 = ω(log n). Then the ratio between fRκ and g κf is n 1/2−\n1+(n1/2− −1)(1−κf ) . Clearly\nthen if any algorithm can achieve better than this bound, it can distinguish between fR and g which is a contradiction.\nIn the following problems, our ground set V consists of the set of edges in a graph G = (V, E) with two distinct nodes s, t ∈ V and n = |V|, m = |E|. The submodular function is f : 2E → R. Shortest submodular s-t path (SSP). Here, we aim to find an s-t path X of minimum (submodular) length f(X). Goel et al. [16] show a O(n2/3)-approximation with matching curvature-independent lower bound Ω(n2/3). By Corollary 5.1, the curvature-dependent worst-case bound for MUB is n1+(n−1)(1−κf ) since any minimal s-t path has at most n edges. Similarly, the factor for EA is O( √ m logm\n1+( √ m logm−1)(1−κf ) ). The\nbound of EA will be tighter for sparse graphs while MUB provides better results for dense ones. We can also show the following curvature-dependent lower bound:\nTheorem 5.4. Given a submodular function with a curvature κf > 0 and any > 0, no polynomial-time algorithm achieves an approximation factor better than n 2/3−\n1+(n2/3− −1)(1−κf ) for the SSP problem.\nProof. The proof of this follows in very similar lines to the earlier lower bounds using our construction and the matroid constructions in [16]. The main idea is to use their multilevel graph, but define adjusted versions of their cost functions. In particular, define h(X) = κf min{|X|, α} + (1 − κf )|X| and fR(X) = κf min{β + |X| ∩ R̄|, |X|, α}+ (1− κf )|X|. In this context R is a randomly chosen s-t path of length n2/3 and α = n2/3. Similarly the value of β = n . The Chernoff bounds then show that the two functions above are indistinguishable (with high probability) and hence the ratio of the two functions h and fR then provides the hardness result.\nMinimum submodular s-t cut (SSC): This problem, also known as the cooperative cut problem [35, 36], asks to minimize a monotone submodular function f such that the solution X ⊆ E is a set of edges whose removal disconnects s from t in G. Using curvature refines the lower bound in [35]:\nTheorem 5.5. No polynomial-time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better than n 1/2−\n1+(n1/2− −1)(1−κf ) ,\nfor any > 0, for the SSC problem with a submodular function of curvature κf .\nProof. This proof follows along the lines of the results shown above. It uses the construction from [35]. Corollary 5.1 implies an approximation factor of O( √ m logm\n( √ m logm−1)(1−κf )+1 ) for EA and a factor of m1+(m−1)(1−κf ) for MUB, where m = |E| is the number of edges in the graph. By Theorem 5.5, the factor for EA is tight for sparse graphs. Specifically for cut problems, there is yet another useful surrogate function that is exact on local neighborhoods. Jegelka and Bilmes [35] demonstrate how this approximation may be optimized via a generalized maximum flow algorithm that maximizes a polymatroidal network flow [40]. This algorithm still applies to the combination f̂ = κf f̂ κ + (1 − κf )fm, where we only approximate fκ. We refer to this approximation as Polymatroidal Network Approximation (PNA).\nCorollary 5.6. Algorithm PNA achieves a worst-case approximation factor of n2+(n−2)(1−κf ) for the cooperative cut problem.\nFor dense graphs, this factor is theoretically tighter than that of the EA approximation.\nProof. We use the polymatroidal network flow construction from [35], where the approximation f̂ is defined via a partition of the ground set, and is separable over groups of edges. This approximation can be solved efficiently via generalized flows in polynomial time [34, 35]. Moreover adding a modular term (for the modulation) does not increase the complexity of the problem. This approximation satisfies fκ(X) ≤ f̂κ(X) ≤ n2 f κ(X) for all cuts X ∈ C.We then convert this expression in the form of Theorem 3.1 as 2f̂ κ(X) n ≤ f κ(X) ≤ f̂κ(X). Then define f̂(X) , κf 2 ˆfκ(X) n + (1− κf ) ∑ j∈X f(j), and using theorem 3.1, it implies that:\nf̂(X) ≤ f(X) ≤ n 2 + (n− 2)(1− κf ) f(X) (39)\nThen let X̂ be the minimizer of f̂(X) over C (using the generalized flows [35]). It then follows that (let α = n2+(n−2)(1−κf ) ): f(X̂) ≤ αf̂(X̂) ≤ αf̂(X ∗) ≤ f(X∗) where X∗ is the optimal solution of f over C.\nMinimum submodular spanning tree (SST). Here, C is the family of all spanning trees in a given graph G. Such constraints occur for example in power assignment problems [56]. Goel et al. [16] show a curvature-independent optimal approximation factor of O(n) for this problem.\nObservation 5.2. For the minimum submodular spanning tree problem, algorithm MUB achieves an approximation guarantee, which is no worse than n−r1+(n−r−1)(1−κf ) , where r is the number of connected components of G.\nProof. This result follows directly from Corollary 5.1 and the fact that |X∗| = n− r.\nIn this case, Algorithm EA in fact provides slightly worse guarantees. Moreover the bound for MUB is optimal:\nTheorem 5.7. For the class of submodular functions with curvature κf < 1, no poly-time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor of n 1−3\n1+(n1−3 −1)(1−κf )+δκf for the SST problem for any , δ > 0.\nProof. In this case, we use the construction of [16], and define fRκ (X) = κf min{|X∩R̄|+min{|X∩R|, β}, α}+ (1− κf )|X|, and gκf (X) = κfmin{|X|, α}+ (1− κf )|X|, where α = n1+ , β = n3 (1 + δ) and |R| = α. For the formal graph construction, see [16]. Then with high probability R is connected in the graph [16]. Since fR and g are indistinguishable with high probability, so are f R κ and g κf . Then notice that the minimum value\nof fRκ and g κf are κfβ + (1− κf )n and n respectively, and it is clear that the ratio between them is better than n 1−3\n1+(n1−3 −1)(1−κf )+δκf . Hence if any algorithm performs better than this, it will be able to distinguish\nfR and g with high probability, which is a contradiction.\nAna analogous analysis applies to combinatorial constraints like Steiner trees [16]. Minimum submodular perfect matching (SPM): Here, we aim to find a perfect matching in a graph that minimizes a monotone submodular function. Corollary 5.1 implies that an MUB approximation will achieve an approximation factor of at most n2+(n−2)(1−κf ) . This bound is also tight:\nTheorem 5.8. Given a submodular function with a curvature κf > 0 and any > 0, no polynomial-time algorithm achieves an approximation factor better than n 1−3\n2+(n1−3 −2)(1−κf )+2δκf for the SPM problem.\nProof. We use the same submodular functions as the spanning tree case, and it can be shown [16] that with high probability the set R contains a perfect matching and the two functions are indistinguishable. Taking the ratio of gκf and f\nκf R , provides the above result.\nMinimum submodular edge cover: The minimum submodular edge cover involves finding an edge cover (subset of edges covering all vertices), with minimum submodular cost. This problem has been investigated in [25], and they show that this problem is O(n) hard. Algorithm MUB provides an approximation guarantee which is no worse than 2n2+(n−2)(1−κf ) . We can show a almost matching hardness lower bound for this problem.\nTheorem 5.9. Given a submodular function, with curvature coefficient κf and any , δ > 0, there cannot exist a polynomial-time approximation algorithm, which achieves an approximation better than n 1−3 2+(n1−3 −2)(1−κf )+2δκf for the minimum submodular edge cover problem.\nProof. We can use the construction of [25] to show this. However a simple observation shows that a perfect matching is also an edge cover, and hence the hardness of edge cover has to be at least as much as the hardness of perfect matchings."

      "text" : "We end this section by empirically demonstrating the performance of MUB and EA and their precise dependence on curvature. We focus on cardinality lower bound constraints, C = {X ⊆ V : |X| ≥ α} and the “worst-case” class of functions that has been used throughout this paper to prove lower bounds,\nfR(X) = min{|X ∩ R̄|+ β, |X|, α}, (40)\nwhere R̄ = V \\R and R ⊆ V is random set such that |R| = α. We adjust α = n1/2+ and β = n2 by a parameter . The smaller is, the harder the problem. The function (40) has curvature κf = 1. To obtain a function with specific curvature κ, we define\nfRκ (X) = κf(X) + (1− κ)|X|. (41)\nIn all our experiments, we take the average over 20 random draws of R. We first set κ = 1 and vary . Figure 1(a) shows the empirical approximation factors obtained using EA and MUB, and the theoretical bound. The empirical factors follow the theoretical results very closely. Empirically, we also see that the problem becomes harder as decreases. Next we fix = 0.1 and vary the curvature κ in fRκ . Figure 1(b) illustrates that the theoretical and empirical approximation factors improve significantly as κ decreases. Hence, much better approximations than the previous theoretical lower bounds are possible if κ is not too large. This observation can be very important in practice. Here, too, the empirical upper bounds follow the theoretical bounds very closely. Figures 1(c) and (d) show results for larger α and β = 1. In Figure 1(c), as α increases, the empirical factors improve. In particular, as predicted by the theoretical bounds, EA outperforms MUB for large α and, for α ≥ n2/3, EA finds the optimal solution. In addition, Figures 1(b) and (d) illustrate the theoretical and empirical effect of curvature: as n grows, the bounds saturate and approximate a constant 1/(1− κ) – they do not grow polynomially in n. Overall, we see that the empirical results quite closely follow our theoretical results, and that, as the theory suggests, curvature significantly affects the approximation factors."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion and Discussion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we study the effect of curvature on the problems of approximating, learning and minimizing submodular functions under constraints. We prove tightened, curvature-dependent upper bounds with almost matching lower bounds. These results complement known results for submodular maximization [7, 55]. Moreover, in [28], we also consider the role of curvature in submodular optimization problems over a class of submodular constraints. Given that the functional form and effect of the submodularity ratio proposed in [9] is similar to that of curvature, an interesting extension is the question of whether there is a single unifying quantity for both of these terms. Another open question is whether a quantity similar to curvature can be defined for subadditive functions, thus refining the results in [2, 1] for learning subadditive functions. Finally it also seems that the techniques in this paper could be used to provide improved curvature-dependent regret bounds for constrained online submodular minimization [34].

We show that the complexity of all three problems depends on the “curvature” of the submodular function, and provide lower and upper bounds that refine and improve previous results [3, 16, 18, 52]. Our proof techniques are fairly generic. We either use a black-box transformation of the function (for approximation and learning), or a transformation of algorithms to use an appropriate surrogate function (for minimization). Curiously, curvature has been known to influence approximations for submodular maximization [7, 55], but its effect on minimization, approximation and learning has hitherto been open. We complete this picture, and also support our theoretical claims by empirical results.",
