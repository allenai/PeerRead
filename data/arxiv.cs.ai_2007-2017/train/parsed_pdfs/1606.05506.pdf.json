      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Deep learning methods have gained interest from the machine learning and computer vision research community over the last years because these methods provide exceptional performance in classification tasks. Especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — first introduced in 1989 by LeCun et el. [9] — have become popular for object classification. CNNs were more widely used after the deep CNN from Krizhevsky et al. [8] outperformed the state of the art methods in ILSVRC12 [10] by a wide margin in 2012.\nConvolutional neural networks consist of multiple layers of nodes, also called neurons. One important layer type is the convolutional layer from which the networks obtain their name. In a convolutional layer the responses of the nodes depend on the convolution of a region of the input image with a kernel. Additional layers introduce non-linearities, rectification, pooling, etc. The goal of training a CNN lies in optimizing the network weights using image-label pairs to best reconstruct the correct label given an image. During testing the network is confronted with novel images and expected to generate the correct label. The network is trained by gradient descent. The gradient is calculated by backpropagation of labeling errors. The general idea of CNNs is to automatically learn the features needed to distinguish classes and generate increasingly abstract features as the information moves up the layers.\nSince CNNs are very popular at the moment and perceived — in parts of the computer vision community — as obtaining human like performance we wanted to test their applicability on visual tasks slightly outside the mainstream which are still trivially solvable by humans. We chose to learn simple abstract classes using a standard CNN not because we assume that they will perform better on the tasks than other, possibly much simpler methods, but because we want to gain insights into CNNs and how they perform on tasks which can be solved trivially by humans. We will mainly try to give insight into the amount of training images needed and how well the classifier generalizes to previously unseen shapes representing the same abstract concepts. Until now, most of the classes used for training and testing convolutional neural networks were concrete (e.g. detecting classes of objects, animal species in an image, . . . ). One notable exception is the work by Gülçehre et al.[6] who trained a CNN to recognize whether multiple presented shapes are the same. This is in essence a training on two abstract classes.\nThe problems presented by Bongard [1] inspired us to do the research presented in this paper. Foundalis [4] gives a good introduction to these problems and presents a system intended to solve them computationally. He used other methods than deep learning though. Previously, Fleuret et al.[3] compared human performance to classical machine learning methods (Adaboost on decision stumps and Support Vector Machines) on classification tasks. The classes used were similar in spirit to Bongard problems (e.g. object similarity, relative position, . . . ). Problems of similar nature are also\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n05 50\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n7 Ju\nn 20\n16\noften given at aptitude and intelligence tests to measure the ability for abstract, non-verbal reasoning.\nWe decided to use the two classes horizontal and vertical for our classification experiments since they are abstract, visually unambiguous, easy to differentiate by humans, and easily transfer to very different shapes. The goal is to learn a classifier that can distinguish between horizontally and vertically oriented structures and can transfer this knowledge to previously unseen objects and shapes. These are the first experiments exploring the representational capabilities of current deep learning systems regarding abstract classes."

      "heading" : "2. MATERIALS AND METHODS",
      "text" : "For this paper we used the convolutional neural network GoogLeNet as presented by Szegedy et al. [11]. It won in a number of categories in ILSVRC14. We slightly adapted the implementation provided with the Caffe [7] deep learning framework to our task (i.e. differentiating horizontal from vertical shapes).\nFor all experiments we started with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and use ADAGRAD [2] to adapt the learning rate over time. We trained the CNN for 1000 iterations. At this point the loss was so small (< 0.01) that no further meaningful improvement was possible. The CNN was trained 10 times on sets of different randomly generated images to judge the mean accuracy as well as the variance for different numbers of training images. All the graphs in this paper show the mean accuracy as blue dots and 90% of all measurements fall within the shaded area (see Figure 2 for an example). The test set contained 250 images per class. The reported accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified images of this test set."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3. EXPERIMENTS",
      "text" : "To test how well GoogLeNet can generalize abstract classes to different shapes or different renderings we use the following procedure: We train GoogLeNet without pre-training on a dataset consisting of the two classes “horizontal” and “vertical”. We then test the performance of the net on a test set containing the same two classes but represented by different shapes or rendered differently (e.g. outline of the shape versus a filled representation).\nWe are interested whether the CNN can distinguish the two classes and the amount of training images we need to obtain satisfactory results."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Learning on Rectangles, Testing on Ellipses",
      "text" : "We randomly generated vertically and horizontally oriented, filled rectangles on a white background for training the network. We tested on randomly generated, vertically or horizontally oriented, filled ellipses (Figure 1).\nFigure 2 shows the accuracy of the net after 1000 iterations in relation to the number of training images used per class. The CNN was able to learn and generalize the two classes more or less perfectly with about 100 training images per class. To our surprise, even 10 images per class result in a mean accuracy of about 90%.\nAs can be expected, the variance is higher for fewer training images. One has to assume that some images are better representations of the classes than others. Since the images are randomly generated the quality of the whole dataset will vary more for fewer images."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 Learning on Outline, Testing on Filled",
      "text" : "To test how sensitive the network is regarding different representations of the same shape we trained the network for the “horizontal” and “vertical” classes on outlines of rectangles (Figure 3). We used the filled rectangles from Figure 1 for testing.\nFigure 4 shows that the network has much bigger problems to generalize from outlines to filled versions of the same shape than it has at generalizing from one filled shape to another (i.e. from rectangle to ellipse). In addition, the vari-\nance does not decrease with the number of training images. This might indicate that the network is learning features that do not capture the abstract concept but specific information for outlines instead (i.e. overfitting to the training set).\nIf a CNN is able to learn abstract concepts one can reason that adding another shape outline to the training set will improve the accuracy. By this we force the net to learn a more abstract concept. To test this hypothesis we added horizontally and vertically oriented ellipse outlines to the training images and again tested the accuracy on the filled rectangles. As can we can see in Figure 5, the addition of ellipse outlines improved the performance on the filled rectangle test set slightly."

      "heading" : "3.3 Random Shapes",
      "text" : "We performed the last set of experiments on random shapes (Figure 6) which we created with an adapted version of the SVRT framework presented by Fleuret et al. [3].\nThe network is able to learn the two abstract classes with these highly varied shapes (Figure 7) and is also able to transfer the knowledge from outlines to filled shapes (Figure 9).\nFigure 10 shows that the network trained on random shape outlines even performs better at detecting the orientation of filled rectangles than the network trained on similar data sets (Figure 4 and Figure 5)\nAs a final experiment we looked at how well the random shapes generalize to other, textured random shapes. We used the likely most difficult test set where the texture orientation was orthogonal to the orientation of the shape. Figure 11 shows examples of this class. The results (Figure 12) indicate that more training examples lead to extreme variance in the results. The performance of the network varies from perfect accuracy to pure guessing. In addition, nothing during the training phase indicates how well the network will perform on the test set (e.g. lower loss during training is uncorrelated to the performance on the test set)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We showed that a state of the art convolutional neural network is able to learn abstract classes and transfer that information to other, previously unseen, shapes. But it is also apparent that the current networks are sensitive to the used training and testing data regarding how well the transfer of knowledge works.\nProbably the best example is the training on filled rectan-\ngles and testing on filled ellipses in comparison to training on rectangle outlines and testing on filled rectangles. It was unclear before doing experiments that GoogLeNet will perform much better on the first task than the second one. Humans are in general much less affected by such representational differences and perform well on highly variable data sets as can be seen in problem sets used for measuring non-verbal abstract reasoning or the Bongard problems.\nOf course humans as well as animals already have pre-training before encountering such tasks. Pre-training in the form of previously learned concepts as well as the optimization that occurred during evolution and manifests itself in the organization of the brain. A CNN is missing this information. We think therefore that pre-training of networks on the right data set will be paramount to increase the performance on more abstract tasks. The results of Gülçehre et al.[6] also\npoint into this direction."
