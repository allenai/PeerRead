      "text" : "It is well-known that exploiting label correlations is important to multi-label learning. Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the full-label and the missinglabel cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds. The extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data. Key words: Global and local label correlation, label manifold, missing labels, multi-label learning."

Thus, multi-label learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years [24].\nCurrent studies on multi-label learning try to incorporate label correlations of different orders [24]. However, existing approaches mostly focus on global label correlations shared by all instances [7, 10, 15]. For example, labels “fish” and “ocean” are highly correlated, and so are “stock” and “finance”. On the other hand, certain label correlations are only shared by a local data subset [9]. For example, “apple” is related to “fruit” in gourmet magazines, but is related to “digital devices” in technology magazines. Previous studies focus on exploiting either global or local label correlations. However, considering both of them is obviously more beneficial and desirable.\nAnother problem with label correlations is that they are usually difficult to specify manually. As label correlations may vary in different contexts and there is no unified measure for specifying appropriate correlations, they are usually estimated from the observed data. Some approaches learn the label hierarchies by hierarchical clustering [14] or Bayesian network structure learning [23]. However, the hierarchical structure may not exist in some applications. For example, labels such as “desert”, “mountains”, “sea”, “sunset” and “trees” do not have any natural hierarchical correlations, and label hierarchies may not be useful. Others estimate label correlations by the co-occurrence of labels in training data [13]. However, it may cause overfitting. Moreover, co-occurrence is less meaningful for labels with very few positive instances.\nIn multi-label learning, some labels may be missing from the training set. For example, human labelers may ignore object classes they do not know or of little interest. Recently, multi-label learning with missing labels has become a hot topic. Xu et al. [21] and Yu et al. [22] considered using the low-rank structure on the instance-label mapping. A more direct approach to model the label dependency approximates the label matrix as a product of two low-rank matrices [8]. This leads to simpler recovery of the missing labels, and produces a latent representation of the label matrix.\nIn the missing label cases, estimation of label correlation becomes even more difficult, as the observed label distribution is different from the true one. As a result, the aforementioned methods (based on hierarchical clustering and co-occurrence, for example) will produce biased estimates of label correlations.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach called “Multi-Label Learning with GLObal and loCAL Correlation” (GLOCAL), which simultaneously recovers the missing labels, trains the linear classifiers and exploits both global and local label correlations. It learns a latent label representation. Classifier outputs are encouraged to be similar on highly positively correlated labels, and dissimilar on highly negatively correlated labels. We do not assume the presence of external knowledge sources specifying the label correlations. Instead, these correlations are learned simultaneously with the latent label representations and instance-label mapping.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, related works of multi-label learning with label correlations are introduced. In Section 3, the problem formulation and the GLOCAL approach are proposed. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the work.\nNotations For a matrix A, A> denotes its transpose, tr(A) is its trace, ‖A‖F is its Frobenius norm, and diag(A) returns a vector containing the diagonal elements of A.

      "text" : "Multi-label learning has been widely studied in recent years. Based on the degree of label correlations used, it can be divided into three categories [24]: (i) first-order; (ii) second-order; and (iii) high-order. For the first-order strategy, label correlations are not considered, and the multi-label problem is transformed into multiple independent binary classification problems. For example, BR [3] trains a classifier for each label independently. For the second-order strategy, pairwise label relations are considered. For example, CLR [7] transforms the multi-label learning problem into the pairwise label ranking problem. For the high-order strategy, all other labels’ influences imposed on each label are taken into account. For example, CC [15] transforms the multi-label learning problem into a chain of binary classification problems, with the ground-truth labels encoded into the features.\nMost previous studies focus on global label correlations. However, MLLOC [9] demonstrates that sometimes label correlations may only be shared by a local data subset. Specifically, it enhances\nthe feature representation of each instance by embedding a code into the feature space, which encodes the influence of labels of an instance to the local label correlations. This has some limitations. First, when the dimensionality of the feature space is large, the code is less discriminative and will be dominated by the original features. Second, MLLOC considers only the local label correlations, but not the global ones. Third, MLLOC cannot learn with missing labels.\nIn some real-world applications, labels are partially observed, and multi-label learning with missing labels has attracted much attention. MAXIDE [21] is based on fast low-rank matrix completion, and has strong theoretical guarantees. However, it only works in the transductive setting. Moreover, a label correlation matrix has to be specified manually. LEML [22] also relies on a low-rank structure, and works in an inductive setting. However, it only implicitly uses global label correlations. ML-LRC [20] adopts a low-rank structure to capture global label correlations, and addresses the missing labels by introducing a supplementary label matrix. However, only global label correlations are taken into account. Obviously, it would be more desirable to learn both global and local label correlations simultaneously.\nManifold regularization [1] exploits instance similarity by forcing the predicted values on similar instances to be similar. A similar idea can be adapted to the label manifold, and so predicted values for correlated labels should be similar. However, the Laplacian matrix is based on some label similarity or correlation matrix, which can be hard to specify as discussed in Section 1."

We denote the feature vector of an instance by x ∈ X ⊆ Rd, and denote the ground-truth label vector by ỹ ∈ Y ⊆ {−1, 1}l, where [ỹ]j = 1 if x is with class label cj , and −1 otherwise. As mentioned in Section 1, instances in the training data may be partially labeled, i.e., some labels may be missing. We adopt the general setting that both positive and negative labels can be missing [8, 21, 22]. The observed label vector is denoted y, where [y]j = 0 if class label cj is not labeled (i.e. it is missing), and [y]j = [ỹ]j otherwise. Given the training data D = {(xi,yi)}ni=1, our goal is to learn a mapping function Ψ : X → Y.\nIn this paper, we propose the GLOCAL algorithm, which learns and exploits both global and local label correlations via label manifolds. To recover the missing labels, learning of the latent label representation and classifier training are performed simultaneously."

Let its rank be k < l. Thus, Ỹ can be written as the low-rank decomposition UV , where U ∈ Rl×k and V ∈ Rk×n. Intuitively, V represents the latent labels that are more compact and more semantically abstract than the original labels, while matrix U projects the original labels to the latent label space.\nIn general, the labels are only partially observed. Let the observed label matrix be Y = [y1, . . . ,yn] ∈ {−1, 0, 1}l×n, and Ω be the set containing indices of the observed labels in Y (i.e., indices of the nonzero elements in Y ). We focus on minimizing the reconstruction error on the observed labels, i.e., ‖ΠΩ(Y −UV )‖2F , where [ΠΩ(A)]ij = Aij if (i, j) ∈ Ω, and 0 otherwise. Moreover, we use a linear mapping W ∈ Rd×k to map instances to the latent labels. This W is learned by minimizing ‖V −W>X‖2F , where X = [x1, . . . ,xn] ∈ Rd×n is the instance matrix. Combining these two, we obtain the following optimization problem:\nmin U,V,W\n‖ΠΩ(Y −UV )‖2F + λ‖V −W>X‖2F + λ2R(U,V,W ), (1)\nwhere R(U,V,W ) is a regularizer and λ, λ2 are tradeoff parameters.

Let f = [f1, · · · , fl]>, thus fj(x) denotes the predictive value on j-th label for x. We concatenate all f(x), ∀x ∈ X, denoted by F0, thus F0 = [f(x1), · · · ,f(xn)] = UW>X."

      "text" : "Exploiting label correlations is an essential ingredient in multi-label learning. Here, we use label correlations to regularize the model. Intuitively, the more positively correlated two labels are, the closer are the corresponding classifier outputs, and vice versa. Let S0 = [Sij ] ∈ Rl×l be the\nglobal label correlation matrix. The manifold regularizer ∑\ni,j Sij‖fi,:−fj,:‖22 should have a small\nvalue [12]. Here, fi,:, the ith row of F0, is the vector of classifier outputs for the ith label on the n samples. Let D0 be the diagonal matrix with diagonal S01, where 1 is the vector of ones. The manifold regularizer can be equivalently written as tr(F>0 L0F0) [11], where L0 = D0−S0 is the Laplacian matrix of S0.\nAs discussed in Section 1, label correlations may vary from one local region to another. Assume that the data X is partitioned into g groups {X1, . . . ,Xg}, where Xm ∈ Rd×nm has size nm. This partitioning can be obtained by domain knowledge (e.g., gene pathways [16] and networks [4] in bioinformatics applications) or clustering. Let Ym be the label submatrix in Y corresponding to Xm, and Sm ∈ Rl×l be the local label correlation matrix of group m. Similar to global label correlation, to encourage the classifier outputs to be similar on the positively correlated labels and dissimilar on the negatively correlated ones, we minimize tr(F>mLmFm), where Lm is the Laplacian matrix of Sm and Fm = UW >Xm is the classifier output matrix for group m.\nCombining global and local label correlations with Eqn. (1), we have the following optimization problem:\nmin U,V,W\n‖ΠΩ(Y−UV )‖2F+λ‖V−W>X‖2F +λ2R(U ,V ,W )+λ3tr(F>0 L0F0)+ g∑\nm=1\nλ4tr(F > mLmFm),\n(2)\nwhere λ, λ2, λ3, λ4 are tradeoff parameters.\nIntuitively, a large local group contributes more to the global label correlations. In particular, the following Lemma shows that when the cosine similarity is used to compute Sij , we have\nS0 = ∑g m=1 nm n Sm.\nLemma 1 Let [S0]ij = yi,:y\n> j,:\n‖yi,:‖‖yj,:‖ and [Sm]ij = ym,i,:y\n> m,j,:\n‖ym,i,:‖‖ym,j,:‖ , where yi,: is the ith row of Y , and ym,i,: is the ith row of Ym. Then, S0 = ∑g m=1 nm n Sm.\nIn general, when the global label correlation matrix is a linear combination of the local label correlation matrices, the following Proposition shows that the global label Laplacian matrix is also a linear combination of the local label Laplacian matrices with the same combination coefficients.\nProposition 1 If S0 = ∑g m=1 βmSm, then L0 = ∑g m=1 βmLm.\nUsing Lemma 1 and Proposition 1, Eqn. (2) can then be rewritten as follows:\nmin U,V,W\n‖ΠΩ(Y −UV )‖2F +λ‖V −W>X‖2F +λ2R(U,V,W )\n+ g∑ m=1 ( λ3nm n tr(F>0 LmF0) + λ4tr(F > mLmFm) ) . (3)\nThe success of label manifold regularization hinges on a good correlation matrix (or equivalently, a good Laplacian matrix). In multi-label learning, one rudimentary approach is to compute the correlation coefficient between two labels by cosine distance [19]. However, this can be noisy since some labels may only have very few positive instances in the training data. When labels can be missing, this computation may even become misleading, since the label distribution of observed labels may be much different from that of the ground-truth label distribution due to the missing labels.\nIn this paper, instead of specifying any correlation metric or label correlation matrix, we learn the Laplacian matrices directly. Note that the Laplacian matrices are symmetric positive definite. Thus, for m ∈ {1, . . . , g}, we decompose Lm as ZmZ>m, where Zm∈Rl×k. For simplicity, k is set to the dimensionality of the latent representation V . As a result, learning the Laplacian matrices is transformed to learning Z ≡ {Z1, . . . ,Zg}. Note that optimization w.r.t. Zm may lead to the trivial solution Zm = 0. To avoid this problem, we add the constraint that the diagonal entries in ZmZ > m are 1, for m ∈ {1, · · · , g}. This constraint also enables us to obtain a normalized Laplacian matrix [5] of Lm.\nLet J = [Jij ] be the indicator matrix with Jij = 1 if (i, j) ∈ Ω, and 0 otherwise. ΠΩ(Y −UV ) can be rewritten as the Hadamard product J ◦ (Y − UV ). Combining the decomposition of Laplacian matrices and the diagonal constraints of Zm, we obtain the optimization problem as:\nmin U,V,W,Z\n‖J ◦(Y −UV )‖2F +λ‖V −W>X‖2F +λ2R(U,V,W )\n+ g∑ m=1 (λ3nm n tr ( F>0 ZmZ > mF0 ) +λ4tr(F > mZmZ > mFm) ) s.t. diag(ZmZ > m) = 1,m ∈ {1, 2, . . . , g}.

MLLOC only considers local label correlations and LEML only makes use of the low-rank structure. Though ML-LRC takes advantage of both the low-rank structure and label correlations, only global label correlations are considered. As a result, GLOCAL is the best overall, as it models both global and local label correlations.\nTo show the example correlations learned by GLOCAL, we use two local groups extracted from the Image dataset. Figure 1 shows that local label correlation does vary from group to group, and is different from global correlation. For group 1, “sunset” is highly correlated with “desert” and “sea” (Figure 1(c)). This can also be seen from the images in Figure 1(a). Moreover,\n“trees” sometimes co-occurs with “deserts” (first and last images in Figure 1(a)). However, in group 2 (Figure 1(d)), “mountain” and “sea” often occur together and “trees” occurs less often with “desert” (Figure 1(b)). Figure 1(e) shows the learned global label correlation: “sea” and “sunset”, “mountain” and “trees” are positively correlated, whereas “desert” and “sea”, “desert” and “trees” are negatively correlated. All these correlations are consistent with intuition.\nTo further validate the effectiveness of global and local label correlations, we study two degenerate versions of GLOCAL: (i) GLObal, which uses only global label correlations; and (ii) loCAL, which\nuses only local label correlations. Note that the local groups obtained by clustering are not of equal sizes. For some datasets, the largest cluster contains more than 40% of instances, while some small ones contain fewer than 5% each. Global correlation is then dominated by the local correlation matrix of the largest cluster (Proposition 1), making the performance difference on the whole test set obscure. Hence, we focus on the performance of the small clusters. As can be seen from Table 3, using only global or local correlation may be good enough on some data sets (such as Health).

      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed a new multi-label correlation learning approach GLOCAL, which simultaneously recovers the missing labels, trains the classifier and exploits both global and local label correlations, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing the label manifolds. Compared with the previous work, it is the first to exploit both global and local label correlations, which directly learns the Laplacian matrix without requiring any other prior knowledge\non label correlations. As a result, the classifier outputs and label correlations best match each other, both globally and locally. Moreover, GLOCAL provides a unified solution for both full-label and missing-label multi-label learning. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label learning approaches on learning with both full labels and missing labels. In our work, we handle the case that label correlations are symmetric. In many situations, correlations can be asymmetric. For example, “mountain” are highly correlated to “tree”, since it is very common that a mountain has trees in it. However, “tree” may be less correlated to “mountain”, because trees can be found not only in mountains, but often in the streets, parks, etc. So it is desirable to study the asymmetric label correlations in our future work."

Existing approaches either assume that the label correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances. Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is, it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the full-label and the missinglabel cases, exploiting global and local label correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and optimizing label manifolds. The extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data.",
