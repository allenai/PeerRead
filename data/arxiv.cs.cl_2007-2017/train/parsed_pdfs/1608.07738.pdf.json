      "text" : "Word similarity is one of the most important and most studied problems in Natural Language Processing (NLP), as it is fundamental for a wide range of tasks, such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), Information Extraction (IE), Paraphrase Generation (PG), as well as the automatic creation of semantic resources. Most of the current approaches to word similarity estimation rely on some version of the Distributional Hypothesis (DH), which claims that words occurring in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957; Sahlgren, 2008). Such hypothesis provides the theoretical ground for Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs), which represent word meaning by means of high-dimensional vectors encoding corpus-extracted co-occurrences between targets and their linguistic contexts (Turney and Pantel, 2010). Traditional DSMs initialize vectors with cooccurrence frequencies. Statistical measures, such as Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI) or its variants (Church and Hanks, 1990; Bullinaria and Levy, 2012; Levy et al., 2015), have been adopted to normalize these values. Also, these models have exploited the power of dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD; Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and Random Indexing (Sahlgren, 2005). These first-generation models are currently referred to as count-based, as distinguished from the contextpredicting ones, which have been recently proposed in the literature (Bengio et al., 2006; Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013). More commonly known as word embeddings, these secondgeneration models learn meaning representations through neural network training: the vectors dimensions are set to maximize the probability for the contexts that typically occur with the target word. Vector Cosine is generally adopted by both types of models as a similarity measure. However, this metric has been found to suffer from several problems (Li and Han, 2013; Faruqui et al., 2016), such as a bias towards features with higher values and the inability of considering how many features are actually shared by the vectors. Finally, Cosine is affected by the hubness effect (Dinu et al., 2014; Schnar X iv :1 60 8. 07 73 8v 2 [ cs .C L ] 5 O ct\n2 01\nabel et al., 2015), i.e. the fact that words with high frequency tend to be universal neighbours. Even though other measures have been proposed in the literature (Deza and Deza, 2009), Vector Cosine is still by far the most popular one (Turney and Pantel, 2010). However, in a recent paper of Santus et al. (2016b), the authors have claimed that Vector Cosine is outperformed by APSyn (Average Precision for Synonymy), a metric based on the extent of the intersection between the most salient contexts of two target words. The measure, tested on a window-based DSM, outperformed Vector Cosine on the ESL and on the TOEFL datasets. In the present work, we perform a systematic evaluation of APSyn, testing it on the most popular test sets for similarity estimation - namely WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), MEN (Bruni et al., 2014) and SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015). For comparison, Vector Cosine is also calculated on several countbased DSMs. We implement a total of twenty-eight models with different parameters settings, each of which differs according to corpus size, context window width, weighting scheme and SVD application. The new metric is shown to outperform Vector Cosine in most settings, except when the latter metric is applied on a PPMI-SVD reduced matrix (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012), against which APSyn still obtains competitive performances. The results are also discussed in relation to the state-of-the-art DSMs, as reported in Hill et al. (2015). In such comparison, the best settings of our models outperform the word embeddings in almost all datasets. A pilot study was also carried out to investigate whether APSyn is scalable. Results prove its high performance also when calculated on large corpora, such as those used by Baroni et al. (2014). On top of the performance, APSyn seems not to be subject to some of the biases that affect Vector Cosine. Finally, considering the debate about the ability of DSMs to calculate genuine similarity as opposed to word relatedness (Turney, 2001; Agirre et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2015), we test the ability of the models to quantify genuine semantic similarity."

      "text" : "Count-based DSMs are built in an unsupervised way. Starting from large preprocessed corpora, a matrix M(m×n) is built, in which each row is a vector representing a target word in a vocabulary of size m, and each column is one of the n potential contexts (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Levy et al., 2015). The vector dimensions are counters recording how many times the contexts co-occur with the target words. Since raw frequency is highly skewed, most DSMs have adopted more sophisticated association measures, such as Positive PMI (PPMI; Church and Hanks, 1990; Bullinaria and Levy, 2012; Levy et al., 2015) and Local Mutual Information (LMI; Evert, 2005). PPMI compares the observed joint probability of co-occurrence of w and c with their probability of co-occurrence assuming statistical indipendence. It is defined as: PPMI(w, c) = max(PMI(w, c), 0) (1) PMI(w, c) = log ( P (w, c) P (w)P (c) ) = log ( |w, c|D |w||c| ) (2)\nwhere w is the target word, c is the given context, P(w,c) is the probability of co-occurrence, and D is the collection of observed word-context pairs. Unlike frequency, PPMI was found to have a bias towards rare events. LMI could therefore be used to reduce such bias and it consists in multiplying the PPMI of the pair by its co-occurrence frequency. Since target words may occur in hundreds of thousands contexts, most of which are not informative, methods for dimensionality reduction have been investigated, such as truncated SVD (Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Turney and Pantel, 2010; Levy et al., 2015). SVD has been regarded as a method for noise reduction and for the discovery of latent dimensions of meaning, and it has been shown to improve similarity measurements when combined with PPMI (Bullinaria and Levy, 2012; Levy et al., 2015). As we will see in the next section, APSyn applies another type of reduction, which consists in selecting only the top-ranked\ncontexts in a relevance sorted context list for each word vector. Such reduction complies with the principle of cognitive economy (i.e. only the most relevant contexts are elaborated; see Finton, 2002) and with the results of behavioural studies, which supported feature saliency (Smith et al., 1974). Since APSyn was defined for linguistic contexts (Santus et al., 2016b), we did not test it on SVD-reduced spaces, leaving such test to further studies."

      "heading" : "2.2 Similarity Measures",
      "text" : "Vector Cosine, by far the most common distributional similarity metric (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2004; Mikolov et al., 2013; Levy et al., 2015), looks at the normalized correlation between the dimensions of two word vectors, w1 and w2 and returns a score between -1 and 1. It is described by the following equation:\ncos(w1, w2) = ∑n i=1 f1i× f2i√∑n\ni=1 f1i× √∑n i=1 f2i (3)\nwhere fix is the i-th dimension in the vector x. Despite its extensive usage, Vector Cosine has been recently criticized for its hyper sensibility to features with high values and for the inability of identifying the actual feature intersection (Li and Han, 2013; Schnabel et al., 2015). Recalling an example by Li and Han (2013), the Vector Cosine for the toy-vectors a = [1, 2, 0] and b = [0, 1, 0] (i.e. 0.8944) is unexpectedly higher than the one for a and c = [2, 1, 0] (i.e. 0.8000), and even higher than the one for the toy-vectors a and d = [1, 2, 1] (i.e. 0.6325), which instead share a larger feature intersection. Since the Vector Cosine is a distance measure, it is also subject to the hubness problem, which was shown by Radovanovic et al. (2010) to be an inherent property of data distributions in highdimensional vector space. The problem consists in the fact that vectors with high frequency tend to get high scores with a large number of other vectors, thus becoming universal nearest neighbours (Dinu et al., 2014; Schnabel et al., 2015; Faruqui et al., 2016). Another measure of word similarity named APSyn 1\n1Scripts and information can be found at https://github.com/esantus/APSyn\nhas been recently introduced in Santus et al. (2016a) and Santus et al. (2016b), and it was shown to outperform the vector cosine on the TOEFL (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) and on the ESL (Turney, 2001) test sets. This measure is based on the hypothesis that words carrying similar meanings share their most relevant contexts in higher proportion compared to less similar words. The authors define APSyn as the extent of the weighted intersection between the top most salient contexts of the target words, weighting it by the average rank of the intersected features in the PPMI-sorted contexts lists of the target words:\nAPSyn(w1, w2) =\n∑ f N(F1)∩N(F2)\n1\n(rank1(f) + rank2(f))/2\n(4)\nmeaning: for every feature f included in the intersection between the top N features of w1 and the top of w2 (i.e. N(f1) and N(f2)), add 1 divided by the average rank of the feature in the PPMI-ranked features of w1 (i.e. rank1) and w2 (i.e. rank2). According to the authors, N is a parameter, generally ranging between 100 and 1000. Results are shown to be relatively stable when N varies in this range, while become worst if bigger N are used, as low informative features are also introduced. Santus et al. (2016a) have also used LMI instead of PPMI as weighting function, but achieving lower results. With respect to the limitations mentioned above for the Vector Cosine, APSyn has some advantages. First of all, it is by definition able to identify the extent of the intersection. Second, its sensibility to features with high values can be kept under control by tuning the value of N. On top of it, feature values (i.e. their weights) do not affect directly the similarity score, as they are only used to build the feature rank. With reference to the toy-vectors presented above, APSyn would assign in fact completely different scores. The higher score would be assigned to a and d, as they share two relevant features out of three. The second higher score would be assigned to a and c, for the same reason as above. The lower score would be instead assigned to a and b, as they only share one non-salient feature. In section 3.4, we briefly discuss the hubness problem."

      "heading" : "2.3 Datasets",
      "text" : "For our evaluation, we used three widely popular datasets: WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), MEN (Bruni et al., 2014), SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2015). These datasets have a different history, but all of them consist in word pairs with an associated score, that should either represent word association or word similarity. WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) was proposed as a word similarity dataset containing 353 pairs annotated with scores between 0 and 10. However, Hill et al. (2015) claimed that the instructions to the annotators were ambiguous with respect to similarity and association, so that the subjects assigned high similarity scores to entities that are only related by virtue of frequent association (e.g. coffee and cup; movie and theater). On top of it, WordSim-353 does not provide the POS-tags for the 439 words that it contains, forcing the users to decide which POS to assign to the ambiguous words (e.g. [white, rabbit] and [run, marathon]). An extension of this dataset resulted from the subclassification carried out by Agirre et al. (2009), which discriminated between similar and associated word pairs. Such discrimination was done by asking annotators to classify all pairs according to the semantic relation they hold (i.e. identical, synonymy, antonymy, hypernymy, meronymy and none-of-the-above). The annotation was then used to group the pairs in three categories: similar pairs (those classified as identical, synonyms, antonyms and hypernyms), associated pairs (those classified as meronyms and none-of-the-above, with an average similarity greater than 5), and non-associated pairs (those classified as none-of-the-above, with an average similarity below or equal to 5). Two gold standard were finally produced: i) one for similarity, containing 203 word pairs resulting from the union of similar and non-associated pairs; ii) one for relatedness, containing 252 word pairs resulting from the union of associated and non-associated pairs. Even though such a classification made a clear distinction between the two types of relations (i.e. similarity and association), Hill et al. (2015) argue that these gold standards still carry the scores they had in WordSim-353, which are known to be ambiguous in this regard. The MEN Test Collection (Bruni et al., 2014) includes 3,000 word pairs divided in two sets (one for training and one for testing) together with human judgments, obtained through Amazon Mechanical Turk. The construction was performed by asking subjects to rate which pair - among two of them - was the more related one (i.e. the most associated). Every pairs-couple was proposed only once, and a final score out of 50 was attributed to each pair, according to how many times it was rated as the most related. According to Hill et al. (2015), the major weakness of this dataset is that it does not encode word similarity, but a more general notion of association. SimLex-999 is the dataset introduced by Hill et al. (2015) to address the above mentioned criticisms of confusion between similarity and association. The dataset consists of 999 pairs containing 1,028 words, which were also evaluated in terms of POS-tags and concreteness. The pairs were annotated with a score between 0 and 10, and the instructions were strictly requiring the identification of word similarity, rather than word association. Hill et al. (2015) claim that differently from other datasets, SimLex-999 interannotator agreement has not been surpassed by any automatic approach."

As for SVD factorization, we found out that the best results were always achieved when the number of latent dimensions was between 300 and 500. We report here only the scores for k = 300, since 300 is one of the most common choices for the dimensionality of SVD-reduced spaces and it is always close to be an optimal value for the parameter. Fourteen out of twenty-eight models were developed for RCV1, while the others were developed for Wikipedia.

      "text" : "Table 1 shows the Spearman correlation scores for Vector Cosine and APSyn on the three datasets for the eight most representative DSMs built using RCV Vol. 1. Table 2 does the same for the DSMs built using Wikipedia. For the sake of comparison, we also report the results of the state-of-the-art DSMs mentioned in Hill et al. (2015) (see Section 2.5). With a glance at the tables, it can be easily noticed that the measures perform particularly well in two models: i) APSyn, when applied on the PPMI-weighted DSM (henceforth, APSynPPMI); ii) Vector Cosine, when applied on the SVD-reduced PPMI-weighted matrix (henceforth, CosSVDPPMI). These two models perform consistently and in a comparable way across the datasets, generally outperforming the state-of-the-art DSMs, with an exception for the Wikipedia-trained models in WordSim-353. Some further observations are: i) corpus size strongly affects the results; ii) PPMI strongly outperforms LMI for both Vector Cosine and APSyn; iii) SVD boosts the Vector Cosine, especially when it is combined with PPMI; iv) N has some impact on the performance of APSyn, which generally achieves the best results for N=500. As a note about iii), the results of using SVD jointly with LMI spaces are less predictable than when combining it with PPMI. Also, we can notice that the smaller window (i.e. 2) does not always perform better than the larger one (i.e. 3). The former appears to perform better on SimLex-999, while the latter seems to have some advantages on the other datasets. This\nmight depend on the different type of similarity encoded in SimLex-999 (i.e. genuine similarity). On top of it, despite Hill et al. (2015)’s claim that no evidence supports the hypothesis that smaller context windows improve the ability of models to capture similarity (Agirre et al., 2009; Kiela and Clark, 2014), we need to mention that window 5 was abandoned because of its low performance. With reference to the hubness effect, we have conducted a pilot study inspired to the one carried out by Schnabel et al. (2015), using the words of the SimLex-999 dataset as query words and collecting for each of them the top 1000 nearest neighbors. Given all the neighbors at rank r, we have checked their rank in the frequency list extracted from our corpora. Figure 1 shows the relation between the rank in the nearest neighbor list and the rank in the frequency list. It can be easily noticed that the highest ranked nearest neighbors tend to have higher rank also in the frequency list, supporting the idea that frequent words are more likely to be nearest neighbors. APSyn does not seem to be able to overcome such bias, which seems to be in fact an inherent property of the DSMs (Radovanovic et al., 2010). Further investigation is needed to see whether variations of APSyn can tackle this problem.\nFinally, few words need to be spent with regard to the ability of calculating genuine similarity, as distinguished from word relatedness (Turney, 2001; Agirre et al., 2009; Hill et al., 2015). Table 3 and Table 4 show the Spearman correlation scores for the two measures calculated on the models respectively trained on RCV1 and Wikipedia, tested on the subsets of WordSim-353 extracted by Agirre et al. (2009). It can be easily noticed that our best models work better on the similarity subset. In particular, APSynPPMI performs about 20-30% better for the similarity subset than for the relatedness one (see Table 3), as well as both APSynPPMI and CosSVDPPMI do in Wikipedia (see Table 4)."

In such setting, we obtain a Spearman correlation of 0.72 on WordSim and 0.77 on MEN. These results are much higher than those reported by Baroni et al. (2014) for the count-based models (i.e. 0.62 on WordSim and 0.72 on MEN) and slightly lower than those reported for the predicting ones (i.e. 0.75 on WordSim and 0.80 on MEN)."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have presented the first systematic evaluation of APSyn, comparing it to Vector Cosine in the task of word similarity identification. We developed twenty-eight count-based DSMs, each of which implementing different hyperparameters. PPMI emerged as the most efficient association measure: it works particularly well with Vector Cosine, when combined with SVD, and it boosts APSyn. APSyn showed extremely promising results, despite its conceptual simplicity. It outperforms the Vector Cosine in almost all settings, except when the latter is used on a PPMI-weighed SVD-reduced DSM. Even in this case, anyway, its performance is very competitive. Interestingly, our best models achieve results that are comparable to - or even better than - those reported by Hill et al. (2015) for the stateof-the-art word embeddings models. In Section 3.5 we show that APSyn is scalable, outperforming the state-of-the-art count-based models reported in Baroni et al. (2014). On top of it, APSyn does not suffer from some of the problems reported for the Vector Cosine, such as the inability of identifying the number of shared features. It still however seems to be affected by the hubness issue, and more research should be carried out to tackle it. Concerning the discrimination between similarity and association, the good performance of APSyn on SimLex-999 (which was built with a specific attention to genuine similarity) and the large difference in performance between the two subsets of WordSim-353 described in Table 3 and Table 4 make us conclude that APSyn is indeed efficient in quantifying genuine similarity. To conclude, being a linguistically and cognitively grounded metric, APSyn offers the possibility for further improvements, by simply combining it to other properties that were not yet considered in its definition. A natural extension would be to verify whether APSyn hypothesis and implementation holds on SVD reduced matrices and word embeddings."

We evaluated this metric in a similarity estimation task on several popular test sets, and our results show that APSyn is in fact highly competitive, even with respect to the results reported in the literature for word embeddings. On top of it, APSyn addresses some of the weaknesses of Vector Cosine, performing well also on genuine similarity estimation.",
