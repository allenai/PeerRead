      "text" : "The skip-thought model has been proven to be effective at learning sentence representations and capturing sentence semantics. In this paper, we propose a suite of techniques to trim and improve it. First, we validate a hypothesis that, given a current sentence, inferring the previous and inferring the next sentence provide similar supervision power, therefore only one decoder for predicting the next sentence is preserved in our trimmed skip-thought model. Second, we present a connection layer between encoder and decoder to help the model to generalize better on semantic relatedness tasks. Third, we found that a good word embedding initialization is also essential for learning better sentence representations. We train our model unsupervised on a large corpus with contiguous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 supervised tasks, which includes semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and text classification benchmarks. We empirically show that, our proposed model is a faster, lighter-weight and equally powerful alternative to the original skip-thought model."

      "text" : "Learning distributed sentence representations is an important and hard topic in both the deep learning and natural language processing communities, since it requires machines to encode a sentence with potential unlimited language content into a fixed-dimension vector filled with continuous values. We are interested in learning to build a distributed sentence encoder in an unsupervised fashion by exploring the structure and relationship in a large unlabelled corpus. Since humans understand sentences by composing from the meanings of the words, we define that learning a sentence encoder should be composed of two essential components, which are learning distributed word representations, and learning how to compose a sentence representation from the representations of words in the given sentence.\nWith the development of deep learning techniques, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [1, 2, 3] have shown encouraging results on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and become the dominant methods in processing sequential data. [4] proposed LSTM-based sequence to sequence learning (seq2seq) model for machine translation. Later [5] applied the seq2seq model for unsupervised representation learning on language, and then finetuned the model for supervised tasks. The seq2seq model can be jointly trained to learn the word representation and the composition function on word representations, also it shows encouraging idea that knowledge learned from unsupervised training could be transferred to help other related supervised tasks.\n[6] proposed the skip-thought model, which is an encoder-decoder model for unsupervised distributed sentence representation learning. The paper exploits the semantic similarity within a tuple of adjacent sentences as a supervision, and successfully built a generic, distributed sentence encoder. Rather than applying the conventional autoencoder model, the skip-thought model tries to reconstruct the surrounding 2 sentences instead of itself. The learned sentence representation encoder outperforms\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 14\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\nprevious unsupervised pretrained models on the evaluation tasks with no finetuning, and the results are comparable to the models which were trained directly on the datasets in a supervised fashion.\nIn this paper, We aim to trim and improve the original skip-thought model by three techniques. First, given the neighborhood hypothesis first proposed in [7], we directly abandon one of the decoders in the skip-thought model, and leave only one encoder and one decoder for learning from inferring the next sentence given the current one. Second, we replace the plain connection used between the encoder and decoder with the Average+Max Connection, which is a non-linear non-parametric feature engineering method proposed by [8] for Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) [9] challenge, and enhances the model to capture more complex interactions among the hidden states. Third, a good initialization for word embeddings boosts the transferability of the model trained in unsupervised fashion, which may raise the importance of the word embeddings in unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, we show that increasing the dimension of the encoder improves the performance of our proposed model, but still keeps the number of parameters much smaller than the original skip-thought model. Detailed description of our model is described in Section 2."

      "text" : "In skip-thought model, given a sentence tuple (si−1, si, si+1), the encoder computes a fixeddimension vector as the representation zi for the sentence si, which learns a distribution p(zi|si; θe), where θe refers to the set of parameters in the encoder. Then, conditioned on the representation zi, two separated decoders are applied to reconstruct the previous sentence si−1, and the next sentence si+1, respectively. We call them previous decoder p(si−1|zi; θp) and next decoder p(si+1|zi; θn), where θ· denotes the set of parameters in each decoder. An illustration is shown in Figure 1a.\nSince the two conditional distributions learned from the decoders are parameterized independently, they implicitly utilize the sentence order information within the sentence tuple. Intuitively, given the current sentence si, inferring the previous sentence si−1 is considered to be different from inferring the next sentence si+1.\nEncoder: The encoder is a recurrent neural network, which is composed of bi-directional gated recurrent unit (GRU) [10], or uni-directional GRU. Suppose sentence si contains N words, which are w1i , w 2 i , ..., w N i . At an arbitrary time step t, the encoder produces a hidden state h t i, and we regard it as the representation for the previous subsequence through time t. At time N , the hidden state hNi represents the given sentence si, which is zi.\nDecoder: The decoder is a single-layer recurrent network with conditional GRU. Specifically, compared to GRU, it takes the sentence representation zi as an additional input at each time step. The decoder needs to reconstruct the previous sentence si−1 and the next sentence si+1 given the representation zi. The computation flows for the GRU and the conditional GRU are presented in Table 1."

      "heading" : "2.2 Trimming Skip-thought Model by Neighborhood Hypothesis",
      "text" : "The neighborhood hypothesis was first introduced in [7], and it pointed out that given the current sentence, inferring the previous sentence and inferring the next sentence both provide same supervision power.\nTo incorporate the neighborhood hypothesis into the model, we need to modify the skip-thought model. Given si, we assume that inferring si−1 is the same as inferring si+1. If we define si−1, si+1 are two neighbors of si, then the inferring process can be denoted as sj ∼ p(s|zi; θd), for any j in the neighborhood of si. The conditional distribution learned from the decoder is parameterized by θd. Figure 1b illustrates the neighborhood hypothesis.\nFurthermore, in our trimmed skip-thought model, for a given sentence si, the decoder needs to reconstruct the sentences in its neighborhood {si−1, si+1}, which are two targets. We denote the inference process as si → {si−1, si+1}. For the next sentence si+1, the inference process is si+1 → {si, si+2}. In other words, for a given sentence pair {si, si+1}, the inference process includes si → si+1 and si+1 → si. In the neighborhood hypothesis [7], the model doesn’t distinguish between the sentences in a neighborhood. As a result, an inference process that includes both si → si+1 and si+1 → si is equivalent to an inference process with only one of them. Thus, we define a trimmed skip-thought model with only one target, presented in Figure 1c, and the target is always the next sentence. The objective at each time step is defined as the log-likelihood of the predicted word given the previous words, which is\n`ti,j(θe, θd) = log p(w t j |w<tj , zi; θe, θd) (1)\nwhere θe is the set of parameters in the encoder, and θd is the set of parameters in the decoder. The objective function is summed across the whole training corpus, then the objective during training is\nmax θe,θd ∑ i ∑ t `ti,i+1(θe, θd) (2)"

      "text" : "In skip-thought models [6], only the hidden state at the last time step produced from the RNN encoder is regarded as the vector representation for a given sentence, and serves as the conditional information for the decoder to reconstruct the adjacent 2 sentences.\nRecently, [9] collected a large corpus, which is SNLI, for textual entailment recognition. Given a sentence pair including premise and hypothesis, the task is to classify the relationship of the sentence pair, entailment, contradiction or neutral. [11] proposed to summarize the hidden states from all time steps computed from a RNN encoder as a sentence representation. While [8] proposed to concatenate the outputs from an average pooling function and a max pooling function, which both run over all time steps, to serve as a sentence representation, and showed a performance boost on the SNLI dataset.\nThe concatenation of an average pooling and a max pooling function is actually a non-parametric composition function, and the computation load is negligible compare to heavy matrix multiplication. Also, the non-linearity of the max pooling function augments the average pooling function for building a representation that captures more complex composition of the context information. Given\na sentence si, the encoder produces a set of hidden states [h1i ;h 2 i ; ...;h N i ], the composition function could be represented as zi = [ 1 N ∑N n=1 h n i ; max N n=1 h n i ] .\nHere, since our goal is to simplify and accelerate the skip-thought model, and also get comparable results on the evaluation tasks, we consider comparing the 2 different composition functions, which are the original one used in the skip-thought model [6], denoted as Plain Connection, and the function proposed by [8], denoted as Average+Max Connection. We hypothesize that the composition function by concatenating two pooling functions will help the model perform better on tasks that involve judging the relationship of a sentence pair, while it is hard to say if the model would benefit from it on the classification benchmark. We will discuss the results in Section 4."

To make the comparison fair, we follow the encoder design by [6]. Since the comparison among different recurrent units is not our main focus, we decide to work with GRU, which is fast and stable. In addition, [3] shows that, on language modeling tasks, GRU performs as well as the long short-term memory (LSTM) [2]. We also reimplemented the skip-thought model under the same settings, according to [6], and the publicly available theano code 1. We adopted the multi-GPU training scheme from the Facebook’s implementation of ResNet2.\nThe experiments with bi-directional encoder and unidirectional encoder were both conducted in [6], and we follow the design of these experiments. For training efficiency, we didn’t follow the exact same dimensionality used. In [6], for bi-skip model, the encoder contains a bi-directional GRU with 1200 dimension of each, for uni-skip model, the encoder contains a uni-directional GRU with 2400 dimension, and the decoder is a one-layer with 2400 dimension.\nIn our experiments, except for Section 4.4, the bi-directional encoder contains a forward and a backward GRU of 300 dimension each, and the uni-directional encoder contains a forward GRU of 600 dimension. After training the 2 models with 2 different encoders separately, we concatenate the vectors produced from 2 encoders to form a sentence representation, and evaluate the performance on evaluation tasks. The decoder is a one-layer unidirectional RNN with GRU, and the dimension is 600. The dimension of word embedding is 300.\nFor stable training, we use ADAM [17] algorithm for optimization. The gradient will be cut off to make it within [−1, 1]. For the purpose of fast training, all the sentences were zero-padded or clipped to have the same length.\nThe vocabulary for unsupervised training is set to contain the top 20k most frequent words in BookCorpus. In order to generalize the model trained with relatively small, fixed vocabulary to a large amount of English words, [6] proposed a word expansion method that learns a linear projection from the pretrained word embeddings word2vec [13] to the learned RNN word embeddings. Thus, the model benefits from the generalization ability of the pretrained word embeddings.\n1https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts 2https://github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch"

After unsupervised training on the BookCorpus dataset, we fix the parameters in the encoder, and apply it as a sentence representation extractor on the 7 tasks.\nFor SICK and MSRP tasks, we adopt the feature engineering idea proposed by [25]. For a given sentence pair, the encoder computes a pair of representations, denoted as u and v, and the concatenation of the component-wise product u · v and the absolute difference |u − v| is regarded as the feature vector for the given sentence pair. Then we train logistic regression on the feature vector to predict the semantic relatedness score. The evaluation metrics for SICK are Pearson’s r, Spearman’s ρ, and mean squared error MSE, and the performance is reported as accuracy and F1-score (Acc/F1) for MSRP. The performance on TREC is presented as test accuracy, and 10-fold cross validation is applied to evaluate the model on the MR, CR, SUBJ, and MPQA classification benchmarks.\nTable 2 presents the models and results, where the model name is given by encoder type - model type.

From the table, we can tell that our trimmed skip-thought models perform slightly better than the skip-thought models overall, yet not significantly, but the performance on the TREC dataset is worse than the skip-thought models. The general performance comparison between our trimmed skip-thought model and the skip-thought model proves that the neighborhood hypothesis is reasonable, which means that the neighborhood information is effective for distributed sentence representation learning. In addition, our trimmed skip-thought model runs faster in training, since our model only needs to reconstruct its next sentence while the skip-thought model needs to reconstruct its two surrounding sentences.\nUnlike the results in [7], these models presented in this paper contain word embeddings with lower dimension, which is half of that in [7], and GRUs with much smaller size. Also, our models presented here use word2vec [13] as word embeddings initialization, which is different from random initialization applied in [7].\nThe results of our implemented skip-thought model differ from those presented in [6], (also presented here in the last section in Table 2), since our implementation contains much fewer parameters than the original skip-thought model, and it has word2vec [13] initialization. Overall, our implementation reaches similar performance on all tasks except Sick.

Greedy decoding is applied for sentence generation. Table 5 presents the generated sentences.\nWe observe that, the generated sentences tend to start with i ’m not, and i do n’t. It might be caused the corpus bias, since there exists a large amount of sentences that start with i ’m not, i do n’t, etc. In addition, the decoder is trained to reconstruct the next sentence in the model, which could be think of as a sentential contextual extension of the input sentence, while the generated sentences rarely are related to the associated input sentences, which is same for the skip-thought models.

      "heading" : "6 Related Work",
      "text" : "Previously, [12] proposed the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model and the skip-gram model for distributed word representation learning. The main idea is learn a word representation by discovering the context information from the surrounding words. [13] improved the skip-gram model, and empirically showed that additive composition of the learned word representations successfully captures contextual information of phrases and sentences, which is a strong baseline model for NLP tasks. Similarly, [26] proposed a method to learn a fixed-dimension vector for each sentence by predicting the words within the given sentence. However, after training, the representation for a new sentence is hard to derive, since it requires optimizing the sentence representation towards an objective.\nRecent research in deep learning shows that, the word representation and the their composition could be done at the same time in an end-to-end machine learning system. LSTM-based autoencoder model for language representation learning was proposed by [5]. For a specific dataset, the model first was trained in an unsupervised fashion and then finetuned for the supervised task. The model didn’t outperform previous CBOW models significantly, but it shows that knowledge learned through unsupervised pretraining could be transfered to augment the performance on the supervised tasks.\nThe skip-thought model was proposed by [6] for learning a generic, distributed sentence encoder, and its key idea was inspired by the skip-gram model [12]. The results on 8 evaluation tasks are promising with no finetuning on the encoder, and some of the results reach other supervised trained models. In [27], they finetuned the skip-thought models on the SNLI corpus [9], which shows that the skip-thought pretraining scheme is generalizable to other specific NLP tasks.\n[28] pointed out that the skip-thought model made use of the sentence-level distributional hypothesis [29, 30]. Following the same hypothesis, [28] proposed FastSent model. It takes summation of the word embeddings in a sentence as the sentence representation, and predicts the words in both the previous sentence and the next sentence. It is an simplification of the skip-thought model, which\nassume the composition function of the words is summation. The results on SICK is comparable with the skip-thought model, while the skip-thought model still outperforms the FastSent model on the other six evaluation tasks. Later, Siamese CBOW [31] aimed to learn the word representations to make the cosine similarity of adjacent sentences in the representation space larger than that of sentences which are not adjacent. The reported comparison with the skip-thought and FastSent models on SICK dataset was convincing that the Siamese CBOW captures better sentence semantics, while no other comparisons on evaluation tasks were reported.\nInstead of learning to reconstruct the sentences which are adjacent to the current sentence, [32] proposed a model that learns to categorize the manually defined relationships of two input sentences. The model encodes two sentences in two representations, respectively, and the classifier on top of the representations judges 1) whether the two sentences are adjacent to each other, 2) whether the two sentences are in the correct order, and 3) whether the second sentence starts with a conjunction phrase. The proposed model runs faster than the skip-thought model, since it only contains an encoder and no decoder is required. However, only the result on microsoft paraphrase detection task is similar to that of the skip-thought model, and the results on other tasks are not as good."

In addition, our proposed trimmed skip-thought model contains much fewer parameters, which runs much faster than skip-thought model. Furthermore, our model could be facilitated by various connection methods between the encoder and the decoder, and benefit from a larger model size. Future research could make use of proposed techniques on unsupervised representation learning, and generalize to more sophisticated model types."

In this paper, we propose a suite of techniques to trim and improve it. First, we validate a hypothesis that, given a current sentence, inferring the previous and inferring the next sentence provide similar supervision power, therefore only one decoder for predicting the next sentence is preserved in our trimmed skip-thought model. Second, we present a connection layer between encoder and decoder to help the model to generalize better on semantic relatedness tasks. Third, we found that a good word embedding initialization is also essential for learning better sentence representations. We train our model unsupervised on a large corpus with contiguous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 supervised tasks, which includes semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and text classification benchmarks. We empirically show that, our proposed model is a faster, lighter-weight and equally powerful alternative to the original skip-thought model.",
