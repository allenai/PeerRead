      "text" : "very important meaning in order to see the extent of achievement of the development of certain areas as well as the difference. Factors that could be used as a tool to measure the inequality of development is to look at the average growth and development contribution of each sector of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) based on the analyzed region and the reference region. This study discusses the development of a model to determine the regional development imbalances using fuzzy approach system, and the rules of typology Klassen. The model is then called fuzzy-Klassen. Implications Product Mamdani fuzzy system is used in the model as an inference engine to generate output after defuzzyfication process. Application of MATLAB is used as a tool of analysis in this study. The test a result of Kota Cilegon is shows that there are significant differences between traditional Klassen typology analyses with the results of the model developed. Fuzzy model-Klassen shows GRDP sector inequality Cilegon City is dominated by Quadrant I (K4), where status is the sector forward and grows exponentially. While the traditional Klassen typology, half of GRDP sector is dominated by Quadrant IV (K4) with a sector that is lagging relative status.\nGeneral Terms Fuzzy systems, and decision support systems.\nKeywords Inequality of regional development, GDP, Klassen typology, fuzzy systems, Mamdani product"

      "text" : "Analysis of development gaps in the study of development economics is basically using Klassen Typology theory by comparing the level of GRDP for the current year with the previous year's, both in terms of total GRDP and GRDPforming sector itself. Klassen typology theory divides the level of development into four quadrants according to the rules of each based on the comparison of the average value of the growth rate and the average contribution of each sector development, in order to obtain certain quadrants of development (as shown in Table 1 for more details).\nThis study intends to conduct discussions in order to generate a new approach to analyze the inequality of development of an area using the concept of fuzzy system combined with Klassen typology. The expected outcome of course is able to provide a new approach to analyze the development disparities from the perspective of information technology.\nBoth methods have advantages in accordance with the position of each concept. Klassen typology widely used by scientists to determine the quadrant of the development of an area by analyzing the existing GRDP sector, for example, to determine the dominant sector economy of a region in order to determine the level of development that has been achieved [1],[2]. So is the concept of fuzzy logic, has been widely implemented in various fields, especially associated with the production planning of a company [3], developing of an auto zoom digital camera [4], the determination of ground water quality [5], assessment of fruit quality for import requirements [6], wormhole detection in computer networks [7], intrusion detection system [8], edge detection for digital image processing [9], forecasting annual rainfall [10], setting temperature and humidity of the room [11] and simulation of the traffic light settings [12]. On this basis then, this research will develop a new model as a tool to analyze the inequality of development of the region by incorporating the concept of fuzzy systems and Klassen typology. This model is expected to carry out the determination of regional development imbalances quadrant based sub-sector gross regional domestic product (GRDP). The model developed later called fuzzyKlassen.\nThis study is divided into six sections. The first section discusses the basic background of the research conducted; the second part contains study the literature and theoretical basis used in the study. The third part is a research methodology that includes the steps of research. The fourth section describes the multi-fuzzy system models proposed, the fifth section discusses the results of research and scientific discussions related to testing the model against real case for the determination of the level of development of a region quadrants according to a particular sector. The final section contains conclusions and suggestions for further research in the future."

      "text" : "A fuzzy system is a knowledge-based system that contains rule-based or fuzzy IF-THEN rules that contain a statement that is characterized by a membership function (MF) which is continuous. Basically every fuzzy systems will use a different principle from each other while doing a combination of rules, both the pure fuzzy systems, and TSK fuzzy system with fuzyfication and defuzzyfication.\nThe main problems faced by the pure fuzzy systems is that the input and output of fuzzy sets (in the form of natural language), whereas in engineering science, the input and output of real values of a variable. For this reason, Takagi, Sugeno and Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems proposed in another form, so that the input and the output can be either real values of a variable. While the main problems in the TSK fuzzy systems are, first, THEN part of the form of mathematical equations that do not provide a natural framework for representing knowledge in persons, both, are not given the freedom to use different principles in fuzzy logic, so the usefulness of fuzzy systems that others do not well represented. To overcome the problem of TSK, was proposed three types of fuzzy systems, namely fuzzy system with fuzzyfication and defuzzyfication [13].\nThis study will try to use a third fuzzy model approach. Mamdani inference model of the product is used as a method of analysis to develop a Klassen typology, although it could use models other inference."

However, the stages of analysis are used by the ways that are on the concept of fuzzy systems. Here is a diagram of the developed model (as shown in figure 1).\nIn the fuzzy model system developed, multi-fuzzy systems are built based on the number of sector GRDP. GRDP sector represents each data input region / district and provincial levels for the current data (t) and the data of previous year (t1). They are Agriculture (V1), Mining and Quarrying (V2), Manufacturing (V3), Electricity, Gas and Water (V4), Building (V5), Trade, Hotels and Restaurants (V6), Transportation and Communications (V7), Finance, Real Estate and Business Services (V8) and Services (V9). Input as well GDP sector data the district / city and province will be analyzed in the developed fuzzy model. In this model, the fuzzy systems are using parameters such as rules of inference Mamdani Product and defuzzyfication with centroid method. Each fuzzy system will produce an output in the form of an average growth rate of development (RD) and the average contribution of the construction (RC) for the district / city and province. Outcomes fuzzy model system such as RD and RC will be compared between the districts of the province. Klassen typology classification rules are used to form the final classification GDP sector imbalances district / city."

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "This research was modeling the development disparities using sector GDP by combining multi-fuzzy system models and rules Klassen typology. The test results in Kota Cilegon showed that in general, the model is able to analyze the inequality sector GRDP of a region. However, this model still requires further studies related to the fuzzy rule used in the process of step 2 and 3 of the model developed. Results obtained between fuzzy-Klassen with traditional Klassen typology showed a highly significant difference. In the model developed, dominated by the inequality Quadrant I (K1) while the traditional typology Klassen shows Quadrant diverse, but dominated by Quadrant IV (K4). The cause of this difference may occur due to the adoption of rules of Klassen less precise, so that the resulting fuzzy rule is still not quite right.\nSubsequent studies, models can be developed by combining decision tree to extract rules from the data classification based typology Klassen using national data. The use of decision tree for forming the rules are expected to form a fuzzy rule is better than the rule in use today. Reinforcement-strengthening the model developed is still needed to enhance the fuzzyKlassen later."

    "abstractText" : "Analysis of regional development imbalances quadrant has a very important meaning in order to see the extent of achievement of the development of certain areas as well as the difference. Factors that could be used as a tool to measure the inequality of development is to look at the average growth and development contribution of each sector of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) based on the analyzed region and the reference region. This study discusses the development of a model to determine the regional development imbalances using fuzzy approach system, and the rules of typology Klassen. The model is then called fuzzy-Klassen. Implications Product Mamdani fuzzy system is used in the model as an inference engine to generate output after defuzzyfication process. Application of MATLAB is used as a tool of analysis in this study. The test a result of Kota Cilegon is shows that there are significant differences between traditional Klassen typology analyses with the results of the model developed. Fuzzy model-Klassen shows GRDP sector inequality Cilegon City is dominated by Quadrant I (K4), where status is the sector forward and grows exponentially. While the traditional Klassen typology, half of GRDP sector is dominated by Quadrant IV (K4) with a sector that is lagging relative status. General Terms Fuzzy systems, and decision support systems.",
