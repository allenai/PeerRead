      "context" : "\" Paris provides a rigorous proof of the result, assuming that the range of Bel is contained in [0; 1] and using assumptions similar to those of Horvitz, Heckerman, and Langlotz. In particular, he assumes that F is continuous and strictly increasing in (0; 1]2 and that S is decreasing. However, he makes use of one additional assumption that, as he himself says, is not very appealing: A4. For all 0 ; ; 1 and > 0, there are sets U1 U2 U3 U4 such that U3 6= ;, and each of jBel(U4jU3) j, jBel(U3jU2) j, and jBel(U2jU1) j is less than . Notice that this assumption forces the range of Bel to be dense in [0; 1]. This means that, in particular, the domain W on which Bel is de ned cannot be nite. Is this assumption really necessary? Paris suggests that Acz el needs something like it. (This issue is discussed in further detail below.) The counterexample of this paper gives further evidence. It shows that Cox's result fails in nite domains, even if we assume that the range of Bel is in [0; 1], S(x) = 1 x (so that, in particular, S is twice di erentiable and monotonically decreasing), G(x; y) = x + y, and F is in nitely di erentiable and strictly increasing on (0; 1]2. We can further assume that F is commutative, F (0; x) = F (x; 0) = 0, and that F (x; 1) = F (1; x) = x. The example emphasizes the point that the applicability of Cox's result is far narrower than was previously believed. It remains an open question as to whether there is an appropriate strengthening of the assumptions that does give us Cox's result in nite settings. There is further discussion of this issue in Section 5. In fact, the example shows even more. In the course of his proof, Cox claims to show that F must be an associative function, that is, that F (x; F (y; z)) = F (F (x; y); z). For the Bel of the counterexample, there can be no associative function F satisfying A2. It is this observation that is the key to showing that there is no probability distribution isomorphic to Bel. What is going on here? Actually, Cox's proof just shows that F (x; F (y; z)) = F (F (x; y); z) only for those triples (x; y; z) such that, for some sets U1, U2, U3, and U4, we have x = Bel(U4jU3 \\ U2 \\ U1), y = Bel(U3jU2 \\ U1), and z = Bel(U2jU1). If the set of such triples (x; y; z) is dense in [0; 1]3, then we conclude by continuity that F is associative. The content of A4 is precisely that the set of such triples is dense in [0; 1]3. Of course, if W is nite, we cannot have density. As my counterexample shows, we do not in general have associativity in nite domains. Moreover, this lack of associativity can result in the failure of Cox's theorem. A similar problem seems to exist in Acz el's proof (as already observed by Paris (1994)).",

In his seminal book on probability and qualitative probability (1973), Fine considers a non-numeric notion of comparative (conditional) probability, which allows us to say \\U given V is at least as probable as U 0 given V 0\", denoted U jV U 0jV 0. Conditions on are given that are claimed to force the existence of (among other things) a function Bel such that U jV U 0jV 0 i Bel(U jV ) Bel(U 0jV 0) and an associative function F satisfying A2. (This is Theorem 8 of Chapter II in (Fine, 1973).) However, the Bel de ned in my counterexample to Cox's theorem can be used to give a counterexample to this result as well. Interestingly, this is not the rst time a similar error has been noted in the use of functional equations. Falmagne (1981) gives another example (in a case involving a utility model of choice behavior) and mentions that he knows \\of at least two similar examples in the psychological literature\".",

There are two ways to interpret this assumption. The weak interpretation is that for each x 2 [0; 1], there exist U; V such that Bel(V jU) = x.

The claim that the function F must be associative in Fine's theorem is incorrect. Fine has an analogous result (Fine, 1973, Chapter II, Theorem 4) for unconditional comparative probability involving a function G as in Acz el's theorem. This function too is claimed to be associative, and again, this does not seem to follow (although my counterexample does not apply to that theorem). Of course, the interesting question now is what it would take to recover Cox's theorem. Paris's assumption A4 su ces, as does the stronger assumption of nonatomicity (see Footnote 4). As we have observed, A4 forces the domain of Bel to be in nite, as does the assumption that the range of Bel is all of [0; 1]. We can always extend a domain to an in nite|indeed, uncountable|domain by assuming that we have an in nite collection of independent fair coins, and that we can talk about outcomes of coin tosses as well as the original events in the domain. (This type of \\extendibility\" assumption is fairly standard; for example, it is made by Savage (1954) in quite a di erent context.",
