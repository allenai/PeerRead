      "text" : "1 Introduction\nThe problem of inconsistency handling appears when the available knowledge base - KB for short - (here a set of propositional formulas) is inconsistent. Most approaches come up with the inconsistency by select ing among the consistent subsets of KB some preferred subsets; the selection criterion generally makes use of uncertainty considerations, sometimes by using explic itly uncertainty measures (such as Wilson [27 ], Ben ferhat and Smets [2)), or more often using measures expressed qualitatively as priorities (the idea comes back to Rescher [20] and has been developed by many authors, among them Brewka [3], Nebel [16], Cayrol [4], Benferhat, Cayrol, Dubois, Lang, Prade [1] and Lehmann [14]). Although these priorities are gener ally not given a semantics in terms of uncertainty mea sures (however see [1] for a comparative study of the priority-based and possibilistic approaches to inconsis tency handling), their intuitive interpretation is clearly in terms of gradual uncertainty: the least prioritary formulas (i.e., the ones which are most likely to be re jected in case of inconsistency) are clearly the ones we are the least confident in, i.e., the least certain ones. All aforementioned priority-based approaches consist in ranking the f{ B in n priority levels (assume that 1 is the highest priority and n the lowest) and maximize the set or the number of formulas satisfied at each\nlevel, with the condition that violating however many formulas at a given level is always more acceptable than violating only one formula at a strictly higher level: thus these approaches are non-compensatory, z. e., levels never interact.\nAn alternative approach, more or less empirical but apparently very appealing (besides it has already been used several times in the literature) consists in weight ing formulas with positive numbers called penalties. Contrarily to priorities, penalties are compensatory since they are additive: the global penalty for rejecting a set of formulas is the sum of the elementary penal ties of the rejected formulas. Moreover, inviolable (or unrejectable) formulas are given an infinite penalty. The additive combination of penalties leads to an in terpretation in terms of cost, thus this criterion is util itarist, contrarily to priority-based approaches which are rather egalitarist. This additive criterion is very in tuitive, since rejecting a formula generally causes some \"additive\" trouble with the experts which provided the f{ B with the formulas, or some real financial cost, or another kind of additive cost. Note that a degenerate case of penalties (all penalties being equal to 1) prefers subsets of maximum cardinality. Moreover, and as we will see later, these penalties can sometimes be inter preted as the \"probability of fault\" of the source which provided us with the information (all sources failing in dependently), up to a logarithmic transformation. In any case, these penalties can be viewed as measuring uncertainty since, again, the less expensive to reject, the more uncertain the piece of information. Thus, penalty logic expresses uncertainty in terms of costs. However a formal connection of penalties with classical theories of uncertainty has not really been made.\nPenalty-based approaches have been already used sev eral times in the literature, first by Pinkas 91 [17] (from whom we borrowed the terminology \"penalty\") who uses them for inconsistency handling and for mod elling symmetric neural networks behavior, and also by Eiter and Gotlob 94 [10] for cost-based abduction, by Sandewall 92 [21] for cost-based minimization of surprises in temporal reasoning and by Freuder and Wallace [12] for tackling inconsistencies in Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Moreover, penalties associated\nto formulas have also been used for guiding the search in randomized algorithms dedicated to the satisfiabil ity problems, such as GSAT [23, 22]. Lastly, there should clearly be a link between penalties and utility theory (the latter has been recently used in AI, espe cially in decision-theoretic planning - see e.g. [18]); however, in this paper we do not investigate this pos sible link.\nIn this paper we revisit penalties by giving a further formalization of Pinkas' work; we also go further in the theoretical study of penalty-based inconsistency han dling and non-monotonic reasoning. We briefly give a formalization in penalty logic of an additive O.R. problem. Lastly, we establish a link between penalties and Dempster-Shafer theory; this link is twofold: first, the penalty function (on interpretations) is equivalent, up to a log- transformation, to a contour function (i.e., the plausibility function restricted to singletons); then penalty functions on formulas coincide with plausibil ity functions of an infinitesimal t'ersion of Dempst.er Shafer theory.\n2 Penalty logic\n2.1 Formal definitions\nIn the following, .2' will be a propositional language based on a finite number of propositional variables. T and .l will represent tautology and contradiction re spectively. Formulas of .2' will be written '{), 1j!, etc. The set of interpretations attached to .2' will be de noted by n, and an interpretation by w. 'P F= 1/! and 'P f=l'lj! will represent logical consequence and logical equivalence between the formulas 'P and 1/! respectively. I== will also be used between an interpretation and a formula to denote satisfiahility. The set of models of a formula 'P will be denoted by M ( 'P); the set of for mulas of .2' satisfied by w, i.e., {'P I w I== 'P} will be denoted by [w ]. A classical knowledge base 91 is a set of formulas of .2'. A sub-theory of 91 is a consistent subset of §9. A maximal sub-theory T of §9 is a consistent subset of 91 such that 'if'{) E 91 \\ T, T U { 'P} is inconsistent. Given a formula 1/!, T is said 'ljl-consistent iff T U { 1j!} is con sistent; Tis maximal'lj!-consistent if it is 1/J-consistent and V'P E §9 \\ T, T U { '{), 1/!} is inconsistent. w+ will be the union of the set of all the strictly positive real numbers and { +oo }, equipped with the usual order (in particular, if a: #- +oo then a: < +oo). A penalty knowledge base PK is a finite multi-set of pairs {'P;, a:;) where '{); E .2' and a:; E w+. a; is the penalty associated to 'Pi; it represents intuitively what we s hould pay in order to get rid of 'Pi, if we pay the requested price we do not need any longer to satisfy 'Pi; so the larger a:; is, the more important 'Pi is.\nIn particular, if a:; ::: +oo then it is forbidden to re move i.p; from PK ('Pi is inviolable).\nSince PK is a multi-set of pairs (and not a. set), it. is possible for a pair{'{), a:) to appear several times in PI\\; for example, PK = {{a, 1), {a, 1)} is not equivalent to PK' = {{a, 1}} since using PK, it costs 2 to delete a and using PK', it costs only 1.\nHowever, as we will see in 2.1.4, if a formula'{) appears several times in PK then we may replace all the occur rences of the formula 'P by only one occurrence of 'P annotated with the sum of the penalties associated to this formula in the previous base. The new knowledge base obtained is equivalent to the initial base.\n91c will be the set of all the penalty knowledge bases. Note that when the penalties are all infinite, penalty logic comes down to classical logic (no formula can be violated).\nLastly, we will say that PK E !JlJc is consistent if the set of formulas 'Pi of PK is consistent ( without mentioning the penalties ex;). Also, in the expressions sub-theory of PK, subset of PK and PK \\A we will refer to the set of formulas obtained from PK by ignoring the pena.lties.\n2.1.1 Cost of an interpretation\nLet PK = {{'{);,a:;},i = 1 .. . n} be a penalty knowl edge base.\nDefinition 1 (Pinkas 91 [17]) The cost of an in terpretation w E Q with respect to PK , denoted by kpK( w ), is equal to the sum of the penalties of the for mulas zn PK violated by w:\n(with the corn,enfion L:1P,E0 a:;= 0)\nDefinition 2 A PK-preferred interpretation is an in terpretation of minimal cost w.r.t. PK, i.e. an inter pretation minimizing kpl(.\nAs an example, let us consider the following penalty knowledge base PK1:\n'PI =a y2 = b v c y3 = -.b 'P4 = -.c\n0:1 = +oo 0:2 = 10 0:3 = 5 0:4 = 7\nHere are the corresponding interpretations costs:\nkpr<, ({-,a, b, c}) kpr<, ( {...,a, b, .....,c}) kpK,({a,-,b,--.c}) kpK,({a,b,-.c}) kpK,({a,•b,c}) kPK,({a,b,c})\nkpK, ( { •a, •b, c}) = +oo kpK, ( { •a, •b, •c}) = +oo 10 5 7 5 + 7 = 12\nIf the interpretations are decisions to make (for exam ple if the knowledge base is made of constraints con cerning the construction of a timetable), then a min imum cost interpretation corresponds to the cheapest\ndecision, i.e., the most interesting one. The cheapest interpretation is generally not unique. Besides, if the penalties are all equal to 1 then a cheapest interpreta tion satisfies a maximum consistent subset of PK w .r. t. cardinality.\n2.1.2 Cost of consistency of a formula\nDefinition 3 The cost of consistency of a formula r.p with respect to PK, denoted by f{ PK ( cp), is the mini mum cost with respect to PK of an interpretation sat isfying r.p:\nKpK(C,O) =min kpK(w) wi='P\n(with the convention min0 kPK(w) = +oo)\nExample:\nf{PK1 (a!\\ b) 5 KpK,(a-+c) 7 KPK,(-.a) +oo\nThe cost KpK('f') of a formula r.p, is the minimal price to pay in order to make PK consistent with cp. For example, in order to make PK1 consistent with a -+ c, the least expensive way is to remove r,o4.\nProperty 1 J(PK(l..) minwEn{kPK(w)}\n+oo and J( PK ( T)\nAll proofs can be found (in French) in Dupin de Saint Cyr, Lang and Schiex 94 [8] and in Dupin de Saint-Cyr 93 [7). KPK(l_) = +oo is easy to understand, because it is impossible to have PK consistent with 1... Let us note that /(pK (T) is the cost of any PK-preferred inter pretation; it is thus the minimum cost to make PK consistent.\nProperty 2 KpK(T) = +oo ¢} {cp; E PK,a;:::: +oo} is inconsistent.\nThis quantity KPK(T) is important, because it mea sures the strength of the inconsistency of PK (i.e., how expensive it will be to recover the consistency). If the penalties are all equal to +oo then KpK(T) can only take two values: 0 if and only if PK is consistent, and +oo if and only if PK is inconsistent. Example: J(PK, (T) = 5; the only minimum cost in terpretation is {a, b, -.c }. To make PK1 consistent, the least expensive solution is to take off (or to ignore) the formula 'f'3·\nProperty 3 /(pK(T) = 0 ¢} PK is consistent.\nIndeed, if KpK(T) = 0 then there is no need to delete any formula in order to make PK consistent, therefore PK is consistent (and conversely).\nProperty 4 'Vi.p, ¢ E .!f, (cp f= ¢) :::::} KpJ<('P) 2: KPK(?/;)\nThis property is the monotonicity of K with respect to classical entailment.\nProperty 5 'Vr,o, ¢ E 2:\n1.

Proposition 5 (((0, +oo), ::::) instead of ((0, 1), S)), /{pK is actually a possibil ity measure. Note also that Spohn's ordinal condi tional functions x: verify property 2 1. e. x:( A U B) = min(x:(A), x:(B)) [26).\n2.1.3 Cost of a sub-theory\nDefinition 4 (Pinkas 91 [17J) The cost CPK(A) of a sub-theory A of PK, is the sum of the penalties of the formulas of PK that are not in A:\n{!f'.,<:>,)EPK\\A\nFor instance, considering the knowledge base PK1, given A1 = {i.pl,i.p2,'P3} and A2 = {r,o2,i.p4}, we have CPK1 (Al) = a4 = 7 and CpK1 (A2) = 0:1 + a3 = +oo.\nDefinition 5 'VA, B � PK,\nB 2:PK A (B is preferred to A) ifJCPK(B) S CPK(A). 'VA, B � PK , B >h A if and only if B 2:PK A and not A 2:PK B.\nDefinition 6 (Pinkas 91 [17]) A � PK is a pre ferred sub-theory relatively to PK (or 2:PK preferred) if and only if A is consistent and ,3 B � PK, such that B is consistent and B >f,K A.\nNote that there may be several preferred sub-theories (in the previous example, { cp1, 'P2, 1p4} is the only one 2:PK1-preferred sub-theory).\nProperty 6 'VPK E fflc, If J<pK (T) ::f +oo, then any 2:PK -preferred sub-theory is a maximal sub-theory of PK w. r.t. inclusion.\n• Let us notice that when KPK(T) = +oo, every sub-theory of PK has an infinite cost, therefore every sub-theory of PK is 2:PK-preferred, but ob viously every sub-theory is not necessarily maxi mal w.r.t. inclusion.\n• Besides, if PK is consistent, then I<PK(T) = 0, and then the only >pK-preferred sub-theory of PK is PK itself (its Zost is 0).\nExample (continued): A3 = {r,ol,'f'2,'P4} is a 2:PK, preferred sub-theory and it is maximal w.r.t. inclusion.\nPenalty Logic and its Link with Dempster-Shafer Theory 207\nBut, although {cp2,cp3,cp4} is a maximalsub-t.heory of PK1 (w.r.t. inclusion), it is not 2:-PK,-preferred (be cause its cost is infinite).\nIf we add the formula (cps = -,a, a5 = +oo} to PK1 then the subset of infinite cost formulas is inconsistent, therefore every sub-theory has an infinite cost, and every sub-theory is a preferred sub-theory.\nProperty 7 The cost kpK(w) of an interpretation w E 0 with respect to PK is equal to the cost of the sub theory of PK composed of all the formulas satisfying w:\nCorollary 7.1 Vw E 0,\nw has a minimal cost U.'.r.f.

As �Pl< is a complete pre-ordering, we immediately get the follow ing result:\nProperty 11 f-.- �K zs a comparative inference relation1.\nProperty 12 Given PK E �c and cp, 1/J E 2', with 'P * 1.,\nFor instance, let us consider the following penalty knowledge base PK:\n{(a V b , +oo), (---.a 5),\n(-,av--.b , 4), {b--+ --.c 2),\n(a --+ c 1)} It can be checked that:\nf-.- �I< •c a f-.- �I< c\n(al\\b) f---�K •c\n1 A comparative inference relation (13] is a rational rela tion [15] that also satisfies supraclassicality: if 'P F '1/1 then 'Pb--�K'f/;.\n2.3 An application of penalty logic: maximum clique in a graph\nIn this section, we will see that penalty logic is not only a tool for inconsistency handling but also a good way to represent, in a logical language, discrete opti mization problems (for instance issued from operation research), in which minimum cost interpretations cor respond to optimum solutions.\nWe consider an undirected graph G, i.e., a set of ver tices U and a set of edges V connecting those vertices. A clique of G is a subset of V which define a complete sub-graph (i.e., every vertex is connected with every other vertex). Finding a maximum cardinality clique is a classical N P-ha.rd problem in operational research. In penalty logic we can represent it like this:\n• to each vertex s E U, we can associate a propo sitional variable s which truth assignation means that this vertex belongs to the clique we are look ing for.\n• we are searching for a set of vertices which is max imum for cardinality, so we have to exclude the minimum of vertices: to each vertex we associate the penalty formula {s, 1).\n• the resulting set must be a clique so for each pair ( x, y) of vertices that are not connected in the graph G (i.e., (x, y) � V), at least either x or y does not belong to the clique. In consequence, we can associate to each pair (x, y) � V the penalty formula (...,x V -,y, +oo).\nLet PK(G) = {(s, l),s E U}U{(...,xV---.y,+oo),(x,y) � V}.\nProperty 13 (see [8]) Every minimum cost inter pretation with respect to PI<( G) corresponds to a max imum clique of G and conversely.\nExample:\na d e\nb c\n(a, l)(b, l}(c, 1} (d, l)(e, 1} (•a V •c, +oo) {---.a V ---.d, +oo) (•a V •e, +oo} (-,b V •e, +oo) (--.c V •e, +oo)\nThe minimum cost interpretation is {-.a, b, c, d, -.e}. This example shows the ability of penalty logic to en code discrete optimization problems. One could ar gue that, in operation research, algorithms for solv ing classical problems (as maximum clique, minimum vertex cover ... ) do already exist. Those algorithms are probably more efficient than the one consisting in finding the best interpretation in penalty logic ( devel oped in [7]). However, the logical representation of this kind of problems presents at least two advantages: the\nPenalty Logic and its Link with Dempster-Shafer Theory 209\ngreat power of expression of logic allows us to spec ify many complicated problems which could not easily be specified within the operational research language; and the best solution search method is independent of the given problem.\n3 Relating penalties to Dempster-Shafer theory\nIn this section we are going to show:\n• first, that the cost of an interpretation kpK : rl ---+ [0, +oo) induced by a penalty knowledge base PK consisting of n weighted formulas corresponds ac tually to the contour function pl : rl ---+ [0, 1] induced by Dempster's combination of n simple support functions (one for each formula rpi);\n• then , that moreover, the function Kp){ : .5f> - [0, +oo) corresponds to a plausibility measure in an infinitesimal version of Depmster-Shafer the ory.\n3.1 Interpretation costs and contour functions\nLet PK = { (rp;, a;}, i = 1 .. . n} be a penalty knowl edge base. Let us define, for each i, the body of evi dence m;:\nm;(rp; ) = 1- e-a, m; (T) = e -a•\nBy convention we take e-00 = 0. Since a; E [0, +oo], it can be seen that m;(cpi) E (0, 1) and m;(T) E [0, 1). Moreover, note that lim<>,-+co m;(cp;) = 1. m; is called a simple support function [24]. Let m = m1 EfJ · · ·EBmn be the result of Dempster's combination of the m; 's (9] without re-normalization. The contour func tion pl : n -+ [0, 1] associated to m is the restriction of the plausibility function to singletons, i.e.,\npl(w) = Pl( {w}) = L m(rp) Now, it is well-known [24] that\nn Pl({w}) = IT Pl;({w})\ni=l where Pl; is the plausibility function induced by m;. Moreover, Pl;(w) = 1 if w f= 'Pi and Pl;(w) = e-c., if w f= -,'Pi. Thus,\npl(w) ( II 1).( II e-Ct·) i,wl=cp; i,wl=-.cp;\nIT e-c., i,wl=...,<+>•\ne- Lt.�.�t==-.'Pi O'i e-kPK(w)\nTherefore, kpK(w) = -ln(p!(w)): up to a logarithmic transformation, kPK is a contour function, or more pre cisely, the process consisting in computing kpr< corre sponds to applying Dempster's combination without re-norma.lization on simple support functions. This equivalence does not extend to an equivalence between ]{pK and a plausibility function (see subsection 3.2}. but this result is already significant, since in most prac tical applications of penalty logic, only the contour function kpK is useful: this is the case when penal ties are used to induce a preference relation on rl, a.nd then possibly to select one of the (or all) cheapest in t.erpretat.ion(s). Namely, this is enough for inducing the inference relation \\--- �K, for solving discrete op timization problems, and also for applying penalties to constraint satisfaction problems or abduction. So, handling penalties in such a purpose is nothing but performing Dempster's combination on simple sup port functions. Reciprocally, combining simple sup port functions in order to rank interpretations can be done a.lt.erna.ti vely with penalty logic.\nThis also brings to light. a relation bet.ween penalties and [25] where each formula 'Pi of the knowledge base is considered to be given by a distinct source, this source having the probability p; to be faulty (i.e., the infor mation it provides us with is not pertinent), and all sources being independent (which gives the simple sup port function m;(cpi) = (1- p;) and m;(T) = p,:). So if the task is only to find the most plausible interpre tation (as in [11] which is the Constraint Satisfaction counterpart of [25]), it can thus be done equivalently with penalt.iPs.\n3.2 Formula costs as infinitesimal plausibilities\nLet us consider an infinitesimal version of Dempster Shafer theory, where the masses involved are all in finitely close to 0 or to 1. Let c be an infinitely small quantity2•3. Again, let PK = {(cp;,a;},i = 1. .. n}. Let us define, for each i, the infinitesimal body of evi dence m,,;:\nm,,; (r,o;) = 1 - ca' m,,;(T) = ca'\nLet m, = m, 1 tfl· · · ffi m, n be the result of Dempster's combination �f the m; 's '[9) without re-normalization. Let us show now that J( PK has the same order of mag nitude (w.r.t. c) as ln(P/,), where ln(Pl,) is the plau sibility function induced by m,.\nLet us note that the set of focal elements of m, is exactly {\"-iEI'Pi, It;::; {1 ... n}}.\n2More formally, this consists in considering a family of e's tending towards 0; indeed what we are interested in is only the limit of the considered f( I!) when I! tends to 0.\n3We recall that ft(e:) � h(e) iff lim,_o };i:j == 1.\nNow, let us define\nR(PK, w) = {I � { l .. . n}, J\\ ( <p;) i\\ w consistent} iEI\nNow,\nPl('!j!)

So, up to a logarithmic transformation and a multiplicative constant (in other terms, if we consider only the orders of magnitude w. r. t. c:: ), Kpl( is equivalent to an infinitesimal plausi bility function.\n4 Conclusion\nUsed to handle inconsistency and perform non monotonic inferences, penalty logic has shown to have interesting properties. Using penalties for selecting preferred sub-theories of an inconsistent knowledge base not only allows to distinguish between the degree of importance of various formulas, as usual priority based approaches do, but also to express possible com pensations between formulas. The non-monotonic in ference relation defined satisfies the usual postulates [13] and is (logarithmically) related to an infinitesimal version of Dempster-Shafer theory .\nFurthermore, the complexity of the penalty non monotonic deduction problem has been considered in [5] and is ranked as one of the most simple non monotonic inference problem (in��).\nPenalty logic may also been considered as a logical lan guage for expressing discrete optimization problems. The search for a preferred interpretation has been im plemented using an A • -like variant of Davis and Put nam procedure (6] and has been tested on small ex amples. Randomized search algorithms such as GSAT [23, 22] could also be considered, but they do not guar antee that an optimum is actually reached.\nAs shown in [5], solving the problem of searching a preferred interpretation allows to simply solve the non monotonic inference problem, without any restriction on the language of the formulas expressed4. Any way, even the limited ll.� complexity can be consid ered as excessive when faced to practical applications. A reasonable approach would then consist in defining a gradual inference relation and in trying only to solve an approximation of the resulting gradual inference problem.\nAmong the other possible extensions of penalty logic, one could consider associating many unrelated penal ties to a single formula. Partially ordered penalty vec tors would then replace penalties. Another possible ex tension consists in taking into account not only penal ties caused by violations but also profits associated to satisfactions (which could be expressed using negative penal ties).\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to express our thanks to Didier Dubois and Henri Prade for helpful suggestions concerning the link between penalties and Dempster-Shafer the ory, and Michel Cayrol for having found an error in a preliminary version. This work has been partially supported by the ESPRIT BRA project DRUMS-2.\n4 Using an ATMS for computing candidates and pre ferred sub-theories could also be considered, but the re sulting complexity is more important in the general case [19].\nReferences\n[1] S .
