      "text" : "With the recent growth of online reviews, social media and blogs, there has been a lot of attention to mine for subjective information. These sites contains huge amount of data that has loads of subjective information.\nSome of the challenges in Sentiment Analysis are: People express opinions in complex ways, in opinion texts, lexical content alone can be misleading. Humans tend to express a lot of remarks in the form of sarcasm, irony, implication, etc. which is very difficult to interpret. For Example- “How can someone sit through the movie” is extremely negative sentiment yet contains no negative lexographic word. Even if a opinion word is present in the text, their can be cases where a opinion word that is considered to be positive in one situation may be considered negative in another situation. People can be contradictory in their statements. Most reviews will have both positive and negative comments. Sometimes even other people have difficulty understanding what someone thought based on a short piece of text because it lacks context. A good example would be “The laptop is good but I would prefer, the operating system which I was using” here context about the author’s operating sytem is missing.\nThere is a huge demand of sentiment analysis. Before buying any product its a practice now, to review its rating as rated by other persons who are using it. Online advice and recommendations the data reveals is not the only reason behind the buzz in this area. There are other reasons from company’ point of view like, the company wants to know “How Successful was their last campaign or product launch” based upon the reviews of users on websites like Amazon, Yelp, etc.."

      "heading" : "2. PREVIOUS WORKS",
      "text" : "A lot of research has been done in the area over the past decade. Main research in the area of Sentiment Analysis and opinion mining are: sentiment classification, feature based Sentiment classification and opinion summarization. Sentiment classification deals with classifying entire documents or text or review according to the opinions towards certain objects. Feature-based Sentiment classification on the other hand considers the opinions on features of certain objects. For example, in reviews related to laptops classifying the sentiments only on the basis screen quality.\nIn one of the poineer work [2], the authors present a method of subjectivity identification for sentiment analysis based on minimum cuts. This is important because the irrelevant data from the reviews could be eliminated. The problem is viewed as a classification task and different types of Supervised learning techniques have been used in this field. Some of the most common ones are naive Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine[13] , Maxmimum Entropy [1] etc. Even some graph based techniques [4] are also used.\nLanguages that have been studied mostly are English and Chinese. Presently, there are few researches conducted on sentiment classification for other languages like Arabic, Spanish, Italian and Thai. The presented work focuses on English language only."

      "heading" : "3. APPROACH",
      "text" : "This paper uses Thayer’s Model of human emotion [5], to classify text. This two dimensional approach adopts the theory that human emotion can be obtained by: Stress (negative polarity/positive polarity) and Energy (low intensity/high intensity), and divides it into four broad classes: Satisfied, Sad, Exuberent and Angry.\nTwo binary classifiers were trained. First was trained to get the polarity (positive or nagative) of the text. While the second was trained on intensity (low or high) of the text. Figure 1 illustrates the approach."

      "heading" : "3.1 Polarity",
      "text" : "Some existing lexicon resources like Sentiwordnet 3.0 [7] and General Inquirer [9] were used to extract some features from the text. These features were trained using support vector machine, to predict the binary class label.\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n20 22\nv1 [\ncs .I\nR ]\n8 J\nun 2\n01 4"

      "heading" : "3.1.1 Features",
      "text" : "Sentiword score of each review was used as a feature. The score was calculated using the weighted average of the all the synsets (Synonym set, Wordnet [8]) of each word. The weights assigned were based on the ranks of synsets as in wordnet. Thus, giving a value between -1 to 1 depending upon the polarity. Where negative score implies negative polarity and vice versa while 0 being the neutral or no polarity.\nBaseScore = pos− neg (1)\nPolarityScore = basescore+ 1 2 ∗ first+ 1 3 ∗ second.. (2)\ntotal = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ....... (3)\nfinalscore(eachword) = Polarityscore/total (4)\nLet the sum of the sentiword score for each sentence be ’S’ and nubmer of sentences be ’n’. For each sentence in the review, negation words(like: not,cant,wasnt, barely etc.) were detected. For presence of a negation word the sentence score was multiplied by -1. Finally each sentence score was averaged to get the Sentiword based score for each review.\nTotalReviewScore = ΣS\nn (5)\nA set of 178 features were based on the frequency of categories marked by General Inuirer. For each word a set of category/labels has been marked. Categories includes positive, negative, active, passive, direct, indirect, etc.\nSome other features like emoticons, number of words in quotes were also used."

      "heading" : "3.2.1 Features",
      "text" : "Some of the features used are: all capital text, for example: “I am EXTREMELY unhappy”. Elongated words have also been used as one of the features. Its a common practice especially in online reviews that people use, elongated words. For example “The pizza was verryyyyyy verryyyyyy gooood!!” Another feature includes the count of exlaimation marks, people tend to put exlamation marks to show the level of their excitement, for example “The coffee was too cold!!!” Count of Adverbs was also taken.\nFinally the frequency of 178 categories from General Inquirer were also included. The frequency was used in the same way as in Polarity."

Created a dataset of 5000 (2500 positive and 2500 negative) reviews for training polarity and another 5000 (2500 low intensity and 2500 high intensity) to train intensity. Used the following proxy:\nConsidered ratings with 5 star as Positive polarity\nConsidered ratings with 1 star as Negative polarity.\nConsidered ratings with 1 or 5 star as High Intensity.\nConsidered ratings with 3 star as Low Intensity."

      "heading" : "4.3 Other Approaches tried",
      "text" : "The following techniques were tried after removing stopwords and spell correction. The mean accuracy is for 10 fold cross validation on LIBSVM.\nThe model did not performed very well while using all the unigrams. One possible reason could be, that the feature size was huge. It performed slightly better when only used Adjective and Adverbs. Stemming [10] the unigrams had almost no effect on the results.\nThe results were improved just by using the K-top words occuring in the corpus, which was 2000 in this case. One of the shortcomings with all the approaches mentioned in the table is that all of them are dependant on the training Dataset. Thus, the trained model is specific to the domain and the types of words used in the dataset. These model will not be as effective for all types of text. For example, words like Coffee, restaurent, movie, yummy, pizza etc. had high frequency in the presented Dataset, which are not that common in a more General scenario.\nThe table above presents some of the techniques that did not work out well. Considering unigram features, for a relatively small dataset did not worked out. Even omitting some of the categories (Categories, in General Iquirer) that were generic, the results were not good. Some of the categories that were omitted in the above approach are, ’Doctrine’, ’Economics’, ’religion’ ’Politics’ etc."

      "text" : "Using Thayer’s model, the following are the Mappings in 2-Dimensional Emotional space, using the binary labels of Polarity and Intensity as shown in table 6.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nDiscovered a unique way to classify text in two-dimensions and map to a emotion using Thayer’s Model. Did an analysis of various different techniques and compared their results.\nThe proposed model for polarity was able to achieve results (81.60%) which is comparable to current state of the art techniques. The approach used lexicon based features to train the model. The Learned model does not use any corpus specific features for the training. The model uses predefined set of categories that are generic. These catagories can be applied to any English word. Although, some of the features used are dependant on “Internet Lingo”, but they are not specific to a domain. Therefore the model could, be applied to the text of various other domains.\nUsed Intensity of text as a seperate dimension and created an annotated dataset. All the features used for training Intensity were not specific to the dataset. This approach can be used in any domain."
