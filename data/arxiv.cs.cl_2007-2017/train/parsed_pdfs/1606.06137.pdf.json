      "text" : "Proactive systems [31] anticipate the needs of the user and predict possible next steps based on the user’s preferences and current context. The central component of proactive systems is the inference engine, which analyzes the current context to provide the highest-ranking suggestions. Proactive systems have recently gained popularity, and many of the contemporary major operating systems include proactive components, e.g., Google Now, Apple Siri, and Microsoft Cortana.\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

An ideal search engine would support searching and identifying useful information that can then be used in solving these tasks [33]. In proactive information retrieval [5] the estimation of the current task and context are utilized to proactively retrieve and recommend relevant items. In particular, this can include associative forms of recall, e.g., in a situation where the user does not realize having forgotten about a specific resource [27]. A proactive retrieval system can be viewed as a digital personal assistant that knows the user’s preferences and aims to provide useful and relevant information in the current task context.\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) networks [17] have recently shown remarkable performance in a variety of natural language processing tasks, including speech recognition [16], automatic translation [30], image captioning [35] and information retrieval [18, 26, 28]. LSTM networks have also been used to generate various kinds of sequences, including text [15, 29]. In sequence generation, the network is used to process input sequences one at a time and to sample the next item from the output distribution of the network. The sampled item is then fed to the network as the next input. This capability to predict future continuations of a sequence (viz. text in this case) makes LSTMs particularly attractive for proactive information retrieval.\nA typical example of a task is writing about a given topic [24, 27, 33]. In this paper, we propose a method for supporting the user by proactive information retrieval during a writing task. An LSTM network is used to expand the proactive queries by predicting the most likely continuations of the current written text. An overview of the proposed method is shown in Figure 1. We present simulated experiments to validate the utility of the LSTM predictions in providing relevant documents, and compare the method to a baseline and to another method based on user intent modeling.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the follow-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 13\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n16\ning section a discussion of related work is provided. In Section 3 we describe the components of our proactive retrieval system: the query expansion methods (based on an LSTM and on user intent modeling), and the proactive query generation. In Section 4 we describe our simulation experiments. In Section 5 we present our experimental user interface for providing proactive recommendations based on the current task context. The user interface is used in forthcoming user studies. We conclude and discuss future work in Section 6."

      "heading" : "2. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and LSTMs in particular, have recently been used to generate sequences in various domains, such as music [7], text [15, 29], and handwriting [15]. In information retrieval, RNNs have been used, e.g., for extracting sentence-level semantic vectors [26] and context-aware query suggestion [28]. Other kinds of deep neural networks have been used to project queries and documents to low-dimensional semantic spaces [18] and to learn fixed-length vectors for variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents [21].\nVarious types of task activities have been studied in the literature as a basis for query suggestion or query support. Motivated by the observation that a notable proportion of the user’s information needs were triggered by previous web browsing activity, several authors have studied the correlation between web browsing behavior and consecutive searches [10, 20, 22]. Another popular approach is to use previous search queries [9, 36]. Our work is related to query auto-completion [4], in which possible completions of search engine queries are predicted. Query auto-completion for web and mobile queries has recently been studied in [25, 34].\nA much studied task scenario for intelligent assistants is writing. The existing work has largely focused on bibliographic tasks involved in writing scientific or professional texts [3, 23, 32]. These mostly target either the planning or review phases of writing, as translation, i.e., transforming the writer’s mental ideas into sentences, is the most challenging process in terms of tolerance to undesired disruptions. In [24], the impact of proactive recommendations to different phases of the writing process is analyzed. The Reactive Keyboard [11] is an early prototype for predicting the succeeding words from a user-written text fragment. Completing written sentences has also been studied in [6, 14].\nThe setup of our work is closely related to what was envisioned already by Rhodes and Starner in their Remembrance Agent (RA) [27]. The user first indexes her personal data, e.g., emails and written notes. RA is then set to run continuously in the background and display a list of summaries of documents that are related to the current document being read or written. Other similar tools include Watson [8] and Implicit Query [12]. The main difference of our method compared to these systems is the of use an LSTM-based predictive model to perform query expansion. We also compare our method to a baseline and a method based on user intent modeling. In this paper, we evaluate our method using a simulated writing task, but our method can be applied to other sources of context, such as what is read on the screen."

      "text" : "The proactive recommendations produced by our method are based on user input observed during the current task. To\nimprove the recommendations, we propose to use an LSTMbased method for query expansion described in Section 3.1. For comparison, we use a method based on estimating user intent using a multi-armed bandit model (Section 3.2 and Appendix A). Proactive information retrieval using the expanded query is described in Section 3.3. An overview of the proposed method (and the comparison and baseline methods) is shown in Figure 1."

      "heading" : "3.1 LSTM Text Prediction",
      "text" : "In LSTM-based query expansion, the most probable continuations are estimated for the current written text and the expansion words are selected from these estimated continuations. For computing the continuations, we use a beam search algorithm [19] described below.\nThe LSTM network f is first trained using a text corpus, like abstracts of scientific articles. The trained network can then serve as a model for text generation.\nLet us assume the user has written n input words and denote by w0 the latest word in the input sequence. When given an input word w, the network f will return a probability distribution for the next word, of which we will consider the b most probable candidates. For example, with the\nbranching coefficient b = 4 and w0 = “neural”, the top candidates from f could be {w11 = “model”, w12 = “network”, w13 = “surgery”, w14 = “system”}, where wji denotes the ith candidate for the jth word following the input word w0. The output probability of the word is denoted as p(wji ). Further continuations are computed by using previous candidate words as input to f . Note that the output of f depends not only on the latest input word, but on all input words so far. The different continuations form a tree structure, where the root node is the input word w0 from which the continuations or paths evolve (see Figure 2). We denote by d the depth of the tree, i.e., the number of words in the estimated continuations of the sentence.\nAs the size of the tree grows rather quickly, the number of generated paths is controlled by the beam width k, pruning nodes on each level based on word probabilities on their corresponding paths. The path from w0 to wji is denoted by π(wji ), e.g., in Figure 2, π(w 3 1) = (w 0, w11, w 2 3, w 3 1). The pruning score R(wji ) is defined as the product of the word probabilities on π(wji ):\nR(wji ) = ∏\nw′∈π(wji )\np(w′) . (1)\nOn each level of the tree, nodes other than the k highest scoring ones are pruned out. After the pruning on level j, the level j+1 candidates are obtained using the k remaining words. Figures 2 and 3 show examples of the pruned tree and the corresponding continuations.\nContinuing our previous example, the second set of estimated words following the input word w0 are computed using the estimated words from the level 1, e.g. when feeding to network f the word w14 = “system”, the top candidates returned could be {w29 = “and”, w210 = “that”, w211 = “of”, w212 = “is”}. The third level of generated words are computed using the words from the second level and so forth: w212 = “is”→ {w39 = “also”, w310 = “without”, w311 = “proposed”, w312 = “derived”}.\nThe query expansion is formed from the words remaining in the pruned tree. First, the words are filtered using a standard list of English stop words. The query expansion score of wij is defined as the product of its idf value and its probability defined by the model f :\nscore(wji ) = idf(w j i ) · p(w j i ) . (2)\nThe idf values were computed from the same training data that was used to train the network using the form idf(w) = N Nw\n, whereNw is the number of documents where the word w appears in, and N is the total number of documents. Finally, the nexp words having the highest scores are added to the expanded query."

We envision a situation where the user has to find some relevant background resources about the given topic. The aim is thus to find other documents about the same topic t as the input document. For the proactive queries (Section 3.3), we use n input words and nexp = 10. The Lucene search engine was set to return 10 documents.\nWe use all the documents in the database belonging to the same topic as the test document as the target set Dt.

We take a random document as the query and perform a Lucene search over the rest of the data set to retrieve the highest-scoring document. This is now our target document.

      "heading" : "4.5 Results",
      "text" : "Figure 4 shows the results of the simulations. On the lefthand side, the retrieval precision in the exploratory search task is shown. The right-hand figure shows the fractions of known items found in the known-item search task. First of all, as expected, in both tasks the results improve as the size of the context increases. This was especially anticipated\nfor known-item search, due to how the target document was selected.\nSecond, the results show that the query expansion methods can improve the precision of the proactively retrieved documents on the exploratory search task. The LSTMbased query expansion improves the results when the context is long enough, i.e., when n > 10. The intent model based query expansion, on the other hand, is suited for small context sizes (n < 10). For known-item search, the query expansion methods are not equally beneficial. The intent model again improves the results for small context sizes, but the LSTM-based predictions degrade the results.\nThe simulation results agree rather well with intuition of the query expansion methods. The user intent model based method expands the query with terms that have high tf-idf values in the same documents as the input words. It is conceivable that this is primarily useful when the input context is small, as the expansion can then bring useful additional information to the query. The LSTM-based query expansion, on the other hand, dynamically models the written context and can predict upcoming words. It is unsurprising that this works better when there is enough input context. For exploratory search, the predictions made by the LSTM network are accurate enough to increase the retrieval precision; in known-item search the target is smaller, i.e., a single document, and the predictions are not equally useful."

For this reason we have implemented an experimental user interface intended to be shown in a corner of the screen, displaying the proactive recommendations; see Figure 5. The interface is designed to allow the user to maintain her focus on the current task at hand, while offering peripherallyshown contextual recommendations. Any data source, e.g., the user’s own emails, a database of documents, or any web pages, can be used as information to be proactively retrieved. In Figure 5, the resources displayed are arXiv preprints.\nFor obtaining the current writing context, we have implemented a specific text editor, which transmits the current word surrounding the text cursor at each keypress to the proactive search application; this way the input of n words gradually builds up. Similarly, the context could be deduced from, e.g., the text read in a web browser.\nBy clicking on any of the resources, its contents (i.e., the corresponding arXiv page in the setting of Figure 5) are shown in a regular web browser."

      "heading" : "6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "We have described a method for query expansion to enhance proactive information retrieval. The method is based on predicting the most likely continuations of the current input using an LSTM network.\nThe performed experiments provide evidence that our method is able to proactively produce relevant resources. The query expansion computed using an LSTM network improved retrieval precision in an exploratory search task, when enough context data is available. The results with the method used as comparison, based on user intent modeling using an upper confidence bound algorithm, were partially complementary, improving the results when only limited context is available. This naturally suggests a further study on combining the two query expansion methods. Further experiments with different kinds of datasets and tasks are in any case needed to validate the results.\nIn this work, we concentrated on the writing task. We introduced a simple user interface for showing the proactive search results based on the written context received from a dedicated text editor. The text predictions produced by the LSTM network could also be used to to automatically suggest different continuations for the currently written text, as in the Reactive Keyboard [11], [6], or [14]. Furthermore, user studies where the users are performing real-world tasks need to be carried out.\nFinally, in contrast to many of the existing methods for producing proactive recommendations, the proposed method generalizes the context gathering in the sense that\nthe context data can be extracted from several sources, such as a word processing software, PDF reader, or web browser. The only requirement for the context data is that it has to be in textual form."

The jth document in the database is represented by a feature vector xj ∈ RN where xij is the tf-idf value of the ith word. We denote by X ∈ RN×M the tf-idf matrix of the M documents, where each column of X corresponds to one document feature vector and each row corresponds to a distribution of the words over the documents.\nThe user intent model is estimated using the context formed using n previously written words. Based on this input, a set of word weights are computed by using the LinRel algorithm proposed in [2].\nWe denote the relevance vector of observed words by y ∈ [0, 1]N , where yi = 1 corresponds to having observed the ith word in the input. If the ith word does not occur in the subsequent input words, its relevance value starts decreasing such that yi = n −1 i , where ni is the number of sets of input words since the last occurrence of the ith word. For omitting words having very low relevance values, we use a threshold τ = 0.1: when yi < τ the value of yi is set to zero.\nThe observed values in y, corresponding to the input words so far, are assumed to be formed from the model\ny = Xŵ , (3)\nwhere ŵ ∈ RM is the estimated user intent model describing what documents from the training set are currently estimated to be relevant for the user.\nGiven y and X, the user model ŵ can be obtained as\nŵ = (XTX + µI)−1XT y , (4)\nwhere I is an identity matrix of size M ×M and µ ≥ 0 is a regularization parameter, set to µ = 1.0 in our experiments.\nUsing Eq.

In our method, the current task and the needs of the user are estimated, and the potential next steps are unobtrusively predicted based on the user’s past actions. We focus on the task of writing, in which the user is coalescing previously collected information into a text. Our proactive system automatically recommends the user relevant background information. The proposed system incorporates text input prediction using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We present simulations, which show that the system is able to reach higher precision values in an exploratory search setting compared to both a baseline and a comparison system.",
