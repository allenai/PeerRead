      "text" : "submitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nRecently, research on using NL to support human-robot cooperation (HRC) has received increasing attention in several domains such as robotic daily assistance, robotic health caregiving, intelligent manufacturing, autonomous navigation and robot social accompany. However, a high-level review that can reveal the realization process and the latest methodologies of using NL to facilitate HRC is missing. In this review, a comprehensive summary about the methodology development of natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC) has been made. We first analyzed driving forces for NLC developments. Then, with a temporal realization order, we reviewed three main steps of NLC: human NL understanding, knowledge representation, and knowledge-world mapping. Last, based on our paper review and perspectives, potential research trends in NLC were discussed. Keywords: natural language, human-robot cooperation, NL understanding, robot knowledge representation, knowledge-world mapping\n1. Introduction\nAttracted by the naturalness of natural language (NL) communications among humans, the intelligent robots start to use NL to interact with humans during the cooperation [1]. NL is used with either a spoken or written manner for delivering humans’ cooperation requests to a robot, facilitating an intuitive human-robot cooperation (HRC)[2][3][4] [5]. Natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC) has received increasing attention in human-involved intelligent robotics research over the recent decade. By using NL, human intelligence at high-level task planning and robot physical capability (such as force [6], precision [7] and speed [2]) on low-level task executions are combined to perform an intuitive cooperation [6][8].\nCurrently, typical human-robot communication methods include tactile indications such as contact location [9], force strength [10][11], and visual indications such as body pose [12][13], and motion [14][15] etc. Compared with these methods, using NL to conduct an intuitive NLC has several advantages. First, NL makes HRC natural. For traditional methods mentioned above, humans involved in HRC need to be trained to use certain actions/poses for making themselves understandable [16][17]. While in NLC, even non-expert users without prior training can cooperate with a robot by using human-like communication [18][19]. Second, cooperation requests are described accurately. Traditional methods using actions/poses only provide limited patterns to roughly describe cooperation requests due to information loss in action/pose simplification (such as using markers to simplify actions) [20][21][22][23]. While in NLC, cooperation requests related to action, speed, tool and location are already defined in NL expressions [7][24]. With these expressions, cooperation requests for various task executions are described accurately. Third, NL transfers cooperation requests efficiently. The information-transferring method using actions/poses requires the design of informative patterns for different cooperation requests [20][21]. Existing languages, such as English, Chinese and German, already have standard linguistic structures, which contain abundant informative expressions to serve as patterns [25][26]. NL-based methods do not need to design specific informative patterns for various cooperation requests, making HRC efficient. Lastly, since NL instructions are delivered orally instead of being physically involved, human hands are set free to perform more important executions.\nWith the above advantages, NLC has been widely explored in areas, including daily assistances [27][28], medical caregiving [29][30], manufacturing [8][31], indoor/outdoor navigation [36][37], social accompany [38][39] etc. Typical areas using NLC systems are shown in Fig. 1.\n_______________________________________ *Corresponding author: Tel.:+1-303-384-2343; fax:+1-303-273-3602, email:xlzhang@mines.edu.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\n2. Motivation\nFrom the realization perspective, motivations of NLC research are concluded as research developments in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) and HRC.\n2.1. NLC is motivated by NLP\nNLP automatically analyzes text’s semantic meaning by modeling computational models and extracting linguistic features. Pushed by recent improvements of machine learning technics in classification [40], clustering [41] and feature extraction [42], NLP has been developed from simply syntax-driven processing, which builds syntax representations of sentence structures, to semantically-driven processing, which builds semantic networks for sentence meanings [43].\nStarting in the year 1950, the simplest semantic analysis method, keyword-based understanding method, was designed [44], enabling a naïve word-symbol understanding by identifying single/multiple keywords [45][46], lexical affinities [47][48], and word/affinity occurrences [49][50]. The word-based NLP method separately understood word meanings, and sentence meaning was unknown.\nTo enhance semantic analysis capability of a NLP method, concept-based method was designed to allow sentencemeaning-level understanding of NL expressions. The concept-based method modeled semantic meanings of sentences and paragraphs by exploring embedded concepts, mainly including implicit NL indications [51][52], hierarchical ontologies [53][54], and semantic correlations [55][56]. The concept-based method not only understood explicit facts, such as involvements of action/object/events/persons, but also understood implicit indications, such as action purpose, object usage, event meaning, and human intentions.\nTo practically implement NLP methods in real-world robot-involved situations, a narrative-based method was developed to create a more sophisticated knowledge representation in a decision-making-focused [57], real-worldaware [58] and human-cognition-imitated manner [59][60]. In this method, mechanisms of human reasoning and planning, knowledge-to-world mapping, and logic-based human understanding & learning were focused in NLP process. Supported by this method, knowledge was practically used in NLC, further improving robots’ knowledge scalability and human-robot-cooperation flexibility. The development stages of NLP research are summarized in Fig. 2 [44].\n2.2. NLC is motivated by HRC\nIn an early period (about 1940s’ [61]), humans started to interact with robots by using remote controllers, developing an initial HRC, in which cooperation requirements for action mapping, task goal mapping, and cooperation naturalness/effectiveness were not considered. As tasks became complicated, both the robot and human in HRC were assigned with different roles, such as leader-follower and cooperator-cooperator, to perform different parts of a task with considerations of task goal accomplishments, human-robot communications, robot/human statuses and physical/mental capabilities. Compared with HRI, which focuses on general interactions (detailed HRI reviews are in [62][63]) for physical/mental assistances without task-goal constrains, HRC focuses on specific cooperation for task fulfillment with task-goal constrains, such as task planning and adjusting (detailed HRC reviews are [61][64]). In this paper, we emphasized HRC, specifically exploring state-of-the-art robotic systems using NL to facilitate HRC in various research domains.\nRecently, HRC has been developing: it began largely from a low-cognition-level action research where actions\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nwere designed and selected according to human instructions, grew to a middle-cognition-level interaction research where shallow-level understanding of human motions, activities, tasks and safety concerns was conducted, and is now expanding to a high-cognition-level human-centered engagement research where human’s psychological and cognitive statuses, such as attention, motivation, emotion and user models, are considered to improve HRC effectiveness and naturalness. Increasing human involvements in HRC is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe first stage of HRC development is action-based HRC. It started from motor-control-based action design where a robot followed simple human instructions to adjust its actions [65][66]. To make robot actions natural, a human-like motion style was then adopted in robot action design [67][68]. Though robots’ motion behavior was similar with that of a human, robots’ cooperation performances were still poor due to the limited action-understanding being insufficient to support its adaptations towards users/environments [69][70]. To improve robots’ adaptability, action interpretations were added for a robot in HRC. For example, ‘cup manipulation’ in ‘drinking’ activity meant ‘containing liquid’” [15]. Though the understanding was still limited to an action level, robots’ understanding towards human behaviors in HRC was improved [71].\nThe second stage of HRC development is interaction-based HRC. It started from action-understanding-based\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nmovement imitation [72][73] where a robot was required to learn from human demonstrations, understand human movements and develop its own movements. To improve the understanding of human movements, robots were provided with various informative motion data, such as human action trajectories [74], hand/body poses [75], and biosignals [76]. To further improve robots’ cooperation performance, robots were trained to explore the mutual influence between a human and his/her surrounding environment [77][78].\nThe third stage of HRC development is engagement-based HRC. Individual-level factors, such as individual attentions [79][80], personalities [81][82], emotions [83][84] and safety factors [70][88], were considered by robots in the cooperation. With engagement-based HRC method, robot cognition was further improved by adapting various individuals. This method is widely used in present-day HRC research. Given the urgent needs for intuitive HRC, a natural and effective cooperation manner such as NL-based cooperation has been focused on.\n2.3. Systematic overview of NLC research\nWith cross-disciplinary technique supports, NLC has been developed from low-cognition-level symbol matching control, such as using “yes/no” for controlling robotic execution, to high-cognition-level task understanding, such as “go straight and turn left at the second cross”.\nAs a result of NLC research, a substantial number of projects were launched, including “collaborative research: jointly learning language and affordances” from Cornell University [85], “robots that learn to communicate with humans through natural dialog” from University of Texas at Austin [86], “collaborative research: modeling and verification of language-based interaction” from MIT [87], “language grounding in robotics” in University of Washington [89], “semantic systems” from Lund University [90] etc. NLC research is regularly published in international journals such as IJRR [91], TRO [92], AI [93] and KBS [94], and international conferences such as ICRA [95], IROS [96] and AAAI [97]. The publication trend is shown in Fig. 4, where the increasing significance of using NL to facilitate HRC is reflected by steadily increasing publication numbers.\nCompared with existing review papers about HRC using gesture/pose [98][99], action/motion [100], and tactile [101], a review paper about NLC is lacking. Given the promising potential and increasing attention of NLC, it is necessary to make a summary of state-of-the-art robotic systems in wide-range domains, revealing the current research progress and signposting future NLC research. The organization of this review paper is shown in Fig. 5.\n3. Framework of NLC realization\nThe realization of NLC in HRC is challenging due to technique limitations in environment perceiving, task reasoning, and cooperation acting to support intuitive robot performances. Various methodologies have been developed to realize an intuitive NLC in robotic systems. By tracking knowledge flow, the general process of NLC realization are categorized into three main stages: NL understanding, knowledge representation, and knowledge-world mapping. In each stage, the rationale, realization mechanism, solved problems, advantages and disadvantages of existing methodologies are summarized and compared. In NL understanding, cooperation-related human NL descriptions are analyzed to understand humans’ cooperation requests. In knowledge representation, piecemeal knowledge extracted in the NL understanding stage is represented with an algorithm structure to support robots’\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\ndecision making about task execution planning, human intention prediction, and human need detection. In knowledgeworld mapping, theoretical knowledge in robots’ databases is mapped to practical things and relations, such as action, location, object, and human status, in the real world. Only with success mapping between theoretical knowledge and real-world things can NLC be conducted successfully. The flowchart of a general NLC realization process is shown in Fig. 6.\nFig.5. Organization of this review paper. This review systematically summarized methodologies for using NL to facilitate HRC. It includes four main sections: NLC background in which NLC-research’s motivation is introduced, NLC methodologies in which detailed NLC approaches are summarized, NLC applications, in which typical NLC applications are introduced at a high level, and NLC trends in which the future NLC research directions, are summarized. Among four sections, the methodologies have been comprehensively summarized by following a temporal execution order.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\n4. NL understanding\nNL understanding enables a robot to receive human-assigned tasks, follow human-preferred execution procedures, and understand the surrounding environment, thereby deciding both accuracy and intuitiveness of HRC. The realization process of NL understanding is shown in Fig. 7. To theoretically support human NL instruction understanding in NLC, two types of semantic analysis models were developed: feature-based models and aspect-based models.\n4.1 Models\nIn feature-based models, linguistic features, such as words, Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, word dependencies, word references and sentence syntax structures, were mainly used to analyze the meaning of human NL instructions in NLC, shown in Fig. 8. In aspect-based models, semantic features, such as temporal/spatial relation, object categories, and object functional roles, were mainly used to analyze the meaning of human NL instructions in NLC, shown in Fig. 9. A. Feature-based models\nPredefinition model. The simplest model for NL understanding is the predefinition model, which is also the earliest NL-understanding model for NLC [1]. By identifying targeted keywords [102][103] and phrases [104][105] in human NL, a robot accurately understood symbolic and concise human cooperation requests when these requests were predefined exactly. Then, to disambiguate word meanings, PoS tags for keywords were defined for polysemy situations [106][107], in which one word/phrase could have multiple meanings and one meaning could be expressed by multiple words/expressions. Labeling words by PoS tags improved NL understanding performances, endowing predefinition models with initial semantic analysis capability. To model meanings of NL expressions in NLC, structural correlations, including keyword dependency, PoS dependency, and keyword meaning similarities, were summarized [32][108]. By using these structural correlations, the meaning of a whole sentence could be modeled for understanding human’s cooperation requests. Predefinition models had good performances (success feature understanding rate 83%~100% [109]) in trained situations, whereas humans’ NL expressions were defined in robots’ knowledge. However, this type of models had a poor NL-understanding performance in untrained situations where NL expressions were not defined, or in similar situations where NL expressions were partially defined [102]. With a predefinition manner, potentially-encountered expressions were listed out explicitly. Only when NL expressions were exactly matching expressions in robots’ databases could human NL requests be identified. The word-based meaning modeling is at a shallow level, merely suitable for static situations.\nGrammar model. To disambiguate the meanings of human NL requests and further improve robots’ adaptability towards various NL expressions in NLC, feature-based grammar models were developed by summarizing general linguistic rules from humans’ NL requests. Some feature-based grammars explored execution logics. For example,\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nverb word and noun word were combined to describe a type of actions such as V(go) + NN(Hallway) and V(grasp) + NN(cup) [103][108][114][115]. Some feature-based grammars explored temporal relations, such as the if-then relation “if door open, then turn right” and the step1-step2 relation “go -- grasp” [116][117][118]. Some feature-based grammars explored spatial relations, such as the IN relation “cup IN room” and the CloseTo relation “cup CloseTo plate” [37][119][120]. The rationale of feature-based grammar method is that sentences with a similar meaning have similar syntax structures. By evaluating the syntax structure similarity, similarity of NL meanings were detected.\nInterpretation model. To understand abstract and implicit NL requests, interpretation models were developed. One typical interpretation model is a probabilistic interpretation model in which informative features such as keywords were implicitly correlated with probability likelihood. Typical works are [116][121][122][123]. Needed information, such as “beverage is likely to be juice”, was recommended for understanding abstract requests, such as “put beverage in the fridge”, according to the correlation likelihood [123]. Probabilistic model recommends human-unmentioned knowledge for a robot according to the probabilistic correlations. With this probabilistic interpretation model, the uncertainty in NL expressions was modeled, disambiguating cooperation requests and improving robots’ adaptation towards different human users with various NL expressions. Another typical interpretation model is a commonsense interpretation model. Its rationale is that general commonsense knowledge accumulated from daily life experiences could be used in specific situations for specifying abstract/ambiguous human NL requests. Compared with probabilistic interpretation models, which used objective probabilistic correlations, the commonsense interpretation model uses subjective empirical interpretation. Typical usages include the following types. By defining sensor value ranges for ambiguous descriptions, such as “slowly, frequently, heavy”, the commonsense interpretation model made quantitative interpretations of ambiguous execution requests in NLC [118][124]. By integrating key aspects, such as precondition, action sequence, human preference, tool usages and location information, the commonsense interpretation model made machine-executable task plans based on human-described high-level abstract task plans [7] [37][107][115][125]. By using discrete fuzzy statuses to map continuous sensor data, unlimited objective sensor values were ‘translated’ into limited subjective NL expressions such as “close to the robot, in the kitchen” [112][126]. By combining human factors such as ‘human’s visual scope’ with linguistic features such as a keyword “wrench”, the commonsense interpretation model became context-sensitive, making a robot understand human NL requests such as “ deliver him a wrench” from the human perspective “human desired wrench is actually the human-visible wrench”\nFig.8. Typical feature-based models for NL request understanding. (a) [102] and (b) [110] are predefined models. In (a), the predefined keywords such as “objects: book pen, animate: person, robot” were detected from a user’s NL instructions, assisting a Jijo-2 office robot with executing tasks such as “find a person, delivery a book”. In (b), the robotic arm’s motion was controlled by predefined vowels in human speech. (c) [111] is a grammar model, in which object manipulation methods are defined as linguistic structures such as “find(cup), grasp(milkbox), …”. (d) [112] (e) [113] and (f) [112] are interpretation models, in which a command for a robot arm is interpreted into execution parameters. For example, in (d), ambiguous NL expressions such as “very little” was interpreted as a very small distance value. In (e), NL expression such as “OpenLeft” was interpreted as specific parameter “open left hand for 1 DOF.”\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\n[111][117][127][128]. The advantages are that robots’ cognition levels are improved by means of knowledge scaling up and knowledge mutual compensation. With this interpretation model, a robot can explore unstructured environments by exploiting its learned and existing knowledge. B. Aspect-based models\nSingle-modality model. Single-modality models are similar with feature-based models in that both of them have predefinition models, grammar models, and interpretation models. One difference is that feature-based models merely use linguistic features while single-modality models use both linguistic features and semantic aspects features. The rationale of single-modality models is that analyze meanings of NL requests by exploring semantic correlations, such as “goal-substep, substep-substep, substep-toolUsage …”, among semantic aspects, such as the logic order, sub-steps, tool usages, during task executions. Typical semantic aspects include object categories such as “box, ball” [127], task-\nrelated facts such as execution order “command → global constraint → …” plan statuses such as “planned, failed,\nsuspended, cancelled, complete” [129], human factors such as “action type, current location, voice amplitude, head motion” [130][131], environment context such as “object is at behand, elevators are in right ” [132][133] etc. Manners for using semantic aspects in single-modality models mainly include first-order logic, conditional/joint probability distribution, and feature space classification. Based on an aspect-based model, either explicit correlations, such as temporal/spatial correlation, or implicit correlations, such as human/robot/task statuses, were modeled. Typical problems solved by single modality models include: human-desired tool identification using semantic aspects such as color, shape and weight [131][134], human visual perspective understanding by using cognition aspects such as human preference, human physical ability and human needs [135][136], task motivation understanding using executionrelated key factors such as action sequences, tool functions, locations [7][132] etc. The aspect-based model is generally better than the feature-based method in understanding human NL requests in NLC [122]. This is because the aspectbased model is abstract with a better summary of essential rules behind various human NL expressions, adapting a wide range of NL expression manners and contents to avoid the cold-start phenomenon (it is an untrained situation [142]). Moreover, aspect-based models are more similar to human cognitive process. For example, semantic aspects “action-effect” and “object-function” were human’s cognitive perspectives for understanding task cooperation [15].\nFig.9. Typical aspect-based models for NL request understanding. (a) [115], (b) [7], (c) [137] and (d) [123] are typical single-modality aspectbased models. In (a), only physical-property aspects such as “color: yellow, size: short, ..” were involved in NL requests to describe a humandesired object. In (b), only execution parameters such as “action:rub, wipe, sweep. objective: debris, junk, saqdust. location: hole, point, corner.” were considered to describe a task-execution process. In (c), spatial relations such as “through, down, to, ..” were detected in human NL instructions, assisting an robot with its navigation. (e) [138], (f) [139], (g) [140], and (h) [141] are multi-modality aspect-based models. In (e), robot memory, real-world states and human NL instructions were integrated to instruct a robotic with plan executions. In (f), the face/gaze tracking, hand poses, object identities, and human NL instructions were integrated to assign object manipulation tasks to a robot. In (g), the tactile sensing, and human NL instructions were integrated to assist a robot with object delivery. In (h), body poses and human NL instructions were integrated together to assist a robot with its environment adaptation.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nIn single-modality models, all information used for understanding human NL requests is extracted from human NL requests themselves.\nMulti-modality model. The single-modality model effectively captures informative patterns in NL expressions to understand humans’ cooperation requests. However, human requests are usually situated such that humans’ NL requests are closely correlated with situation-related information such as task execution progress, environmental conditions, and human status. An accurate understanding of human NL requests needs the integration of multimodality semantic features instead of merely exploring information from human NL expressions. A multi-modality model was designed to integrate different modality information together for comprehensive meaning modeling. The rationale of multi-modality models is that a human is considered to be dependent from the surrounding environment and better understanding comes from environment exploration. With multi-modality models, information from multimodalities was aligned to establish semantic corrections. From the perspective of knowledge origination, multimodality models are categorized into models using human-related features and models using environment/robotrelated features. For multi-modality models using human-related features to understand human NL expressions, typical features beyond linguistic features considered in single-modality models also include facial expressions (joy, sad etc.) [143], individual identity [139], touch events [140], hand poses [144], and head orientations [75]. Supported by rich information from multi-modality features, typical solved problems include complex-instruction understanding [141], human-like HRC [75], social behavior interpretation [126] etc. For multi-modality models using environment/robot-related features to understand human NL requests in NLC, including linguistic features considered in single-modality models, typical features also include temporal dependencies among speech-head orientation, hand gesture domains [75], spatial relations among human, robot, and object [141], visual-auditory-combined indications [145], knowledge/sensorimotor-combined intention predictions [138], etc. Supported by rich information from these features, typical solved problems include real-time communication, context-sensitive cooperation (sensor-speech alignment), machine-executable task plan generation, implicit human request interpretation, etc. Typical algorithms used for constructing multi-modality models include hidden Markov model (HMM) for modeling hidden probabilistic relations among semantic aspects [145][146], Bayesian Network for modeling probabilistic transitions among taskexecution steps [147][148], first-order logic for modeling semantic constraints among semantic aspects [130][149] etc. These algorithms integrate different modalities with appropriate contribution distributions and extract contributive feature patterns among modalities. Multi-modality models have three potential advantages in understanding human NL expressions: (1) By exploring multi-modality-information sources, rich information can be extracted for an accurate NL understanding. (2) Information in one modality can be compensated by information learned from other modalities for better NL disambiguation. (3) Consistency of multi-modality information enables mutual confirmations among knowledge from multiple modalities. A reliable NL request understanding could be conducted. Supported by these advantages, multi-modality models have the potential to understand complex cooperation plans and various users, and to perform practical NL understandings in real-world NLC situations.\n4.2. Open Problems A. Feature-based method\nPredefinition model. In practical situations, a human partner usually uses various expressions to express the same meaning or express various meanings using the same expression. Understanding these varieties beyonds the capability of a predefined model in analyzing semantic meanings of human NL requests.\nGrammar model. Although models’ adaptability towards NL understanding has been enhanced, the drawback is that feature correlations needed for understanding have been exhaustively listed. It is difficult to summarize likelyencountered grammar rules. This feature-based grammar method could only deal with trained NL expressions, and is incapable of dealing with untrained NL expressions. Considering that usages of words and sentence structures in NL expressions varies according to different partners/tasks/environments/robots, NL-understanding-models’ adaptability is still limited and insufficient to support natural communications in NLC. Moreover, human NL requests are usually abstract and often some detailed NLC-related information, such as logic relations and execution-specific location/tool/action, is ignored at the keyword level. Understanding word meaning is insufficient to understand sentence meanings in NLC.\nInterpretation model. One drawback of interpretation models is that all interpretations need to be manually defined, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, even though the interpretation model could interpret abstract linguistic features into detailed specific information, it still suffers the feature ambiguity problem. This issue arises due to interpreted information being likely to be mapped onto wrong abstract features, decreasing the accuracy\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nand reliability of NL understanding and further decreasing robots’ user/environment adaptability. B. Aspect-based method\nSingle-modality model. Even though single modality models understand NL requests in a semantic-analysis manner, performances of these single modality models are still limited when human NL expressions are relatively complex in either description manner or content. The main reason is that human NL requests are correlated with practical situations in the real world, and consist of information about tasks’ working status, human/robot statuses and environment conditions. Information from a single NL modality is insufficient to support the meaning understanding towards human NL requests during NLC.\nMulti-modality model. Even though multi-modality models are capable of comprehensively understanding human NL requests by considering practical situations, challenges still exist within this model. First, it is difficult to combine different types of modalities such as motion, speech, and visual cues with an appropriate manner to reveal practical contribution distributions for different modalities. Second, it is difficult to extract contributive features for describing both distinctive and common aspects of one modality in understanding NL requests. Third, the overfitting problem still exists when using multi-modality information to understand NL requests. NL understandings based on different modalities could be mutually conflicting, thereby preventing the practical implementation of multi-modality models.\n5. Knowledge representation\nKnowledge representation organizes previously learned knowledge with specific algorithm structures, providing a theoretical foundation for formulizing robots’ decision making mechanisms. The realization process for knowledge representation is shown in Fig. 10. In this representation, correlations among NLC-related knowledge, such as execution steps, step transitions, and actions/tools/locations involvements, and their temporal/spatial/logic relations are defined. From the perspective of algorithm structures, knowledge representation models have three main types: probabilistic model, logic model and cognitive model.\n5.1 Models\nThe probabilistic model explored probabilistic dependencies among NLC-task-related knowledge, focusing on cooperation accuracy, shown in Fig. 11. The logic model explored logic constraints among NLC-related knowledge, focusing on cooperation success, shown in Fig. 12. The cognitive model explored the motivations among NLC-taskrelated knowledge, focusing on cooperation reasonability, shown in Fig. 13. A. Probabilistic model\nIn regards to probabilistic relations, probabilistic models for knowledge representations are categorized into a generative model, which is based on generative algorithms, such as Naïve Bayesian network (BN) [150], Hidden Markov model (HMM) [151], and Markov Random Field (MRF) [152], and a discriminative model, which is based on discriminative algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) [153] and Conditional Random Field (CRF) [154]. Given that generative algorithms are constructed by joint probabilistic relations, generative models are good at exploring semantic associations among knowledge inside one task; given that discriminative algorithms are constructed by conditional probabilistic relations, discriminative models are good at exploring the mutual distinctiveness among knowledge crossing various tasks. Therefore, the generative model is typically used to represent one task, while the discriminative model is typically used to distinguish multiple tasks.\n(i). Generative models Joint-probabilistic BN. Joint-probability Bayesian Network (BN) is the simplest generative model involved in NLC. By using a single joint probability p(x, y), the probabilistic association p of a human’s cooperation request y, such as “move”, and one execution parameter x, such as object “ball”, was made [155]. The rationale of jointprobabilistic BN is that observations of entity co-occurrences in practical situations are consistent with knowledge of entity semantic correlations in theoretical representations. Based on this observation-knowledge-consistency assumption, knowledge representations are directly extracted from large amounts of sensor-based observations. Typical joint-probability associations in NLC include activity-object associations such as drink-cup [111], activityenvironment associations such as drink-hotDay [77], and action-sensor associations such as pickup-0.1m/s [156]. In knowledge representation, a single joint-probabilistic BN association is used as independent evidence to describe one semantic aspect of a task. For using multiple joint-probabilistic associations ∏ \uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56)\uD835\uDC56 , the semantic aspects of NLC task are collected from various NL descriptions and sensor data patterns. Typical methods using multiple jointprobability associations include Viterbi algorithm [156], Naïve Bayesian (NB) algorithm [77] and Markov Random Field (MRF) [78]. With these algorithms, the most complete representation described in human’s requests is selected\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nas a human-desired cooperation task. The rationale of multi-joint-probabilistic BN models is that associations describe semantic aspects of a cooperation task. With multi-joint-probabilistic BN models, solved problems include: modeling tasks’ meaning distributions on linguistic features such as NL keywords and expression patterns [78][157]; aligning multi-view sensor data such as speech meaning, task execution statuses, and robot/human motion statuses [115][158];\nTable. 1.

For a summary of the problem-solving manners, the generative model can use large amounts of data to build accurate task representations by integrating relatively-complete semantic aspects for one NLC task. One common character of generative models such as naïve Bayesian (NB) is that dependencies among task features are simplified to be fully or partially independent [77]. In practical situations, when a set of observations are made, observed evidences such as speech/object/context/action involvements in the cooperation are actually not mutually-independent [163]. As for task representation, this simplification brings both negative effects, such as undermining the representation accuracy, and positive effects, such as preventing overfitting problems in taskrepresentation process. It is also worth mentioning that, different from other multi-joint-probabilistic BN models, MRF can model the circle-type association in which repeated and cyclic occurrences are modeled within [164]. The unique function of a MRF is that mutual correlations among task’s semantic aspects could be described. The common problem of multi-joint-probabilistic BN models is that temporal associations are ignored. Knowledge representations by multi-joint-probabilistic BN models are incapable of revealing temporal associations among tasks’ semantic aspects, limiting the implementations of real-time NLC.\nDynamic BN. Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) explores temporal correlations by exploring sequential dependencies propagation p(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61|\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−1) among NLC-related features [165]. Given that the final format of DBN is the joint probabilistic form p(y, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−1, ..), DBN is still a joint-probabilistic model. A widely-used DBN algorithm in NLC is hidden Markov mode (HMM) algorithm [166], which uses a Markov chain assumption to explore the hidden influence of previous task-related features on the current NLC status. The rationale of HMM in NLC is that humandesired cooperation, such as going to a position, grasping a tool, and lifting a robot hand, are decided by the previous NLC working statuses (\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−1) and the current statuses \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61. These statuses include environmental working conditions, task execution progress, human NL instructions, human/robot statuses etc. HMM uses both observation probabilities (absolute probability p(x)) and transitions abilities (conditional probability p(Y/X)) for modeling associations P(x, y) among NLC-related knowledge [166][167]. With a simple BN propagation, associations among NLC-related knowledge could be modeled efficiently. The Markov assumption in HMM efficiently models dynamic relations by considering previous statuses (\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−2, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−3, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC61−4, …) as non-informative features and then ignoring all of them in task representation. With HMM models, solved problems mainly include real-time human NL request understanding [168][169], dynamical human status identification [167][170], accurate gesture recognition by simultaneously fusing multi-view data such as NL instruction, shoulder coordinates, shoulders-elbows’ 3D angle data, and hand poses [166][171] etc. Limited by Markov assumptions, HMM is only capable of modeling shallow-level hidden correlations among NLC-related knowledge. Moreover, given that hidden statuses need to be explored for HMM modeling, a large\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\namount of training data is needed, limiting HMM implementations in unstructured scenarios with limited training data availability.\n(ii). Discriminative models Instead of representing tasks in generative models, a discriminative model was designed to distinguish a task from others. In a generative model, various semantic aspects are collected from a large amount of training data for describing a relatively-complete task representation. In a discriminative model, only the most distinctive aspects are collected from a relatively-small amount of data for identifying a task [172].\nConditional-probabilistic BN. Conditional-probabilistic BN is the simplest discriminative model with a single conditional relation p(y/x), modeling a probabilistic dependency between a human-desired cooperation task y and an evidence x such as a keyword and an action type [173]. Different from direct observations in joint-probabilistic BN, the conditional dependencies between human NL requests and a piece of evidence could not be directly observed due to the conditional dependency being implicit. Typical procedures for exploring conditional dependencies are the following: first, intentionally assume implicit dependencies among a human-requested task and its potential evidences; then, conduct learning to compute dependency strengths; last, keep influential dependencies by filtering out dependences with weak strengths [174][175]. The rationale of conditional-probabilistic BN models is that the evidence which frequently appears inside a task representation has a conditional dependency with the task. Typical solved problems include semantic meaning disambiguation such as object-feature dependencies [176], word-object mapping [7], word-sensor mapping [177], word-to-interpretation modeling [178] etc. A conditional-probabilistic dependency is considered as a knowledge component for constructing complicated discriminative models such as conditional random field (CRF). CRF is good at modeling semantic meaning propagation, in which semantic meanings of human NL instructions could be modeled by considering the likely task-related temporal dependencies. Different from HMM, in which only independent features and non-circle dependences are modeled, CRF is capable of modeling dependent\nFig.11. Typical probabilistic models for knowledge representation. (a) [167] and (b) [155] are generative models. (a) is a HMM model, in which NLC task’s potential execution sequences are modeled by hidden Markov statuses. (b) is a naïve Bayesian model, in which observations “object size, object shape” and their conditional correlations such as “size-big, shape-ball, ..” are combined to form a joint-probability correlations such as “object-size-shape, ….”. (c) [174] and (d) [136] are discriminative models. (c) is a condition random filed model (CRF), in which task-related features such as “path length, landmarks, …” are involved to distinguish a navigation path from other paths. (d) is a SVM model, in which the most distinguishable pieces of evidence, such as “social affordance ‘push-left’, and voice behavior ‘pass me’”, have been considered to identify human desired tasks such as “Pass/Take”.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nfeatures with circle dependencies [164]. Moreover, compared with HMM, which is modeling a task by using implicit hidden statuses, CRF models a task by using explicit feature dependencies.\nSupport vector machine (SVM). SVM is a typical discriminative model because SVM merely uses distinctive\nfeatures to distinguish NLC task representation from others, even when there are numerous features available. With this rationale, SVM is used to fuse the sensor data from multiple modalities. Typical solved problems include accurate intention inferences by combining motion/vision/speech information [179][180], robotic task executions using motion/speech commands [181][182], human NL request disambiguation [171][183] etc. B. Logic model\nTo model subsequent relations among task procedures, logic models for task knowledge representation were designed. The existing logic models mainly include an ontology model and first-order logic model. Ontology models focus on using hierarchical ontology structures to interpret a simple action/status, while the first-order-logic model focuses on using a logic workflow to describe a complex execution-procedure.\nOntology model. An ontology model uses a hierarchical semantic structure to describe inner correlations among NLC-related knowledge (a sample structure is shown in Fig. x) [27]. The rationale of an ontology model is that a detailed execution step could be expressed by a multi-layer ontology tree, inside which necessary execution parameters, such as action sequences, tool usages and locations, are defined. The benefit of the ontology-tree task representation is that the exchangeability of included procedures is increased by replacing unavailable ontology execution parameters with the available same-type-ontology parameters. The environment adaptability of a taskrepresentation model is improved [15][27]. Typical solved problems include intuitive object usages by defining object categories and replacing the missing object by the same-semantic-category object [15][184], complex executionprocedure modeling by integrating crucial execution components, such as task execution procedures, objects and actions, and detailed execution parameters, such as speed, location, action and tool usage, into an ontology tree [185][186], intelligent robot control in which a control goal was decomposed into sub-strategies such as {notActive, run, hold done, …} and each strategy was endowed with ontologies constrains such as robot motion statuses, robot physical capabilities, and human safety considerations [112][187], human NL command disambiguation by looking up ambiguous words in an ontology tree to get extra semantic evidences, such as “Cup-UnitOfVolume, action: put, teaspoon-UnitOfVolume” [27][78], intuitive robot conceptualized programming, such as telling the robot to focus on\nobjects that are within range (perceived object ∪ imagined object ∪ mathematical object), adapting dynamic\nenvironments in task execution by defining detailed replaceable parameters for execution components, such as “manipulation types, handing skills, …”, in an ontology tree [22][109], imitating human execution manners by defining both execution procedures and sensor parameters such as “location, speed, velocity, …” in an ontology tree [188][189], autonomous manufacturing by defining abstract manufacturing plans such as assembly plan { Task/skill/process—assemblyTask/GenericTask/WoodworkingTask/weldingTask—assemblePartsTas/pickTask} in an ontology tree to simplify user involvements [190][191], environment perceiving by using ontology interpretations on the 3D point cloud [192][193] etc. Compared with probabilistic models, the relative advantage of using an ontology model is that task execution procedures could be flexibly modeled, increasing the robot task execution robustness in various environments.\nFirst-order logic model. In NLC, a first-order-logic model describes execution procedures as first-order logic\nformulas, such as “in possible worlds a kitchen is a region (∀w∀x(kitchen(w,x) → region(w,x)))” [194]. An ontology\nFig.12. Typical logic models for knowledge representation. (a) [185] is an ontology model, in which an assembly task “bearing assembly” is decomposed into several layers of sub-steps such as “bearing + pipe, bearing 2 + tree, ….”. (b) [33] is a first-order-logic model, in which NLC tasks such as “finding a cup” is decomposed into different logic constraints such as “cupAction + graspingPose → detectCup success”. (c) [114] is also an first-order-logic model, in which logic relations such as “move=(grasp, place), …” is defined to control robots’ motion in NLC.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nmodel is describing a single time frame, in which necessary information for one robot execution has been detailed in an ontology manner, enabling a flexible robot execution in NLC. A first-order logic model meanwhile describes logic relations among multiple time frames, in which necessary sequences for robot execution have been detailed in a firstorder logic manner, enabling a reasonable robot execution in NLC. The rationale of first-order logic models in NLC is that an NLC task is decomposed into sequential logic formulas by satisfying which specific NLC task could be accomplished. In a first-order logic model, logics are equally important without contribution differences towards execution success. Logic relations in first-order-logic models, including tool usages, action sequences, locations etc., are defined in the structure. Typical solved problems include autonomous robot navigation by using logic navigation sequences, such as going to a location “hallway” then going to a new location “rest room” [147][149][194], environment uncertainty modeling by summarizing potential executions such as “ground atoms (boolean random variables) eats(Dominik, Cereals), uses(Dominik, Bowl), eats(Michael, Cereals) and uses(Michael, Bowl)” [195], robot action control by defining action-usage logics such as “move (grasp piece(location, grip), place piece(location, ungrip))” [147][196][197][198], autonomous failure analysis by looking up first-order logic representations to detect the missing knowledge such as “tool brush, action: sweep” [7][198], and NL-based robot programming by using the grammar language such as point(object, arm-side), lookat(object), and rotate(rot-dir, arm-side) [130]. The drawback of first-order logic models in modeling NLC tasks is that logic relations defined in the model are hard constraints. If one logic formula was violated in practical execution processes, the whole logic structure would be inapplicable and the task execution would fail. This drawback limits model’s implementation scopes and reduces robots’ environment adaptability. Moreover, hard constraints were defined indifferently, ignoring the relative importance of executions. The execution flexibility is undermined due to critical executions not being focused and trivial executions not being ignored when the NLC plan modifications are necessary. C. Cognitive model\nHuman cognition in task planning is reflected in flexibly-changing execution plans (different procedures), adjusting execution orders (same procedures, different orders), removing some less-important execution procedures or adding more critical executions procedures (similar procedures, similar orders). According to the logic influence definition manner, cognitive models could be categorized into two main types: fuzzy-logic model and weighted logic model.\nFuzzy-logic model. A fuzzy-logic model represents a human-desired NLC task by fully or partially fuzzy statuses, which are consistent with ambiguous descriptions in human NL requests. The rationale of a fuzzy-logic model is that human NL requests in NLC are information-rich and are meanwhile ambiguous and abstract, thereby requiring detailed interpretation manners such as fuzzy logic to decode embedded NLC-related information for a practical and intuitive robot execution. Typical solved problems include modeling motion statuses such as “quick, slow” by interpreting sensor data [199], sophisticated robot-manipulation control by interpreting NL control commands, such as “move little right, bend your elbow little”, into fuzzy execution value range [112], emotion modeling by classifying\nFig.13. Typical cognitive models for knowledge representation. (a) [200] is a fuzzy emotion model, in which human’s motion in NL expressions have been defined as fuzzy statuses “very low happy, vey high happy, …”, assisting HRC. (b) [191] is a weighted logic model, in which human’s cognitive process in decision making is simulated by logics with different influence weights, based on which important logics with larger weights could be emphasized and trivial logics with smaller weights could be ignored. With this weighted-logic manner, the flexible cooperation between a human and a robot could be conducted.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nemotion statuses such as happy {very low, low, medium, high, very high} in a fuzzy manner [200] etc. The advantage of using fuzzy logic is that the sensor data from perceiving systems for working status monitory, NL analysis, and environment condition assessment is continuous and unlimited. It is necessary to interpret these unlimited and objective data values into limited and subjective situation statuses, which are consistent with human perspective and easily understood by a robot. The major drawback of using the fuzzy-logic model in representing NLC cooperation task is that the fuzzy logic model only focuses on modeling status components inside one execution step and ignores mutual correlations among the steps.\nWeighted-logic model. A weighted-logic model represents human’s cognitive processes by logic formulas as well as their weighted importance. A typical weighted-logic model is Markov logic network (MLN) model. MLN represents NLC task in a way such as “0.3Drill(\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC601) ^ 0.3TransitionFeasible(\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC601,\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC602) ^ 0.3Clean(\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC602) ⇒ 0.9Task(\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC601,\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC602)” [7], imitating human cognition process in task planning. In this model, single execution steps and step transitions were defined by logic clauses, which could be grounded into different logic formulas by substituting real-world conditions. With this cognitive model, a flexible execution plan could be generated by omitting weak-contributed and non-contributed logic formulas and involving strong-contributed logic formulas. Different from hard constraints in first-order logic models, constraints (logic clauses) in MLN are soft. These soft constraints mean when a human’s cooperation requests are partially obeyed by a robot, the task could still be successfully executed. Typical solved problems include using MLN to generate a flexible and intuitive machine-executable plan from human NL instructions for autonomous industrial task execution [191], autonomous task executions in uncertain environments by using MLN to meet constraints from both robots’ knowledge availability and real-world’s knowledge requirements [195][201] etc.\nThe advantage of using weighted-logic models in NLC is that a weighted-logic method is relatively similar to a human’s cognitive process in flexible plan generation. It helps a robot with execution in unfamiliar situations by modifying/replacing execution plans and parameters such as tool/action usages, improving robots’ cognition levels and enhancing its environment adaptability. The major drawback is that MLN is still different from human cognitive processes to consider logic conditions at a deep level to enable plan modification, new plan making and failure analysis. Logic parameters for analyzing real-world conditions are still insufficient to imitate logic relations in human mind, thereby limiting robots’ performances in adapting users and environments.\n5.2. Open Problems\nThese knowledge representation models are effective in many scenarios. However, they are still suffering from their unique shortcomings, limiting implementation scopes and effectiveness of NLC. First, from the perspective of cognition level, probabilistic is close in nature to direct human activity observations and can effectively extract meaningful features form human NL requests; however, the model lacks explorations of indirect human cognitive processes in NLC, limiting the naturalness in robotic executions. Second, the logic model has a higher cognition level compared with probabilistic models due to hierarchical interpretation supporting relatively intuitive task execution mechanisms. The logic model is, however, inflexible and incapable of simulating human’s intuitive planning in realworld environments. Third, the cognitive model is the closest to human cognitive process in simulating flexible decision making process. Task execution is decomposed into cognitive steps with both weighted importance, internal correlations, and corresponding semantic interpretations. The plan flexibility largely increases robots’ adaptability towards various users and environments. Though the human cognitive process is simulated with cognitive models, cognitive models are still suffering from two types of shortcomings. One shortcoming is that cognitive process simulation is still not cognitive process because the fundamental theory of cognitive process modeling is lacking, being insufficient to support a human-like task execution process [195]. The second problem is the difficulties associated with learning cognitive processes for current data collection and algorithm design. Different individuals have difference cognitive process, thus making it difficult to evaluate the reasonability of learned cognitive models [202].\n6. Knowledge-world mapping\nKnowledge-world mapping methods enable a robot to implement the learned knowledge representation into realworld NLC cooperation scenarios. The realization process of knowledge-world mapping is shown in Fig. 14. In considering the implementation process, knowledge-world mapping methods include two main types: theoretical knowledge grounding (Fig. 15) and knowledge gap filling (Fig. 16). In theoretical knowledge grounding, the methods project learned knowledge items, such as objects and spatial/temporal/logic relations, into corresponding\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nobjects/relations in real-world scenarios. In gap filling, methods detect both the missing knowledge, which is needed in real-world situations but hasn’t been covered by theoretical knowledge representations, and the real-worldinconsistent knowledge, which is provided by a human but could not find corresponding things in practical real-world scenario.\n6.1 Models A. Theoretical knowledge grounding\nFrom the perspective of information content, theoretical knowledge grounding methods are categorized into three\nTable. 2.

Direct symbol mapping methods take both knowledge items, such as objects, actions and locations in a theoretical knowledge database, and practical things, such as a physical object/action/location in realworld scenarios as symbols. By associating corresponding symbols in both the database and in the real world, theoretical knowledge is successfully implemented in practical NLC situations. The rationale of a direct symbol mapping method is that establishments of thing-item correlations enable a robot to know what and how to use knowledge in NLC, with the assumption that real-world things have been completely defined as knowledge items in the robots’ database. Typical solved problems mainly include word-action associations such as word “pick” – action “Pick” [203][204], direction instruction-motion behavior correlations such as word “left-turning” – motion behavior “LEFT-TURNING” [19][137], word-object/building/person/location mappings such as “person-Person, trashcanTRASHCAN, hallway-HALLWAY” [181][205] etc. The benefit of using direct symbol mapping methods is that basic knowledge items are directly mapped into the world, constructing fundamental robot knowledge to perform cooperation in a relatively static and simple NLC situation. The main limitation is that the method cannot deal with complex situations where complex relation mapping is needed.\nGeneral property mapping. Different from the direct symbol mapping method, which has an element-mapping manner, the general property mapping method has a structural mapping manner in which a knowledge item is defined with several properties such as visual properties “object color/shape”, motion properties “action speed” and execution properties “tool usage, location” etc. The rationale is that a knowledge item can be successfully grounded into the real world by mapping its properties. Different from the ontology representation where the knowledge items are in a robot knowledge database, in the property mapping model, only top-level knowledge items are in robots’ knowledge database while lower-level detailed properties are in the real world. Typical solved problems include: indoor routine identifying by using landmark locations such as “kitchen, lobby” [206]; object searching by using visual properties such as object color, size and shape [207]; motion execution such as “pick up the tire pallet” by defining action sequence “drive – insert – raise – drive – set” [178]; NLC scene understanding such as “lounge, lab, conference room” by checking spatial-semantic distributions of landmarks such as “hallway, gym, …” [208] etc. The advantage of using property mapping methods is that knowledge could be mapped into the real world in a flexible manner, in which only parts of properties need to be mapped for grounding a theoretical item into a real-world thing. This manner could improve robots’ adaptability towards users and environments. The limitation is that these property mapping methods still use predefinitions to give a robot knowledge, reducing the intuitiveness of HRC.\nSpecific status interpretation. Specific status interpretation method interprets a knowledge item in robots’\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\ndatabase into an information-rich, parameter-specific, and sensor-measurable thing in the real world. The rationale of the specific status interpretation method is that use the general commonsense accumulated in general scenarios to specify the ambiguous and abstract NL requests in specific scenarios in the real world. With this rationale, solved problems mainly include qualitative motion interpretations such as “slowly – 0.1 m/s, far – distance larger than 1 m” [124][209], quantitative spatial relation interpretations such as “object 1 is at the left of an object b” for two objects [37][210], and semantic interpretations such as goal “drill” is interpreted as “drill (action: put down, drill, lift; precondition: no hole existing; requirements: slowly; tool: driller; … )” [191][211] etc. The advantage of using the specific status interpretation method is that with large amounts of general commonsense, human-requested cooperation could be intuitively decomposed into machine-executable sub-goals, increasing robots’ capability in dealing with task complexity and user/environment variety. Human NL instructions in NLC are usually ambiguous and abstract, making instructions non-executable for a robot. With the specific status interpretation, a robot can execute the cooperation even when some critical task-execution-related information such as a key step and a tool involvement is missing. The disadvantage is that commonsense knowledge is difficult to learn, and difficult to decide when and how to use at the proper time in the proper way. B. Knowledge gap filling\nA theoretical-knowledge representation defines an ideal real-world situation. Given unpredicted aspects in a practical situation, even if all defined knowledge has been accurately mapped into the real-world, it is still challenging to ensure the success of NLC by providing all knowledge needed in a practical situation. Especially in real-world situations, human users and environment conditions vary, causing the occurrences of knowledge gaps, which are knowledge required by real-world situations but are missing from robots’ knowledge database. To ensure the success of robot executions, it is crucial to fill in these knowledge gaps. There are three main types of knowledge gaps: 1). Environment gaps, which are constraints such as tool availability and space/location limitations imposed by unfamiliar environments [212][213], 2). Robot gaps, which are constraints such as robot physical structure strength, capable actions and operation precision [17][212][214], and 3) user gaps, which are missing information caused by abstract/ambiguous/incomplete human NL instructions [8][135]. Filling up these knowledge gaps enhances robot capability in adapting dynamic environments and various tasks/users. Knowledge gap filling is challenging in that it is difficult to make a robot aware of its knowledge shortage in specific situations, and it is difficult to make a robot understand how missing knowledge should be compensated for in successful task executions.\nGap detection methods mainly include the following: 1) hierarchical knowledge structure checking, which detects knowledge gaps by checking real-world-available knowledge from top-level goals to low-level NLC execution\nFig.15. Typical methods for theoretical knowledge grounding. (a) [16] is a direct symbol mapping method, by which predefined motion behaviors such as “avoiding, bowing, carring, ..” are directly associated with their corresponding symbolic words. (b) [206] is a general property mapping method, by which special features such as “kitchen location, lab locations, …” are considered to identify human-desired paths.(c) [37] is an interpretation mapping method, by which a navigation task is specifically interpreted by real-world conditions such as “action: observe. namedobj:robot/building, … mode:quickly. … ”.\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nparameters defined in a hierarchical knowledge structure [118][214], 2) knowledge-applicability assessment, which detects knowledge gaps by checking the similarities between theoretical scenarios and real-world scenarios [138][214], and 3) performance-triggered knowledge gap estimation, which detects knowledge gaps by considering the final execution performances [8][187]. Hierarchical knowledge structure checking has the rationale that if desired knowledge defined in a knowledge structure is missing in real-world situations, then knowledge gaps exist. Knowledge applicability assessment has a rationale that if the NLC situation is not similar with the previously-trained situations, then knowledge gaps exist. Performance-triggered knowledge gap estimation has a rationale that if the final NLC performances of a robot is not acceptable, then knowledge gaps exist.\nGap filling methods mainly include: using existing alternative knowledge such as “brush” in robot knowledge base to replace inappropriate knowledge “vacuum cleaner” in NLC tasks such as “clean a surface” [7][187], using general commonsense knowledge “drilling action needs driller” in a robot database to satisfy the need for a specific type of knowledge such as “tool for drilling a hole in the install a screw task” [187][214], asking knowledge input from human users by proactively asking questions such as “where is the table leg” [8][215][216], autonomously learning from the internet [8][215][216] etc. In a big picture, the essence of knowledge filling is a dynamic knowledgeupdating process, in which inaccurate knowledge has been replaced by accurate knowledge and missing knowledge has been compensated for by needed knowledge. During the gap filling, objectives of execution repairing follow this\npriority-descending order: ensuring execution naturalness → remaining robot autonomy → minimizing interruption\ntoward human → ensuring feasibility of task execution → admitting and reporting task failures. Only when a higher-\npriority objective cannot be achieved can lower-priority objectives be executed.\n6.2 Open problems\nEven with current knowledge-world mapping methods, in which a robot could conduct an effective NL-based cooperation, there are still open problems that impede the cooperation from being broadly implemented in practical daily living and industrial scenarios.\nFirst, problems of ambiguity, abstraction, information-incomplete and real-world inconsistent in human NL instructions during NLC are caused by intrinsic NL characteristics such as omitting, referring and simplifying. But the problems are also caused by the ignorance of environment perceiving and interpretation. For example, if information such as task-related objects’ working status, locations and relative distances from robot/human was ignored, it is difficult for a robot to infer which object the human user needs [111]. Second, when a human mentioned a task operation action or a tool, deep-level meanings such as “object functional role, operation’s purpose and importance in this plan” were not specified explicitly [217], limiting robots’ environment/user adaptation. Third, NLP is still not accurate enough to accurately extract task-related information [7]. Last, when a robot queries knowledge from either a human or the open knowledge database such as openCYC [218]for filling knowledge gaps, the scalability is limited. For a specific user or a specific open knowledge database, available contents are insufficient to cover general knowledge needs of robots in executing a wide range of NLC tasks. The time/labor cost is high, further undermining knowledge support for NLC. An efficient, low-cost and proactive knowledge learning capability is needed for a robot.\n7. Typical NLC applications\nWith the support of the above methodologies, four main types of NLC applications are developed, including NLbased robot control where only the NL-format control symbol is given and comprehensive instruction understating is not involved [168], NL-based robot training where a comprehensive instruction understanding is required and intuitive task execution is not conducted [219], NL-based robot task execution where comprehensive understanding towards human instructions, practical situation conditions and human intentions is required and intuitive task execution is conducted [113], and robot social companion where human’s social norms are required to be understood and respected, in addition to conducting NL-based execution [143].\nIn NL-based robot control, human hands are set free to reduce human’s physical burdens. NL was initially used to replace physical control means such as a joystick or human hands to realize robot control. During the control, NL plays a role as information-delivering media, which contains human’s control commands for robot executions. The human makes all the decisions in the control process, while a robot merely follows controlling commands delivered by human NL. From the burden-assignment perspective, during the whole cooperation process, the human mainly takes cognitive burdens, while a robot mainly takes physical burdens. Typical applications include control using symbolic words such as “start, stop” [110], using semantic correlations such as “goTo-left” [220], using logic\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\nstructures such as “food type – vessel shape correlations” [195], and using environmental conditions such as human safety [187], and location/building matching degree [17].\nIn NL-based robot training, a robot is endowed with the capability of advanced task planning and intuitive decision making by using NL to train robots on task executions in a spoken/written manner. During the training, knowledge is transferred from human experts to targeted robots. With consideration of robot physical characteristics such as force/structure/speed [221], human preferences such as motion/emotion [136], and real-world conditions such as object availability, distributions and locations [222], knowledge is specified for robot execution, improving robots’ ability in task understanding, environment perceiving and reasoning during NLC. Different from NL-based control where a robot is not involved in advanced reasoning, in NL-based robot training, a robot is required to reason the mechanisms behind human NL instructions. According to knowledge transferring manners, NL-based robot training is categorized into four main types: training using human speech [222], training using physical demonstration [223], training using human feedback [157] and training using robot proactive querying [224]. For training using human speech, physical demonstration and human feedback, the robot passively learns. The difference is, in natural speech, the human only orally describes and does not participate in the execution. While as in training using demonstration, a human need to execute, and in training using human feedback, a human gives either execution corrections or speech corrections. For training using robot proactive querying, a robot proactively asks and learns from a human.\nDifferent from NL-based robot training in which human NL is helping a robot with its task understanding, in NLbased robot task execution, human NL is helping a robot with its task execution [113]. In NL-based training, by\nTable. 3.

But in NL-based task execution, including understanding the task, a robot is also required to perceive surrounding environments [141], predict human intentions [113], and make optimal decisions by satisfying all the environment, task and human requirements [161]. Giving the reasoning work requested in NL-based task execution, robots’ cognition levels in NL-based execution is higher than that in NL-based training. With respect to who leads the execution, applications of NL-based execution could be categorized into the following two categories: 1) human-centered cooperation in which human is cognitively leading the task execution and a robot is required to provide appropriate assistances to facilitate humans’ executions [161], and 2) robot-centered cooperation where a robot is cognitively leading the task execution and the human is providing physical assistances to facilitate robots’ executions [127][149].\nIn NL-based robot social companion, to improve robot performances in NLC, social manners of humans and human communities are explored for robot learning. Different from NL-based task executions, which focus on execution methods, NL-based social companions focus on humans’ social norm understanding and imitating [143]. With a social manner, robots are more naturally integrated with a human to form a human-centered robot task execution system and robots could also be more socially-acceptable for human communities [225][226]. According to implementation manners of social norms, applications using NL-based social companion are mainly categorized into social communication in which social NL is used for facilitating mutual information exchanging during NLC [225][226], and social execution in which social NL is used for facilitating task execution during NLC [227][228].\n8. Future research directions\nEven though the current methodologies mentioned above could effectively support an intuitive NLC, there are still many aspects that could be improved. The following research summarized the potential research directions from our perspectives.\n8.1. Comprehensive NL understanding.\nAlthough semantic aspects about NLC cooperation tasks have been explored in a multi-modality manner, they are still not truly “comprehensive”. This is due to these methods being incapable of simultaneously performing accurate NL understanding, which is due to limited performances of NLP techniques [44], and intuitive environment interpretation, which is due to the lack of an intuitive sensor data fusion methods[8][191]. A temporal model for both understanding human’s NL instructions and exploring real-time correlations among multi-modality sensor data is in urgent need.\n8.2. Human cognition modeling\nThe human cognitive process is the decision-making mechanism behind human-robot interaction. A reasonable modeling of the human cognitive process influences the flexibility of NLC. First, in the human cognitive process, human-requested cooperation is performed with different importance degrees. Not all human-requirements on execution procedures and orders are essential for the success of task executions. For example, in the task “assembly”, the procedure “install the screw” is more important than the procedure “clean the place” [8][191]. Second, each of the specific operation requests is interpreted to practical meanings, such as “deliver me a brush” is for “cleaning the surface” and “cup” and “glass” in drinking have the same meaning as “containing drinkable liquid” [217]. By knowing this, NLC plans and manners could be flexibly changed by intuitively satisfying humans’ essential needs instead of strictly following literal instructions. Third, the theory foundation of the human cognitive process, which is developed in neural science, is lacking in robotics research. In the future, one direction of NLC research could be developing a reasonable human-cognitive-process model, which is with theory supports from neural science to effectively support a flexible decision making for robotics.\n8.3. Failure experience learning\nFailure causes unnatural or incorrect task executions. Learning-from-failure mechanism is implemented in computer science for algorithm performance improvement [229], in material science for new material discovery [230] etc. By exploring useful information in failure experiences, robots’ capability could be improved to avoid similar failures in the future. In NLC, learning from failure is initially involved in a definition-based manner [231], in which the failure is analyzed by comparing practical execution processes with defined knowledge, lacking the understanding of failure causes and meanwhile being passive in failure recovery. From our perspective, a future research direction in NLC could be developing effective failure-learning methodologies. By using these methodologies, failure causes\nsubmitted to Knowledge-based Systems, January 2017\ncould be analyzed and explained to users, useful experiences would be updated into robot knowledge databases, and similar failures could be avoided in subsequent NLC.\n8.4. Knowledge cost reduction\nCost reduction in knowledge collection is critical for intuitive NLC. On one hand, to understand human NL instructions, represent cooperation tasks, or fill in knowledge gaps, a large scale of reliable knowledge is needed. On the other hand, time/economy cost and labor investments need to be reduced. A knowledge-collection method for effectively collecting large amounts of knowledge with keeping costs low is in urgent need. To solve this problem, two trends in developing knowledge-scaling-up methods are designed: existing-knowledge exploitation, and new knowledge exploration. In existing-knowledge exploitation, existing specific knowledge is interpreted and extracted into general knowledge, thereby increasing knowledge interchangeability by making knowledge for specific situations suitable for general situations. In new-knowledge exploration, new knowledge is collected by proactively asking humans and autonomously retrieving from the Word Wide Web [232], books [233], operation logs [234] and videos [235]. These two trends have been initiated in the recent decade. From our perspective, future research could be using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, learning algorithms and information retrieval methods to transfer knowledge from information sources or even other robots to a robot, effectively reducing the cost in knowledge collection.\n8.5. Knowledge personalization\nWhen a robot cooperates with a specific human for a long time, the personalization of robots becomes critical. For personalization, it does not only mean defining individualized knowledge for a robot to adapt to a specific user, but it also means endowing a knowledge-individualization method for a robot to autonomously adapt to variable users [212]. In current NLC research, there are two trends on knowledge personalization: execution-preference-level personalization and the social-manner-level personalization. At the execution-preference level, one execution alternative is more preferred than the other alternatives [7]. In the social-manner level, a user’s emotions, such as “happy, sad, surprising”, and social norms, such as “safe zoon, comfortable distance”, were considered in decision making [212]. Therefore, a future research direction would be developing knowledge-personalization methods to consider both the execution preferences and social norms, enabling a long-term effective knowledge personalization process.\n9. Conclusion\nThis review summarized the state-of-the-art methodologies for realizing natural-language-based human-robot cooperation (NLC), providing an in-depth analysis of the methodology advantages/disadvantages/open problems. From a methodology perspective, this review paper mainly summarized NLC with three steps: human NL understanding, task knowledge representation, and knowledge-world mapping. Potential research directions have also been suggested for future NLC research.\n10.

Recently, research on using NL to support human-robot cooperation (HRC) has received increasing attention in several domains such as robotic daily assistance, robotic health caregiving, intelligent manufacturing, autonomous navigation and robot social accompany. However, a high-level review that can reveal the realization process and the latest methodologies of using NL to facilitate HRC is missing. In this review, a comprehensive summary about the methodology development of natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC) has been made. We first analyzed driving forces for NLC developments. Then, with a temporal realization order, we reviewed three main steps of NLC: human NL understanding, knowledge representation, and knowledge-world mapping. Last, based on our paper review and perspectives, potential research trends in NLC were discussed.",
