Combining strengths of both, we express models and inference as generalized coroutines in the same general-purpose language. We use existing facilities of the language, such as rich libraries, optimizing compilers, and types, to develop concise, declarative, and realistic models with competitive performance on exact and approximate inference. In particular, a wide range of models can be expressed using memoization. Because deterministic parts of models run at full speed, custom inference procedures are trivial to incorporate, and inference procedures can reason about themselves without interpretive overhead.

      "text" : "Declarative programming is the division of what to do and how to do it into two modules that can be built and reused separately. In the case of probabilistic inference, the what is the definition of a stochastic model, and the how is the implementation of an inference algorithm. Dividing the two formally makes it easier to understand and maintain the meaning of the model and the working of the algorithm, especially in complex domains where it is impractical to customize an algorithm to a model by hand coding.\nEver since Bayes nets were first used to represent distributions, declarative programming for probabilistic inference has been studied and practiced extensively (Koller et al. 1997; Getoor and Taskar 2007; Murphy 2007b; Goodman et al. 2008; inter alia). One approach is to encapsulate inference algorithms in a modeling toolkit, a library of distributions with operations such as conditionalization, then\nexpress models as client programs that invoke the toolkit through its API. Another approach is to express models in a probabilistic language, a programming language with constructs such as random choice, then encapsulate inference algorithms in interpreters or compilers for the language.\nThese two approaches are dual, in that a toolkit operation is run by a model whereas a language implementation runs a model. They also have complementary strengths.\nOn one hand, the development and use of a modeling toolkit takes advantage of an existing general-purpose language and its facilities such as types, a debugger, and I/O. In particular, if part of a model calls for a custom inference procedure, then the code for the model, written in the same language, can just perform the inference by sidestepping or extending the toolkit. Similarly, if a model needs to refer to an external database, then an existing connection library can be used. On the other hand, the syntax of a probabilistic language can express distributions more succinctly and naturally, as sampling procedures or by generalizing logic programs or relational databases. Also, models in a standalone language may be compiled to more efficient inference code (Fischer and Schumann 2003; Daumé 2007).\nThis paper presents a new technique for declarative probabilistic inference that combines these strengths. Using a generalization of coroutines, we express models as sampling procedures in the same general-purpose language in which we implement inference algorithms. Deterministic parts of models are expressed simply as code that makes no random choice, so they run at the full speed of the generalpurpose language. Our inference procedures are thus selfinterpreters, so they can reason about their own accuracy."

      "text" : "We begin to illustrate our monolingual approach using a tiny model (based on Figure 14.11 of Russell and Norvig 2003). To the left in Figure 1 is an influence diagram, in which each node represents a boolean variable. To the right is a corresponding model, expressed as a program in the general-purpose language OCaml (Leroy et al. 2008), for\ncomputing Pr(rain | wet_grass = true). This program uses the function dist, which maps a list of probabilityvalue pairs to a randomly chosen value, and the function fail, which takes a dummy argument and never returns because it observes an impossible event. Both functions are ordinary OCaml values defined by our framework, not special syntax in a standalone probabilistic language.\nFor convenience, the code in Figure 1 defines a flip function to flip a coin given its probability p of coming up true. The code then defines grass_model, which takes a dummy argument and either returns a random boolean (namely rain) or fails (if wet_grass is false). These functions are again ordinary OCaml values, of types float -> bool and unit -> bool respectively. The types float, bool, and unit and their values 0.5, true, and () are built-in to OCaml, so a typo such as misspelling true is caught by OCaml’s type checker at compile time.\nGiven that dist is akin to invoking a random-number generator, and that fail is akin to throwing an exception, we can of course perform naïve rejection sampling by applying a higher-order function to the argument grass_model. What is less obvious is that more efficient algorithms for exact and approximate inference can also be implemented as higher-order functions that take a model as argument and do not access its source code. The key to these implementations is for dist to suspend the execution of the model so that the inference procedure can resume it repeatedly, whether or not from the same point of suspension.\nOur model code can use side effects such as mutable state. Thus, we can use memoization to express nonparametric models such as Dirichlet processes (Goodman et al. 2008). For this purpose, we provide a higher-order function memo (of type (’a->’b)->(’a->’b)), which takes a function\nas argument and returns a memoized version of it. By applying memo mindlessly to thunks (that is, functions taking only a dummy argument) or using a simple preprocessor, we can also express lazy evaluation to speed up inference. For example, the code in Figure 2 eliminates the moot variable wet_roof in Figure 1 (here ’a is unit and ’b is bool): because OCaml (like most languages) waits until a function is called to evaluate its body, the choice flip 0.7 in the definition of wet_roof is never made, as desired."

We represent states as integers and define a data type obs of observations L and R.\ntype state = int let nstates = 8 type obs = L | R\nIf the states and observations get more complex, they should be represented using a structure such as a tuple or object that better matches the problem. Our random variables can be of any type, whether user-defined like obs or built-in like bool, int, tuples, dictionaries, and even functions. We can express distributions over values of all these types without encoding them as bit-strings or numbers.\nThe transitions are sparse, so we store their probabilities compactly in an array transition_prob of out-edge lists. For example, the array element transition_prob.(2) is the list [(0.4,2); (0.3,1); (0.3,3)]. We initialize the array by giving a general formula that follows the problem description, without repeating boilerplate literals like 0.4. As for observations, we tabulate in another array l_obs_prob the probability of observing L in each state.\nlet l_obs_prob = [| 1.0; 0.85714; ...; 0.0 |]\nTwo simple stochastic functions then express the transition and observation at each time step:\nlet evolve : state -> state = fun st -> dist (transition_prob.(st))\nlet observe : state -> obs = fun st -> let p = l_obs_prob.(st) in dist [(p, L); (1.-.p, R)]\nGiven a current state, the function evolve chooses the next state, and the function observe chooses the observation.

Applying exact_reify to query1 computes a table that maps states to (unnormalized) probability weights.\nOur code expressing the HMM and the query is easy to write and clearly matches the problem description. It is also flexible. For example, because we represent evidence as a function, it is trivial to change the condition from Obs5 = L to Obsn = L for all n between 5 and 10. It is also trivial to extend the model from 8 states to 64: just change nstates (and l_obs_prob if it is not defined by a general formula). There is no literal matrix to enlarge or state encoding to adjust. In contrast, the same change made models an order of magnitude bigger in the systems studied by Jaeger et al."

      "heading" : "2.3 I/O and self-interpretation for performance",
      "text" : "Another way that expressing models in a general-purpose language makes declarative inference more practical is that performance can be profiled and improved using familiar tools of the language. For example, using OCaml’s library function Sys.time, we soon discover that exact inference on run takes time exponential in n using exact_reify. Indeed, exact_reify makes an exponential number of recursive calls to run, as any programmer can easily learn using the OCaml profiler or by adding one line to run to increment a counter on every call. The Sys.time function and the call counter coexist indistinguishably with other functions and integers in the model proper.\nThe reason for the exponential time can be revealed using the OCaml debugger: exact_reify enumerates all possibilities and sums up their probabilities but does not coalesce repeated intermediate results in buckets. The Markov property lets us speed up inference, by expressing bucket\nelimination (Dechter 1999) in terms of exact_reify: we just surround run (n-1) evidence in the definition of run by dist (exact_reify (fun () -> ...)). Here exact_reify computes a bucket, then dist makes a random choice based on the bucket. On this revised run, exact inference using exact_reify takes time linear in n. This improvement is easily confirmed by measuring timings.\nThis expression of bucket elimination hinges on writing our model code and inference code in the same language: the inference procedure exact_reify needs to work on the revised model run, which in turn calls exact_reify. The recursion depth is unbounded—it is linear in n. Moreover, to improve performance at all, the new, inner calls to exact_reify need to run as fast as the original, outermost call. Indeed they do, being deterministic parts of the model. In short, our inference procedures are self-interpreters that can apply to themselves without interpretive overhead.\nTo express bucket elimination in general, we can replace any stochastic function f by the one below, without accessing the source code of dist, exact_reify, or memo.\nlet bucket = memo (fun x -> exact_reify (fun () -> f x)) in\nfun x -> dist (bucket x)\nThis expression should be evaluated—and memo called— before invoking inference, so that all inference shares the same bucket. This exact inference strategy handles Jaeger et al.’s benchmarks (2007) in at most a few seconds each."

      "heading" : "2.4 Reasoning about inference procedures themselves",
      "text" : "The ability for models to invoke a variety of inference procedures is unique to our monolingual approach. It is useful not just for performance but also for reasoning about inference itself, such as inference by and about other agents who use approximate inference procedures of their own.\nTo illustrate this expressivity, we start with a trivial model: Choose a coin that is either fair or completely biased for true, with equal probability. Let p be the probability that flipping the coin yields true. What is the probability that p is at least 0.3? It is 1, of course, because 0.5 ≥ 0.3 and 1≥ 0.3. In the model code below, the predicate at_least 0.3 true compares 0.3 against the probability of true in the probability tables computed by exact_reify coin.\nlet biased = flip 0.5 in let coin = fun () -> flip 0.5 || biased in at_least 0.3 true (exact_reify coin)\nBecause a random choice made by an inference algorithm is expressed with dist just like any other random choice, any inference procedure, such as the importance-sampling\nalgorithm in §4, can reason about itself or any other inference procedure. For example, suppose we choose a coin as before, then estimate p by flipping the coin twice and dividing the count of true by 2. What is the overall probability that our estimate is at least 0.3? It is 7/8, because for us to estimate below 0.3 is to choose a fair coin then get false from it twice. We can compute this answer in our system by changing exact_reify above to a call to sampling twice. This change meaningfully affects what probability tables are tested by at_least 0.3 true. As with Goodman et al.’s nested query (2008), the outer and inner models may each invoke fail to express observations at different levels. However, nested query only lets models nest models, not inference, and returns samples, not tables.\nThis meta-reasoning capability is compatible with memoization. For example, the random variable biased above is defined at the outer level of reasoning but used at the inner level (within coin), yet we can memoize biased as usual:\nlet biased = memo (fun () -> flip 0.5) in let coin = fun () -> flip 0.5 || biased () in at_least 0.3 true (exact_reify coin)"

      "heading" : "3 Reifying a model into a search tree",
      "text" : "As illustrated above, we express models, including any observed evidence, as sampling procedures that may fail. Even without inspecting the source code of models so expressed, rejection sampling is easy: just define dist to make a random choice and fail to throw an exception. In this section, we explain how to implement dist and fail differently to support more efficient inference. The bottom line is that we can convert a model to a search tree of random choices. Traversing this tree differently gives rise to exact enumeration (and bucket elimination, as shown in §2.3) and importance sampling (as explained in §4).\nTo support more than rejection sampling, dist should account for multiple possible outcomes of a random choice, not just commit to one of them. For example, calling flip should not actually flip a coin but rather explore both outcomes. One way to achieve such nondeterminism is to split the computation into two threads, one for each outcome, and merge their results when they finish. This splitting is exactly what the POSIX system call fork does, namely to clone the current process to form a new child process. Each call to fork returns twice: in the parent process, it returns the child process ID; in the child process, it returns 0.\nBecause dist represents probabilistic choice, we have to track the probability mass of the thread, in a thread-local variable prob. For example, evaluating flip 0.9 should in turn invoke fork, then in one thread multiply prob by 0.9 and return true, and in the other thread multiply prob by 0.1 and return false. In OCaml syntax, this implementation of dist looks as follows.\nlet dist = fun [(p1,v1); (p2,v2)] -> if fork () then prob := prob *. p1; v1\nelse prob := prob *. p2; v2\nAs for fail, it can be implemented as abort in POSIX, which terminates the thread and never returns any value.\nAn inference procedure such as exact_reify receives a model as just a thunk. To run the given model, the inference procedure invokes the thunk in a new thread in which prob is initialized to 1. Deterministic parts of the model run at the full speed of the general-purpose language, because they invoke neither dist nor fail. By the time the model finishes, it may finish in any number of threads. For exact enumeration, exact_reify can simply accumulate in a probability table the final outcome and probability mass reported by each thread as it finishes.\nThis implementation strategy works in any language that supports POSIX processes or user-level threads. Most languages qualify, including C, Perl, and Scheme. However, it is inadequate for two reasons, which we address below. Our final implementation requires no OS support for processes and threads; we mention fork only for exposition."

      "heading" : "3.1 Exploring random choices lazily",
      "text" : "As the model keeps making random choices, the threads may proliferate so much that running them all in parallel becomes impractical or causes thrashing. Besides, we may only want to run some possible threads. We need tighter control over which possible outcomes to explore: dist should suspend the current thread before calling fork, and resume only when the inference procedure says to.\nMore specifically, the suspended thread should provide the inference procedure with a list of possible outcomes and their probabilities, so that the inference procedure can pick which outcomes to explore. Each time the inference procedure requests to explore an outcome, the suspended thread should fork off a thread in which dist proceeds to return that outcome to the model after updating prob. In short, dist should turn the current thread into a server to the inference procedure for exploring possible outcomes.\nWith the implementation of dist so revised, an inference procedure receives a model as an open possibility in the following sense. An open possibility is a request that can be made to a suspended server thread and yields a response. A response is a list of probability-possibility pairs. A possibility is either closed, in which case it is just the final outcome value produced by a finished thread, or open. (This recursive definition can be formalized in OCaml as follows.\ntype ’a vc = V of ’a | C of (unit -> ’a pV) and ’a pV = (float * ’a vc) list\nWe represent a request as a thunk that returns a response.\nThe type ’a above is that of final outcomes. The type ’a vc is that of possibilities (the variant V for closed and the variant C for open), and the type ’a pV is that of responses.)\nMaking dist suspend the computation thus enables an inference procedure to step through a stochastic model from choice to choice. Still, the fact that OCaml programs are compiled and cannot inspect their own source code or trace their own execution ensures that the deterministic parts of the model run at full speed. That is, we implement dist so as to convert, or reify, a model to a lazily computed tree of choices. Leaves of the tree are closed possibilities, whereas uncomputed branch of the tree are open possibilities. To request an open possibility is to compute the branch.\nThis tree is a search tree because an inference procedure should search it for leaves with high probability and avoid leaves that fail. The model, computing the branches, and the inference procedure, managing the exploration, transfer control to each other like coroutines. For example, exact_reify performs depth-first search and accumulates leaves in a probability table as it finds them. This strategy suffices for all the examples so far, but other strategies such as iterative deepening can be used. In §4, we introduce a stochastic search strategy that amounts to importance sampling. It is also possible to represent independent choices compactly using AND nodes in the search tree (McAllester et al. 2008); the use of self-interpretation to express bucket elimination in §2.3 can be viewed as such a representation."

      "heading" : "3.2 Generalizing coroutines to lightweight threads",
      "text" : "POSIX processes and fork are rather heavyweight facilities to use for probabilistic programming, and not all operating systems provide them. In comparison, user-level threads can be much more efficient; for example, Erlang programs routinely create millions of simultaneous threads. User-level threads also ease storage management (unused threads can be garbage-collected) and obviate marshalling final outcomes from the model to the inference procedure.\nFollowing Filinski (1994), our OCaml implementation uses a library (Kiselyov 2006) of delimited control operators (Felleisen et al. 1987; Danvy and Filinski 1990), which generalize coroutines and user-level threads. (Analogues of the library are available for Haskell, Scheme, and some SML implementations.) The library offers two operations on the execution stack:\n• Reset pushes a delimiter onto the stack, as if installing an exception handler. • Shift pops frames off the stack until it encounters a\ndelimiter, as if throwing an exception, but it captures the frames and creates a function that can be called to push them back onto the stack. The frames constitute a delimited continuation, which is like a Common Lisp restart but can be reinstated multiple times.\nReset plays the role of creating a new thread. Our implementation of reification invokes reset to delimit each model from the rest of the program. The delimiter stays on the stack while the model runs using younger frames. If the model finishes with a final outcome, then the delimiter is removed like an unused exception handler, and the outcome is returned to the rest of the program as a closed possibility.\nShift plays the role of suspending a thread and turning it into a server. Our implementation of dist invokes shift to transfer control from the model to the rest of the program, whose stack frames are beyond the delimiter. The delimited continuation captured by shift can be used by the rest of the program to resume the model’s execution. Our implementation of fail also invokes shift, but discards the captured continuation, so it is exactly like throwing an exception.\nBesides dist and fail, we also provide a higher-order function memo for memoization, used in §1.1 and §2.3. The implementation of memo is straightforward, except each thread (that is, each open possibility) must maintain its own table of memoized results. For example, the repeated calls to the thunk rain in Figure 2, like the repeated references to the variable rain in Figure 1, should always return the same result in each thread, but that result may be true in one thread and false in another. Thus, memo must not mutate the global heap, but rather use or emulate storage local to each thread in which memo is called (Haynes 1987)."

      "text" : "Given a model reified as a search tree, rejection sampling is just traversing the tree from the root to a leaf, using the probabilities specified at each branch to make a random choice. If this traversal is so lucky as to avoid failure, then the leaf it reaches can be reported—that is, accumulated in a histogram—as a final outcome with weight 1.\nIn many realistic models, the observed evidence is very improbable, so rejection sampling takes too long to yield enough samples. Importance sampling (Fung and Chang 1990; Shachter and Peot 1990) is a well-known improvement. To perform importance sampling on probabilistic programs written in IBAL, Pfeffer (2007b) developed several sophisticated techniques, which amount to call-byneed evaluation and pushing evidence towards choices.\nPfeffer’s techniques require analyzing the source code of the model. Our inference procedures do not have that luxury, because OCaml programs cannot inspect their own source code. Still, we can adapt the idea to operate on a reified search tree: at each branch, we look ahead briefly into each child to sniff out any shallow failures, so as to choose a random child using tighter upper bounds on each child’s probability mass. This adaptation has the performance advantage that models can be compiled by OCaml for speed and their deterministic parts run at full speed.\nGiven a model (as an open possibility, as described in §3.1), our importance-sampling algorithm proceeds as follows.\n1. Initialize the weight pc to 1. 2. Request the given model to get R, a response, that is,\na list of probability-possibility pairs. 3. Loop until R is empty:\nIf R consists of a single element (p,P) where P is an open possibility, then set pc to pc · p, request P to get a new response R, and continue with the loop. Otherwise, initialize L to the empty list of probabilityresponse pairs, then for every element (p,P) of R: (a) If P is a closed possibility, then report the final\noutcome P with the weight pc · p. (b) Otherwise, request the open possibility P and call\nthe response R′. If R′ consists of a single element (p′,v) where v is a closed possibility, then report the final outcome v with the weight pc · p · p′. Otherwise, let pt be the total probability in the list R′, and add the pair (p · pt ,R′) to the list L.\nLet pt be the total probability in the list L. Quit if pt is zero. Otherwise: Randomly choose an element (p,R′) from L with probability proportional to p. Set pc to pc · pt . Set R to the result of normalizing R′. Continue.\nThis algorithm may report multiple fractional outcomes on each run, because it treats shallow successes like shallow failures and only stops when R is empty. It subsumes likelihood weighting for Bayes nets, because a choice observed right away to be equal to some value is set to that value."

Therefore, our models should be coded using lazy evaluation, or Pfeffer’s delayed evaluation (2007b). As demonstrated in §1.1, lazy evaluation can be expressed in terms of memoization. Moreover, a composite data structure such as a tuple or list should subject each of its components separately to lazy evaluation, so that, for instance, two lists of independent coin flips can be appended without actually determining any of the flips.

      "text" : "To gauge the efficacy of this approximate inference strategy on problems of realistic complexity, we reimplemented the classical-music model that Pfeffer (2007b) built to test his importance sampler. The model is of motivic development in early Beethoven piano sonatas. A motif is a list of notes. To develop a motif is to randomly and recursively divide it into a binary tree, then randomly and recursively delete or transpose each subtree. The leaves of the resulting tree form a new motif (using lappend above). The randomness and recursion make the number of possible developments exponential in the length of the source motif.\nWe ran our importance sampler as well as Pfeffer’s IBAL sampler on 49 inference problems, each to compute the likelihood that a given source motif S ∈ {1, . . . ,7} develops into a given destination motif D ∈ {1, . . . ,7}. The goal is to infer the maximum-likelihood S from D. The ground truth is that S = i iff D = i, but the two motives are different lists of notes—Table 1 shows their lengths. Exact inference is already infeasible for length 5, and the likelihoods are on the order of 10−7, so rejection sampling is hopeless.\nFor each problem, we ran 100 trials in which Pfeffer’s sampler had 30 seconds per trial (following his original testing), 100 trials in which our sampler had 30 seconds per trial, and another 100 trials in which our sampler had 90\nseconds per trial. Using these trials, we estimated the probabilities that the samplers choose the correct S for each D. Table 1 shows these accuracy estimates, which suggest that our sampler is competitive with Pfeffer’s.\nFocusing on a typical inference problem, Figure 3 shows a histogram of lnPr(D = 1 | S = 1) sampled. This plot excludes one IBAL trial and five 30-second trials that returned likelihood 0. On this problem, IBAL’s likelihood estimates had mean exp(−14.7) and standard deviation exp(−15.3); our 90-second sampler’s had mean exp(−13.8) and standard deviation exp(−14.5); and our 30-second sampler’s had mean exp(−13.7) and standard deviation exp(−14.0).\nBesides the music model, we reimplemented Milch et al.’s model of radar blips for aircraft tracking (2007). In this model, a 10× 10 radar screen monitors a region in the air with an unknown number of planes that move and turn randomly. At each time step, each plane causes a blip on the screen with a certain probability. Due to limited resolution, several planes may result in a single blip. Blips may also be caused by noise. The problem is to estimate the number of planes from blips and their absence in consecutive radar screenshots. A further step is to identify the planes.\nTo keep inference tractable, we subjected each location coordinate of a plane or blip separately to lazy evaluation, and we used nested inference (as explained in §2.3) to turn our importance sampler into a particle filter. Our model takes many of its parameters from David Poole’s AILog 2 code.\nWhen we set the noise probability low, the exact solution could be computed and matched our sampling results. With more noise, our sampling results stayed reasonable. For example, we let there be up to 7 planes (a geometric distribution with ratio .15), detected with probability .9, and up to 4 noise blips (geometric with ratio .02). Having seen the blips (3,5),(3,7),(3,9) at time 0, our sampler found any number of planes possible between 1 and 6, but 3 was most likely, with conditional probability .835. After further observing the blips (4,5),(4,7),(4,9) at time 1 and (5,5), (5,7),(5,9) at time 2, there remained only the possibilities of 3 planes (with conditional probability .987) and 4."

For example:\n• The Bayes Net Toolbox (Murphy 2007a) is a MATLAB library, but its models are not expressed in MATLAB using rand, so it cannot reason about itself.\n• IBAL (Pfeffer 2007a) is implemented in OCaml, but it cannot reason about OCaml code as is, such as itself. • Church (Goodman et al. 2008) and Probabilistic Scheme (Radul 2007) are both based on Scheme and implemented using Scheme with mutable state, but they cannot reason about their own implementations, such as about their own inference accuracy. • Infer.NET (Minka et al. 2009) is implemented on top of C# and compiles models represented in a language that resembles C#, but it cannot reason about C# code as is, such as itself. • AutoBayes (Fischer and Schumann 2003) and HBC (Daumé 2007) are compilers of specialized languages for statistical models, not of the languages that they target (such as C) or are implemented in (Prolog and Haskell), so they cannot reason about themselves.\nSelf-interpretation is in principle trivial to achieve, say by writing an interpreter of OCaml in IBAL, but it would be impractically slower than running OCaml code directly, by a factor exponential in the number of interpretation levels. In contrast, our approach incurs no interpretive overhead.\nWe build on functional rather than logic programming, because we find a functional language more natural for expressing procedural knowledge such as inference algorithms. This choice sets our monolingual approach apart from PRISM (Sato 2008), BLOG (Milch et al. 2007), AILog (Poole and Mackworth 2009), and Markov logic (Domingos and Richardson 2007).\nTo conclude, we have presented monolingual probabilistic programming, which lets one write declarative stochastic models, deterministic computations, and inference procedures all in the same language. We use mature implementations such as OCaml (SML and Haskell are easily possible). Our approach can express a broad range of models concisely and is amenable to efficient inference. The ability to reify a stochastic program into a lazy search tree lets users write optimized inference procedures, such as importance sampling with look-ahead. The optimizations let us handle realistic models with competitive performance."
