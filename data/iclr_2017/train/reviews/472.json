{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder", "abstract": "Sparse coding represents a signal by a linear combination of only a few atoms of a learned over-complete dictionary. While sparse coding exhibits compelling performance for various machine learning tasks, the process of obtaining sparse code with fixed dictionary is independent for each data point without considering the geometric information and manifold structure of the entire data. We propose Support Regularized Sparse Coding (SRSC) which produces sparse codes that account for the manifold structure of the data by encouraging nearby data in the manifold to choose similar dictionary atoms. In this way, the obtained support regularized sparse codes capture the locally linear structure of the data manifold and enjoy robustness to data noise. We present the optimization algorithm of SRSC with theoretical guarantee for the optimization over the sparse codes. We also propose a feed-forward neural network termed Deep Support Regularized Sparse Coding (Deep-SRSC) as a fast encoder to approximate the sparse codes generated by SRSC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SRSC and Deep-SRSC.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "I'd like to thank the authors for their detailed response to my questions.\n\nThe paper proposes a support regularized version of sparse coding that takes into account the underlying manifold structure of the data.

The paper argues that using a support based regularizer is superior to using a standard graph Laplacian regularizer (which has been explored before), although this argument is not developed particularly rigorously and dominantly has to fall back on empirical evidence. The main contribution of the paper appears to be theoretical justification of an alternating optimization scheme for minimizing the resulting objective function (yet the optimization aspects of dealing with a sparse support regularizer are somewhat orthogonal to the current context). The empirical results are not very convincing since the dictionary size is relatively large compared to the dataset size; the gains with respect to l2 manifold regularizer are not consistent; and the gains using deep architectures to directly predict sparse codes are also modest and somewhat inconsistent. These points aside, the reviewers are overall enthusiastic about the paper and find it to be well written and complete.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Support Regularized Sparse Coding and Its Fast Encoder", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The work proposes to use the geometry of data (that is considered to be known a priori) in order to have more consistent sparse coding. Namely, two data samples that are similar or neighbours, should have a sparse code that is similar (in terms of support). The general idea is not unique, but it is an interesting one (if one admits that the adjacency matrix A is known a priori), and the novelty mostly lies on the definition of the regularisation term that is an l1-norm (while other techniques would mostly use l2 regularisation).\n\nBased on this idea, the authors develop a new SRSC algorithm, which is analysed in detail and shown to perform better than its competitors based on l2 sparse coding regularisation and other schemes in terms of clustering performance.\n\nInspired by LISTA, the authors then propose an approximate solution to the SRSC problem, called Deep-SRSC, that acts as a sort of fast encoder. Here too, the idea is interesting and seems to be quite efficient from experiments on USPS data, even if the framework seems to be strongly inspired from LISTA. That scheme should however be better motivated, by the limitations of SRSC that should be presented more clearly. \n\nOverall, the paper is well written, and pretty complete. It is not extremely original in its main ideas though, but the actual algorithm and implementation seem new and effective.

The resulting algorithm is relatively complex and computationally relatively expensive, but the authors provide detailed derivations and use arguments from proximal gradient descent methods to prove convergence (I did not follow all the derivations, only some). In general the paper is well written and the authors explain the motivation behind the algorithms design in detail. \n\nIn the abstract the authors mention \u201cextensive experimental results \u2026\u201d, but I find the experiments not very convincing: With experiments on the USPS handwritten digits dataset (why not MNIST?), COIL-20 and COIL-100 and UCI, the datasets are all relatively small and the algorithm is run with dictionary sizes between p=100 to p=500. This seems surprising because the authors state that they implemented SRSC in \u201cCUDA C++ with extreme efficiency\u201d (page 10). But more importantly, I find it hard to interpret and compare the results: The paper reports accuracy and and normalized mutual information for a image retrieval / clustering task where the proposed SRSC is used as a feature extractor. The improvements relative to standard Sparse Coding seem very small  (often < 1% in terms of NMI; it looks more promising in terms of accuracy) and if I understand the description on page 11 correctly, than the test set was used to select some hyperparameters (the best similarity measure for clustering step)? There is no comparisons to other baselines / state of the art image clustering methods.\nBesides of providing features for a small scale image clustering system, are there maybe ways to more directly evaluate the properties and qualities of  a sparse coding approach? E.g. reconstruction error / sparsity; maybe even denoising performance?\n \nIn summary, I think in it current form the paper lacks the evaluation and experimental results for an ICLR publication. Intuitively, I agree with the authors that the proposed regularization is an interesting direction, but I don\u2019t see experiments that directly show that the regularization has the desired effect; and the improvements in the clustering task where SRSC is used as a feature extractor are very modest.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016 (modified: 25 Jan 2017)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "\nI'd like to thank the authors for their detailed response to my questions.\n\nThe paper proposes a support regularized version of sparse coding that takes into account the underlying manifold structure of the data.
