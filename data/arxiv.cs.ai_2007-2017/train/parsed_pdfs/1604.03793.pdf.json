      "text" : "HordeSAT [3] is a modular massively parallel SAT solver which allows the integration of any sequential CDCL-based SAT solver in its core. This enables the transfer of advancements in CDCL SAT solving to a parallel setting. Experiments showed that HordeSAT can achieve superlinear average speedup on hard benchmarks.\nThe logic of quantified Boolean formulas (QBFs) extends SAT by explicit quantification of propositional variables. Problems in complexity classes beyond NP, particularly PSPACE-complete problems in domains like, e.g., formal verification, reactive synthesis, or planning, can naturally be encoded as QBFs.\nQBF solvers based on QCDCL, the QBF-specific variant of CDCL, apply techniques similar to CDCL SAT solvers. Thanks to this fact, it is possible to replace the SAT solver in the core of HordeSAT by any QCDCL QBF solver. Thereby, it is not necessary to change the framework of HordeSAT which controls the sharing of learned information and the execution of the core solver instances.\nWe integrated the latest public version 5.0 of the QCDCL-based solver DepQBF [18] in HordeSAT to obtain the massively parallel QBF solver HordeQBF. We present the implementation of HordeQBF, which is not tailored towards the use of DepQBF as a core solver, and evaluate its scalability on a computer cluster\n?

      "text" : "We consider closed QBFs ψ := Π.φ in prenex CNF (PCNF) consisting of a quantifier-free CNF φ over a set V of variables and a quantifier prefix Π := Q1v1 . . . Qnvn in which Qi ∈ {∃,∀} and vi ∈ V . QBF solving with clause and cube learning (QCDCL) [9,15,27], also called constraint learning, is a generalization of conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) for SAT. The variables in a PCNF ψ are assigned by decision making, unit propagation, and pure literal detection. Assignments by decision making have to follow the prefix ordering from left to right. If a clause is falsified under the current assignment A, then a learned clause C is derived from ψ by Q-resolution [14] and added conjunctively to ψ. If all clauses are satisfied under A, then a learned cube is constructed from A and added disjunctively to ψ. Learned cubes may also be derived by term resolution [9], a variant of Q-resolution applied to previously learned cubes. After a new clause or cube has been learned, assignments are retracted during backtracking. QCDCL terminates if and only if the empty clause (resp. cube) is derived during learning, indicating that ψ is unsatisfiable (resp. satisfiable)."

      "heading" : "3 Related Work",
      "text" : "Approaches to parallel QBF solving are based on shared and distributed memory architectures. PQSolve [7] is an early parallel DPLL [5] solver without knowledge sharing. It comes with a dynamic master/slave framework implemented using the message passing interface (MPI) [10]. Search space is partitioned among master and slaves by variable assignments. QMiraXT [16] is a multithreaded QCDCL solver with search space partitioning. PAQuBE [17] is an MPI-based parallel variant of the QCDCL solver QuBE [8]. Clause and cube sharing in PAQuBE can be adapted dynamically at run time. Search space is partitioned like in the SAT solver PSATO based on guiding paths [25]. The MPI-based solver MPIDepQBF [13] implements a master/worker architecture without knowledge sharing. A worker consists of an instance of the QCDCL solver DepQBF [19]. The master balances the workload by generating subproblems defined by variable assignments (assumptions), which are solved by the workers. Parallel solving approaches have also been presented for quantified CSPs [24] and non-PCNF QBFs [21].\nHordeQBF is a parallel portfolio solver with clause and cube sharing. Whereas sequential portfolio solvers like AQME [23] include different QBF solvers, HordeQBF integrates instances of the same QCDCL solver (i.e., DepQBF). Unlike MPIDepQBF, HordeQBF does not rely on search space partitioning. Instead, the parallel instances of DepQBF are diversified by different parameter settings."

      "heading" : "4 The HordeSAT Parallelization Framework",
      "text" : "HordeSAT is a portfolio SAT solver with clause sharing [3]. It can be viewed as a multithreaded program running several instances of a sequential SAT solver and communicating via MPI with other instances of the same program.\nThe parallelization framework has three main tasks: to ensure that the core solvers are diversified, to handle the clause exchange, and to stop all the solvers when one of them has solved the problem. To communicate with the core solvers it uses an API which is described in detail in the HordeSAT paper [3]. Since the HordeQBF interface is identical, we only briefly list the most relevant methods:\nvoid diversify(int rank, int size): This method tells the core solver to diversify\nits settings. The specifics of diversification are left to the solver. The description for DepQBF is given in the following section.\nvoid addLearnedClause(vector<int> clause): This method is used to im-\nport learned clauses (and cubes) received from other solvers of the portfolio.\nvoid setLearnedClauseCallback(LCCallback* callback): This method sets\na callback class that will process the clauses (and cubes) shared by this solver."

      "heading" : "5 QBF Solver Integration",
      "text" : "In parallel QCDCL-based QBF solving, learned cubes may be shared among the solver instances in addition to learned clauses. Although HordeSAT does not provide API functions dedicated to cube sharing, its available API readily supports it. We describe the integration of the QCDCL-based QBF solver DepQBF3 in HordeQBF, which applies to any QCDCL-based QBF solver.\nWe rely on version 5.0 of DepQBF which comes with a dynamic variant of blocked clause elimination (QBCE) [18] for advanced cube learning. QBCE allows to eliminate redundant clauses from a PCNF [11]. Dynamic QBCE is applied frequently during the solving process. If all clauses in the PCNF are satisfied under the current assignment or removed by QBCE, then a cube is learned.\nDepQBF features a sophisticated analysis of variable dependencies in a PCNF [19,20] to relax the linear ordering of variables in the prefix. For the experiments in this paper, however, we disabled dependency analysis for both HordeQBF and the sequential variant of DepQBF since the use of dependency information causes run time overhead (during clause/cube learning) in addition to overhead already caused by dynamic blocked clause elimination (QBCE) [18].\nWe modified DepQBF as follows to integrate it in HordeQBF. Learned constraints are exported to the master process right after they have been learned. The master does not distinguish between learned clauses and cubes but treats them as sorted lists of literals. We add special marker literals to learned clauses and cubes to distinguish between them at the time when the master provides the workers with sets of shared learned constraints.\n3 http://lonsing.github.io/depqbf/\nIn DepQBF we check whether shared constraints are available for import after a restart has been carried out. To this end, we modified the restart policy of DepQBF to always backtrack to decision level zero. This is different from the original restart policy of DepQBF [19], where the solver backtracks to higher decision levels depending on the current assignment. After a restart, available shared constraints are imported, the watched data structures are updated, and QCDCL continues by propagating unit literals resulting from imported constraints.\nEvery instance of DepQBF receives a random seed from the master and diversifies the solving process as follows. The values of variables in the assignment cache [22] are initialized at random. In general, decision variables are assigned to the cached value (if any). The assignment cache is updated with values assigned by\nunit propagation and pure literal detection. As an effect of random initialization, the first value assigned to a decision variable is always a random value. Parameters of variable activity scaling are set at random. DepQBF implements variable activities similar to MiniSAT [6]. Additionally, the amount (percentage) of learned constraints that are removed periodically is initialized at random. DepQBF stores learned clauses and cubes in separate lists with certain capacities. If a list has been filled during learning then less frequently used constraints are removed and the capacity of the list is increased. DepQBF implements a nested restart scheme similar to PicoSAT [4], the parameters of which are randomly selected. Variants of dynamic QBCE [18] are enabled at random, including switching off dynamic QBCE at all, or applying QBCE only as a preprocessing or inprocessing step. Finally, applications of long-distance resolution [1,26], an extension of traditional Q-resolution [14] used to derive learned constraints, are toggled at random."

      "heading" : "6 Experimental Evaluation",
      "text" : "To examine our portfolio-based parallel QBF solver HordeQBF we performed experiments using all the 735 benchmark problems from the application track of the 2014 QBF Gallery [12]. We compared HordeQBF with DepQBF, which is the QBF solver in the core of HordeQBF.\nThe experiments were run on a cluster with nodes having two octa-core 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2670 processors (Sandy Bridge) and 64 GB of main memory. Each node has 16 cores and we used 64 nodes which amounts in the total of 1024 cores. The nodes communicate using an InfiniBand 4X QDR Interconnect and use the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 (x86 64) (patch level 3) operating system. HordeQBF was compiled using the icpc compiler version 15.0.2. The complete source code and detailed experimental results are available at http://baldur.iti.kit.edu/hordesat/.\nWe ran experiments using 2, 4, . . . , 64 cluster nodes. On each node we ran four processes with four threads each, which amounts to 16 core solver (DepQBF) instances per node. The results are summarized in Figure 1 using cactus plots. We can observe that increasing the number of cores is beneficial for both SAT and UNSAT instances since the number of solved instances steadily increases and runtimes are reduced.\nHowever, it is not easy to see from a cactus plot whether the additional performance is a reasonable return on the invested hardware resources. Therefore we include Table 1 in order to quantify the overall scalability of HordeQBF. We compute speedups for all the instances solved by the parallel solver. We ran DepQBF with a time limit T = 50 000s and for the instances it did not solve we use the runtime of T in speedup calculation. The parallel configurations have a time limit of 900s. Columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 1 show the average, total (sum of sequential runtimes divided by the sum of parallel runtimes) and median speedup values respectively. While the average and total speedup values are high, the median speedup is below one.\nNevertheless, these figures treat HordeQBF unfairly since the majority of the benchmarks is easy (solvable under a minute by DepQBF) and it makes no sense to use large computer clusters to solve them. In parallel computing, it is usual to analyze the performance on many processors using weak scaling where one increases the amount of work involved in the considered instances proportionally to the number of processors. Therefore in columns 7–9 we restrict ourselves to “big instances” – where DepQBF needs at least 10×(the number of cores used by HordeQBF) seconds to solve them. The average, total and median speedup values get significantly larger and in fact we obtain highly superlinear average and median speedups. Figure 2 shows the distribution of speedups for these instances, it also reveals how many instances (x-axis) qualify as “big instances”."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We showed that QBF solving can be successfully parallelized using the same techniques as for massively parallel SAT solving. Our parallel QBF solver HordeQBF achieved superlinear total and median speedups for hard instances, i.e., instances where parallelization makes sense.\nAs future work it would be interesting to consider further variants of Qresolution systems [2] (apart from traditional [14] and long-distance resolution [1,26]) as a means of diversification in HordeQBF, which would amount to a combination of QBF proof systems with different power. Further, it may be promising to equip HordeQBF with search space partitioning as in MPIDepQBF [13]."
