      "text" : "Diagrams have been used to illustrate geometric theorems and problems for thousands of years and can be produced now by using computer programs with ease. A number of software tools developed in the area of dynamic geometry are capable of generating dynamic diagrams automatically from specifications of geometric theorems [33]. This paper tackles the inverse problem: given the electronic image of a diagram, generate the specifications of one or more theorems which the diagram may be used to illustrate. An ideal solution to this problem allows one to generate geometric theorems automatically from their illustrations available in electronic documents and resources.\nTo be specific, let us restrict our study to plane Euclidean geometry in this paper. The approach we propose to solve the above-stated problem consists of the following main steps.\n1. Retrieve geometric information, mainly geometric objects and their labels, in the given image of diagram using techniques of pattern recognition (in particular Hough transform as discussed in Sections 2.1 and 2.2).\naSKLSDE - School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing 100191, China.

Obtain theorems from the generated candidate propositions using algebraic methods, first to rule out false propositions efficiently by checking numeric instances and then to prove the true propositions via symbolic computation (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3).\nThese four steps are described in detail in the following two sections. We have implemented the proposed approach. Preliminary experiments with our implementation are reported in Section 4. Some related work on geometric information retrieval and theorem discovery is discussed briefly in Section 5. The paper concludes with a few remarks in Section 6.\nThe work presented in this paper demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of discovering rigorous and profound geometric knowledge (theorems) from inexact and partial geometric data (images of diagrams) automatically. This feasibility brings us the hope to build up a large-scale database of geometric theorems automatically or semi-automatically by searching diagrams from electronic documents and resources accessible via the Internet. Theorems collected in such a database will have standardized formal representations and are linked to images of diagrams. The processing and management of theorems in the database, including searching, organization, translation (into representations in natural languages or algebraic expressions), and degenerate-case handling, would be made easier or more efficient.\nA potential application of our work in education is evident. An extension of the proposed approach to dealing with hand-drawn diagrams could make it possible for students to submit geometric theorems to provers by simply sketching their diagrams on mobile computing devices."

      "heading" : "2.1 Recognizing Basic Geometric Objects",
      "text" : "In our current investigation we consider the following three types of basic geometric objects which are used to form most of the diagrams in plane Euclidean geometry.\n• Points. A point is represented by a pair of coordinates (x, y) in the coordinate system determined by the image of diagram, where the parameters x and y are called x-coordinate and y-coordinate, respectively.\n• Lines. A straight line (with no extremes) is represented by line(P1, P2), where the parameters P1 and P2 denote two distinct points incident to the line. Similarly, a half line is represented by halfline(O,P ), where the parameter O denotes its initial point and P denotes a point on it; a segment is represented by segment(E1, E2), where the parameters E1 and E2 denote the endpoints of the segment. For the sake of convenience, all straight lines, half lines, and segments, with respective types line, halfline, and segment, are called lines.\n• Circles. A circle may be represented by circle(O, r), where the parameter O denotes the center of the circle and r (> 0) denotes the radius of the circle, and by circle(A,B,C), where the parameters A, B, and C denote three distinct points on the circle.\nA geometric object may be referred to by an identifier which is called the label of the object. For example, the point (x, y) with label P is represented as P := (x, y); the straight line with label l passing through P1 and P2 is represented as l := line(P1, P2).\nRecognition of a basic geometric object O means to determine the parameter values of O. For example, a circle can be recognized by determining the coordinates of its center and the value of its radius.\nOur approach to recognizing basic geometric objects from images of diagrams is based on Hough transform [10], a general technique for estimating the parameters of a shape from its boundary points. Through Hough transform, the detection of a shape is converted to a voting procedure carried out in a parameter space. For instance, the detection of a line can be realized by checking whether the number of curves (corresponding to the points on the line) crossing at a certain point (corresponding to the line) in the parameter space is greater than a threshold. However, due to the effects of image quality, line width, and concrete recognition requirements, the results obtained via Hough transform might not perfectly reflect the actual features of the geometric diagrams. For example, a line may be detected as several disconnected short segments; the position and the size of a circle may be not the same as they are in the diagram. To improve the accuracy of recognition for basic geometric objects, we adopt some techniques to refine the results of Hough transform, as described in\nthe following algorithm.1\nAlgorithm 1 (Geometric object recognition). Given an image I of diagram, output a set C of circles, a set L of lines, and a set P of points of interest contained in I.\nStep 1.1. [Recognize circles]\n1.1.1. [Preprocess] Perform graying and smoothing operations on the image I (using, e.g., the technique of Gaussian smoothing given in [30]) to obtain a new image I1.\n1.1.2. [Detect] Apply the gradient-based Hough transform (see algorithm 21HT in [27]) on I1 to acquire a set C of circles.\n1.1.3. [Refine] For each c := circle(O, r) in C, collect four points P1, P2, P3, and P4 on the left-bound, right-bound, top-bound, and bottom-bound of c respectively, and then replace O by the centroid of the quadrilateral P1P2P3P4 and r by the average of the Euclidean distances ‖OP1‖, ‖OP2‖, ‖OP3‖, and ‖OP4‖.\nStep 1.2. [Recognize lines] There are three possible defects in the lines detected from an image of diagram by applying Hough transform: (1) a line in the diagram is detected as some disconnected short segments; (2) the endpoints of a segment cannot be accurately detected; (3) some nonexisting segments may be detected on a circle, in particular when the radius of the circle is large. The following substeps are used to amend the defects.\n1.2.1. [Preprocess] Perform binarization and thinning operations on I (using, e.g., the technique in Zhang’s parallel thinning algorithm [28]) to obtain a new image I2 .\n1.2.2. [Detect] Apply the progressive probabilistic Hough transform (see [16])2 on I2 to acquire a set L of segments.\n1.2.3. [Merge segments] For each pair of segment(P1, P2) and segment(P3, P4) in L, if P1, P2, P3, and P4 are collinear and min1≤i 6=j≤4{‖PiPj‖} < τl (where τl is a prespecified tolerance), then the pair of segments is replaced by a new segment segment(P,Q) such that P,Q ∈ {P1, P2, P3, P4} and ‖PQ‖ = max1≤i,j≤4{‖PiPj‖}.\n1.2.4. [Determine endpoints] For each segment(P,Q) in L, if P and Q can be moved to points P ′ and Q′ outwards along the two directions of the segment respectively as far as there is no other point detected in I2, then replace segment(P,Q) by segment(P ′, Q′).\n1To allow use of previously retrieved information, recognition tasks are arranged in the order of circles, lines, and then points.\n2Both the gradient-based Hough transform and the progressive probabilistic Hough transform are improved versions of Hough transform: the former makes use of local gradients of the image intensity to reduce the computation time and is efficient for detecting circles, and the latter minimizes the amount of computation needed and is reliable for detecting lines. The two transforms have been implemented in OpenCV, an Open source Computer Vision and machine learning software library [34], to detect circles and lines respectively.\n1.2.5. [Remove nonexisting segments] For each pair of segment(P1, P2) ∈ L and circle(O, r) ∈ C, if |‖P1O‖ − r| < τc, |‖P2O‖ − r| < τc, and |‖P3O‖ − r| < τc, where τc is a prespecified tolerance and P3 is the midpoint of P1 and P2, then remove segment(P1, P2) from L.\n1.2.6. [Determine types of lines] A point with coordinates (x, y) is called a boundary point of the image I2, if 0 ≤ x < δ, or WI2 − δ ≤ x < WI2 , or 0 ≤ y < δ, or HI2 − δ ≤ y < HI2 .3 For each segment(P,Q) in L, if both P and Q are boundary points, then replace segment(P,Q) by line(P,Q); if P is a boundary point, but Q is not, then replace segment(P,Q) by halfline(P,Q); if Q is a boundary point, but P is not, then replace segment(P,Q) by halfline(Q,P ).\nStep 1.3. [Collect points of interest] The set P of points of interest are obtained as follows.\n• For each circle(O, r) in C, add O to P; for each circle(A,B,C) in C, add A, B, and C to P.\n• For each line(P,Q), or halfline(P,Q), or segment(P,Q) in L, add P and Q to P.\n• For each pair of lines in L, compute the numeric coordinates of the intersection point P of the two lines and add P to P, if P exists.\n• For each pair of a line in L and a circle in C, compute the numeric coordinates of the intersection points P1 and P2 of the line and the circle and add P1 and P2 to P, if P1 and P2 exist.\n• For each pair of circles in C, compute the numeric coordinates of the intersection points P1 and P2 of the two circles and add P1 and P2 to P, if P1 and P2 exist.\nDue to errors of numeric computation, the same point in the diagram may be collected into P more than once with different coordinates. Therefore, in the above process of adding a point P to P, the following substep need be performed to check whether P is already contained in P.\n1.3.1. [Identify identical points] For any given point P , if there exists a point P0 in P such that ‖PP0‖ < τp (where τp is a prespecified tolerance), then P and P0 are viewed as being identical and P need not be added to P.\nTo each of the recognized basic geometric objects, it is necessary to assign a unique label (or letter), so that geometric relations among the objects can be expressed clearly. Labels for important geometric objects (such as points) are usually contained in diagrams. We shall present a method to extract information on label assignment from images of diagrams in the next subsection.\n3Here WI2 denotes the width of I2, HI2 denotes the height of I2, and δ is a given tolerance."

      "text" : "Labels in an image of diagram may be recognized by checking whether each of them matches a character template, as shown in the following algorithm.\nAlgorithm 2 (Label recognition). Given an image I of diagram and the three sets C, L, and P obtained by applying Algorithm 1 to I, output a list L of labels in I and a list P of the corresponding centers of the regions where the labels occur in I.\nStep 2.1. [Prepare character templates] Produce a predetermined set T of binary images of letters with font type T commonly used in geometric documents as character templates.\nStep 2.2. [Preprocess] Redraw the points in P, the lines in L, and the circles in C on I with white (background) color. Perform graying and binarization operations on I to obtain a new image I3. Set L := [ ] and P := [ ].\nStep 2.3. [Cut out blocks with labels] For each label L, use an alterable rectangular cutting window W (l, r, t, b) to cut out from the image I3 a minimal block B containing the region where L occurs, where (l, t), (r, t), (l, b), and (r, b) denote, respectively, the left-top, right-top, left-bottom, and right-bottom vertices of the window. Cutting windows are determined as follows.\nLet HI3 and WI3 be the height and the width of I3, respectively. Set B, the set of image blocks with labels, to be empty. For each black (foreground color) pixel point P with coordinates (x, y) in I3, but not in any of the cutting windows for the image blocks in B, let h and w be initialized to y and x, respectively, and do the following. While 0 < h < HI3 and 0 < w < WI3 repeat:\n1. if the point (w, h+ 1) is a black pixel point, then set h := h+ 1;\n2. else if the point (w − 1, h + 1) is a black pixel point, then set w := w − 1 and h := h+ 1;\n3. else if the point (w + 1, h + 1) is a black pixel point, then set w := w + 1 and h := h+ 1;\n4. else if the point (w − 1, h) is a black pixel point, then set w := w − 1;\n5. otherwise, break.\nThen set δh := h − y and let l, r, t, b be initialized to x, x, y, y + δh, respectively. Decrease l by one each time until there is no black pixel point on segment((l, y), (l, y + δh)); decrease r by one each time until there is no black pixel point on segment((r, y), (r, y + δh)). In a similar way, t and b can be determined.\nFinally, use the obtained window W (l, r, t, b) to cut out B from the image4 and set B := B ∪ {B}.\nStep 2.4. [Match character templates] For each image block B in B, if there exists a character template T in T of letter L such that the similarity of T and B is not less than a threshold (e.g., 90 percent),5 then append L to the list L, compute the center ( l+r\n2 , t+b 2 ) of the cutting widow and append it to the list P. Note that the center of\nthe ith label in L corresponds to the ith point in P.\nTo assign the recognized labels to corresponding geometric objects, we adopt the following strategies according to the convention that in geometry, usually a letter in upper case is used to label its nearest point and a letter in lower case is used to label its nearest line. For the ith label Li in L, if Li is in upper case, then it is assigned to a point P in P such that for any other point P ′ ∈ P, ‖CiP‖ < ‖CiP ′‖, where Ci is the ith point in P; if Li is in lower case, then it is assigned to a line l in L such that for any other line l′ ∈ L, ‖Cil‖ < ‖Cil′‖.6\nFor any geometric object that is not labeled in the image, a unique label is automatically generated by our program to refer to the object. Taking the image of a diagram (Fig. 1) for Simson’s theorem7 as an example, we show the geometric objects obtained by Algorithm 1 and the labels recognized by Algorithm 2 or generated automatically.\n4To ensure successful determination of the size and position of the cutting window, we assume that labels have no overlap with geometric objects in the image.\n5The similarity of two images is defined as the ratio of the number of pixels at which the two images have the same binary values to the total number of pixels after scaling the two images to the same size.\n6The Euclidean distance from point P to line l is denoted by ‖Pl‖. 7Simson’s theorem may be stated as: the feet of the perpendiculars from a point to the sides of\na triangle are collinear if and only if the point lies on the circumcircle of the triangle.\n• The set P of points of interest:\nB := (45, 260), C := (351, 243), G := (313, 246), A := (137, 78),\nF := (262, 174), H := (311, 212), E := (163, 37), I := (182, 0),\nD := (305, 110), J := (196, 224), K := (184, 67), L := (224, 69).\n• The set L of lines: a := segment(B,C), b := segment(A,C), c := segment(E,G),\nd := halfline(B, I), e := segment(E,D), f := segment(D,G),\ng := segment(F,D).\n• The set C of circle: h := circle(J, 157).\nThe features of diagrams are depicted mainly via geometric relations (e.g., incidence, perpendicularity, and parallelism) among the involved objects. Geometric relations play a fundamental role in the specification of geometric knowledge (e.g., theorems). Based on retrieved information about geometric objects, we shall present a method to mine geometric relations in the next subsection."

      "text" : "Some geometric relations such as those listed in Table 1 may be taken as basic geometric relations because they can be used to describe most features about the size and position of geometric objects and from them many other geometric relations can be derived. For example, if point A is incident to line p and also to line q, then the two relations derive the new relation that A is the intersection point of the two lines p and q.\nEach basic geometric relation in Table 1 corresponds to an algebraic equality in the coordinates of the involved points and the radii of the involved circles. In general, a geometric relation can be certificated to be true if and only if its corresponding equality holds. Take incident(C, line(A,B)) as an example and let the coordinates of A, B, and C be (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), respectively. To determine whether C lies on line AB, one can check whether the value of the expression x1y2 + x2y3 + x3y1 − x1y3 − x2y1 − x3y2 is equal to 0. However, due to recognition and numeric errors, it is not effective to determine the equality by simply evaluating the expression, in particular when the slope of the line is large. We adopt some techniques to mine basic geometric relations as detailed in the following algorithm.\nAlgorithm 3 (Geometric relation mining). Given the set P of points of interest, the set L of lines, and the set C of circles recognized from an image of diagram with labels, output a set R of basic relations among the geometric objects.\nStep 3.1.

Such properties often hold generally for families of diagrams and may be stated as propositions. A geometric theorem is a true proposition about the implication of a geometric relation (called the conclusion of the theorem) in all the diagrams that satisfy the same set of geometric relations (called the hypothesis of the theorem). It is surprising that geometric theorems can be generated automatically and effectively from the information retrieved from images of diagrams in three steps: generating candidate propositions, ruling out false candidates, and proving the obtained theorems."

      "heading" : "3.1 Generating Candidates",
      "text" : "A candidate proposition is one that is likely a theorem. It can be generated in a simple way by selecting one (or more) geometric relation(s) as the conclusion and taking some other relations as the hypothesis. As there are geometric objects and relations which are irrelevant to the features of the diagram, it is necessary to remove such objects and relations for the efficiency of theorem mining from candidate propositions.\nUsually more points of interest than needed are recognized from the diagram. A point of interest is called a point of attraction if it is an endpoint of a segment, or the starting point of a half line, or the intersection point of two lines, or an intersection point of two circles or of one line and one circle, or the tangent point of two circles or of one line and one circle, or an isolated point. Points of attraction play an important role in forming the diagram. A point of attraction is called a characteristic point if it is used in the expressions of properties or the specifications of propositions implied in the diagram. For example, in the diagram shown in Fig. 2,10 I is a point of interest, but not a point of attraction; K L, H, and J are points of attraction, but\n10That the point I is truncated purposely in the figure is to show that I is on the boundary of the image.\nnot characteristic points because they are not used in the specification of Simson’s theorem that the diagram depicts.\nA geometric relation is said to be characteristic if all the points used in the relation are characteristic points. To generate candidate propositions for a diagram we are mainly concerned with characteristic points and relations. First of all, we introduce the following rule to remove irrelevant information retrieved.\nRule 1 (Remove irrelevant information). Remove from P points that are not characteristic and remove from R basic geometric relations that are not characteristic.\nThe following three strategies may be used to implement the above rule.\nStrategy 1 (Count weights of points). In general, characteristic points have labels assigned in the diagram. The more times a point is used in the retrieved geometric relations, the more likely it is to be characteristic.\nTo determine which points are potentially characteristic, we weight each point of interest by the number of its repeating occurrences in the retrieved relations. Table 2 shows the weights of the points of interest in Fig. 2 according to the retrieved basic geometric relations listed in the right column.\nStrategy 2 (Re-represent lines and circles). The weights of points of interest depend on the representations of lines in L and circles in C, while lines and circles may be represented in different ways. For example, in Fig. 2, the half line d can be represented as halfline(B,A) or halfline(B,E)\ninstead of halfline(B, I) because B, A, E, and I are all incident to d; the circle can be represented as circle(A,B,C) or circle(B,C,D) instead of circle(J, 157) because B, A, D, and C are all on the circle. It is therefore desirable to determine which representation is the best for ruling out the points that are not potentially characteristic. Generally speaking, among the points incident to a line or a circle, the higher weight a point has, the more possible it is to be characteristic. Therefore, we proceed as follows to re-represent geometric objects according to the weights of points.\nS2.1. [Re-represent lines] If P1, . . . , Pn are n (≥ 3) distinct points in P incident to a straight line, a segment, or a half line, then the straight line and the segment are represented as line(Pi, Pj) and segment(Pi, Pj) respectively, where Pi and Pj are two distinct points of the highest weights among P1, . . . , Pn; the half line is represented as halfline(B,Pi), where B is the starting point of the half line and Pi is the point of the highest weight among P1, . . . , Pn and is distinct from B.\nS2.2. [Re-represent circles] If P1, . . . , Pn are n (≥ 3) distinct points in P and on a circle, then the circle is represented as circle(Pi, Pj, Pk), where Pi, Pj, and Pk are three distinct points of the highest weights among P1, . . . , Pn. If\nthere exist other geometric relations with respect to the center of the circle, add two new geometric relations equal(distance(J, Pi), distance(J, Pj)) and equal(distance(J, Pi), distance(J, Pk)) to R, where J is the center of the circle.\nS2.3. [Re-count weights] At each time a geometric object is re-represented, the weights of the points of interest are re-counted.\nS2.4. [Remove trivial relations] After lines and circles are re-represented, remove all trivial relations in the form of incident(P, (P, ∗)), incident(P , (∗, P )), pointOnC(P, circle(P, ∗, ∗)), pointOnC(P, circle(∗, P, ∗)), and pointOnC(P, circle(∗, ∗, P )) from R (because they hold obviously), where can be line, segment, or halfline and ∗ can be any point in P1, . . . , Pn.\nTable 3 shows the weights of the points of interest and basic geometric relations for Fig. 2 after the re-representation process.\nStrategy 3 (Determine characteristic points and relations). After geometric objects are re-represented, the points of interest may be partially determined to be points of attraction or characteristic points according to their weights as follows.\nS3.1. [Determine points of attraction] If the weight of a point of interest is 0, then the point is not a point of attraction because it is not used in any geometric relation.\nS3.2. [Determine characteristic points] If the weight of a point P of interest is less than 3, then P could not potentially be a characteristic point because it is used at most in two geometric relations according to the weight counting. This can be explained as follows.\n• If P is the intersection point of two lines or an intersection point of one line and one circle, then no other geometric relations involve P and therefore P could not potentially be a characteristic point.\n• If P is an endpoint of only one segment l or the starting point of only one half line l, then no other lines or circles pass through P and there are at most two geometric relations which involve l. However, a nontrivial proposition usually needs at least two geometric relations that involve l in the hypothesis. Therefore, in this case, P could not potentially be a characteristic point.\n• If P is the common endpoint of two segments l1 and l2, then only one geometric relation involves l1 and only one geometric relation involves l2. Since a nontrivial proposition usually needs at least two geometric relations that involve the same line in the hypothesis, P could not potentially be a characteristic point in this case.\nFor example, the weights ofH, K, L, J , and I in Fig. 2 are 2, 2, 2, 0, and 0 respectively as shown in Table 3, so the points H, K, L, J , and I are not characteristic. Together with the non-characteristic relations, they are removed by Rule 1 (see Table 4).\nSome of the geometric relations in R may be derivable from other relations in R. We call geometric relations D1, . . . , Ds (1 ≤ s) branch relations with respect to other geometric relations H1, . . . , Hd (1 ≤ d) if D1, . . . , Ds can be easily derived from\nH1, . . . , Hd on a sub-diagram. The formula in the form of H1, . . . , Hd ⇒ D1, . . . , Ds is used to represent that the branch relations D1, . . . , Ds are obtained from H1, . . . , Hd.\nIn Fig. 3 (a sub-diagram for Butterfly theorem), C is the midpoint of segment AB and segment DE. Then the following four relations can be obtained: (1) ‖AC‖ = ‖CB‖; (2) ‖DC‖ = ‖CE‖; (3) ‖AD‖ = ‖EB‖; (4) ‖AE‖ = ‖DB‖. It is easy to see that (1), (2)⇒ (3), (4); (1), (3)⇒ (2), (4); (1), (4)⇒ (2), (3).\nSimilarly, in Fig. 4 (a diagram for Steiner’s theorem), segment BD and segment CE are internal bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠BCA respectively and F is the intersection point of BD and CE. Then the following relations can be obtained: (1) ‖AB‖ = ‖AC‖; (2) ‖BD‖ = ‖CE‖; (3) ‖AE‖ = ‖AD‖; (4) ‖BE‖ = ‖CD‖. One sees that (1), (2)⇒ (3), (4); (1), (3)⇒ (2), (4); (1), (4)⇒ (2), (3).\nBranch relations are usually not used in theorems about the features of the whole diagram. Therefore, we introduce the following rule.\nRule 2 (Remove branch relations). If R1, . . . , Rk ⇒ Rk+1, . . . , Rm (1 ≤ k < m and R1, . . . , Rm are all basic geometric relations in R), then remove Rk+1, . . . , Rm from R.\nFigure 3: Distance relations on the same line\nFigure 4: Distance relations on different lines\nThere may be different branch relations in the same set of geometric relations (see, e.g., Figs. 3 and 4). The following strategy may be used to select appropriate branch relations.\nStrategy 4 (Determine branch relations). Let E be the set of distance relations in R.\nS4.1. In the case when all the points used in distance relations lie on the same line (see Fig. 3), sort the points in ascending order of x-coordinate or y-coordinate to obtain a list [P1, . . . , Pn]. Then branch relations are obtained from the following formulae:\n1. ‖PiPj‖ = ‖PkPl‖ ⇒ ‖PiPk| = ‖PjPl‖;\n2. ‖PiPm‖ = ‖PmPl‖, ‖PjPm‖ = ‖PmPk‖ ⇒ ‖PiPj‖ = ‖PkPl‖, ‖PiPk‖ = ‖PjPl‖,11\nwhere 1 ≤ i < j < m < k < l ≤ n.\nS4.2. In the case when some points used in distance relations lie on different lines (see Fig. 4), form a new set E1 of distance equations from E such that the used points are parameters of some retrieved lines. Then branch relations are obtained from the formula\n‖AB‖ = ‖CD‖, ‖AE‖ = ‖FD‖ ⇒ ‖BE‖ = ‖CF‖ (1) such that ‖AB‖ = ‖CD‖ and ‖AE‖ = ‖FD‖ are both in E1, but ‖BE‖ = ‖CF‖ is not in E1. Let E2 be the set of all the obtained branch relations. For each pair of E1 ∈ E1 and E2 ∈ E2, a new branch relation E3 with respect to E1 and E2 is determined also by the formula (1) if E3 is not in E1.\nS4.3. In particular, the distance between the center of a circle and any point on the circle is constant. Therefore, branch relations can be determined from the formula\npointOnC(A, circle(O, r)), pointOnC(B, circle(O, r))⇒ ‖OA‖ = ‖OB‖.\nAs discussed in Section 2.3, retrieved geometric relations in R are basic and from them other new geometric relations can be derived. A geometric relation R is called a derived relation if it is implied by the basic geometric relations R1, . . . , Rm (2 ≤ m). The formula R1, . . . , Rm 7→ R is used to represent that R can be obtained from R1, . . . , Rm.\nRule 3 (Introduce derived relations). If R1, . . . , Rm 7→ R and for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Ri ∈ R and R /∈ R, then remove R1, . . . , Rm from R and add R to R.\nStrategy 5 (Introduce new geometric objects). Derived relations can be obtained from the following formulae:\n1. incident(C, p), incident(C, q) 7→ C := intersection(p, q);12\n2. incident(C, segment(A,B)), AC = CB 7→ C := midpoint(A,B);13\n3. incident(C, p), perpendicular(p, q) 7→ C := foot(p, q).14\nFor example, from the relations in Table 4 and by Rule 3 one can obtain the derived geometric relations listed in Table 5.\n11A distance relation of the form ‖A1A2‖ = ‖A3A4‖ can be replaced by ‖A1A2‖ = ‖A4A3‖, ‖A2A1‖ = ‖A3A4‖, or ‖A2A1‖ = ‖A4A3‖.\n12A geometric relation of the form L := f(p1, p2, . . . , pn) means that L is the label for the geometric object f(p1, p2, . . . , pn) and intersection(p, q) denotes the intersection point of p and q.\n13midpoint(A,B) denotes the midpoint of segment AB. 14perpendicular(p, q) can be replaced by perpendicular(q, p) and foot(p, q) denotes the foot of\ntwo lines p and q perpendicular to each other.\nStrategy 6 (Generate candidate propositions). To formulate a proposition, one needs to determine which geometric relations can be taken as the hypothesis, in which order the relations are introduced in the hypothesis, and which one can be taken as the conclusion.\nWe first introduce an order ≺ on the characteristic points P1, . . . , Pn according to the following two rules.\n1. If Pi is the label for a derived relation, then Pj ≺ Pi, where Pj is used in the relation and Pj 6= Pi.\n2. Otherwise, if the weight of Pi is higher than that of Pj, then Pi ≺ Pj.\nFor example, according to the weights of the characteristic points in Table 4 and the representations of the characteristic relations in Table 5, an order of the characteristic points is C ≺ A ≺ B ≺ D ≺ G ≺ E ≺ F .\nBased on the order ≺ of points, an order l is induced on characteristic relations (after the above-stated rules have been applied)\nR1[P11, . . . , P1k1 ], R2[P21, . . . , P2k2 ], . . . , Rm[Pm1, . . . , Pmkm ],\nwhere Pi1, . . . , Piki are ki points used in Ri (1 ≤ i ≤ m) such that Pi1 ≺ · · · ≺ Piki , according to the following three rules.\n1. If Pi1 ≺ Pj1, then Ri[Pi1, . . . , Piki ] lRj[Pj1, . . . , Pjkj ].\n2. If there exists a w (1 ≤ w < min{ki, kj}) such that for all t (1 ≤ t ≤ w) Pit is identical to Pjt and Pi(w+1) ≺ Pj(w+1), then Ri[Pi1, . . . , Piki ] lRj[Pj1, . . . , Pjkj ].\n3. Suppose that ki ≤ kj. If for all t (1 ≤ t ≤ ki) Pit is identical to Pjt, then Ri[Pi1, . . . , Piki ] lRj[Pj1, . . . , Pjkj ].\nThe characteristic relations listed in Table 5 are ordered by l as: incident(D, circle(A,B,C)) l F := foot(segment(A,C), segment(D,F ))\nl G := foot(segment(B,C), segment(D,G)) l E := foot(halfline(B,A), segment(D,E)) l incident(F, segment(E,G)).\nGiven R1lR2l· · ·lRm, the hypothesis and conclusion of a candidate proposition are generated according to the following three rules.\n1. Any basic relation Ri can be taken as the conclusion.\n2. If Ri and Rj are both derived relations with the same label, then either Ri or Rj can be taken as the conclusion.\n3. The geometric relations other than the conclusion may be taken as the hypothesis.\nThe generated candidate propositions may be represented in the following form: Proposition(Tk, [R1, . . . , Rk−1, Rk+1, . . . , Rm], [Rk]), where 1 ≤ k ≤ m, Tk is the name, R1, . . . , Rk−1, Rk+1, . . . , Rm the hypothesis, and Rk the conclusion of the proposition.\nFor example, two candidate propositions may be generated for the diagram in Fig. 1:\nProposition(Simson5, [incident(D, circle(A,B,C)), F := foot(halfline(A,\nC), segment(D,F )), G := foot(segment(B,C), segment(D,G)), E :=\nfoot(segment(B,A), segment(D,E))], [incident(F, segment(E,G))])\nand\nProposition(Simson1, [F := foot(halfline(A,C), segment(D,F )), G := foot\n(segment(B,C), segment(D,G)), E := foot(segment(B,A), segment(D,\nE)), incident(F, segment(E,G))], [incident(D, circle(A,B,C))])."

For the efficiency of theorem mining, false propositions need be ruled out first, so that each proposition submitted to a theorem prover is a potential theorem.\nA counterexample of a proposition is a diagram for which the hypothesis of the proposition holds, but the conclusion of the proposition does not. If a counterexample can be found, then the proposition must not be a theorem.

Such algebraic nondegeneracy conditions may be translated back into geometric form (see [32]). There are inequality conditions which are not necessarily connected to nondegeneracy.

      "text" : "The effectiveness of the approach we have proposed for automated generation of geometric theorems from images of diagrams depends on the completeness and accuracy of the information retrieved as well as the capability and efficiency of the theorem prover used. In this section we present some experimental results with a preliminary implementation of the approach.\n15Wu’s method is complete for proving geometric theorems involving equalities only.\nThe algorithms described in Section 2 have been implemented in C++. Images of diagrams for testing and character templates were prepared by using GeoGebra [31] which is a dynamic geometry software system for interactive construction of diagrams, annotation of labels for geometric objects, and exportation of images. Circles and lines are detected from the images of diagrams by using functions cvHoughCircles and cvHoughLines2 provided in OpenCV.\nEight parameters τl, τc, δ, τp, τpl, τpc, τd, τa are used to specify tolerances in our approach for retrieving geometric information from images of diagrams. We firstly acquire empirical values τl, . . . , τa for τl, . . . , τa by making experiments on a set of test images with fixed size 400 × 400. Then, for any given image I of diagram, the tolerances will be automatically adjusted according to the size of I. For example, if the size of I is W × H, then τc will be reset to τc min(W,H)/400 as τc is used to determine the equality of Euclidean distances. The parameters τl, τp, δ, τpl, τpc, τd will be reset similarly, while τa will remain to be τa because τa is used to determine the equality of angles which are not affected by image scaling.\nThe strategies presented in Section 3.1 for automated generation of candidate propositions have been implemented in Java. As the computation of characteristic sets and irreducible triangular decomposition needed in the process of geometric theorem mining and proving are sophisticated and expensive symbolic computation processes, we choose to use Epsilon [29] for the involved polynomial elimination, triangularization, and decomposition and GEOTHER [32] for automated algebraization and proof of geometric theorems and automated interpretation of algebraic nondegeneracy conditions. An interface for transforming the specifications of candidate propositions into the native representations of GEOTHER has been developed.\nTo test our approach, we have made experiments on the images of diagrams shown in Table 6.16 The diagrams used for the experiments were selected from [25], provided that the theorems they illustrate can be expressed by using only the basic geometric relations listed in Table 1. Different diagrams may involve different types of basic relations. For example, the diagrams with Nos. 1 and 2 only involve “onLine” relations; the diagrams with Nos. 3, 4, and 5 involve both “onLine” and “dEqual” relations; the diagram with No. 6 involves both “onLine” and “Perp” relations. It is easy to figure out from the results of test on the diagrams the capability of the current implementation of our approach. In Table 6, “Undesired” denotes the number of undesired geometric relations (e.g., those relations which hold occasionally in the input diagram, but do not hold in other diagrams for the same theorem); “Time” is recorded in seconds for information retrieval from the image;17 “Candidates” denotes\n16The theorems generated automatically from images of diagrams are presented on the website http://geo.cc4cm.org/data/recognizer/.\n17The programs for information retrieval are run on a machine with 1.86GHz CPU and 1.24G of memory.\nthe number of generated candidate propositions; and “Theorems” denotes the number of proved theorems.\nTable 6: Test results No. Image Undesired Time Candidates Theorems\n8 0 0.187 7 4\n9 0 0.124 8 7\n10 0 0.187 9 0\n9-11 0 0.14 5 5\n12 0 0.156 42 1\n13 1 0.249 8 8\n14 0 0.171 6 4\nTable 6: Test results No. Image Undesired Time Candidates Theorems\n15 0 0.2 2 2\n16 0 0.171 2 2\n17 0 0.187 4 4\n18 1 0.281 7 7\n19 10 0.312 3 3\n20 4 0.312 7 6\n21 11 0.451 10 0\nTable 6: Test results No. Image Undesired Time Candidates Theorems\n22 5 0.219 8 0\n23 27 0.453 9 0\nIn the test results, some undesired distance relations (such as ‖AI‖ = ‖JM‖ for the diagram image of the nine-point circle theorem with No. 18 and ‖FI‖ = ‖CH‖ for that of Pappus’ theorem with No. 1) are retrieved due to insufficient accuracy of geometric object recognition under large error tolerance. Generally speaking, over-strict error tolerance may lead to the missing of useful geometric relations for theorems that should be discovered, while under-strict error tolerance may bring some spurious geometric relations. Appropriate trade-off in the selection of error tolerances for different images can help improve the completeness and accuracy of geometric information retrieval.\nFor some images of diagrams (such as the image for Thébault’s theorem with No. 12), the number of generated candidate propositions is big because some branch relations (e.g., ‖AC‖ = ‖CE‖, ‖AC‖ = ‖AE‖ ⇒ ‖AE‖ = ‖CE‖) are not ruled out. For some other images of diagrams (such as the image for Morley’s theorem with No. 10 and that for Newton’s theorem with No. 22), though candidate propositions are generated successfully, the desired theorems cannot be proved by using algebraic methods. This failure of theorem proving is mainly for the following reasons.\n• The automatically generated specifications of candidate propositions are not appropriate enough. For example, one of the generated candidate propositions for the image with No. 10 is Proposition(Morley1, [‖EF‖ = ‖DE‖, ∠ABE = ∠EBD, ∠EBD = ∠DBC, ∠FAE = ∠EAB, ∠CAF = ∠FAE, ∠BCD = ∠DCF , ∠DCF = ∠FCA, ‖DF‖ = ‖EF‖], [‖DF‖ = ‖DE‖]) in which only one relation is selected for the conclusion. The proposition should have been proved to be true because it is obvious that ‖EF‖ = ‖DE‖ and ‖DF‖ = ‖EF‖ imply ‖DF‖ = ‖DE‖. However, symbolic computation with the algebraic relations expressing the hypothesis is so complicated that makes the program run out of memory. The candidate proposition fails to be a theorem because of inappropriate selection of relations for the hypothesis as well as the conclusion.\n• The functions in GEOTHER we have used for automatic assignment of\ncoordinates to points and ordering of variables are not well optimized.\nThus the resulting algebraic expressions are much more complicated than what could be produced with human optimization, so the involved algebraic computations are made more complex as well."

Some of them have improved the performance of the traditional Hough transform by exploiting gradient information [12] or using more effective voting schemes [11]. Besides Hough transform, random algorithms for the detection of lines and circles have been proposed in [4, 5]. Those algorithms save a certain amount of storage space by first randomly computing a candidate line or circle and then performing an evidence collecting process to further determine whether the line or circle actually exists. Note that most of the shape detection methods are used to extract rough shapes of objects’ edges from general images. Their accuracy of recognition is not required to be very high. For our purpose of recognizing geometric objects, it is crucial to use OpenCV with numeric data (such as the coordinates of points) to ensure that the accuracy of the detection results is sufficiently high, so that geometric relations implied in images of diagrams can be correctly determined through numeric computation."

The success of our approach demonstrates the feasibility of automatically acquiring formalized geometric knowledge in quantity from a large scale of images of diagrams available in electronic documents and resources and of efficiently managing such knowledge in a retrievable structure with diagrams instead of ambiguous statements in natural languages.\nOur work is still ongoing. More experiments are being carried out and more techniques and strategies are being developed to improve the accuracy of retrieving geometric information from images of diagrams and of ruling out branch relations and introducing derived relations, to generate appropriate specifications of candidate propositions heuristically, and to enhance the efficiency of geometric theorem proving with optimal assignment of coordinates to points.\nCurrently, the images for experiments are produced from accurate diagrams drawn by using dynamic geometry software. We will extend our approach to deal with scanned and photographed images of hand-drawn diagrams in which the implied geometric relations are inexact. In this case, the retrieval of geometric information becomes more difficult and requires more specialized techniques.
