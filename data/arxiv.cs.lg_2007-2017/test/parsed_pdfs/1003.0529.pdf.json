      "text" : "Multidimensional scaling (MDS) [23, 10, 3] is a widely used method for embedding a general distance matrix into a low dimensional Euclidean space, used both as a preprocessing step for many problems, as well as a visualization tool in its own right. MDS has been studied and used in psychology since the 1930s [35, 33, 22] to help visualize and analyze data sets where the only input is a distance matrix. More recently MDS has become a standard dimensionality reduction and embedding technique to manage the complexity of dealing with large high dimensional data sets [8, 9, 31, 6].\nIn general, the problem of embedding an arbitrary distance matrix into a fixed dimensional Euclidean space with minimum error is nonconvex (because of the dimensionality constraint). Thus, in addition to the standard formulation [12], many variants of MDS have been proposed, based on changing the underlying error function [35, 8]. There are also applications where the target space, rather than being a Euclidean space, is a manifold (e.g. a low dimensional sphere), and various heuristics for MDS in this setting have also been proposed [13, 6].\nEach such variant is typically addressed by a different heuristic, including majorization, the singular value decomposition, semidefinite programming, subgradient methods, and standard Lagrange-multipler-based methods (in both primal and dual settings). Some of these heuristics are efficient, and others are not; in general, every new variant of MDS seems to require different ideas for efficient heuristics."

Our approach is based on an iterative local improvement method, and can be summarized as follows: “Pick a point and move it so that the cost function is locally optimal. Repeat this process until convergence.” The improvement step reduces to a well-studied and efficient family of iterative minimization techniques, where the specific algorithm depends on the variant of MDS.\nA central result of this paper is a single general convergence result for all variants of MDS that we examine.

Our approach is generic, efficient, and simple. The high level framework can be written in 10-12 lines of MATLAB code, with individual functionspecific subroutines needing only a few more lines each. Further, our approach compares well with the best methods for all the variants of MDS. In each case our method is consistently either the best performer or is close to the best, regardless of the data profile or cost function used, while other approaches have much more variable performance. Another useful feature of our method is that it is parameter-free, requiring no tuning parameters or Lagrange multipliers in order to perform at its best.\nSpherical MDS. An important application of our approach is the problem of performing spherical MDS. Spherical MDS is the problem of embedding a matrix of distances onto a (low-dimensional) sphere. Spherical MDS has applications in texture mapping and image analysis [6], and is a generalization of the spherical dimensionality reduction problem, where the goal is to map points from a high dimensional sphere onto a lowdimensional sphere. This latter problem is closely related to dimensionality reduction for finite dimensional distributions. A well-known isometric embedding takes a distribution represented as a point on the d-dimensional simplex to the d-dimensional sphere while preserving the Hellinger distance between distributions. A spherical dimensionality reduction result is an important step to representing high dimensional distributions in a lowerdimensional space of distributions, and will have considerable impact in domains that represent data natively as histograms or distributions, such as in document processing [29, 18, 2], image analysis [25, 11] and speech recognition [16].\nOur above framework applies directly to this setting, where for the local improvement step we adapt a technique first developed by Karcher for finding geodesic means on a manifold. In addition, we prove a Johnson-Lindenstrauss-type result for the sphere; namely, that n points lying on a d-dimensional sphere can be embedded on a O((1/\"2) log n)-dimensional sphere while approximately preserving the geodesic distances between pairs of points, that is, no distance changes by more than a relative (1+ \")-factor. This latter result can be seen as complementary to the local improvement scheme; the formal embedding result guarantees the error while being forced to use log n dimensions, while the local improvement strategy generates a mapping into any k dimensional hypersphere but provides no formal guarantees on the error.\nSummary of contributions. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n• In Section 4 we present our iterative framework, illustrate how it is applied to specific MDS variants and prove a convergence result.\n• In Section 5 we present a comprehensive experimental study that compares our approach to the prior best known methods for different MDS variants.\n• In Section 6 we prove a formal dimensionality reduction result that embeds a set of n points on a highdimensional sphere into a sphere of dimension O((1/\"2) log n) while preserving all distances to within relative error of (1+ \") for any \" > 0."

      "text" : "Multidimensional scaling is a family of methods for embedding a distance matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. There is a general taxonomy of MDS methods [10]; in this paper we will focus primarily the metric and generalized MDS problems.\nThe traditional formulation of MDS [23] assumes that the distance matrix D arises from points in some ddimensional Euclidean space. Under this assumption, a simple transformation takes D to a matrix of similarities S, where si j = 〈x i , x j〉. These similarities also arise from many psychology data sets directly [33, 35]. The\nproblem then reduces to finding a set of points X in k-dimensional space such that X X T approximates S. This can be done optimally using the top k singular values and vectors from the singular value decomposition of S.\nA more general approach called SMACOF that drops the Euclidean assumption uses a technique known as stress majorization [27, 12, 13]. It has been adapted to many other MDS variants as well including restrictions of data to lie on quadratic surfaces and specifically spheres [13].\nSince the sum-of-squares error metric is sensitive to outliers, Cayton and Dasgupta [8] proposed a robust variant based on an `1 error metric. They separate the rank and cost constraints, solving the latter using either semidefinite programming or a subgradient heuristic, followed by a singular value decomposition to enforce the rank constraints.\nMany techniques have been proposed for performing spherical MDS. Among them are majorization methods ([30] and SMACOF-Q [13]), a multiresolution approach due to Elad, Keller, and Kimmel [14] and an approach based on computing the classical MDS and renormalizing [31].\nEmbeddings that guarantee bounded error. A complementary line of work in dimensionality reduction fixes an error bound for every pair of distances (rather than computing an average error), and asks for the minimum dimension a data set can be embedded in while maintaining this error. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma [19] states that any collection of n points in a Euclidean space can be embedded in a O((1/\"2) log n) dimensional Euclidean space that preserves all distances within a relative error of \". If the points instead define an abstract metric space, then the best possible result is an embedding into O(log n)-dimensional Euclidean space that preserves distances up to a factor of O(log n). An exhaustive survey of the different methods for dimensionality reduction is beyond the scope of this paper - the reader is directed to the survey by Indyk and Matousek for more information [17].\nThe Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma can be extended to data lying on manifolds. Any manifold M with “linearization dimension” k (a measure of its complexity) can be embedded into a O((1/\"2)k log(kn)) dimensional space so that all pairwise Euclidean distances between points on M are distorted by at most a relative (1+ \")- factor [1, 32, 26]. A k-dimensional sphere has linearization dimension O(k), so this bound applies directly for preserving the chordal (i.e. Euclidean) distance between points on a sphere. The geodesic distance between points on a sphere can be interpreted as the angle between the points in radians, and a result by Magen [26] show that O((1/\"2) log n) dimensions preserve angles to within a relative factor of 1+ p \" (which is weaker than our result preserving the geodesic distance to within a relative factor of (1+ \"))."

The multidimensional scaling problem takes as input Y , D and k, and asks for a mapping µ : Y → X from Y to a set of points X in a k-dimensional space T such that the difference between the original and resulting distances is minimized.\nThere are many different ways to measure the difference between the sets of distances, and these can be captured by the following general function\nC(X , D) = ∑\ni\n∑\nj\nErr( f (x i , x j)− di j)\nwhere Err measures the discrepancy between the source and target distances, and f denotes the function that measures distance in the target space.\n• T = Rk,Err(δ) = δ2, f (x , x ′) = ‖x − x ′‖2: This is a general form of the MDS problem, which we refer to as fMDS.\n• T = Rk,Err(δ) = |δ|, f (x , x ′) = ‖x − x ′‖2: This is a robust variant of MDS called rMDS, first suggested by Cayton and Dasgupta [8].\n• T = S ¯ k,Err(δ) = |δ| or δ2, f (x , x ′) is either chordal (c) or geodesic distance (g) on S ¯ k.

It is a variant which takes the absolute difference of the squared distance matrices. We call this measure r2MDS.

The cost function can be expressed as a sum of costs for each point x i , and so in each step of the inner loop we find the best placement for x i while keeping all other points fixed, using the algorithm PLACEi(X , D). A key insight driving our approach is that PLACEi(X , D) can be implemented either iteratively or exactly for a wide class of distance functions. The process terminates when over all i, invoking PLACEi(X , D) does not reduce the cost C(X , D) by more than a threshold t. The algorithm takes O(n2) for each iteration, since PLACEi(X , D) will take O(n) time and computing C(X , D) takes O(n2) time.\n4.1 A Geometric Perspective On Placei(X , D)\nThe routine PLACEi(X , D) is the heart of our algorithm. This routine finds the optimal placement of a fixed point x i with respect to the cost function Ci(X , D, x i) = ∑\nj Err( f (x i , x j)− di j). Set r j = di j . Then the optimal placement of x i is given by the point x ∗ minimizing the function\ng(x) = ∑\nj\nErr( f (x , x j)− r j).\nNote that the terms f (x , x i) and ri = dii are zero, so we can ignore their presence in the summation for ease of notation.\nThere is a natural geometric interpretation of g(x), illustrated in Figure 1. Consider a sphere around the point x j of radius r j . Let x̂ j be the point on this sphere that intersects the ray from x j towards x . Then the distance f (x , x̂ j) = | f (x , x j)− r j|. Thus, we can rewrite g(x) as\ng(x) = ∑\nj\nErr( f (x , x̂ j)).\nThis function is well-known in combinatorial optimization as the min-sum problem. For Err(δ) = δ2, g(x) finds the point minimizing the sum-of-squared distances from a collection of fixed points (the 1-mean), which is the centroid x∗ = 1\nn\n∑\nj x̂ j . For Err(δ) = |δ|, g(x) finds the 1-median, the point minimizing the sum of distances from a collection of fixed points. Although there is no closed form expression for the 1-median, there are numerous algorithms for solving this problem both exactly [34] and approximately [4]. Methods that converge to the global optimum exist for any Err(δ) = |δ|p, p ≤ 2; it is known that if p is sufficiently larger than 2, then convergent methods may not exist [5].\nWhile g(x) can be minimized optimally for error functions Err of interest, the location of the points x̂ j depends on the location of the solution x∗, which is itself unknown! This motivates an alternating optimization procedure, where the current iterate x is used to compute x̂ j , and then these x̂ j are used as input to the min-sum problem to solve for the next value of x .\nAlgorithm 2 PLACEi(X , D) repeat \"← g(x i) for j = 1 to n do\nx̂ j ← intersection of sphere of radius r j around x j with ray from x j towards x i end for x i ← RECENTER({ x̂1, x̂2, . . . , x̂n})\nuntil (\"− g(x i)< t) {for a fixed threshold t} return x i"

In fact, all the domain-specificity of the method appears in RECENTER, which solves the min-sum\nproblem. We now demonstrate how different implementations of RECENTER allow us to solve the different variants of MDS discussed above.\n4.2.1 The original MDS: fMDS\nRecall from Section 3 that the fMDS problem is defined by Err(δ) = δ2 and f (x , x ′) = ‖x − x ′‖2. Thus, g(x) = ∑\nj ‖x− x̂ j‖ 2. As mentioned earlier, the minimum of this function is attained at x∗ = (1/n)\n∑\nj x̂ j . Thus, RECENTER({ x̂1, x̂2, . . . , x̂n}) merely outputs (1/n) ∑ j x̂ j , and takes O(n) time per invocation.\n4.2.2 Robust MDS: rMDS\nThe robust MDS problem rMDS is defined by Err(δ) = |δ| and f (x , x ′) = ‖x − x ′‖2. Minimizing the resulting function g(x) yields the famous Fermat-Weber problem, or the 1-median problem as it is commonly known. An exact iterative algorithm for solving this problem was given by Weiszfeld [34], and works as follows. At each step of PLACEi the value x i is updated by\nx i ← ∑\nj\nx̂ j ‖x i − x̂ j‖\n,\n∑\nj\n1\n‖x i − x̂ j‖ .\nThis algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution [24, 28], and in most settings converges quadratically [21].\nOther norms and distances. If Err(δ) = |δ|p, 1 < p < 2, then an iterative algorithm along the same lines as the Weiszfeld algorithm can be used to minimize g(x) optimally [5]. In practice, this is the most interesting range of values for p. It is also known that for p sufficiently larger than 2, this iterative scheme may not converge.\nWe also can tune PLACECENTER to the r2MDS problem (using squared distances) by setting r j = d2i j ."

      "text" : "Spherical MDS poses special challenges for the implementation of RECENTER. Firstly, it is no longer obvious what the definition of x̂ j should be, since the “spheres” surrounding points must also lie on the sphere. Secondly, consider the case where Err(δ) = δ2, and f (x , x ′) is given by geodesic distance on the sphere. Unlike in the case of Rk, we no longer can solve for the minimizer of g(x) by computing the centroid of the given points, because this centroid will not in general lie on the sphere, and even computing the centroid followed by a projection onto the sphere will not guarantee optimality.\nThe first problem can be solved easily. Rather than draw spheres around each x j , we draw geodesic spheres, which are the set of points at a fixed geodesic distance from x j . On the sphere, this set of points can be easily described as the intersection of an appropriately chosen halfplane with the sphere. Next, instead of computing the intersection of this geodesic sphere with the ray from x j towards the current estimate of x i , we compute the intersection with a geodesic ray from x j towards x i .\nThe second problem can be addressed by prior work on computing min-sums on manifolds. Karcher [20] proposed an iterative scheme for the geodesic sum-of-squares problem that always converges as long as the points do not span the entire sphere. His work extends (for the same functions Err, f ) to points defined on more general Riemannian manifolds satisfying certain technical conditions. It runs in O(n) time per iteration.\nFor the robust case (Err(δ) = |δ|), the Karcher scheme no longer works. For this case, we make use of a Weiszfeld-like adaption [15] that again works on general Riemannian manifolds, and on the sphere in particular. Like the Weiszfeld scheme, this approach takes O(n) time per iteration."

      "heading" : "5 Experiments",
      "text" : "In this section we evaluate the performance of PLACECENTER (PC). Since PC generalizes to many different cost functions, we compare it with the best known algorithm for each cost function, if one exists. For the fMDS problem the leading algorithm is SMACOF [13]; for the r2MDS problem the leading algorithm is by Cayton and Dasgupta (CD) [8]. We know of no previous scalable algorithm designed for rMDS. We note that the Cayton-Dasgupta algorithm REE does not exactly solve the r2MDS problem. Instead, it takes a non-Euclidean distance matrix and finds a Euclidean distance matrix that minimizes the error without any rank restrictions. Thus, as suggested by the authors [8], to properly compare the algorithms, we let CD refer to running REE and then projecting the result to a k-dimensional subspace using the SVD technique [35] (our plots show this projection after each step). With regards to each of these Euclidean measures we compare our algorithm with SMACOF and CD. We also compare with the popular SVD-based method [35], which solves the related cMDS problem based on similarities, by seeding all three iterative techniques with the results of the closed-form SVD-based solution.\nThen we consider the family of spherical MDS problems {c,g}-{1,2}-sMDS. We compare against a version of SMACOF-Q [13] that is designed for data restricted to a low dimensional sphere, specifically for the c-2SMDS measure. We compare this algorithm to ours under the c-2-SMDS measure (for a fair comparison with SMACOF-Q) and under the g-1-SMDS measure which is the most robust to noise.\nThe subsections that follow focus on individual cost measures. We then discuss the overall behavior of our algorithm in Section 5.5.\nData sets, code, and setup. Test inputs for the algorithms are generated as follows. We start with input consisting of a random point set with n = 300 points in R\n¯ d for d = 200, with the target space T = R ¯ k with\nk = 10. Many data sets in practice have much larger parameters n and d, but we limit ourselves to this range because for larger values CD becomes prohibitively slow. The data is generated to first lie on a k-dimensional subspace, and then (full-dimensional) Poisson noise is applied to all points up to a magnitude of 30% of the variation in any dimension. Finally, we construct the Euclidean distance matrix D which is provided as input to the algorithms.\nThese data sets are Euclidean, but “close” to k-dimensional. To examine the behavior of the algorithms on distance matrices that are non-Euclidean, we generate data as before in a k-dimensional subspace and generate the resulting distance matrix D. Then we perturb a fraction of the elements of D (rather than perturbing the points) with Poisson noise. The fraction perturbed varies in the set (2%, 10%,30%, 90%).\nAll algorithms were implemented in MATLAB. For SMACOF, we used the implementation provided by Bronstein [7], and built our own implementation of SMACOF-Q around it. For all other algorithms, we used our own implementation1. In all cases, we compare performance in terms of the error function Err as a function of clock time.\n5.1 The rMDS Problem\nFigure 2(a) shows the cost function Err associated with rMDS plotted with respect to runtime. PLACECENTER always reaches the best local minimum, partially because only PLACECENTER can be adjusted for the rMDS problem. We also observe that the runtime is comparable to SMACOF and much faster than CD in order to get to the same Err value. Although SMACOF initially reaches a smaller cost that PC, it later converges to a larger cost because it optimizes a different cost function (fMDS).\nWe repeat this experiment in Figure 2(b) for different values of k (equal to {2,20, 50,150}) to analyze the performance as a function of k. Note that PC performs even better for lower k in relation to CD. This is likely as a result of CD’s reliance on the SVD technique to reduce the dimension. At smaller k, the SVD technique has a tougher job to do, and optimizes the wrong metric. Also for k = 150 note that CD oscillates in its cost; this is again because the REE part finds a nearby Euclidean distance matrix which may be inherently very high dimensional and the SVD projection is very susceptible to changes in this matrix for such large k. We observe that SMACOF is the fastest method to reach a low cost, but does not converge to the lowest cost value. The reason it achieves a cost close to that of PC is that for this type of data the rMDS and fMDS cost functions are fairly similar.\nIn Figure 3 we evaluate the effect of changing the amount of noise added to the input distance matrix D, as described above. We consider two variants of the CD algorithm, one where it is seeded with an SVD-based seed (marked CD+SVD) and one where it is seeded with a random projection to a k-dimensional subspace (marked CD+rand). In both cases the plots show the results of the REE algorithm after SVD-type projections back to a k-dimensional space.\nThe CD+SVD technique consistently behaves poorly and does not improve with further iterations. This probably is because the REE component finds the closest Euclidean distance matrix which may correspond to points in a much high dimensional space, after which it is difficult for the SVD to help. The CD+rand\n1All of our code may be found at http://www.cs.utah.edu/~arvind/smds.html.\napproach does much better, likely because the random projection initializes the procedure in a reasonably low dimensional space so REE can find a relatively low dimension Euclidean distance matrix that is nearby. SMACOF is again the fastest algorithm, but with more noise, the difference between fMDS and rMDS is larger, and thus SMACOF converges to a configuration with much higher cost than PC. We reiterate that PC consistently converges to the lowest cost solution among the different methods, and consistently is either the fastest or is comparable to the fastest algorithm. We will see this trend repeated with other cost measures as well.\n5.2 The fMDS Problem\nWe next evaluate the algorithms PC, SMACOF, and CD under the fMDS distance measure. The results are very similar to the rMDS case except now both SMACOF and PC are optimizing the correct distance measure and converge to the same local minimum. SMACOF is still slightly faster that PC, but since they both run very fast, the difference is of the order of less than a second even in the very worst part of the cost/time tradeoff curve shown in Figure 4(a). Note that CD performs poorly under this cost function here except when k = 50. For smaller values of k, the SVD step does not optimize the correct distance and for larger k the REE part is likely finding an inherently very high dimensional Euclidean distance matrix, making the SVD projection very noisy.\nFor the fMDS measure, SMACOF and PC perform very similarly under different levels of noise, both converging to similar cost functions with SMACOF running a bit faster, as seen in Figure 4(b). CD consistently runs slower and converges to a higher cost solution.\n5.3 The r2MDS Problem\nIn this setting we would expect CD to perform consistently as well as PC because both minimize the same cost function. However, this is not always the case because CD requires the SVD step to generate a point set in R\n¯ k.\nAs seen in Figure 5 this becomes a problem when k is small (k = 2,10). For medium values of k, CD converges slightly faster than PC and sometimes to a slightly lower cost solution, but again for large k (= 150), the REE\npart has trouble handling the amount of error and the solution cost oscillates. SMACOF is again consistently the fastest to converge, but unless k is very large (i.e. k = 150) then it converges to a significantly worse solution because the fMDS and r2MDS error functions are different."

It turns out that the Elad et.al. approach consistently performs poorly compared to both other techniques, and so we do not display it in our reported results. SMACOF-Q basically runs SMACOF on the original data set, but also adds one additional point p0 at the center of the sphere. The distance d0,i between any other point pi and p0 is set to be 1 thus encouraging all other points to be on a sphere, and this constraint is controlled by a weight factor κ, a larger κ implying a stronger emphasis on satisfying this constraint. Since the solution produced via this procedure may not lie on the sphere, we normalize all points to the sphere after each step for a fair comparison.\nHere we compare PC against SMACOF-Q in the g-1-SMDS (Figure 6(a)) and the c-2-SMDS (Figure 6(b)) problem. For g-1-SMDS, PC does not converge as quickly as SMACOF-Q with small κ, but it reaches a better cost value. However, when SMACOF-Q is run with a larger κ, then PC runs faster and reaches nearly the same cost value. For our input data, the solution has similar g-1-MDS and c-1-MDS cost. When we compare SMACOF-Q with PC under c-2-MDS (Figure 6(b)) then for an optimal choice of κ in SMACOF-Q, both PC and SMACOF-Q perform very similarly, converging to the same cost function and in about the same time. But for larger choices of κ SMACOF-Q does much worse than PC.\nIn both cases, it is possible to find a value of κ that allows SMACOF-Q to match PC. However, this value is different for different settings, and varies from input to input. The key observation here is that since PC is parameter-free, it can be run regardless of the choice of input or cost function, and consistently performs well."

Firstly, PC is consistently among the top performing methods, regardless of the choice of cost function, the nature of the input, or the level of noise in the problem. Occasionally, other methods will converge faster, but will not in general return a better quality answer, and different methods have much more variable behavior with changing\ninputs and noise levels."

      "text" : "In this section we present a Johnson-Lindenstrauss-style bound for mapping data from a high dimensional sphere to a low-dimensional sphere while preserving the distances to within a multiplicative error of (1+ \").\nConsider a set Y ⊂ S ¯ d ⊂ R ¯ d+1 of n points, defining a distance matrix D where the element di, j represents the geodesic distance between yi and y j on S¯ k. We seek an embedding of Y into S ¯\nd that preserves pairwise distances as much as possible. For a set Y ∈ S\n¯ d and a projection π(Y ) = X ⊂ S ¯ k we say the X has γ-distortion\nfrom Y if these exists a constant c such that for all x i , x j ∈ X\n(1− γ) f (yi , y j)≤ c f (x i , x j)≤ (1+ γ) f (yi , y j).\nFor a subspace H = R ¯ k, let πH(Y ) be the projection of Y ∈ R¯ d onto H and then scaled by d/k. For X ∈ R ¯ k,\nlet S(X ) be the projection to S ¯ k−1, that is for all x ∈ X , the corresponding point in S(X ) is x/||x ||. When f (yi , y j) = ||yi − y j||, and Y ∈ R¯\nd , then the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma [19] says that if H ⊂ R\n¯ d is a random k-dimensional linear subspace with k = O((1/\"2) log(n/δ)), then X = πH(Y ) has \"-\ndistortion from Y with probability at least 1−δ. We now present the main result of this section. We note that recent results [1] have shown similar results for point on a variety of manifolds (including spheres) where projections preserve Euclidean distances. We reiterate that our results extend this to geodesic distances on spheres which can be seen as angle ∠x ,y between the vectors to points x , y ∈ S\n¯ k. Another recent result [26] shows that k = O((1/\"2) log(n/δ)) dimensions\npreserves p \"-distortion in angles, which is weaker than the following result.\nTheorem 6.1. Let Y ⊂ S ¯ d ⊂ R ¯ d+1, and let H = R ¯ k+1 be a random subspace of R ¯ d with k = O((1/\"2) log(n/δ)) with \" ∈ (0, 1/4]. Let f (yi , y j) measure the geodesic distance on S¯ d (or S ¯\nk as appropriate). Then S(πH(Y )) has \"-distortion from Y with probability at least 1−δ.\nThis implies that if we project n data points that lie on any high-dimensional sphere to a low-dimensional sphere S\n¯ k with k ∼ log n, then the pairwise distances are each individually preserved. Before we proceed with\nthe proof, we require a key technical lemma.\nLemma 6.1. For \" ∈ [0,0.5] and x ∈ [0,0.7],\n(1) sin((1− 2\")x)≤ (1− \") sin(x), and\n(2) sin((1+ 2\")x)≥ (1+ \")sin(x).\ni || is as small as possible (lies on inner circle) and ||x\nmax\ni − x\nmax\nj || is as large as possible (on\nthe outer edges of the disks of diameter \"/8 shifted down from dashed line of length ||yi − y j||. Bounds for xmini and x min j are derived symmetrically.\nProof. Let g\"(x) = (1− \") sin x − sin((1− 2\")x). We will show that for x ∈ [0, 1] and \" ∈ [0, 0.5], g\"(x) is concave. This implies that it achieves its minimum value at the boundary. Now g\"(0) = 0 for all \", and it can be easily shown that g\"(0.7)≥ 0 for \" ∈ [0, 0.5]. This will therefore imply that g\"(x)≥ 0 in the specified range.\nIt remains to show that g\"(x) is concave in [0,0.7].\ng ′′\" (x) = (1− 2\") 2 sin((1− 2\")x)− (1− \") sin x\n≤ (1− \")(sin((1− 2\")x)− sin x)\nwhich is always negative for \" ∈ [0, 0.5] and since sin x is increasing in the range [0, 0.7]. This proves the first part of the lemma. For the second part, observe that h\"(x) = sin((1+2\")x)−(1+\")sin(x) can be rewritten as h\"(x) = g−\"(−x). The rest of the argument follows along the same lines, by showing that h\"(x) is concave in the desired range using that h′′\" (x) = g ′′ −\"(−x).\nWhile the upper bound of 0.7 on x is not tight, it is close. The actual bound (evaluated by direct calculation) is slightly over 0.72.\nProof of Theorem 6.1. Let X = πH(Y ). We consider two cases, (Short Case) when ‖yi − y j‖ ≤ 1/2 and (Long Case) when ‖yi − y j‖ ∈ (1/2,2].\nShort Case: First consider points yi , y j ∈ S¯ d such that ||yi− y j|| ≤ 1/2. Note that ||yi− y j||= 2 sin(∠yi ,y j/2),\nsince ||yi||= ||y j||= 1. By JL, we know that there exists a constant c such that\n(1− \"/8)||yi − y j|| ≤ c||x i − x j|| ≤ (1+ \"/8)||yi − y j||.\nWe need to compare the angle ∠x i ,x j with that of ∠yi ,y j . The largest ∠x i ,x j can be is when c||x i|| = c||x j|| = (1− \"/8) is as small as possible, and so ||cx i − cx j|| = (1+ \"/8)||yi − y j|| is as large as possible. See Figure 7. In this case, we have\n(||cx i||+ ||cx j||) sin(∠x i ,x j/2) ≤ ||cx i − cx j|| 2(1− \"/8) sin(∠x i ,x j/2) ≤ (1+ \"/8)||yi − y j|| 2(1− \"/8) sin(∠x i ,x j/2) ≤ (1+ \"/8)2sin(∠yi ,y j/2)\nsin(∠x i ,x j/2) ≤ 1+ \"/8 1− \"/8 sin(∠yi ,y j/2),\nwhich for \" < 4 implies sin(∠x i ,x j/2)≤ (1+ \"/2) sin(∠yi ,y j/2).\nSimilarly, we can show when ∠x i ,x j is as small as possible (when c||x i|| = c||x j|| = (1+ \") and ||cx i − cx j|| = (1− \")||yi − y j||), then\n(1− \"/2) sin(∠yi ,y j/2)≤ sin(∠x i ,x j/2).\nWe can also show (via Lemma 6.1) that since ||yi − y j|| ≤ 1/2 implies ∠yi ,y j < 0.7 we have\nsin((1− \")∠yi ,y j )≤ (1− \"/2) sin(∠yi ,y j )\nand (1+ \"/2) sin(∠yi ,y j )≤ sin((1+ \")∠yi ,y j ).\nThus, we have sin((1− \")∠yi ,y j/2) ≤ sin(∠x i ,x j/2) ≤ sin((1+ \")∠yi ,y j/2)\n(1− \")∠yi ,y j/2 ≤ ∠x i ,x j/2 ≤ (1+ \")∠yi ,y j/2 (1− \")∠yi ,y j ≤ ∠x i ,x j ≤ (1+ \")∠yi ,y j .\nLong Case: For ||yi − y j|| ∈ (1/2,2], we consider 6 additional points y (h) i, j ∈ S¯ d+1 (for h ∈ [1 : 6]) equally spaced between yi and y j on the shortest great circle connecting them. Let Ŷ be the set Y plus all added points {y(h)i, j }h=[1:6]. Note that |Ŷ |= O(n 2), so by JL we have that\n(1− \"/8)||yi − ŷi, j|| ≤ c||x i − x̂ i, j|| ≤ (1+ \"/8)||yi − ŷi, j||.\nFor notational convenience let yi = y (0) i, j and y j = y (7) i, j . Since for ‖yi− y j‖ ∈ (1/2, 2] then ‖y (h) i, j − y (h+1) i, j ‖ ≤ 1/2, for h ∈ [0 : 6]. This follows since the geodesic length of the great circular arc through yi and y j is at most π, and π/7 < 1/2. Then the chordal distance for each pair ‖y(h)i, j − y (h+1) i, j ‖ is upper bounded by the geodesic distance. Furthermore, by invoking the short case, for any pair\n(1− \")∠y(h)i, j ,y(h+1)i, j ≤ ∠x (h)i, j ,x (h+1)i, j ≤ (1+ \")∠y(h)i, j ,y(h)i, j .\nThen since projections preserve coplanarity (specifically, the points 0 and y(h)i, j for h ∈ [0 : 7] are coplanar, hence 0 and x (h)i, j for h ∈ [0 : 7] are coplanar), we can add together the bounds on angles which all lie on a single great circle.\n(1− \")∠yi ,y j ≤ (1− \") 6 ∑\nh=0\n∠y(h)i, j ,y(h+1)i, j ≤ ∑6 h=0∠x (h)i, j ,x (h+1)i, j ≤ (1+ \")\n6 ∑\nh=0\n∠y(h)i, j ,y(h+1)i, j ≤min{π, (1+ \")∠yi ,y j}\n(1− \")∠yi ,y j ≤ ∠x i ,x j ≤min{π, (1+ \")∠yi ,y j}."
