      "text" : "This text could be pipelined into a system with a builtin prediction model, with the objective of generating real-time graphs on opinion and sentiment trends. Although such tasks like the one described about have been explored with respect to document classification problems in the past, the implementation described in this paper, by virtue of learning a continuous function rather than a discrete one, offers a lot more depth of insight as compared to document classification approaches.\nThis study aims to explore the validity of such a continuous function predicting model to quantify sentiment about an entity, without the additional overhead of manual labeling, and computational preprocessing & feature extraction. This research project also aims to design and implement a re-usable document regression pipeline as a framework, Rapid-Rate[7], that can be used to predict document scores in real-time.\nKeywords— natural language processing, big data, word embedding, regression, streaming data processing, time-series analytics\nI. INTRODUCTION\nDocument labeling and significant feature discovery are already widely researched areas in the domain of natural language processing. The most common use-cases of document classification are product & service review rating predictions, automatic grading of essays, spam detection, plagiarism detection etc. However, most of the current approaches used for these tasks rely on lexicon based methods with a centralized dictionary indicating the weights of a word towards a set of\nemotions or sentiment. Some other approaches use document level similarity scores like TF-IDF or n-gram count vectorization approaches to assess the class of a previously unseen document.\nHowever, models like these are difficult to train for the following reasons:\n• Having to hand-pick features • Having to use stepwise regression to eliminate non-\nrelevant features • Having to manually re-train the models on a subset of\nthe features to determine the best-fit All of the processes described above are time-consuming and tedious. Also, n-gram approaches only partially model the language context probabilities i.e. the probably of a word occurring next in the corpus depends only on the n-1 words that precede it, and TF-IDF loses word context altogether. The objective of this research project is to implement and evaluate a software framework to effectively eliminate the above steps from the process of training a language model. Word2Vec, for instance, takes additional word context features into account while building the language model, a feature which will be elaborated upon in Section VII-A.\nThe proposition is to rely on unsupervised strategies like continuous bag-of-words and the skip-gram model to learn word embeddings. These word embeddings will serve as a syntactic and semantic proxy for the documents being processed. The features thus learned, can then be used to train regression models to predict document scores."

      "text" : "This section discusses the previous work done on mining and analytics pertaining to text data.\nMost of the similar work in the area of learning wordembeddings is related to classifying documents into a given set of labels or topics. The purpose of this study is to extend the usage of the document vector representation to demonstrating\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 08\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 M\nar 2\nits usage when the response variable (the output of a learning task) a continuous function (document-scoring) rather than discrete values (document classification). This work can be viewed as a generalization of the previous approaches, because this study aims to predict fine-grained document scores, rather than coarse document classifications.\nMost of the current work in usage of regression techniques on text content are related to meta-data or features extraction [24][25]. Similarly there have been several studies to identify document tags using classification techniques[12][23]. However, there is a relative absence of studies to evaluate the accuracy of regression models that try to predict a document score using a continuous-function model.\nAs far the the author is aware, there has been no similar work to test the regression accuracy of paragraph vectors in an experimental research setup before, and is hence, novel in that respect. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this approach will be assessed using a generic evaluation metric, the coefficient of determination score, which compares the predicted score-set against the golden set of actual scores."

The hypothesis is to prove that the document ratings have a positive correlation with the vectorized versions of the document text content, because the semantics of positive and negative reviews are expected to be captured by the shallow neural network\ntrained on the corpus. The expected R2 metric score being over 0, will confirm the hypothesis, and a negative value will contradict it."

      "text" : "The motivation for the project is to prove that a substantial amount of the semantic signal about sentiment with respect to a product or service, as extracted from a snippet or document of text, should prove to be a good indicator of the labeled document scores. If proven to be true, the objective includes building a real-time streaming framework, which can analyze unseen reviews from the corpus of unlabeled data, and be able to emit a score-prediction with minimal processing delays. This framework can be set-up on commodity hardware, and a given business can simply pipe their unlabeled reviews or articles into the system, and expect a graphical representation of the sentiment about a particular topic that is updated in real-time. The framework also allows rules to be set for alerts, so, for instance, if the approval rating of a particular business falls below a user-defined threshold, an email alert could be triggered to the business decision makers to respond quicker to the negative sentiment, a process which would otherwise span several business days."

Since sentiment as fine-grained values offer more depth in terms of sentiment insight [16], the study in this paper is formulated as a regression problem."

      "heading" : "A. Language Model Learning",
      "text" : "Language model learning is complicated because the most popular modeling approaches currently used have inherent limitations when it comes to being able to be used reliably for language understanding accuracy across the board. A few such instances are described in this section.\n1) Lexicon based model learning: Lexicon based models are reliable for one-off tasks, but they require hand-annotation of the polarity of words, and an over-dependence on the fact that the lexicon of words needs to be updated regularly as and when it comes across new words. This requires time and effort and is rather tedious. This challenge is addressed in the research project, by using an unsupervised method to learn the document vector representations, and not relying on any lexicon for details about word or document semantics.\n2) Statistical model based learning: TF-IDF and similar document scoring approaches, are based on the bag-of-words model. Hence, it does not capture position in text, semantics, co-occurrences in different documents, and other such features. Also, this shortcoming means that it cannot capture semantics of a word. It relies heavily on occurrence count across the entire corpus of documents.\n3) Cross domain applicability: One of the major drawbacks of statistical model based learning in particular is that a language model trained on a dataset belonging to a particular domain is highly unlikely to yield good results when assessed\nor tested on another domain. For instance, a language model trained for detecting sentiment on a movie review data-set can’t be used to accurately predict sentiment on a stockmarket discussion dataset. This is due to the inherent business domain specific differences in the vocabulary and connotations that will unlikely be modeled when trained on a completely different dataset than the one that the model needs to be tested upon. This problem is not directly tackled for this study, but the author proposes a potential direction in the Section XII which may help address this problem in future versions of Rapid-Rate."

For now, there is no clear best-approach for sarcasm and irony detection, and often, the best features for detecting such sentiment is text meta-data like emoticons and tags rather than the text itself, as discussed by González-Ibánez et al.[17]."

This happens when the process of data generation itself is unmoderated and does not impose too many constraints on the type of data allowed. It could also be that the data contains soft links or references to other entities within the data. As such, the onus is on the application to process large amount of unstructured data and attempt to extract some meaning and relations from it. This is tackled by adopting a Paragraph Vector approach to convert variable-length text into fixedlength vectors, described in detail in Section VII-B."

This allows a driver to submit multiple chunks of the same job to a number of workers. These workers can then convey the output to the driver once they finish their respective jobs, and the driver can aggregate these results. However, the library used for this study, Gensim, does not, by default, include a distributed setup for document model learning. Instead the onus is on the implementation to integrate Gensim with a distributed processing framework like Spark or Hadoop. The current implementation of Rapid-Rate uses a low-memory footprint iterator based technique to reduce the system memory usage on a single node, for the off-line document vector learning task described in Section IX-A. This could be scaled to train even higher volumes of documents if integrated with a distributed processing framework."

Hence the decision to separate the business logic of the document vector training component (off-line module) and the real-time prediction component (online module), as modular set. This can enable the document vector training to be done asynchronously in the background, agnostic of the current state of the real-time component, and keep enhancing the currently learned document vector model and machine learning modules. Similarly, the real-time prediction component does not need to be blocked on the document vector learning component after the first run. It can simply keep using the older version of the trained document vector model and machine learning model while the off-line component’s scheduled cronjob runs in the background.\nThis allows for easy maintenance if the off-line module needs to be temporarily paused for maintenance. Similarly, if the always-running daemon job for the on-line module needs to be temporarily paused, the streaming documents are not lost. The distributed queue keeps the documents queued, along with the offset of where the on-line module needs to resume reading from. This ensures that the on-line module can simply proceed from where it left off before being taken down for maintenance."

The latter ends up losing context of the words because of the fact that the words that follow it are not taken into account, and only the preceding words are.\nThe Word2Vec model[21] can take into consideration both preceding and following words, as a sliding window of text, to compute the probability of occurrence of the current word, as part of the Continuous Bag-of-words (CBOW) model. Alternatively, Word2Vec also provides a skip-gram model[22], which conversely, uses the context probabilitie of the current word, to predict the most likely words to precede and follow it. These word embeddings can be used to derive both syntactic as well as semantic relations in the vector space of the language model. A representation of this is given in Figure 1."

      "text" : "Paragraph vectors are a similar concept to Word2Vec, but rely on computing a fixed-length vector representation of a variable length group of words, which could be a sentence, a paragraph, or even an entire document.\nSince vectors representations of documents seem to outperform bag-of-words models for the purposes of semantic summarization and document classification tasks, it follows that a vector representation based approach should be used to evaluate performance on a regression task as well. Paragraph vectors also address some of the key weaknesses of bag-ofwords models. First, they inherit an important property of the word vectors: the semantics of the words. The second advantage of the paragraph vectors is that they take into consideration the word order, at least in a small context, in the same way that an n-gram model with a large n would do. This is important, because the n-gram model preserves a lot of information of the paragraph, including the word order[20]. The paragraph representation framework is depicted in Fig. 2.\nThe core concept here, is that an aggregation of the word vectors are being associated with a paragraph ID that encapsulates all of the words in question. Thus, rather than just assigning each individual word a vector representation, each paragraph/group of words in the body of the text document have been assigned a vector representation.\nThe implementation of paragraph vectors used for the purpose of implementing the system architecture in this study is Doc2Vec, from the Gensim library[4]."

Both these methods are described in the below sub-sections.\n1) Linear Regression: The problem of regression in mathematical statistics is characterized by the fact that there is insufficient information about the distributions of the variables under consideration[8].\nIn the case for this study, once the Doc2Vec implementation generates the vector space representation of each of the documents, each of the learned dimensions represent a different input variable for the regression problem. In reality, each of these dimensions represent a weighted probability score\ngenerated by the hidden layer of neurons in the paragraph vector model.\n2) Support Vector Regression: Support Vector Regression (SVR) attempts to minimize the generalization error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. The idea of SVR is based on the computation of a linear regression function in a high dimensional feature space where the input data are mapped via a nonlinear function. SVR has been applied in various fields time series and financial (noisy and risky) prediction, approximation of complex engineering analyses, convex quadratic programming and choices of loss functions[11].\nThe input parameters to the support vector regression model remain the same as those described above for the linear regression model."

This component’s setup is distributed, and is also able to subscribe to the updates being pushed by the message broker queue (Section VIII-A4).\n6) Time-Series Database: A time series database is optimized to handled collections of data objects that are indexed by time. It supports fast querying of data over temporal scan ranges and is ideal for time-series based analytics\n7) Analytics Dashboard: The analytics dashboard provides a visual representation of overall sentiment over time, and supports setting alerts to warn the end-user when overall sentiment dips below a certain user-defined threshold."

It indicates that the model captures a significant amount of the signal present in the independent variable. It can hence be relied to a degree of confidence to predict a close enough value to the actual intended document sentiment.\nAdditionally, this work has resulted in a generic framework that can be adopted to build a sentiment analytics dashboard on a user friendly interface. This framework can be extended to process any type of document content both for vector training and for the real-time sentiment prediction module.\nThe overall framework has been built using state-of-the-art product offerings for neural-net document embedding libraries, distributed stream processing in Spark, distributed queue architecture in Kafka, and the stable machine learning framework which is a part of scikit-learn.\nThe author believes this framework can be used both in industrial settings as well as in evaluation testbeds for any document embedding and machine learning libraries used as an ensemble architecture. The hypothesis made prior to undertaking this research project, as described in the Problem Statement (Section III) has been validated and proved to be true.\nThe framework itself, is open-sourced, and is free to be used to replicate the results or to be extended independently[7]."

      "text" : "With respect to the statistical models trained, the current approach supports only the simplest regression models i.e. Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This could be expanded to offer additional training mechanisms that can integrate more sophisticated regression algorithms for a higher level of accuracy.\nAdditional channels could be chosen as the culmination point of the newly rated unlabeled documents. For now, the data is stored in a time-series database. But this can easily be converted into something more generic, like publishing it to another Kafka queue. Multiple consumer applications\ncan, thus, benefit from the stream of insights published to the stream.\nWith reference to the natural language understanding challenge described in Section V-A3, a proposed solution could be to merely obfuscate the entities being spoken about the the document for which the sentiment analysis model is being trained for. Similarly, the obfuscation also needs to be done for the test dataset. Since this removes the dependence of the sentiment in the document to the sentiment expressed in it, it would logically allow for a more generic prediction model. Although this won’t completely mitigate the presence of domain-specific jargon, it does allow for a more accurate prediction model, and remains to be evaluated.\nAnother potential aim for future work is to reduce the time taken for the initial document vector training of the off-line model. As shown in the code profiling statistics present in Figure 4, it is evident that a significant reduction in the cost of training the initial model could be achieved if the document vectors training time were to be reduced. This can be achieved by the horizontal scaling described in Section VI-B."

    "abstractText" : "Commercial establishments like restaurants, service centers and retailers have several sources of customer feedback about products and services, most of which need not be as structured as rated reviews provided by services like Yelp, or Amazon, in terms of sentiment conveyed. For instance, Amazon provides a fine-grained score on a numeric scale for product reviews. Some sources, however, like social media (Twitter, Facebook), mailing lists (Google Groups) and forums (Quora) contain text data that is much more voluminous, but unstructured and unlabeled. It might be in the best interests of a business establishment to assess the general sentiment towards their brand on these platforms as well. This text could be pipelined into a system with a builtin prediction model, with the objective of generating real-time graphs on opinion and sentiment trends. Although such tasks like the one described about have been explored with respect to document classification problems in the past, the implementation described in this paper, by virtue of learning a continuous function rather than a discrete one, offers a lot more depth of insight as compared to document classification approaches. This study aims to explore the validity of such a continuous function predicting model to quantify sentiment about an entity, without the additional overhead of manual labeling, and computational preprocessing & feature extraction. This research project also aims to design and implement a re-usable document regression pipeline as a framework, Rapid-Rate[7], that can be used to predict document scores in real-time.
