      "text" : "Standard approaches to distributional semantics represent meanings as vectors, whether this is done using the more traditional count vectors (Turney and Pantel, 2010), or using embedding vectors trained with a neural network (Mikolov et al., 2013). While vector space models have advanced the state of the art in many tasks, they raise questions when it comes to representing larger phrases. Ideally, we would like to learn representations that naturally have logical interpretations.\nThere have been several attempts to incorporate vectors into logical representations, and while we do not have space for a full literature review here, we will mention two prominent lines of research. Coecke et al. (2010) and Baroni et al. (2014) propose a tensor-based approach, where vectors are combined according to argument structure. However, this leaves open the question of how to perform logical inference, as vector spaces do not provide a natural notion of entailment. Indeed,\nGrefenstette (2013) proved that quantifiers cannot be expressed using tensor calculus. Garrette et al. (2011) and Beltagy et al. (2016) incorporate a vector space model into a Markov Logic Network, in the form of weighted inference rules (the truth of one predicate implying the truth of another). This approach requires existing vectors, and assumes we can interpret similarity in terms of inference.\nIn contrast to the above, Emerson and Copestake (2016) (henceforth E&C) introduced the framework of Functional Distributional Semantics, which represents the meaning of a predicate not as a vector, but as a function.\nTo define these functions, we assume a semantic space X , each point representing the features of a possible individual. We refer to points in X as ‘pixies’, intuitively ‘pixels’ of the space, to make clear they are not individuals – two individuals may be represented by the same pixie. Further discussion of model theory will be given in forthcoming work (Emerson and Copestake, 2017) (henceforth E&C-forth). We take X to be a vector space, each dimension intuitively representing a feature.\nA semantic function maps from the space X to the range [0, 1]. This can be interpreted both in the machine-learning sense of a classifier, and in the logical sense of a truth-conditional function.1 In the machine learning view, a semantic function is a probabilistic classifier for a binary classification task – each input x ∈ X is either an instance of the predicate’s class, or it is not. In the logical view, a semantic function specifies what features a pixie needs to have in order for the predicate to be true of it – that is, the predicate’s truth conditions.\n1We take a probabilistic approach, where a predicate has a probability of truth for any pixie. We believe this is a strength of the model, as it can model fuzzy boundaries of concepts. However, we could also use semantic functions in a more traditional logic, by assigning truth when the function’s value is above 0.5, and falsehood otherwise. This is equivalent to turning the probabilistic classifier into a ‘hard’ classifier.\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n00 22\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nS ep\n2 01\n7\nThis is related to probabilistic type judgements in the framework of Probabilistic Type Theory with Records (TTR) (Cooper, 2005; Cooper et al., 2015). Working within TTR, Larsson (2013) argues in favour of representing perceptual concepts as classifiers of perceptual input. While TTR represents situations in terms of situation types, a semantic function model defines a semantic space without reference to any types or predicates.\nSchlangen et al. (2016) take a similar view, representing meanings as image classifiers. Zarrieß and Schlangen (2017) use a distributional model to help train such classifiers, but do not directly learn logical representations from distributional data.\nOur approach to logical inference is related to the work of Bergmair (2010) and Clarke and Keller (2015), who use fuzzy truth values and probabilistic truth values, respectively. However, neither incorporate distributional data.\nIn contrast to the above, a semantic function model can be trained on a parsed corpus. By defining a generative model, we can apply unsupervised learning: optimising the model parameters to maximise the probability of generating the corpus data.\nOur model can be trained on a corpus annotated with Dependency Minimal Recursion Semantics (DMRS) (Copestake et al., 2005; Copestake, 2009). This represents the meaning of a sentence as a semantic dependency graph that has a logical interpretation. An example DMRS graph is shown in Fig. 1 (ignoring quantifiers, and ignoring properties such number and tense). Note that, as these are semantic dependencies, not syntactic dependencies, active and passive voice sentences can be represented with the same graph. This dependency graph could be generated by the probabilistic graphical model shown in Fig. 2. The generated predicates are at the bottom: q might correspond to a verb, p its subject, and r its object. The dependency links (ARG1 and ARG2) are at the top.\nRather than generating the predicates directly, we assume that each predicate is true of a latent, unobserved pixie. For example, the DMRS graph for the dog chased the cat has three pixies, corresponding to the dog, the chasing event, and the cat. We can define a generative model for such sets of pixies (the top row of Fig. 2), assuming each link corresponds to a probabilistic dependence; intuitively, different kinds of events occur with different kinds of arguments. In machine learning terms, this forms an undirected graphical model.\ndog chase cat ARG2ARG1\nFigure 1: A simplified DMRS graph, illustrating the type of data observed during training. This graph would correspond to sentences like The dog chased the cat, or Cats are chased by dogs.\ny zx ARG2ARG1\n∈ X\ntc, x tc, y tc, z\n∈ {⊥,>} |V |\np q r\n∈ V\nFigure 2: A probabilistic graphical model for Functional Distributional Semantics (E&C Fig. 3). Each node denotes a random variable, but only the bottom row is observed. The plate (middle row) denotes repeating variables across the vocabulary. Top row: latent pixies x, y, and z, lying in a semantic space X . Their joint distribution is determined by the DMRS links ARG1 and ARG2. Middle row: each predicate c in the vocabulary V is probabilistically true or false for each pixie. Bottom row: for each pixie, we observe exactly one predicate, probabilistically chosen out of all predicates that are true of the pixie.\nWe generate the predicates in three stages (from top to bottom in Fig. 2). First, we generate a set of pixies, with DMRS links specifying probabilistic dependence. Second, we use the semantic functions for all predicates to generate a truth value for each predicate applied to each pixie. Third, for each pixie, we generate a single predicate out of all true predicates. The separation of pixies and truth values gives us a connection with logical inference, as we will see in §2.1.\nFor a DMRS graph with a different structure, we can define a similar graphical model. For example, for an intransitive sentence, with just a verb and its subject, we can remove the right-hand column of Fig. 2. The model parameters are shared across all such graphs, so we can train our model on a heterogenous set of DMRS graphs.\nWe follow E&C, and implement this model as shown in Fig. 3. The semantic space X consists of\nsparse binary-valued vectors, where a small fixed number of dimensions are 1, and the rest 0. Intuitively, each dimension is a ‘feature’ of a pixie, and only a small number are present. The joint distribution over pixies is given by a Cardinality Restricted Boltzmann Machine (CaRBM) (Swersky et al., 2012). The semantic functions are one-layer feedforward networks, with a sigmoid activation so the output is in the range [0, 1]. The probability of generating a predicate (bottom row) is weighted by the observed frequency of the predicate."

      "text" : "The model in Fig. 2 contains, in the middle row, a node for the truth of each predicate for each pixie. Using these nodes, we can convert certain logical propositions into statements about probabilities.\nFor example, we might be interested in whether one predicate implies another. For simplicity, consider a single pixie x, as shown in Fig. 4. Then, the logical proposition ∀x ∈ X , a(x)⇒ b(x) is equivalent2 to the statement P (tb,x|ta,x) = 1.\n2More precisely, the equivalence requires the logic to have ‘existential import’: Every A implies that some A exists. This follows from the definition of conditional probability P (B|A) = P (A ∧B)/P (A), only defined if P (A) 6= 0\nIntuitively, conditioning on ta,x means restricting to those pixies x for which the predicate a is true. If the probability of tb,x being true is 1, then the predicate b is true for all of those x. Similarly, ∃x ∈ X , a(x) ∧ b(x) is equivalent to P (tb,x|ta,x) > 0. Furthermore, classical rules of inference hold under this equivalence. For example, from P (tb,x|ta,x) = 1 and P (tc,x|tb,x) = 1, we can deduce that P (tc,x|ta,x) = 1. This is precisely the classical Barbara syllogism. A proof is given in Appendix A.\nIn practice, when training on distributional data, the conditional probability P (tb,x|ta,x) will never be exactly 0 or 1, because the model only implements soft constraints. Nonetheless, this quantity can be very informative: if it is 0.999, then we know that if a(x) is true, it is almost always the case that b(x) is also true. So, it represents the degree to which a implies b, in an intuitive sense.\nSeparate from this notion of inference, we can also consider the similarity of two latent pixies – if a is true of x, and b is true of y, how many features do x and y share? If a and b are antonyms, the truth of one will not imply the truth of the other, but the pixies may share many features.\nAs Copestake and Herbelot (2012) note, distinguishing synonyms and antonyms requires checking whether expressions are mutually exclusive. We do not have access to such information in our training data, and such cases are inconsistently annotated in our test data (see §3.1). Nonetheless, the model allows us to make such a distinction, which is an advantage over vector space models. Exploiting this distinction (perhaps by using coreference information) would be a task for future work.\nTo calculate P (tb,x|ta,x), we must marginalise out x, because the model actually defines the joint probability P (x, tb,x, ta,x). This is analogous to removing bound variables when calculating the truth of quantified expressions in classical logic. Quantifiers will be discussed further by E&C-forth. However, marginalising out x requires summing over the semantic space X , which is intractable when X has a large number of dimensions. In §2.2, we introduce a variational approximation to make this calculation tractable.\nIn the general case, there are multiple pixie variables. This opens up the possibility of inferring what is true of one pixie, given what is true of another. For example, we might be interested in what is true of a verb’s arguments, which we could ex-\nplore with the three-pixie graph in Fig. 5. We can ask questions such as: if the predicate paint is true of an event, what predicates are true of its arguments? A good model might answer that for the ARG1 pixie, artist and person are likely true, while democracy and aubergine are likely false.\nJust as with the one-pixie case, there is an equivalence between logical propositions and statements about probabilities. For example, ∃x, y ∈ X , a(y) ∧ b(x) ∧ ARG1(y, x) is equivalent to P (tb,x|ta,y) > 0. Note that ARG1 does not correspond to a random variable – it is instead represented directly by the structure of the graphical model (the edges in the top row of Fig. 2 and the middle row of Fig. 5). As before, this conditional probability is never going to be exactly 0 or 1, but it is nonetheless a useful quantity when performing approximate inference, as we will see in §3.2."

      "heading" : "2.2 Variational Inference",
      "text" : "As explained in the previous section, we can express certain logical propositions as conditional probabilities, but calculating these probabilities exactly is intractable, as it involves summing over the semantic space, which grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. Furthermore, we need to calculate similar conditional probabilities when training the model in the first place.\nInstead of summing over the entire space, E&C proposed summing over a small number of carefully chosen pixies, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. However, this algorithm is slow for two reasons. Firstly, many iterations of the Markov chain are required before the samples are useful. Secondly, even if we are not summing over the entire space, many samples are still needed, because the discrete values lead to high variance.\nIn this section, we introduce a variational inference algorithm, where we directly approximate the distribution over pixies that we need to calculate, and then optimise this approximation. This makes the calculations in the previous section tractable, and also makes training more efficient.\nThe distribution we need to approximate is P (x|tc,x), the probability that a latent pixie x has particular features, given the truth of some predicate c. We use a mean-field approximation: we assume that each dimension has an independent probability qi of being active, as shown in (1). The approximate probability Q(x) is simply the product of the probabilities of each dimension. Furthermore, we assume that each of these probabilities depends on the average activation of all other dimensions (i.e. the mean field activation).\nP (x|tc,x) ≈ Q(x) = ∏\ni|xi=1\nqi ∏\ni|xi=0\n(1− qi) (1)\nFor Q to be a good approximation, it needs to be close to P . We can measure this using the Kullback-Leibler divergence from Q to P .3 Minimising this quantity is also done in the Expectation Propagation algorithm (Minka, 2001). However, a semantic function model is not in the exponential family, making it difficult to apply Expectation Propagation directly.\nGiven this mean-field approximation Q(x), we have a a mean-field vector qi. This vector is not in X , because each dimension is now a value in the range [0, 1], rather than taking one of the values 0 or 1. It represents a ‘typical’ pixie for these truth values. Furthermore, we have implemented semantic functions as one-layer neural networks, and each weight in the network can be multiplied\n3Variational Bayes minimises the KL-divergence in the opposite direction – that is, the KL-divergence from P to Q. However, for the above approximation, this is infinite: if the number of active units is not equal to the fixed cardinality, then P (x|tc,x) = 0 but Q(x) 6= 0, giving infinite Q(x) logP (x|tc,x). Furthermore, while Variational Bayes prefers ‘high precision’ approximations (areas of high Q are accurate), we will prefer ‘high recall’ approximations (areas of high P are accurate). This is appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, in areas where the number of active units is wrong, Q is bound to be too high, but if we want to sample from Q, we can avoid these areas by using belief propagation, as explained by Swersky et al. (2012). Secondly, in areas where the number of active units is correct, Q will be much higher than P only if there is a dependence between dimensions that Q cannot capture, such as if P is a multi-modal distribution. Because of the definition of an RBM, such a dependence is impossible within one pixie, and combined with the simple form of our semantic functions, such a dependence will be rare between pixies.\nby a value in the range [0, 1] just as easily as it can be multiplied by 0 or 1. Since a mean-field vector defines a distribution over pixies, applying a semantic function to a mean-field vector lets us approximately calculate the probability that a predicate is true of a pixie drawn from this distribution.\nDifferentiating the KL-divergence with respect to qi, and using the above idea that we can apply semantic functions to mean-field vectors, we can derive the update rule given in (2), with a full derivation given in Appendix B. This updates the value of qi, while holding the rest fixed. Here, x(+i) is the mean-field vector where unit i is fixed to be on, x(−i) is the mean-field vector where unit i is fixed to be off, tc is the semantic function for the predicate c, D is the number of dimensions of X , and C is the number of active units. Optimising Q can then be done by repeatedly applying this update rule across all dimensions.\nqi =\n( 1 +\nD − C C\ntc ( x(−i) ) tc ( x(+i) ))−1 (2) This update rule looks at how likely the predicate c is to be true when the dimension xi is active, and when it is not. If c is much more likely to be true when xi is active, then qi will be close to 1. If c is much more likely to be true when xi is inactive, then qi will be close to 0. If there is no difference at all, then qi will be C/D, the expected probability if all dimensions are equally likely.\nWe can apply this to logical inference, to calculate P (tb,x|ta,x), as shown in Fig. 6. We first find the mean-field vector for x, conditioning on the truth of a. This approximates P (x|ta,x). Then, we evaluate the semantic function for b on this meanfield vector. This approximates P (tb,x|ta,x).\nFor multiple pixies, the process is similar, as shown in Fig. 7. We have one mean-field vector for each pixie, and we optimise these together. The only difference to the update rule is that, as well as considering how activating one dimension changes the probability of a predicate being true, we also have to consider how likely this dimension is to be active, given the other pixies in the graph. This leads to an extra term in the update rule, as exemplified in (3), where there is a link from x to y. The link has weights Wij which control how likely it is that xi and yj are both active.\nqi =\n( 1 +\nD − C C\ntc ( x(−i) ) tc ( x(+i) )e−ΣjWijyj)−1 (3)\n3 Experimental Results4\nFinding a good evaluation task is difficult. Lexical similarity tasks do not require logical inference, while tasks like textual entailment require a level of coverage beyond the scope of this paper. We consider two tasks: lexical similarity, as a simple benchmark, and the RELPRON dataset, which lets us explore a controlled kind of inference.\nWe trained our model on subject-verb-object (SVO) triples extracted from WikiWoods5, a parsed version of the July 2008 dump of the English Wikipedia, distributed by DELPH-IN. This resource was produced by Flickinger et al. (2010), using the English Resource Grammar (Flickinger, 2000, 2011), and the PET parser (Callmeier, 2001; Toutanova et al., 2005), with parse ranking trained on the manually treebanked subcorpus WeScience (Ytrestøl et al., 2009).\nOur source code is available online.6 The WikiWoods corpus was pre-processed using the Python packages pydelphin7 (developed by Michael Goodman), and pydmrs8 (Copestake et al., 2016).\nTo speed up training, we initialised our model using random positive-only projections, a simple method for producing reduced-dimension count vectors (QasemiZadeh and Kallmeyer, 2016). Rather than counting each context separately, every context is randomly mapped to a dimension, so each dimension corresponds to the total count of several contexts. These counts can then be trans-\n4A fuller set of results, with further discussion, will be given by E&C-forth.\n5http://moin.delph-in.net/WikiWoods 6http://github.com/guyemerson/sem-func 7http://github.com/delph-in/pydelphin 8http://github.com/delph-in/pydmrs\nformed into PPMI scores. As with normal PPMIbased count vectors, there are several hyperparameters that can be tuned (Levy et al., 2015) – however, as we are using these vectors as parameters for semantic functions, it should be noted that the optimal hyperparameter settings are not the same.\nWe compare our model to two vector space models, also trained on Wikipedia. Both use Mikolov et al. (2013)’s skipgram algorithm with negative sampling. “Word2Vec” was trained on raw text, while “SVO Word2Vec” was trained on the same SVO triples used to train our model. We tested these models using cosine similarity."

Since this is an asymmetric measure, we multiply the conditional probabilities in both directions, i.e. we calculate P (ta,x|tb,x)P (tb,x|ta,x).\nWe evaluated on two datasets which aim to capture similarity, rather than relatedness: SimLex999 (Hill et al., 2015), and WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001), which Agirre et al.

In the real world, related predicates are unlikely to be true of the same pixies (and the pixies they are true of are unlikely to even share features). For predicates which are true of similar but disjoint sets of pixies, annotations in these datasets are inconsistent. For example, SimLex-999 gives a low score to (aunt, uncle), but a high score to (cat, dog). The semantic function model achieves the lowest correlation on the relatedness subset.\nCompared to E&C, the gap between the semantic function model and the vector space models has essentially been closed. Which model performs best is inconsistent across the evaluation datasets. This shows that the previously reported lower performance was not due to a problem with the model itself, but rather with an inefficient training algorithm and with poor choice of hyperparameters."

      "text" : "The RELPRON dataset was produced by Rimell et al. (2016). It consists of ‘terms’ (all nouns), each paired with up to ten ‘properties’. For example, a telescope is a device that astronomers use, and a saw is a device that cuts wood. All properties are of this form: a hypernym of the term, modified by a relative clause with a transitive verb. For each term, the task is to identify the properties which apply to this term. Since every property follows one of only two patterns, this dataset lets us focus on semantics, rather than parsing.\nA model that captures relatedness can achieve good performance on this dataset – Rimell et al. found that the other argument of the verb was the best predictor of the term (e.g. astronomer predicts telescope). Logically speaking, these predicates do not imply each other. However, Rimell et al. included confounders for a model relying on relatedness – e.g. a document that has a balance is an account, not the quality of balance. In all of their models, this was the top-ranked property for balance. By combining a vector model with our model, we hoped to improve performance.\nWe tested our model using the method described in §2 and illustrated in Figs. 5 and 7: for each term and property, we find the probability of the term being true, conditioned on all predicates in the property. Results are given in Table 2. As noted in §3.1, our model does not capture relatedness, and it performs below vector addition. However, the ensemble outperforms the vector space\nmodel alone. This improvement is not simply due to increasing the capacity of the model – increasing the dimensionality of the vector space did not yield this improvement.\nFurthermore, inspecting the differences in predictions between the vector space model and the ensemble, it appears that there is particular improvement on the confounders included in the dataset, which require some kind of logical inference. In our ensemble model, for the term balance, the top-ranked property is no longer the confounder document that has a balance, but instead the correct property quality that an ear maintains."

So, we can approximate it as:\nexp− ∑ x l−→ y ∑ k W (l) ik yk\nThis gives the following update rule, which reduces to (3) in the case of a single link:1 + D−C\nC\ntc ( x(−i) ) tc ( x(+i) ) exp−∑ x l−→ y ∑ k W (l) ik yk  −1"

Here we make two contributions to this framework. The first is to show how a type of logical inference can be performed by evaluating conditional probabilities. The second is to make these calculations tractable by means of a variational approximation. This approximation also enables faster convergence during training, allowing us to close the gap with state-of-the-art vector space models when evaluating on semantic similarity. We demonstrate promising performance on two tasks.",
