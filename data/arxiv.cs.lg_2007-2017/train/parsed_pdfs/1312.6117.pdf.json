In this project\nwe calculate Hierarchical clustering with the k-center\ncost function and compare this kind of the clustering\nwith K-means. This kind of clustering is really useful\nfor data that K value is not available and result of\noutput is many cluster in one figure like DNA\nsequences, RNA sequences etc. which the number of\nthe cluster is not available for specialist and case by\ncase is different “First, there was apparent gene-\ncentered clustering of RNA-exclusive events, and\nsecond, high proportion of the putative RNA editing\nsites seemed to be predominant, often to monozygotic\nlevel, of the variant (vs. wt.) nucleotide harboring\nreads.”[1]\nSpectral clustering: “this method is a more powerful and specialized algorithm (compared to K-means), derives its name from spectral analysis of a graph, which is how the data are represented. Each object to be clustered can initially be represented as an ndimensional numeric vector, but the difference with this algorithm is that there must also be some method for performing a comparison between each object and expressing this comparison as a scalar. ” [2]\nGenerally speaking, Spectral clustering is more powerful than k-means because it can cluster data point which are not in very close to each other’s. If look at figure 1 it compares this two method. In this project we compare three different algorithms\nby details. Many clustering algorithms on data sets\nwith low volume)\nLess than a few percent of big data may well work,\nbut millions have done. Clustering on a sample big\ndata set may therefore be inaccurate. Finally we talk\nabout these three algorithms."

Spectral clustering solve this problem by using affinity matrix which is very big matrix \uD835\uDC41 × \uD835\uDC41 and this matrix find the best relation between each two different data points. Time complexity of Spectral Clustering is\uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC5B3), but in Kmeans time complexity is not fixable which can be \uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC5B2) to \uD835\uDC42(2\uD835\uDC5B) that is one of the most important problems of K-means; however, sometimes K-means for easier project K-means implementation is easier and also more sensitive. If you look at Figure 1: you\ncan see it has a lot of error rate in the evaluation part we considered on the result of our data sets. “When the distortion measure is squared error, the most commonly used algorithm for vector quantization’s k-means, which has both theoretical support and the virtue of simplicity. The k-means algorithm employs an iterative procedure. At each iteration, the algorithm assign each data point to the nearest centroid, and recalculates the cluster centroids. The procedure stops when the total sum of squared error stabilizes.”[12].\n[16]"
