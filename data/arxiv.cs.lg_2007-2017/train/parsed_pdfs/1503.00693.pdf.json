      "text" : "NLP researchers and practitioners spend a considerable amount of time comparing machine-learned models of text that differ in relatively uninteresting ways. For example, in categorizing texts, should the “bag of words” include bigrams, and is tf-idf weighting a good idea? These choices matter experimentally, often leading to big differences in performance, with little consistency across tasks and datasets in which combination of choices works best. Unfortunately, these differences tell us little about language or the problems that machine learners are supposed to solve.\nWe propose that these decisions can be automated in a similar way to hyperparameter selection (e.g., choosing the strength of a ridge or lasso regularizer). Given a particular text dataset and classification task, we introduce a technique for optimizing over the space of representational choices,\nalong with other “nuisances” that interact with these decisions, like hyperparameter selection.1 For example, using higher-order n-grams means more features and a need for stronger regularization and more training iterations. Generally, these decisions about instance representation are made by humans, heuristically; our work is the first to automate them.\nOur technique instantiates sequential modelbased optimization (SMBO; Hutter et al., 2011). SMBO and other Bayesian optimization approaches have been shown to work well for hyperparameter tuning (Bergstra et al., 2011; Hoffman et al., 2011; Snoek et al., 2012). Though popular in computer vision (Bergstra et al., 2013), these techniques have received little attention in NLP.\nWe apply the technique to logistic regression on a range of topic and sentiment classification tasks. Consistently, our method finds representational choices that perform better than linear baselines previously reported in the literature, and that, in some cases, are competitive with more sophisticated non-linear models trained using neural networks."

The overall training goal is to maximize a performance function f (e.g., classification accuracy, log-likelihood, F1 score, etc.) of a machine-learned model, on a held-out dataset, ddev ∈ (I× O)n ′ .\nClassfication proceeds in three steps: first, x : I→ RN maps each input to a vector representation. Second, a classifier is learned from the inputs (now transformed into vectors) and outputs: L : (RN × O)n → (RN → O). Finally, the resulting classifier\n1In §5 we argue that the technique is also applicable in unsupervised settings.\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n00 69\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n5\nc : I→ O is fixed as\nL(dtrain) ◦ x O← RN RN ← I\n(i.e., the composition of the representation function with the learned classifier).\nHere we consider linear classifiers of the form\nc(d.i) = argmax o∈O\nw>o x(d.i) (1)\nwhere the coefficients wo ∈ RN , for each output o, are learned using logistic regression on the training data. We let w denote the concatenation of all wo. Hence the parameters can be understood as a function of the training data and the representation function x. The performance function f , in turn, is a function of the held-out data ddev and x—also w and dtrain , through x. For simplicity, we will write “f(x)” when the rest are clear from context.\nTypically, x is fixed by the model designer, perhaps after some experimentation, and learning focuses on selecting the parameters w. For logistic regression and many other linear models, this training step reduces to convex optimization in N |O| dimensions—a solvable problem that is still costly for large datasets and/or large output spaces. In seeking to maximize f with respect to x, we do not wish to carry out training any more times than necessary.\nChoosing x can be understood as a problem of selecting hyperparameter values. We therefore turn to Bayesian optimization, a family of techniques recently introduced for selecting hyperparameter values intelligently when solving for parameters (w) is costly."

      "text" : "Our approach is based on sequential model-based optimization (SMBO; Hutter et al., 2011). It iteratively chooses representation functions x. On each round, it makes this choice through a nonparametrically-estimated probabilistic model of f , then evaluates f—we call this a “trial.” As in any iterative search algorithm, the goal is to balance exploration of options for x with exploitation of previously-explored options, so that a good choice is found in a small number of trials. See Algorithm 1.\nMore concretely, in the tth trial, xt is selected using an acquisition function A and a “surrogate” probabilistic model pt.

      "text" : "A good acquisition function returns high values for x such that either the value f(x) is predicted to be high, or because uncertainty about f(x)’s value is high; balancing between these is the classic tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. We use a criterion called Expected Improvement (EI; Jones, 2001), which is the expectation (under the current surrogate model pt) that the choice y will exceed y∗:\nA(x; pt, y ∗) = ∫ ∞ −∞ max(y − y∗, 0)pt(y | x)dy\nwhere y∗ is chosen depending on the surrogate model, discussed below. (For now, think of it as a strongly-performing “benchmark” value of f , discovered in earlier iterations.) Other options for the acquisition function include maximum probability of improvement (Jones, 2001), minimum conditional entropy (Villemonteix et al., 2006), Gaussian process upper confidence bound (Srinivas et al., 2010), or a combination of them (Hoffman et al., 2011).

      "text" : "As a surrogate model, we use a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE; Bergstra et al., 2011). This is a nonparametric approach to density estimation. We seek to estimate pt(y | x) where y = f(x), the\nperformance function that is expensive to compute exactly. The TPE approach is as follows:\npt(y | x) ∝ pt(y) · pt(x | y)\npt(x | y) =\n{ p<t (x), if y < y ∗\np≥t (x), if y ≥ y∗\nwhere p<t and p ≥ t are densities estimated using observations from previous trials that are less than and greater than y∗, respectively. In TPE, y∗ is defined as some quantile of the observed y; we use 15-quantiles.\nAs shown by Bergstra et al. (2011), the Expected Improvement in TPE can be written as:\nA(x; pt, y ∗) ∝ ( γ + p<t (x)\np≥t (x) (1− γ)\n)−1 , (2)\nwhere γ = pt(y < y∗), fixed at 0.15 by definition of y∗ (above). Here, we prefer x with high probability under p≥t (x) and low probability under p<t (x). To maximize this quantity, we draw many candidates according to p≥t (x) and evaluate them according to p<t (x)/p ≥ t (x). Note that p(y) does not need to be given an explicit form. In order to evaluate Eq. 2, we need to compute p<t (x) and p ≥ t (x). These joint distributions depend on the graphical model of the hyperparameter space—which is allowed to form a tree structure.\nWe discuss how to compute p<t (x) in the following. p≥t (x) is computed similarly, using trials where y ≥ y∗. We associate each hyperparameter with a node in the graphical model; consider the kth dimension of x, denoted by random variable Xk.\n• If Xk ranges over a discrete set X, TPE uses a reweighted categorical distribution, where the probability that Xk = x is proportional to a smoothing parameter plus the counts of occurrences of Xk = x in xk1:t with yt < y\n∗. • When Xk is continuous-valued, TPE constructs\na probability distribution by placing a truncated Gaussian distribution centered at each of xkk,1:t where yt < y∗, with standard deviation set to the greater of the distances to the left and right neighbors.\nIn the simplest version, each node is independent, so we can compute p<t (x) by multiplying individual probabilities at every node. In the treestructured version, we only multiply probabilities along the relevant path, excluding some nodes.\nAnother common approach to the surrogate is the Gaussian Process (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006; Hoffman et al., 2011; Snoek et al., 2012). Like Bergstra et al. (2011), our preliminary experiments found the TPE to perform favorably. Further TPE’s tree-structured configuration space is advantageous, because it allows nested definitions of hyperparameters, which we exploit in our experiments (e.g., only allows bigrams to be chosen if unigrams are also chosen)."

For n-grams, we have two parameters, minimum and maximum lengths (nmin and nmax ). (All n-gram lengths between the minimum and maximum, inclusive, are used.) For weighting scheme, we consider term frequency, tf-idf, and binary schemes. Last, we also choose whether we should remove stopwords before constructing feature vectors for each document.\nFurthermore, the choice of representation interacts with the regularizer and the training convergence criterion (e.g., more n-grams means slower training time). We consider two regularizers, `1 penalty (Tibshirani, 1996) or squared `2 penalty (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970). We also have hyperparameters for regularization strength and training convergence tolerance. See Table 1 for a complete list of hyperparameters in our experiments.\nNote that even with this limited number of options, the number of possible combinations is\n2http://www.automl.org/hpolib.html\nhuge (it is actually infinite since the regularization strength and convergence tolerance are continuous values, although we can also use sets of possible values), so exhaustive search is computationally expensive. In all our experiments for all datasets, we limit ourselves to 30 trials per dataset.

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "Raw text as input and other hyperparameters. Our results suggest that seemingly mundane representation choices can raise the performance of simple linear models to be comparable with much more sophisticated models. Achieving these results is not a matter of deep expertise about the domain or engineering skill; the choices can be automated. Our experiments only considered logistic regression with downcased text; more choices— stemming, count thresholding, normalization of numbers, etc.—can be offered to the optimizer, as can additional feature options like gappy n-grams.\nAs NLP becomes more widely used in applications, we believe that automating these choices will be very attractive for those who need to train a high-performance model quickly.\n7This method was designed for structured prediction, but Srikumar and Manning (2014) also applied it to classification. It attempts to learn a distributed representation for features and for labels. The authors used unigrams and did not elaborate the weighting scheme.\n8They also report a naı̈ve Bayes/SVM ensemble achieving 87.9% and 91.2%.\nOptimized representations. For each task, the chosen representation is different. Out of all possible hyperparameter choices in our experiments (Table 1), each of them is used by at least one of the datsets (Table 3). For example, on the Congressional Vote dataset, we only need to use bigrams, whereas on the Amazon electronics dataset we need to use unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. The binary weighting scheme works well for most of the datasets, except the sentence-level sentence analysis task, where the tf-idf weighting scheme was selected. `2 regularization was best in all cases but one.\nWe do not believe that an NLP expert would be likely to make these particular choices, except through the same kind of trial-and-error process our method automates efficiently. Often, we believe, researchers in NLP make initial choices and stick with them through all experiments (as we have admittedly done with logistic regression). Optimizing over more of these choices will give stronger baselines.\nTraining time. We ran 30 trials for each dataset in our experiments. Figure 1 shows each trial accuracy and the best accuracy on development data as we increase the number of trials for three datasets. We can see that 30 trials are generally enough for the model to obtain good results, although the search space is large.\nIn the presence of unlimited computational resources, Bayesian optimization is slower than grid search on all hyperparameters, since the latter is easy to parallelize. This is not realistic in most research and development environments, and it is certainly impractical in increasingly widespread\ninstances of personalized machine learning. The Bayesian optimization approach that we use in our experiments is performed sequentially. It attempts to predict what set of hyperparameters we should try next based on information from previous trials. There has been work to parallelize Bayesian optimization, making it possible to leverage the power of multicore architectures (Snoek et al., 2012; Desautels et al., 2012; Hutter et al., 2012).\nTransfer learning and multitask setting. We treat each dataset independently and create a separate model for each of them. It is also possible to learn from previous datasets (i.e., transfer learning) or to learn from all datasets simultaneously (i.e., multitask learning) to improve performance. This has the potential to reduce the number of trials required even further. See Bardenet et al. (2013), Swersky et al. (2013), and Yogatama and Mann (2014) for how to perform Bayesian optimization in these settings.\nBeyond linear models. We use logistic regression as our classification model, and our experiments show how simple linear models can be competitive with more sophisticated models given the right representation. Other models, can be considered, of course, as can ensembles (Yogatama and Mann, 2014). Increasing the number of options may lead to a need for more trials, and evaluating f(x) (e.g., training the neural network) will take longer for more sophisticated models. We have demonstrated, using one of the simplest classification models (logistic regression), that even simple choices about text representation can matter quite a lot.\nStructured prediction problems Our framework could also be applied to structured prediction problems. For example, in part-of-speech tagging, the set of features can include character n-grams, word shape features, and word type features. The optimal choice for different languages is not always the same, our approach can automate this process.\nBeyond supervised learning. Our framework could also be extended to unsupervised and semisupervised models. For example, in document clustering (e.g., k-means), we also need to construct representations for documents. Log-likelihood might serve as a performance function. A range of random initializations might be considered. Investigation of this approach for nonconvex problems like clustering is an exciting area for future work."

      "text" : "We used a Bayesian optimization approach to optimize choices about text representations for various categorization problems. Our sequential modelbased optimization technique identifies settings for a standard linear model (logistic regression) that are competitive with far more sophisticated stateof-the-art methods on topic classification and sentiment analysis. Every task and dataset has its own optimal choices; though relatively uninteresting to researchers and not directly linked to domain or linguistic expertise, these choices have a big effect on performance. We see our approach as a first step towards black-box NLP systems that work with raw text and do not require manual tuning."

These choices can have a big effect on performance, but they are often uninteresting to researchers or practitioners who simply need a module that performs well. We propose an approach to optimizing over this space of choices, formulating the problem as global optimization. We apply a sequential model-based optimization technique and show that our method makes standard linear models competitive with more sophisticated, expensive state-of-theart methods based on latent variable models or neural networks on various topic classification and sentiment analysis problems. Our approach is a first step towards blackbox NLP systems that work with raw text and do not require manual tuning.",
