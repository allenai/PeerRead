{"conference": "nips", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Oct-2016", "title": "A Greedy Approach for Budgeted Maximum Inner Product Search", "abstract": "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task in many machine learning applications such as the prediction phase of a low-rank matrix factorization model for a recommender system. There have been some works on how to perform MIPS in sub-linear time recently. However, most of them do not have the flexibility to control the trade-off between search efficient and search quality. In this paper, we study the MIPS problem with a computational budget. By carefully studying the problem structure of MIPS, we develop a novel Greedy-MIPS algorithm, which can handle budgeted MIPS by design. While simple and intuitive, Greedy-MIPS yields surprisingly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. As a specific example, on a candidate set containing half a million vectors of dimension 200, Greedy-MIPS runs 200x faster than the naive approach while yielding search results with the top-5 precision greater than 75\\%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 13:10:48 GMT  (6874kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03317v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["hsiang-fu yu", "cho-jui hsieh", "qi lei", "inderjit s dhillon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.03317"}
