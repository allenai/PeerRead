      "text" : "Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years. Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even though they form part of a review’s argumentative structure. Intuitively, sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five multilingual, multi-domain datasets without any handengineered features or external resources."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008) is used to gauge public opinion towards products, to analyze customer satisfaction, and to detect trends. With the proliferation of customer reviews, more fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has gained in popularity, as it allows aspects of a product or service to be examined in more detail.\nReviews – just with any coherent text – have an underlying structure. A visualization of the discourse structure according to Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988) for the example review in Figure 1 reveals that sentences\nand clauses are connected via different rhetorical relations, such as Elaboration and Background.\nIntuitively, knowledge about the relations and the sentiment of surrounding sentences should inform the sentiment of the current sentence. If a reviewer of a restaurant has shown a positive sentiment towards the quality of the food, it is likely that his opinion will not change drastically over the course of the review. Additionally, overwhelmingly positive or negative sentences in the review help to disambiguate sentences whose sentiment is equivocal.\nNeural network-based architectures that have recently become popular for sentiment analysis and ABSA, such as convolutional neural networks (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015), LSTMs (Vo and Zhang, 2015), and recursive neural networks (Nguyen and Shirai, 2015), however, are only able to consider intra-sentence relations such as Background in Figure 1 and fail to capture inter-sentence relations, e.g. Elaboration that rely on discourse structure and provide valuable clues for sentiment prediction.\nWe introduce a hierarchical bidirectional long short-term memory (H-LSTM) that is able to leverage both intra- and inter-sentence relations. The sole dependence on sentences and their structure\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n02 74\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nS ep\n2 01\nwithin a review renders our model fully languageindependent. We show that the hierarchical model outperforms strong sentence-level baselines for aspect-based sentiment analysis, while achieving results competitive with the state-of-the-art and outperforming it on several datasets without relying on any hand-engineered features or sentiment lexica."

      "text" : "Aspect-based sentiment analysis. Past approaches use classifiers with expensive hand-crafted features based on n-grams, parts-of-speech, negation words, and sentiment lexica (Pontiki et al., 2014; Pontiki et al., 2015). The model by Zhang and Lan (2015) is the only approach we are aware of that considers more than one sentence. However, it is less expressive than ours, as it only extracts features from the preceding and subsequent sentence without any notion of structure. Neural network-based approaches include an LSTM that determines sentiment towards a target word based on its position (Tang et al., 2015) as well as a recursive neural network that requires parse trees (Nguyen and Shirai, 2015). In contrast, our model requires no feature engineering, no positional information, and no parser outputs, which are often unavailable for low-resource languages. We are also the first – to our knowledge – to frame sentiment analysis as a sequence tagging task.\nHierarchical models. Hierarchical models have been used predominantly for representation learning and generation of paragraphs and documents: Li et al. (2015) use a hierarchical LSTM-based autoencoder to reconstruct reviews and paragraphs of Wikipedia articles. Serban et al. (2016) use a hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder with latent variables for dialogue generation. Denil et al. (2014) use a hierarchical ConvNet to extract salient sentences from reviews, while Kotzias et al. (2015) use the same architecture to learn sentence-level labels from review-level labels using a novel cost function. The model of Lee and Dernoncourt (2016) is perhaps the most similar to ours. While they also use a sentencelevel LSTM, their class-level feed-forward neural network is only able to consider a limited number of preceding texts, while our review-level bidirectional LSTM is (theoretically) able to consider an unlimited number of preceding and successive sentences."

Aspects consist of an entity and an attribute, e.g. FOOD#QUALITY. Similarly to the entity representation of Socher et al.

We remove sentences with no aspect8 and ignore predictions for all sentences that have been added as padding to a review so as not to force our model to learn meaningless predictions, as is commonly done in sequenceto-sequence learning (Sutskever et al., 2014). We segment Chinese data before tokenization.\nWe train our model to minimize the cross-entropy loss, using stochastic gradient descent, the Adam update rule (Kingma and Ba, 2015), mini-batches of size 10, and early stopping with a patience of 10."

Overall, our model compares favorably to the state-of-the-art, particularly for low-resource languages, where few hand-engineered features are available. It outperforms the state-of-the-art on four and five datasets using randomly initialized and pre-trained embeddings respectively.\n9To ensure that the additional parameters do not account for the difference, we increase the number of layers and dimensions of LSTM, which does not impact the results."

      "heading" : "5.2 Leveraging additional information",
      "text" : "As annotation is expensive in many real-world applications, learning from only few examples is important. Our model was designed with this goal in mind and is able to extract additional information inherent in the training data. By leveraging the structure of the review, our model is able to inform and improve its sentiment predictions as evidenced in Table 2.\nThe large performance differential to the state-ofthe-art for the Turkish dataset where only 1104 sentences are available for training and the performance gaps for high-resource languages such as English, Spanish, and French, however, indicate the limits of an approach such as ours that only uses data available at training time.\nWhile using pre-trained word embeddings is an 10https://s3.amazonaws.com/aylien-main/\ndata/multilingual-embeddings/index.html\neffective way to mitigate this deficit, for highresource languages, solely leveraging unsupervised language information is not enough to perform onpar with approaches that make use of large external resources (Kumar et al., 2016) and meticulously hand-crafted features (Brun et al., 2016).\nSentiment lexicons are a popular way to inject additional information into models for sentiment analysis. We experimented with using sentiment lexicons by Kumar et al. (2016) but were not able to significantly improve upon our results with pre-trained embeddings11. In light of the diversity of domains in the context of aspect-based sentiment analysis and many other applications, domain-specific lexicons (Hamilton et al., 2016) are often preferred. Finding better ways to incorporate such domain-specific resources into models as well as methods to inject other forms of domain information, e.g. by constraining them with rules (Hu et al., 2016) is thus an important research avenue, which we leave for future work."

Our model achieves state-ofthe-art results on 5 out of 11 datasets for aspectbased sentiment analysis."

Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even though they form part of a review’s argumentative structure. Intuitively, sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five multilingual, multi-domain datasets without any handengineered features or external resources.",
