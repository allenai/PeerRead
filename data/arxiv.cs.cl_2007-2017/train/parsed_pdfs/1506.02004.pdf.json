      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Distributed representations of words have been shown to benefit NLP tasks like parsing (Lazaridou et al., 2013; Bansal et al., 2014), named entity recognition (Guo et al., 2014), and sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013). The attraction of word vectors is that they can be derived directly from raw, unannotated corpora. Intrinsic evaluations on various tasks are guiding methods toward discovery of a representation that captures many facts about lexical semantics (Turney, 2001; Turney and Pantel, 2010).\nYet word vectors do not look anything like the representations described in most lexical semantic theories, which focus on identifying classes of words (Levin, 1993; Baker et al., 1998; Schuler, 2005) and relationships among word meanings (Miller, 1995). Though expensive to construct, conceptualizing word meanings symbolically is important for theoretical understanding and also\nwhen we incorporate lexical semantics into computational models where interpretability is desired. On the surface, discrete theories seem incommensurate with the distributed approach, a problem now receiving much attention in computational linguistics (Lewis and Steedman, 2013; Kiela and Clark, 2013; Vecchi et al., 2013; Grefenstette, 2013; Lewis and Steedman, 2014; Paperno et al., 2014).\nOur contribution to this discussion is a new, principled sparse coding method that transforms any distributed representation of words into sparse vectors, which can then be transformed into binary vectors (§2). Unlike recent approaches of incorporating semantics in distributional word vectors (Yu and Dredze, 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Faruqui et al., 2015), the method does not rely on any external information source. The transformation results in longer, sparser vectors, sometimes called an “overcomplete” representation (Olshausen and Field, 1997). Sparse, overcomplete representations have been motivated in other domains as a way to increase separability and interpretability, with each instance (here, a word) having a small number of active dimensions (Olshausen and Field, 1997; Lewicki and Sejnowski, 2000), and to increase stability in the presence of noise (Donoho et al., 2006).\nOur work builds on recent explorations of sparsity as a useful form of inductive bias in NLP and machine learning more broadly (Kazama and Tsujii, 2003; Goodman, 2004; Friedman et al., 2008; Glorot et al., 2011; Yogatama and Smith, 2014, inter alia). Introducing sparsity in word vector dimensions has been shown to improve dimension interpretability (Murphy et al., 2012; Fyshe et al., 2014) and usability of word vectors as features in downstream tasks (Guo et al., 2014). The word vectors we produce are more than 90% sparse; we also consider binarizing transformations that bring them closer to the categories and relations of lex-\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n02 00\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nJ un\n2 01\n5\nical semantic theories. Using a number of stateof-the-art word vectors as input, we find consistent benefits of our method on a suite of standard benchmark evaluation tasks (§3). We also evaluate our word vectors in a word intrusion experiment with humans (Chang et al., 2009) and find that our sparse vectors are more interpretable than the original vectors (§4).\nWe anticipate that sparse, binary vectors can play an important role as features in statistical NLP models, which still rely predominantly on discrete, sparse features whose interpretability enables error analysis and continued development. We have made an implementation of our method publicly available.1"

The one on the top, method A, converts dense vectors to sparse overcomplete vectors (§2.1).

In the following, X ∈ RL×V is the matrix constructed by stacking V non-sparse “input” word vectors of length L (produced by an arbitrary word vector estimator).

To obtain sparse word representations we will impose an `1\n1https://github.com/mfaruqui/ sparse-coding\npenalty on A.

To obtain nonnegative sparse word vectors, we use a variation of the nonnegative sparse coding method (Hoyer, 2002). Nonnegative sparse coding further constrains the problem in Eq. 2 so that D and ai are nonnegative. Here, we apply this constraint only to the representation vectors {ai}. Thus, the new objective for nonnegative sparse vectors becomes:\narg min D∈RL×K≥0 ,A∈R K×V ≥0 V∑ i=1 ‖xi−Dai‖22+λ‖ai‖1+τ‖D‖22 (3) This problem will play a role in our second approach, method B, to which we will return shortly. This nonnegativity constraint can be easily incorporated during optimization, as explained next."

In order to speed up training we use asynchronous updates to the parameters of the model in parallel for every word vector (Duchi et al., 2012; Heigold et al., 2014).\nHowever, directly applying stochastic subgradient descent to an `1-regularized objective fails to produce sparse solutions in bounded time, which has motivated several specialized algorithms that target such objectives. We use the AdaGrad variant of one such learning algorithm, the regularized dual averaging algorithm (Xiao, 2009), which keeps track of the online average gradient at time t: ḡt = 1t ∑t t′=1 gt′ Here, the subgradients do not include terms for the regularizer; they are derivatives of the unregularized objective (λ = 0, τ = 0)\nwith respect to ai. We define\nγ = −sign(ḡt,i,j) ηt√ Gt,i,j (|ḡt,i,j | − λ),\nwhere Gt,i,j = ∑t t′=1 g 2 t′,i,j . Now, using the average gradient, the `1-regularized objective is optimized as follows:\nat+1,i,j = { 0, if |ḡt,i,j | ≤ λ γ, otherwise\n(4)\nwhere, at+1,i,j is the jth element of sparse vector ai at the tth update and ḡt,i,j is the corresponding average gradient. For obtaining nonnegative sparse vectors we take projection of the updated ai onto RK≥0 by choosing the closest point in RK≥0 according to Euclidean distance (which corresponds to zeroing out the negative elements):\nat+1,i,j =  0, if |ḡt,i,j | ≤ λ 0, if γ < 0 γ, otherwise\n(5)"

Then, in order to avoid an expensive computation, we take the nonnegative word vectors obtained using Eq. 3 and project nonzero values to 1, preserving the 0 values.

      "text" : "Word intrusion experiments seek to quantify the extent to which dimensions of a learned word representation are coherent to humans. In one instance of the experiment, a human judge is presented with five words in random order and asked to select the “intruder.” The words are selected by the experimenter by choosing one dimension j of the learned representation, then ranking the words on that dimension alone. The dimensions are chosen in decreasing order of the variance of their values across the vocabulary. Four of the words are the top-ranked words according to j, and the “true” intruder is a word from the bottom half of the list, chosen to be a word that appears in the top 10% of some other dimension. An example of an instance is:\nnaval, industrial, technological, marine, identity\n(The last word is the intruder.) We formed instances from initializing vectors and from our sparse overcomplete vectors (A). Each of these two combines the four different initializers X. We selected the 25 dimensions d in each case. Each of the 100 instances per condition (initial vs. sparse overcomplete) was given to three judges.\nResults in Table 5 confirm that the sparse overcomplete vectors are more interpretable than the dense vectors. The inter-annotator agreement on the sparse vectors increases substantially, from 57% to 71%, and the Fleiss’ κ increases from “fair” to “moderate” agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)."

Subjectively, we find the semantic groupings better in the sparse vectors than in the initial vectors.\nFigure 3 visualizes the sparsified GC vectors for six words. The dimensions are sorted by the average value across the three “animal” vectors.

These vectors were trained on 6 billion words from Wikipedia and English Gigaword and are of length 300.3\n3http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/ glove/\nSkip-Gram (SG). The word2vec tool (Mikolov et al., 2013) is fast and widely-used. In this model, each word’s Huffman code is used as an input to a log-linear classifier with a continuous projection layer and words within a given context window are predicted. These vectors were trained on 100 billion words of Google news data and are of length 300.4\nGlobal Context (GC). These vectors are learned using a recursive neural network that incorporates both local and global (documentlevel) context features (Huang et al., 2012). These vectors were trained on the first 1 billion words of English Wikipedia and are of length 50.5\nMultilingual (Multi). Faruqui and Dyer (2014) learned vectors by first performing SVD on text in different languages, then applying canonical correlation analysis on pairs of vectors for words that align in parallel corpora. These vectors were trained on WMT-2011 news corpus containing 360 million words and are of length 48.6"

      "heading" : "B Evaluation Benchmarks",
      "text" : "Our comparisons of word vector quality consider five benchmark tasks. We now describe the different evaluation benchmarks for word vectors.\nWord Similarity. We evaluate our word representations on two word similarity tasks. The first is the WS-353 dataset (Finkelstein et al., 2001), which contains 353 pairs of English words that have been assigned similarity ratings by humans. This dataset is used to tune sparse vector learning hyperparameters (§2.5), while the remaining of the tasks discussed in this section are completely held out.\n4https://code.google.com/p/word2vec 5http://nlp.stanford.edu/˜socherr/\nACL2012_wordVectorsTextFile.zip 6http://cs.cmu.edu/˜mfaruqui/soft.html\nA more recent dataset, SimLex-999 (Hill et al., 2014), has been constructed to specifically focus on similarity (rather than relatedness). It contains a balanced set of noun, verb, and adjective pairs. We calculate cosine similarity between the vectors of two words forming a test item and report Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Myers and Well, 1995) between the rankings produced by our model against the human rankings.\nSentiment Analysis (Senti). Socher et al. (2013) created a treebank of sentences annotated with fine-grained sentiment labels on phrases and sentences from movie review excerpts. The coarse-grained treebank of positive and negative classes has been split into training, development, and test datasets containing 6,920, 872, and 1,821 sentences, respectively. We use average of the word vectors of a given sentence as feature for classification. The classifier is tuned on the dev. set and accuracy is reported on the test set.\nQuestion Classification (TREC). As an aid to question answering, a question may be classified as belonging to one of many question types. The TREC questions dataset involves six different question types, e.g., whether the question is about a location, about a person, or about some numeric information (Li and Roth, 2002). The training dataset consists of 5,452 labeled questions, and the test dataset consists of 500 questions. An average of the word vectors of the input question is used as features and accuracy is reported on the test set.\n20 Newsgroup Dataset. We consider three binary categorization tasks from the 20 Newsgroups dataset.7 Each task involves categorizing a document according to two related categories with training/dev./test split in accordance with Yogatama and Smith (2014): (1) Sports: baseball vs. hockey (958/239/796) (2) Comp.: IBM vs. Mac (929/239/777) (3) Religion: atheism vs. christian (870/209/717). We use average of the word vectors of a given sentence as features. The classifier is tuned on the dev. set and accuracy is reported on the test set.\nNP bracketing (NP). Lazaridou et al. (2013) constructed a dataset from the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) of noun phrases (NP) of\n7http://qwone.com/˜jason/20Newsgroups\nlength three words, where the first can be an adjective or a noun and the other two are nouns. The task is to predict the correct bracketing in the parse tree for a given noun phrase. For example, local (phone company) and (blood pressure) medicine exhibit right and left bracketing, respectively. We append the word vectors of the three words in the NP in order and use them as features for binary classification. The dataset contains 2,227 noun phrases split into 10 folds. The classifier is tuned on the first fold and cross-validation accuracy is reported on the remaining nine folds."

The former are dense and uninterpretable, the latter largely based on familiar, discrete classes (e.g., supersenses) and relations (e.g., synonymy and hypernymy). We propose methods that transform word vectors into sparse (and optionally binary) vectors. The resulting representations are more similar to the interpretable features typically used in NLP, though they are discovered automatically from raw corpora. Because the vectors are highly sparse, they are computationally easy to work with. Most importantly, we find that they outperform the original vectors on benchmark tasks.",
