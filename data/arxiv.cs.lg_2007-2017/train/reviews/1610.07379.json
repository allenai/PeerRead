The algorithm greedily shrinks a sum of truncated variances within a set of potential maximizers (BO) or unclassified points (LSE), which is updated based on confidence bounds. TruVaR is effective in several important settings that are typically non-trivial to incorporate into myopic algorithms, including pointwise costs and heteroscedastic noise. We provide a general theoretical guarantee for TruVaR covering these aspects, and use it to recover and strengthen existing results on BO and LSE. Moreover, we provide a new result for a setting where one can select from a number of noise levels having associated costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 12:18:00 GMT  (2536kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07379v1", "Accepted to NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["ilija bogunovic", "jonathan scarlett", "andreas krause 0001", "volkan cevher"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.07379"}
