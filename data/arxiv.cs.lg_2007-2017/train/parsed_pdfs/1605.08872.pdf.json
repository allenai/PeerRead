      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) has been actively explored in recent years [Wang and Blei, 2011]. Instead of purely relying on Collaboretive Filgering(CF) approaches, CTR aims to leverages content-based techniques to overcome inaccurate and unreliable predictions with traditional CF methods due to data sparsity and other challenges. More specifically, CTR combines the idea of probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) [Mnih and Salakhutdinov, 2007] for predicting ratings, and the idea of probabilistic topic modeling, e.g., Latent Dirchelet Allocation (LDA), for analyzing the content of items towards recommendation tasks. CTR has been shown as a promising method that produces more accurate and interpretable results and has been successfully applied in many recommender systems, such\nas tag recommendation [Wang et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2015], and social recommender systems [Purushotham et al., 2012; Kang and Lerman, 2013].\nDespite being studied actively [Wang and Blei, 2011; Wang et al., 2013], the existing CTR techniques suffer from several critical limitations. First of all, they are often designed to work in a batch mode learning fashion, by assuming that all text contents of items as well as the rating training data are given prior to the learning tasks. During the training process, both LDA and PMF models are usually trained separately in a batch training fashion. Such an approach would suffer from a huge scalability drawback when new data (users or items) may arrive sequentially and get updated frequently in a realworld online recommender system. Second, the existing CTR approach only leverages the content information to improve the CF tasks, but not reverse. The document-specific topic proportions of LDA are fed to the downstream PMF. This two-step procedure is rather suboptimal as the the rating information is not used in discovering the low-dimensional representation of documents, which is clearly not an optimal representation for prediction as the two methods are not tightly coupled to fully exploit their potential. Our work is motivated to explore more efficient, scalable, and effective techniques to maximize the potential exploiting extremes in dealing with data streams from real-world online recommender systems.\nTo overcome the limitations of traditional CTR, we propose a novel scheme of Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR), which jointly optimizes a unified objective function by combining both PMF and LDA in an online learning fashion. In contrast to the original CTR model, OBCTR is able to achieve a much tighter coupling of both PMF and LDA, where both LDA and PMF tasks influence each other naturally and gradually via the joint optimization in the online learning process. This interplay yields item representations that are more suitable for making accurate and reliable rating prediction tasks.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the proposed OBCTR algorithm is the first online learning algorithm for solving CTR tasks with fully joint optimization of both LDA and PMF. Our encouraging results from extensive experiments on a large real-world data set show that the proposed online learning algorithms are scalable and effective, and the OBCTR technique not only outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for rating prediction tasks but also yields more suitable latent\ntopic proportions in topic modeling tasks. In the following, we first review some important related work, then present a formal formulation of CTR tasks and the novel Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression algorithms. After that, we conduct extensive empirical studies and compare the proposed algorithms with the existing techniques, and finally set out our conclusions of this work."

      "text" : "In this section, we review two groups of studies related to our work, including (1) variants of CTR models and (2) online Bayesian inference.\nVariants of CTR model: Researchers have extended CTR models to different applications of recommender systems. Some researchers extended CTR models by integrating with other side information. In CTRsmf [Purushotham et al., 2012], authors integrated CTR with social matrix factorization models to take social correlation between users into account. In LA-CTR [Kang and Lerman, 2013], they assumed that users divide their limited attention non-uniformly over other people. In HFT [McAuley and Leskovec, 2013], they aligned hidden factors in product ratings with hidden topics in product reviews for product recommendations. Some researchers extended CTR to other recommendation tasks. In CSTR [Ding et al., 2013], authors explored how to recommend celebrities to general users in the context of social network. In CTR-SR [Wang et al., 2013], authors adapted CTR model by combining both item-tag matrix and item content information for tag recommendation tasks. There were also several works that attempted to extract latent topic proportions of text information in CTR via deep learning techniques [Wang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Van den Oord et al., 2013]. However, all of these work follow the same parameter estimation scheme as [Wang and Blei, 2011] in a batch learning mode.\nOnline Bayesian Inference: Although the classical regime of online learning is based on decision theory, much progress has been made for developing online variational Bayes [Hoffman et al., 2010; Hoffman et al., 2013; Kingma and Welling, 2013; Foulds et al., 2013]. Most of them have adopted stochastic approximation of posterior distribution by sub-sampling a given finite data set, which is unsuitable for many applications where data size is unknown in advance.\nTo relax this assumption, researchers in [Broderick et al., 2013; Ghahramani and Attias, 2000] made streaming updates to the estimated posterior. The intuition behind this idea is that we could treat the posterior after observing T − 1 samples as the new prior for the incoming data points. Specifically, suppose the training data {ot}t≥0 are generated i.i.d. according to a distribution p(o|x) and the prior p(x) is given. Bayes’ theorem implies the posterior distribution of x given the first T samples (T ≥ 1) satisfies p(x|{o}Tt=0) ∝ p(x|{o} T−1 t=0 )p(oT |x). For complex models, we can use approximate inference methods to compute the posterior. For example, [Broderick et al., 2013] explored a mean-field variational Bayes algorithm for LDA inference. In\naddition, [McInerney et al., 2015] introduced the population Variational Bayes (PVB) method which combines traditional Bayesian inference with the frequentist idea of the population distribution for streaming inference. [Shi and Zhu, 2014] proposed the Online Bayesian Passive-Aggressive (BayesPA) method for max-margin Bayesian inference of online streaming data. The high scalability of the above methods motivates us to propose Online Bayesian inference for CTR models."

      "text" : "Suppose there are I users and J items. Each data sample is a 3-tuple (i, j, rij) where i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , I} is the user index, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , J} is the item index and rij ∈ R is the rating value assigned to item j by user i. We assume the rating data arrives sequentially in an online recommender system. Let R denote the whole rating samples and the collection of J items is regarded as a document set W = {wj}Jj=1. Let Z = {zj}Jj=1 and Θ = {θj} J j=1 denote all the topic assignments and topic proportions of each item. We represent users and items in a shared latent low-dimensional space of dimension K , which is equal to the number of topics, user i is represented by a latent vector ui ∈ RK and item j by a latent vector vj ∈ RK .\nFigure 1(a) shows the graphical model of CTR. Basically, the CTR model assumes that each item is generated by a topic model and additionally includes a latent variable ǫj which offsets the topic proportions θj when modeling the user’s latent vector. This offset variable ǫj can capture the item preference of a particular user based on their ratings. Assume there are K topics Φ = {φk}Kk=1. The generative process of the CTR model is as follows:\n1. For each user i, draw user latent vector ui ∼ N (0,\n1 σ2u IK)\n2. For each item j,\n(a) Draw topic proportions θj ∼ Dirichlet(α). (b) Draw item latent offset ǫj ∼ N (0, 1σ2ǫ IK)) and set the item latent vector as vj = ǫj + θj .\n(c) For each word wjn(1 ≤ n ≤ Nj), i. Draw topic assignment zjn ∼ Mult(θj). ii. Draw word wjn ∼ Mult(φzjn).\n3. For each user-item pair (i, j), draw the rating rij ∼ N (uTi vj ,\n1 σ2r ).\nIn step 2 (c) ii. φzjn denotes the topic selected by the non-zero entry of zjn. The topics are random samples drawn from a prior, e.g., φk ∼ Dirichlet(β). Note that vj = ǫj + θj , where ǫj ∼ N (0, 1σ2ǫ IK), is equivalent to vj ∼ N (θj , 1 σ2ǫ IK). Given the document set W and rating data R, we let U = {ui}Ii=1,V = {vj} J j=1, the goal of CTR is to infer the posterior distribution p(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ|W,R) ∝ p0(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ)\np(W|Z,Φ)p(Z|Θ)p(V|Θ)p(R|U,V). (1) Because computing the full posterior of U,V,Z,Φ,Θ directly is intractable, CTR proposed a heuristic two-stage batch learning method for approximate inference . First,\nCTR approximately infers posterior p(Z,Φ,Θ|W) of LDA model via variational inference method [Blei et al., 2003]. Then, it applies ALS algorithm 1 for learning the posterior p(U,V|R,Θ) of PMF model by feeding the results of Θ in the first step. This batch learning approach only leverages the content information to improve the CF tasks, but not reverse and tends to get trapped into local optimum."

      "text" : "Before introducing our novel online parameter estimation method of Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR), we first modify the graphical model of CTR as shown in Figure 1 to jointly optimize both LDA and PMF and adapt to our online learning method. It is worth noting that this minor modification 1(b) does not break the main structure of CTR, and our online parameter estimation method could be applied to the various variants of CTR introduced in Section 2.\nCTR depicts the generative process of vj with vj ∼ N (θj ,\n1 σ2ǫ IK). In their parameter estimation method, topic\nproportions θj (result of LDA) provide features for vj in PMF, but information flow is one-way, which ignores that vj could provide feedback to guide the extraction of topic proportions θj (they estimates θj via traditional LDA algorithm which only based on W not vj ). To address this limitation, we first assume that the item latent vector vj is directly close to z̄j , where z̄j is a vector with element z̄j = 1 N ∑N n=1 I(z k n = 1) and I is the indicator function that equals to 1 if predicate holds otherwise 0. In this way, vj can directly influence topic assignments zj during the procedure of inferring LDA model (variable zj plays a key role in LDA since other hidden variable Φ and Θ depend on zj\n1CTR adopts the ALS algorithm [Hu et al., 2008] to solve an implicit feedback problem. In our context, we use the SGD algorithm [Koren et al., 2009] since ratings data are explicit.\nand we can easily derive the update rule of them based on zj). Second, we replace the generative process of p(vj |θj) with p(ǫj|z̄j ,vj), ǫj ∼ N (vj − z̄j , 1σ2ǫ IK), as shown in Figure 1. In our setting, vj and z̄j are conditionally dependent, which means their probability of occurrence depends on either event’s occurrence and allows two-way interation. In addition, instead of learning two point estimates of coefficients ui,vj , we take a more general Bayesian-style approach and learn the posterior distribution q(ui,vj) in an online method. For rating prediction, we take a weighted average over all the possible latent vectors ui and vj , or more precisely, an expectation of the prediction over q(ui,vj) which is defined as r̂ij , E[u ⊤ i vj ].\nFinally, Algorithm 1 summarizes the detailed framework of the proposed OBCTR algorithm. At each round t, we receive data sample and update both the parameters of LDA and PMF. The following discusses the optimization and each step of the algorithm in detail.\nAlgorithm 1 The Online Bayesian CTR (OBCTR) Initialize U,V,Z randomly. for t = 1 to ∞ do\nReceive data sample (i, j, rij ,wj) Draw samples ztj from Eq. (8) DiscardB burn-in sweeps, use the rest samples to update ui,vj ,Φ following Eq. (5),(6),(7)\nend for Output: U,V and Z\nNow, we propose our novel online parameter estimation method of Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR) which is efficient and scalable for learning from data streams. Let us first review the objective function of CTR defined in (1), from a variational point of view, this posterior is identical to the solution of the following optimization\nproblem: min\nq(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ) KL[q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ)‖p0(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ))]\n− Eq[log p(W|Z,Φ)p(V|Θ)p(R|U,V)]\ns.t. q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ) ∈ P , (2) where KL(q‖p) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and P is the space of probability distributions. If we add the constant log p(W)p(R) to the objective, it is the minimization of KL(q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ)‖p(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ|W,R)), which is similar with the variational formulation of original LDA [Blei et al., 2003]. Formally, we formulate our OBCTR model as the optimization problem below:\nmin q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ) KL[q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ)‖p0(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ))]\n− Eq[log p(W|Z,Φ)p(ǫ|Z,V)p(R|U,V)]\ns.t. q(U,V,Z,Φ,Θ) ∈ P , (3)\nwhere p(ǫ|Z,Θ) = ∏J\nj=1 p(ǫj |z̄j ,vj). Inspired by streaming Bayesian inference [Broderick et al., 2013; Ghahramani and Attias, 2000], on the arrival of new data (i, j, rij ,wj), if we treat the posterior after observing t − 1 samples as the new prior, the post-data posterior distribution qt+1(ui,vj , zj ,Φ,Θ) is equivalent to the solution of the following optimization problem:\nmin q KL[q(ui,vj , zj ,Φ,Θ)‖qt(ui,vj , zj ,Φ,Θ))]\n− Eq[log p(wj|zj ,Φ)p(ǫj |z̄j ,vj)p(rij |u ⊤ i vj)]\ns.t. q(ui,vj , zj ,Φ,Θ) ∈ P . (4) This problem is intractable to compute. With the mean field assumption that q(ui,vj , zj) = q(ui)q(vj)q(zj), we can solve this problem via an iterative procedure that alternatively updates each factor distribution as follows in detail.\nFor ui: By fixing the distribution q(vj), we can ignore irrelevant terms and solve\nmin q(ui)\nKL[q(ui)q(vj)‖qt(ui)p(rij |u ⊤ i vj)].\nThe optimal solution has the following closed form solution: qt+1(ui) ∝ qt(ui) exp(Eq(vj)[log p(rij |u ⊤ i vj)]). If initial prior is normal q0(ui) = N (ui;m0ui,Σ 0 ui), by induction we can show that the inferred distribution at each round is also a normal distribution. Let us assume qt(ui) = N (ui;mtui,Σ t ui). Then, we have\nqt+1(ui)∝ exp(− 1\n2 (ui −m\nt ui) ⊤(Σtui) −1(ui −m t ui)\n+Eq(vj)[− (ri,j − u\n⊤ i vj) 2\n2σ2r ])\n= N (ui;m ∗ ui,Σ ∗ ui),\nwhere the posterior parameters are computed as\nΣ∗ui = ((Σ t ui) −1 + mvjm\n⊤ vj\nσ2rIK )−1, (5)\nm ∗ ui = m t ui +\nri,j −m ⊤ vjm t ui\nσ2r +m ⊤ vjΣ t uimvj\nΣtuimvj .\nTo make it more efficient, we only update the diagonals of covariance matrix Σ∗ui.\nFor vj: The update rule of vj is similar to ui except adding a Gaussian distribution p(ǫj |z̄j ,vj), a constraint about the distance between vj and z̄j , that explains the dif-\nference between topic assignments in content and item preference based on ratings. By fixing the distribution of q(ui) and q(zj), we have the update rule qt+1(vj) ∝ qt(vj) exp(Eq(ui,zj)[log p(rij |u ⊤ i vj)p(ǫj |z̄j ,vj)])\n∝ exp(− 1\n2 (vj −m\nt vj) ⊤(Σtvj) −1(vj −m t vj)\n+Eq(ui)q(zj)[− (ri,j − u\n⊤ i vj) 2\n2σ2r − (z̄j − vj)\n⊤(z̄j − vj)\nσ2ǫ IK ])\n= N (vj ;m ∗ vj ,Σ ∗ vj),\nwhere the posterior parameters are computed as\nΣmix = (Σ −1 vj +\n1\nσ2ǫ )−1, (6)\nΣ∗vj = ((Σ t vj) −1 + 1\nσ2ǫ IK +\nmuim ⊤ ui\nσ2rIK )−1,\nm ∗ vj = ΣmixΣ −1 vj m t vj + Σmix\n1\nσ2ǫ z̄j − Σmix\n1\nσ2r mui\n( m\n⊤ uiΣmixΣ −1 vj m t vj +m ⊤ uiΣmix 1 σ2ǫ z̄j − rij\n1 +m⊤uiΣmix 1 σ2r\nmui ).\nBesides, we adopt the same strategy that only updating the diagonals of covariance matrix Σ∗vj .\nFor Φ and Θ: By fixing the distribution q(Z), the update rule for Dirichlet distribution Φ and Θ is similar to the original LDA, that is,\nθjk = Ckj + α∑K\nk=1 C k j +Kα\n, Φkw = Cwk + β∑D\nw=1 C w k +Dβ\n, (7)\nwhere D is the vocabulary size, Ckj is the number of times that terms being associated with topic k within the j-th item, Cwk is the number of times the term w(1 ≤ w ≤ D) being assigned to topic k over the whole corpus.\nFor zj: Given the distribution of other variables, the conditional distribution of zj is: qt+1(zj |vj ,Φ,wj)\n∝ qt(zj) exp(Eq(Φ)q(vj )[log p(wj|zj ,Φ)p(ǫj|z̄j ,vj)]) ∝ qt(zt) exp( ∑\nn∈[Nj ]\nΛzjn,wjn − Eq(vj)[ (vj − z̄j)\n⊤(vj − z̄j)\nσ2ǫ IK ])\nwhere Λzjn,wjn = Eq(Φ)[log(Φzjn,wjn)]. We can do Gibbs sampling to infer q(zj) by canceling out common factors. This hybird strategy has shown promising performance for LDA [Mimno et al., 2012; Shi and Zhu, 2014]. Specifically, the conditional distribution of one varibale zjn (the topic assignment of the n-th word in item j ) given others zj¬n is q(zjn = k|zj¬n,vj ,Φ, wjn = w) (8)\n∝ (α+ Ckj¬n) exp(Λk,wjn + 1\n2σ2ǫNj (2mvjk − 1 + 2Ckj¬n Nj )),\nwhere zj¬n is the topic assignments in item j (except the nth word) and Ckj¬n is the number of words in item j (except the n-th word) that are assigned to topic k."

We then combine the “plot summary” text together with each movie’s title and category text given in the MovieLens-10M dataset as a text document to represent each movie. For detailed text preprocessing, we follow the same procedure as the one described in [Wang and Blei, 2011] to process text information. Finally, we form a vocabulary with 7,689 distinct words. Note that we did not consider the CiteUlike dataset 5 as used in the previous study [Wang and Blei, 2011], because their dataset only provides “like” and “dislike” preference, which is kind of implicit feedback and thus unsuitable for our regression task.

We note that the CTR method took at least 6 hours 6 to precompute the parameters Θ and Φ by a batch variational inference algorithm. Figure 2 shows only its performance in the downstream collaborative filtering phase.\nAs we can see from Figure 2(a),2(b),2(c), the CTRbased approaches outperform the online CF algorithm (PAI) for most cases, which is in line the experiments in [Wang and Blei, 2011] and validates the efficacy of leveraging additional text information to improve the performance of PMF for online rating prediction tasks. Second, among different CTR-based approaches, the proposed OBCTR consistently outperforms the other algorithms for most cases. This validates the importance of jointly optimizing both online PMF and online LDA to achieve tight coupling of the two techniques. Moreover, it is interesting to find that the gap between the proposed OCTR variant and OBCTR tends to become more significant when K is smaller. We conjecture that this is because when K is small, the PMF performance is relatively inaccurate and thus including the joint optimization becomes more critical for enhancing the unreliable PMF prediction performance.\n6For the vanilla LDA inference method, a larger K value often needs more time for computation.\nFinally, Table 1 summarizes the final test-set RMSE results after finishing the whole online learning tasks (by a single pass over the training set). Similar observations can be found , in which OBCTR achieves the lowest RMSE result on the test set for rating prediction among all the algorithms. In addition, CTR has better performance than OCTR. This is because CTR directly takes the batch LDA results (precomputed Θ and Φ) as input for leveraging online PMF task, while online CTR may converge relatively slowly (without the tight coupling). This again shows that it is crucial for the joint optimization in OBCTR."

This investigation is done by selecting the best achievable RMSE and log-likelihood during the grid parameter search process.

First of all, they are often designed to work in a batch learning manner, making them unsuitable to deal with streaming data or big data in real-world recommender systems. Second, the document-specific topic proportions of LDA are fed to the downstream PMF, but not reverse, which is sub-optimal as the rating information is not exploited in discovering the lowdimensional representation of documents and thus can result in a sub-optimal representation for prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of Online Bayesian Collaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR) which is efficient and scalable for learning from data streams. Particularly, we jointly optimize the combined objective function of both PMF and LDA in an online learning fashion, in which both PMF and LDA tasks can be reinforced each other during the online learning process. Our encouraging experimental results on real-world data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
