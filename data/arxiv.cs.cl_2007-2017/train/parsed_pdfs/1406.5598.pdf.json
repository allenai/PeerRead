      "text" : "DOI : 10.5121/ijnlc.2014.3203 33\nText classification is a task of automatic classification of text into one of the predefined categories. The problem of text classification has been widely studied in different communities like natural language processing, data mining and information retrieval. Text classification is an important constituent in many information management tasks like topic identification, spam filtering, email routing, language identification, genre classification, readability assessment etc. The performance of text classification improves notably when phrase patterns are used. The use of phrase patterns helps in capturing non-local behaviours and thus helps in the improvement of text classification task. Phrase structure extraction is the first step to continue with the phrase pattern identification. In this survey, detailed study of phrase structure learning methods have been carried out. This will enable future work in several NLP tasks, which uses syntactic information from phrase structure like grammar checkers, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, text classification. The paper also provides different levels of classification and detailed comparison of the phrase structure learning methods.\nKEYWORDS\nText classification, Phrase structure, Phrase patterns, Natural Language Processing (NLP)"

      "text" : "Text classification or categorization includes automatic classification of documents or texts into predefined categories. Different application of text classification includes spam filtering, email routing, language identification, genre classification, readability assessment etc. There are different methods for text classification which includes decision trees [2], rule based classifiers [5], SVM classifiers [7], neural network classifiers [4], bayesian classifiers [3] and nearest neighbour classifiers [1]. Text classification can be improved if phrase patterns are used in the classification task and phrase pattern identification progresses with already extracted phrases.\nPhrase structure is the grammatical arrangement of words in a sentence. The words in a sentence are not arranged in just any order, but language has constraints on word order. Words are organized into phrases, groupings of words that are clumped as a unit and a sentence can be modeled as a set of phrases. Syntactic knowledge can be modeled by phrase structure. Phrase\nstructure is the backbone of many models of syntax of natural language. It can be a powerful way to express sophisticated relations among the words in a sentence. NLP activities like grammar checkers, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, text classification uses syntax information form phrase structure.\nThe advantage of using phrase patterns for text classification is that phrases helps to identify long distant dependencies, the structure can support distant relationships between words. This method provides flexibilities of modeling local word-reordering or grouping which is the main problem of free order languages. Also, phrase extraction brings in some semantic value, which is suitable when NLP activities like text classification, or machine translation is considered. Another advantage of the phrase pattern identification is that it filters words occurring frequently in isolation that does not have much weight towards classification. The different methods of phrase structure learning or extraction have to be studied, classified and compared."

      "text" : "N-gram based approach is a statistical approach which includes application of n-gram models to obtain phrases. William B. Cavnar and John M. Trenkle proposed an approach which extracted phrases using n-gram model and the phrases thus obtained are used for text categorization [6]. Gulila Altenbek, Ruina Sun used N-gram models for phrase structure extraction from unannotated monolingual corpus [31]. Bigram and trigram models are applied to extract phrases from the corpus. The monolingual corpus is roughly segmented and N-gram model is applied followed by a normalization process. Equation (2) represents the probability [31].\nAccuracy is measured in terms of number of phrases correct to total phrases extracted. The accuracy is measured around 51%, which is low. Among the two models, bigram model has more accuracy than trigram [31]."

Gulila Altenbek, Ruina Sun used rule based method [31] for noun phrase extraction from monolingual corpus. The method is a non-statistical approach which uses annotated monolingual corpus. The approach is based on the basic rules of the target monolingual language; therefore developing a rule set for the corresponding language is a necessary condition. The phrases are extracted according to the rules defined, the corpus is searched for a matched rule and the phrases thus found are extracted.\nAccuracy is measured in terms of number of phrases correct to total phrases extracted. The accuracy for rule based approach is found to be around 80% while that of N-gram based approach is found to be around 51%.\n(2)"

      "heading" : "2.3. Word alignment based method",
      "text" : "Word alignment based method is a statistical method. Phrase alignments are learned from a corpus that has been word aligned. The basic idea is to align the parallel corpus in both directions and to take an intersection so that an alignment matrix is generated. The alignment points in the alignment matrix are expanded based on different heuristics.\nFranz Josef Och, Christoph Tillman and Hermann Ney developed an improved alignment model [11] which uses alignment templates. An alignment template is a triple (F,E,A) where A is an alignment matrix with binary values. The template describes the alignment between source class sequence F and target class sequence E. The initial step of the alignment template approach is to align the parallel corpus in the two translation directions, source to target and target to source. Expectation maximization algorithm is applied in both directions to obtain two alignment vectors. The two alignment vectors are combined to form the alignment matrix A. Iteratively checking and adding neighboring links extend the alignment. All the consistent phrase pairs of the training corpus are determined by checking if the source phrase words are aligned only to target phrase words.\nThe advantage of this approach is the fully automatic learning using bilingual training corpus [11]. The disadvantage is that it selects all templates without checking whether it is good or bad [11]. The measuring score used is word error rate (WER), position independent error rate (PER) and subjective sentence error rate (SSER). In terms of efficiency, the error rate decreased to about 6% than baseline.\nPhilip Koehn, Franz Josef Och and Daniel Marcu modified the alignment template approach later [16]. The heuristics for expansion in the alignment template approach is modified by permitting diagonal neighborhood in the expansion stage [5]. Giza++ toolkit is used for word alignment. Lexical weighting and maximum phrase length scores are applied to the model. Top performance is obtained when the phrase length is three. The method shows better performance when lexical weighting score is applied. The method has an improvement of about 0.01 BLEU score than alignment template approach."

      "heading" : "2.4. Phrase alignment based method",
      "text" : "Phrase alignment based method is another statistical approach in which phrases are extracted from the phrase alignment using phrase-based joint probability.\nDaniel Marcu and William Wong developed a phrase based joint probability model [14]. The model captures simultaneous generation of source and target sentences in a parallel corpus rather than alignment between them. In this method, each sentence pair in our corpus is generated by the idea of generation of a bag of concepts (each concept is a phrase pair) and the bag of concepts can be arranged linearly to obtain source and target sentences [14]. The initial step of the method is to find high frequency n-grams and t-distribution table initialization. Expectation maximization learning on the Viterbi alignment is then applied iteratively which yields joint probability distribution. The performance of the phrase-based method has an average improvement of about 0.02 BLEU score than word alignment based method.\nA modification of the base model has been proposed by Philip Koehn, Franz Josef Och and Daniel Marcu [16]. The base model is modified by marginalizing the joint probabilities to conditional probability [16]. The performance of the method is high when phrases are of length three."

      "heading" : "2.5. Syntactic approach",
      "text" : "Philip Koehn, Franz Josef Och and Daniel Marcu proposed a syntactic method [16], which involves parsing of the sentences in bilingual parallel corpus. In this method, a syntactic phrase is defined as a sequence of words which is covered in a single subtree of a syntactic parse tree [15]. The first step of the method is to word align the parallel corpus. Both side of the corpus is parsed using syntactic parsers. For consistent phrase pairs, it is checked whether both the phrases are subtrees in the parse trees generated. The measuring score used is BLEU score. A BLEU score of 0.243 is obtained when efficiency is measured [16].\n2.6.. Mutual Information based method\nYing Zhang, Stephan Vogel and Alex Waibel developed an integrated phrase segmentation and alignment algorithm [17] for statistical machine translation which uses Mutual Information (MI). The algorithm segments sentences into phrases and thus can be used as a phrase extraction technique. In this method, an initial word alignment or initial segmentation on the monolingual text is not required [17]. The phrases are identified by similarity of point wise mutual information and thus the sentences are segmented into phrases. A two dimensional matrix is constructed to represent the source and target sentence pairs where value of each cell corresponds the point wise mutual information score between source and target words. From the matrix, phrase pair with high MI value is selected and it is expanded to rectangle regions such that the expanded region has a similar MI value. The rectangular region is considered as phrase pair. Repeating this step iteratively identifies all the phrase pairs. Equation (1) is used to calculate the point wise mutual information [17]:\nAfter the segmentation of sentence pairs into phrase pairs, joint probabilities are calculated for these phrase pairs using monolingual conditional probability.\nThe advantage of this method is that it does not require to find high frequency N-grams. Precision and length penalty is used as measuring scores here and a confidence level of 99.99% over baseline HMM represents the efficiency of this approach."

The method consists of three phases: generation, scoring, and pruning. In the generation phase, all source phrases are identified using N-gram and all possible candidate target phrases corresponding to source phrases are identified. This set is scored and pruned using various scores to remove unwanted target phrases. In the scoring phase, the phrases are scored using measures from three models, maximum approximation, word based translation lexicon and language specific measures [18]. In the pruning step, maximum likely phrase pairs are selected using maximal separation criteria [18].\nThe advantage of this method is that it is less computationally expensive and recovers well from noisy alignments, but it lacks an explanatory framework. When performance is considered, the method shows a NIST score improvement of 0.05 over baseline HMM word alignment method.\n(1)"

      "heading" : "2.8. Block based method",
      "text" : "Ashish Venugopal, Stephan Vogel and Alex Waibel developed a phrase translation extraction from alignment models in 2005, which is based on blocks [21]. In the block based method [21], phrase pair within parallel sentence is considered as a block. The method does not use alignment. An example of a block is shown in fig.1 [21].\nIn the block, y-axis is the source sentence, x axis is the target sentence. The block is defined by source phrase and its projection, which can be represented as the left and right boundaries in the target sentence. The source phrase is bounded by the start and end positions in the source sentence.\nThree models are used in this method. The first one is Fertility model, which predicts the width of the block by computing phrase length. A dynamic programming algorithm using the source word fertilities is employed in this model and given the candidate target phrase e and a source phrase of length J, the model gives the estimation of P(J/e1). Next is the Distortion model. A simple distortion score is computed to estimate how far away the two centers are in a parallel sentence pair in a sense the block is close to the diagonal [21].Another model is Lexicon model, which is computed for translational equivalence. For each candidate block, using word level lexicon, a score within a given sentence pair is computed.\nFor each candidate block, the scores of phrase length, center based distortion and a lexicon-based score are calculated, which is followed by a local greedy search to find best scored phrase pair. The method is a general framework, in which one could plug in other scores and word alignment to get better results, but the computational expense of this method will be higher."

      "text" : "Rile HU, Chengqing ZONG and Bo XU proposed an approach to automatic acquisition of translation templates which is based on phrase structure extraction and alignment [23]. The method is a statistical and data driven approach [23]. The basic idea of the method is to cluster or group words in the corpus using similarity measure. Clustering is performed in two steps, temporal clustering and spatial clustering. Temporal clustering clusters words or entities, which frequently co occurs, into groups. Frequent co occurrence of entities can be obtained by finding the mutual information score between the word pair or entity pair. Spatial clustering clusters words or entities, which have similar left and right contexts which is measured by the KullbackLeibler distance [23].\nThe initial step of the method is to find the similarity measure in terms of distance for each pair of entities and N-pairs of entities with minimum distance is selected to form semantic class. The entities are then replaced with semantic class label. The next step is to find similarity measure in terms of the Mutual Information for each entity pair and N pairs of entities with highest Mutual Information (MI) are selected to form phrasal structure groups. The entities are replaced with phrasal structure class label. This process is repeated till a stopping criterion (STC) is reached.\nThe method has higher precision, recall and f-score than base approaches Bracketing Transduction Grammar method [8] and parse to parse match[13]. Higher number of phrase groups were obtained when cosine of pointwise mutual information score was used [23]."

      "text" : "Xue Yongzeng and Li Sheng developed a loose phrase extraction method with n-best alignments [28]. The method of loose phrase extraction [28] is based on the idea of extracting phrase pairs that are not strictly consistent with word alignments. In normal phrase extraction techniques, which use bilingual corpora, exact phrase extraction is used, that is, all the phrase pairs that are consistent are extracted. But this method allows some relaxation to the rule of consistency. Loose phrase pairs can be aligned to some words outside, provided that the word is also aligned to some words inside the phrase pair [28]. After phrase extraction, constraints are applied to these loose phrase pairs to avoid ill formed phrase pairs. Main constraints applied are intersection-based constraint and heuristic based constraint. Apart from applying constraints, a union between n-best alignments from each translation direction is collected and the two unions of alignment are combined. The method achieves better performance than baseline exact match approach, also Nbest alignment results on all constraints shows better BLEU score."

This method is a statistical and rule based hybrid approach. The hybrid system inherits the lexicons from both sub-systems as well as other merits of each system [30]. The method uses word alignment method and rule based approach to extract phrases. Phrase tables are generated from both statistical method and rule based method. These phrase tables are later combined so that the hybrid system can exploit knowledge from both methods [30]. The advantage is that the hybrid method can gain extra knowledge from rule-based system but the errors in rule-based system can affect the correct information in statistical system [30].\nAnother method with variation in combining translation models from various sources has been proposed in 2010 by Yu Chen and Andreas Eisele [32]. In this method, instead of combining phrase tables by adding one binary feature for each individual system, all features in both translation models are retained while combining.\nBLEU score is used as a measuring score. The hybrid method showed improved performance than the baseline word alignment or rule based approach. The performance difference between the hybrid system and the SMT core improved to nearly 1.5 BLEU [32]."

Mutual information based method shows a confidence value of 99.99% [17], which is promising. Hybrid methods like N-gram and rule based approach and word alignment and rule based approach shows good performance but requires set of rules for the language.\nClustering method also shows relatively better results but the concept of clustering and\nFigure.2. Level 1 classification of methods\ntranslation templates does not have much relevance when agglutinative languages like Indian languages, Japanese, Turkish etc are considered, and may need to consider words in its root form [10]. Alignment template approach, which is a word alignment based method, does not distinguish between good or bad templates though it can be learned automatically using bilingual corpus. When N-gram based approached are considered, basic N-gram shows less accuracy as internal structure of phrases are not considered. Bilingual N-grams show good performance than basic and is less computationally expensive, but it lacks an explanatory framework. Block based method is another candidate but it can be computationally expensive. Rule based approaches is not so efficient as the task of developing a rule set for a particular language is cumbersome and also large amount of rules have to be developed manually. Thus it needs time and support from trained linguistics expert. But when compared with N-grams, the accuracy is more for rule-based\napproach as it takes into consideration the internal structure of phrases. Hybrid methods like Ngram and rule based approach and word alignment and rule based approach shows good performance but requires set of rules for the language. Syntactic method is not much efficient, as syntactic models do not provide important phrase alignments. Weighting of syntactic phrases also does not improve the performance much.\nMethod Author\nand year\nCorpus\nused\nInitial\nalignment requireme\nnt of\ncorpus\nBase approach Tools\nused Technique used\nBasic N-\ngram based\nmethod\nWilliam B.

Text classification is an important constituent in many information management tasks like topic identification, spam filtering, email routing, language identification, genre classification, readability assessment etc. The performance of text classification improves notably when phrase patterns are used. The use of phrase patterns helps in capturing non-local behaviours and thus helps in the improvement of text classification task. Phrase structure extraction is the first step to continue with the phrase pattern identification. In this survey, detailed study of phrase structure learning methods have been carried out. This will enable future work in several NLP tasks, which uses syntactic information from phrase structure like grammar checkers, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, text classification. The paper also provides different levels of classification and detailed comparison of the phrase structure learning methods.",
