      "text" : "Modeling text (words, topics and documents) is a key problem in nature language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The goal is to find short and essential descriptions which enable efficient processing of large systems and benefit basic tasks such as classification, clustering, summarization and estimation of similarity or relevance.\nDuring the past decades, various models and solutions are proposed, such as Bag-of-Words (BOW) (Harris, 1954), TF-IDF (Salton and McGill, 1983), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer et al., 1998) and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 1999). But the best-known model is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) which describes\nthe hierarchical relationships between words, topics and documents. In LDA, documents are represented as probability distributions over latent topics where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words. However, the probability distribution generated from LDA prefers to describe the statistical relationship of occurrences rather than real semantic information embedded in words, topics and documents. Also LDA will assign high probabilities to high frequency words and those words with low probabilities are hard to be chosen as representatives of topics. But in practice, low probability words sometimes distinguish topics better. For example, LDA will assign higher probability and choose “food” as representative other than “cheeseburger”, “drug” other than “aricept” and “technology” other than “smartphone”.\nRecently, distributed representations with neural probabilistic language models (NPLMs) (Bengio et al., 2003) were proposed to represent words and documents as low-dimensional vectors in one semantic space, and achieved significant results in many NLP and ML tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mnih and Hinton, 2009; Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mnih and Kavukcuoglu, 2013; Huang et al., 2012; Le and Mikolov, 2014). In particular, Word2Vec proposed by Mikolov et al. (2013a) could automatically learn concepts and semantic-syntactic relationships between words like vec(“Berlin”) - vec(“Germany”) = vec(“Paris”) - vec(“France”). Doc2Vec (Para2Vec) proposed by Le and Mikolov (2014) achieves state-of-the-art performance on sentiment analysis. Naturally, in this paper, we want to answer the question that, what will happen if we embed topics in the semantic vector space?\nFollowing the ideas of previously proposed models for words and documents, we propose the model Topic2Vec as shown in Fig. 1. Based on the Word2Vec, we incorporates topics into the NPLM framework for learning distributed representations\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n08 42\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n8 Ju\nn 20\n15\nof topics in the same semantic space with words. Furthermore, words and topics naturally can estimate similarity and relevance with each other such as using cosine function rather than using probability.\nIn the experiments, we evaluate two different topic representations including embedding of Topic2Vec and probability of LDA in two aspects: listed examples and t-SNE 2D embedding of nearest words for each topic. The experimental results show that our Topic2Vec achieves distinctive and meaningful results compared to LDA."

      "text" : "Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) is a probabilistic generative model that assumes each document is a mixture of latent topics, where each topic is a probability distribution over all words in vocabulary. Briefly, LDA generates a sequence of words as follows:\n• For each of the N word wn in document d:\n– Sample a topic zn ∼Multinomial(θd) – Sample a word wn ∼Multinomial(φzn).\nBy Gibbs Sampling 1 estimation, we obtain document-topic probability matrix Θ and topicword probability matrix Φ. For a new document of arbitrary length, we can infer its involved latent topics and meanwhile we will assign a topic label for each word in the document."

      "heading" : "3 Topic2Vec",
      "text" : "Inspired by word2vec, we incorporate topics and words into the NPLM. We propose Topic2Vec as shown in Fig. 1 for learning distributed topic representations together with word representations. Topic2Vec is also separated in CBOW and Skip-gram situations. For instance, given a word sequence (wt−2, wt−1, wt, wt+1, wt+2), in which wt is the current word assigned with topic zt by LDA. The CBOW predicts the word wt and topic zt based on the surrounding words (wt−2, wt−1, wt+1, wt+2), while the Skip-gram predicts surrounding words (wt−2, wt−1, wt+1, wt+2) given current wt and zt.\nWhen training, given a word-topic sequence of a document D = {w1 : z1, ..., wM : zM}, where zi is the word wi’s topic inferred from LDA, the learning objective functions can be defined to maximize the following log-likelihoods, based on CBOW and Skip-gram, respectively.\n(3a)LCBOW (D) = 1\nM M∑ i=1 (log p(wi|wcxt)\n+ log p(zi|wcxt)),\n(3b)\nLSkip−gram(D)\n= 1\nM M∑ i=1 ∑ −k≤c≤k,c6=0 (log p(wi+c|wi)\n+ log p(wi+c|zi)).\nTopic2Vec aims at learning topic representations along with word representations. Considering the simplicity and efficient solution, we just follow the optimization scheme that used in Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a). To approximately maximize the probability of the softmax, we use Negative Sampling without Hierarchical Softmax (Mikolov et al., 2013b). Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and back-propagation algorithm are used to optimize our model. By the way, complexity of our Topic2Vec is linear with size of dataset, same with Word2Vec."

      "text" : "Fig. 2 shows top 10 nearest words from LDA and Topic2Vec for eight typically selected topics, respectively. We now give more detailed analysis to understand the difference between them. As shown in Fig. 2, in Topic 19, LDA returns the words like “drug”, “drugs”, “cancer” and “patients”, while Topic2Vec returns “aricept”, “memantine”, “enbrel” and “gabapentin”. In Topic 27, LDA returns the words of “medical”, “hospital”, “care”, “patients” and “doctors”, while Topic2Vec returns “neonatal”, “anesthesiologists”, “anesthesia” and “comatose”. We only know that Topic 19 and Topic 27 share the same topic about “patients” or “medical”, but we can’t get their further difference from the results of LDA. But from the result of Topic2Vec, we can easily discover that Topic 19 focuses on a more specific topic about drugs (“aricept”, “memantine”, “enbrel” and “gabapentin”), while Topic 27\nfocuses on another specific topic about treatment (“anesthesiologists”, “anesthesia” and “comatose”), they are absolutely different. Obviously, Topic2Vec presents more distinguished results between two similar topics.\nFig. 3 shows the 2D embedding of the corresponding related words for each topic by using t-SNE. Obviously, Topic2Vec produces a better grouping and separation of the words in different topics. In contrast, LDA does not produce a well separated embedding, and words in different topics tend to mix together.\nIn summary, for each topic, words selected by Topic2Vec are more typical and representative compared to those returned by LDA. Eventually, Topic2Vec can better distinguish different topics."

      "text" : "In this paper, via integrating NPLM, Word2Vec and LDA, we propose the Topic2Vec which successfully embeds latent topics in the same semantic vector space with words. In principle, our purpose clearly aims at learning new fashion topic representation by Topic2Vec. From the observation of experiments, Topic2Vec presents more distinguished results than LDA and we have the conclusion that Topic2Vec can model topics better.\nBut now, we just qualitatively evaluate the performance of Topic2Vec and LDA, we will quantitatively do more detailed analysis about their difference in the future. Besides, we have to run LDA firstly to assign a topic for each word in the corpus before Topic2Vec. We also will explore new independent topic models which can mine thematic structure of documents as LDA and learn inherent representations and model topics better as\nTopic2Vec, simultaneously."

However, the probability distribution from LDA only describes the statistical relationship of occurrences in the corpus and usually in practice, probability is not the best choice for feature representations. Recently, embedding methods have been proposed to represent words and documents by learning essential concepts and representations, such as Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. The embedded representations have shown more effectiveness than LDA-style representations in many tasks. In this paper, we propose the Topic2Vec approach which can learn topic representations in the same semantic vector space with words, as an alternative to probability. The experimental results show that Topic2Vec achieves interesting and meaningful results.",
