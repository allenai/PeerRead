      "text" : "Producing true causal explanations requires deep understanding of the domain. This is beyond the capabilities of modern AI. However, it is possible to collect large amounts of causally related events, and, given powerful enough representational variability, to construct cause-effect chains by selecting individual pairs appropriately and linking them together. Our hypothesis is that chains composed\nof locally coherent pairs can suggest overall causation.\nIn this paper, we view causality as (commonsense) cause-effect expressions that occur frequently in online text such as news articles or tweets. For example, “greenhouse gases causes global warming” is a sentence that provides an ‘atomic’ link that can be used in a larger chain. By connecting such causal facts in a sequence, the result can be regarded as a causal explanation between the two ends of the sequence (see Table 1 for examples). This paper makes the following contributions: • we define the problem of causal explanation\ngeneration, • we detect causal features of a time series event\n(CSPIKES) using Granger (Granger, 1988) method with features extracted from text such as N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition, • we produce a large graph called CGRAPH of lo-\ncal cause-effect units derived from text and develop a method to produce causal explanations by selecting and linking appropriate units, using neural representations to enable unit matching and chaining.\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n08 85\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n7 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nTable 1: Examples of generated causal explanation between some temporal causes and target companies’ stock prices.\nparty cut7−−→ budget cuts lower7−−−−→ budget bill decreas7−−−−−→ republicans caus7−−−→ obama leadto7−−−−→ facebook polls caus7−−−→ facebook’s stock ↓\nThe problem of causal explanation generation arises for systems that seek to determine causal factors for events of interest automatically. For given time series events such as companies’ stock market prices, our system called CSPIKES detects events that are deemed causally related by time series analysis using Granger Causality regression (Granger, 1988). We consider a large amount of text and tweets related to each company, and produces for each company time series of values for hundreds of thousands of word n-grams, topic labels, sentiment values, etc. Figure 1 shows an example of causal features that temporally causes Facebook’s stock rise in August.\nHowever, it is difficult to understand how the statistically verified factors actually cause the changes, and whether there is a latent causal structure relating the two. This paper addresses the challenge of finding such latent causal structures, in the form of causal explanations that connect the given cause-effect pair. Table 1 shows example causal explanation that our system found between party and Facebook’s stock fall (↓).\nTo construct a general causal graph, we extract all potential causal expressions from a large corpus of text. We refer to this graph as CGRAPH. We use FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) semantics to provide various causative expressions (verbs, relations, and patterns), which we apply to a resource of 183, 253, 995 sentences of text and tweets. These expressions are considerably richer than previous rule-based patterns (Riaz and Girju, 2013; Kozareva, 2012). CGRAPH contains 5,025,636 causal edges.\nOur experiment demonstrates that our causality detection algorithm outperforms other baseline methods for forecasting future time series values. Also, we tested the neural reasoner on the inference generation task using the BLEU score. Additionally, our human evaluation shows the relative effectiveness of neural reasoners in generating appropriate lexicons in explanations."

Granger showed that given a target time series y (effect) and a source time series x (cause), forecasting future target value yt with both past target and past source time series E(yt|y<t, x<t) is significantly powerful than with only past target time seriesE(yt|y<t) (plain auto-regression), if x and y are indeed a cause-effect pair. First, we learn the parameters α and β to maximize the prediction expectation:\nE(yt|y<t, xt−l) = m∑ j=1 αjyt−j + n∑ i=1 βixt−i (2)\nwhere i and j are size of lags in the past observation.

      "text" : "Extracting meaningful features is a key component to detect causality. For example, to predict future trend of presidential election poll of Donald Trump, we need to consider his past poll data as well as people’s reaction about his pledges such\nas Immigration, Syria etc. To extract such “good” features crawled from on-line media data, we propose three different types of features: Fwords, Ftopic, and Fsenti. Fwords is time series of N-gram words that reflect popularity of the word over time in on-line media. For each word, the number of items (e.g., tweets, blogs and news) that contains the N-gram word is counted to get the day-by-day time series. For example, xMichael Jordan = [12, 51, ..] is a time series for a bi-gram word Michael Jordan. We filter out stationary words by using simple measures to estimate how dynamically the time series of each word changes over time. Some of the simple measures include Shannon entropy, mean, standard deviation, maximum slope, and number of rise and fall peaks. Ftopic is time series of latent topics with respect to the target time series. The latent topic is a group of semantically similar words as identified by a standard topic clustering method such as LDA (Blei et al., 2003). To obtain temporal trend of the latent topics, we choose the top ten frequent words in each topic and count their occurrence in the text to get the day-by-day time series. For example, xhealthcare means how popular the topic healthcare that consists of insurance, obamacare etc, is through time. Fsenti is time series of sentiments (positive or negative) for each topic. The top ten frequent words in each topic are used as the keywords, and tweets, blogs and news that contain at least one of these keywords are chosen to calculate the sentiment score. The day-by-day sentiment series are then obtained by counting positive and negative words using OpinionFinder (Wilson et al., 2005), and normalized by the total number of the items that day."

The causality function C uses Granger causality (Granger, 1988) by fitting the two time series with a Vector AutoRegressive model with exogenous variables (VARX) (Hamilton, 1994): yt = αyt−l + βxt−l + t where t is a white Gaussian random vector at time t and l is a lag term. In our problem, the number of source time series x is not single so the prediction happens in the k multi-variate features X =\n(f1, ...fk) so:\nyt = αyt−l + β(f1,t−l + ...+ fk,t−l) + t (3)\nwhere α and β is the coefficient matrix of the target y and source X time series respectively, and is a residual (prediction error) for each time series. β means contributions of each lagged feature fk,t−l to the predicted value yt. If the variance of βk is reduced by the inclusion of the feature terms fk,t−l ∈ X , then it is said that fk,t−l Grangercauses y.\nOur causality function C is then C(y, f, l) = ∆(βy,f,l) where ∆ is change of variance by the feature f with lag l. The total Granger causality of target y is computed by summing the change of variance over all lags and all features:\nC(y,X) = ∑ k,l C(y, fk, l) (4)\nWe compose best set of features Φ by choosing top k features with highest causality scores for each target y. In practice, due to large amount of computation for pairwise Granger calculation, we make a bipartite graph between features and targets, and address two practical problems: noisiness and hidden edges. We filter out noisy edges based on TFIDF and fill out missing values using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Hoyer, 2004)."

(et 7→ y), then e1 7→ e2, ... 7→ et might be a good causal explanation between x and y. Section 3 and 4 describe how to bridge the causal gap between given events (x, y) by (1) constructing a large general cause-effect graph (CGRAPH) from text, (2) linking the given events to their equivalent entities in the causal graph by finding the internal paths (x 7→ e1, ...et 7→ y) as causal explanations, using neural algorithms.\nCGRAPH is a knowledge base graph where edges are directed and causally related between entities. To address less representational variability of rule based methods (Girju, 2003; Blanco et al., 2008; Sharp et al., 2016) in the causal graph construction, we used FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) semantics. Using a semantic parser such\nas SEMAFOR (Chen et al., 2010) that produces a FrameNet style analysis of semantic predicateargument structures, we could obtain lexical tuples of causation in the sentence. Since our goal is to collect only causal relations, we extract total 36 causation related frames1 from the parsed sentences.\nTo generate meaningful explanations, high coverage of the knowledge is necessary. We collect six years of tweets and NYT news articles from 1989 to 2007 (See Experiment section for details). In total, our corpus has 1.5 billion tweets and 11 million sentences from news articles. The Table 3 has the number of sentences processed and number of entities, relations, and tuples in the final CGRAPH.\nSince the tuples extracted from text are very noisy 2, we constructed a large causal graph by linking the tuples with string match and filter out the noisy nodes and edges based on some graph statistics. We filter out nodes with very high degree that are mostly stop-words or auto-generated sentences. Too long or short sentences are also filtered out. Table 2 shows the (case, relation, effect) tuples with manually annotated categories such as General, Company, Country, and People.\n1Causation, Cause change, Causation scenario, Cause benefit or detriment, Cause bodily experience, etc.\n2SEMAFOR has around 62% of accuracy on held-out set."

However, the graph searching procedure is likely to be incomplete (low recall), because simple string match is insufficient to match an effect to all its related entities, as it misses out in the case where an entity is semantically related but has a lexically different name.\nTo address the low recall problem and generate better explanations, we propose the use of knowledge base to augment our text-based causal graph with real-world semantic knowledge. We use Freebase (Google, 2016) as the external knowledge base for this purpose. Among 1.9 billion edges in original Freebase dump, we collect its first and second hop neighbours for each target events.\nWhile our CGRAPH is lexical in nature, Freebase entities appear as identifiers (MIDs). For entity linking between two knowledge graphs, we need to annotate Freebase entities with their lexical names by looking at the wiki URLs. We refer to the edges with freebase expansion as KB-KB edges, and link the KB-KB with our CGRAPH us-\ning lexical matching, referring as KBcross edges (See Table 3 for the number of the edges)."

To address the lexical sparseness, we propose a lexically relaxed reasoning using a neural network.\nInspired by recent success on alignment task such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), our model learns the causal alignment between cause phrase and effect phrase for each type of relation between them. Rather than traversing the CGRAPH, our neural reasoner uses CGRAPH as a training resource. The encoder, a recurrent neural network such as LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), takes the causal phrase while the decoder, another LSTM, takes the effectual phrase with their relation specific attention.\nIn original attention model (Bahdanau et al., 2014), the contextual vector c is computed by ci = aij∗hj where hj is hidden state of causal sequence at time j and aij is soft attention weight, trained by feed forward network aij = FF (hj , si−1) between input hidden state hj and output hidden state si−1. The global attention matrix a, however, is easy to mix up all local alignment patterns of each relation.\nFor example, a tuple, (north korea (Agent) developing7−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→\n(Cause to make progress) nuclear weapons (Project)),\nis different with another tuple, (chrome (Item) promotes7−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→\n(Cause change of position) google (Agent)) in terms of\nlocal type of causality. To deal with the local attention, we decomposed the attention weight aij by relation specific transformation in feed forward network:\naij = FF (hj , si−1, r)\nwhere FF has relation specific hidden layer and r ∈ R is a type of relation in the distinct set of relations R in training corpus (See Figure 2).\nSince training only with our causal graph may not be rich enough for dealing various lexical variation in text, we use pre-trained word embedding such as word2vec (Mikolov and Dean, 2013) trained on GoogleNews corpus3 for initialization. For example, given a cause phrase weapon equipped, our model could generate multiple effect phrases with their likelihood: ( result7−−−→\n0.54 war),\n( force7−−−→ 0.12 army reorganized), etc, even though there are no tuples exactly matched in CGRAPH.\n3https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\nWe trained our neural reasoner in either forward or backward direction. In prediction, decoder inferences by predicting effect (or cause) phrase in forward (or backward) direction. As described in the Algorithm 1, the backward inference continue predicting the previous causal phrases until it has high enough Granger confidence with the target event."

(Hlaváčková-Schindler et al., 2007) studies more theoretical investigation for measuring causal influence in multivariate time series based on the entropy and mutual information estimation. However, none of them attempts generating explanation on the temporal causality.\nPrevious works on text causality detection use syntactic patterns such as X verb7−−→ Y , where the verb is causative (Girju, 2003; Riaz and Girju, 2013; Kozareva, 2012; Do et al., 2011) with additional features (Blanco et al., 2008). (Kozareva, 2012) extracted cause-effect relations, where the pattern for bootstrapping has a form of X∗ verb7−−→\nZ∗\nY from which terms X∗ and Z∗ was learned. The syntax based approaches, however, are not robust to semantic variation.\nAs a part of SemEval (Girju et al., 2007), (Mirza and Tonelli, 2016) also uses syntactic causative patterns (Mirza and Tonelli, 2014) and supervised classifier to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Extracting the cause-effect tuples with such syntactic features or temporality (Bethard et al., 2008) would be our next step for better causal graph construction.\n(Grivaz, 2010) conducts very insightful annotation study of what features are used in human reasoning on causation. Beyond the linguistic tests and causal chains for explaining causality in our work, other features such as counterfactuality, temporal order, and ontological asymmetry remain as our future direction to study.\nTextual entailment also seeks a directional relation between two given text fragments (Dagan et al., 2006). Recently, (Rocktäschel et al., 2015) developed an attention-based neural network method, trained on large annotated pairs of textual entailment, for classifying the types of relations with decomposable attention (Parikh et al., 2016) or sequential tree structure (Chen et al., 2016). However, the dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) used for training entailment deals with just three categories, contradiction, neutral, and entailment, and focuses on relatively simple lexical and syntactic transformations (Kolesnyk et al., 2016). Our causal explanation generation task is also similar to future scenario generation (Hashimoto et al., 2014, 2015). Their scoring\nfunction uses heuristic filters and is not robust to lexical variation."

We define a novel problem of generating explanations of a time series event by (1) searching cause and effect relationships of the time series with textual data and (2) constructing a connecting chain between them to generate an explanation. To detect causal features from text, we propose a novel method based on the Granger causality of time series between features extracted from text such as N-grams, topics, sentiments, and their composition. The generation of the sequence of causal entities requires a commonsense causative knowledge base with efficient reasoning. To ensure good interpretability and appropriate lexical usage we combine symbolic and neural representations, using a neural reasoning algorithm trained on commonsense causal tuples to predict the next cause step.
