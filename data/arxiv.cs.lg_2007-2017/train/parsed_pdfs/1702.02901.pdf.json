INTRODUCTION\nBrain computer interfaces (BCIs) [18], [28], [32], [45], [53] have attracted rapidly increasing research interest in the last decade, thanks to recent advances in neurosciences, wearable/mobile biosensors, and analytics. However, there are still many challenges in their transition from laboratory settings to real-life applications, including the reliability and convenience of the sensing hardware [21], and the availability of highperformance and robust algorithms for signal analysis and interpretation that can effectively handle individual differences and non-stationarity [12], [25], [28], [50]. This paper focuses on the last challenge, more specifically, how to generalize a BCI algorithm to a new subject, with zero or very little subjectspecific calibration data.\nTransfer learning (TL) [34], which improves learning in a new task by leveraging data or knowledge from other relevant tasks, represents a promising solution to the above challenge. Many TL approaches have been proposed for BCI applications [50], including: 1) feature representation transfer [7], [13], [39], [41], which encodes the knowledge across different tasks as features; 2) instance transfer [19], [20], [56], [63], which uses certain parts of the data from other tasks to help the learning for the current task; and, 3) classifier transfer, which includes domain adaptation (DA) [1], [41], [47], ensemble learning [42], [43], and their combinations [54], [60], [61].\nHowever, most of the above TL approaches consider only BCI classification problems. Reducing the calibration data requirement in BCI regression problems has been largely understudied. One example is online driver drowsiness estimation from EEG signals, which will be investigated in this paper. This is a very important problem because drowsy driving is among the most important causes of road crashes, following only to alcohol, speeding, and inattention [38]. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [44], 2.5% of fatal motor vehicle crashes (on average 886/year in the U.S.) and 2.5% of fatalities (on average 1,004/year in the U.S.) between 2005 and 2009 involved drowsy driving. However, to our best knowledge, there have been only two works [51], [54] on TL for drowsiness estimation. Wei et al. [51] showed that selective TL, which selectively turns TL on or off based the level of session generalizability, can achieve better estimation performance than approaches that always turn TL on or off. Wu et al. [54] proposed a domain adaptation with model fusion (DAMF) approach for drowsiness estimation. By making use of data from other subjects in a DA framework, DAMF requires very little subject-specific calibration data, which significantly increases its real-world applicability.\nIn this paper, by making use of fuzzy sets (FSs) [67], we extend our earlier work on online weighted adaptation\n2 regularization [60] from classification to regression to estimate driver drowsiness online from EEG signals. We show that our two proposed algorithms can achieve significantly better estimation performance than the DAMF and two other baseline approaches.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the details of the proposed online weighted adaptation regularization for regression (OwARR) algorithm. Section III further introduces a source domain selection (SDS) approach to save the computational cost of OwARR. Section IV presents experimental results and performance comparisons of OwARR and OwARR-SDS with three other approaches. Finally, Section V draws conclusions and points out future research directions."

      "text" : "In [60] we have defined two types of calibration in BCI: 1) Offline calibration, in which a pool of unlabeled EEG\nepochs have been obtained a priori, and a subject or an oracle is queried to label some of these epochs, which are then used to train a model to label the remaining epochs in the pool. 2) Online calibration, in which some labeled EEG epochs are obtained on-the-fly, and then a model is trained from them for future (unseen) EEG epochs.\nThe major different between them is that, for offline calibration, the unlabeled EEG epochs can be used to help design the model (e.g., semi-supervised learning), whereas in online calibration there are no unlabeled EEG epochs. Additionally, in offline calibration we can query any epoch in the pool for the label, but in online calibration usually the sequence of the epochs is pre-determined and the subject or oracle has little control on which epochs to see next.\nWe only consider online calibration in this paper. This section introduces the OwARR algorithm, which extends the online weighted adaptation regularization algorithm [60] from classification to regression, by making use of FSs."

Two domains Dz and Dt are different if X z 6= X t, and/or P z(x) 6= P t(x).\nA task [23], [34] T in TL consists of an output space Y and a conditional probability distribution Q(y|x). Two tasks T z and T t are different if Yz 6= Yt, or Qz(y|x) 6= Qt(y|x).\nGiven the zth source domain Dz with nz samples (xzi , yzi ), i = 1, ..., nz, and a target domain Dt with m calibration samples (xtj , y t j), j = 1, ...,m, DA aims to learn a target prediction function f(x) : x 7→ y with low expected error on Dt, under the assumptions that X z = X t, Yz = Yt, P z(x) 6= P t(x), and Qz(y|x) 6= Qt(y|x).\nIn driver drowsiness estimation from EEG signals, EEG signals from a new subject are in the target domain, while EEG signals from the zth existing subject are in the zth source domain. A single data sample consists of the feature vector for\na single EEG epoch in either domain. Though the features in source and target domains are extracted in the same way, generally their marginal and conditional probability distributions are different, i.e., P z(x) 6= P t(x) and Qz(y|x) 6= Qt(y|x), because different subjects usually have similar but distinct drowsy neural responses. As a result, data from a source domain cannot represent data in the target domain accurately, and must be integrated with some target domain data to induce the target domain regression function."

Then, the regression function can be written as\nf(x) = αTx (2)\nwhere α is the regression parameter vector to be found. The learning framework of OwARR is then formulated as:\nf =argmin f\nn ∑\ni=1\n(yi − f(xi))2 + wt n+m ∑\ni=n+1\n(yi − f(xi))2\n+ λ[d(P z , P t) + d(Qz, Qt)]− γr̃2(y, f(x)) (3) where λ and γ are non-negative regularization parameters, and wt is the overall weight for target domain samples, which should be larger than 1 so that more emphasis is given to target domain samples than source domain samples.\nBriefly speaking, the first two terms in (3) minimize the sum of squared errors in the source domain and target domain, respectively. The 3rd term minimizes the distance between the marginal and conditional probability distributions in the two domains. The last term maximizes the approximate sample Pearson correlation coefficient between y and f(x), which helps avoid the undesirable situation that the regression output is (nearly) a constant.\nIn the next subsections we will explain how to compute the individual terms in (3)."

First, for the nz outputs, {yzi }i=1,...,n, in the zth source domain, we find their 5, 50 and 95 percentile2 values, pz5, p z 50 and p z 95, respectively, and define three triangular FSs3, Smallz, Mediumz and Largez, based on them, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In this way, we can “classify” the outputs in the zth source domain into three fuzzy classes, Smallz, Mediumz and Largez, corresponding to the different classes in a traditional crisp classification problem. However, note that in the traditional crisp classification problem a sample can only belong to one class. For the fuzzy classes here, a sample can belong to more than one class simultaneously, at different degrees.\nDenote Class Smallz as Class 1, Class Mediumz as Class 2, Class Largez as Class 3, and the membership degree of yzi in Class c as µzic. We then normalize each µ z ic according to its class, i.e.,\nµ̄zic = µzic ∑n\ni=1 µ z ic\n, i = 1, ..., n; c = 1, 2, 3 (12)\nSimilarly, we also find pt5, p t 50 and p t 95 from the m target domain outputs {yti}i=n+1,...,n+m, define three FSs, Smallt, 2There is a popular regression analysis method called quantile regression [17] in statistics and econometrics, which estimates either the conditional median or other quantiles of the response variable. The percentiles used in this paper are found directly from the data, and they should not be confused with quantile regression.\n3There can be other ways to define these FSs, e.g., we could use Gaussian FSs instead of triangular FSs, use pz\n10 , pz 50 and pz 90 instead of pz 5 , pz 50 and\npz 95 , use other than three FSs in each domain, or use type-2 FSs [30] instead of type-1. Three type-1 triangular FSs are used here for simplicity. More discussions on the sensitivity of the OwARR algorithm to the number of type-1 triangular FSs are given in Section IV-H.\n4 Mediumt and Larget, as shown in Fig. 1(b), and compute the corresponding normalized µ̄tic, i = n+1, ..., n+m, c = 1, 2, 3.\nFinally, similar to (11), the distance between the conditional probability distributions in the target domain and the zth source domain is computed as:\nd(Qz, Qt) =\n3 ∑\nc=1\n\n\n∑\nxi∈D z\nµ̄zicf(xi)− ∑\nxi∈Dt\nµ̄ticf(xi)\n\n\n2\n(13)\nSubstituting (2) into (13), it follows that\nd(Qz, Qt) =\n3 ∑\nc=1\n\n\n∑\nxi∈D z\nµ̄zicα T xi −\n∑\nxi∈D t\nµ̄ticα T xi\n\n\n2\n= 3 ∑\nc=1\nα TXMcXα = α TXMQXα (14)\nwhere\nMQ = M1 +M2 +M3 (15)\nin which M1, M2 and M3 are MMD matrices computed as:\n(Mc)ij =\n\n    \n   \nµ̄zicµ̄ z jc, xi, xj ∈ Dzc µ̄ticµ̄ t jc, xi, xj ∈ Dtc −µ̄zicµ̄tjc, xi ∈ Dzc , xj ∈ Dtc −µ̄ticµ̄zjc, xi ∈ Dtc, xj ∈ Dzc 0, otherwise\n(16)"

Each participant read and signed an informed consent form before the experiment began. Each experiment lasted for about 60-90 minutes and was conducted in the afternoon when the circadian rhythm of sleepiness reached its peak. To induce drowsiness during driving, the virtual-reality scenes simulated monotonous driving at a fixed 100 km/h speed on a straight and empty highway. During the experiment, lane-departure events were randomly applied every 5-10 seconds, and participants were instructed to steer the vehicle to compensate for these perturbations as quickly as possible. Subjects’ cognitive states and driving performance were monitored via a surveillance video camera and the vehicle trajectory throughout the experiment. The response time in response to the perturbation was recorded and later converted to drowsiness index. Meanwhile, participants’ scalp EEG signals were recorded using a 32-channel (30-channel EEGs plus 2-channel earlobes) 500 Hz Neuroscan NuAmps Express system (Compumedics Ltd., VIC, Australia).\nThe Institutional Review Board of the Taipei Veterans General Hospital approved the experimental protocol."

That is, BL2 ignores data from existing subjects completely. 3) DAMF, which builds 14 ridge regression models by combining data from each auxiliary subject with data from the new subject, respectively, and then uses a weighted average to obtain the final regression model. The weights are also the inverse of the training RMSEs, as in Algorithms 1 and 2.\nThe ridge parameter σ = 0.01 was used in the above three algorithms, as in [54]. For OwARR and OwARR-SDS, we used σ = 0.2, λ = 10, and γ = 0.5. However, as will be shown in Section IV-H, OwARR and OwARR-SDS are robust to these three parameters."

This suggests that DA is indeed beneficial. Moreover, our proposed OwARR and OwARR-SDS achieved the best overall performances among the five algorithms.\nWe also performed two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for each m to check if the RMSE differences among the five algorithms were statistically significant, by setting the subjects as a random effect. Two-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences among them (p < 0.01) for all m. Then, non-parametric multiple comparison tests using Dunn’s procedure [8], [9] were used to determine if the difference between any pair of algorithms was statistically significant, with a p-value correction using the False Discovery Rate method [2]. The p-values are shown in Table I, where the statistically significant ones are marked in bold. Observe that the differences between OwARR and the other three algorithms (BL1, BL2, and DAMF) were always statistically significant when m > 0, so were the differences between OwARR-SDS and the two baseline algorithms. The difference between OwARR-SDS and DAMF was statistically significant\n9 for m ∈ [5, 75]. There was no statistically significant difference between OwARR and OwARR-SDS.\nFinally, we can conclude that given the same amount of subject-specific calibration data, OwARR and OwARRSDS can achieve significantly better estimation performance than the other three approaches. Or, in other words, given a desired RMSE, OwARR and OwARR-SDS require significantly less subject-specific calibration data than the other three approaches. For example, in Fig. 4(a), the average RMSE for BL2 when m = 100 was 0.2988, whereas OwARR and OwARR-SDS can achieve even smaller RMSEs without using any subject-specific calibration samples. The average RMSEs for OwARR and OwARR-SDS when m = 5 were 0.2347 and 0.2348, respectively, whereas DAMF needed at least 45 subject-specific samples to achieve these RMSEs, and BL2 needed at least 100 samples."

      "heading" : "F. Computational Cost",
      "text" : "In this subsection we compare the computational cost of the five algorithms, particularly, OwARR and OwARR-SDS, because the primary goal of SDS is to down-select the number of auxiliary subjects and hence to reduce the computational cost of OwARR.\nFig. 6 shows the average number of similar subjects selected by SDS for the 15 subjects. Observe that most of the time fewer than seven subjects (half of the number of auxiliary subjects) were selected.\nTo quantify the computational cost of the five algorithms, we show in Fig. 7 the training times for different m, averaged over 10 runs and across the 15 subjects. The platform was a Dell XPS 13 notebook, with Intel Core i7-5500M CPU@2.40GHz, 8GB memory, and 256GB solid state drive. The software was Matlab R2015b running in 64-bit Windows 10 Pro. Each algorithm was optimized to the best ability of the authors. Observe that the training time of BL1, BL2, and DAMF was almost constant, whereas the training time of OwARR increased monotonically as m increased. Interestingly, the training time of OwARR-SDS decreased slightly as m increased, because Fig. 6 shows that generally the average number of similar subjects selected by SDS decreased as m increased.\nThe computational costs of OwARR and OwARR-SDS were much higher than DAMF, because they used more sophisticated DA approaches. However, except for m = 0, at which point OwARR and OwARR-SDS had identical training time, the training time of OwARR-SDS was on average only about 49% of OwARR. This 51% computation time saving is very worthwhile when the number of source domains is very large and hence computing OwARR for all the source domains is too slow.\n0 20 40 60 80 100\nm, number of subject-specific samples\n0\n0.5\n1 C o m p u ta ti o n ti m e (s )\nBL1 BL2 DAMF OwARR OwARR-SDS\nFig. 7.

Scalability of OwARR with respect to (a) the number of source domains (each domain had about 1,200 samples); (b) the number of samples in each source domain (14 source domains were used).\nWe also investigated the scalability of OwARR with respect to Z , the number of source domains, and n, the number of samples in each source domain. Because we only had 14 source domains in this dataset, we bootstrapped them to create additional domains when Z ≥ 14. The results are shown in Fig. 8. Observe from Fig. 8(a) that the computational cost of OwARR increased linearly with the number of source domains, which is intuitive, because OwARR performs DA for each source domain separately and then aggregates the results. However, Fig. 8(b) shows that the computational cost of OwARR increased superlinearly with the number of samples in the source domains. Least-squares curve fitting found that the computation time was about 0.0000021 · n1.8 + 0.035 seconds, i.e., the computational cost is O(n1.8) for 14 source domains.\nFinally, it is important to note that the above analyses are only for the training of the algorithms. Once the training is done, the resulting OwARR and OwARR-SDS models can be executed much faster."

      "heading" : "G. Robustness to Noises",
      "text" : "It is also important to study the robustness of the five algorithms to noises. According to [68], there are two types of noises: class noise, which is the noise on the model outputs, and attribute noise, which is the noise on the model inputs. In this subsection we focus on the attribute noise.\nAs in [68], for each model input, we randomly replaced q% (q = 0, 10, ..., 50) of all epochs from the new subject with a uniform noise between its minimum and maximum values. After this was done for both the training and testing data, we trained the five algorithms on the corrupted training data and then tested their performances on the corrupted testing data. The RMSEs for three different m (the number of labeled subject-specific samples), averaged across 15 subjects\n10\nwith five runs per subject, are shown in Fig. 9. Observe that as the noise level q increased, generally all algorithms had worse RMSEs. OwARR and OwARR-SDS still had the smallest RMSEs among the five when q was small. However, when q increased, DAMF became the best. This suggests that OwARR and OwARR-SDS may not be as robust as DAMF with respect to attribute noises, but when the noise level is low, the performance improvement achieved from the sophisticated optimizations in OwARR and OwARR-SDS dominates, and hence they are still the best algorithms among the five. When the noise level is high, we may need some noise handling approaches, e.g., noise correction [68], before applying OwARR and OwARR-SDS."

      "heading" : "H. Parameter Sensitivity Analysis",
      "text" : "The OwARR algorithm has three adjustable parameters: σ, which determines the weight wt for the target domain samples; λ, which is a regularization parameter minimizing the distances between the marginal and conditional probability\ndistributions in the source and target domains; and γ, which maximizes the approximate Pearson correlation coefficient between the true and estimated outputs. It is interesting to study whether all of them are necessary.\nFor this purpose, we constructed three modified versions of the OwARR algorithms by setting σ, λ and γ to zero, respectively, and compared their average RMSEs with that of the original OwARR. The results are shown in Fig. 10. Observe that the original OwARR had better performance than all three modified versions, suggesting that all three parameters in OwARR contributed to its superior performance.\nNext we studied the sensitivity of OwARR to the three adjustable parameters, σ, λ and γ. The results are shown in Fig. 11(a)-(c). Observe that OwARR is robust to σ in the range of [0.1, 0.4], to λ in the range of [1, 20], and to γ in the range of [0.01, 1].\nAdditionally, three type-1 triangular FSs have been used in conditional probability distribution adaptation (Section II-E) in this paper for simplicity. It is also interesting to study the sensitivity of the OwARR algorithm to the number of FSs. The results are shown in Fig. 11(d). Observe that OwARR gives the optimal performance when the number of FSs is between 2 and 5, but its performance gradually deteriorates when the number of FSs further increases. This is intuitive, because the target domain has a limited number of labeled training samples, so as the number of FSs increases, the number of target domain\n11\nsamples that fall into each fuzzy class decreases, and hence the computed fuzzy class means are less reliable. As a result, the distance between the conditional probability distributions [see (14)] cannot be reliably computed.\nAnother interesting questions is: what would be the performance of OwARR if no FSs are used at all, i.e., conditional probability distribution adaptation is disabled? This is corresponding to the left-most slice in Fig. 11(d), where the number of FSs is zero. Observe that this results in worse RMSEs than the case that two to five FSs are used in conditional probability distribution adaptation, suggesting the FS approach is beneficial."

In this subsection we study whether this fusion strategy is effective. The performances of the 14 base DA models and the final aggregation model for a typical subject are shown in Fig. 12. Observe that the aggregated model is better than most base DA models, and is also close to the best base DA model (which is unknown in practice), suggesting that the fusion strategy is effective. However, it may be possible that a better fusion strategy can make the final model outperform all base DA models. This will be one of our future research directions."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH",
      "text" : "Transfer learning, which improves learning performance in a new task by leveraging data or knowledge from other relevant tasks, represents a promising solution for handling individual differences in BCI. Previously we have proposed a weighted\nadaptation regularization (wAR) algorithm [59], [61] for offline BCI classification problems, an online weighted adaptation regularization (OwAR) algorithm [60] for online BCI classification problems, and a SDS approach [60], [61] to reduce the computational cost of wAR and OwAR. In this paper we have proposed an OwARR algorithm to extend the OwAR algorithm from classification to regression, and validated its performance on online estimation of driver drowsiness from EEG signals. Meanwhile, we have also extended the SDS algorithm for classification in [60] to regression problems, and verified that OwARR-SDS can achieve similar performance to OwARR, but save about half of the computation time. Both OwARR and OwARR-SDS use fuzzy sets to perform part of the adaptation regularization, and OwARR-SDS also uses fuzzy sets to select the closest source domains.\nThough OwARR and OwARR-SDS have demonstrated outstanding performance, they can be enhanced in a number of ways, which will be considered in our future research. First, Fig. 5(a) shows that OwARR and OwARR-SDS had worse RMSEs than BL1 for some subjects. This indicates that they still have room for improvement: we could develop a mechanism to switch between BL1 and OwARR (OwARRSDS) so that a more appropriate method is chosen according to the characteristics of the new subject, similar to the idea of selective TL [51]. Second, we will extend OwARR and OwARRSDS to offline calibration, where the goal is to automatically label some initially unlabeled subject-specific samples with a small number of queries [61]. Semi-supervised learning can be used here to enhance the learning performance. Third, in this paper we combine the base learners using a simple weighted average, where the weights of the base learners are inversely proportional to their corresponding training RMSEs. This may not be optimal because what really matter here are the testing RMSEs. In online calibration it is not easy to estimate the testing RMSEs because we do not know what samples will be encountered in the future; however, in offline calibration we can better estimate the testing performances of the base learners using a spectral meta-learner approach [58], and hence a better model fusion strategy could be developed. Fourth, similar to offline classification problems [29], [55], [59], in offline regression problems we can also integrate DA with active learning [40], [57] to further reduce the offline calibration effort. Finally, we will apply the online and offline DA algorithms to other regression problems in BCI and beyond to cope with individual differences, e.g., estimating the continuous values of arousal, valence and dominance from\n12\nspeech signals [64] in affective computing."

This work was also partially supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) under discovery grant DP150101645.\nAPPENDIX FUZZY SETS (FSS)\nFS theory was first introduced by Zadeh [67] in 1965 and has been successfully used in many areas, including modeling and control [49], [65], data mining [35], [62], [66], time-series prediction [14], [46], decision making [30], [31], [37], etc.\nA FS X is comprised of a universe of discourse DX of real numbers together with a membership function (MF) µ\nX :\nDX → [0, 1], i.e.,\nX =\n∫\nDX\nµ X (x)/x (24)\nHere ∫ denotes the collection of all points x ∈ DX with associated membership degree µ\nX (x). An example of a FS is\nshown in Fig. 13. The membership degrees are µX(1) = 0, µX(3) = 0.5, µX(5) = 1, µX(6) = 0.8, and µX(10) = 0. Observe that this is different from traditional (binary) sets, where each element can only belong to a set completely (i.e., with membership degree 1), or does not belong to it at all (i.e., with membership degree 0); there is nothing in between (i.e., with membership degree 0.5).\nFSs are frequently used in modeling concepts in natural language, which may not have clear boundary. For example, we may define a hot day as temperature equal to or above 30◦C, but is 29◦C hot? If we represent hot as a binary set {x|x ≥ 30}, then 29◦C is not hot, because it does not belong to the binary set hot. However, this does not completely agree with people’s intuition: 29◦C is very close to 30◦C, and hence it is somewhat hot. If we represent hot as a FS, we may say 29◦C is hot with a membership degree of 0.9, which sounds more reasonable."

Transfer learning and domain adaptation have been extensively used for this purpose. However, most previous works focused on classification problems. This paper considers an important regression problem in BCI, namely, online driver drowsiness estimation from EEG signals. By integrating fuzzy sets with domain adaptation, we propose a novel online weighted adaptation regularization for regression (OwARR) algorithm to reduce the amount of subject-specific calibration data, and also a source domain selection (SDS) approach to save about half of the computational cost of OwARR. Using a simulated driving dataset with 15 subjects, we show that OwARR and OwARR-SDS can achieve significantly smaller estimation errors than several other approaches. We also provide comprehensive analyses on the robustness of OwARR and OwARR-SDS.",
