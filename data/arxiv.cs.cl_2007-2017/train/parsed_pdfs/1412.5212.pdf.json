      "text" : "This a draft version of the paper published in “Legal Knowledge an Information Systems,\nJURIX 2014: The Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference”, Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and\nApplications, Volume 271, edited by Rinke Hoekstra, IOSPress, 2014. The final publication is\navailable from IOSPress.\nTopic modelling algorithms are statistical methods capable of detecting common themes present in the analyzed text corpora. In this work, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used [1]. It operates on documents in the bag-of-words representation and returns a set of detected topics (i.e., groups of words and their probabilities reflecting the importance in particular topic). In addition, the topic proportions for each document can be determined. In this paper, I demonstrate the utility of the LDA method for analyzing judgments from public procurement field. In addition, I propose combining LDA with a keyphrase extraction scheme, as it improves topics interpretability and computational performance.\nFor this study, a corpus of 13 thousand judgments of the National Appeal Chamber was used. National Appeal Chamber is competent for the examination of the appeals lodged in the contract award procedures in Poland. The judgments covered the period between 12.2007 and 05.2014. For LDA, the Gibbs sampling method implemented in the MALLET package (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/) was applied. After preliminary tests, the number of topics was adjusted to 20. Lower values yield many overly broad topics, and higher values increased granularity and provided many topics without a clear interpretation.\nSample themes detected by the LDA method within the analyzed corpus of judgments are presented in Figure 1. Initially, the LDA procedure was performed on the bag-of-words representation. The obtained themes looked promising. E.g.,\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n52 12\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 6\nD ec\n2 01\n4\ntopic W1 is clearly related to the municipal waste management, W2 deals with construction works. Nevertheless, many topics seemed difficult to interpret, such as, e.g., topic W3. Therefore, the LDA algorithm was ran also on the reduced representation of documents consisting of auto-detected keyphrases, which were extracted using unsupervised approach (see [2] and references therein). To a large extent, it was possible to match the topics generated from plain words with the keyphrase case (compare K1 and W1 both related to waste management or K2 and W2 which deal with construction works). However, the keyphrase method detected larger number of clearly interpretable topics. See, e.g., K3 related to telecommunication services, which was not present among the plain word topics. Another practical advantage is that the keyword method is more computationally efficient, because of the more compact document representation. Full run on the precalculated keyword representation took 12 minutes, whereas similar analysis on words lasted over 2 hours on the same 4 CPU cores.\nAnother interesting output of the LDA method is a percentage of every topic in each document. This enables for analysis of the time trends occurring in themes of appeals lodged in contract award procedures. As an example of such analysis, I extracted temporal behaviour for topics K1 (waste management) and K2 (construction works), see Figure 2. The K1 theme has a very clear peak in 2013. This\nis definitely related to a significant change of regulations in Poland, which forced all municipalities to select new waste management company within tendering procedure in this period. The time trend for K2 clearly correlates with the financing perspective of the Structural and Cohesion EU Funds (perspective 2007–2013) and the 2012 UEFA Championships in Poland/Ukraine, which triggered a lot of construction works.\nI find the presented approach very promising. It enabled for automatic detection of many meaningful themes and provided interpretable time trends. The results of LDA may be in future applied to improve information retrieval and facilitate tasks such as clustering, searching or similar documents finding. Moreover, it could also form a valuable input material for various analyses or reports prepared by legal experts.\nAcknowledgments.
