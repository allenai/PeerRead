      "text" : "Constructing large knowledge bases (KBs) supports downstream reasoning about resolved entities and their relations, rather than the noisy textual evidence surrounding their natural language mentions. For this reason KBs have been of increasing interest in both industry and academia (Bollacker et al., 2008; Suchanek et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010). Such KBs typically contain many millions of facts, most of them (entity1,relation,entity2) “triples” (also known as binary relations) such as (Barack Obama, presi-\ndentOf, USA) and (Brad Pitt, marriedTo, Angelina Jolie).\nHowever, even the largest KBs are woefully incomplete (Min et al., 2013), missing many important facts, and therefore damaging their usefulness in downstream tasks. Ironically, these missing facts can frequently be inferred from other facts already in the KB, thus representing a sort of inconsistency that can be repaired by the application of an automated process. The addition of new triples by leveraging existing triples is typically known as KB completion.\nEarly work on this problem focused on learning symbolic rules. For example, Schoenmackers et al. (2010) learns Horn clauses predictive of new binary relations by exhausitively exploring relational paths of increasing length, and selecting those surpassing an accuracy threshold. (A “path” is a sequence of triples in which the second entity of each triple matches the first entity of the next triple.) Lao et al. (2011) introduced the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA), which greatly improves efficiency and robustness by replacing exhaustive search with random walks, and using unique paths as features in a per-target-relation binary classifier. A typical predictive feature learned by PRA is that CountryOfHeadquarters(X, Y) is implied by IsBasedIn(X,A) and StateLocatedIn(A, B) and CountryLocatedIn(B, Y). Given IsBasedIn(Microsoft, Seattle), StateLocatedIn(Seattle, Washington) and CountryLocatedIn(Washington, USA), we can infer the fact CountryOfHeadquarters(Microsoft, USA) using the predictive feature. In later work, Lao et al. (2012) greatly increase available raw material for paths by augmenting KB-schema relations with relations defined by the text connecting mentions of entities in a large corpus (also known as OpenIE relations (Banko et al., 2007)).\nHowever, these symbolic methods can produce many millions of distinct paths, each of which is categorically distinct, treated by PRA as a dis-\nar X\niv :1\n50 4.\n06 66\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n7 M\nay 2\n01 5\ntinct feature. (See Figure 1.) Even putting aside the OpenIE relations, this limits the applicability of these methods to modern KBs that have thousands of relation types, since the number of distinct paths increases rapidly with the number of relation types. If textually-defined OpenIE relations are included, the problem is obviously far more severe.\nBetter generalization can be gained by operating on embedded vector representations of relations, in which vector similarity can be interpreted as semantic similarity. For example, Bordes et al. (2013) learn low-dimensional vector representations of entities and KB relations, such that vector differences between two entities should be close to the vectors associated with their relations. This approach can find relation synonyms, and thus perform a kind of one-to-one, non-path-based relation prediction for KB completion. Similarly Nickel et al. (2011) and Socher et al. (2013a) perform KB completion by learning embeddings of relations, but based on matrices or tensors. Universal schema (Riedel et al., 2013) learns to perform relation prediction cast as matrix completion (likewise using vector embeddings), but predicts textuallydefined OpenIE relations as well as KB relations, and embeds entity-pairs in addition to individual entities. Like all of the above, it also reasons about individual relations, not the evidence of a connected path of relations.\nThis paper proposes an approach combining the advantages of (a) reasoning about conjunctions of relations connected in a path, and (b) generalization through vector embeddings, and (c) reasoning non-atomically and compositionally about the elements of the path, for further generalization.\nOur method uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Werbos, 1990) to compose the semantics of relations in an arbitrary-length path. At each path-step it consumes both the vector embedding of the next relation, and the vector representing the path-so-far, then outputs a composed vector (representing the extended path-so-far), which will be the input to the next step. After consuming a path, the RNN should output a vector in the semantic neighborhood of the relation between the first and last entity of the path. For example, after consuming the relation vectors along the path Melinda Gates → Bill Gates → Microsoft → Seattle, our method produces a vector very close to the relation livesIn.\nOur compositional approach allow us at test time to make predictions from paths that were unseen during training, because of the generalization provided by vector neighborhoods, and because they are composed in non-atomic fashion. This allows our model to seamlessly perform inference on many millions of paths in the KB graph. In most of our experiments, we learn a separate RNN for predicting each relation type, but alternatively, by learning a single high-capacity composition function for all relation types, our method can perform zero-shot learning—predicting new relation types for which the composition function was never explicitly trained.\nRelated to our work, new versions of PRA (Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner et al., 2014) use pre-trained vector representations of relations to alleviate its feature explosion problem—but the core mechanism continues to be a classifier based on atomic-path features. In the 2013 work many paths are collapsed by clustering paths according to their relations’ embeddings, and substituting cluster ids for the original relation types. In the 2014 work unseen paths are mapped to nearby paths seen at training time, where nearness is measured using the embeddings. Neither is able to perform zero-shot learning since there must be a classifer for each predicted relation type. Furthermore their pre-trained vectors do not have the opportunity to be tuned to the KB completion task because the two sub-tasks are completely disentangled.\nAn additional contribution of our work is a new large-scale data set of over 52 million triples, and its preprocessing for purposes of path-based KB completion (can be downloaded from http: //iesl.cs.umass.edu/downloads/ inferencerules/release.tar.gz). The dataset is build from the combination of Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and Google’s entity linking in ClueWeb (Orr et al., 2013). Rather than Gardner’s 1000 distinct paths per relation type, we have over 2 million. Rather than Gardner’s 200\nentity pairs, we use over 10k. All experimental comparisons below are performed on this new data set.\nOn this challenging large-scale dataset our compositional method outperforms PRA (Lao et al., 2012), and Cluster PRA (Gardner et al., 2013) by 11% and 7% respectively. A further contribution of our work is a new, surprisingly strong baseline method using classifiers of path bigram features, which beats PRA and Cluster PRA, and statistically ties our compositional method. Our analysis shows that our method has substantially different strengths than the new baseline, and the combination of the two yields a 15% improvement over Gardner et al. (2013). We also show that our zeroshot model is indeed capable of predicting new unseen relation types."

We use PRA to find millions of distinct paths per relation type. We do not use the random walk probabilities given by PRA since using it did not yield improvements in our experiments."

The vector representation of a phrase (w1, w2) consisting of words w1 and w2 is given by f(W [v(w1); v(w2)]) where v(w) ∈ Rd is the vector representation of w, f is an element-wise non linearity function, [a; b] represents the concatenation two vectors a and b along with a bias term, and W ∈ Rd×2∗d+1 is the composition matrix. This operation can be repeated to construct vector representations of longer phrases."

      "text" : "This paper proposes a RNN model for KB completion that reasons on the paths connecting an entity pair to predict missing relation types. The vector representations of the paths (of any length) in the KB graph are computed by applying the composition function recursively as shown in Figure 2. To compute the vector representations for the higher nodes in the tree, the composition function consumes the vector representation of the node’s two children nodes and outputs a new vector of the same dimension. Predictions about missing relation types are made by comparing the vector representation of the path with the vector representation of the relation using the sigmoid function.\nWe represent each binary relation using a ddimensional real valued vector. We model composition using recurrent neural networks (Werbos, 1990). We learn a separate composition matrix for every relation that is predicted.\nLet vr(δ) ∈ Rd be the vector representation of relation δ and vp(π) ∈ Rd be the vector representation of path π. vp(π) denotes the relation vector if path π is of length one. To predict relation δ = CountryOfHeadquarters, the vector representation of the path π = IsBasedIn → StateLocatedIn containing two relations IsBasedIn and StateLocatedIn is computed by (Figure 2),\nvp(π) =\nf(Wδ[vr(IsBasedIn); vr(StateLocatedIn)])\nwhere f = sigmoid is the element-wise nonlinearity function, Wδ ∈ Rd∗2d+1 is the composition matrix for δ = CountryOfHeadquarters and [a; b] represents the concatenation of two vectors a ∈ Rd, b ∈ Rd along with a bias feature to get a new vector [a; b] ∈ R2d+1.\nThe vector representation of the path Π = IsBasedIn → StateLocatedIn → CountryLocatedIn in Figure 2 is computed similarly by,\nvp(Π) =\nf(Wδ[vp(π); vr( CountryLocatedIn)])\nwhere vp(π) is the vector representation of path IsBasedIn→ StateLocatedIn. While computing the vector representation of a path we always traverse left to right, composing the relation vector in the right with the accumulated path vector in the left1. This makes our model a recurrent neural network (Werbos, 1990).\nFinally, we make a prediction regarding CountryOfHeadquarters(Microsoft, USA) using the path Π = IsBasedIn → StateLocatedIn → CountryLocatedIn by comparing the vector representation of the path (vp(Π)) with the vector representation of the relation CountryOfHeadquarters (vr(CountryOfHeadquarters)) using the sigmoid function."

Unlike in previous work that use RNNs(Socher et al., 2011; Iyyer et al., 2014; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014), a challenge with using them for our task is that among the set of paths connecting an entity pair, we do not observe which of the path(s) is predictive of a relation. We select the path that is closest to the relation type to be predicted in the vector space. This not only allows for faster training (compared to marginalization) but also gives improved performance. This technique has been successfully used in models other than RNNs previously (Weston et al., 2013; Neelakantan et al., 2014).\n1we did not get significant improvements when we tried more sophisticated ordering schemes for computing the path representations.\nAlgorithm 1 Training Algorithm of RNN model for relation δ\n1: Input: Λδ = Λ+δ ∪ Λ − δ ,Φδ, number of itera-\ntions T , mini-batch size B 2: Initialize vr,Wδ randomly 3: for t = 1, 2, . . . , T do 4: ∇vr = 0, ∇Wδ = 0 and b = 0 5: for λ = (γ, δ) ∈ Λδ do 6: µλ = arg maxπ∈Φδ(γ) vp(π).vr(δ) 7: Accumulate gradients to∇vr, ∇Wδ 8: using path µλ. 9: b = b+ 1\n10: if b = B then 11: Gradient Update for vr,Wδ 12: ∇vr = 0,∇Wδ = 0 and b = 0 13: end if 14: end for 15: if b > 0 then 16: Gradient Update for vr,Wδ 17: end if 18: end for 19: Output: vr,Wδ\nWe assume that we are given a KB (for example, Freebase enriched with SVO triples) containing a set of entity pairs Γ, set of relations ∆ and a set of observed facts Λ+ where ∀λ = (γ, δ) ∈ Λ+(γ ∈ Γ, δ ∈ ∆) indicates a positive fact that entity pair γ is in relation δ. Let Φδ(γ) denote the set of paths connecting entity pair γ given by PRA for predicting relation δ.\nIn our task, we only observe the set of paths connecting an entity pair but we do not observe which of the path(s) is predictive of the fact. We treat this as a latent variable (µλ for the fact λ) and we assign µλ the path whose vector representation has maximum dot product with the vector representation of the relation to be predicted. For example, µλ for the fact λ = (γ, δ) ∈ Λ+ is given by,\nµλ = arg max π∈Φδ(γ) vp(π).vr(δ)\nDuring training, we assign µλ using the current parameter estimates. We use the same procedure to assign µλ for unobserved facts that are used as negative examples during training.\nWe train a separate RNN model for predicting each relation and the parameters of the model for predicting relation δ ∈ ∆ are Θ = {vr(ω)∀ω ∈ ∆, Wδ}.

The relation vectors and the composition matrix are initialized randomly. We train the network using backpropagation through structure (Goller and Küchler, 1996)."

      "text" : "The KB completion task involves predicting facts on thousands of relations types and it is highly desirable that a method can infer facts about relation types without directly training for them. Given the vector representation of the relations, we show that our model described in the previous section is capable of predicting relational facts without explicitly training for the target (or test) relation types (zero-shot learning).\nIn zero-shot or zero-data learning (Larochelle et al., 2008; Palatucci et al., 2009), some labels or classes are not available during training the model and only a description of those classes are given at prediction time. We make two modifications to the model described in the previous section, (1) learn a general composition matrix, and (2) fix relation vectors with pre-trained vectors, so that we can predict relations that are unseen during training. This ability of the model to generalize to unseen relations is beyond the capabilities of all previous methods for KB inference (Schoenmackers et al., 2010; Lao et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner et al., 2014).\nWe learn a general composition matrix for all relations instead of learning a separate composition matrix for every relation to be predicted. So,\n2we sub-sample a portion of the set of all unobserved instances.\nfor example, the vector representation of the path π = IsBasedIn→ StateLocatedIn containing two relations IsBasedIn and StateLocatedIn is computed by (Figure 2),\nvp(π) =\nf(W [vr(IsBasedIn); vr(StateLocatedIn)])\nwhere W ∈ Rd∗2d+1 is the general composition matrix.\nWe initialize the vector representations of the binary relations (vr) using the representations learned in Riedel et al. (2013) and do not update them during training. The relation vectors are not updated because at prediction time we would be predicting relation types which are never seen during training and hence their vectors would never get updated. We learn only the general composition matrix in this model. We train a single model for a set of relation types by replacing the sigmoid function with a softmax function while computing probabilities and the parameters of the composition matrix are learned using the available training data containing instances of few relations. The other aspects of the model remain unchanged.\nTo predict facts whose relation types are unseen during training, we compute the vector representation of the path using the general composition matrix and compute the probability of the fact using the pre-trained relation vector. For example, using the vector representation of the path Π = IsBasedIn → StateLocatedIn → CountryLocatedIn in Figure 2, we can predict any relation irrespective of whether they are seen at training by comparing it with the pre-trained relation vectors."

Hence, we create nodes only for Freebase entities in our KB graph. We remove facts containing /type/object/type as they do not give useful predictive information for our task. We get triples from ClueWeb by considering sentences that contain two entities linked to Freebase. We extract the phrase between the two entities and treat them as the relation types. For phrases that are of length greater than four we keep only the first and last two words. This helps us to avoid the time consuming step of dependency parsing the sentence to get the relation type. These triples are similar to facts obtained by OpenIE (Banko et al., 2007). To reduce noise, we select relation types that occur at least 50 times. We evaluate on 46 relation types in Freebase that have the most number of instances. The methods are evaluated on a subset of facts in Freebase that were hidden during training.

      "text" : "Using our dataset, we compare the performance of the following methods: PRA Classifier is the method in Lao et al. (2012) which trains a logistic regression classifier by creating a feature for every path type. Cluster PRA Classifier is the method in Gardner et al. (2013) which replaces relation types from ClueWeb triples with their cluster membership in the KB graph before the path finding step. Af-\nter this step, their method proceeds in exactly the same manner as Lao et al. (2012) training a logistic regression classifier by creating a feature for every path type. We use pre-trained relation vectors from Riedel et al. (2013) and use k-means clustering to cluster the relation types to 25 clusters as done in Gardner et al. (2013). Composition-Add uses a simple element-wise addition followed by sigmoid non-linearity as the composition function similar to Yang et al. (2014). RNN-random is the supervised RNN model described in section 3 with the relation vectors initialized randomly. RNN is the supervised RNN model described in section 3 with the relation vectors initialized using the method in Riedel et al. (2013). PRA Classifier-b is our simple extension to the method in Lao et al. (2012) which additionally uses bigrams in the path as features. We add a special start and stop symbol to the path before computing the bigram features. Cluster PRA Classifier-b is our simple extension to the method in Gardner et al. (2013) which additionally uses bigram features computed as previously described. RNN + PRA Classifier combines the predictions of RNN and PRA Classifier. We combine the predictions by assigning the score of a fact as the sum of their rank in the two models after sorting them in ascending order. RNN + PRA Classifier-b combines the predictions of RNN and PRA Classifier-b using the technique described previously.\nTable 3 shows the results of our experiments. The method described in Gardner et al. (2014) is not included in the table since the publicly available implementation does not scale to our large dataset. First, we show that it is better to train the models using all the path types instead of using only the top 1, 000 path types as done in previous work (Gardner et al., 2013; Gardner et al., 2014). We can see that the RNN model performs significantly better than the baseline methods of Lao et al. (2012) and Gardner et al. (2013). The performance of the RNN model is not affected by initialization since using random vectors and pre-trained vectors results in similar performance.\nA surprising result is the impressive performance of our simple extension to the classifier approach. After the addition of bigram features, the naive PRA method is as effective as the Clus-\nter PRA method. The small difference in performance between RNN and both PRA Classifier-b and Cluster PRA Classifier-b is not statistically significant. We conjecture that our method has\nsubstantially different strengths than the new baseline. While the classifier with bigram features has an ability to accurately memorize important local structure, the RNN model generalizes better to un-\nseen paths that are very different from the paths seen is training. Empirically, combining the predictions of RNN and PRA Classifier-b achieves a statistically significant gain over PRA Classifier-b."

We evaluate on randomly selected 10 (out of 46) relation types, hence for the fully supervised version we train 10 RNNs, one for each relation type. For evaluating the zero-shot model, we randomly split the relations into two sets of equal size and train a zero-shot model on one set and test on the other set. So, in this case we have two RNNs making predictions on relation types that they have never seen during training. As expected, the fully supervised RNN outperforms the zero-shot model by a large margin but the zero-shot model without using any direct supervision clearly performs much better than a random baseline."

Apart from RNN and RNN-random, we trained three more RNNs with different random initialization and the performance of the three RNNs individually are 57.09, 57.11 and 56.91. The performance of the ensemble is 59.16 and their performance stopped improving after using three RNNs. So, this indicates that even though multiple local optima affects the\nperformance, it is likely not the only issue since the performance of the ensemble is still less than the performance of RNN + PRA Classifier-b.\nWe suspect the RNN model does not capture some of the important local structure as well as the classifier using bigram features. To overcome this drawback, in future work, we plan to explore compositional models that have a longer memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; Mikolov et al., 2014). We also plan to include vector representations for the entities and develop models that address the issue of polysemy in verb phrases (Cheng et al., 2014)."

Most previous methods infer simple one-hop relational synonyms like this, or use as evidence a multi-hop relational path treated as an atomic feature, like bornIn(X,Z)→ containedIn(Z,Y). This paper presents an approach that reasons about conjunctions of multi-hop relations non-atomically, composing the implications of a path using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that takes as inputs vector embeddings of the binary relation in the path. Not only does this allow us to generalize to paths unseen at training time, but also, with a single high-capacity RNN, to predict new relation types not seen when the compositional model was trained (zero-shot learning). We assemble a new dataset of over 52M relational triples, and show that our method improves over a traditional classifier by 11%, and a method leveraging pre-trained embeddings by 7%.",
