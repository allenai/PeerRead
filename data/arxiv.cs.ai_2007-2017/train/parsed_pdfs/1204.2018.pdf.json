      "text" : "Broadly construed Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is the process of solving new problems based on the solution of past problems. The CBR systems’ expertise is embodied in a collection (library) of past cases rather, than being encoded in classical rules. Each case typically contains a description of the problem plus a solution and/or the outcomes. When a problem is successfully solved, the experience is retained in order to solve similar problems in future. When an attempt to solve a problem fails, the reason for the failure is identified and remembered in order to avoid the same mistake in future. Thus CBR is a cyclic and integrated process of solving a problem, learning from this experience, solving a new problem, etc. A case-library can be a powerful corporate resource allowing everyone in an organization to tap in the corporate library, when\nSubbotin & Voskoglou\nhandling a new problem. CBR allows the case-library to be developed incrementally, while its maintenance is relatively easy and can be carried out by domain experts. As an intelligent-systems’ method CBR enables information managers to increase efficiency and reduce cost by substantially automating processes such as diagnosis, scheduling and design. CBR has been formalized for purposes of computer and human reasoning as a four steps process. These steps involve: R1: Retrieve the most similar to the new problem past case. R2: Reuse the information and knowledge of the retrieved case for the solution of the new problem. R3: Revise the proposed solution. R4: Retain the part of this experience likely to be useful for future problemsolving. Riesbeck and Bain [11], Slade [12], Lei et al. [9], Aamodt and Plaza [1], Voskoglou ([17], [20]), etc have provided detailed flowcharts illustrating the steps of the CBR process."

      "text" : "Created by Zadeh [24], fuzzy logic has been successfully developed by many researchers and has been proven to be extremely productive in many applications (see, for example, [2], [6], [7], [18], [21], [22], [23] and others). There are also some interesting attempts to implement fuzzy logic ideas in the field of education ([4], [9], [10], [13], [16], [19], [22], etc). Voskoglou in the articles [18] and [21] has developed a fuzzy set model for describing a CBR system. In the following few paragraphs we cite parts of these articles. “Let us consider a CBR system whose library contains n past cases, n≥2. We denote by Ri , i=1,2,3 , the steps of retrieval, reuse and revision and by a, b, c, d, and e the linguistic labels of negligible, low, intermediate, high and complete degree of success respectively for each of the Ri’s. Set\nU={a, b, c, d, e}\nWe are going to represent Ri’s as fuzzy sets in U. For this, if nie, nid, nic, nib and nia respectively denote the number of cases where it has been achieved negligible, low, intermediate, high and complete degree of success for the state Ri i=1,2,3, we define the membership function mRi in terms of the frequencies, i.e. by\nmRi(x)= n\nnix\nfor each x in U. Thus we can write\nRi = {(x, n\nnix ) : x∈U}, i=1,2,3\nThe reason, for which we didn’t include the last step R4 of the CBR process in our fuzzy representation, is that all past cases, either successful, or not, are\nSome Applications of Fuzzy Logic…\nretained in the system’s library and therefore there is no fuzziness in this case. In other words keeping the same notation we have that n4a=n4b=n4c=n4d=0 and n4e=1. In order to represent all possible profiles (overall states) of a case during the CBR process, we consider a fuzzy relation, say R, in U 3 of the form\nR={(s, mR(s)) : s=(x, y, z) ∈U 3 }\nTo determine properly the membership function mR we give the following definition:\nA triple is said to be well ordered if x corresponds to a degree of success equal or greater than y, and y corresponds to a degree of acquisition equal or greater than z.\nFor example, the profile (c, c, a) is well ordered, while (b, a, c) is not. We define now the membership degree of s to be\nmR(s)=m 1R (x)m 2R (y)m 3R (z)\nif s is a well ordered profile, and zero otherwise. In fact, if for example (b, a, c) possessed a nonzero membership degree, given that the degree of success at the step of reuse is negligible how the proposed solution could be revised? In order to simplify our notation we shall write ms instead of mR(s). Then the possibility rs of the profile s is given by\nrs= }max{ s\ns\nm\nm\nwhere max{ms} denotes the maximal value of ms , for all s in U 3 . In other words rs is the “relative membership degree” of s with respect to the other profiles”. Further, Voskoglou ( [18], [21]) argues that the total possibilistic uncertainty T(r) (i.e. the sum of strife and non specificity [8, p.28]) on the ordered possibility distribution r of the profiles of a CBR system can be used as a measure of its efficiency in solving problems related to its cases. In fact, the amount of information obtained by an action can be measured by the reduction of uncertainty resulting from this action. Accordingly system’s uncertainty during the CBR process is connected to its capacity in obtaining relevant information. The lower is T(r) (which means grater reduction of the system’s uncertainty) the greater the system’s efficiency in solving related problems. In order to illustrate the use of his model in practice Voskoglou [18] presented the following EXAMPLE: “Let us consider a CBR system with an existing library of 105 past cases, where in no case there was a failure at the step of retrieval of a past case for the solution of the corresponding problem. More explicitly, let us assume that in 51 cases we had an intermediate success in retrieving a suitable past case, in 24 cases high, and in 30 cases we had a complete success respectively. Of course the existence of a certain criterion is necessary in order to be able to characterize the degree of success of retrieval for each of the past cases. Thus the step of retrieval can be represented as a fuzzy set in U as\nSubbotin & Voskoglou\nR1 = {(a,0),(b,0),(c, 105 51 ),(d, (),105 24 e, 105 30 )}.\nAssume further that in a similar way we obtained that\nR2 = {(a, 105 18 ),(b, 105 18 ),(c, 105 48 ),(d, 105 21 ),(e,0)},\nand\nR3 = {(a, 105 36 ),(b, 105 30 ),(c, 105 39 ),(d,0),(e,0)}.\nIt is a straightforward process now to calculate the membership degrees of all the possible profiles (see [18]; column of ms(1) in Table 1). For example, if s=(c, b, a), then\nms=m 1R (c).m 2R (b).m 3R (a)= =\n105 36 105 18 105 51 ≈0,029 .\nIt turns out that (c, c, c) is the profile with the maximal membership degree 0,082 and therefore the possibility of each s in U 3\nis given by rs= 082,0 sm ”.\nCalculating the possibilities of the 5 3 =125 (ordered samples with replacement of 3 objects out of 5) in total profiles Voskoglou found that the total possibilistic uncertainty of the system is 2,97. Next he considered another CBR system, designed for the solution of the same type of problems, with an existing library of 90 past cases and working as before he found that\nR1={(a,0),(b, 90 18 ),(c, 90 45 ),(d, 90 27 ),(e,0)},\nR2={(a, 90 18 ),(b, 90 24 ),(c, 90 48 ),(d, 0),(e,0)},\nand\nR3={(a, 90 36 ),(b, 90 27 ),(c, 90 27 ),(d,0),(e,0)}.\nFrom the calculation of all possible profiles it turns out that (c, c, a) is the profile possessing the maximal membership degree 0,107 and therefore the possibility of each s is given by rs= 107,0 sm Calculating the possibilities of all profiles Voskoglou ([18], [21]) found that T(r)=2,322 Thus, since 2,322<2,97 the effectiveness of the second system in solving new related problems is better than that of the first one. Notice that in general, the more are the stored past cases in the system’s library, the greater is expected to be its effectiveness in solving new related problems. In fact, the more are the past cases, the greater is the probability for a new problem to fit satisfactorily to one of them. Therefore the fact that the second system was found to be more effective than the first one, although not impossible to happen, it is rather unexpected in general.\nSome Applications of Fuzzy Logic…"

      "text" : "The following model employs a different approach to a comprehensive\nassessment. The main base of this approach has been developed in [13]. This\napproach is visible, does not implement any complicated calculations on the final\nstep, and, what is important, can be employed to a single case’s assessment and to\nthe system’s assessment as well.\nIn the fuzzy systems, there is a commonly used approach to measure the performance by graphically representing the information as a two dimensional figure F and work with coordinates of the center of mass Fc (xc, yc) of this figure (see for example, ([3], [5], [15]). We can calculate it using the following well-known formulas:\n(1) ,F Fc c\nF F\nxdxdy ydxdy\nx y dxdy dxdy\n= = ∫∫ ∫∫\n∫∫ ∫∫ .\nAs any assessment, our approach is very approximate.

We can measure the effectiveness using the following numerical point distribution: ∈α [0,1), b∈[1,2), c∈[2,3), d ∈[3,4) and e ∈[4,5]. Now formulas (2) will be transformed into the following formulas:\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3 5 7 91 , 2\n1 . 2\nSince we can assume that\n1,\nc\nc\ny y y y y x\ny y y y y\ny y y y y y\ny y y y y\ny y y y y\n + + + + =  + + + + \n + + + + =  \n+ + + + \n+ + + + =\nwe can write\n(3)\n( )\n( )\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 3 5 7 9 , 2\n1\n2\nc\nc\nx y y y y y\ny y y y y y\n= + + + +\n= + + + +\nwhere yi , 1 ≤ i ≤5, is the ratio of the cases in the system having the labels a, b, c, d, and e to the numbers of all cases in the system.\nWith the help of some elementary inequalities it is not difficult to establish that\nthe unique minimum is reached at the point Fm (2.5, 1\n10 ) when\ny1 = y2 = y3 = y4 = y5 = 1\n5 .\nIndeed, since\nSome Applications of Fuzzy Logic…\n1 2 3 4 5\n2\n1 2 3 4 5\n2 2 2 2 22\n1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2 3 2 4 2 5\n2 2 2 2 2\n3 4 3 5 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 2\n1,\n( ) 1.\nTherefore\n( )\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2\ny y y y y\ny y y y y\ny y y y y y y y y y\ny y y y y y y y y y y y y y\ny y y y y y y y y y y\ny y y y y y y y y\n+ + + + =\n+ + + + =\n+ + + + = + + + + +\n+ + + + + + + +\n+ + + ≤ + + + + +\n+ + + + + + + +\n( )\n2 2\n3\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 4 2 5 3 4 3 5 4 5\n2 2 2 2 2\n1 2 3 4 5\n1 2 3 2 5\n1 2 3 4 5\n5( )\nwhere the equality holds in the case when\n1 . 5\nIn this case,\n1 3 5 7 9 2.5.\n2 c\ny\ny y y y y y y y y y\ny y y y y\ny y y y y\nx y y y y y\n+ +\n+ + + + + + + + + =\n= + + + +\n= = = = =\n= + + + + =\nThe ideal case is when y1=y2=y3=y4=0 and y5=1. Then from formulas (3) we get\nthat xc = 2\n9 and yc =\n2\n1 . Therefore the center of mass in this case is the point Fi\n( 2\n9 ,\n2\n1 ).\nOn the other hand the worst case is when y1=1 and y2=y3=y4= y5=0. Then for\nformulas (3) we find that the center of mass is the point Fw ( 2\n1 ,\n2\n1 ).\nNow we can formulate our criterion for comparing the two groups’\nperformances in the following form (for more details see [14]) :\nAmong two or more groups the group with the biggest xc performs better;\n(4) If two or more groups have the same xc ≥ 2.5, then the group with the higher yc performs better. If two or more groups have the same xc ≤ 2.5, then the group with the lower yc performs better.\nIn the experiment illustrated the Voskoglou’s model above, the step of\nretrieval can be represented as the following\nR11 = {(a,0),(b,0),(c, 105 51 ),(d, (),105 24 e, 105 30 )}.\nSubbotin & Voskoglou\nAssume further that in a similar way we obtained that\nR12 = {(a, 105 18 ),(b, 105 18 ),(c, 105 48 ),(d, 105 21 ),(e,0)},\nand\nR13 = {(a, 105 36 ),(b, 105 30 ),(c, 105 39 ),(d,0),(e,0)}.\nNext we considered another CBR system, designed for the solution of the same type of problems, with an existing library we found that\nR21={(a,0),(b, 90 18 ),(c, 90 45 ),(d, 90 27 ),(e,0)},\nR22={(a, 90 18 ),(b, 90 24 ),(c, 90 48 ),(d, 0),(e,0)},\nand\nR23={(a, 90 36 ),(b, 90 27 ),(c, 90 27 ),(d,0),(e,0)}.\nIn the step one we have\n11\n2 2 2\n11\n1 51 24 30 5 7 9 2 105 105 105\n1 255 168 270 1 693 3.3, 2 105 105 105 2 105\n1 51 24 30\n2 105 105 105\n1 2601 576 900 1 4077 0.185. 2 11025 11025 11025 2 11025\nc\nc\nx\ny\n = ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ =   \n = + + = ⋅ =   \n  = + + = \n \n   = + + = ≈       \n21\n2 2 2\n21\n1 18 45 27 3 5 7 2 90 90 90\n1 54 225 189 1 468 2.6, 2 90 90 90 2 90\n1 18 45 27\n2 90 90 90\n1 324 2025 729\n2 8100 8100 8100\n1 3078 0.19. 2 8100\nc\nc\nx\ny\n = ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ =   \n   = + + = =       \n  = + + = \n \n + + =   \n = =   \nSome Applications of Fuzzy Logic…\nBy the criterion (4), the first group demonstrates significantly better performance.\nIn the step two, we have\nR12 = {(a, 105 18 ),(b, 105 18 ),(c, 105 48 ),(d, 105 21 ),(e,0)},\nR22={(a, 90 18 ),(b, 90 24 ),(c, 90 48 ),(d, 0),(e,0)},\nand respectively\n12\n2 2 2 2\n12\n1 18 18 48 21 3 5 7 2 105 105 105 105\n1 459 2.186, 2 105\n1 18 18 48 21\n2 105 105 105 105\n1 3393 0.154. 2 11025\nc\nc\nx\ny\n = + ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ =   \n = ≈   \n  = + + + = \n \n = ≈   \n22\n2 2 2\n22\n1 18 24 48 1 18 72 240 3 5 2 90 90 90 2 90 90 90\n1 330 1.833, 2 90\n1 18 24 48 1 3204 0.198. 2 90 90 90 2 8100\nc\nc\nx\ny\n   = + ⋅ + ⋅ = + +       \n = ≈   \n   = + + = ≈      \nBy the criterion (4), the first group again demonstrates better performance.\nAnd in the final third step we have\nR13 = {(a, 105 36 ),(b, 105 30 ),(c, 105 39 ),(d,0),(e,0)},\nR23={(a, 90 36 ),(b, 90 27 ),(c, 90 27 ),(d,0),(e,0)},\nand respectively\n13\n2 2 2\n13\n1 36 30 39 1 321 3 5 1.529, 2 105 105 105 2 105\n1 36 30 39 1 3717 0.169 2 105 105 105 2 11025\nc\nc\nx\ny\n   = + ⋅ + ⋅ = ≈       \n   = + + = ≈      \n23\n2 2 2\n13\n1 36 27 27 1 252 3 5 1.4, 2 90 90 90 2 90\n1 36 27 27 1 2754 0.17 2 90 90 90 2 8100\nc\nc\nx\ny\n   = + ⋅ + ⋅ = =       \n   = + + = =      \nSubbotin & Voskoglou\nSo in this step, the performances of both groups are close, but the first group\nperforms slightly better..\nBased on our calculation we can conclude that the first group demonstrated better\nat all three steps.

      "text" : "CBR is one of the central ideas in the nowadays artificial intelligence. Its applications are especially efficient in helping information managers to increase efficiency and reduce cost by substantially automating processes. Applying fuzzy logic to formalization of the CBR process helps in obtaining quantitative information for this process (comparing systems’ performances, etc), as well as a qualitative view on the degree of success at the successive steps of the CBR process through the calculation of the possibilities of all system’s profiles. The described in the article fuzzy models help the users to get specific concrete information regarding the existing CBR systems and to choose the appropriate one for the solution of their problems. We emphasize the fact that these two models are treating differently the idea of a CBR system’s performance. In fact, in Voskoglou’s model the system’s uncertainty during the CBR process is connected to its capacity in obtaining the relevant information. Under this sense, the lower is the system’s total possibilitic uncertainty (which means greater reduction of the initially existing uncertainty), the better is its performance. On the other hand, in Subbotin’s model the weighted average plays the main role, i.e. the result of the performance close to the ideal performance have much more weight than the one close to the lower end. In other words, while the first model is looking to the average performance, the second one is mostly looking at the quality of the performance. Therefore some differences could appear in boundary cases. This explains why, in the example presented in this paper, according to Voskoglou’s model the first system was found to have a better performance than the second one, while just the opposite happened according to Subbotin’s model. In concluding, it is argued that a combined use of the two models helps in founding the ideal profile of performance according to the user’s personal criteria of goals and therefore to choose the use of the appropriate CBR system, among the existing ones, for solving his/her problem.\nSome Applications of Fuzzy Logic…"
