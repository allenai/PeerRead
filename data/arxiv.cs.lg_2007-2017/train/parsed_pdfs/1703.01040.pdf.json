      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the important abilities of humans (and animals) is that they are able to learn new activities and their motor controls from others’ behaviors. When a person watches others performing an activity, he/she not only learns to visually predict future consequences of the motion during the activity but also learns how to execute the activity himself/herself.\nRecently, approaches taking advantage of “deep learning” for robot manipulation have been gaining an increasing amount of attention, directly learning motor control policies given visual inputs (i.e., images and videos) [1]. The use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been particularly successful, since they are able to jointly learn image features optimized for the task based on their training data. Because of such ability, new models incorporating convolutional and recurrent neural networks (i.e., CNNs and RNNs) is likely to become a major trend in robotics, just like what already happened in computer vision and machine learning.\nHowever, although these deep learning oriented approaches showed very promising results on learning video prediction [2] and actual motor control policy [1], they have been limited to relatively simple actions such as object grasping and pushing. This is because a large amount of ‘robot’ data is necessary for the direct training of these CNNs and RNNs with millions of parameters. A large number of samples of humans (or the robot itself) motor controlling the robot is necessary for generating training data [1], and this is\nSchool of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47408, USA. {leejang, mryoo}@indiana.edu\na limiting aspect particularly when we want to teach a robot new (i.e., previously unseen) activities.\nIn this paper, we present a new CNN-based approach that enables robot learning of its activities from ‘human’ example videos. Human activity videos can be attractive training resources because it does not require any hardware or professional software for teaching robots, even though it might create other difficulties like transferring learned human-based models to the actual robots. Given videos of humans executing the same activity from a human’s viewpoint (i.e., first-person videos), our objective is to make the robot learn the temporal structure of the activity as its future regression network, and learn to transfer such model for its own motor execution. The idea is that a human’s firstperson video and the video a humanoid robot is expected to obtain during its activity execution should be very similar. Providing first-person human videos to the robot is as if we are providing the robot ‘visual memory’ of itself performing the activities previously. This enables the robot to directly learn what visual observation it is expected to see during the correct execution of the activity and how it will change from its viewpoint.\nThere have been previous works on robot activity learning from human videos [3], [4], extending the previous concept of ‘robot learning from demonstration’ [5] which was mostly done with direct motor control data. However, these works focused on learning grammar representations of human activities, modeling human activities as a sequence of atomic actions (e.g., grasping). These approaches were limited in the aspect that activities were always represented in terms of pre-defined set of atomic actions, and the users had to teach the robot how to recognize those atomic actions from human activity videos by providing labeled training data (i.e., supervised learning). This prevented the robot learning of activities from scratch, and was also limited in that human had to define new atomic actions when a new activity is added. Furthermore, since it was not trainable in an end-toend fashion, the robot has to somehow figure out how to execute those atomic actions, which was usually done by hand-coding the motion.\nWe introduce a new robot activity learning model using a fully convolutional network for future representation regression. We extend the state-of-the-art convolutional object detection network (SSD [6]) for the representation of human hand-object information in a video frame, and newly introduce the concept of using a fully convolutional network to regress (i.e., predict) how such intermediate scene representation will change in the future frame (e.g., 1-2 seconds\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n01 04\n0v 2\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 2\n4 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nlater). Combining these allows direct and explicit prediction of future hand locations (Figure 1), which then allows the robot to infer the motor control plan. That is, not only feature-level prediction of future representations (similar to [7]) but also semantic-level prediction of explicit future hand locations of humans and robots during the learned activity is being jointly performed in our new network. Such future hand prediction results are used by our manipulation network that learns mapping of the 2-D hand locations in the image coordinate to the actual motor control.\nOur activity learning is an unsupervised approach in the aspect that it does not require activity labels or hand/object labels in the activity videos. It does require hand-annotated training data for the learning of its hand representation network, but there already exists public datasets for this purpose and it does not require any labels for its future regression network. The future regression network is learned without supervision by capturing changes in our hand-based representations in the training videos. In addition, importantly, all our networks were designed to function in real-time for the actual robot operation, and we show such capability with our experiments in this paper."

      "text" : "a) Robot learning from humans: There have been a considerable amount of previous efforts on robot learning\nfrom demonstration (LfD) [5], [8], [9]. Since it enables robots automatically learn a new task from demonstration by non-robotics expert, LfD is very important in robotics. However, there are limitations since most of these approaches focused on making robots learn motor control polices from human data, which usually was in the form of direct control sequences obtained with actual robots or simulation softwares [10]. Moreover, it often requires a knowledge about all primitive actions for teaching high-level tasks [11].\nThere also have been previous works on robot activity learning from visual data [3], [4], [12], extending the previous concept of LfD. These works focused on learning grammar representations of human activities from conventional third-person videos (i.e., videos usually taken with static cameras watching the actors), modeling human activities as a sequence of atomic actions (e.g., grasping). Having a grammar representation composed of atomic actions allows transfer of human activity structure to robots, and the robot replication of human activities was possible usually with hand-coded motion transfer from human atomic actions to robot atomic actions. However, activity learning was generally done in a fully supervised fashion with human annotations in these approaches, and they assumed very reliable estimation of semantic features from videos such human hands and human body skeletons. [13] studied an approach to directly learn object manipulation trajectories\nfrom human videos, but it was limited to one-robot-oneobject scenarios unlike our approach focusing on very general human-robot collaboration scenarios (e.g., humanobject-robot interactions).\nb) Video prediction: Our approach in this paper is to generate proper robot behaviors (particularly for humanrobot collaboration) by predicting ‘future’ visual representation. The idea is that such representation leads to the estimation of future positions of objects and hands of humans and robots. Visual prediction is one of the core components of our perception system.\nThere have been previous works on the prediction of future frames from the computer vision community [7], [14], [15]. However, there has been very limited attempt on applying such future predictions for robotics systems, since these approaches in general requires more components for interpreting predicted representation to generate robot actions. In the above works, no robot manipulation was actually attempted. There exists a recent robotics work that attempted applying visual prediction for generating robot control actions [16]. This study shows the potential in applying visual prediction for a robotic manipulation task; it enables transferring the visual perception to robot manipulation component for generating motor control commands without any additional components to interpret the recognition results. However, this requires a huge amount of training data using actual physical robots to make the robot learn activities, and thus is limited when the robot needs to learn many new activities.\nc) First-person videos: First-person videos, also called egocentric videos, are the videos taken from the actor’s own viewpoint. Recognition of human/robot activities from such first-person videos has been actively studied particularly in the past 5 years, including recognition of human actions from wearable cameras [17]–[20] and human-robot interactions from robot cameras [21], [22]. However, these focused on building discriminative video classifiers, and the attempt to learn ‘executable’ representations of human activities or their transfer to robots have been very limited.\nThe main contribution of this paper is in enabling robot activity learning from human interaction videos using our newly proposed convolutional future regression. We believe this is the first work to present a deep learning-based (i.e., entirely CNN-based) method for learning human-robot interactions from human-human videos. We also believe this is the first paper to take advantage of human ‘first-person videos’ for the robot activity learning."

We employ two components for achieving the goal. The first component is a perception component that consists of two fully convolutional neural networks: (1) an extended version of the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [6] to create\na hand-based scene representation and estimate bounding boxes, and (2) a future regression network to model how such intermediate scene representation (should) change in future frames. The second component is a manipulation component that maps 2-D hand locations in the image coordinate to the actual motor control using fully connected layers.\nThe key idea of our approach is that the proposed perception component allows prediction of future (1-2 seconds later) hand locations given current video input from a camera. Such future prediction can be learned based on humans’ firstperson activity videos by using them as training data, with the assumption that the robot camera has a similar viewpoint with the human first-person videos. This allows the robot to directly predict its ideal future hand locations during the activity, inferring how the hand should move if the activity were to be executed successfully. Next, the manipulation component generates actual robot control commands to move the robot’s hands to the predicted future locations."

We extended it by inserting a fully convolutional auto-encoder having five convolutional layers followed by five deconvolutional layers for dimensionality reduction. This allows the approach to abstract an image (with hands and objects) into a lower dimensional intermediate representation.\nAll our convolutional/deconvolutional layers use 5×5 kernels and the number of filters for each convolutional layer are: 512, 256, 128, 64, 256. The green convolutional layers in Fig. 1 correspond to them. After such convolutional layers, there are deconvolutional layers (yellow layers in Fig. 1), each having the symmetric number of filters: 256, 64, 128, 256, 512. We do not use any pooling layer, and instead use stride 2 for the last convolutional layer for the dimensionality reduction. We thus increase the number of filters for the last convolutional layer to compensate loss of information.\nLet f denote the hand representation network given an image at time t. Then, this network can be considered as a combination of two sub functions, f = g ◦ h:\nŶt = f(X̂t) = h(F̂t) = h(g(X̂t)), (1)\nwhere a function g : X̂ → F̂ denotes a feature extractor (from an input video frame to encoder) to get compressed intermediate visual representation (i.e., feature map) F̂, and h : F̂ → Ŷ indicates a box estimator which uses the compressed representation as an input for locating hand boxes at time t. With the above formulation, the network can predict hand locations Ŷt at time t after the training.\nb) Future Regression Network: Although the above hand representation network allows obtaining hand boxes in the ‘current’ frame, our objective is to get the ‘future’ hand locations Ŷt+∆ instead of theirs current locations Ŷt."

The main idea is that the intermediate representation of the hand representation network F̂t abstracts the hand-object information in the scene, and that we are able to take advantage of it to infer the future (intermediate) representation F̂t+∆. Once such regression becomes possible, we can simply plug-in the predicted future representation F̂t+∆ to the remaining part of the hand network (i.e., h) to obtain the final future hand prediction results. Therefore, we newly design a network for predicting the intermediate scene representation corresponding to the future frame F̂t+∆, as a fully convolutional future regression network: Fig. 2.\nGiven a current scene representation F̂t from the hand network, our future regression network (r) predicts the future the intermediate scene representation F̂t+∆:\nF̂t+∆ = rw(F̂t).

Finally, the future scene representation F̂t+∆ is fed into the hand network for estimating hand boxes corresponding to the future frame to get future hand locations Ŷt+∆.\nŶt+∆ = h(F̂t+∆) (4)\nFig. 2 summarizes data flow of our perception component during testing phase. Given a video frame X̂t at time t, (1) we extract the intermediate scene representation F̂t using the feature extractor (g), and then (2) feed it into the future regression network (r) to get future scene representation F̂t+∆. Next, (3) we feed F̂t+∆ into the box estimator (h), and finally obtain future position of hands Ŷt+∆ at time t.\nŶt+∆ = h(F̂t+∆) = h(r(F̂t)) = h(r(g(X̂t))) (5)\nFurthermore, instead of using just a single frame (i.e., the current frame) for the future regression, we extend our network to take advantage of the previous K frames to obtain F̂t+∆ as illustrated in Fig. 1:\nŶt+∆ = h(r([g(X̂t), ..., g(X̂t−(K−1))])). (6)\nThe advantage of our formulation is that it allows us to predict future hand locations while considering the implicit activity and object context, even without explicit detection of objects in the scene. Our auto-encoder-based intermediate representation F̂it abstracts the scene configuration by internally representing what objects/hands are currently in the scene and where they are, and our fully convolutional future regressor takes advantage of it for the prediction."

It has 4,800 frames with 15,053 ground-truth hand labels. Here, we added 466 frames with 1,267 groundtruth annotations to the original dataset to cover more hand postures. We use this dataset to learn our hand representation network, which is trained to locate hand boxes in a video frame.\nUnlabeled Human-Human Interaction Videos: We collected a total of 47 first-person videos of human-human collaboration scenarios, with each video clip ranging from 4 to 10 seconds. This dataset is a main dataset for teaching a new task to our robot. It contains two types of tasks: (1) a person wearing the camera cleaning up all objects on a table as a partner (i.e., the other subject) approaches the table while holding a heavy box (to make a room for her/him to put the heavy box on the table), and (2) a person wearing the camera pushing a trivet on a table toward to a partner when he/she is approaching the table while holding a hot cooking pan. These videos are unlabeled videos without any activity/hand annotation and we trained our convolutional regression network using this dataset.\nUnlabeled Robot Activity Log Files: We prepared this dataset to train our robot manipulation network. It contains 50 robot log files. Each log has the robot’s hand positions\n(u, v) in an image plane and the robot’s corresponding joint angles at time t. We recorded these log files by making a human operator move the robot arms (i.e., the human grabbed the robot arms and moved them). We obtained such robot joint configuration sequences while moving the robot to cover possible arm motion during general human-robot interaction tasks. Here, we assume that the robot is supposed to operate in a similar environment during the test phase. Note that this was not recorded under the interaction scenario (i.e., just the robot itself was moving), and no annotation regarding the activity or motion was provided. We used a Baxter research robot for recording these files and the Baxter has seven degrees-of-freedom arm: the file contains 9 variables for each arm. In order to estimate the robot’s hand position in the image plane, we projected the 3-D positions of the Baxter’s grippers into the image plane (based on camera calibration) and recorded the projected (u, v) positions with 7 joint angles at 30 Hz."

More specifically, it detects objects using KAZE features [24] and hands using CNN based hand detector in [23], then computes relative distances between all objects and hands for building the state representation which is a 20 dimensional vector.

Only when the ratio was greater than 0.5, the predicted box was accepted as a true positive.

Once more, we can confirm that our approaches greatly outperform the performance of all the baselines. The overall average distance was a bit high due to changes in human hand shapes and their variations, but they were sufficient in terms of generating robot motion.\nWe also compared accuracies of these methods while only considering my right hand predictions, since position of my right hand is more important for a robot manipulation than locations of other types of hands. This is because, in our test scenarios, the robot’s activities are very focused on its right hand motion. Table III shows mean pixel distance between ground truth and predicted position of ‘my right hand’. We can see that performances of our approaches are superior to all the baselines.

Given videos of humans executing the same activity from a human’s viewpoint (i.e., first-person videos), our objective is to make the robot learn the temporal structure of the activity as its future regression network, and learn to transfer such model for its own motor execution. We present a new deep learning model: We extend the state-of-the-art convolutional object detection network for the representation/estimation of human hands in training videos, and newly introduce the concept of using a fully convolutional network to regress (i.e., predict) the intermediate scene representation corresponding to the future frame (e.g., 1-2 seconds later). Combining these allows direct prediction of future locations of human hands and objects, which enables the robot to infer the motor control plan using our manipulation network. We experimentally confirm that our approach makes learning of robot activities from unlabeled human interaction videos possible, and demonstrate that our robot is able to execute the learned collaborative activities in real-time directly based on its camera input.",
