      "text" : "The comparison of heterogeneous samples extensively exists in many applications, especially in the task of image classification. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective coupled neural network, called Deeply Coupled Autoencoder Networks (DCAN), which seeks to build two deep neural networks, coupled with each other in every corresponding layers. In DCAN, each deep structure is developed via stacking multiple discriminative coupled auto-encoders, a denoising auto-encoder trained with maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty. This single layer component makes our model simultaneously preserve the local consistency and enhance its discriminative capability. With increasing number of layers, the coupled networks can gradually narrow the gap between the two views. Extensive experiments on cross-view image classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Real-world objects often have different views, which might be endowed with the same semantic. For example, face images can be captured in different poses, which reveal the identity of the same object; images of one face can also be in different modalities, such as pictures under different lighting condition, pose, or even sketches from artists. In many computer vision applications, such as im-\nage retrieval, interests are taken in comparing two types of heterogeneous images, which may come from different views or even different sensors. Since the spanned feature spaces are quite different, it is very difficult to classify these images across views directly. To decrease the discrepancy across views, most of previous works endeavored to learn view-specific linear transforms and to project cross-view samples into a common latent space, and then employed these newly generated features for classification.\nThough there are lots of approaches used to learn viewspecific projections, they can be divided roughly based on whether the supervised information is used. Unsupervised methods such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)[14] and Partial Least Square (PLS) [26] are employed to the task of cross-view recognition. Both of them attempt to use two linear mappings to project samples into a common space where the correlation is maximized, while PLS considers the variations rather than only the correlation in the target space. Besides, with use of the mutual information, a Coupled InformationTheoretic Encoding (CITE) method is developed to narrow the inter-view gap for the specific photo-sketch recognition task. And in [30], a semi-coupled dictionary is used to bridge two views. All the methods above consider to reduce the discrepancy between two views, however, the label information is not explicitly taken into account. With label information available, many methods were further developed to learn a discriminant common space For instance, Discriminative Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) [16] is proposed as an extension of CCA. And\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n20 31\nv1 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n1 0\nIn [22], with an additional local smoothness constraints, two linear projections are simultaneously learnt for Common Discriminant Feature Extraction (CDFE). There are also other such methods as the large margin approach [8] and the Coupled Spectral Regression (CSR) [20]. Recently, multi-view analysis [27, 15] is further developed to jointly learn multiple specific-view transforms when multiple views (usually more than 2 views) can be available.\nAlthough the above methods have been extensively applied in the cross-view problem, and have got encouraging performances, they all employed linear transforms to capture the shared features of samples from two views. However, these linear discriminant analysis methods usually depend on the assumption that the data of each class agrees with a Gaussian distribution, while data in real world usually has a much more complex distribution [33]. It indicates that linear transforms are insufficient to extract the common features of cross-view images. So it’s natural to consider about learning nonlinear features.\nA recent topic of interest in nonlinear learning is the research in deep learning. Deep learning attempts to learn nonlinear representations hierarchically via deep structures, and has been applied successfully in many computer vision problems. Classical deep learning methods often stack or compose multiple basic building blocks to yield a deeper structure. See [5] for a recent review of Deep Learning algorithms. Lots of such basic building blocks have been proposed, including sparse coding [19], restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [12], autoencoder [13, 6], etc. Specifically, the (stacked) autoencoder has shown its effectiveness in image denoising [32], domain adaptation [7], audio-visual speech classification [23], etc.\nAs we all known, the kernel method, such as Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis(Kernel CCA) [1], is also a widely used approach to learn nonlinear representations. Compared with the kernel method, deep learning is much more flexible and time-saving because the transform is learned rather than fixed and the time needed for training and inference process is beyond the limit of the size of training set.\nInspired by the deep learning works above, we intend to solve the cross-view classification task via deep networks. It’s natural to build one single deep neural network with samples from both views, but this kind of network can’t handle complex data from totally different modalities and\nmay suffer from inadequate representation capacity. Another way is to learn two different deep neural networks with samples of the different views. However, the two independent networks project samples from different views into different spaces, which makes comparison infeasible. Hence, building two neural networks coupled with each other seems to be a better solution.\nIn this work, we propose a Deeply Coupled Autoencoder Networks(DCAN) method that learns the common representations to conduct cross-view classification by building two neural networks deeply coupled respectively, each for one view. We build the DCAN by stacking multiple discriminative coupled auto-encoders, a denoising auto-encoder with maximum margin criterion. The discriminative coupled auto-encoder has a similar input corrupted and reconstructive error minimized mechanism with the denoising auto-encoder proposed in [28], but is modified by adding a maximum margin criterion. This kind of criterion has been used in previous works, like [21, 29, 35], etc. Note that the counterparts from two views are added into the maximum margin criterion simultaneously since they both come from the same class, which naturally couples the corresponding layer in two deep networks. A schematic illustration can be seen in Fig.1.\nThe proposed DCAN is related to Multimodal Autoencoders [23], Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis [3]. The first two methods tend to learn a single network with one or more layers connected to both views and to predict one view from the other view, and the Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis build two deep networks, each for one view, and only representations of the highest layer are constrained to be correlated. Therefore, the key difference is that we learn two deep networks coupled with each other in representations in each layer, which is of great benefits because the DCAN not only learn two separate deep encodings but also makes better use of data from the both two views. What’s more, these differences allow for our model to handle the recognition task even when data is impure and insufficient.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the formulation and solution to the proposed Deeply Coupled Auto-encoder Networks. Experimental results in Section 3 demonstrate the efficacy of the DCAN. In section 4 a conclusion is given."

      "text" : "As shown in Fig.1, the Deeply Coupled Auto-encoder Networks(DCAN) consists of two deep networks coupled with each other, and each one is for one view. The network structures of the two deep networks are just like the left-most and the right-most parts in Fig.1, where circles means the units in each layers (pixels in a input image for the input layer and hidden representation in higher layers), and arrows denote the full connections between adjacent layers. And the middle part of Fig.1 illustrates how the whole network projects samples in different views into a common space and gradually enhances the separability with increasing layers.\nThe two deep networks are both built through stacking multiple similar coupled single layer blocks because a single coupled layer might be insufficient, and the method of stacking multiple layers and training each layer greedily has be proved efficient in lots of previous works, such as those in [13, 6]. With the number of layers increased, the whole network can compactly represent a significantly larger set of transforms than shallow networks , and gradually narrow the gap with the discriminative capacity enhanced.\nWe use a discriminative coupled auto-encoders trained with maximum margin criterion as a single layer component. Concretely, we incorporate the additional noises in the training process while maximizing the margin criterion, which makes the learnt mapping more stable as well as discriminant. Note that the maximum margin criterion also works in coupling two corresponding layers. Formally, the discriminative coupled auto-encoder can be written as follows:\nmin fx,fy L(X, fx) + L(Y, fy) (1)\ns.t. G1(Hx, Hy)−G2(Hx, Hy) ≤ ε, (2)\nwhere X,Y denote inputs from the two views, and Hx, Hy denote hidden representations of the two views respectively. fx : X −→ Hx, fy : Y −→ Hy are the transforms we intend to learn, and we denote the reconstructive error as L(·), and maximum margin criterion as G1(·)−G2(·), which are described detailedly in the next subsection.ε is the threshold of the maximum margin criterion."

      "text" : "In the problem of cross-view, there are two types of heterogenous samples. Without loss of generality, we denote samples from one view as X = [x1, · · · , xn] , and those from the other view as Y = [y1, · · · , yn], in which n is the sample sizes. Noted that the corresponding labels are known, and Hx, Hy denote hidden representations of the two views we want to learn.\nThe DCAN attempts to learn two nonlinear transforms fx : X −→ Hx and fy : Y −→ Hy that can project the samples from two views to one discriminant common space respectively, in which the local neighborhood relationship as well as class separability should be well preserved for each view. The auto-encoder like structure stands out in preserving the local consistency, and the denoising form enhances the robustness of learnt representations. However, the discrimination isn’t taken into consideration. Therefore, we modify the denoising autoencoder by adding a maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty. And the best nonlinear transformation is a trade-off between local consistency preserving and separability enhancing.\nJust like the one in denoising auto-encoder, the reconstructive error L(·) in Eq.(1) is formulated as follows:\nL(X,Θ) = ∑ x∈Xp Ex̃∼P (x̃|x)‖x̂− x‖ (3)\nL(Y,Θ) = ∑ y∈Y p Eỹ∼P (ỹ|y)‖ŷ − y‖ (4)\nwhere E calculates the expectation over corrupted versions X̃, Ỹ of examples X,Y obtained from a corruption process P (x̃|x), P (ỹ|y). Θ = {Wx,Wy, bx, by, cx, cy} specifies the two nonlinear transforms fx, fy , where Wx,Wy is the weight matrix, and bx, by, cx, cy are the bias of encoder and decoder respectively, and X̂, Ŷ are calculated through the decoder process :\nX̂ = s(WTx Hx + cx) Ŷ = s(WTy Hy + cy) (5)\nAnd hidden representations Hx, Hy are obtained from the encoder that is a similar mapping with the decoder,\nHx = s(WxX̃ + bx) Hy = s(WyỸ + by) (6)\nwhere s is the nonlinear activation function, such as the point-wise hyperbolic tangent operation on linear projected features, i.e.,\ns(x) = eax − e−ax\neax + e−ax (7)\nin which a is the gain parameter. Moreover, for the maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty, the constraint term G1(·) − G2(·) in Eq.(1) is used to realize coupling since samples of the same class are treated similarly no matter which view they are from.\nAssuming S is the set of sample pairs from the same class, and D is the set of sample pairs from different classes. Note that the counterparts from two views are naturally added into S,D since it’s the class rather than the view that are considered.\nThen, we characterize the compactness as follows,\nG1(H) = 1\n2N1 ∑ Ii,Ij∈S ‖hi − hj‖2, (8)\nwhere hi denotes the corresponding hidden representation of an input Ii ∈ X ⋂ Y and is a sample from either view 1 or view 2, and N1 is the size of S. Meanwhile, the goal of the inter-class separability is to push the adjacent samples from different classes far away,\nwhich can be formulated as follows,\nG2(H) = 1\n2N2 ∑ Ii,Ij∈D\nIj∈KNN(Ii)\n‖hi − hj‖2, (9)\nwhere Ij belongs to the k nearest neighbors of Ii with different class labels, and N2 is the number of all pairs satisfying the condition.\nAnd the function of G1(H), G2(H) is illustrated in the middel part of Fig.1. In the projected common space denoted by S, the compactness term G1(·) shown by red ellipse works by pulling intra-class samples together while the penalty termG2(·) shown by black ellipse tend to push adjacent inter-class samples away.\nFinally, by solving the optimization problem Eq.(1), we can learn a couple of nonlinear transforms fx, fy to transform the original samples from both views into a common space."

      "text" : "Through the training process above, we model the map between original sample space and a preliminary discriminant subspace with gap eliminated, and build a hidden representation H which is a trade-off between approximate preservation on local consistency and the distinction of the projected data. But since real-world data is highly complicated, using a single coupled layer to model the vast and complex real scenes might be insufficient. So we choose to stack multiple such coupled network layers described in subsection 2.2. With the number of layers increased, the whole network can compactly represent a significantly larger set of transforms than shallow networks, and gradually narrow the gap with the discriminative ability enhanced.\nTraining a deep network with coupled nonlinear transforms can be achieved by the canonical greedy layer-wise approach [12, 6]. Or to be more precise, after training a single layer coupled network, one can compute a new feature H by the encoder in Eq.(6) and then feed it into the next layer network as the input feature. In practice, we find that stacking multiple such layers can gradually reduce the gap and improve the recognition performance (see Fig.1 and Section 3)."

And γ is called the weight decay parameter and is usually set to a small value, e.g., 1.0e-4.\nTo optimize the objective function (10), we use backpropagation to calculate the gradient and then employ the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method [24, 17], which is often used to solve nonlinear optimization problems without any constraints. L-BFGS is particularly suitable for problems with a large amount of variables under the moderate memory requirement. To utilize L-BFGS, we need to calculate the gradients of the object function. Obviously, the object function in (10) is differential to these parameters Θ, and we use Back-propagation [18] method to derive the derivative of the overall cost function. In our setting, we find the objective function can achieve as fast convergence as described in [17]."

We compare the proposed DCAN method with several baselines and stateof-the-art methods, including CCA [14], Kernel CCA [1], Deep CCA [3], FDA [4], CDFE [22], CSR [20], PLS [26] and MvDA [15]. The first seven methods are pairwise methods for cross-view classification. MvDA jointly learns all transforms when multiple views can be utilized, and has achieved the state-of-the-art results in their reports [15].\nThe Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [4] is used for dimension reduction. In our experiments, we set the default dimensionality as 100 with preservation of most energy except Deep CCA, PLS, CSR and CDFE, where the dimensionality are tuned in [50,1000] for the best performance. For all these methods, we report the best performance by tuning the related parameters according to their papers. Firstly, for Kernel CCA, we experiment with Gaussian kernel and polynomial kernel and adjust the parameters to get the best performance. Then for Deep CCA [3], we strictly follow their algorithms and tune all possible parameters, but the performance is inferior to CCA. One possible reason is that Deep CCA only considers the correlations on training data (as reported in their paper) so that the learnt mode overly fits the training data, which thus leads to the poor generality on the testing set. Besides, the parameter α and β are respectively traversed in [0.2,2] and [0.0001,1] for CDFE, the parameter λ and η\nare searched in [0.001,1] for CSR, and the reduced dimensionality is tuned for CCA, PLS, FDA and MvDA.\nAs for our proposed DCAN, the performance on CUFSF database of varied parameters, λ, k, is shown in Fig.3. In following experiments, we set λ = 0.2, γ = 1.0e − 4, k = 10 and a = 1. With increasing layers, the number of hidden neurons are gradually reduced by 10, i.e., 90, 80, 70, 60 if four layers."

      "text" : "First, to explicitly illustrate the learnt mapping, we conduct an experiment on Multi-PIE dataset by projecting the learnt common features into a 2-D space with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As shown in Fig.2. The classical method CCA can only roughly align the data in the principal directions and the state-of-the-art method MvDA [15] attempts to merge two types of data but seems to fail. Thus, we argue that linear transforms are a little stiff to convert data from two views into an ideal common space. The three diagrams below shows that DCAN can gradually separate samples from different classes with the increase of layers, which is just as we described in the above analysis.\nNext, we compare our methods with several state-ofthe-art methods for the cross-view face recognition task\non Multi-PIE data set. Since the images are acquired over seven poses on Multi-PIE data set, in total 7 × 6 = 42 comparison experiments need to be conducted. The detailed results are shown in Table 2,where two poses are used as the gallery and probe set to each other and the rank-1 recognition rate is reported. Further, the mean accuracy of all pairwise results for each methods is also reported in Table 1.\nFrom Table 1, we can find the supervised methods except CSR are significantly superior to CCA due to the use of the label information. And nonlinear methods except Deep CCA are significantly superior to the nonlinear methods due to the use of nonlinear transforms. Compared with FDA, the proposed DCAN with only one layer network can perform better with 1.6% improvement. With increasing layers, the accuracy of DCAN reaches a climax via stacking three layer networks. The reason of the degradation in DCAN with four layers is mainly the effect of reduced dimensionality, where 10 dimensions are cut out from the above layer network. Obvi-\nously, compared with two-view based methods, the proposed DCAN with three layers improves the performance greatly (88.4% vs. 81.4%). Besides, MvDA also achieves a considerably good performance by using all samples from all poses. It is unfair to compare these two-view based methods (containing DCAN) with MvDA, because the latter implicitly uses additional five views information except current compared two views. But our method performs better than MvDA, 88.4% vs. 86.7%. As observed in Table 2, three-layer DCAN achieves a largely improvement compared with CCA,FDA,CDFE for all cross-view cases and MvDA for most of cross-view cases. The results are shown in Table 2 and Table 1."

As shown in this table, since only two views can be utilized in this case, MvDA degrades to a comparable performance with those previous two-view based methods. Our proposed DCAN with three layer networks can achieve even better with more than 6% improvement, which further indicates DCAN benefits from the nonlinear and multi-layer structure.\nDiscussion and analysis: The above experiments demonstrate that our methods can work very well even\non a small sample size. The reasons lie in three folds:\n(1) The maximum margin criterion makes the learnt mapping more discriminative, which is a straightforward strategy in the supervised classification task.\n(2) Auto-encoder approximately preserves the local neighborhood structures. For this, Alain et al. [2] theoretically prove that the learnt representation by auto-encoder can recover local properties from the view of manifold. To further validate that, we employ the first 700 photo images from CUFSF database to perform the nonlinear self-reconstruction with auto-encoder. With the hidden presentations, we find the local neighbors with 1,2,3,4,5 neighbors can be preserved with the probability of 99.43%, 99.00%, 98.57%, 98.00% and 97.42% respectively. Thus, the use of auto-encoder intrinsically reduces the complexity of the discriminant model, which further makes the learnt model better generality on the testing set.\n(3) The deep structure generates a gradual model, which makes the learnt transform more robust. With only one layer, the model can’t represent the complex data very well. But with layers goes deeper, the coupled networks can learn transforms much more flexible and hence can be allowed to handle more complex data."

    "abstractText" : "The comparison of heterogeneous samples extensively exists in many applications, especially in the task of image classification. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective coupled neural network, called Deeply Coupled Autoencoder Networks (DCAN), which seeks to build two deep neural networks, coupled with each other in every corresponding layers. In DCAN, each deep structure is developed via stacking multiple discriminative coupled auto-encoders, a denoising auto-encoder trained with maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty. This single layer component makes our model simultaneously preserve the local consistency and enhance its discriminative capability. With increasing number of layers, the coupled networks can gradually narrow the gap between the two views. Extensive experiments on cross-view image classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.",
