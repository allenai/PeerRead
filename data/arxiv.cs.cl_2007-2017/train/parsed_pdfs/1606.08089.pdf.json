      "text" : "In the biomedical domain, an enormous amount of information about protein, gene, and drug interactions appears in the form of natural language across millions of academic papers. There is a tremendous ongoing effort (Nédellec et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2009) to extract individual chemical interactions from these texts, but these interactions are only isolated fragments of larger causal mechanisms such as protein signaling pathways. Nowhere, however, including any\ndatabase, is the complete mechanism described in a form that lends itself to causal search or inference. The absence of such a database is not for lack of trying; Pathway Commons (Cerami et al., 2011) aims to address the need, but its authors estimate it currently covers 1% of the literature due to the high cost of annotation1. This issue only grows more pressing with the yearly growth in biomedical publishing, which presents an otherwise insurmountable challenge for biomedical researchers to query and interpret.\nThe Big Mechanism program (Cohen, 2015) aims to construct exactly such large-scale mechanistic information by reading and assembling protein signaling pathways that are relevant for cancer, and exploit them to generate novel explanatory and treatment hypotheses. Although prior work (Chambers et al., 2014; Mirza, 2016) has addressed the challenging area of temporal precedence in the open domain, the biomedical domain presents very different data and, consequently, requires novel techniques. Precedence in mechanistic biology is causal rather than temporal. Though event temporality is crucial to understanding electronic health records for individual patients (Bethard et al., 2015; Bethard et al., 2016), its contribution to the understanding of biomolecular reactions is less clear as these events and processes may repeat in extremely short cycles, continue without end, or overlap in time. At any level of abstraction, causal precedence encodes mechanistic information and facilitates inference over spotty evidence. For the purpose of this work, precedence is defined for two events, A and B, as\nA precedes B if and only if the output of A is necessary for the successful execution of B.2\n1Personal communication. 2See the “precedes” examples in Table 1.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n08 08\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 Ju\nn 20\n16\nVery little annotated data exists for causal precedence, especially efforts focusing on signaling pathways. BioCause (Mihăilă et al., 2013), for instance, is centered on connections between claims and evidence and contains only 51 annotated examples of causal precedence3. Our work4 offers three contributions in aid of automatically extracting causal ordering in biomedical text. First, we provide and describe a dataset of real text examples, manually annotated for causal precedence. Second, we analyze the efficacy of a battery of different models in automatically determining precedence, built on top of the Reach automatic reading system (Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2015a; Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2015c) and measured against this novel corpus. In particular, we investigate three classes of models: (a) deterministic rule-based models inspired by the precedence sieves proposed by Chambers et al. (2014), (b) feature-based models, and (c) models that rely on latent representations such as long short-term memory (LSTM) networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Our analysis indicates that while independently the top-performing model achieves a micro F1 of 43, these models are largely complementary with a combined recall of 58 points. Lastly, we conduct an error analysis of these models to motivate and inform future research."

      "text" : "Our corpus annotates several types of relations between mentions of biochemical interactions. Following common terminology promoted by the BioNLP shared tasks, we will interchangeably use “events” to refer to these interactions. To generate candidate events for our planned annotations, we ran the Reach event extraction system (Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2015a; Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2015c) over the full text5 of 500 biomedical papers taken from the\n3These are marked in the BioCause corpus as Causality events with Cause and Effect arguments. The remaining 800 annotations are claim-evidence relations.\n4The corpus, tools, and system introduced in this work are publicly available at https://github.com/ myedibleenso/this-before-that\n5We chose to ignore the “references”, “materials”, and “methods” sections, which generally do not contain mechanistic information.\nOpen Access subset of PubMed6. The events extracted by Reach are biochemical events of two types: simple events such as phosphorylation that modify one or more entities (typically proteins), and nested events (regulations) that have other events as arguments.\nTo improve the likelihood of finding pairs of events with a relevant link, we filtered event pairs by imposing the following requirements for inclusion in the corpus:\n1. Event pairs must share at least one participant. This constraint is based on the observation that interactions that share participants are more likely to be connected.\n2. Event pairs must be within 1 sentence of each other. Similarly, discourse proximity increases the likelihood of two events being related.\n3. Event pairs must not share the same type. This helps to maximize the diversity of the dataset.\n4. Event pairs must not already be contained in an extracted Regulation event. For example, we did not annotate the relation between the binding and the phosphorylation events in “The binding of X and Y is inhibited\n6http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/ tools/openftlist/\nby X phosphorylation”, because it is already captured by most state-of-the-art biomedical event extraction systems.\nAfter applying these constraints, only 1700 event pairs remained. In order to rapidly annotate the event pairs, we developed a browser-based annotation UI that is completely client-side (see Figure 3). Using this tool, we annotated 1000 event pairs for this work; 84 of these were discarded due to severe extraction errors. The annotations include the event spans, event triggers (i.e., the verbal or nominal predicates that indicate the type of interaction such as “binding” or “phosphorylated”), source document, minimal sentential span encompassing both event mentions, and whether or not the event pair involves coreference for either the event trigger or the event participants. For events requiring coreference resolution, we expanded the encompassing span of text to also capture the antecedent. Note that domain-specific coreference resolution is a component of the event extraction system used here (Bell et al., 2016).\nWhen describing the relations between these event pairs, we refer to the event that occurs first in text as Event 1 (E1) and the event that follows as Event 2 (E2). Each (E1, E2) pair was assigned one of seven labels: “E1 precedes E2”, “E2 precedes E1”, “Equivalent”, “E1 specifies E2”, “E2 specifies E1”, “Other”, or “None”. Table 1 provides examples for each of these labels. We converged on these labels because they are fundamental to the assembly of causal mechanisms from a collection of events. Collectively, the seven labels address three important assembly tasks: equivalence, i.e., understanding that two event mentions discuss the same event, subsumption, i.e., the two mentions discuss the same event, but one is more specific than the other, and, most importantly, causal precedence, the identification of which is the focus of this work. During the annotation process, we came across examples of other relevant phenomena. We grouped these instances under the label “Other” and leave their analysis for future work.\nThough simplified, the examples in Table 3 illustrate that this is a complex task sensitive to linguistic evidence. For example, the direction of the precedence relations in the first two rows in the table changes based on a single word in the context (“prior” vs. “following”).\nIn terms of the distribution of relations, causal\nprecedence pairs appear more frequently within the same sentence, while cases of the subsumption (“specifies”) and equivalence relations are far more common across sentences (see Figure 1). Coreference is involved in 10–15% of the instances for each relation label (see Figure 2).\nThe annotation process was performed by two linguists familiar with the biomedical domain. To minimize errors, the annotation task was initially performed together at the same workstation.7 On a randomly selected sample of 100 event pairs, the two annotators had a Cohen’s kappa score (Cohen, 1960) of 0.82, indicating “almost perfect” agreement for the precedes labels (Landis and Koch, 1977)."

      "heading" : "3.1 Deterministic Models",
      "text" : "The deterministic models are defined by a small number of hand-written rules using the Odin event extraction framework (Valenzuela-Escárcega et al., 2015b). The number of rules for each model is shown in Table 2, and sharply contrast with the 92,711 features introduced later (Table 3) that are used by our machine-learning models. In order to avoid overfitting, all of the deterministic models were created without reference to the annotation corpus, using general linguistic expertise and domain knowledge.\nIntra-sentence ordering Within sentences, syntactic regularities can be exploited to cover a large variety of grammatical constructions indicating precedence relations. Rules defined over dependency parses (De Marneffe and Manning, 2008) capture precedence in sentences like those in (1) and (2) as well as many others.\n(1) [The RBD of PI3KC2B binds HRAS]after , when [HRAS is not bound to GTP]before\n(2) [The ubiquitination of A]before is followed by [the phosphorylation of B]after\nOther phrases captured include: “precedes”, “due to”, “leads to”, “results in”, etc.\nInter-sentence ordering Although syntax operates over single sentences, cross-sentence time expressions can indicate ordering, as shown in Examples (3) and (4). We exploit these regularities as well by checking for sentence-initial word combinations.\n(3) [A is phosphorylated by B]before. As a downstream effect, [C is . . . ]after\n(4) [A is phosphorylated by B]before. [C is then . . . ]after\nOther phrases captured include: “Later”, “In response”, “For this”, and “Ultimately”.\nVerbal tense- and aspect-based (Reichenbach) ordering Following Chambers et al. (2014), we use deterministic rules to establish precedence between events that have certain verbal tense and aspect. These rules are derived from linguistic analysis of tense and aspect by (Reichenbach, 1947; Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2013). Example (5) illustrates a case in which we can accurately infer order just from this information. Because has been phosphorylated has past tense and perfective\naspect, this model concludes that it precedes share (present tense, simple aspect) and thus the binding of histone H2A.\n(5) These [PTIP] proteins also share the ability to bind histone H2A (or H2AX in mammals) that has been phosphorylated. . . .\nThe logic determining which tense-aspect combinations receive which precedence relations is identical to CAEVO, which is possible because it is open source8. However, CAEVO operates over annotations that include gold tense and aspect values, whereas this model additionally detects tense and aspect using Odin rules before applying this logic."

      "heading" : "3.2 Feature-based Models",
      "text" : "Most instances of causal precedence cannot be captured with deterministic rules, because they lack explicit words, phrases, or syntactic structures that unambiguously mark the relation. Using a combination of the surface, syntactic, and taxonomic features outlined in Table 3, we trained a set of statistical classifiers to detect causal precedence relations between pairs of events in our corpus. For training and testing purposes, we treated any instance not labeled as either “E1 precedes E2” or “E2 precedes E1” as a negative example. We examined the following statistical models: a linear kernel SVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), logistic regression (Fan et al., 2008), and random forest9 (Surdeanu et al., 2014). For the SVM and logistic regression (LR) models, we also compared the effects of L1 and L2 regularization."

      "heading" : "3.3 Latent Representation Models",
      "text" : "Due to the complexity of the task and variety of causal precedence instances encountered during the annotation process, it is unclear whether a linear combination of engineered features is sufficient for broad coverage classification. For this reason, we introduce a latent feature representation model using an LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Bergstra et al., 2010; Chollet, 2015) to capture underlying semantic features by incorporating long-distance contextual information and selectively persisting memory of previous event pairs to aid in classification.\n8https://github.com/nchambers/caevo 9Abbreviated as RF\nThe basic architecture is shown in Figure 5. The input to this model is the provenance of the relation, i.e., the whole text containing the two events and the text in between. Formally, this is represented as a concatenated sequence of 200 dimensional vectors where each vector in the sequence corresponds to a token in the minimal sentential span encompassing the event pair being classified. Intuitively, this LSTM “reads” the text from left to right and outputs a classification label from the set of three when done. We consider two variations of this model: the basic model (LSTM) with the vector weights for each token uninitialized and a second form (LSTM+P) where the vectors are initialized using pre-training. In the pretraining configuration, the vector weights are initialized using word embeddings generated by a word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013; Řehůřek and Sojka, 2010) model trained on the full text of over 1 million biomedical papers taken from the Open Access subset of PubMed. Because the corpus is only 1000 annotations, it was thought that pretraining could improve prediction of causal precedence and guide the model with distributional semantic representations specific to this domain.\nBuilding on this simple blueprint, we designed a three-pronged “pitchfork” (FLSTM) where the span of E1, the span of E2, and the minimal sentential span encompassing E1 and E2 each serve as a separate input, allowing the model to explicitly address each of them as well as discover how these three inputs relate to one another. This architecture is shown in Figure 6. Each input feeds into its own LSTM and corresponding dropout layer before the three forks are merged via a concatenation of tensors. Like the basic model, one version of the “pitchfork” is trained with vector weights initialized using the pre-trained word embeddings (FLSTM+P)."

Figure 7 illustrates that as sieves are added, the F1 score remains fairly constant, while recall increases at the cost of precision.\nDespite some obvious patterns noted in Table 1, the deterministic models perform the worst due in large part to their rarity in the corpus. An analysis of this result is given in Section 5. Overall, our top-performing model was the linear kernel SVM with L1 regularization. In all cases, the feature-based classifiers outperform the latent feature representations, suggesting that in cases such as this where little data is available, feature-based classifiers capitalizing on high-level linguistic features are able to better generalize and thus outperform latent feature models. However, as our discussion in Section 5.1 will show, our combined model demonstrates that the latent and featurebased models are largely complementary."

An analysis of the Reichenbach model reveals one source of this low coverage. In short, although writers could describe causal mechanisms using temporal indicators such as tense and aspect, temporal description is rare enough in this domain not to be represented in our randomly sampled database. Table 5 illustrates the lack of overlap with informative tense-aspect combinations; a single tense is used per passage, and no perfective aspect is used.\nSimilarly, the time expressions required by the deterministic intra- and inter-sentence precedence rules are rare enough to make them ineffective on this sample."

First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and latent representation models. The highestperforming individual model achieved a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler temporalonly precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.",
