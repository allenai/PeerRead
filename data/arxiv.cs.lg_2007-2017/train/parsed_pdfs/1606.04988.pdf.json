      "text" : "Can we effectively predict one of K classes in deeply sublinear time? This question gives rise to the area of extreme multiclass classification [1, 3, 4, 7, 17, 19, 25], in whichK is very large. An attractive strategy for picking one of K items efficiently is to use a tree; unfortunately, this often comes at the cost of increased error. If efficiency isn’t a concern, the most common and generally effective representation for multiclass prediction is a one-against-all (OAA) structure. Here, inference consists of computing a score for each class and returning the class with the maximum score.\nA general replacement for the one-against-all approach must satisfying a difficult set of desiderata.\n• High accuracy: The approach should provide accuracy competitive with OAA, a remarkably strong baseline[20] which is the standard “output layer” of many learning systems such as recent winners of the imagenet contest [11, 22]. • High speed at training time and test time: A multiclass classifier must spend at least θ(logK) time [7]) so this is a natural benchmark to optimize against. • Online operation. Many learning algorithms use either online updates or mini-batch updates. Approaches satisfying this constraint can be easily composed into an end-to-end learning system for solving complex problems like image recognition. Online approaches also easily compose with batch learning algorithms such as traditional decision tree learning. • Linear space: In order to have a drop-in replacement for OAA, an approach must not take much more space than OAA. Memory is at a premium when K is very large, especially for models trained on GPUs, or deployed to small devices.\nWe use an OAA-like structure to make a final prediction, but instead of scoring every class, we only score a small subset of O(logK) classes. We call this “one-against-some” (OAS). How can you efficiently determine what classes should be scored? We use a dynamically built tree to efficiently\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 98\n8v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n1 5\nInput: Example x; Root Node n Result: Predicted class ŷ do\nr← n.f(x) > 0 ? n.left : n.right if ̂recall(n) > ̂recall(r) then\nbreak end n← r x← x ∪ {(n : 1)}\nwhile n.leaf is false ŷ ← argmax\ny∈n.candidates Predicty(x)\n\uD835\uDC65\n{1, 4, 7, … }\n…\n{\uD835\uDC601, \uD835\uDC604, \uD835\uDC607, … }\n\uD835\uDC66 = \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC58\n{1, 4, 7, … }\n\uD835\uDC65\n\uD835\uDC65\n\uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65; 0)\n\uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65; 1) \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65; 2)\nFigure 1: Left: Pseudocode for prediction where n.f(x) evaluates the node’s route, ̂recall() is a recall bound, and x ∪ {(n : 1)} indicates the addition of a sparse feature with index n and value 1.

The goal of the tree is to maximize the recall of the candidate set so we call this approach “The Recall Tree.”\nFigure 1 depicts the inference procedure for the Recall Tree: an example is routed through a tree until termination, and then the set of eligible classes compete to predict the label. We use this inference procedure at training time, to facilitate end-to-end joint optimization of the predictors at each internal node in the tree (the “routers”), the tree structure, and the final OAS predictors.\nThe Recall Tree achieves good accuracy, always improving on previous online approaches [7] and sometimes surpassing the OAA baseline. The training algorithm requires only poly(logK) time during training and testing. In practice, the computational benefits are substantial when K ≥ 1000.1 The Recall Tree constructs a tree and learns parameters in a fully online manner as a reduction allowing composition with systems trained via online updates. All of this requires only a factor of 2 more space than OAA approaches.\nOur contributions are the following:\n• We propose a new online tree construction algorithm which jointly optimizes the construction of the tree, the routers and the underlying OAS predictors (see section 3.2). • We analyze elements of the algorithm, including a new boosting bound (see section 3.1) on multiclass classification performance and a representational trick which allows the algorithm to perform well if either a tree representation does well or a OAA representation does well as discussed in section 3.3. • We experiment with the new algorithm, both to analyze its performance relative to baselines and understand the impact of design decisions via ablation experiments.\nThe net effect is a theoretically motivated algorithm which empirically performs well providing a plausible replacement for the standard one-against-all approach in the large K setting."

Despite working with radically less space we show the Recall Tree provides better predictive performance.\nOther approaches such as hierarchical softmax (HSM) and the the Filter Tree [3] use a fixed tree structure [17]. In domains in which there is no prespecified tree hierarchy, using a random tree structure can lead to considerable underperformance as shown previously [1, 7].\nMost other approaches in extreme classification either do not work online [16, 19] or only focus on speeding up either prediction time or training time but not both.

In [16] the authors try to add tree structure learning to HSM via iteratively clustering the classes. While the end result is a classifier whose inference time scales logarithmically with the number of classes, the clustering steps are batch and scale poorly with the number of classes. Similar remarks apply to [1] where the authors propose to learn a tree by solving an eigenvalue problem after (OAA) training. The work of [25] is similar in spirit to ours, as the authors propose to learn a label filter to reduce the number of candidate classes in an OAA approach. However they learn the tree after training the underlying OAA predictors while in this work we learn and, more crucially, use the tree during training of the OAS predictors. Among the approaches that speed up training time we distinguish exact ones [8, 23] that have only been proposed for particular loss functions and approximate ones such as negative sampling as used e.g. in [24]. Though these techniques do not address inference time, separate procedures for speeding up inference (given a trained model) have been proposed [21]. However, such two step procedures can lead to substantially suboptimal results."

      "heading" : "2 The Recall Tree Algorithm",
      "text" : "Here we present a concrete description of the Recall Tree and defer all theoretical results that motivate our decisions to the next section. The Recall Tree maintains one predictor for each class and a tree whose purpose is to eliminate predictors from consideration. We refer to the per-class predictors as one-against-some (OAS) predictors. The tree to create a high recall set of candidate classes and then leverages the OAS predictors to achieve precision. Crucially, the leaves of the tree do not partition the set of classes: classes can (and do) have support at multiple leaves.\nFigure 2 outlines the learning procedures, which we now describe in more detail. Each node in the tree maintains a set of statistics. First, each node n maintains a router, denoted n.f , that maps an example to either a left or right child. This router is implemented as a binary classifier. Second, each node maintains a histogram of the labels of all training examples that have been routed to, or through, that node. This histogram is used in two ways: (1) the most frequent classes form the competitor set for the OAS predictors; (2) the histogram is used to decide whether the statistics at each node can be trusted. This is a crucial issue with trees because a child node sees fewer data than its parent. Therefore we do not simply rely on the empirical recall (i.e. the observed fraction of labels that fall into the most frequent F labels at this node) of a node since such estimate can have considerable variance at deep nodes. Instead, we use a lower bound of the true recall which we compute via an empirical Bernstein inequality (see Section 3.2).\nLearning the predictors for each class In Figure 2a update predictors updates the candidate set predictors using the standard OAA strategy restricted to the set of eligible classes. If the true label is not in the F most frequent classes at this node then no update occurs.\nLearning the set of candidates in each node In Figure 2a update candidates updates the count of the true label at this node. At each node, the most frequent F labels are the candidate set.\nLearning the routers at each node In Figure 2b update router updates the router at a node by optimizing the decrease in the entropy of the label distribution (the label entropy) due to routing. This is in accordance with our theory (Section 3.1). The label entropy for a node is estimated using the empirical counts of each class label entering the node. These counts are reliable as update router is only called for the root or nodes whose true recall bound is better than their children. The expected label entropy after routing is estimated by averaging the estimated label entropy of each child node, weighted by the fraction of examples routing left or right. Finally, we compute the advantage of routing left vs. right by taking the difference of the expected label entropies for routing left vs. right. The sign of this difference determines the binary label for updating the router.\nTree depth control Although we limit the maximum depth d of the tree, this parameter is typically not operative. Instead, we calculate a lower bound ̂recall(n) on the true recall of node n (Section 3.2), halting descent as in Figure 2a. As we descend the tree, the bound first increases (empirical recall increases) then declines (variance increases)."

      "heading" : "3 Theoretical Motivation",
      "text" : "Online construction of an optimal logarithmic time predictor for multiclass classification given an arbitrary fixed representation at each node appears deeply intractable. A main difficulty is that decisions have to be hard because we cannot afford to maintain a distribution over all class labels. Choosing a classifier so as to minimize error rate is not just NP-hard, it is so difficult it has been considered for cryptographic primitives [5]. Furthermore, the joint optimization of all predictors does not nicely decompose into independent problems. Solving the above problems requires an implausible break-through in complexity theory which we do not achieve here. Instead, we use learning theory to assist the design by analyzing various simplifications of the problem."

      "heading" : "3.1 Optimization Objective",
      "text" : "Shannon Entropy of class labels is optimized in the router of figure 2b. Why?\nSince the Recall Tree jointly optimizes over many base learning algorithms, the systemic properties of the joint optimization are important to consider. A theory of decision tree learning as boosting [12] provides a way to understand these joint properties in a population limit (or equivalently on a training set iterated until convergence). In essence, the analysis shows that each level of the decision tree boosts the accuracy of the resulting tree with this conclusion holding for several common objectives.\nFor multiclass classification, it is important to achieve a weak dependence on the number of class labels. Shannon Entropy is particularly well-suited to this goal, because it has only a logarithmic dependence on the number of class labels. Let πi|n be the probability that the correct label is i, conditioned on the corresponding example reaching node n. Then Hn = − ∑K i=1 πi|n log2 πi|n is the Shannon entropy of class labels reaching node n.\nFor this section, we consider a simplified algorithm which neglects concerns of finite sample analysis, how optimization is done, and the leaf predictors. What’s left is the value of optimizing the router objective. We consider an algorithm which recursively splits the leaf with the largest fraction f of all examples starting at the root and reaching the leaf. The leaf is split into two new leaves to the left l and right r. If fl and fr are the fraction of examples going left and right, the split criterion minimizes the expectation over the leaves of the average class entropy, flHl + frHr. This might be achieved by update router in Figure 2a or by any other means. With this criterion and the next assumption tree learning is effective. Definition 1. (γ-Weak Learning Assumption) For all distributions D(x, y) a learning algorithm using examples (x, y)∗ IID from D finds a binary classifier c : X → {−1, 1} satisfying\nPr (x,y)∼D (c(x) 6= y) ≤ 1 2 − γ .\nAs long as Weak Learning occurs, we can prove the following theorem. Theorem 2. If γ Weak Learning holds for every node in the tree and nodes with the largest fraction of examples are split first, then after t splits the multiclass error rate of the tree is bounded by:\n≤ √ H1 exp [ − γ\n2 blog2 tc 16 dlog2Ke ] where H1 is the entropy of the marginal distribution of class labels.\nThe proof in appendix A reuses techniques from [7, 12].\nThe most important observation from the theorem is that as t (the number of splits) increases, the error rate is increasingly bounded. This rate depends on log2 t agreeing with the intuition that boosting happens level by level in the tree. A careful examination of the proof shows that log2K is an upper bound on the entropy at internal nodes, implying the reality may be somewhat better than the theory suggests. The dependence on the initial entropy H1 shows that skewed marginal class distributions are inherently easier to learn than uniform marginal class distributions, as might be expected. These results are similar to previous results [7, 12] with two advantages. We handle multiclass rather than binary classification [12] and we bound error rates instead of entropy [7]."

      "text" : "For binary classification, branching programs [14] result in exponentially more succinct representations than decision trees [12] by joining nodes into a directed acyclic graphs. The key observation is that nodes in the same level with a similar distribution over class labels can be joined into one node, implying that the number of nodes at one level is only θ(1/γ) where γ is the weak learning parameter rather than exponential in the depth. This approach generally fails in the multiclass setting because covering the simplex of multiclass label distributions requires (K − 1)θ(1/γ) nodes. One easy special case exists. When the distribution over class labels is skewed so one label is the majority class, learning a minimum entropy classifier is equivalent to predicting whether the class is the majority or not. There are only K possible OAS predictors of this sort so maintaining one for each class label is computationally tractable.\nUsing OAS classifiers creates a limited branching program structure over predictions. Aside from the space savings generated, this also implies that nodes deep in the tree use many more labeled examples than are otherwise available. In finite sample regimes, which are not covered by these boosting analyses, having more labeled samples implies a higher quality predictor as per standard sample complexity analysis.\nA fundamental issue with a tree-structured prediction is that the number of labeled examples incident on the root is much larger than the number of labeled examples incident on a leaf. This potentially leads to: (1) underfitting toward the leaves; and (2) insufficient representation complexity toward the root. Optimizing recall, rather than accuracy, ameliorates this drawback. Instead of halting at a leaf, we can halt at an internal node n for which the top F most frequent labels contain the true answer with a sufficiently high probability. When F = O(logK) this does not compromise the goal of achieving logarithmic time classification.\nNevertheless, as data gets divided down the branches of the tree, empirical estimates for the “top F most frequent labels” suffer from a substantial missing mass problem [10]. Thus, instead of computing empirical recall to determine when to halt descent, we use an empirical Bernstein (lower) bound [15], which is summarized by the following proposition. Proposition 1. For all learning problems D and all nodes n in a fixed tree there exists a constant λ > 0 such that with probability 1− δ\nrn ≥ r̂n −\n√ λr̂n(1− r̂n)\nmn − λ mn\n(1)\nwhere r̂n is the empirical frequency amongst mn events that the true label is in the top F labels and rn is the expected value in the population limit.\nReducing the depth of the tree by using a bound on rn and joining labeled examples from many leaves in a one-against-some approach both relieves data sparsity problems and allows greater tolerance of errors by the root node."

      "text" : "The relative representational power of different solutions is an important consideration. Are OAA types of representations inherently more or less powerful than a tree based representation? Figure 3 shows two learning problems illustrating two extremes under the assumption of a linear representation. On the left is a learning problem for which OAA is ideal while a tree representation requires at least 3 nodes. Conversely, the right image shows a distribution easily solved by a decision tree yet not solved by OAA predictors.\nBased on this, neither tree-based nor OAA style prediction is inherently more powerful, with the best solution being problem dependent.\nSince we are interested in starting with a tree-based approach and ending with a OAS classifier there is a simple representational trick which provides the best of both worlds. We can add features which record the path through the tree. To be precise, let T be a tree and pathT (x) be a vector with one dimension per node in T which is set to 1 if x traverses the node and 0 otherwise. The following proposition holds. Proposition. For any learning problem D for which a tree T achieves error rate , OAA(x, pathT (x)) with a linear representation can achieve error rate .\nLinear representations are special, because they are tractably analyzed and because they are the fundamental building blocks around which many more complex representations are built. Hence, this representational change eases prediction in many common settings.\nProof. A linear OAA classifier is defined by a matrix wiy where i ranges over the input and y ranges over the labels. Let wiy = 0 by default and 1 when i corresponds to a leaf for which the tree predicts y. Under this representation, the prediction of OAA(x, pathT (x)) is identical to T (x), and hence achieves the same error rate."

Details regarding the experimental methodology are in Appendix C. Results are summarized in Figure 4.\nComparison with LOMTree The Recall Tree typically provides superior statistical performance to LOMTree despite being restricted to use a factor of 32 less state. This typically comes with an additional computational cost since the Recall Tree must evaluate a number of per-class predictors.\nComparison with OAA While it is possible for Recall Tree to surpass OAA, typically there is a gap in statistical performance. Computationally OAA has favorable constant factors since it is highly amenable to vectorization. Conversely, the conditional execution pattern of the Recall Tree frustrates vectorization even with example mini-batching. Thus on ALOI although Recall Tree does on average 50 hyperplane evaluations per example while OAA does 1000, OAA is actually faster: larger numbers of classes are required to experience the asymptotic benefits. For ODP with circa 105 classes, with negative gradient subsampling and using 24 cores in parallel, OAA is about the same wall clock time to train as Recall Tree on a single core.2 Negative gradient sampling does not improve inference times, which are roughly 300 times slower for OAA than Recall Tree on ODP.\n2While not yet implemented, Recall Tree can presumably also leverage multicore for acceleration.\n70 75 80 85 90 95\n100\n10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08\nAv er\nag e\nCu m\nul at\niv e\nPr og\nre ss\niv e\nAc cu\nra cy\n(% )\nExamples\nin-order permuted\n(a) When the LTCB dataset is presented in the original order, Recall Tree is able to exploit sequential correlations for improved performance.

As the candidate set size is increased, test error decreases, but with diminishing returns.

Furthermore, all algorithms are implemented in the Vowpal Wabbit toolkit and therefore share file formats, parser, and binary classification base learner implying differences are attributable to the different reductions. Our baseline OAA implementation is mature and highly tuned: it always exploits vectorization, and furthermore can optionally utilize multicore training and negative gradient subsampling to accelerate training. For the larger datasets these latter features were necessary to complete the experiments: estimated unaccelerated training times are given, along with wall clock times in parenthesis."
