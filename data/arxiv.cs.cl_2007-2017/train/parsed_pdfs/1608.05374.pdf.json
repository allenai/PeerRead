      "text" : "Though a large number of Indian languages have indigenous scripts, the lack of a standardized keyboard, and the ubiquity of QWERTY keyboards, means that people most often write using ASCII1 [1] text using spellings motivated largely by pronunciation [2]. Increasingly, many technologies such as Web search and natural language processing are adapting to this phenomenon [3, 4, 5]. In the area of Speech Synthesis, although the efforts of the 2013, 2014 and 2015 Blizzard Challenges2 [6, 7] resulted in improvements to the naturalness of speech synthesis of Indian languages, the text was assumed to be written in native script. In this work, we transliterate Blizzard data to informal chat-style ASCII text using Mechanical Turkers, and synthesize speech from the resulting transliterated ASCII text. This represents a more realistic use case than in the Blizzard Challenge.\nSynthesizing speech from ASCII text is challenging: Since there is no standard way to spell pronunciations, people often spell same word in multiple ways, e.g., the word start in Telugu can be ASCII spelled prarhambham, prarambham, prarambam, praranbam, etc. whilst words that differ in both pronunciation\n1The ASCII character set is the union of Roman alphabets, digits, and a few punctuation marks.\n2http://www.synsig.org/index.php/Blizzard_ Challenge\nand meaning might be spelled the same, e.g., the words ledhu and ledu in Telugu could both be spelled ledu.\nWe address these problems by first converting ASCII graphemes to phonemes, followed by a DNN to synthesise the speech. We propose three methods for converting graphemes to phonemes. The first model is a naive model which assumes that every grapheme corresponds to a phoneme. In the second model, we enhance the naive model by treating frequently cooccurring character bi-grams as additional phonemes. In the final model, we learn a Grapheme-to-Phoneme transducer from parallel ASCII text and gold-standard phonetic transcriptions. The contributions of this paper are:\n• to synthesize speech from ASCII transliterated text for Indian languages, which to our knowledge is the first such attempt. Our results show that our Graphemeto-Phoneme conversion model combined with a DNN acoustic model performs competitively with state-of-theart speech synthesizers that use native script text.\n• the release of parallel ASCII transliterations of Blizzard data to foster research in this area."

      "text" : "Many standard transliteration systems exist for Indian languages. Table 1 shows different transliterations for an example sentence. Among these, CPS (Common Phone Set) [8] and IT3 [9] are widely used by the speech technology community, ITRANS3 [10] is used in publishing houses, and WX4 [11] by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Though these scripts provide umambiguous conversion to native Indian scripts, due to their lack of readability, and the overhead in learning how to use them, people still spell their words motivated by pronunciation. One such transliteration is shown in the row Informal of Table 1.\nThe most common trend observed in the literature is to treat transliteration as a machine translation and discriminative ranking problem [12]. Our work aims to exploit the fact that transliterations are phonetically motivated, and therefore treat transliteration as a conversion problem. Specifically, we convert informal transliterations to phonetic script, and then synthesize speech from the phonetic script using a DNN."

These approaches are able to learn from noisy input representations where there is no standard orthography.

      "heading" : "3.1.3. Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) Model",
      "text" : "In this model, we assume the phoneme-set is given. We use the common phone set (CPS, [8]) to work with the languages of interest. We convert the native text to CPS phonetic text using deterministic converters [9, 23]. We then align the phonetic transcriptions to the ASCII transliterations from Mechanical Turkers to create a pronunciation table. Table 2 shows the parallel data with the native text in the first column, the informal ASCII transliteration in the second column, and the CPS phonetic transcription in the third column.\nGiven the pronunciation lexicon, we train a G2P transducer [24] for each language separately with varying n-gram sequences. The corpus used for training is described in Section 4.1. Figure 1 displays the phone error rate of the G2P model with varying n-grams. The 6-gram model achieved the lowest phone error rate across the three languages. Telugu and Tamil achieved lower phonetic error rates compared to Hindi. This can be attributed to the ineffective handling of intricate schwa deletion, a well-known phenomenon in Indo-Aryan languages.\nAn advantage with this model is that, since the phonemeset is standard, we can train G2P and DNN on two independent datasets – G2P on parallel transliterations of a very large corpus that could be obtained via crowdsourcing, and DNN model on gold phonetic speech transcriptions independently of the G2P model’s performance. We leave this aspect of our work for future. In this work, we train a DNN model on the output of G2P aligned with natural speech."

      "heading" : "3.2. DNN Speech Synthesizer",
      "text" : "We use a DNN for learning to synthesize speech from the phonetic strings obtained in the previous step. We use two independent DNNs – one for duration and the other for acoustic modeling.\nLet xi = [xi(1), ..., xi(dx)]T and yi = [yi(1), ..., yi(dy)]T be static input and output feature vectors of the DNN, where dx and dy denote the dimensions of xi and yi, respectively, and T denotes transposition.\nDuration Model: For duration modeling, the input comprises binary features (xp) derived from a subset of the questions used by the decision-tree clustering in the standard HTS synthesiser. Similar to [20, 21], frame-aligned data for DNN training is created by forced alignment using the HMM system. The output is an eight-dimensional vector (yp) of durations for every phone, comprising five sub-state durations, the overall phone duration, syllable duration and whole word duration. We use this form of multi-task learning to improve the model; the three additional features (phone, syllable, and word durations) act as a secondary task to help the network learn more about suprasegmental variations in duration at word level. At synthesis time, these features are predicted, but ignored.\nAcoustic Model: The input uses the same features as duration prediction, to which 9 numerical features are appended. These capture frame position in the HMM state and phoneme, state position in phoneme, and state and phoneme duration. The DNN outputs comprise MCCs, BAPs and continuous logf0 (all with deltas and delta-deltas) plus a voiced/unvoiced binary value.\nIn both acoustic and duration model, all the input features are normalized to the range of [0.01, 0.99] and output features are normalized to zero mean and unit variance. The DNNs are then trained to map the linguistic features of input text to duration and acoustic features respectively. If D(xi) denotes the DNN mapping of xi, then the error of the mapping is given by:\n= ∑ ||yi −D(xi)||2 (1)\nD(xi) = d̃(zn+1) (2)\nzn+1 = d(w (n)d(zn)) (3)\nd(ϑ) = a tanh(bϑ), d̃(ϑ) = ϑ (4)\nwhere n indexes layer and w(n) is the weight matrix of the nth layer of the DNN model. At synthesis time, duration is predicted first, and is used as an input to the acoustic model to predict the speech parameters. Maximum likelihood parameter generation (MLPG) using pre-computed variances from the training data is applied to the output features for synthesis, and spectral enhancement postfiltering is applied to the resulting MCC trajectories. Finally, the STRAIGHT vocoder [25] is used to synthesize the waveform."

A possible explanation for this is that G2P uses superior phone set defined manually whereas UGM and MGM use unsupervised phones. Nevertheless, the proposed systems are not too far from the benchmark.\nCompared to Telugu, Hindi and Tamil show worse objective scores. For these two languages, punctuation marks were not retained in the corpus, which made pauses harder to predict. As a consequence, occasional pauses in the acoustics were frequently forced-aligned to non-pause phones, introducing errors in the reference durations. These unpredictable elongations inflated the objective measures, without perturbing the actual predictions too much. (Telugu, in contrast, used oracle pauses, inserted using Festvox’s ehmm based on the acoustics.)"

The error value was calculated on a linear scale instead of log-scale which was used to model the F0 values.\n• V/UV: to measure voiced/unvoiced error. In all these metrics, a lower value gives the better performance. While the objective metrics do not map directly to perceptual quality, they are often useful for system tuning.

      "text" : "Three MUSHRA (MUltiple Stimuli with Hidden Reference and Anchor)5 [26] tests were conducted to assess the naturalness of the synthesized speech. For each language, 16 native listeners were exposed to 20 sentences, chosen randomly from the test set. For each sentence, 5 unlabelled stimuli were presented in parallel: one for each of the four synthesis systems speaking that sentence plus copy-synthesis speech (i.e., vocoded speech, labelled as VOC) used as the hidden reference. Listeners were asked to rate each stimulus from 0 (extremely bad for naturalness) to 100 (same naturalness as the reference speech), and also instructed to give exactly one of the 5 stimuli in every set a rating of 100.\nFor Telugu and Hindi, we had access to a trusted pool of native speakers from IIIT-Hyderabad, while for Tamil we recruited paid workers via Amazon Mechanical Turk as listeners. The Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) from the tests are presented in Figure 2 with their standard deviation represented in log-scale. The benchmark model achieves a higher MOS in Telugu and Hindi, as expected, while in Tamil the Uni-Grapheme model\n5https://github.com/HSU-ANT/beaqlejs\nachieves best performance. However, according to paired t-tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the difference with next best system is significant only in Telugu and Hindi. Among the proposed approaches, G2P performed significantly better than other two in Telugu and Hindi. However in Tamil, both G2P and benchmark performed worse than the rest. This strange behaviour can be attributed to two reasons: 1) the absence of a mechanism for detecting outliers in turker judgements (as opposed to the use of trusted pool of listeners for Hindi and Telugu); 2) the lack of our expertize in enhancing letter to sound rules specific to Tamil. The difference in ratings suggest that some additional rules or fine-tuning of lexicon may be required for Tamil.\nThe MUSHRA scores combined across all three languages for each system are presented in Fig. 3. For further analysis, each set of fifteen parallel listener scores was converted to ranks from 1 (worst) to 5 (best), with tied ranks set to the mean of the tied position. A box plot of these rank scores aggregated across all sentences and listeners is shown in Figure 4. Listener pref-\nerences between systems are also illustrated in Figure 5. All these figures indicate, G2P performed the best among the proposed approaches.\nAn interesting issue is that some test sentences include English-language words (e.g.: road, page, congress) due to frequent code-switching among the native speakers (also reflected in the text corpus). This affected the performance of G2P conversion for those sentences, in turn creating a marginal difference between G2P and benchmark over the listening test. G2P trained on large corpora of parallel text may remove such errors in the future, thereby improving the synthesis quality and reducing the gap towards the benchmark. [27] is one such recent attempt for synthesizing speech from code-mixed text.\nNo intelligibility evaluation was conducted since transcription word error rate (WER) has been found to be a poor metric for Indian languages, cf. [6]. However, we believe listeners do take into account intelligibility while rating the stimuli, even though they were asked to rate the naturalness."

    "abstractText" : "Text-to-Speech synthesis in Indian languages has a seen lot of progress over the decade partly due to the annual Blizzard challenges. These systems assume the text to be written in Devanagari or Dravidian scripts which are nearly phonemic orthography scripts. However, the most common form of computer interaction among Indians is ASCII written transliterated text. Such text is generally noisy with many variations in spelling for the same word. In this paper we evaluate three approaches to synthesize speech from such noisy ASCII text: a naive UniGrapheme approach, a Multi-Grapheme approach, and a supervised Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) approach. These methods first convert the ASCII text to a phonetic script, and then learn a Deep Neural Network to synthesize speech from that. We train and test our models on Blizzard Challenge datasets that were transliterated to ASCII using crowdsourcing. Our experiments on Hindi, Tamil and Telugu demonstrate that our models generate speech of competetive quality from ASCII text compared to the speech synthesized from the native scripts. All the accompanying transliterated datasets are released for public access.",
