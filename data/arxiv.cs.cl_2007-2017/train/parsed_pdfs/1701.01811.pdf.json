      "text" : "Sentiment analysis deals with the assessment of opinions, speculations, and emotions in text (Zhang et al., 2012; Pang and Lee, 2008). It is a relatively recent research area that has attracted great interest as demonstrated by a series of shared evaluation tasks, e.g., analysis of tweets (Nakov et al., 2016). In (Turney and Littman, 2002), the affective ratings of unknown words were predicted utilizing the affective ratings of a small set of words (seeds) and the semantic relatedness between the unknown and the seed words. An example of sentence-level analysis was proposed in (Malandrakis et al., 2013). Other application areas include the detection of public opinion and prediction of election results (Singhal et al., 2015), correlation of mood states and stock market indices (Bollen et al., 2011).\nRecently, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Chung et al., 2014) have been\napplied to various Natural Language Processing tasks. Tree structured neural networks, which are found in literature as Recursive Neural Networks, hold a linguistic interest due to their close relation to syntactic structures of sentences being able to capture distributed information of structure such as logical terms(Socher et al., 2012). These syntactic structures are N-ary trees which represent either the underlying structure of a sentence, known as constituency trees or the relations between words known as dependency trees.\nThis paper focuses on sentence-level sentiment classification of movie reviews using syntactic parse trees as input for the proposed networks. In order to solve the task of sentiment analysis of sentences, we work upon a variant of Recursive Neural Networks which recursively create representation following the syntactic structure. The proposed computation model exploits information from subnodes as well as parent nodes of the node under examination. This neural network is referred to as Bidirectional Recursive Network (Irsoy and Cardie, 2013). The model is further enhanced with memory units and the proposed structural attention mechanism. It is observed that different nodes of a tree structure hold information of variable saliency. Not all nodes of a tree are equally informative, so the proposed model selectively weights the contribution of each node regarding the sentence level representation using structural attention model.\nWe evaluate our approach on the sentence-level sentiment classification task using one standard movie review dataset (Socher et al., 2013). Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the art methods.\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n01 81\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nJ an\n2 01\n7"

      "text" : "Recursive GRUs (Tree-Gru) upon tree structures are an extension of the sequential GRUs that allow information to propagate through network topologies. Similar to Recursive LSTM network on tree structures (Tai et al., 2015), for every node of a tree, the Tree-GRU has gating mechanisms that modulate the flow of information inside the unit without the need of a separate memory cell. The activation hj of Tree-GRU for node j is the interpolation of the previous calculated activation hjk of its kth child out ofN total children and the candidate activation h̃j .\nhj = zj ∗ N∑ k=1 hjk + (1− zj) ∗ h̃j (1)\nwhere zj is the update function which decide the degree of update that will occur on the activation based on the input vector xj and previously calculated representation hjk :\nzj = σ(Uz ∗ xj + N∑ k=1 W iz ∗ hjk) (2)\nThe candidate activation h̃j for a node j is computed similarly to that of a Recursive Neural Network as in (Socher et al., 2011):\nh̃j = f(Uh ∗ xj + N∑ k=1 W kh ∗ (hjk ∗ rj)) (3)\nwhere rj is the reset gate which allows the network to forget effectively previous computed representations when the value is close to 0 and it is computed as follows:\nrj = σ(Ur ∗ xj + N∑ k=1 W kr ∗ hjk) (4)\nEvery part of a gated recurrent unit xj , hj , rj , zj , h̃j ∈ Rd where d is the input vector dimensionality. σ is the sigmoid function and f is the non-linear tanh function.The set of matrices W k, U ∈ Rdxd used in 2 - 4 are the trainable weight parameters which connect the kth children node representation with the jth node representation and the input vector xj ."

      "heading" : "2.1 Bidirectional TreeGRU",
      "text" : "A natural extension of Tree-Structure GRU is the addition of a bidirectional approach. TreeGRUs calculate an activation for node j with the use of previously computed activations lying lower in the tree structure. The bidirectional approach for a tree structure uses information both from under and lower nodes of the tree for a particular node j. In this manner, a newly calculated activation incorporates content from both the children and the parent of a particular node. The bidirectional neural network can be trained in two seperate phases: i) the Upward phase and ii) the Downward phase. During the Upward phase, the network topology is similar to the topology of a TreeGru, every activation is calculated based on the previously calculated activations which are found lower on the structure in a bottom up fashion. When every activation has been computed, from leaves to root, then the root activation is used as input of the Downward phase. The Downward phase calculates the activations for every child of a node using content from the parent in a top down fashion. The process of computing the internal representations between the two phases is separated, so in a first pass the network compute the upward activation and after this is completed, then the downward representations are computed. The upward activation h↑j similarly to TreeGRU for node j is the interpolation of the previous calculated activation h↑jk of its kth child out of N total children and the candidate activation h̃↑j .\nh↑j = z ↑ j ∗ N∑ k=1 h↑jk + (1− z ↑ j ) ∗ h̃ ↑ j (5)\nThe update gate, rest gate and candidate activation are computed as follows:\nz↑j = σ(Uz ∗ x ↑ j + N∑ k=1 W kz ∗ h ↑ jk) (6)\nr↑j = σ(Ur ∗ x ↑ j + N∑ k=1 W kr ∗ h ↑ jk) (7)\nh̃↑j = f(Uh ∗ x ↑ j + N∑ k=1 W kr ∗ (h ↑ jk ∗ r ↑ j )) (8)\nThe downward activation h↑j for node j is the interpolation of the previous calculated activation h↑p(j), where the function p calculates the index of the parent node, and the candidate activation h̃↓j .\nh↓j = z ↓ j ∗ h ↓ p(j) + (1− z ↓ j ) ∗ h̃ ↓ j (9)\nThe update gate, reset gate and candidate activation for the downward phase are computed as follows:\nz↓j = σ(U d z ∗ h ↑ j +W d z ∗ h ↓ p(j)) (10)\nr↓j = σ(U d r ∗ h ↑ j +W d r ∗ h ↓ p(j)) (11)\nh̃↓j = f(U d h ∗ h ↑ j +W d h ∗ (h ↓ p(j) ∗ r ↓ j )) (12)\nDuring downward phase, matrix Ud ∈ Rdxd connects the upward representation of node j with the respective jth downward node while W d ∈ Rdxd connect the parent representation p(j)."

Among the approaches reported in the literature, the highest accuracy is yielded by DRNN and DMN for the binary scheme (88.6), and by DMN for the fine-grained scheme (52.1). We observe that the best performance is achieved by TreeBiGRU with attention, for both binary (89.5) and fine-grained (52.4) evaluation metrics, exceeding any previously reported results. In addition, the attentional mechanism employed in the proposed TreeGRU and TreeBiGRU models improve the performance for both evaluation metrics."

The word embeddings are initialized using the public available Glove vectors with a 300 dimensionality. The Glove vectors provide 95.5% coverage for the SST dataset. All initialized word vectors are finetuned during the training process along with every other parameter. Every matrix is initialized with the identity matrix multiplied by 0.5 except for the matrices of the softmax layer and the attention layer which are randomly initialized from the normal Gaussian distribution. Every bias vectors is initialized with zeros. The training process lasts for 40 epochs. During training, we evaluate the network 4 times every epoch and keep the parameters which give the best root accuracy on the development dataset."

Our model expands the current recursive models by incorporating structural information around a node of a syntactic tree using both bottomup and top-down information propagation. Also, the model utilizes structural attention to identify the most salient representations during the construction of the syntactic tree. To our knowledge, the proposed models achieve state of the art performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.",
