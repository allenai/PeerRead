      "text" : "Cognates are genetically related words that can be traced to a common word in a language that is no longer spoken. For example, English nail and German nagel are cognates with each other which can be traced back to the stage of Proto-IndoEuropean *h3enogh−. Accurate identification of cognates is important for inferring the internal structure of a language family.\nRecent years has seen an surge in the number of publications in the field of computational historical linguistics due to the availability of word lists for large number of languages of the world [Brown et al., 2013]1 and cognate databases for Austronesian [Greenhill and Gray, 2009] and Indo-European [Bouckaert et al., 2012].\nThe availability of word lists (without cognate judgments) has allowed scholars like Rama and Borin [2015] and Jäger [2015] to experiment with different weighted string similarity measures for the purpose of inferring the family trees of world’s languages, without explicit cognate identification. On the other hand, List [2012] proposed a cognate clustering system that combines handcrafted weighted string similarity measures and permutation tests for the purpose of automated cognate identification. In a different approach, Hauer and Kondrak [2011] experimented\n1Known as Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP). http://asjp.clld.org/\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n04 93\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 Fe\nb 20\nwith linear classifiers like SVMs for the purpose of identifying cognate clusters. Finally, Rama [2015] use string kernel inspired features for training a SVM linear classifier for pair-wise cognate identification. As noted by Hauer and Kondrak [2011], availability of a reliable multilingual cognate identification system can be used to supply the cognate judgments as an input to the phylogenetic inference algorithms introduced by Gray and Atkinson [2003] and reconstruction methods of Bouchard-Côté et al. [2013].2\nThe phylogenetic inference methods require cognate judgments which are only available for a small number of well-studied language families such as Indo-European and Austronesian. For instance, the ASJP database provides Swadesh word lists (of length 40 which are resistant to lexical replacement and borrowing) transcribed in a uniform format for more than 60% of the world’s languages. However, the cognacy judgments are only available for a subset of language families. An example of such a word list is given in table 1.\nThe task at hand is to automatically cluster words that show genealogical relationship. This is achieved by computing similarities between all the word pairs belonging to a meaning and then supplying the resulting distance matrix as an input to a clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm groups the words into clusters by optimizing a similarity criterion. The similarity between a word pair can be computed using supervised approaches [Hauer and Kondrak, 2011] or by using sequence alignment algorithms such as Needleman-Wunsch [Needleman and Wunsch, 1970] or Levenshtein distance [Levenshtein, 1966].\nIn dialectometry, Wieling et al. [2007] compared Pair Hidden Markov Model (PHMM) [Mackay and Kondrak, 2005] and pointwise mutual information (PMI) [Church and Hanks, 1990] weighted Levenshtein distance for Dutch dialect comparison. In historical linguistics, Jäger [2013] developed a PMI based method for computing the string similarity using the ASJP database. In this paper, we apply online algorithms to train our PMI and PHMM systems for the purpose of computing word similarity.\n2The cognate clustering system in Bouchard-Côté et al. [2013] requires the tree structure of the language family to be know beforehand. This is not a practical assumption since the tree structure of many language families of the world is not known beforehand.\nWe train our PHMM and PMI systems in different settings and test it on sixteen different families of the world. Our results show that online training can perform better than a linguistically well-informed system known as LexStat [List, 2012]. Also, the online algorithms allow our systems to be trained in few minutes and give similar accuracies as the batch trained systems of Jäger [2013].\nThe paper is organized as follows. We discuss the relevant work in section 2. We describe the PMI and PHMM models in section 3. The Online EM procedure is described in section 4. We describe the clustering algorithm in section 5. We discuss the experimental settings and motivation behind our choices in section 6. We present and discuss the results of our experiments in section 7. We discuss the effect of different model parameters in section 8. Finally, we conclude the paper in section 9."

The author evaluated his algorithm on a list of EnglishLatin cognates. In this paper, we evaluate on the Indo-European dataset consisting of English and Latin.\nHauer and Kondrak [2011] trained a linear SVM on word similarity features and use the SVM model to assign a similarity score to the word pair. For each meaning, a word pair distance matrix is computed and supplied to the average linkage clustering algorithm for inferring cognate clusters. The authors observe that the SVM trained system performs better than a baseline that judges the similarity of two words based on the identity of the first two consonants.\nList [2012] introduced a system known as LexStat (described in section 6) that is sensitive to segment similarities and chance similarities due to borrowing or semantic shift. The author tests this system on a number of small-sized (consisting of less than 20 languages) datasets for the purpose of cognate identification and reports that the system performs better than Levenshtein distance.\nIn a recent paper, List et al. [2016] explore the use of InfoMap [Rosvall and Bergstrom, 2008] for the detection of partial cognates in subgroups of Sino-Tibetan language family. The authors compare the performance of average linkage clustering against InfoMap and find that InfoMap performs better than average linkage clustering.\nThe above listed works test similar datasets using different experimental settings. For instance, Hauer and Kondrak [2011] trained and tested on a subset of language families that were provided by Wichmann and Holman [2013]. At the same time, to the best of our knowledge, the LexStat system has not been evaluated on all the available language families. Moreover, the PMI-LANG [Jäger, 2013], has not been evaluated at the task of unsupervised cognate clustering."

      "text" : "The vanilla Needleman-Wunsch (VNW) algorithm is the similarity counterpart of the Levenshtein distance. It maximizes similarity whereas Levenshtein distance minimizes the distance. In VNW, a character or sound segment match increases the similarity by 1 and a character mismatch has a weight of −1. In contrast to Levenshtein distance which treats insertion, deletion, and substitution equally, VNW introduces a gap opening (deletion operation) penalty parameter that has to be set separately. A second parameter known as gap extension penalty has lesser or equal penalty than the gap opening parameter and models the fact that deletions occur in chunks Jäger [2013].\nVNW is not sensitive to segment pairs, but a realistic algorithm should assign higher similarity score to sound correspondences such as /l/ ∼ /r/ than the sound correspondences /p/ ∼ /r/. The weighted Needleman-Wunsch algorithm requires a similarity score for each pair of segments, and it finds the alignment(s) betwen two input strings maximizing the sum of the pairwise similiarities of matched segment pairs.\nIn computational historical linguistics, similarity between two segments is estimated using PMI. The PMI score for two sounds i and j is defined as followed:\nPMI(i, j) = log p(i, j)\nq(i) · q(j) (1)\nwhere, p(i, j) is the probability of i, j being matched in a pair of cognate words, whereas, q(i) is the probability that an arbitrarily chosen segment in an arbitrarily chosen word equals i. A positive PMI value between i and j indicates that the probability of i being aligned with j in a pair of cognates is higher than what would be expected by chance. Conversely, a negative PMI value indicates that an alignment of i with j is more likely the result of chance than of shared inheritance.\nWe estimated PMI scores from raw data, largely following the method described in Jäger [2013].\nThe whole training procedure can be described as follows:\n1. Extract a set of word pairs that are probably cognate using a suitable heuristics. In this paper, we treat all word pairs belonging to the same meaning with a length normalized Levenshtein distance (LDN) below 0.5 as probable cognates.3\n3We experimented with LDN cutoffs of 0.25 and 0.75 and found that the results are best for a cutoff of 0.5\n2. Align the list of probable cognates using the vanilla Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.\n3. Extract aligned segment pairs and compute the PMI value for a segment pair using equation 1 and estimating probabilities as relative frequencies.\n4. Generate a new set of aligments using Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and the segment weights learned from step 2. For the gap penalties we used the values proposed in Jäger [2013].\n5. We iterate between step 2 and 3 until the average similarity between the two iterations does not change.\nThis procedure yields a PMI based similarity score for each word pair. We convert the similarity score x into a distance score using the sigmoid transformation: 1.0 − (1 + exp(−x))−1 that converts the PMI similarity score into the range of [0, 1]."

      "text" : "Pair Hidden Markov Model was first proposed in the context of computational biology as a tool for the comparison of DNA or protein sequences [Durbin et al., 2001].\nA Pair Hidden Markov Model (PHMM) uses two output streams, instead of a single output stream; one for each of the two sequences being aligned. In its simplest version, a PHMM consists of five states. A begin state, an end state, a match state (M) that emits pairs of symbols, a deletion state (X) that emits a symbol in the first string and a gap in the second string; and an insertion state (Y) that emits a gap in the first and a symbol in the second string (cf. figure 1).\nThe PHMMs, as used in historical linguistics, differ from its biological counterpart in the following regard:\n• The historical linguistic PHMM allows a transition between the states X and Y (dashed line, figure 1). An alignment of Italian due and Spanish dos ‘two’ cannot be generated by a PHMM without the transition between X and Y [Mackay and Kondrak, 2005].\nd u e - d o - s\n• Another difference between the biological and the linguistic PHMM is the split of the parameter for the transition into the end state. Whilst the original version only has one parameter for this purpose, the linguistic PHMM makes use of two different probabilities τM and τXY . This split of parameters enables the model to distinguish between the match state (M) being the final\nemitting state or any of the gap states (X,Y) (see figure 1). This modification preserves the symmetry of the model, while allowing a little bit more freedom.\nThe PHMMs are trained using Baum-Welch expectation maximization algorithm [Durbin et al., 2001]. The best alignment between two sequences x and y is determined by using the Viterbi algorithm.\nThe probability of two sequences x and y of lengths m and n respectively evolving independently under a null model R is given by the following equation 2.\nP (x, y|R) = ι2(1− ι)n+m n∏ i=1 fxi m∏ j=1 fyj , (2)\nwith fxi is the equilibrium frequency of the sound at position i in sequence x where, ι = 1m+n\n2 +1 .\nThe probability of relatedness between x and y is computed as the logarithmic ratio of the probability scores P (x, y|µ) and P (x, y|R), where µ is the trained model and R is the null model.\nWe employ the same sigmoid transformation, as in PMI, to convert the similarity score (computed under a PHMM) to a distance score."

      "heading" : "4 Online EM",
      "text" : "The Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) is widely used in computational linguistics for the purpose of word alignment, document classification, and word\nsegmentation. The EM algorithm starts with an initial setting of model parameters and uses that model parameters to realign words in a sentence pair. The model parameters are reestimated using the word alignments obtained from the previous iteration. The EM algorithm reestimates the model parameters after each full scan of the training data.\nLiang and Klein [2009] observe that batch training procedure can lead to slow convergence. As a matter of fact, Jäger [2013] trains his PMI system using the standard EM (also known as batch EM) which updates the parameters in a PMI scoring matrix only after aligning all the word pairs. In contrast, Online EM [Liang and Klein, 2009], updates the model parameters after aligning a subset of word pairs (also known as minibatch in online learning literature).\nThe Online EM algorithm combines the parameters estimated (s) from the current update step k with the previous parameters θk−1 using the following equation:\nθk = (1− ηk)θk−1 + ηks (3)\nwhere ηk is defined as: ηk = (k + 2)−α. In the case of PMI, θ constitutes the PMI scores for all segment pairs. The parameter ηk determines how fast to forget or remember the updates from the previous steps. The α parameter is in the range of 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 1. A smaller α implies a large update to the model parameters. The parameter k is related to minibatch parameter (m; m = dD/ke; where, D is the size of training data) and determines the number of updates to be performed. The setting k = 1 recovers the batch EM whereas, when k = D, implies an update for each sample in the training data."

      "text" : "The InfoMap clustering method is an information theoretic approach to detect community structure within a connected network. The method uses random walks on a network as a proxy for information flow to detect communities, i.e., clusters, without the need for a threshold. A community is a group of nodes with more edges connecting the nodes within the community than connecting them with nodes outside the community [Newman and Girvan, 2004].\nIn our case, a community refers to the words which are cognate and have higher edge weights between them. The idea behind the algorithm is that the random walk is statistically more likely to spend a long period of time within a community than switching communities due to the nature of the network.\nA pair-wise distance matrix is a complete weighted graph and any edge that has a weight < 0.5 and a PMI score < 0 (due to the sigmoid-based distance transformation). Due to the PMI score’s definition, a PMI score< 0 implies that the words might not be cognate. We use this property to construct a non-complete graph and supply the resulting network as an input to the InfoMap algorithm."

This lack of performance could be due to the characteristics of the PHMM. The transition probability from the begin state to the match or gap states is the same as the transition probability from the match state to either gap state or itself (figure 1). Although desirable for biological purposes, this poses a big problem for linguistic applications. To start an alignment with a match is more likely than to start with a gap.9 Therefore, the alignments generated by PHHMs are more likely to show gaps at the end of the string than in the beginning. This results in problems for data sets where word length differ a lot. The PHMM performs the worst for those datasets that show a huge difference in the word length. On the other hand, for Kamasau and Tujia – the two datasets with the best performance – the difference in word length is much less pronounced (cf. figure 3).\nBased on the results of these experiments, we propose that training the PMIbased segment scores in an online fashion and supplied to InfoMap clustering could yield reliable cognate judgments.\n91− 2δτM is larger than δ in all models (c.f. figure 1)."

We find that training PMI and PHMM in an online fashion speeds up convergence and yields comparable or better results than the batch variant and the state-of-the-art LexStat system. Online PMI system shows the best performance across different language families. In conclusion, PMI systems can be trained faster in an online fashion and yield better accuracies than the current state-of-the-art systems."
