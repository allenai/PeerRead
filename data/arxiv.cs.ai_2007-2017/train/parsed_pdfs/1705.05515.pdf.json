Introduction Determining optimal alternative in group decision making is very important in management. Up to now, there are many researches for multipleobjective decision making problems that have more than one optimize purpose, fuzzy decision making problem in which information of alternative on criteria are fuzzy number, group decision making problem that have many decision makers.\nTo be concrete as follows:\nSome researchers[1,2] paid their attention to group decision-making problems, in which\ndecision-makers provide their preference information on alternative using different preference forms.\nLiterature[12] further established a single-objective optimization model to determine a optimal\nalternative from interval decision matrix and criteria weight intervals.\nThere are methods that get the optimal alternative by synthesizing conclusions of decision-makers when information of criteria weight is given partially and degree of satisfaction on criterias are expressed by triangle fuzzy number[3,4,5].\nLiterature[13] proposed a method for determining the preference of alternative by Borda’s method\nbased on preference of interval number when information of decision makers on evaluation alternative is stated by interval number.\nLiterature[11] proposed a new method for solution of Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decis ion Making by\nintroducing score function G that remove the defect of S function and H function.\nIn general, there are benefit attributes and cost attributes in multiple-attribute decis ion-making problems,\nand dimention of different attributes may be different.\nLiteratures[8,9] proposed a method that determine the optimal attribute based on Satisfactory Matrix\nnmij   )( which is mapped from D according to criteria type(benefit attribute or cost attribute)\nLiteratures[6,7] present a group decision making method that decreases disagreement of\ndecision-makers by fuzzy programming method when required information is given as a supplementary decision matrix.\nLiterature[10] divided decision making problem into several subproblems when composition of decision makers is very complex and scale of it is very large, and presented a method that determines the solution of decision making problem based on the solution of every subproblem.\nThe shortcomings of preceding methods for fuzzy multi-criteria group decision-making are as follows: First, in fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making problem, a method to determine of criterias ’ weight\nwas supported in case that required information of decision makers were given in different forms, but if any decision makers gave their required information in form of multiplicative preference relation, then supported model can not include in full requirement of decision makers.\nSecond, a method to determine optimal alternative based on relationship analysis between criterias was supported in case that satisfactory matrixes were given by triangle fuzzy number in fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making problem. But dividing algorithm of criterias that is subalgorithm of optimal alternative determining algorithm unilaterally divides two subsets of all criterias, so conflict or irrelevant\ncriterias may be in one subset.\nThird, in case that satisfactory matrix is given by triangle fuzzy number, final degree for evaluation of alternatives is also triangle fuzzy number, so, satisfactory degree of alternative on criterias is not quantitativelly expressed.\nFor this reason, in the second part of this paper, we propose a model to determine weights reasonably in consideration of left or right limited value in case that there are decision makers who give their required information in form of multiplicative preference relation in fuzzy multi-criterias group decision making\nproblem.\nIn the third part we newly support a dividing algorithm of criterias ’ set for determing optimal alternative, thus all criterias of one subset cooperate with each other, and then a final evaluation degree to evaluate alternatives based on relationship analys is between criterias in case that satisfactory matrixes are represented by triangle fuzzy number.\nIn the fourth part we verified the effectiveness of supported methods by solving example.\n2. A METHOD FOR DETERMINING WEIGHTS OF CRITERIAS 2.1 Type of Information Expression of Decision-makers on criteria weights In group decision-making problem, a decision-maker can represent weight information of criteria as\none of the following three different expression forms[9].\nFirst, Utility values }~~,~{ ~\n21 n uuuU  : ),,(~ jjjj uuumulu  indicates utility interval of criteria weights,\nwhere 10  jjj uuumul ( nj ,1 ), and jul , jum , juu are infimum, median, supremum of weight of\ncriteria jc .\nSecond, Preference relation nnij pP \n )~( ~\n: ),,(~ ijijijij pupmplp  indicates the preference degree of\ncriteria i c over jc and is the preference information on ijp that is described by the following formula\n)1(5.0  jiij wwp ,\nWhere ij pl , ij pm , ij pu are infimum, median, supremum of ij p , and i w , jw are weights of criteria ic ,\nj c .\nFrom the definition, the following condition is satisfied\n10  ijijij pupmpl , 1 jiijjiijjiij plpupmpmpupl , 5.0 iiiiii pupmpl ( nji ,1,  )\nThird, Multiplicative preference relation nnij bB \n ) ~ ( ~ : ),,( ~\nijijijij bubmblb  indicates multiplicative\npreference degree of criteria i c over jc and is the preference information on ijb that is described by the\nfollowing formula\nj\ni\nij w\nw b \nwhere ij bl , ij bm , ij bu are infimum, median, supremum of ij b , and i w , jw are weights of criteria ic ,\nj c .\nFrom the definition, the following condition is satisfied.\nijijij bubmbl 0 , 1 jiijjiijjiij blbubmbmbubl , 1 iiiiii bubmbl ( nji ,1,  )\nAbove three expression forms are the most general forms that can represent criteria weight\ninformation .\n2.2 A Method For Determining Weights of Criterias\nIn decision-making problem, let n www ,,, 21  be the determined weight of criterias. If these weights satisfy the requirement of all decision-makers that are represented above three forms, the\nfollowing condition must be satisfied for nji ,1, \njjj uuwul  (1)\n1 2)( jjjj emumw  (2)\nijjiij puwwpl  )1(5.0 (3)\n  2 2 )1(5.0 ijijijji empmww  (4)\nij\nj\ni\nij bu\nw\nw bl  (5)\n3\n2\nijijij\nj\ni embm w\nw \n  \n\n  \n  ( 0jw ) (6)\nwhere 1j , 2ij , 3ij are nonnegative real numbers that is small sufficiently.\nGenerally, it is difficult to satisfy all requirements of decision-makers.\nTherefore, we must determine the reasonable criteria weight that relax the contradiction of information\nas possible and satisfy requirements of the decision-makers as possible.\nFor group decision-making problems with t decision-makers, without loss of generality, we suppose\nthat decision maker k (k=1,…, 1 t ) provides his preference information by means of the utility values,\ndecision maker k (k= 1 1 t ,…, 2 t ) provides his preference information by means of the preference relation and decision maker k (k= 1 2 t ,…, t ) provides his preference information by means of the multiplicative preference relation.\nIn order to determine the weight vector of criterias, we establish the following linear programming\nproblem.\n[M]                \nn\nj\nt\nd\nn\nji\nt\ntd\nd\nij\nd\nij\nd\nijJ\nd\nj\nd\nj\nd\njJ euemelweuemelwE\ndd\n1 1 1, 1\n)()()()()()( 1\n1\n)()(min (7)\n  1 2)()( ,1,,1,t.s. tdnjumwem d jj d j \n \nttdnjielbl w\nw\nttdnjibm w\nw em\nttdnjieupuww\nttdnjielplww\nttdnjipmwwem\ntdnjeuel\ntdnjeuuuw\ntdnjelulw\nd\nij\nd\nij\nj\ni\nd\nij\nj\nid\nij\nd\nij\nd\nijji\nd\nij\nd\nijji\nd\nijji\nd\nij\nd\nj\nd\nj\nd\nj\nd\njj\nd\nj\nd\njj\n,1,,1,,\n,1,,1,,\n,1,,1,,)1(5.0\n,1,,1,,)1(5.0\n,1,,1,,)1(5.0\n,1,,1,0,\n,1,,1,\n,1,,1,\n2\n)()(\n2\n2\n)()(\n21\n)()(\n21\n)()(\n21\n2)()(\n1\n)()(\n1\n)()(\n1\n)()(\n\n   \n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nttdnjieuel\nttdnjieubu w\nw\nd ij d ij\nd ij d ij\nj\ni\n,1,,1,,0,\n,1,,1,,\n1 )()(\n2 )()(\n\n\n \n n\nj\njj njww\n1\n,1,0,1\nWhere )(d j el , )(d j eu ( 1 ,1,,1 tdnj  ), )(d ij el , )(d ij eu ( nji ,1,  , ttd ,1 1  ) are preference information\ndeviation value of decision maker d J and dJ w is weight of decision maker d J\nDecision makers can adjust the preference information with nonzero deviation values by compromising\ntheir requirement. Adjusting method is that it give a limited value at first, and then turn up supremum a little, turn down infimum a little on equal terms with it doesn’t exceed limited interval. At this time amount\nof change is proportionate with deviation value and extends the range of triangle fuzzy number that represents required information a little wide.\nAnd we establish the model again on the basis of changed preference information value and get the\ndeviation values again.\nIf this procedure is repeated until all of the deviation values come to zero, the final weight values is just\nthe optimal criteria weight vector satisfying the requirement of every decision makers.\n3. A METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL ALTERNATIVE For Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making Problem, here consider a new methodology for\nselecting the appropriate alternative among feasible alternative set A in the case that j i d ( mi ,1 , nj ,1 )\nis given by triangular fuzzy number, decision matrix D is mapping to the matrix of degree of satisfaction and weight of decision makers is given as follows:\n),,,( 21 tJJJJ wwwW  , 1 1  \nt\nd\nJd w\nThe the matrix of degree of satisfaction of decision maker d J ( td ,1 ) is expressed as follows:\n \n     \n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n \n)()()(\n)()()(\n)()()(\n)( ~\n)()(\n2\n)(\n1\n)( 2 )( 22 )( 21\n)( 1 )( 12 )( 11\n)()(\nxxx\nxxx\nxxx\nx\nd\nmn\nd\nm\nd\nm\nd n dd\nd n dd\nnm\nd\nij\nd\n\n\n\n , ( td ,1 ) (8)\nwhere ),,()( )()()()( d ij d ij d ij d ij x   .\nWhen there are several criterias for evaluating the alternatives, generally, some relationships between\ncriterias exist.\nIf an increase of the degree of satisfaction for one criteria causes to increase the degree of satisfaction for other criteria, then a pair of two criterias are said to be cooperative. If an increase of the degree of\nsatisfaction for one criteria causes to decrease the degree of satisfaction for other criteria, then a pair of two criterias are said to be conflictive. If an increase of the degree of satisfaction for one criterion doesn’t cause the variation of the degree of satisfaction, then a pair of two criterias are said to be independent\n[Definition 1:]\nDefine a triangular fuzzy number )(x ijk  as follows.\n)()( xx ikijk\n \n ⊖ )(xjk\nwhere ⊖ denotes to extended subtraction of fuzzy numbers and )(x ijk  indicates the degree of\nsatisfaction of alternative ji aa , for criteria kc .\nAssume that )(x ijk  is a triangular fuzzy number ),,()( ijkijkijkijk x   .\n[Difinition 2:] (Cooperative degree and conflicting degree)\nCooperative degree:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPaa\nijlijk\nCPaa\nijlijk\nlk\nji\nji cccp\n),(\n),(\n|)||(|\n|)||(|\n),( \n\n(9)\nConflicting degree:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPaa\nijlijk\nCFaa\nijlijk\nlk\nji\nji cccf\n),(\n),(\n|)||(|\n|)||(|\n),( \n\n(10)\nlk cc , : two criterias, },,|),{( jiAaaaaAP jiji  : a set of alternatives pairs,\n}0)()()()(|),{( 0000                x ijl x ijl x ijk x ijkji xxxxaaCP \n}0)()()()(|),{( 0000                x ijl x ijl x ijk x ijkji xxxxaaCF \nCPAP  ∪ CF ∪ IR\n}0)()()()(|),{( 0000                x ijl x ijl x ijk x ijkji xxxxaaIR \nCP ∩ CF = CF ∩ IR = CP ∩ IR\nIn order to evaluate several alternatives for multi-criteria, devide overall set of criterias into two subsets based on conflicting, cooperative and irrelevant relation such that all criterias in each subset cooperate with each other.\nThe algorithm for dividing a set of criterias is as follows.

Then, we apply above introduced method to remaining criterias ’ set. In result, all criterias are classified into several classes.\nNext the final degree of satisfaction is calculated as follows:\n)()( )()()(\n)(\nxwa d ki\nSc\nd\nik\nd\nd\nqi\n  \n  (11)\nwhere q satisfies following relation.\n\n  \n\n  \n   )()(2 )( 1 )( )()()()( ,,,max d\ndzi\nd\ni\nd\ni\nd\nqi Sc\nd\ni\nSc\nd\ni\nSc\nd\ni\nSc\nd\ni wwww\nNext, we get an intergrated final degree of satisfaction by intergrating the final degree of satisfaction of\nall decision-makers.\nThe intergrated final degree of satisfaction is calculated as follows:\n \n  t\nd\nk\nd\nJk awa\nd\n1\n)( )()(  (12)\nwhere dJ w is a weight of decision-maker d J .\nAn alternative that has maximum intergrated final degree of satisfaction is a optimal alternative.\n4.

So supported determining method of weights reduces errors to 87.8%.\nAt this time, we evaluate the effectiveness of determing method of optimal alternative. At first, we use the precedent method.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we supported a model to determine the weight of criterias based on considering infimum and supremum of information in case that the requirement information of decision makers were given in\nvarious forms, and suggested a dividing algorithm of criterias’ set to determine the optimal alternative. Also we defined a new final evaluation criterion and evaluated the effectiveness of suggested method through solving actual problem.\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.Ma, Z.P.Fan, Y.P.Jiang, and J.Y.Mao, An optimization approach to multiperson decision making based on different forms of preference imformation, IEEE Trans.Syst.,Man,Cybern.
