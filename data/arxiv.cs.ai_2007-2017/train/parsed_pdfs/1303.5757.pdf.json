      "text" : "1 INTRODUCTION\nOne of the major perceived problems with application of the Dempster-Shafer Theory [Shafer, 76] has been its apparent computational complexity e.g., [ Kyburg, 87], [Bonissone, 87]. This is because the Dempster Shafer theory as usually implemented involves re peated application of Dempster's Rule of Combina tion, keeping a record at each stage of each subset of 8 with a non-zero mass. For example the combination of m simple support functions can have as many as 2q non-zero masses where q is the minimum of m and 181, thus making the approach computationally infeasible for large m and 181.\nThere have been a number of schemes to deal with this; [ Barnett, 81] showed how calculation of Dempster Shafer belief in a very special case, when all the ev idence sets are either singletons or complements of singletons, belief could be calculated in linear time. [ Gordon and Shortliffe, 85] extended this with an effi cient approximation to Dempster-Shafer belief for hier archically related evidences, and it was shown in both [ Shafer and Logan, 87] and [Wilson, 87] that the hi erarchical case could be dealt with exactly in a com putationally efficient manner. The Shafer-Logan al gorithm was generalised to propagation of belief func tions in Markov Trees [ Shafer and Shenoy, 88] but,\nalthough this is a very important contribution, it still requires that the product space associated with the largest clique is small, a condition which will by no means always be satisfied. The hierarchical evidence algorithm in [Wilson, 87] was generalised to arbitrary evidence sets [Wilson, 89] and, because it calculates belief directly without first calculating the masses, it leads to very substantial increases in efficiency (see sec tion 4). However this algorithm appears to have com plexity worse than polynomial, which is not surprising since Dempster's Rule is #?-complete [Orponen, 90], [ P rovan, 90].\nThis paper describes the Monte-Carlo algorithm given in [Wilson, 89] which also calculates belief directly (or, more accurately, it approximates belief up to arbi trary accuracy). This calculation has very low com plexity, showing that the general pessimism about the complexity of Dempster-Shafer Theory is mis guided. The use of Monte-Carlo algorithms for calcu lating Dempster-Shafer belief has also been suggested in [P earl, 88], [ Kampke, 88] and [ Kreinovich and Bar rett, 90].\n2 THE MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHM\nLet Belt, . .. , Belm be belief functions on a finite frame 8, and let Bel= Belt Etl· · ·EtlBelm be their combination using Dempster's Rule. Using the model of [Dempster, 67] Bel; is represented by a probability function P; (on a finite set rl;) and a compatibility function f; : rl; >--> 2° where the meaning of f; is 'for r E rl;, if r is true then so is f;( r)'. The mass function m; is given by: for c; E rl;, m;(f;(c;)) = P;(ci), and, for b S::: 8,\nBel;(b) = P;(f;(c;) s;; b), that is, I: P;(c;). ,,,r,(,,)�b\nLet n = nl X . . . X Slm and for c = (c), ... ,c,) define f (c) = n: 1 f;(c;). Define the 'independent\nprobability function' P' on f! by P'((c:1, . . . ,c:m)) n::1 P;(c:;). Using [Dempster, 67] it can be seen that\nBel(b) = P'(r(c:) <;; blf(c:) =1 0),\nwhere e.g. P'(r(c:) # 0) just means L<:r(<);>!0 P'(c:). r(c:) can be viewed as a random set [Nguyen, 78]. The Monte-Carlo algorithm just simulates the last equation.\nA large number, N, of trials are performed. For each trial:\n1. Randomly pick c: such that f(c:) # 0: a. For i = 1, ... , m\nrandomly pick an element of f!;, i.e. pick c; with probability P;(c;)\nLet c = (c:1, . . . ,em) b. If r(c:) = 0 then restart trial;\n2. If f(c:) <;; b then trial succeeds, letT= 1 else trial fails, let T = 0\nThe proportion of trials that succeed converges to Bel( b):\nE[T] = P'(r(c:) <;; bll'(c:) # 0) = Bel(b). Var[T] = E[T2]-(E[T])2 = E[T]-(E[T])2 = Bel(b)(1Bel(b)) :S: t· Let f be the average value ofT over the N trials, i.e., the proportion of trials that succeed.\nE[f] = N�T) = Bel(b) and Var[t] _ NVar[TJ < ...!.._ - N2 - 4N\nTherefore the variance (an<!_ so also the standard de viation) for the estimate, T, of Bel(b) can be made arbitrarily small independently of 181 and m. Let us say that the estimate t_ of Bel( b) 'has accuracy k' if 3 standard deviations ofT is less than or equal to k. Then f has accuracy k if N 2: -,&,-. Testing separately if r( c:) = 0 and if f( c:) <;; b wastes time; these tests can be combined within the same algorithm (where Xj denotes the jth element of 8):\nFor each trial:\nrepeat\npick c: with probability P'(c:) T0 := 1; T := 1 for j = 1 to 181\nif f(c:) 3 Xj then T0 := 0; (since f(c:) # 0) if Xj tf_ b then T := 0; exit trial;\nA Monte-Carlo Algorithm for Dempster-Shafer Belief 415\nend if end if\nnext j until T0 = 0\n(since r(c:) �b)\n3 COMPUTATION TIME\nPicking c; involves m random numbers so takes less than Am where A is constant, approximately the time it takes to generate a random number (with efficient storing of the P;s). Testing if r(c:) 3 Xj takes less than Bm for constant B. For a given trial there is a prob ability K = P'(r(c:) = 0) that the repeat-until loop will be entered a second time. The expected number of repeat-until loops per trial is 1��; K is a measure of the conflict of the evidences [Shafer, 76, p65].\nThus the expected time the algorithm takes is less than 1�� m(A + Bl81), and so the expected time to achieve accuracy k is less than 4(1 9�)pm(A + Bl81). At least for the case where the Bel;s are simple sup port functions, the condition f(c) 3 Xj can be tested more efficiently; under weak conditions this leads to expected time of less than 4(1 9�)k2 (Am+ Cl81) for constant C [Wilson, 89].\n4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nThe algorithm for the case where the Bel;s are simple support functions has been implemented and tested using the language Modula-2 on a SUN 3/60 worksta tion. The results showed that the value of A is much bigger than the value of C in this implementation, A being roughly 40�0 seconds and C roughly 50 �00 sec onds. A is essentially the time taken to ge�erate a random number, and 40100 seconds seems rather slow for that. This suggests that very substantial speed ups (of perhaps an order of magnitude or two) could be achieved by careful choice and use of the random number generator and the use of antithetic runs (so that the random number generator is only used once for several different data items).\nThe results indicate that, unless the evidences are ex tremely conflicting, the Monte-Carlo algorithm is prac tical for problems with large m and 8. For example, with K = 0.5, m = 181 = 40, and with 1000 tri als, the calculation of the approximate value of Bel(b) would be expected to take 20.6 seconds. The 1000 trials mean that the standard deviation is less than 0.016, and so the confidence interval for the correct value of belief corresponding to 3 standard deviations would be roughly [ b- 0.05, b + 0.05] . If instead we did 10,000 trials this would take a little over 3 minutes, and give a standard deviation of 0.005. Extrapolating the figures (which seems unlikely to cause problems in\n416 Wilson\nthis case) gives an approximate time of 1 minute for m = 101 = 120, with 1000 trials, and 5 minutes for m = 101 = 600.\nAlso in [Wilson, 89] an exact algorithm for calcu lating belief is described (related to those described in [P rovan, 90]) which involves expressing the event f(E) s;; b as a boolean expression and then calculat ing the probability of this using the laws of boolean algebra. Again this avoids explicit calculation of the masses. The complexity for the simple support func tion case appears to be approximately of the form l0llogm.\nThe usual approaches for calculating belief are mass based: they calculate the combined mass function and use this to calculate the appropriate belief (a good one of these is the fast Mobius transform in [Kennes and Smets, 90]). For large m and 0 this is of necessity very computationally expensive, since if q = min(m, 101), there can be as many as 2q masses. For simplicity it is assumed that the calculation of belief then just does 2q REAL multiplications. The speed of REAL multipli cation was tested on the same workstation and within the same language that the Exact and Monte-Carlo al gorithms were tested and implemented on and it was found that it did just over 104 REAL multiplications per second. This gives the following results:\nm,n MC Exact Mass-based 2: 15 X 15 7 sees 9 sees 3 sees 20 X 20 11 sees 13 sees 1 min 25 X 25 13 sees 46 sees 1 hour 30 X 30 15 sees 3 mins 1 day 35 X 35 17 sees 8 mins 1 month 50 X 50 25 sees 2 hours 3000 years\nThe values for the Monte-Carlo algorithm were based on doing 1000 trials and the contradiction being 0.5. The figure of 2 hours for the Exact in the 50 case is a very rough upper bound derived from insufficient data.\nDetails of the experiments and the full results and analysis are given in [Wilson, 90b].\n5 THE GENERALISED\nALGORITHM\nThe algorithm can be generalised to deal with arbi trary logics [Wilson, 90a]. Let L be the language of some logic. For each i, Bel; is now a function from L to [0, 1] saying how much the evidence warrants belief in propositions in L and the compatibility function is a function f; : ll; f-> L. The combined compatibility function r is now defined by\nm f((El, ... ,Em)) = 1\\ f;(E;),\ni=l\n(or f((El, . . . , Em)) = the set {f;(E;) : i = 1, ... , m} if the logic doesn't have conjunction).\nFor each trial:\n1. Randomly pick E such that f(E) is not contradictory:\na. For i = 1, . . . , m randomly pick an element of ll;, i.e. pick E; with probability P;(t:;)\nLet E = (<!, . . . ,Em) b. If f(c:) is contradictory then restart trial;\n2. If b can be deduced from r(c:) then trial succeeds, let T = 1 else trial fails, let T = 0\nUndecidability and semi-decidability would clearly cause problems, in which case trials which went on for too long would have to be cut short; if T for these trials was given the value 0 then this would lead to a lower bound for Bel(b). This technique of prematurely halting trials that take too long could be used to in crease the efficiency for other cases as well, at the cost of only finding lower and upper bounds for Bel( b).\nThe time this algorithm takes is then approximately ���(Am + R) where R is the average time it takes to see if f(c:) is contradictory, and if f(c:) allows b to be deduced. Given that the weight of conflict of the ev idences is bounded this means that the complexity is proportional to that of proof in the logic; it is hard to see how any sensible uncertainty calculus could do bet ter than this (although the complexity for this Monte Carlo algorithm has a very large constant term if high accuracy is required).\nAs Shafer points out [Shafer, 90] 101 can be a large product space, making the first algorithm impractical. The generalised algorithm can also be used to greatly improve the complexity of the algorithms for calcu lating Belief in Markov trees [Shafer and Shenoy, 88]. For each trial, propositions (i.e. belief functions with a single focal element) must be propagated through the Markov tree. The complexity is then proportional to that of propagating propositions, rather than the whole belief functions. Some other propositional cases have been dealt with in [Wilson, 89].\n6 DISCUSSION\nThere are two obvious drawbacks with the Monte Carlo algorithm:\n(i) if very high accuracy is required then the Monte Carlo algorithm will require a large number of trials (quadratic in the reciprocal of accuracy) so giving a very high constant factor to the complexity;\n(ii) when the evidence is highly conflicting the Monte Carlo algorithm loses some of its efficiency. I don't see\nthis as a great problem since an extremely high weight of conflict would suggest, except in exceptional circum stances, that Dempster's Rule is being applied when it is not valid, e.g. updating a Bayesian prior with a Dempster-Shafer belief function [see Wilson, 91]. I also argue there that, although Dempster's Rule has strong justifications for the combination of a finite number of simple support functions, the more general case has not been convincingly justified: the Monte-Carlo algo rithm is guaranteed to give results in accordance with Dempster's Rule, but it remains to be seen if these are always sensible.\nIt may be important to know which relatively small sets have relatively high beliefs: the Monte-Carlo algo rithm can be easily applied to deal with this problem.\nDempster's Rule makes particular independence as sumptions, using a single probability function on 0. By modifying step 1 of the algorithms the beliefs cor responding to other probability functions on n can be calculated.\nAcknowledgements\nI am currently supported by the ESPRIT basic re search action DRUMS (3085).
