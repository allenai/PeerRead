      "text" : "Neural network based methods have recently demonstrated promising results on many natural language processing tasks [1, 2]. Specifically, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) based methods have shown strong performances, for example, in language modeling [3], language understanding [4], and machine translation [5, 6] tasks.\nThe main task of a language understanding (LU) system is to associate words with semantic meanings [7–9]. For example, in the sentence ”Please book me a ticket from Hong Kong to Seattle”, a LU system should tag ”Hong Kong” as the departurecity of a trip and ”Seattle” as its arrival city. The widely used approaches include conditional random fields (CRFs) [8, 10], support vector machine [11], and, more recently, RNNs [4, 12].\nA RNN consists of an input, a recurrent hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer reads each word and the output layer produces probabilities of semantic labels. The success of RNNs can be attributed to the fact that RNNs, if successfully trained, can relate the current prediction with input words that are several time steps away. However, RNNs are difficult to train, because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem [13]. The problem also limits RNNs’ memory capacity because error signals may not be able to back-propagated far enough.\nThere have been two lines of researches to address this problem. One is to design learning algorithms that can avoid gradient exploding, e.g., using gradient clipping [14], and/or gradient vanishing, e.g., using second-order optimization methods [15]. Alternatively, researchers have proposed more advanced model architectures, in contrast to the simple RNN that\nuses, e.g., Elman architecture [16]. Specifically, the long shortterm memory (LSTM) [17,18] neural networks have three gates that control flows of error signals. The recently proposed gated recurrent neural networks (GRNN) [6] may be considered as a simplified LSTM with fewer gates.\nAlong this line of research on developing more advanced architectures, this paper focuses on a novel neural network architecture. Inspired by the recent work in [19], we extend the simple RNN with Elman architecture to using an external memory. The external memory stores the past hidden layer activities, not only from the current sentence but also from past sentences. To predict outputs, the model uses input observation together with a content retrieved from the external memory. The proposed model performs strongly on a common language understanding dataset and achieves new state-of-the-art results.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We briefly describe background of this research in Sec. 2. Section 3 presents details of the proposed model. Experiments are in section 4. We relate our research with other works in Sec. 5. Finally, we have conclusions and discussions in Sec. 6."

In these alignments, an input may correspond to a null tag or a single tag.

In Elman architecture [16], hidden layer activity ht is dependent on both the input xt and also recurrently on the past hidden layer activity ht−1.\nBecause of the recurrence, the hidden layer activity ht is dependent on the observation sequence from its beginning. The posterior probability is therefore computed as follows\np(yT1 |xT1 ) ≈ T∏ t=1 p(yt|xt1)\n= T∏ t=1 p(yt|ht, xt) (2)\nwhere the output yt and hidden layer activity ht are computed as\nyt = g(ht), (3) ht = σ(xt, ht−1).

The above model is denoted as simple RNN, to contrast it with more advanced recurrent neural networks described below."

      "heading" : "2.3. Recurrent neural networks using gating functions",
      "text" : "The current hidden layer activity ht of a simple RNN is related to its past hidden layer activity ht−1 via the nonlinear function in Eq. (4). The non-linearity can cause errors back-propagated from ht to explode or to vanish. This phenomenon prevents simple RNN from learning patterns that are spanned with long time dependence [14].\nTo tackle this problem, long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network was proposed in [17] with an introduction of memory cells, linearly dependent on their past values. LSTM also introduces three gating functions, namely input gate, forget gate and output gate. We follow a variant of LSTM in [18].\nMore recently, a gated recurrent neural network (GRNN) [6] was proposed. Instead of the three gating functions in LSTM, it uses two gates.\nOne is a reset gate rt that relates a candidate activation with the past hidden layer activity ht−1; i.e.,\nĥt = tanh(Wxhxt +Whh(rt ht−1)) (5)\nwhere ĥt is the candidate activation. Wxh and Whh are the matrices relate the current observation xt and the past hidden layer activity. is element-wise product.\nThe second gate is an update gate zt that interpolates the candidate activation and the past hidden layer activity to update the current hidden layer activity; i.e.,\nht = (1− zt) ht−1 + zt ĥt. (6)\nThese gates are usually computed as functions of the current observation xt and the past hidden layer activity; i.e.,\nrt = σ(Wxrxt +Whrht−1) (7) zt = σ(Wxzxt +Whzht−1) (8)\nwhere Wxr and Whr are the weights to observation and to the past hidden layer activity for the reset gate. Wxz and Whz are similarly defined for the update gate."

      "text" : "We extend simple RNN in this section to using external memory. Figure 1 illustrates the proposed model, which we denote it as RNN-EM. Same as with the simple RNN, it consists of an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. However, instead of feeding the past hidden layer activity directly to the hidden layer as with the simple RNN, one input to the hidden layer is from a content of an external memory. RNN-EM uses a weight vector to retrieve the content from the external memory to use in the next time instance. The element in the weight vector is proportional to the similarity of the current hidden layer activity with the content in the external memory. Therefore, content that is irrelevant to the current hidden layer activity has small weights. We describe RNN-EM in details in the following sections. All of the equations to be described are with their bias terms, which we omit for simplicity of descriptions. We implemented RNN-EM using Theano [20, 21]."

Similar to the external memory in computers, the memory capacity of RNN-EM may be increased if using a large n.\nThe model generates a key vector kt to search for content in the external memory. Though there are many possible ways to generate the key vector, we choose a simple linear function that relates hidden layer activity ht as follows\nkt =Wkht (11)\nwhereWk ∈ Rm×p is a linear transformation matrix. Our intuition is that the memory should be in the same space of or affine to the hidden layer activity.\nWe use cosine distance K(u, v) = u·v‖u‖‖v‖ to compare this key vector with contents in the external memory. The weight for the c-th slot Mt(:, c) in memory Mt is computed as follows\nŵt(c) = expβtK(kt,Mt(:, c))∑ q expβtK(kt,Mt(:, q))\n(12)\nwhere the above weight is normalized and sums to 1.0. βt is a scalar larger than 0.0. It sharpens the weight vector when βt is larger than 1.0. Conversely, it smooths or dampens the weight vector when βt is between 0.0 and 1.0. We use the following function to obtain βt; i.e.,\nβt = log(1 + exp(Wβht)) (13)\nwhereWβ ∈ R1×p maps the hidden layer activity ht to a scalar. Importantly, we also use a scalar coefficient gt to interpolate the above weight estimate with the past weight as follows:\nwt = (1− gt)wt−1 + gtŵt (14)\nThis function is similar to Eq. (6) in the gated RNN, except that we use a scalar gt to interpolate the weight updates and the gated RNN uses a vector to update its hidden layer activity.\nThe memory content is retrieved from the external memory at time t− 1 using\nct =Mt−1wt−1.

We use the above linear function based on the same intuition in Sec. 3.2 that the new content and the hidden layer activity are in the same space of or affine to each other.\nRNN-EM has a forget gate as follows\nft = 1− wt et (17)\nwhere et ∈ Rn×1 is an erase vector, generated as et = σ(Wheht). Notice that the c-th element in the forget gate is zero only if both read weight wt and erase vector et have their c-th element set to one. Therefore, memory cannot be forgotten if it is not to be read.\nRNN-EM has an update gate ut. It simply uses the weight wt as follows\nut = wt. (18)\nTherefore, memory is only updated if it is to be read. With the above described two gates, the memory is updated as follows\nMt = diag(ft)Mt−1 + diag(ut)vt (19)\nwhere diag(·) transforms a vector to a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements from the vector.\nNotice that when the number of memory slots is small, it may have similar performances as a gated RNN.

To better illustrate their convergences, we have converted entropy values to their logarithms. The results show that RNN-EM converges to lower training entropy than other models. RNN-EM also converges faster than the simple RNN and LSTM.\nWe further repeated ATIS experiments for 10 times with different random seeds for these neural network models. We evaluated their performances after their convergences. Table 4 lists their averaged F1 scores, together with their maximum and minimum F1 scores. A change of 0.12% is significant at the 90% confidence level, when comparing against LSTM result. Results in Table 4 show that RNN-EM, on average, significantly outperforms LSTM.

This can be explained as using gate functions in Eqs. (17) and (18) in RNN-EM, which are absent in simple RNNs. RNN-EM with n = 1 also performed similarly as the gated RNN with 94.70% F1 score in Table 4, partly because of these gate functions.\nMemory capacity may be measured using training set entropy. Table 5 shows that training set entropy is decreased initially with n increased from 1 to 8, showing that the memory capacity of the RNN-EM is improved. However, the entropy is increased with ns further increased. This suggests that memory\ncapacity of RNN-EM cannot be increased simply by increasing the number of slots."

In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for future research.",
