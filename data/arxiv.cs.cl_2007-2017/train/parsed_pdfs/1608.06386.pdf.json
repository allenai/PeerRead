      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "It is not uncommon for researchers to envisage an information extraction system for scientific articles that can answer queries like, (i)what are all the techniques and tools used in machine translation?, (ii)Which are the subareas of computational linguistics, where Malt parser is frequently used? etc. However, the meta-information necessary for constructing such a system is rarely available. Each research domain consists of multiple application areas which are typically associated with various techniques used to solve problems in these areas. Knowledge of these typical techniques adopted for an application area is of crucial importance to a researcher focusing on that application area. For instance, two commonly used techniques in information extraction are conditional random fields and hidden markov models. Answering queries such as to obtain list of significant techniques given an application area or to obtain list of all application areas given a technique is extremely valuable to every researcher, but particularly for those who are venturing into a new area. An automated information extraction system would save humongous manual efforts to come up with such a list for each research field. Moreover, the lists are dynamic in nature, which further presents challenges in generation and automation. New techniques are added to the area with time and changing needs. Thus, it is of interest to the researcher to know the significant techniques for an area within a time frame. Thus, the temporal aspect is also of particular interest and raises diverse research questions - for example, how have the techniques for ”part-of-speech tagging” varied over time, or, what are the most important areas of computational linguistics that have been addressed in the last 5 years?\nIn this work, we demonstrate the system for the domain of computational linguistics because of the availability of fulltext research articles. However, the proposed schema can be easily generalized to any other field of research. Next, we define two common keywords used in the current paper: Area: Area represents an application area of computational linguistics domain. Common application areas include ‘machine translation’, ‘dependency parsing’, ‘part-of-speech tagging’, ‘information extraction’, ‘question answering’, etc. Technique: Technique either represents a tool or a task used in an area. Common examples include ‘Bleu score’, ‘Rouge score’, ‘Charniak parser’, ‘TnT tagger’, ‘Malt parser’, ‘MST parser’, etc. Note that technique of one paper can potentially be an area of another paper. For example, in “Training Nondeficient Variants of IBM-3 and IBM-4 for Word Alignment” [24], ‘word alignment’ is an area but in\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n06 38\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 A\nug 2\n01 6\n“Using Word-Dependent Transition Models in HMM-Based Word Alignment for Statistical Machine Translation” [8], ‘word alignment’ is a technique for machine translation.\nIn section 4, we describe an algorithmic approach to construct a mapping between a list of areas and a list of techniques which is further used to construct a summary table of the meta-data. The approach is organized into five important steps:\n1. We first create a ranked list of application areas;\n2. Given a research paper, we automatically assign it to one of the areas based on its title and abstract;\n3. Next, we create a ranked list of techniques;\n4. Given a paper, we automatically extract all the techniques it introduces;\n5. Finally, we automatically construct a mapping from the list of areas to the list of techniques.\nWe achieve significantly high performance in each of the above steps. The precision of the first step is 84% (for top 25) and recall is 87%. For the second step, the accuracy is 73.3%. The third step results in a precision and recall of 80% (for top 25) and 81% respectively. In the fourth step, our system achieves an accuracy of 60%. Finally, for the fifth step we present a number of relevant examples from the entire mapping. As a use case for this study, we analyze temporal characteristics of the techniques (Section 6). In an area, over the time, certain techniques become quite popular (as determined by the number of times that technique is cited by any paper) while certain techniques fall out of favor. Advent of social media is an example of this phenomenon where, due to different writing styles (short text length, use of out-of-vocabulary words, character flooding etc.), the need of new techniques is particularly essential. We further explore other aspects under temporal analysis – how the popular (as determined by the number of papers published in that area) areas in computational linguistics vary with time. We also investigate the temporal variation of the popular areas for specific conferences, namely, acl and coling."

      "text" : "Extracting application area and techniques is primarily an information extraction task. Information extraction (IE) from scientific articles combines approaches from natural language processing and data mining and has generated substantial research interest in recent times. In particular, there has been burgeoning research interest in the domain of biomedical documents. Shah et al. [25] extracted keywords from full text of biomedical articles and claim that there exist a heterogeneity in the keywords from different sections. Muller et al. [19] have developed the Textpresso framework, that leverage ontologies for information retrieval and extraction. In a similar work, Fukuda et al. [4] proposed an IE system for protein name extraction. There has been significant work in information extraction in the area of protein structure analysis. Gaizauskas et al. [5] proposed PASTA, an IE system developed and evaluated for the protein structure domain. Friedman et al. [3] have developed a similar system to extract structure information about cellular pathways using a knowledge model. Biological information extraction has\nseen extensive work covering diverse aspects with large number of survey papers. Cohen et al.’s [2] survey on biomedical text mining, Krallinger et al.’s [14] survey on information extraction and applications for biology and Wimalasuriya et al. [27] on ontology based information extraction are examples of some of the popular surveys on IE for biomedical domain.\nInformation extraction in other domains have also received an equally strong attention from researchers. Hyponym relations have been extracted automatically in the celebrated work by Hearst et al. [9]. Caraballo et al. [1] have extended previous work of automatically building semantic lexicons to automatic construction of a hierarchy of nouns and their hypernyms. Teufel [26] proposed information management and information foraging for researchers and introduced a new document analysis technique called argumentative zoning which is useful for generating user-tailored and tasktailored summaries. Kim et al. [12] and Lopez et al. [16] are two popular works in automatic keyphrase extraction from scientific articles. Quazvinian et al. [20] have explored summarization of scientific papers using citation summary networks and citation summarization through keyphrase extraction [21].\nJones [11] introduced an approach for entity extraction from labeled and unlabeled text. They proposed algorithms that alternately look at noun phrases and their local contexts to recognize members of a semantic class in context. A relatively recent work by Gupta et al. [7] developed a pattern learning system with bootstrapped entity extraction.In [6], they investigated the dynamics of a research community by extracting key aspects from scientific papers and showed how extracting key information help in analyzing the influence of one community on another. Jin at al. [10] proposed a supervised sequence labeling system that identifies scientific terms and their accompanying definition.\nIn our work, we have developed and tested an information extraction system that can extract the area and techniques from scientific papers and build a repertoire of such areas and techniques from the corpus. Further, we have constructed a mapping from each area to the list of techniques used for that area. As a use case for our developed system, we do a thorough temporal analysis for the variation of techniques for an area with time, temporal variation of popular areas for the entire AAN dataset and temporal variation of popular areas for top conferences in computational linguistics-namely, acl and coling."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe a method to construct a mapping between a list of areas and a list of techniques. As we already pointed out in the introduction, the mapping task is organized into five steps: (1) creation of a ranked list of areas, (2) categorizing papers on the basis of areas, (3)\ncreation of a ranked list of techniques, (4) categorizing papers on the basis of techniques, and (5) the final mapping between the list of areas to the list of techniques.\nThe current work has two-fold contribution. First, we develop a system which automatically extracts area and techniques used in a paper. Second, we create a mapping from area to corresponding popular techniques. Together, they can be thought of as structured metadata for individual scientific articles as well as a research field.\nNext, we briefly describe five phases in further details:"
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.1 Building the repertoire of areas",
      "text" : "We employ paper title information to extract areas. AAN provides paper title information as a metadata. We use hand-written rules to extract phrases which are likely to contain the area names. We observe that some functional keywords, such as, “for”, “via”,“using” and “with” act as delimiters for such phrases. For example, paper title, “Moses: Open source toolkit for statistical machine translation” [13] represents an instance of the form X for Y, where Y is the application area. We also observe that the phrase succeeding “for” or preceding “using” or both (e.g., in “Decision procedures for dependency parsing using graded constraints” [18]) are likely to contain the name of an application area. Seed set creation: We create a seed set of the above functional keywords and use bootstrapped pattern learning to gather more such words along with areas. For example, given a word ‘via’ in the seed set and paper title “NonMonotonic Sentence Alignment via Semisupervised Learning” [22], we extract the leading phrase (k-gram) before ‘via’. Further, we extend the seed set by extracting more functional keywords. For example, given a paper title “Improving English Russian sentence alignment through POS tagging and Damerau Levenshtein distance” [15] and the above extracted phrase (k-gram) alignment, we enrich the seed set by the functional keyword ‘through’. We had initially started with seven functional keywords and by bootstrapped pattern learning, augmented this to a final set of 11 functional keywords. Ranking of the extracted phrases: The previous step helps in extracting all the possible candidate phrases, which could potentially be area names. This set contains a lot of noisy phrases such as, “machine translation system combination and evaluation”. Here, “machine translation” must be extracted from the surrounding noisy words. Next, we use empirical ranking algorithms to extract the exact area names from this collection.We observe that empirical ranking algorithms produce good results in extraction of the exact area names from long phrases. We employ three ranking schemes, described below:\n• Scheme 1: In this scheme, we rank according to individual k-gram scores. The score of a given k-gram (K) is calculated as:\nScoreK = countK∑ j countj\n(1)\nwhere, countK represents occurrence count of the K th k-gram and the denominator represents total count of all the k-grams.\n• Scheme 2: In this scheme the scoring method is very similar to previous scheme. However, an additional heuristic employed is that if the score of a k-gram is\ngreater than both of its border (k− 1) grams then the border (k−1) grams are left out. The intuition behind this is as follows: the trigram “word sense disambiguation” will have a higher score than its border bigrams, “word sense”and“sense disambiguation”, causing these bigrams to be left out.\n• Scheme 3: This is an improvement on the previous method in that different threshold scores are chosen for bigrams, trigrams, 4-grams and 5-grams below which they are eliminated. All higher order k-grams are also eliminated. Unigrams were also not selected based on a pilot experiment with only unigrams which indicated that application areas are not usually unigrams. The thresholds were selected manually by observing the individual lists for each value of k = 2, 3, 4 and 5. In the result section, we shall compare the precision of each of these methods and we have finally adopted Scheme 3 since it gives the best results. We present 24 of the top 30 areas judged accurate by domain experts:\nmachine translation, natural language processing, word sense disambiguation, speech recognition, question answering, dependency parsing, information extraction, chinese word segmentation, semantic role labeling, information retrieval, entity recognition, word alignment, conditional random fields, maximum entropy, coreference resolution, machine learning, dialogue systems, textual entailment, natural language understanding, active learning, part-of-speech tagging, relation extraction, sentiment analysis, sense induction"

      "heading" : "4.2 Categorizing papers on the basis of application area",
      "text" : "From the first step, we obtain a pool of application areas and we have to assign individual papers to one of these areas. Individual papers from the entire corpus are categorized to their corresponding areas on the basis of two strategies – direct match and relevance as per the language models, defined for various areas (see Figure 1).\nDirect match: In the direct match approach, we search for an explicit string match between the title or abstract and one of the areas. One non-trivial task here is identifying the location and the text in the abstract of a paper. We achieve this by using handwritten rules [digit]?[”abstract”] upto [digit]?[”introduction”] (where the ”?”denotes that the section number and is optional), to match the portion of the paper between the abstract and the introduction. Also, we have converted the text to lower case during pre-processing. Subsequently, using the set of areas obtained from the previous step, we search if there is a direct match between any of these and the title. If the given title contains only one area name from the previous list, then the paper is assigned to that area. In case we do not find a match in the title, we check for a direct match with the abstract of the paper. If the abstract contains only one such matching area then the paper is categorized to that area. On the other hand, if the title or the abstract contains more than one direct match with the area set then we further use the language modeling approach to classify that paper. Language modeling for classification of area of individual paper: In this approach, we create a language model for each area, and classify a document into one of these areas based on the probability that the title and abstract of the document is generated from the language models of various areas.To create a language model for each area, we select the papers which could be classified on the basis of a single direct match. The titles and abstracts of all the papers belonging to one area are taken together to construct the language model of that area with the Jenilek-Mercer (JM) smoothing. A document not categorized using direct match is treated as a query, consisting of the words in its title and abstract. The Porter stemmer is used on the bagof-words for each area and the query. As validated by [28], the parameter λ for JM smoothing should be high for long queries, which is true in our case. After experimenting on a small set of sample of papers, we fixed λ to 0.7. Now, in our context, the prior probability P (d) for an application area, is proportional to the number of papers which were assigned to that area by a single direct match of either the title or the abstract. Hence, given a query paper q, the area which scores the highest P (d|q) = P (q|d)P (d) for the query (q) is assigned as the area for the given paper."

      "heading" : "4.3 Extracting the repertoire of techniques",
      "text" : "The central idea here is based on the notion of method papers: these are papers that introduce a novel technique or provide a toolkit in an area of computational linguistics. For instance, the paper introducing the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit is one such relevant example. The novel technique introduced or improved upon is a reason why method papers are cited. These papers are thus characterized by two features – one, they are expected to have been cited a number of times which is above some threshold (say k1) thus indicating that the technique introduced or improved upon is frequently used and second, the fraction of times they obtain their citations in the “methodology” section of other papers is above some threshold (atleast k2%), thereby, indicating that they are primarily “method papers”. We have set these thresholds by observing a large subset of papers of the ACL corpus. The values we chose to identify method papers are k1 = 15 and k2 = 50%. Identifying method papers: one non-trivial task in com-\ning up with the list of method papers is to identify the method section from the text of a research paper. For this, we searched the text with the pattern [digit][S] where S is a string containing some keywords like “methodology” ,“method”, “approach” or syntactic variations of these. The digit indicates the section number. This step help us identify as to which of the citations occur in the method section. Now, once the “method papers” are identified using the two thresholds above, we need to associate them with the techniques they are used for. For example, the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit paper will be cited whenever the citing paper uses the former’s part-of-speech tagging module, tokenizer module or the named-entity recognition module, although these are quite different techniques. Hence we need to associate or extract from the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit paper the techniques, part-of speech tagging, tokenization, named entity recognition, among other techniques.\nHere we make use of the fact that when the citing paper applies a technique from the cited paper, it cites that paper and also mentions the name of the technique in the citation context (i.e., the sentence where the citation is made). Our objective is to extract all the techniques a method paper is used for, from the citation context(s). In other words, given all the citation contexts for a particular “method paper”, we wish to identify all the specific techniques for which that method paper is used. We now describe the algorithm in detail. Step 1: As a first step, we need to identify the citations in the text of the paper. One example of a citation is: “(String et al., year)”. There are numerous forms in which the citations could be written. Sometimes the year is shortened to two digits or if there are only two authors, their names are separated by “and” and so on. Further, we had to take into account the possible errors in the text like missing parenthesis. We hand-crafted a set of regular expressions to match the citation format. We tested these on a small sample of 30 papers and augmented the set. The final set was used for extracting the citation contexts. Step 2: For every method paper in the corpora, we extract all its citation contexts when the citation is made in the method section. One observation we make is that the techniques are almost exclusively noun phrases in the citation context. We build a global vector of noun phrases across all citation contexts for all the method papers. The ith component of the vector is the raw count of the ith noun phrase, ordered lexicographically, over the method citations of the entire corpora. We consider this global vector as the ranked list of all the techniques used in the computational linguistics domain. Some of the top ranking noun phrases are depicted below.\npenn treebank, stanford parser, rate training, berkeley parser, machine translation, statistical machine translation, charniak parser, moses toolkit, word sense disambiguation, maximum entropy, ibm model, bleu score, perceptron algorithm, word alignment, stanford pos tagger, collins parser, natural language processing, bleu metric, coreference resolution, moses decoder, giza++ toolkit, brill tagger, tnt tagger,anaphora resolution, mst parser, ccg parser, malt parser, minimum error rate training"

We built a similar vector of these noun phrases where the ith component of the vector is the raw count of that noun phrase drawn from the global vector introduced in the previous section. If a particular noun phrase from the global vector is missing in the citation contexts for X, its weight is set to zero. Once this vector is created for method paper X, we simply take a dot product between this local vector of X and the global vector to get a ranked list of possible techniques for X. Now, we simply read off the top K techniques on this rank list as the techniques the method paper X is used for.\nHowever, note that since we have taken a dot product between the local and global noun phrase vectors, those noun phrases which occur frequently across almost all papers might wrongly turn up as a technique if it occurs even once in the local vector. Noun phrases such as “citation”, “previous work” and “recent work” are some typical examples of such occurrences that we found in our experiment. Thus, we maintain a stop-phrase list of noun phrases that commonly occur in the citation context but are not techniques. Further, we ignore the technique which exactly matches with, contains or is contained in the area since this is a redundant case. For example, for the application area ”Statistical Machine Translation”, we ignore the technique ”Machine Translation”. After this stage we were able to extract a list of top K techniques for each method paper."

      "text" : "First, we present the relative performances of the three schemes (in terms of precision) for creation of the ranked list, in Table 1. Since Scheme 3 gave the highest precision (assignments were judged by an expert) on the list of top-30 areas, we used this scheme for the creation of the ranked list in the subsequent stages.\nIn this part of the evaluation, we have a ranked list of potential areas in the computational linguistics domain extracted from the ACL corpora. We use standard precision-recall measures for the purpose of evaluation. However, note that, there is no easy way to measure the recall of the algorithm on the entire ACL corpora since all the possible areas in the corpus is not known a-priori. This is because the only way to construct a definitive list of all possible areas is to manually identify them from every individual paper in the corpus. However, it is relatively easy to measure the recall of our algorithm on a smaller subset. Therefore, we selected a random set of 200 research papers and manually identified each of their areas. 23 distinct areas were found from this smaller corpus by one domain expert. The areas found out manually were matched to the closest area from the pool of areas. This was done so that we can verify the set of areas returned by the algorithm without ambiguity. This set of areas is the ground-truth for our algorithm. Once this smaller corpus of 200 papers was created, we ran the k-gram discounting algorithm with thresholds (Scheme 3) to arrive at a set of areas. Among the 23 cases, 20 of the areas were successfully identified. Thus, the recall of our algorithm is 87 %.\nMeasurement of the precision of our algorithm was relatively straightforward. Measurement of precision can be done by manually judging what fraction of the top K areas are indeed genuine computational linguistics areas as judged by domain experts. The annotation was done by a domain expert in the following way: 1 if it is a true positive and 0 if it is a false positive. Table 6 notes the values of precision obtained for K = 25, 30, 50, 75 and 100 top application areas. As we can see, as the value of K increases the precision falls\nwhich is a witness to the fact that actual areas are ranked higher by our ranking methodology.\nWe also asked another domain expert to annotate the first 30 results independent of the first judge. Inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s kappa coefficient) was calculated and the value of κ came out to be 0.79.

The experiment is setup in the following way – for a randomly selected set of 30 papers we aggregate all their citation contexts from the method sections of the citing papers. The smaller corpus of 30 papers introduced or improved upon 26 distinct techniques, is judged by one domain expert.

Some of the interesting trends from the table 7 are listed below:\n• Dependency Parsing: New techniques (Malt parser, minimum spanning tree (MST) parser, etc.) came into existence in 2005 – 2009. In the next year bucket, these parsers overcome popularity of previous parsers such as Collin’s parser, Berkeley parser and are almost at par with Charniak parser. In addition, we observe that the Penn treebank is extensively used for dependency parsing across almost all time periods.\n• Machine Translation: We found that word alignment and inversion transduction grammar are popular techniques for machine translation across all time periods. Also, Bleu score has been a popular technique since its introduction in 2000 – 2004. Similarly, Moses toolkit and IBM model are both popular techniques across most time periods.\n• Sentiment Analysis: In this area, mutual information and word sense disambiguation are popular techniques for most of the time periods. Latent dirichlet allocation (introduced in 2003) found important use in sentiment analysis in 2005 – 2009. Also the spin model got popularity in 2005 – 2009.\n• Cross Lingual Textual Entailment: Distributional similarity and mutual information are important techniques and are popular in multiple time periods. Verb ocean gets popular in 2005 – 2009 and 2009 – 2013. It is also very interesting to note that machine translation is actually an important tool for this area and is very popular in 2005 – 2009. However, in 2010 – 2013 its popularity goes down. A probable explanation for this could be the introduction of techniques which perform cross-lingual textual entailment without machine translation - for example, FBK: Cross-Lingual Textual Entailment Without Translation [17].\n• Grammatical Error Correction: Techniques to address out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words have become important in recent times. Over the years, Collins parser got replaced by Charniak parser and finally by Berkeley parser. Penn treebank is an important dataset for this area."

      "heading" : "6.3 Evolution of major areas in top conferences",
      "text" : "We shortlisted two top conferences in the computational linguistics domain namely, Annual Meeting of the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL) and the International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING). We study 40 years of conference history. For each conference, 40 year time-period is divided into four 10-year buckets. Next, for each conference, we extract top ten most popular areas (based on citation counts) for each 10-year bucket. Figure 3 presents phrase clouds representing evolution of areas in these two conferences in comparison to the full AAN dataset itself. Some of the interesting observations from this analysis are:\n• Full AAN dataset: Here, we observe that while in the earlier decades, areas such as “semantic role labeling”, “evaluation of natural language” and “speech recognition” were dominant, they fade away in the recent decades. On the other hand, areas such as “machine translation” and “dependency parsing”, which were less prevalent in the earlier decades gain significant importance in the recent decades. We also see “sentiment analysis” as one of the major areas in the last decade.\n• ACL: In the earlier decades of this conference, one finds that the community is interested in areas like “linguistic knowledge sources” and “semantic role labeling.” Over the recent decades, however, the community seems to be more interested in areas such as “machine translation” and “dependency parsing”. Interestingly, in the time period 2005 – 2013, an upcoming area like“social media”is found to gain importance.\n• COLING: For this conference, we observe that in the earlier decades, areas like “lexical semantics” and “linguistic knowledge sources” were of interest to the community. However, in the recent years, areas like “machine translation”, “dependency parsing” and “bilingual lexicon extraction” have gained importance. An interesting observation here is that “semantic role labeling” has been all through a thrust area for this particular conference."

      "heading" : "7. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a novel information extraction system for scientific articles. The system extracts ranked list of all application areas in the computational linguistics domain. At a more granular level, it also extracts application area for a given paper. In addition, it extracts ranked list of all techniques as well as paperwise technique extraction. Finally, we construct a mapping from application areas to all the techniques. We evaluate our system with domain experts and prove that it performs reasonably well on both precision and recall. As a use case, we present an extensive analysis of temporal variation in popularity of the techniques for a given area. Some of the interesting observation that we make here are that the areas like “machine translation” and “dependency parsing” are on the rise of popularity while areas like “speech recognition”, “linguistic knowledge sources” and “evolution of natural language”\nare on the decline. In future, we plan to work on constructing a multi-level mapping table that maps application areas to techniques and further techniques to a set of parameters. For example, application area Machine Translation has Bleu score as one of its techniques. Bleu score is a algorithm that takes few input parameters. Changing these parameters will change the outcome of the score. Example of one such parameter is n, which represents the value of n for the n-grams.\nWe also plan to run the current system on a larger corpus of scientific articles. All our methods can be generalized to domains other than computational linguistics. Currently, we plan to extend the dataset to Microsoft academic research dataset (larger dataset) and a biomedical dataset (different domain). We also plan to study temporal characteristics of techniques for a given application area to observe if future predictions can be made for a technique - whether its popularity will increase or decrease in the years come."

With the exponential growth in research volumes, it has become difficult to keep track of the ever-growing number of application areas as well as the corresponding problem solving techniques. In this paper, we consider the computational linguistics domain and present a novel information extraction system that automatically constructs a pool of all application areas in this domain and appropriately links them with corresponding problem solving techniques. Further, we categorize individual research articles based on their application area and the techniques proposed/used in the article. k-gram based discounting method along with handwritten rules and bootstrapped pattern learning is employed to extract application areas. Subsequently, a language modelling approach is proposed to characterize each article based on its application area. Similarly, regular expressions and high-scoring noun phrases are used for the extraction of the problem solving techniques. We propose a greedy approach to characterize each article based on the techniques. Towards the end, we present a table representing the most frequent techniques adopted for a particular application area. Finally, we propose three use cases presenting an extensive temporal analysis of the usage of techniques and application areas.",
