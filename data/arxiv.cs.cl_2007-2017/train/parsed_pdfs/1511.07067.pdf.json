      "text" : "Language and vision are the two important interaction modalities for humans. Understanding and modeling the rich interplay between vision and language is thus one of the fundamental problems in artificial intelligence (AI). That is, AI is inherently multi-modal.\nLanguage modeling is an important problem in natural language processing (NLP). A language model estimates the likelihood of a word conditioned on other words in a sentence. There is a rich history of works which do n-gram based language modeling [17, 4]. The idea is that simple, count-based models trained on millions of sentences can give good results. However, in recent years, neural language models [3, 30] have been growing in popularity. Neural language models typically project raw one-hot encoded words into a vector space, and construct models on top to maxi-\nmize the log-likelihood of word occurrences. One popular choice for this vector space is the word2vec [31, 29] embedding. This embedding captures rich notions of semantic relatedness and compositionality between words [31]. For instance, it is possible to realize that Paris and France are related concepts by measuring similarity using these embeddings. Surprisingly, these embeddings also generalize to analogies. Thus, France - Paris + Berlin is very close to Germany. These embeddings seem to capture not only semantic relatedness but also how words are related. Interestingly, word2vec never receives supervision that Paris and France are related concepts or how they are related. The semantic relatedness is captured as an emergent property of the network training procedure.\nSince AI is a multi-modal problem, it could be beneficial\n1\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n07 06\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n2 N\nov 2\n01 5\nto model semantics as dictated by both text and vision. It is especially challenging to model fine-grained interactions between objects using only text. Consider the relations eating and stares at in Fig. 1. When reasoning using only text, it is difficult to realize that these relations could be semantically similar. However, by grounding the concepts into vision, we realize that these relations are more similar than it appears in text. Thus, visual grounding provides a complimentary notion of semantic relatedness to text. In this work, we aim to learn word embeddings to capture this grounding. Our experiments show that modeling such semantic relatedness is useful for a number of tasks in text that could benefit from visual reasoning.\nGrounding fine grained notions of semantic relatedness between words like eating and stare at into vision is a challenging problem. While recent years have seen tremendous progress in tasks like image classification [20], detection [13], semantic segmentation [24], action recognition [25], etc., modeling fine grained semantics of interactions between objects is still a challenging task. However, we observe that it is the semantics of the visual scene that matter for inferring the visually grounded semantic relatedness, and not the literal pixels (Fig. 1). We thus ground word embeddings using abstract scenes made from clipart. Abstract scenes give us access to a rich semantic feature space where the positions, pose, expressions, gaze, age etc. of objects are readily accessible [40, 41].\nOur model considers visual cues from abstract scenes as context for words. Given a set of words and associated images, we train to predict the visual grounding or context from pre-initialized word embeddings. We cluster the scenes to identify semantically similar visual concepts, which are then used as the visual context. The idea is to bring words with similar visual instantiations closer together, and push words with different visual instantiations farther. The clusters act as surrogate classes. Note that each surrogate class may have images belonging to concepts which are different in text, but are visually similar in the semantic clipart feature space. Since we predict a single context output given a set of input words, our model can be viewed as a multi-modal extension of the CBOW (Continuous Bag Of Words) [31] word2vec model.\nContributions: We propose a novel method Visual word2vec (vis-w2v) to learn visually grounded word embeddings. We use abstract scenes made from clipart to provide the grounding. We find that vis-w2v is useful for a number of tasks which are ostensibly in text, but can benefit from visual grounding, such as visual paraphrasing [23], common sense assertion classification [33], textbased image retrieval [15] etc. Visual paraphrasing [23] is the problem of determining whether two sentences describe the same underlying scene or not. Common sense assertion classification [33] is the task of modeling the plausibil-\nity of common sense assertions of the form (boy, eats, cake). Text-based image retrieval is the task of retrieving images by matching accompanying text with textual queries. We show consistent improvements over baseline word2vec models (w2v) in all experiments. In fact, on some tasks such as common sense assertion classification, our models surpass the state-of-the-art.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 discusses some related work on learning word embeddings, learning from visual abstraction, etc. Sec. 3 presents our approach. Sec. 4 describes the datasets we work with. We provide experimental details in Sec. 5 and results in Sec. 6."

      "heading" : "2. Related Work",
      "text" : "We first discuss related work in learning word embeddings. We then explore other works which learn with surrogate supervision. We then look at previous work on learning from visual abstractions and on relevant work at the intersection of language and vision.\nWord Embeddings: Neural network based word embeddings [31, 6] have gained a lot of popularity in recent times. These embeddings are learnt offline and then typically fed into a multi-layer Neural Network Language Model [3, 30]. Similar to those approaches, we learn word embeddings from text offline, and refine them to predict visual context for vis-w2v. Xu et al. [39] use visual cues to improve the w2v representation by predicting global visual context using fc7 features from real images. We want to model fine grained semantics using abstract scenes while their focus is on capturing appearance cues. Since dogs and cats look different, their work attempts to separate them in the word embedding space. Other works use word embeddings as parts of larger systems for various tasks such as image retrieval [18], image captioning [38, 18], etc. These multimodal embeddings capture regularities like compositional structure between images and words (attributes). Thus, in this multi-modal embedding space, “image of blue car” - “blue” + “red” gives a vector close to “image of red car”. In contrast, we want to learn complex semantic relatedness for words using abstract scenes, i.e., our embeddings themselves are unimodal. For example, we want to learn that that eating and staring at are related, or that placed in and decorated on are (visually) similar.\nSurrogate Classification: There has been a lot of recent work on learning with surrogate labels due to interest in unsupervised representation learning. Previous works have used surrogate labels to learn image features [9, 7]. In contrast, we are interested in augmenting word embeddings with visual semantics. Previous works have created surrogate labels using data transformations [9] or sampling [7]. We create semantic surrogate labels by clustering images in\nthe abstract scenes feature space.\nLearning from Visual Abstraction: There is a lot of recent literature on learning from visual abstractions for a variety of high-level scene understanding tasks. Zitnick et al. [41, 40] learn the importance of various visual features (occurrence, co-occurrence, expression, gaze, etc.) in determining the meaning or semantics of a scene. [42] and [10] learn the visual interpretation of sentences and the dynamics of objects in temporal abstract scenes respectively. Antol et al. [2] learn models of fine-grained interactions between pairs of people using visual abstractions. Lin and Parikh [23] “imagine” abstract scenes corresponding to text, and use the common sense depicted in these imagined scenes to solve textual tasks such as fill-in-the-blanks and paraphrasing. Vedantam et al. [33] classify common sense assertions as plausible or not by using textual and visual cues. In this work, we experiment with the tasks of [23] and [33], which are two tasks in text that could benefit from visual grounding. Interestingly, by learning vis-w2v, we eliminate the need for visual signal at test time, i.e. the visual grounding captured in our word embeddings suffices.\nLanguage, Vision and Common Sense: Recent work has explored many problems at the intersection of language and vision. We study one such application of text-based image retrieval with our vis-w2v model (Sec. 4). There have been recent breakthroughs in tasks like image captioning [16, 5, 8, 38, 28, 19, 14, 32, 21], video description [8, 35], visual question answering [1, 11, 27, 34, 26, 12], aligning text and vision [16, 18], etc. In contrast to these works, we are interested in tasks which are ostensibly in text, but could benefit from visual cues. [36, 33] study one such problem of assessing the plausibility of common sense assertions. We evaluate our vis-w2v model on the common sense assertion classification task of [33]. We show that our vis-w2v model yields improvements over their joint text + vision model. In contrast to their model, our vis-w2v model implicitly captures visual cues, removing the need for abstract scenes at test time."

      "heading" : "3. Approach",
      "text" : "Recall that our vis-w2v model grounds word embeddings into vision by treating vision as context. We first explain our experimental setup briefly. We then describe our procedure for clustering to get surrogate semantic labels, which are used as context by our model. We then describe our vis-w2v model architecture and make connections to w2v models.\nSetup: We need a multi-modal training set in order to train vis-w2v. That is, we need a set of pairs of visual scenes and associated text D = {(v, w)}d. We extract features from the image and denote the feature vector as v while w\nrefers to the set of words associated with the image. Our model is flexible and can accept text in a variety of forms such as full sentences or tuples of the form (Primary Object, Relation, Secondary Object). At each step in training, we select a window Sw ⊆ w to fine-tune the model. The choice of these windows is a design parameter depending upon the task. It could include all of w (e.g., in the case of concise tuples) or a subset of the words (e.g., in the case of windowbased representations on entire sentences). We next explain our clustering step that gives us the visual context for words.\nClustering: We group images into clusters in order to discover similarities in the visual feature space to use as surrogate labels for training vis-w2v. The surrogate labels serve the role of visual context for words. Since we want to learn fine-grained semantic relatedness between concepts from vision (Fig. 1), the feature space should capture finegrained details such as pose, expressions, attributes, interactions between objects, etc. We thus use the features from abstract scenes [33, 23] that are trivially fully annotated with a range of semantics. We cluster abstract images using Kmeans to obtain the surrogate labels1. K is a model parameter, kept constant during training. Clustering gives us a grouping function G(v) that assigns surrogate labels to each v, i.e., G maps all the visual features to one of K class labels {1,2, · · · ,K}.\nModel: Our vis-w2v model (Fig. 2) is a neural network that accepts as input a set of words Sw and a visual feature instance v. Each of the words wi ∈ Sw is represented via a one-hot encoding. A one-hot encoding enumerates over the set of words in a vocabulary (NV ) and places a 1 at the index corresponding to the given word. This one-hot encoded\n1Alternatively, one could regress directly to the feature values v. However, our experiments showed clustering performs better.\ninput is transformed using inner weight matrix WI of size NV ×NH that connects the input layer to the hidden layer, where the hidden layer has a dimension of NH . Intuitively, NH decides the representative capacity of the embedding. Consider an input one-hot encoded word wi whose jth index is set to 1. Since wi is one-hot encoded, the hidden activation for this word (Hwi ) is a row in the weight matrix W jI , i.e., Hwi = W j I . The resultant hidden activation H would then be the average of individual hidden activations Hwi as WI is shared among all the words Sw, i.e.,:\nH = 1 |Sw| ∑\nwi∈Sw⊆w\nHwi (1)\nNote that the set of words Sw admits a wide variety of choices ranging from full sentence descriptions to words in primary, relation, or secondary object phrases. This allows us to train different versions of vis-w2v depending upon the task at hand.\nGiven the hidden activations H , we multiply it with an output weight matrix WO of size NH ×NK , where NK is the number of surrogate classes as explained earlier. We normalize the output activations O = H ×WO to form a distribution using the softmax function. Given the softmax outputs, we minimize the negative log-likelihood of the correct (surrogate) class conditioned on the input words:\nmin WI ,WO\n− logP (G(v)|Sw,WI ,WO) (2)\nWe use standard backpropagation techniques to optimize this objective function via stochastic gradient descent. We perform training until the performance on a held-out validation set saturates. While the training is task agnostic, and only needs access to the visual context, the validation performance may be calculated on a task of interest. We consider tasks such as common sense assertion classification, visual paraphrasing, and text-based image retrieval in this work. The learning rates for the layers are set to 0.01.\nConnections to w2v: Our model has some connections to the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) w2v models. The CBOW w2v objective maximizes the likelihood P (w′|Sw,WI ,WO) for a word w′ and its context Sw. On the other hand, we maximize the likelihood of the visual context given a set of words Sw (Eq. 2).\nFinetuning: We initialize the network input-to-hidden layer parameters WI with those from training w2v on large text corpora. The hidden-to-output layer parameters are initialized randomly. Using w2v is advantageous for us in two ways: i) w2v embeddings have been shown to capture rich semantics and generalize to a large number of tasks in text. Thus, they provide an excellent starting point to finetune the embeddings to account for visual similarity as well. ii) Training on a large corpus gives us good coverage in terms\nof the vocabulary. Further, since the gradients during backward propagation only affect parameters / embeddings for words seen during training, one can view vis-w2v as augmenting w2v with visual information when available. For other words, we retain the rich amount of non-visual information already present in it2. Indeed, we find that the random initialization does not perform as well as initialization with w2v when training vis-w2v."

      "text" : "We study the common sense (CS) assertion classification task introduced by Vedantam et al. [33]. Given common sense tuples of the form (primary object or P, relation or R, secondary object or S) e.g. (boy, eats, cake), the task is to classify it as plausible or not. The CS dataset contains 14,332 TEST assertions (spanning 203 relations) out of which 37% are plausible, as indicated by human annotations. These TEST assertions are extracted from the MSCOCO dataset [22], which contains real images and captions. Thus the TEST set contains common sense assertions about the real world. [33] approach the task by constructing a multi-modal similarity function between TEST assertions whose plausibility is to be evaluated, and TRAIN assertions that are known to be plausible. The TRAIN dataset contains 4260 abstract scenes made from clipart depicting 213 relations between various objects (20 scenes per relation). Each scene is also annotated with one tuple that names the primary object, relation, and secondary object depicted in the scene. Features describing the interaction between objects such as relative location, pose, absolute location, etc., are obtained from authors [33]. We use this dataset and the provided features to learn vis-w2v. More details of their features can be found in the appendix. We use their VAL set (14,548 assertions) to pick the number of clusters for training. Since the dataset contains tuples of the form (P, R, S), we explore learning visual word2vec with separate models for each, and a shared model irrespective of the word being P, R, or S.\n2We verified empirically that this does not cause ‘calibration’ issues. Specifically, given a pair of words where one word was refined using visual information but the other was not (unseen during training), using vis-w2v for the former and w2v for the latter when computing similarities between the two outperforms using w2v for both."

For all applications (Sec. 4), we train vis-w2v on the corresponding dataset. vis-w2v-wiki are vis-w2v embeddings learnt using w2v-wiki as a starting point, while vis-w2v-coco are the vis-w2v embeddings learnt using w2v-coco as the starting point.

We handle tuple elements, etc. P, R or S, with more than one word by placing each word in a separate window (i.e. |Sw| = 1). For instance, the element lay next to is trained by predicting the associated visual context thrice with lay, next and to as inputs. We find an increase of 2.6% with our best vis-w2v-coco model over the w2v-coco model used in [33].

Interestingly, both models use the same training and validation data, which suggests that our vis-w2v model captures the grounding better than their multi-modal text + visual similarity model.

In terms of shared models alone, we achieve a gain in performance of 2.3% over the w2v-coco model of [33], whose textual models are all shared.\nWhat Does Clustering Capture? We next visualize the semantics captured by the initial clustering step which gives us the surrogate labels to train on. We remind the reader that we use the semantically rich abstract scenes feature space. As explained in Sec. 4, our visual features in this experiment focus on interactions between primary and secondary objects in the scene [33], and capture semantics of location, pose, relative location, expression, gaze etc. To visualize the semantic relatedness captured by clustering, we pick some relations and display other relations that co-occur the most with it in the same cluster (Fig. 4). Interestingly, words like prepare to cut, hold, give occur often with stare at. Thus, we realize that when we prepare to cut something, we also tend to stare at it. Reasoning about such notions of semantic relatedness using purely textual cues would be prohibitively difficult. We provide more examples in the appendix."

We show the gains obtained by using context sizes of entire description, single sentence, 5 words, and single word respectively. We find that description level context windows and sentence level context windows give equal gains. However, performance tapers off as we reduce the context to 5 words (0.6% gain) and a single word (0.1% gain). This is intuitive, since VP requires us to reason about entire scenes to determine if the two descriptions are paraphrases.

We refer to this model as vis-w2v4K.\nWe report the gains in performance over w2v baselines\n5We experimented with other choices but found this works best.\nin both scenario 1) and 2) for the common sense task. We find that using real images gives a best-case performance of 73.7% starting from w2v-coco for vis-w2v80K (as compared to 74.8% using CS TRAIN abstract scenes). For vis-w2v4K-coco, the performance on the validation actually goes down during training. If we train vis-w2v4K starting with generic text based w2v-wiki, we get a performance of 70.8% (as compared to 74.2% using CS TRAIN abstract scenes). This shows that abstract scenes are better at visual grounding as compared to real images, due to their rich semantic features."

      "text" : "Antol et al. [2] have studied generalization of classification models learnt on abstract scenes to real images. The idea is to transfer fine-grained concepts that are easier to learn in the fully-annotated abstract domain to tasks in the real domain. Our work attempts to solve the same problem in spirit. Our vis-w2v embeddings can be viewed as a way to transfer knowledge learnt in the abstract domain to the real domain, such as common sense assertion classification. While the abstract and real domains differ in pixels, they have common underlying semantics. vis-w2v embeddings can thus form the bridge between the abstract and real domains.\nWe next discuss some considerations in the design of the model. A possible design choice when learning embeddings could have been to construct a triplet loss function, where the similarity between a tuple and a pair of visual instances can be specified. That is, given a textual instance A, and two images B and C, one could construct a loss that enforces sim(A,B) >= sim(A,C), and learn joint embeddings for words and images. However, since we want to learn hidden semantic relatedness (e.g., “eating”, “stare at”), there is no explicit supervision available at train time on which images and words should be related. Although the visual scenes and associated text inherently provide information about related words, they do not capture the unrelatedness between words, i.e., we do not have negatives to help us learn the semantics. Thus, we discover these concepts in the semantic visual feature space and finetune generic word embeddings to respect the discovered visual relationships.\nAnother view of our vis-w2v approach is in terms of data augmentation. It is easy to realize that with infinite text data describing scenes, distributional semantics of w2v would capture all possible visual patterns as well. For instance, in Fig. 1, if the statements “girl eating ice cream” and “girl stares at ice cream” were both present in a textual corpus, it would be trivial to realize their semantic relatedness using a w2v-like approach. In this sense, there is nothing special about the visual grounding, except as a way to learn complimentary concepts while making efficient use of data. Thus, the visual grounding can be seen as augment-\ning textual data. In other words, a picture could literally be worth a 1000 words in our case."

      "text" : "We learn visually grounded word embeddings named vis-w2v from abstract scenes and associated text. Abstract scenes, being trivially fully annotated, give us access to a rich semantic feature space. We leverage this feature space to learn visually grounded notions of semantic relatedness between words that would be difficult to capture using text alone and using real images. We demonstrate the visual grounding captured by our model on three applications that are in text, but benefit from visual cues: 1) common sense assertion classification, 2) visual paraphrasing, and 3) text-based image retrieval. Our method outperforms w2v baselines on all the tasks. Our method can be viewed as a modality to transfer knowledge from the abstract scenes domain to the real domain via text. All our datasets, code, and vis-w2v embeddings will be available for public use.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported in part by the The Paul G.

A)\n• Visual paraphrasing (Sec. B)\n• Text-based image retrieval (Sec. C)\nSpecifically, we study the affect of various hyperparameters like number of surrogate labels (K), number of hidden layer nodes (NH ), etc., on the performance of both vis-w2v-coco and vis-w2v-wiki. We remind the reader that vis-w2v-coco models are initialized with w2v learnt on visual text, i.e., MSCOCO captions in our case while vis-w2v-wiki models are initialized with w2v learnt on generic Wikipedia text. We also show few visualizations and examples to qualitatively illustrate why vis-w2v performs better in these tasks that are ostentatiously in text, but benefit from visual cues. We conclude by presenting the results of training on real images (Sec. D)."

      "heading" : "A. Common Sense Assertion Classification",
      "text" : "Recall that the common sense assertion classification task [33] is to determine if a tuple of the form (primary object or P, relation or R, secondary object or S) is plausible or not. In this section, we first describe the abstract visual features used by [33]. We follow it with results for vis-w2v-coco, both shared and separate models, by varying the number of surrogate classesK. We next discuss the effect of number of hidden units NH which can be seen as the complexity of the model. We then vary the amount of training data and study performance of vis-w2v-coco. Learning separate word embeddings for each of these specific roles, i.e., P, R or S results in separate models while learning single embeddings for all of them together gives us shared models. Additionally, we also perform and report similar studies for vis-w2v-wiki. Finally, we visualize the clusters learnt for the common sense task through word clouds, similar to Fig. 4 in the main paper.\nA.1. Abstract Visual Features\nWe describe the features extracted from abstract scenes for the task of common sense assertion classification. Our visual features are essentially the same as those used by [33]: a) Features corresponding to primary and secondary object, i.e., P and S respectively. These include type (category ID and instance ID), absolute location modeled via Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), orientation, attributes and poses for both P and S present in the scene. We use Gaussian Mixture at hands and foot locations to model pose, measuring relative positions and joint locations. Human attributes are age (5 discrete values), skin color (3 discrete\nvalues) and gender (2 discrete values). Animals have 5 discrete poses. Human pose features are constructed using keypoint locations. b) Features corresponding to relative location of P and S, once again modeled using Gaussian Mixture Models. These features are normalized by the flip and depth of the primary object, which results in the features being asymmetric. We compute these with respect to both P and S to make the features symmetric. c) Features related to the presence of other objects in the scene, i.e., category ID and instance ID for all the other objects. Overall the feature vector is of dimension 1222.\nA.2. Varying number of clusters K\nIntuition: We cluster the images in the semantic clipart feature space to get surrogate labels. We use these labels as visual context, and predict them using words to enforce visual grounding. Hence, we study the influence of the number of surrogate classes relative to the number of images. This is indicative of how coarse/detailed the visual grounding for a task needs to be.\nSetup: We train vis-w2v models by clustering visual features with and without dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), giving us Orig and PCA settings, respectively. Notice that each of the elements of tuples, i.e., P, R or S could have multiple words, e.g., lay next to. We handle these in two ways: a) Place each of the words in separate windows and predict the visual context repeatedly. Here, we train by predicting the same visual context for lay, next, to thrice. This gives us the Words setting. b) Place all the words in a single window and predict the visual context for the entire element only once. This gives the Phrases setting. We explore the cross product space of settings a) and b). PCA/Phrases (red in Fig. 6) refers to the model trained by clustering the dimensionality reduced visual features and handling multi-word elements by including them in a single window. We vary the number of surrogate classes from 15 to 35 in steps of 5, re-train vis-w2v for each K, and report the accuracy on the common sense task. The number of hidden units NH is kept fixed to 200 to be comparable to the text-only baseline reported in [33]. Fig. 6 shows the performance on the common sense task as K varies for both shared and separate models in four possible configurations each, as described above.\nObservations:\n• As K varies, the performance for both shared and separate models increases initially and then either saturates or decreases. For a given dataset, low values of K result in the visual context being too coarse to learn the visual grounding. On the other hand, K being too high results in clusters which do not capture visual semantic related-\nness. We found the best model to have around 25 clusters in both the cases.\n• Words models perform better than Phrases models in both cases. Common sense task involves reasoning about the specific role (P, R or S) each word plays. For example, (man, eats, sandwich) is plausible while (sandwich, eats, sandwich) or (man, sandwich, eats) is not. Potentially, vis-w2v could learn these roles in addition to the learning semantic relatedness between the words. This explains why separate models perform better than shared models, and Words outperform Phrases setting.\n• For lower K, PCA models dominate over Orig models while the latter outperforms as K increases. As low values of K correspond to coarse visual information, surrogate classes in PCA models could be of better quality and thus help in learning the visual semantics.\nA.3. Varying number of hidden units NH\nIntuition: One of the model parameters for our vis-w2v is the number of hidden units NH . This can be seen as the capacity of the model. We vary NH while keeping the other factors constant during training to study its affect on performance of the vis-w2v model.\nSetup: To understand the role of NH , we consider two vis-w2v models trained separately with K set to 10 and 25 respectively. Additionally, both of these are separate models with Orig/Words configuration (see Sec. A.2). We particularly choose these two settings as the former is trained with a very coarse visual semantic information while the latter is the best performing model. Note that as [33] fix the number of hidden units to 200 in their evaluation, we cannot directly compare the performance to their baseline. We, therefore, recompute the baselines for each value of NH ∈ {20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 400} and use it to compare our two models, as shown in Fig. 8.\nObservations: Models of low complexity, i.e., low values of NH , perform the worst. This could be due to the inherent limitation of low NH to capture the semantics, even for w2v. On the other hand, high complexity models also perform poorly, although better than the low complexity models. The number of parameters to be learnt, i.e. WI and WO, increase linearly with NH . Therefore, for a finite amount of training data, models of high complexity tend to overfit resulting in drop in performance on an unseen test set. The baseline w2v models also follow a similar trend. It is interesting to note that the improvement of vis-w2v over w2v for less complex models (smaller NH ) is at 5.32% (for NH = 20) as compared to 2.6% (for NH = 200). In other words, lower complexity models benefit more from the vis-w2v enforced visual grounding. In\nfact, vis-w2v of low complexity (NH ,K) = (20, 25), outperforms the best w2v baseline across all possible settings of model parameters. This provides a strong evidence for the usefulness of visually grounding word embeddings in capturing visually-grounded semantics better.\nA.4. Varying size of training data\nIntuition: We next study how varying the size of the training data affects performance of the model. The idea is to\nanalyze whether more data about relations would help the task, or more data per relation would help the task.\nSetup: We remind the reader that vis-w2v for common sense task is trained on CS TRAIN dataset that contains 4260 abstract scenes made from clipart depicting 213 relations between various objects (20 scenes per relation). We identify two parameters: the number of relations nR and the number of abstract scenes per relation nT . Therefore, CS TRAIN dataset originally has (nT , nR) = (20, 213). We\nvary the training data size in two ways: a) Fix nR = 213 and vary nT ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}. b) Fix nT = 20 and vary nR in steps of 20 from 20 to 213. These cases denote two specific situations–the former limits the model in terms of how much it knows about each relation, i.e. its depth, keeping the number of relations, i.e. its breadth, constant; while the latter limits the model in terms of how many relations it knows, i.e., it limits the breadth keeping the depth constant. Throughout this study, we select the best performing vis-w2v model with (K,NH) = (25, 200) in the Orig/Words configuration. Fig. 7a shows the performance on the common sense task when nR is fixed while Fig. 7b is the performance when nT is fixed.\nObservations: The performance increases with the increasing size of training data in both the situations when nT and nR is fixed. However, the performance saturates in the former case while it increases with almost a linear rate in the latter. This shows that breadth helps more than the depth in learning visual semantics. In other words, training with more relations and fewer scenes per relation\nis more beneficial than training with fewer relations and more scenes per relation. To illustrate this, consider performance with approximately around half the size of the original CS TRAIN dataset. In the former case, it corresponds to 73.5% at (nT , nR) = (10, 213) while 70.6% at (nT , nR) = (20, 100) in the latter. Therefore, we conclude that the model learns semantics better with more concepts (relations) over more instances (abstract scenes) per concept.\nA.5. Cluster Visualizations\nWe show the cluster visualizations for a randomly sampled set of relations from the CS VAL set (Fig. 9). As in the main paper (Fig. 4), we analyze how frequently two relations co-occur in the same clusters. Interestingly, relations like drink from co-occur with relations like blow out and bite into which all involve action with a person’s mouth.\nB. Visual Paraphrasing\nThe Visual Paraphrasing (VP) task [23] is to classify whether a pair of textual descriptions are paraphrases of each other. These descriptions have three sentence each. Table 4 presents results on VP for various settings of the model that are described below.\nModel settings: We vary the number of hidden units NH ∈ {50, 100, 200} for both vis-w2v-coco and vis-w2v-wiki models. We also vary our context window size to include entire description (Descs), individual sentences (Sents), window of size 5 (Winds) and individual words (Words). As described in Sec. A.2, we also have Orig and PCA settings.\nObservations: From Table 4, we see improvements over the text baseline [23]. In general, PCA configuration outperforms Orig for low complexity models (NH = 50). Using entire description or sentences as the context window gives almost the same gains, while performs drops when smaller context windows are used (Winds and Words). As VP is a sentence level task where one needs to reason about the entire sentence to determine whether the given descriptions are paraphrases, these results are intuitive."

Each of the tuples entered in the text-boxes is treated as the query for text-based image retrieval.\nSome qualitative examples of success and failure cases of vis-w2v-wiki with respect to w2v-wiki are shown in Fig. 11.

Each image has around 5 captions giving us a total of around 390k captions to train. We call vis-w2v trained on this dataset as vis-w2v80k. b) We randomly select 213 relations from VAL set and collect 20 real images from MSCOCO and their corresponding tuples. This would give us 4260 real images with tuples, depicting the 213 CS VAL relations. We refer to this model as vis-w2v4k.\nWe first train vis-w2v80k with NH = 200 and\nuse the fc7 features as is, i.e. without PCA, in the Sents configuration (see Sec. B). Further, to investigate the complementarity between visual semantics learnt from real and visual scenes, we initialize vis-w2v-coco with vis-w2v-coco80k, i.e., we learn the visual semantics from the real scenes and train again to learn from abstract scenes. Table 5 shows the results for vis-w2v-coco80k, varying the number of surrogate classes K.\nWe then learn vis-w2v4k with NH = 200 in the Orig/Words setting (see Sec. A). We observe that the performance on the validation set reduces for vis-w2v-coco4k. Table 6 summarizes the results for vis-w2v-wiki4k.\nObservations: From Table 5 and Table 6, we see that there\nare indeed improvements over the text baseline of w2v. The complementarity results (Table 5) show that abstract scenes help us ground word embeddings through semantics complementary to those learnt from real images. Comparing the improvements from real images (best AP of 73.7%) to those from abstract scenes (best AP of 74.8%), we see that that abstract visual features capture visual semantics better than real images for this task. It if often difficult to capture localized semantics in the case of real images. For instance, extracting semantic features of just the primary and secondary objects given a real image, is indeed a challenging detection problem in vision. On the other hand, abstract scene offer these fine-grained semantics features therefore making them an ideal for visually grounding word embeddings."

While word embeddings trained using text have been extremely successful, they cannot uncover notions of semantic relatedness implicit in our visual world. For instance, visual grounding can help us realize that concepts like eating and staring at are related, since when people are eating something, they also tend to stare at the food. Grounding a rich variety of relations like eating and stare at in vision is a challenging task, despite recent progress in vision. We realize the visual grounding for words depends on the semantics of our visual world, and not the literal pixels. We thus use abstract scenes created from clipart to provide the visual grounding. We find that the embeddings we learn capture fine-grained visually grounded notions of semantic relatedness. We show improvements over text only word embeddings (word2vec) on three tasks: common-sense assertion classification, visual paraphrasing and text-based image retrieval. Our code and datasets will be available online.",
