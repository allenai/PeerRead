      "text" : "It is widely acknowledged that the concept of agency provides a convenient and powerful abstraction to describe complex software entities acting with a certain degree of autonomy to accomplish tasks, often on behalf of a user (Wooldridge, 2002). An agent in this context is understood as a software component with capabilities such as reacting, planning and (inter) acting to achieve its goals in the environment in which it is situated. In this paper, we present a model of agency, called KGP (Knowledge, Goals and Plan). The model is hierarchical and highly modular, allowing independent specifications of a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, used to equip an agent with intelligent decision making and adaptive behaviour. The model is particularly suited to open, dynamic environments where the agents have to adapt to changes in their environment and they have to function in circumstances where information is incomplete.\nc©2008 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nThe development of the KGP model was originally motivated by the existing gap between modal logic specifications (Rao & Georgeff, 1991) of BDI agents (Bratman, Israel, & Pollack, 1988) and their implementation (for example see the issues raised by Rao, 1996). Another motivation for the development of KGP comes from our participation in the SOCS project (SOCS, 2007), where we had the need for an agent model that satisfies several requirements. More specifically, we aimed at an agent model that was rich enough to allow intelligent, adaptive and heterogeneous behaviour, formal so that it could lent itself well to formal analysis, and implementable in such a way that the implementation was sufficiently close to the formal specification to allow verification. Although several models of agency have been proposed, none satisfies all of the above requirements at once.\nTo bridge the gap between specification and implementation the KGP model is based on computational logic (CL). The focus of the work is to extend and synthesise a number of useful computational logic techniques to produce formal and executable specifications of agents. For this purpose, the model integrates abductive logic programming (ALP) (Kakas, Kowalski, & Toni, 1992), logic programming with priorities (Kakas, Mancarella, & Dung, 1994; Prakken & Sartor, 1997) and constraint logic programming (Jaffar & Maher, 1994). Each of these techniques has been explored in its own right, but their modular integration within the KGP model explores extensions of each, as well as providing the high level agent reasoning capabilities.\nThe KGP model provides a hierarchical architecture for agents. It specifies a collection of modular knowledge bases, each formalised in CL. These knowledge bases support a collection of reasoning capabilities, such as planning, reactivity, and goal decision, all of which are given formal specifications. The model also includes a specification of physical capabilities, comprising of sensing and actuating. The capabilities are utilised within transitions, that model how the state of the agent changes as a result of its reasoning, sensing and acting. Transitions use selection operators providing them with inputs. A control component, called cycle theory, also formalised in CL, specifies in what order the transitions are executed, depending on the environment, the state of the agent, and the preferences of the agent. The cycle theory takes the agent control beyond the one-size-fits-all approach used by most agent models, and allows us to specify agents with different preferences and profiles of behaviour (Sadri & Toni, 2005). In particular, whereas the majority of existing agent models rely upon an “observe-plan-act”, by means of our cycle theory we can model behaviours such as “observe-revise goals-plan–act” or “observe-plan-sense action preconditions-act” or “observe-plan-act-plan-act”. We provide one example of cycle theory, that we refer to as normal, allowing all behaviours above depending on different circumstances (the environment in which the agent is situated and its preferences). Note also that, with respect to other agent models, the KGP model allows agents to revise their goals during their life-time, and observing the environment according to two modalities: active and passive observation.\nAn agent built with a KGP architecture dynamically determines its goals, plans (partially) how to achieve the goals, interleaves planning with action executions and with making observations in the environment and receiving any messages from other agents, adapts its goals and plans to any new information it receives, and any changes it observes, and generates appropriate reactions.\nA number of publications have already described aspects of (an initial version of) the KGP agents. A precursor of the overall model has been described by Kakas, Mancarella,\nSadri, Stathis, and Toni (2004b), its planning component has been presented by Mancarella, Sadri, Terreni, and Toni (2004), its cycle theory has been developed by Kakas, Mancarella, Sadri, Stathis, and Toni (2004a) and its implementation has been discussed by Stathis et al. (2004), by Yip, Forth, Stathis, and Kakas (2005), and by Bracciali, Endriss, Demetriou, Kakas, Lu, and Stathis (2006). In this paper, we provide the full formal specification of all the components of the KGP model, thus offering the complete technical account of KGP in one place. In providing this full formal specification, we have adjusted and further developed the model. In particular, the notion of state and its definition is novel, the reasoning capabilities have been simplified and some have been added, the physical capabilities have been extended (to include actuating) and formally defined, the transitions and the selection operators have been formally defined in full.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we give an outline of the model and then review the background information necessary for the full description. In Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7, respectively, we describe the internal state of KGP agents, their reasoning and physical capabilities, and their transitions. In Section 8 we describe the selection operators which are then used in the cycle theory which is described in Section 9. Following the detailed description of KGP agents we illustrate the model by a series of examples in Section 10, and then compare the model with others in the literature in Section 11. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 12."

      "heading" : "2.5 Cycle and Selection Operators",
      "text" : "The behaviour of an agent is given by the application of transitions in sequences, repeatedly changing the state of the agent. These sequences are not determined by fixed cycles of behaviour, as in conventional agent architectures, but rather by reasoning with cycle theories. Cycle theories define preference policies over the order of application of transitions, which may depend on the environment and the internal state of an agent. They rely upon the use of selection operators for detecting which transitions are enabled and what their inputs should be, as follows:\n• action selection for inputs to AE; this selection operator uses the Temporal Reasoning and Constraint Solving capabilities;\n• goal selection for inputs to PI; this selection operator uses the Temporal Reasoning and Constraint Solving capabilities;\n• effect selection for inputs to AOI; this selection operator uses the Identification of Effect reasoning capability;\n• precondition selection for inputs to SI; this selection operator uses the Identification of Preconditions, Temporal Reasoning and Constraint Solving capabilities;\nThe provision of a declarative control for agents in the form of cycle theories is a highly novel feature of the model, which could, in principle, be imported into other agent systems. In the concrete realisation of the KGP model we provide in this paper, we have chosen to realise cycle theories in the same framework of logic programming with priorities and constraints (see Section 3.3) that we also use for Goal Decision.\nSome of the relationships between the capabilities, transitions and the selection operators are summarised in Tables 2.5 and 2 below. Table 2.5 indicates which capabilities (rows) are used by which transitions and selection operators. Table 2 indicates which selection operators are used to compute possible inputs for which transitions in the cycle theory.\nBefore we provide these components, though, we introduce below informally a scenario and some examples that will be used to illustrate the technical details of the KGP agent\nmodel throughout the paper. A full, formal presentation of these as well as additional examples will be given throughout the paper and in Section 10."

      "text" : "We draw all our examples from a ubiquitous computing scenario that we call the San Vincenzo scenario, presented by de Bruijn and Stathis (2003) and summarised as follows. A businessman travels for work purposes to Italy and, in order to make his trip easier, carries a personal communicator, namely a device that is a hybrid between a mobile phone and a PDA. This device is the businessman’s KGP agent. This agent can be considered as a personal service agent (Mamdani, Pitt, & Stathis, 1999) (or psa for short) because it provides proactive information management and flexible connectivity to smart services available in the global environment within which the businessman travels within."

      "text" : "The businessman’s psa requests from a ‘San Vincenzo Station’ agent, svs, the arrival time of the train tr01 from Rome. As svs does not have this information it answers with a refusal. Then later, svs receives information of the arrival time of the tr01 train from a ‘Central Office’ agent, co. When the psa requests the arrival time of tr01 again, svs will accept the request and provide the information.\nThis first example requires one to use the Reactivity capability to model rules of interaction and the RE transition (a) to achieve interaction amongst agents, and (b) to specify dynamic adjustments of the agent’s behaviour to changes, allowing different reactions to the same request, depending on the current situation of the agent. Here, the interaction is a form of negotiation of resources amongst agents, where resources are items of information. Thus, the current situation of the agents amounts to what resources/information the agents currently own.\nThis example also requires the combination of transitions RE, POI, and AE to achieve the expected agents’ behaviours, as follows:\n1. psa makes the initial request by applying AE\n2. svs becomes aware of this request by performing POI (and changing its KB0 accordingly)\n3. svs decides to reply with a refusal by performing RE (and adding the corresponding action to its plan in F)\n4. svs utters the refusal by performing AE\n5. svs becomes aware, by POI, of the arrival time (modifying its KB0 accordingly)\n6. psa makes the second request by applying AE again\n7. svs decides to reply with the requested information by performing RE (and adding the corresponding action to its plan in F) and communicates the information by performing AE.\nThis sequence of transitions is given by the so-called normal cycle theory that we will see in Section 9."

      "text" : "In preparation of the businessman’s next trip, his psa aims at getting a plane ticket from Madrid to Denver as well as obtaining a visa to the USA. One possible way to buy plane tickets is over the internet. Buying tickets this way is usually possible, but not to all destinations (depending on whether the airlines flying to the destinations sell tickets over the internet or not) and not without an internet connection. The psa does not currently have the connection, nor the information that Denver is indeed a destination for which tickets can be bought online. It plans to buy the ticket over the internet nonetheless, conditionally, but checks the conditions before executing the planned action. After successfully buying the ticket, psa focuses on the second goal, of obtaining a visa. This can be achieved by applying to the USA embassy in Madrid, but the application requires an address in the USA. This address can be obtained by arranging for a hotel in Denver.\nThis example illustrates the form of “partial” planning adopted by the KGP model (where non-executable sub-goals as well as actions may be part of plans) and shows how the combination of transition PI with SI and AE allows the psa agent to deal with partial information, to generate conditional plans and plans with several “layers”, as follows:\n1. psa is initially equipped with the top-level goals to get a ticket to Denver and to obtain a visa (through an earlier application of GI)\n2. by PI for the first goal, psa adds a “partial” plan to its F , of buying a ticket online subject to sub-goals that there is an internet connection available and that online tickets can be bought to Denver; these sub-goals are sensing goals\n3. by SI, sensing actions are added to F to evaluate the sensing sub-goals in the environment\n4. these sensing actions are executed by AE (and KB0 is modified accordingly)\n5. depending on the sensed values of the sensing sub-goals the buying action may or may not be executed by AE; let us assume in the remainder of the example that this action is executed\n6. SR is applied to eliminate all actions (since they have already been executed), subgoals and top-level goal of getting a ticket to Denver (since they have been achieved)\n7. by PI for the remaining top-level goal of obtaining a visa, psa adds a plan to fill in an application form (action) and acquiring a residence address in Denver (sub-goal)\n8. the action cannot be executed, as psa knows that the businessman is not resident in the USA; further PI introduces a plan for the sub-goal of booking a hotel (action) for the subgoal of acquiring a residence address in Denver\n9. AE executes the booking action\n10. AE executes the action of applying for a visa\n11. SR eliminates all actions (since they have already been executed), sub-goal and toplevel goal of getting a visa (since they have been achieved)."

      "text" : "Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) (Jaffar & Maher, 1994) extends logic programming with constraint predicates which are not processed as ordinary logic programming predicates, defined by rules, but are checked for satisfiability and simplified by means of a built-in, “black-box” constraint solver. These predicates are typically used to constrain the values that variables in the conclusion of a rule can take (together with unification which is also treated via an equality constraint predicate). In the KGP model, constraints are used to determine the value of time variables, in goals and actions, under a suitable temporal constraint theory.\nThe CLP framework is defined over a structure < consisting of a domain D(<) and a set of constraint predicates which includes equality, together with an assignment of relations on D(<) for each such constraint predicate. In CLP, constraints are built as first-order formulae in the usual way from primitive constraints of the form c(t1, . . . , tn) where c is a constraint predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms constructed over the domain, D(<), of values. Then the rules of a constraint logic program, P , take the same form as rules in conventional logic programming given by\nH ← L1, . . . , Ln with H an (ordinary) atom, L1, . . . , Ln literals, and n ≥ 0. Literals can be positive, namely ordinary atoms, or negative, namely of the form notB, where B is an ordinary atom, or constraint atoms over <. The negation symbol not indicates negation as failure (first introduced by Clark, 1978). All variables in H and Li are implicitly universally quantified, with scope the entire rule. H is called the head (or the conclusion) and L1, . . . , Ln is called the body (or the conditions) of a rule of the form above. If n = 0, the rule is called a fact.\nA valuation, ϑ, of a set of variables is a mapping from these variables to the domain D(<) and the natural extension which maps terms to D(<). A valuation ϑ, on the set of all variables appearing in a set of constraints C, is called an <-solution of C iff Cϑ, obtained by applying ϑ to C, is satisfied, i.e. Cϑ evaluates to true under the given interpretation of the\nconstraint predicates and terms. This is denoted by ϑ |=< C. A set C is called <-solvable or <-satisfiable, denoted by |=< C, iff it has at least one <-solution, i.e. ϑ |=< C for some valuation ϑ.\nOne way to give the meaning of a constraint logic program P is to consider the grounding of the program over its Herbrand base and all possible valuations, over D(<), of its constraint variables. In each such rule, if the ground constraints C in the body are evaluated to true then the rule is kept with the constraints C dropped, otherwise the whole rule is dropped. Let ground(P ) be the resulting ground program. The meaning of P is then given by the meaning |=LP of ground(P ), for which there are many different possible choices (Kakas, Kowalski, & Toni, 1998). The resulting overall semantics for the constraint logic program P will be referred to as |=LP (<). More precisely, given a constraint logic program P and a conjunction N ∧ C (where N is a conjunction of non-constraint literals and C is a conjunction of constraint atoms), in the remainder of the paper we will write\nP |=LP (<) N ∧ C to denote that there exists a ground substitution ϑ over the variables of N ∧ C such that:\n• ϑ |=< C • ground(P ) |=LP Nϑ."

These are predicates not occurring in the head of any clause of P (without loss of generality, see (Kakas et al., 1998)). Atoms whose predicate is abducible are referred to as abducible atoms or simply as abducibles.\n• I is a set of integrity constraints, that is, a set of sentences in the language of P . All the integrity constraints in the KGP model have the implicative form\nL1, . . . , Ln ⇒ A1 ∨ . . . ∨Am (n ≥ 0,m > 0) where Li are literals (as in the case of rules) 2, Aj are atoms (possibly the special atom false). The disjunction A1∨ . . .∨Am is referred to as the head of the constraint and the conjunction L1, . . . , Ln is referred to as the body. All variables in an integrity constraint are implicitly universally quantified from the outside, except for variables occurring only in the head, which are implicitly existentially quantified with scope the head itself.\n2. If n = 0, then L1, . . . , Ln represents the special atom true.\nGiven an abductive logic program with constraints 〈<, P, A, I〉 and a formula (query) Q, which is an (implicitly existentially quantified) conjunction of literals in the language of P , the purpose of abduction is to find a (possibly minimal) set of (ground) abducible atoms Γ which, together with P , “entails” (an appropriate ground instantiation of) Q, with respect to some notion of “entailment” that the language of P is equipped with, and such that the extension of P by Γ “satisfies” I (see (Kakas et al., 1998) for possible notions of integrity constraint “satisfaction”). Here, the notion of “entailment” is the combined semantics |=LP (<), as discussed in Section 3.1.\nFormally, given a query Q, a set ∆ of (possibly non-ground) abducible atoms, and a set C of (possibly non-ground) constraints, the pair (∆, C) is an abductive answer (with constraints) for Q, with respect to an abductive logic program with constraints 〈<, P, A, I〉, iff for all groundings σ for the variables in Q,∆, C such that σ |=< C, it holds that\n(i) P ∪∆σ |=LP (<) Qσ, and (ii) P∪∆σ |=LP (<) I, i.e. for each B ⇒ H ∈ I, if P∪∆σ |=LP (<) B then P∪∆σ |=LP (<) H.\nHere, ∆σ plays the role of Γ in the earlier informal description of abductive answer. Note also that, by (ii), integrity constraints are not classical implications.\nNote also that, when representing knowledge as an abductive logic program, one needs to decide what should go into the logic program, what in the integrity constraints and what in the abducibles. Intuitively, integrity constraints are “normative” in that they need to be enforced, by making sure that their head holds whenever their body does (by condition (ii) above), whereas logic programming rules enable, with the help of abducibles, the derivation of given goals (by condition (i) above). Finally, abducibles are chosen amongst the literals that cannot be derived by means of logic programming rules. In this paper, we will represent reactive constraints (that are condition-action rules forcing the reactive behaviour of agents) as integrity constraints, thus to some extent addressing this knowledge representation challenge posed by abductive logic programming by imposing a sort of “structure” on the abductive logic programs we use.\nThe notion of abductive answer can be extended to take into account an initial set of (possibly non-ground) abducible atoms ∆0 and an initial set of (possibly non-ground) constraint atoms C0. In this extension, an abductive answer for Q, with respect to\n(〈<, P,A, I〉, ∆0, C0)\nis a pair (∆, C) such that\n(i) ∆ ∩∆0 = {} (ii) C ∩ C0 = {}, and (iii) (∆ ∪ ∆0, C ∪ C0) is an abductive answer for Q with respect to 〈<, P,A, I〉 (in the\nearlier sense).\nIt is worth noticing that an abductive answer (∆, C) for the query true with respect to\n(〈<, P,A, I〉, ∆0, C0)\nshould be read as the fact that the abducibles in ∆0 ∪ ∆, along with the constraints in C0 ∪ C, guarantee the overall consistency with respect to the integrity constraints given in I. This will be used for the specification of some capabilities of KGP agents.\nIn the remainder of the paper, for simplicity, we will omit < from abductive logic programs, which will be written simply as triples 〈P, A, I〉. In addition, all abductive logic programs that will present in KGP are variants of a core event calculus (Kowalski & Sergot, 1986), that we will define in Section 5.1.1."

We assume that incompatibility is symmetric and always includes that r Â s is incompatible with s Â r for any two rule names r, s. We refer to the set of all incompatibility rules as I.\nAny concrete LPP framework is equipped with a notion of entailment, which we denote by |=pr, that is defined on top of the underlying logic programming with constraints semantics |=LP (<). This is defined differently by different approaches to LPP but they all share the following pattern. Given a logic program with priorities T = 〈P,H, A, I〉 and a conjunction α of ground (non-auxiliary) atoms, T |=pr α iff\n(i) there exists a subset P ′ of the basic part P such that P ′ ∪A |=LP (<) α, and\n(ii) P ′ is “preferred” wrt H∪A over any other subset P ′′ of P that derives (under |=LP (<)) a conclusion that is incompatible, wrt I, with α.\nEach framework has its own way of specifying what is meant for one sub-theory P ′ to be “preferred” over another sub-theory P ′′. For example, in existing literature (Kakas et al., 1994; Prakken & Sartor, 1996; Kowalski & Toni, 1996; Kakas & Moraitis, 2003), |=pr is defined via argumentation. This is also the approach that we adopt, relying on the notion of an admissible argument as a sub-theory that is (i) consistent (does not have incompatible conclusions) and (ii) whose rules do not have lower priority, with respect to the high-level part H of our theory, than those of any other sub-theory that has incompatible conclusions with it. The precise definition of how sets of rules are to be compared again is a matter of choice in each specific framework of LPP.\nGiven such a concrete definition of admissible sub-theories, the preference entailment, T |=prα, is then given by:\n(i) there exists a (maximal) admissible sub-theory T ′ of T such that T ′ |=LP (<) α, and\n(ii) for any α that is incompatible with α there does not exist an admissible sub-theory T ′′ of T such that T ′′ |=LP (<) α.\nWhen only the first condition of the above is satisfied we say that the theory T credulously prefers or possibly prefers α. When both conditions are satisfied we say that the theory sceptically prefers α."

Note that it is important to distinguish between mental and sensing fluents as they are treated differently by the control of the agent: mental fluents need to be planned for, whereas sensing fluents can only be observed. This will be clarified later in the paper.\nWe also assume that the set of action operators is partitioned into three disjoint sets:\n• physical action operators, representing actions that the agent performs in order to achieve some specific effect, which typically causes some changes in the environment;\n• communication action operators, representing actions which involve communications with other agents;\n• sensing action operators, representing actions that the agent performs to establish whether some fluent (either a sensing fluent or an expected effect of some action) holds in the environment, or whether some agent has performed some action.\nFor example, sense(connection on, τ) is an action literal representing the act of sensing whether or not a network connection is on at time τ , do(clear table, τ) is an action literal representing the physical action of removing every item on a given table, and tell(c1, c2, request(r1), d, τ) is an action literal representing a communication action which expresses that agent c1 is requesting from agent c2 the resource r1 within a dialogue with identifier d, at time τ3.\nEach fluent and action operator has an associated arity: we assume that this arity is greater than or equal to 1, in that one argument (the last one, by convention) is always the time point at which a given fluent holds or a given action takes place. This time point may be a time variable or a time constant. Given a fluent f of arity n > 0, we refer to f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x) and ¬f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x), where each si is a constant and x is a time variable or a time constant as (timed) fluent literals 4. Given a fluent literal `, we denote by `\n3. The role of the dialogue identifier will become clearer in Section 10. Intuitively, this is used to “link” communication actions occurring within the same dialogue. 4. Note that ¬ represents classical negation. Negation as failure occurs in the model only within the knowledge bases of agents, supporting the reasoning capabilities and the cycle theory. All other negations in the state are to be understood as classical negations.\nits complement, namely ¬f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x) if ` is f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x), and f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x) if ` is ¬f(s1, . . . , sn−1, x). Examples of fluent literals are have resource(pen, τ), representing that a certain resource pen should be obtained at some time τ , as well as (the ground) ¬on(box, table, 10), representing that at time 10 (a certain) box should not be on (a certain) table.\nNote that we assume that fluent literals are ground except for the time parameter. This will allow us to keep the notation simpler and to highlight the crucial role played by the time parameter. Given this simplification, we will often denote timed fluent literals simply by `[x].\nGiven an action operator a of arity n > 0, we refer to a(s1, . . . , sn−1, x), where each si is a constant and x is a time variable or time constant, as a (timed) action literal. Similarly to the case of fluent literals, for simplicity, we will assume that timed action literals are ground except possibly for the time. Hence, we will often denote timed action literals by a[x].\nWe will adopt a special syntax for sensing actions, that will always have the form (x is either a time variable or a time constant):\n• sense(f, x), where f is a fluent, or • sense(c : a, x), where c is the name of an agent and a is an action operator.\nIn the first case, the sensing action allows the agent to inspect the external environment in order to check whether or not the fluent f holds at the time x of sensing. In the second case, the sensing action allows the agent to determine whether, at time x, another agent c has performed some action a.\nWe will now define formally the concept of state 〈KB0,F , C, Σ〉 of an agent."

For example, in the San Vincenzo scenario, p2 may be “transfer to airport needs to be arranged”, r1 may be a taxi, and c2 a taxi company, needed for transportation to some train station, and finally r2 may be a train ticket.\nNote that the time variable τ in non-executable goals `[τ ] and actions a[τ ] in (any tree in) F is to be understood as a variable that is existentially quantified within the whole state of the agent. Whenever a goal or action is introduced within a state, its time variable is to be understood as a distinguished, fresh variable, also serving as its identifier.\nAs indicated in Section 2, roots of trees are referred to as top-level goals, executable goals are often called simply actions, non-executable goals may be top-level goals or subgoals. For example, in Figure 2, the node with identifier τ1 is a top-level goal, the nodes with identifiers τ2, τ3 are sub-goals and the node with identifier τ4 is an action.\nNotation 4.1 Given a forest F and a tree T ∈ F :\n• for any node n of T , parent(n, T ), children(n, T ), ancestors(n, T ), siblings(n, T ), descendents(n, T ), will indicate the parent of node n in T , the children of n in T , etc. and leaf(n, T ) will have value true if n is a leaf in T , false otherwise.\n• for any node n of F , parent(n,F), children(n,F), ancestors(n,F), siblings(n,F), descendents(n,F), leaf(n,F) will indicate the parent(n, T ) for the tree T in F where n occurs, etc. (T is unique, due to the uniqueness of the time variable identifying nodes).\n• nodes(T ) will represent the set of nodes in T , and nodes(F) will represent the set nodes(F) = ⋃T ∈F nodes(T ).\nAgain, as indicated in Section 2, each top-level goal in each tree in F will be either reactive or non-reactive. We will see, in Section 7, that reactive top-level goals are introduced into the state by the RE transition whereas non-reactive top-level goals are introduced by the GI transition. For example, F of agent c1 may consist of the tree in Figure 2, with root a non-reactive goal, as well as a tree with root the reactive goal (action)\ntell(c1, c2, accept request(r3), d′, τ5). This action may be the reply (planned by agent c1) to some request for resource r3 by agent c2 (for example, in the San Vincenzo scenario, r3 may be a meeting requested by some colleague).\nNotation 4.2 Given a forest F • Rootsr(F) (resp.

Temporal constraints refer to time constants as well as to time variables associated with goals (currently or previously) in the state.\nFor example, given a forest with the tree in Figure 2, C may contain τ1 > 10, τ1 ≤ 20, indicating that the top-level goal (of fixing problem p2) needs to be achieved within the time interval (10, 20], τ2 < τ1, τ3 < τ1, indicating that resources r1 and r2 need to be acquired before the top-level goal can be deemed to be achieved, and τ4 < τ2, indicating that the agent needs to ask agent c2 first. Note that we do not need to impose that τ2 and τ3 are executed in some order, namely C may contain neither τ2 < τ3, nor τ3 < τ2.\n4.4 Agents’ Dynamic Knowledge Base: KB0\nKB0 is a set of logic programming facts in the state of an agent, recording the actions which have been executed (by the agent or by others) and their time of execution, as well as the properties (i.e. fluents and their negation) which have been observed and the time of the observation. Formally, these facts are of the following forms:\n• executed(a, t) where a[t] is a ground action literal, meaning that action a has been executed by the agent at time t.\n• observed(`, t) where `[t] is a ground fluent literal, meaning that ` has been observed to hold at time t.\n• observed(c, a[t′], t) where c is an agent’s name, different from the name of the agent whose state we are defining, t and t′ are time constants, and a[t′] is a (ground) action literal. This means that the given agent has observed at time t that agent c has executed the action a at time t′ 5.\n5. We will see that, by construction, it will always be the case that t′ ≤ t. Note that the time of executed actions, t′, and the time of their observation, t, will typically be different in any concrete implementation of the KGP model, as they depend, for example, on the time of execution of transitions within the operational trace of an agent.\nNote that all facts in KB0 are variable-free, as no time variables occur in them. Facts of the first kind record actions that have been executed by the agent itself. Facts of the second kind record observations made by the agent in the environment, excluding actions executed by other agents, which are represented instead as facts of the third kind.\nFor example, if the action labelled by τ4 in Figure 2 is executed (by the AE transition) at time 7 then executed(tell(c1, c2, request(r1), d), 7) will be added to KB0. Moreover, if, at time 9, c1 observes (e.g. by transition POI) that it has resource r2, then the observation observed(have resource(r2), 9) will be added to KB0. Finally, KB0 may contain\nobserved(c2, tell(c2, c1, request(r3), d′, 1), 6)\nto represent that agent c1 has become aware, at time 6, that agent c2 has requested, at the earlier time 1, resource r3 from c1."

For example, if the action labelled by τ4 in Figure 2 is executed at time 7, then τ4 = 7 will be added to Σ.\nThe use of Σ allows one to record the instantiation of time variables while at the same time keeping different goals with the same fluent distinguished. Clearly, for each time variable τ there exists at most one equality τ = t in Σ.\nNotation 4.3 Given a time variable τ , we denote by Σ(τ) the time constant t, if any, such that τ = t ∈ Σ.\nIt is worth pointing out that the valuation of any temporal constraint c ∈ C will always take the equalities in Σ into account. Namely, any ground valuation for the temporal variables in c must agree with Σ on the temporal variables assigned to them in Σ. For example, given Σ = {τ = 3} and C = {τ1 > τ}, then τ1 = 10 is a suitable valuation, whereas τ1 = 1 is not."

      "text" : "In a nutshell, the EC allows one to write meta-logic programs which “talk” about objectlevel concepts of fluents, events (that we interpret as action operators) 7, and time points. The main meta-predicates of the formalism are:\n• holds at(F, T ) - a fluent F holds at a time T ; • clipped(T1, F, T2) - a fluent F is clipped (from holding to not holding) between times\nT1 and T2;\n• declipped(T1, F, T2) - a fluent F is declipped (from not holding to holding) between times T1 and T2;\n• initially(F ) - a fluent F holds at the initial time, say time 0; • happens(O, T ) - an operation O happens at a time T ; • initiates(O, T, F ) - a fluent F starts to hold after an operation O at time T ;\n6. A more sophisticated, abductive logic programming version of |=TR and KBTR is given by Bracciali and Kakas (2004). 7. In this section we use the original event calculus terminology of events instead of operators, as in the rest of the paper.\n• terminates(O, T, F ) - a fluent F ceases to hold after an operation O at time T .\nRoughly speaking, the last two predicates represent the cause-effects links between operations and fluents in the modelled world. We will also use a meta-predicate\n• precondition(O,F ) - the fluent F is one of the preconditions for the executability of the operation O.\nFluent literals in an agent’s state are mapped onto the EC as follows. The EC-like representation of a fluent literal f [τ ] (resp. ¬f [τ ]) in an agent’s state is the atom holds at(f, τ) (resp. holds at(¬f, τ)). Moreover, when arguments other than the time variable need to be considered, the EC representation of a fluent literal f(x1, . . . , xn, τ) (resp. ¬f(x1, . . . , xn, τ)) is holds at(f(x1, . . . , xn), τ) (resp. holds at(¬f(x1, . . . , xn), τ). 8\nSimilarly, action literals in the state of an agent can be represented in the EC in a straightforward way. Given an action literal a[τ ] its EC representation is happens(a, τ). When arguments other than time are considered, as e.g. in a(x1, . . . , xn, τ), the EC representation is given by happens(a(x1, . . . xn), τ).\nIn the remainder of the paper, with an abuse of terminology, we will sometimes refer to f(x1, . . . , xn) and ¬f(x1, . . . , xn) interchangeably as fluent literals or fluents (although strictly speaking they are fluent literals), and to a(x1, . . . xn) interchangeably as action literals or action operators (although strictly speaking they are action literals).\nThe EC allows one to represent a wide variety of phenomena, including operations with indirect effects, non-deterministic operations, and concurrent operations (Shanahan, 1997).\nThe core EC we use in this paper consists of two parts: domain-independent rules and domain-dependent rules. The basic domain-independent rules, directly borrowed from the original EC, are:\nholds at(F, T2) ← happens(O, T1), initiates(O, T1, F ), T1 < T2, not clipped(T1, F, T2) holds at(¬F, T2) ← happens(O, T1), terminates(O, T1, F ), T1 < T2, not declipped(T1, F, T2) holds at(F, T ) ← initially(F ), 0 ≤ T, not clipped(0, F, T ) holds at(¬F, T ) ← initially(¬F ), 0 ≤ T, not declipped(0, F, T ) clipped(T1, F, T2) ← happens(O, T ), terminates(O, T, F ), T1 ≤ T < T2 declipped(T1, F, T2) ← happens(O, T ), initiates(O, T, F ), T1 ≤ T < T2\nThe domain-dependent rules define initiates, terminates, and initially, e.g. in the case of setting 2.6.1 in Section 2.6 we may have\ninitiates(tell(C, svs, inform(Q, I), D), T, have info(svs,Q, I)) ← holds at(trustworthy(C), T )\ninitially(¬have info(svs, arrival(tr01), I) 8. Note that we write holds at(¬f(x1, . . . , xn), τ) instead of not holds at(f(x1, . . . , xn), τ), as done e.g. by\nShanahan, 1997, because we want to reason at the object-level about properties being true or false in the environment. We use not within the meta-level axioms of the event calculus (see below) to implement persistence.\ninitially(trustworthy(co))\nNamely, an action by agent C of providing information I concerning a query Q to the agent svs (the “San Vincenzo station” agent) initiates the agent svs having the information about Q, provided that C is trustworthy. Moreover, initially agent co (the “Central Office” agent) is trustworthy, and agent svs has no information about the arrival time of tr01. The conditions for the rule defining initiates can be seen as preconditions for the effects of the operator tell to take place. Preconditions for the executability of operators are specified by means of a set of rules (facts) defining the predicate precondition, e.g.\nprecondition(tell(svs, C, inform(Q, I), D), have info(svs, Q, I))\nnamely the precondition for agent svs to inform any agent C of I about Q is that svs indeed has information I about Q.\nNotice that the presence in the language of fluents and their negation, e.g. f and ¬f , poses the problem of “inconsistencies”, i.e. it may be the case that both holds at(f, t) and holds at(¬f, t) can be derived from the above axioms and a set of events (i.e. a given set of happens atoms). However, it can easily be shown that this is never the case, provided that the domain-dependent part does not contain two conflicting statements of the form initially(f) and initially(¬f) since inconsistencies cannot be caused except at the initial time point (see e.g. Miller & Shanahan, 2002, p. 459).\nIn the remainder of the paper we will assume that the domain-dependent part is always consistent for our agents.\nTo allow agents to draw conclusions from the contents of KB0, which represents the “narrative” part of the agent’s knowledge, we add to the domain-independent rules the following bridge rules:\nholds at(F, T2) ← observed(F, T1), T1 ≤ T2, not clipped(T1, F, T2) holds at(¬F, T2) ← observed(¬F, T1), T1 ≤ T2, not declipped(T1, F, T2) happens(O, T ) ← executed(O, T ) happens(O, T ) ← observed( , O[T ], )\nNotice that these bridge rules make explicit the translation from the state representation to the EC representation of fluents and actions we have mentioned earlier on in this section. Note also that we assume that a fluent holds from the time it is observed to hold. This choice is dictated by the rationale that observations can only be considered and reasoned upon from the moment the agent makes them. On the other hand, actions by other agents have effect from the time they have been executed 9.\nHaving introduced the ability to reason with narratives of events and observations, we need to face the problem of “inconsistency” due to conflicting observations, e.g. an agent may observe that both a fluent and its negation hold at the same time. As we have done\n9. If the time of the action is unknown at observation time, then the last rule above may be replaced by happens(O, T ) ← observed( , O[ ], T ) namely the value of a fluent is changed according to observations from the moment the observations\nare made.\nabove for the set of initially atoms, we will assume that the external world is consistent too, i.e. it can never happen that both observed(f, t) and observed(¬f, t) belong to KB0, for any fluent f and time point t.\nHowever, we still need to cope with the frame consistency problem, which arises, e.g. given observations observed(f, t) and observed(¬f, t′), with t 6= t′. This issue is analogous to the case when two different events happen at the same time point and they initiate and terminate the same fluent. In the original EC suitable axioms for the predicates clipped and declipped are added, as given above, to avoid both a fluent and its negation holding at the same time after the happening of two such events at the same time. We adopt here a similar solution to cope with observations, namely by adding the following two axioms to the domain-independent part:\nclipped(T1, F, T2) ← observed(¬F, T ), T1 ≤ T < T2 declipped(T1, F, T2) ← observed(F, T ), T1 ≤ T < T2\nThis solution may be naive in some circumstances and more sophisticated solutions may be adopted, as e.g. the one proposed by Bracciali and Kakas (2004)."

Here, we propose a novel variant, somewhat inspired by the E-language (Kakas & Miller, 1997), to allow situated agents to generate partial plans in a dynamic environment.\nWe will refer to KBplan = 〈Pplan, Aplan, Iplan〉 as the abductive logic program where: 10. Here and in the remainder of the paper sets are seen as conjunctions, where appropriate.\n• Aplan = {assume holds, assume happens}, namely we consider two abducible predicates, corresponding to assuming that a fluent holds or that an action occurs, respectively, at a certain time point;\n• Pplan is obtained by adding to the core EC axioms and the “narrative” given by KB0 the following rules happens(O, T ) ← assume happens(O, T ) holds at(F, T ) ← assume holds(F, T )\n• Iplan contains the following set of integrity constraints holds at(F, T ), holds at(¬F, T ) ⇒ false assume happens(O, T ), precondition(O, P ) ⇒ holds at(P, T ) assume happens(O, T ), not executed(O, T ), time now(T ′) ⇒ T > T ′\nThese integrity constraints in Iplan prevent the generation of (partial) plans which are unfeasible. The first integrity constraint makes sure that no plan is generated which entails that a fluent and its negation hold at the same time. The second integrity constraint makes sure that, if a plan requires an action to occur at a certain time point, the further goal of enforcing the preconditions of that action to hold at that time point is taken into account in the same plan. This means that, if those preconditions are not already known to hold, the plan will need to accommodate actions to guarantee that they will hold at the time of execution of the action. Finally, the last integrity constraint forces all assumed unexecuted actions in a plan to be executable in the future, where the predicate time now( ) is meant to return the current time.\nIt is worth recalling that, in concrete situations, Pplan and Iplan will also contain domaindependent rules and constraints. Domain-dependent rules may be needed not only to define initiates, terminates, initially and precondition, but they may also contain additional rules/integrity constraints expressing ramifications, e.g.\nholds at(f, T ) ⇒ holds at(f1, T ) ∨ . . . ∨ holds at(fn, T ) for some specific fluents in the domain. Moreover, integrity constraints may represent specific properties of actions and fluents in the domain. As an example, a domain-dependent constraint could express that two actions of some type cannot be executed at the same time, e.g.\nholds at(tell(c,X, accept request(R), D), T ), holds at(tell(c,X, refuse request(R), D), T ) ⇒ false Intuitively, constructing a (partial) plan for a goal (that is a given leaf node in the current forest) amounts to identifying actions and further sub-goals allowing to achieve the goal, while assuming that all other nodes in the forest, both executable and non-executable, are feasible. Concretely, the abductive logic program KBplan supports partial planning as follows. Whenever a plan for a given goal requires the agent to execute an action, a[τ ] say, the corresponding atom assume happens(a, τ) is assumed, which amounts to intending to execute the action (at some concrete time instantiating τ). On the other hand, if a plan for a given goal requires to plan for a sub-goal, `[τ ] say, the corresponding atom assume holds(`, τ) may be assumed, which amounts to setting the requirement that further planning will be needed for the sub-goal itself. Notice that if only total plans are taken into account, no atoms of the form assume holds( , ) will ever be generated.\nFormally, let KBnowplan be KBplan ∪ {time now(now)}, where now is a time constant (intuitively, the time when the planning capability is invoked). Then, the planning capability |=nowplan is specified as follows 11.\nLet S = 〈KB0,F , C, Σ〉 be a state, and G = `[τ ] be a mental goal labeling a leaf node in a tree T of F . Let also\nCA = {assume happens(a, τ ′) | a[τ ′] ∈ nodes(F)}, CG = {assume holds(`′, τ ′) | `′[τ ′] ∈ nodes(F) \\ {`[τ ]}}\nand\n• ∆0 = CA ∪ CG • C0 = C ∪ Σ.\nThen, S, G |=nowplan (Xs, TC)\niff\nXs = {a[τ ′] | assume happens(a, τ ′) ∈ ∆} ∪ {`′[τ ′] | assume holds(`′, τ ′) ∈ ∆}\nfor some (∆, TC) which is an abductive answer for holds at(`, τ), wrt (KBnowplan, ∆0, C0). If no such abductive answer exists, then S, G |=nowplan ⊥, where ⊥ is used here to indicate failure (i.e. that no such abductive answer exists).\nAs an example, consider setting 2.6.2 in Section 2.6. The domain-dependent part of KBplan for agent psa (looking after the businessman in our scenario) contains\ninitiates(buy ticket online(From, To), T, have ticket(From, To)) precondition(buy ticket online(From, To), available connection) precondition(buy ticket online(From, To), available destination(To))\nThe goal G is have ticket(madrid, denver, τ). Assume F only consists of a single tree consisting solely of the root G, thus CA = CG = {}. Then, S, G |=nowplan (Xs, TC) where\nXs = {buy ticket online(madrid, denver, τ ′), available connection(τ ′′), available destination(denver, τ ′′′)}\nand TC = {τ ′ < τ, τ ′ = τ ′′ = τ ′′′, τ ′ > now}."

Here and below, with an abuse of notation, we use the notions of timed fluent and action literals liberally and allow them to be non-ground, even though we have defined timed fluent and action literals as ground except possibly for the time parameter. 13.

However, any reactive constraint Body ⇒ Reaction, TC can be transformed into an integrity constraint Body ⇒ New with a new clause New ← Reaction, TC in Preact. Thus, with an abuse of notation, we treat reactive constraints as integrity constraints.\ntemporal constraints TC, should be added to F and C, respectively.

      "text" : "The Goal Decision reasoning capability allows the agent to decide, at a given time point, the (non-reactive) top-level goals to be pursued, for which it will then go on to generate plans aiming at achieving them. The generated goals are the goals of current preferred interest but this interest may change over time. 14. We assume that ∧{} = true.\nThe Goal Decision capability operates according to a theory, KBGD, in which the agent represents its goal preference policy. KBGD includes KBTR and thus the dynamic, observed knowledge, KB0, in the current state of the agent. KBGD is expressed in a variant of LPP described in Section 3.3, whereby the rules in the lower or basic part P of the LPP theory T have the form (T being a possibly empty sequence of variables): n(τ, T ) : G[τ, T ] ← B[T ], C[T ] where\n• τ is a time variable, existentially quantified with scope the head of the rule and not a member of T ;\n• all variables except for τ are universally quantified with scope the rule; • the head G[τ, T ] of the rule consists of a fluent literal conjoined with a (possibly\nempty) set of temporal constraints, represented as 〈`[τ ], TC[τ, T ]〉; • B(T ) is a non-empty conjunction of literals on a set of auxiliary predicates that can\ninclude atoms of the form holds at(`, T ′), where `[T ′] is a timed fluent literal, and the atom time now(T ′′) for some variables T ′, T ′′;\n• the conditions of the rule are constrained by the (possibly empty) temporal constraints C[T ].\nAny such rule again represents all of its ground instances under any total valuation of the variables in T that satisfies the constraints C[T ]. Each ground instance is named by the corresponding ground instance of n(τ, T ). Intuitively, when the conditions of one such rule are satisfied at a time now that grounds the variable T ′′ with the current time at which the capability is applied, then the goal in the head of the rule is sanctioned as one of the goals that the agent would possibly prefer to achieve at this time. The decision whether such a goal is indeed preferred would then depend on the high-level or strategy part H of KBGD, containing priority rules, as described in Section 3.3, between the rules in the lower-part or between other rules in H. These priority rules can also include temporal atoms of the form holds at(`, T ′) and the atom time now(T ′′) in their conditions.\nTo accommodate this form of rules we only need to extend our notion of incompatibility I in T to be defined on conclusions 〈`(τ), TC[τ, T ]〉. To simplify the notation, in the remainder we often write 〈`(τ), TC〉 instead of 〈`(τ), TC[τ, T ]〉.\nThe incompatibility I can be defined in different ways. For example, a (relatively) weak notion of incompatibility is given as follows. Two pairs 〈`1(τ1), TC1〉 and 〈`2(τ2), TC2〉 are incompatible iff for every valuation σ such that TC1 and TC2 are both satisfied, the ground instances of `1(τ1)σ and `2(τ2)σ are incompatible. A stronger notion would require that it is sufficient for only one such valuation σ to exist that makes the corresponding ground literals incompatible.\nLet us denote by KBnowGD the theory KBGD ∪ {time now(now)}, where now is a time constant. Then, the goal decision capability, |=nowGD , is defined directly in terms of the preference entailment, |=pr, of LPP (see Section 3.3), as follows.\nGiven a state S = 〈KB0,F , C,Σ〉, S |=nowGD Gs\nwhere\nGs = {G1, G2, . . . , Gn}, n ≥ 0, Gi = 〈`i(τi), TCi〉 for all i = 1, . . . , n iff Gs is a maximal set such that\nKBnowGD |=pr 〈`1(τ1), TC1〉 ∧ . . . ∧ 〈`n(τn), TCn〉. This means that a new set of goals Gs is generated that is currently (sceptically) preferred under the goal preference policy represented in KBGD and the current information in KB0. Note that any two goals in Gs are necessarily compatible with each other. There are two special cases where there are no sceptically preferred goals at the time now. The first one concerns the case where there are no goals that are currently sanctioned by the (lower-part) of KBGD. When this is so |=nowGD returns an empty set of goals (n = 0). The second special case occurs when there are at least two goals which are each separately credulously preferred but these goals are incompatible which each other. Then S |=nowGD ⊥, where ⊥ is used to indicate failure in identifying new goals to be pursued.\nAs an example, consider the San Vincenzo scenario where the psa agent needs to decide whether to return home or to recharge its battery. The agent’s goals are categorised and assigned priority according to their category and possibly other factors. The KBGD expressing this is given as follows:\n• The low-level part contains the rules:\nn(rh, τ1) : 〈return home(τ1), {τ1 < T ′}〉 ← holds at(finished work, T ), holds at(¬at home, T ), time now(T ), T ′ = T + 6 n(rb, τ2) : 〈recharge battery(τ2), {τ2 < T ′}〉 ← holds at(low battery, T ), time now(T ), T ′ = T + 2\n• The auxiliary part contains, in addition to KBTR and KB0, the following rules that specify the category of each goal and the relative urgency between these categories:\ntypeof(return home, required) typeof(recharge battery, operational) more urgent wrt type(operational, required)\n• The incompatibility part consists of\nincompatible(return home(T ), recharge battery(T ))\nNamely, the two goals are pairwise incompatible, i.e. the agent can only do one of these goals at a time.\n• The high-level part contains the following priority rule:\ngd pref(X, Y ) : n(X, ) ≺ n(Y, ) ← typeof(X,XT ), typeof(Y, Y T ), more urgent wrt type(XT, Y T ).\nThen, for now = 1 and current state S = 〈KB0,F , C, Σ〉 such that finished work and away from home both hold (by temporal reasoning) at time now, we have that\nS |=nowGD {〈return home(τ1), {τ1 < 7}〉}.\nSuppose instead that KB0 contains observed(low battery, 1). Then, using the weak notion of incompatibility, requiring that\nfor every σ such that σ |=cs {τ1 < 7, τ2 < 3} it holds that incompatible(return home(τ1)σ, recharge battery(τ2)σ)\nwe have:\nS |=nowGD {〈return home(τ1), {τ1 < 7}〉, 〈recharge battery(τ2), {τ2 < 3}〉}.\nIndeed, for σ = {τ1 = 3, τ2 = 2}, incompatible(return home(3), recharge battery(2)) does not hold. However, using the stronger notion of incompatibility, requiring that\nthere exists σ such that σ |=cs {τ1 < 7, τ2 < 3} it holds that incompatible(return home(τ1)σ, recharge battery(τ2)σ)\nwe have:\nS |=nowGD {〈recharge battery(τ2), {τ2 < 3}〉}.\nSuppose now that KBGD contains a second operational goal 〈replace part(τ3), {τ3 < 5}〉 that is also sanctioned by a rule in its lower part at time now = 1. Then under the stronger form of incompatibility the goal decision capability at now = 1 will return ⊥ as both these operational goals are credulously preferred but none of them is sceptically preferred."

      "heading" : "6. Physical Capabilities",
      "text" : "In addition to the reasoning capabilities we have defined so far, an agent is equipped with physical capabilities that allow it to experience the world in which it is situated; this world consists of other agents and/or objects that provide an environment for the agents in which to interact and communicate.\nWe identify two types of physical capabilities: sensing and actuating. In representing these capabilities we abstract away from the sensors and the actuators that an agent would typically rely upon to access and affect the environment. We will also assume that these sensors and actuators are part of the agent’s body, which we classify as an implementation issue (Stathis et al., 2004).\nThe physical sensing capability models the way an agent interacts with its external environment in order to inspect it, e.g. to find out whether or not some fluent holds at a given time. On the other hand, the physical actuating capability models the way an agent interacts with its external environment in order to affect it, by physically executing its actions.\nWe represent the sensing physical capability of an agent as a function of the form:\nsensing(L, t) = L′\nwhere:\n• L is a (possibly empty) set of – fluent literals f ,\n– terms of the form c : a (meaning that agent c has performed action a),\nall to be sensed at a concrete time t, and\n• L′ is a (possibly empty) set of elements s′ such that – s′ is a term f : v, f being a fluent and v ∈ {true, false}, meaning that fluent f\nhas been observed to have value v (namely to be true or to be false) at time t, or – s′ is a term of the form c : a[t′], c being an agent name and a being an action, meaning that agent c has performed action a at time t′.\nNote that physical sensing requires the time-stamp t to specify the time at which it is applied within transitions. Note also that, given a non-empty set L, sensing(L, t) may be partial, e.g. for some fluent f ∈ L, it can be that neither f : true ∈ L′, nor f : false ∈ L′.\nSimilarly, we represent the physical actuating capability as a function\nactuating(As, t) = As′\nwhere:\n• As is a set of action literals {a1, · · · , an}, n > 0, that the agent instructs the body to actuate at time t;\n• As′ ⊆ As is the subset of actions that the body has actually managed to perform. The meaning of an action a belonging to As and not belonging to As′ is that the physical actuators of the agent’s body were not able to perform a in the current situation. It is worth pointing out that if an action a belongs to As′ it does not necessarily mean that the effects of a have successfully been reached. Indeed, some of the preconditions of the executed action (i) may have been wrongly believed by the agent to be true at execution time (as other agents may have interfered with them) or (ii) the agent may have been unaware of these preconditions. For example, after having confirmed availability, the agent may have booked a hotel by sending an e-mail, but (i) some other agent has booked the last available room in the meanwhile, or (ii) the agent did not provide a credit card number to secure the booking. In other words, the beliefs of the agent (as held in KB0) may be incorrect and/or incomplete.\nIn Section 7 and Section 8 below, we will see that AOI (Active Observation Introduction) can be used to check effects of actions (identified by the fES effect selection operator, in turn using the |=eff reasoning capability) after actions have been executed. Moreover, SI (Sensing Introduction) can be used to check preconditions of actions (identified by the fPS precondition selection operator, in turn using the |=pre reasoning capability) just before they are executed, to make sure that the actions are indeed executable. Overall, the following cases may occur:\n• an action belongs to As′ because it was executed and – its preconditions held at the time of execution and its effects hold in the envi-\nronment after execution;\n– its preconditions were wrongly believed to hold at the time of execution (because the agent has partial knowledge of the environment or its KBplan is incorrect) and as a consequence its effects do not hold after execution;\n– its preconditions were known not to hold at the time of execution (e.g. because the agent observed only after having planned that they did not hold, but had no time to -replan) and as a consequence its effects do not hold after execution;\n• an action belongs to As\\As′ because it was not executed (the body could not execute it).\nThe actuating physical capability does not check preconditions/effects: this is left to other capabilities called within transitions before and/or after the transition invoking actuating, as we will show below. As before, the way the body will carry out the actions is an implementation issue (Stathis et al., 2004)."

This effect though can be minimized by calling (in the cycle theory) the GI transition only at certain times, e.g. after the current goals have been achieved or timed-out. Alternatively, the earlier formalisation of the GI transition could be modified so that, in case (ii), for all goals in Gs that already occur (modulo their temporal variables and associated temporal constraints) as roots of (non-reactive) trees in F , these trees are kept in F ′. A simple way to characterise (some of) these goals is as follows.

For example, Gs may contain\nG = 〈have ticket(madrid, denver, τ2), {τ2 < 12}〉 with have ticket(madrid, denver, τ1) ∈ Rootsnr(F) and C = {τ1 < 12}.\nThen, G definitely belongs to Gs′.

Formally, a cycle theory Tcycle consists of the following parts. • An initial part Tinitial, that determines the possible transitions that the agent could\nperform when it starts to operate. Concretely, Tinitial consists of rules of the form ∗T (S0, X) ← C(S0, X) which we refer to via the name R0|T (S0, X). These rules sanction that, if conditions C hold in the initial state S0 then the initial transition could be T , applied to state S0 and input X. For example, the rule R0|GI(S0, {}) : ∗GI(S0, {}) ← empty forest(S0) sanctions that the initial transition should be GI, if the forest in the initial state S0 is empty.\nNote that C(S0, X) may be empty, and, if non-empty, C(S0, X) may refer to the current time via a condition time now(t). For example, the rule\nR0|PI(S0, G) : ∗PI(S0, G) ← Gs = fGS(S0, t), Gs 6= {}, G ∈ Gs, time now(t) sanctions that the initial transition should be PI, if the forest in the initial state S0 contains some goal that can be planned for at the current time (in that the goal selection operator picks that goal).\n• A basic part Tbasic that determines the possible transitions following given transitions, and consists of rules of the form\n∗T ′(S′, X ′) ← T (S, X, S′, t), EC(S′, X ′)\nwhich we refer to via the name RT |T ′(S′, X ′). These rules sanction that, after transition T has been executed, starting at time t in the state S and resulting in state S′, and the conditions EC evaluated in S′ are satisfied, then transition T ′ could be the next transition to be applied in S′, with input X ′.16 EC are enabling conditions as they determine when T ′ can be applied after T . They also determine input X ′ for T ′, via calls to selection operators. As for the initial part of Tcycle, EC may be empty and, if not, may refer to the current time. For example, the rule\nRAE|PI(S′, G) : ∗PI(S′, G) ← AE(S, As, S′, t), Gs = fGS(S′, t′), Gs 6= {}, G ∈ Gs, time now(t′)\nsanctions that PI should follow AE if at the current time there is some goal in the current state that is selected by the goal selection function.\n• A behaviour part Tbehaviour that contains rules describing dynamic priorities amongst rules in Tbasic and Tinitial. Rules in Tbehaviour are of the form\nRT |T ′(S,X ′) Â RT |T ′′(S, X ′′) ← BC(S, X ′, X ′′) with T ′ 6= T ′′, which we will refer to via the name PTT ′ÂT ′′ . Recall that RT |T ′(·) and RT |T ′′(·) are (names of) rules in Tbasic∪Tinitial. Note that, with an abuse of notation, T could be 0 in the case that one such rule is used to specify a priority over the first transition to take place, in other words, when the priority is over rules in Tinitial. These rules in Tbehaviour sanction that, after transition T , if the conditions BC hold, then we prefer the next transition to be T ′ over T ′′. The conditions BC are behaviour conditions as they give the behavioural profile of the agent. For example, the rule\nPTGIÂT ′ : RT |GI(S, {}) Â RT |T ′(S, X) ← empty forest(S) sanctions that GI should be preferred to any other transition after any transition that results into a state with an empty forest. As for the other components of Tcycle, the conditions BC may refer to the current time.\n• An auxiliary part including definitions for any predicates occurring in the enabling and behaviour conditions.\n• An incompatibility part, in effect expressing that only one (instance of a) transition can be chosen at any one time.\nHence, Tcycle is an LPP-theory where: (i) P = Tinitial ∪ Tbasic, and (ii) H = Tbehaviour."

      "text" : "The normal cycle theory is a concrete example of cycle theory, specifying a pattern of operation where the agent prefers to follow a sequence of transitions that allows it to achieve its goals in a way that matches an expected “normal” behaviour. Other examples of possible cycle theories can be found in the literature (Kakas, Mancarella, Sadri, Stathis, & Toni, 2005; Sadri & Toni, 2006).\nBasically, the “normal” agent first introduces goals (if it has none to start with) via GI, then reacts to them, via RE, and then repeats the process of planning for them, via PI, executing (part of) the chosen plans, via AE, revising its state, via SR, until all goals are dealt with (successfully or revised away). At this point the agent returns to introducing new goals via GI and repeating the above process. Whenever in this process the agent is interrupted via a passive observation, via POI, it chooses to introduce new goals via GI, to take into account any changes in the environment. Whenever it has actions which are “unreliable”, in the sense that their preconditions definitely need to be checked, the agent senses them (via SI) before executing the action. Whenever it has actions which are “unreliable”, in the sense that their effects definitely need to be checked, the agent actively introduces actions that aim at sensing these effects, via AOI, after having executed the original actions. If initially the agent is equipped with some goals, then it would plan for them straightaway by PI.\nThe full definition of the normal cycle theory is given in the appendix. This is used to provide the control in the examples of the next section. Here, note that, although the normal cycle theory is based on the classic observe-plan-act cycle of agent control, it generalises this in several ways giving more flexibility on the agent behaviour to adapt to a changing environment. For example, the goals of the agent need not be fixed but can be dynamically changed depending on newly acquired information. Let us illustrates this feature with a brief example here. Suppose that the current state of our agent contains the top-level nonreactive goal 〈return home(τ1), {τ1 < 7}〉 and that a POI occurs which adds an observation observed(low battery, 2) at time 2. A subsequent GI transition generated by the normal cycle theory introduces a new goal 〈recharge battery(τ2), {τ2 < 3}〉 which, depending on the details of KBGD, either replaces the previous goal or adds this as an additional goal. The normal cycle theory will next choose to do a PI transition for the new and more urgent goal of recharging its battery."

These are:\ng11 = available connection(τ11), g12 = available destination(denver, τ12), a13 = buy ticket online(madrid, denver, τ13).\nAlso, consequently, the set of temporal constraints is updated to:\nC = {τ1 < 15, τ2 < 15, τ11 = τ13, τ12 = τ13, τ13 < τ1, τ1 > 2}.\nThe action a13 is generated as an action that initiates goal g1. Moreover, every plan that is generated must satisfy the integrity constraints in KBplan. In particular, any precondition of actions in the tree that do not already hold must be generated as sub-goals in the tree. This is why g11 and g12 are generated in the tree as above.\nNow via the transition SI, the following sensing actions are added to T1 as siblings of action a13 18:\na14 = sense(available connection, τ14) a15 = sense(available destination(denver), τ15)\nand the constraints\nτ14 = τ15, τ14 < τ13\nare added to C. Then, via AE, these two sensing actions are executed (before the original action a1), and KB0 is updated with the result of the sensing as follows. Suppose these two actions are executed at time 5. Consider the first action that senses the fluent available connection. If this fluent is confirmed by the physical sensing capability, i.e. if available connection : true is in X such that\nsensing({available connection, available destination}, 5) = X, then observed(available connection, 5) is added to KB0. On the other hand, if\navailable connection : false\nis in X as above, then observed(¬available connection, 5) is added to KB0. In both cases τ14 = 5 is added to Σ.\nIf neither of these cases occurs, i.e. if the sensing capability cannot confirm either of available connection or ¬available connection, then no fact is added to KB0. Similarly for the other precondition, available destination. Let us assume that after this step of AE, KB0 becomes\nobserved(available connection, 5) observed(available destination(denver), 5)\nAE can then execute the original action a13. Note that the agent might decide to execute the action even if one or both preconditions are not known to be satisfied after the sensing. If g1 is achieved, SR will eliminate it and a13, a14, a15, g11, g12 from the state. In the resulting state, F = {T2}, and PI is called, say at time 6. This results in generating a partial plan for g2, and changing the state so that in T2 the root g2 has children\na21 = apply visa(usa, τ21) g22 = have address(usa, τ22)\nand τ21 < τ2, τ22 = τ21 are added to C.

      "text" : "Many proposals exist for models and architectures of individual agents based on computational logic foundations (see e.g. the survey by Fisher, Bordini, Hirsch, & Torroni, 2007). Some of these proposals are based on logic programming, for example IMPACT (Arisha, Ozcan, Ross, Subrahmanian, Eiter, & Kraus, 1999; Subrahmanian, Bonatti, Dix, Eiter, Kraus, Ozcan, & Ross, 2000), AAA (Balduccini & Gelfond, 2008; Baral & Gelfond, 2001), DALI (Costantini & Tocchio, 2004), MINERVA (Leite, Alferes, & Pereira, 2002), GOLOG (Levesque, Reiter, Lesperance, Lin, & Scherl, 1997), and IndiGolog (De Giacomo, Levesque, & Sardiña, 2001). Other proposals are based on modal logic or first-order logic approaches, for example the BDI model (Bratman et al., 1988; Rao & Georgeff, 1997) and its extensions to deal with normative reasoning (Broersen, Dastani, Hulstijn, Huang, & van der Torre, 2001), Agent0 (Shoham, 1993), AgentSpeak (Rao, 1996) and its variants, 3APL (Hindriks, de Boer, van der Hoek, & Meyer, 1999) and its variants (Dastani, Hobo, & Meyer, 2007).\nAt a high level of comparison there are similarities in the objectives of most existing computational logic models of agency and KGP, in that they all aim at specifying knowledgerich agents with certain desirable behaviours. There are also some similarities in the finer details of the KGP model and some of the above related work, as well as differences.\nA feature of the KGP which, to the best of our knowledge, is novel is the declarative and context-sensitive specification of an agent’s cycle. To avoid a static cycle of control (Rao & Georgeff, 1991; Rao, 1996), KGP relies upon a cycle theory which determines, at run time, given the circumstances and the individual profile of the agent, what the next step should be. The cycle theory is sensitive to both solicited and unsolicited information that the agent receives from its environment, and helps the agent to adapt its behaviour to the changes it experiences. The approach closest to our work is that of 3APL (Hindriks et al., 1999) as extended by Dastani, de Boer, Dignum, and Meyer (2003), which provides meta-programming constructs for specifying the cycle of an agent such as goal selection, plan expansion, execution, as well as if-then-else and while-loop statements. Unlike the imperative constructs of 3APL, KGP uses a set of selection operators that can be extended to model different behaviours and types of agents. A flexible ordering of transitions is then obtained using preference reasoning about which transitions can be applied at a specific point in time. These preferences may change according to external events or changes in the knowledge of the agent.\nAnother central distinguishing feature of the KGP model, in comparison with existing models, including those based on logic programming, is its modular integration within a single framework of abductive logic programming, temporal reasoning, constraint logic programming, and preference reasoning based on logic programming with priorities, in order to support a diverse collection of capabilities. Each one of these is specified declaratively and equipped with its own provably correct computational counterpart (see Bracciali,\nDemetriou, Endriss, Kakas, Lu, Mancarella, Sadri, Stathis, Terreni, & Toni, 2004, for a detailed discussion).\nCompared with existing logic programming approaches KGP has two main similarities with MINERVA (Leite et al., 2002), an architecture that exploits computational logic and gives both declarative and operational semantics to its agents. Unlike KGP, a MINERVA agent consists of several specialised, possibly concurrent, sub-agents performing various tasks, and relies upon MDLP (Multidimensional Dynamic Logic Programming) (Leite et al., 2002). MDLP is the basic knowledge representation mechanism of an agent in MINERVA, which is based on an extension of answer-set programming and explicit rules for updating the agent’s knowledge base. In KGP instead we integrate abductive logic programming and logic programming with priorities combined with temporal reasoning.\nClosely related to our work in KGP is the logic-based agent architecture for reasoning agents of Baral and Gelfond (2001). This architecture assumes that the state of an agent’s environment is described by a set of fluents that evolve over time in terms of transitions labelled by actions. An agent is also assumed to be capable of correctly observing the state of the environment, performing actions, and remembering the history of what happened in it. The agent’s knowledge base consists of an action description part specifying the internal agent transitions, which are domain specific and not generic as in KGP. The knowledge base also contains what the agent observes in the environment including its own actions, as in KGP’s KB0. The temporal aspects of agent transitions are specified in the action language AL implemented in A-Prolog, a language of logic programs under the answerset programming semantics. The answer sets of domain specific programs specified in AL correspond to plans that in KGP are hypothetical narratives of the abductive event calculus. The control of the agent is based on a static observe-think-act cycle, an instance of the KGP cycle theories. A more recent and refined account of the overall approach has given rise to the AAA Architecture, see (Balduccini & Gelfond, 2008) for an overview.\nDALI (Costantini & Tocchio, 2004) is a logic programming language designed for executable specification of logical agents. Like KGP, DALI attempts to provide constructs to represent reactivity and proactivity in an agent using extended logic programs. A DALI agent contains reactive rules, events, and actions aimed at interacting with an external environment. Behaviour (in terms of reactivity or proactivity) of a DALI agent is triggered by different event types: external, internal, present, and past events. All the events and actions are time stamped so as to record when they occur. External events are like the observations in KGP, while past events are like past observations. However, KGP does not support internal events but has instead the idea of transitions that are called by the cycle theory to trigger reactive or proactive behaviour.\nIndiGolog (De Giacomo et al., 2001) is a high-level programming language for robots and intelligent agents that supports, like KGP, on-line planning, sensing and plan execution in dynamic and incompletely known environments. It is a member of the Golog family of languages (Levesque et al., 1997) that use a Situation Calculus theory of action to perform the reasoning required in executing the program. Instead in the KGP model we rely on abductive logic programming and logic programming with priorities combined with temporal reasoning. Instead of the Situation Calculus in KGP we use the Event Calculus for temporal reasoning, but our use of the Event Calculus is not a prerequisite of the model as in InterRaP (Müller, Fischer, & Pischel, 1998), but can be replaced with another temporal\nreasoning framework, if needed. Apart from the difference between the use of the Situation and Event Calculi, in IndiGolog goals cannot be decided dynamically, whereas in the KGP model they change dynamically according to the specifications in the Goal Decision capability.\nThere is an obvious similarity of the KGP model with the BDI model (Bratman et al., 1988) given by the correspondence between KGP’s knowledge, goals and plan and BDI’s beliefs, desires and intentions, respectively. Apart from the fact that the BDI model is based on modal logic, in KGP the knowledge (beliefs in BDI) is partitioned in modules, to support the various reasoning capabilities. KGP also tries to bridge the gap between specification and the practical implementation of an agent. This gap has been criticized in BDI by Rao (1996), when he developed the AgentSpeak(L) language. The computational model of AgentSpeak(L) has been formally studied by d’Inverno and Luck (1998), while recent implementations of the AgentSpeak interpreter have been incorporated in the Jason platform (Bordini & Hübner, 2005). Like the KGP implementation in PROSOCS (Bracciali et al., 2006), the Jason implementation too seeks to narrow the gap between specification and executable BDI agent programs. Jason also extends BDI with new features like belief revision (Alechina, Bordini, Hübner, Jago, & Logan, 2006).\nA particular line of work in BDI is that of Padgham and Lambrix (2005), who investigate how the notion of capability can be integrated in the BDI Logic of Rao and Georgeff (1991), so that a BDI agent can reason about its own capabilities. A capability in this work is informally understood as the ability to act rationally towards achieving a particular goal, in the sense of having an abstract plan type that is believed to achieve the goal. Formally, the BDI logic of Rao and Georgeff is extended to incorporate a modality for capabilities that constrains agent goals and intentions to be compatible with what the agent believes are its capabilities. A set of compatibility axioms are then presented detailing the semantic conditions to capture the desired inter-relationships among an agent’s beliefs, capabilities, goals, and intentions. The work also summarises how the extensions of the BDI model can be implemented by adapting the BDI interpreter to include capabilities, further arguing the benefits of the extension over the original BDI Interpreter of Rao and Georgeff (1992).\nIn KGP capabilities equate to the reasoning capabilities of an agent that allow the agent to plan actions from a given state, react to incoming observations, or decide upon which goals to adopt. However, in KGP, we do not use capabilities at the level of an agent’s domain specific knowledge to guide the agent in determining whether or not it is rational to adopt a particular goal.\nThe issue of the separation between specification and implementation exists between the KGP model and Agent0 (Shoham, 1993), and its later refinement PLACA (Thomas, 1995). Two other differences between the KGP and Agent0 and PLACA are the explicit links that exist in the KGP model amongst the goals (in the structuring of the forest in the agent state) and the richer theories in the KGP that specify priorities amongst potential goals which are not restricted to temporal orderings. These explicit links are exploited when revising goals and state, via the Revision transition, in the light of new information or because of the passage of time.\nThe BOID architecture (Broersen et al., 2001) extends the well known BDI model (Rao & Georgeff, 1992) with obligations, thus giving rise to four main components in representing an agent: beliefs, obligations, intentions and desires. The focus of BOID is to find ways of\nresolving conflicts amongst these components. In order to do so they define agent types, including some well known types in agent theories such as realistic, selfish, social and simple minded agents. The agent types differ in that they give different priorities to the rules for each of the four components. For instance, the simple minded agent gives higher priority to intentions, compared to desires and obligations, whereas a social agent gives higher priority to obligations than desires. They use priorities with propositional logic formulae to specify the four components and the agent types.\nThe existing KGP model already resolves some of the conflicts that BOID tries to address. For example, if there is a conflict between a belief and a prior intention, which means that an intended action can no longer be executed due to the changes in the environment, the KGP agent will notice this and will give higher priority to the belief than the prior intention, allowing the agent in effect to retract the intended action and, time permitting, to replan for its goals. The KGP model also includes a notion of priority used in the Goal Decision capability and the cycle theory that controls the behaviour of the agent. The KGP model has also been extended to deal with normative concepts, the extended model is known as N-KGP (Sadri, Stathis, & Toni, 2006). What N-KGP has in common with BOID is that it seeks to extend KGP with the addition of obligations. The N-KGP model also extends the notion of priorities by incorporating them amongst different types of goals and actions. A detailed comparison of N-KGP with related work is presented by Sadri, Stathis, and Toni (2006).\nThere are features that are included in some other approaches that are absent in the KGP model. BDI and, more so, the IMPACT system (Arisha et al., 1999; Subrahmanian et al., 2000) allow agents to have in their knowledge bases representations of the knowledge of other agents. These systems allow the agents both some degree of introspection and the ability to reason about other agents’ beliefs and reasoning. The KGP model to this date does not include any such features. IMPACT also allows the incorporation of legacy systems, possibly using diverse languages, and has a richer knowledge base language including deontic concepts and probabilities. Similarly, the 3APL, system is based on a combination of imperative and logic programming languages, and includes an optimisation component absent from the KGP. This component in 3APL includes rules that identify if in a given situation the agent is pursuing a suboptimal plan, and help the agent find a better way of achieving its goals. 3APL also includes additional functionalities such as learning (van Otterlo, Wiering, Dastani, & Meyer, 2003), which our model does not currently support. 2APL (Dastani et al., 2007) is an extension of 3APL with goals and goal-plan rules as well as external and internal events. 2APL has a customisable (via graphical interface) cycle which is fixed once customised."

      "text" : "We have presented the computational logic foundations of the KGP model of agency. The model allows the specification of heterogeneous agents that can interact with each other, and can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in such environments. KGP incorporates a highly modular agent architecture that integrates a collection\nof reasoning and sensing capabilities, synthesised within transitions, orchestrated by cycle theories that take into account the dynamic context and agent preferences.\nThe formal specification of the KGP components within computational logic has the major advantage of facilitating both a formal analysis of the model and a direct verifiable implementation. This formal analysis has been started by Sadri and Toni (2006), where we give a formal analysis of KGP agents by exploring their effectiveness in terms of goal achievement, and reactive awareness, and the impact of their reasoning capabilities towards progress in goal achievement. An implementation of a precursor of this model, described by Kakas et al. (2004b), has already been developed within the PROSOCS platform of Stathis et al. (2004) upon provably correct computational counterparts defined for each component of the model as given by Kakas et al. (2004b). Concrete choices for these computational counterparts have been described by Bracciali et al. (2004). The resulting development framework allows the deployment and testing of the functionality of the earlier variant of KGP agents. Deployment of these agents relies upon the agent template designed by Stathis et al. (2002), which builds upon previous work with the head/body metaphor described by Steiner et al. (1991) and Haugeneder et al. (1994), and the mind/body architecture introduced by Bell (1995) and recently used by Huang, Eliens, and de Bra (2001). This development platform has been applied to a number of practical applications, and, in particular, to ambient intelligence by Stathis and Toni (2004). Also, Sadri (2005) has provided guidelines for specifying applications using KGP agents. Future work includes implementing and deploying the revised KGP model given in this paper: we envisage that this will pose limited conceptual challenges, as we will be able to capitalise on our experience in implementing and deploying the precursor of this model.\nSadri, Stathis, and Toni (2006) have explored how the precursor of the KGP agent model can be augmented with normative features allowing agents to reason about and choose between their social and personal goals, prohibitions and obligations. It would be interesting to continue this work for the finalised KGP model given in this paper.\nSadri and Toni (2005) have developed a number of different profiles of behaviour, defined in terms of specific cycle theories, and formally proved their advantages in given circumstances. It would be interesting to explore this dimension further, to characterise different agent personalities and provide guidance, through formal properties, as to the type of personality needed for applications.\nFuture work also includes extending the model to incorporate (i) other reasoning capabilities, including knowledge revision (e.g. by Inductive Logic Programming), and more sophisticated forms of temporal reasoning, including identifying explanations for unexpected observations, (ii) introspective reasoning and reasoning about the beliefs of other agents, (iii) further experimentation with the model via its implementation, and (iv) development of a concurrent implementation."
