INTRODUCTION\nACOUSTIC models for speech recognition have advancedsubstantially over the past 25 years, but the front-end feature processing has been largely unchanged, based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) [1] and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features [2]. To a large degree this has been due to the use of acoustic models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) [3]–[5], which are well matched to feature representations which have decorrelated components and are relatively low-dimensional.\nDeep neeural network (DNN) acoustic models [6] address these limitations and have achieved significant reductions in word error rate (WER) across many speech recogniiton datasets [7]. Compared to the hybrid neural network / hidden Markov model (HMM) architecture studied in the early 1990s [8], [9], DNNs typically use more hidden layers and a wider output layer. Moreover, DNNs can be also used as a good feature extractor, for instance through the inference of bottleneck features which may append the features used in GMM-based speech recognition systems [10], [11]. However, in order to be compatible with GMMs using diagonal covariances, such augmented feature vectors must typically be relatively lowdimensional and decorrelated.\nWe have addressed the limitations of GMMs through an acoustic model based on probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) [12], which can employ higher dimensional, correlated feature vectors. PLDA is a probabilistic extension\nLiang Lu, and Steve Renals are with University of Edinburgh, UK; email: {liang.lu, s.renals}@ed.ac.uk\nThe research was supported by EPSRC Programme Grant EP/I031022/1 (Natural Speech Technology).\nof linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [13], which has been very well studied for speaker recognition in the joint factor analysis (JFA) [14] and i-vector [15]–[17] frameworks. A PLDA acoustic model factorizes the acoustic variability using HMM state dependent variables which are expected to be consistent across different acoustic conditions, and observation dependent variables which characterise per frame level acoustic changes [12]. Similarly to a subspace GMM (SGMM) [18], the factorisation is based on the inference of subspaces. However, while the SGMM uses a set of full covariance matrices to directly model the per frame acoustic variability, the PLDA model introduces another set of projections to model this variability in lower-dimension subspaces.\nWe have previously investigated using a PLDA mixture model for acoustic modelling [12], [19]. Though good results have been obtained, this model has a large number of HMM state dependent variables, and is thus prone to overfitting. In this letter we mitigate the problem by tying the PLDA state variables in PLDA, an approach analogous to the use of tied state vectors in SGMMs [18]."

      "text" : "The PLDA-based acoustic model is a generative model in which the distribution over acoustic feature vectors yt ∈ Rd from the j-th HMM state at time t is expressed as:\nyt|j = Uxjt +Gzj + b+ ǫjt, ǫjt ∼ N (0,Λ) . (1)\nzj ∈ Rq is the state variable (equivalent to the betweenclass identity variable in JFA) shared by the whole set of acoustic frames generated by the j-th state and xjt ∈ Rp is the frame variable (equivalent to the within-class channel variable in JFA) which explains the per-frame variability. Usually, the dimensionality of these two latent variables is smaller than that of the feature vector yt, i.e. p, q ≤ d. U ∈ Rd×p and G ∈ Rd×q are two low rank matrices which span the subspaces to capture the major variations for xjt and zj respectively. They are analogous to the within-class and between-class subspaces in the standard LDA formulation, but are estimated probabilistically. b ∈ Rd denotes the bias and ǫjt ∈ Rd is the residual noise which is assumed to be Gaussian with zero mean and diagonal covariance. By marginalising out the residual noise variable ǫjt, we obtain the following likelihood function:\np(yt|xjt, zj , j) = N (yt;Uxjt +Gzj + b,Λ) (2)\n2"

Given the latent variables xjmt and zjm, the state-level distribution over features is:\np(yt|j) = ∑\nm\nπjmN (yt;Umx̄jmt +Gmz̄jm + bm,Λm) .\nx̄jmt and z̄jm are point estimates of the latent variables. Since the projection matrices Um and Gm are globally shared, a large number of components can be used to improve the model capacity, e.g. M = 400 [12]."

      "heading" : "B. Tied PLDA",
      "text" : "To avoid overfitting in the PLDA mixture model, those components which are responsible for a small number of feature vectors may be deactivated. Alternatively, the state variables zjm may be tied across components, resulting in the following component distribution:\nyt|j,m = Umxjmt +Gmzj + bm + ǫjmt, (5)\nǫjmt ∼ N (0,Λm) . (6)\nTying the state variables may over-simplify the model. In this case, a “mixing-up” strategy can be used, analogous to SGMM sub-state splitting [18]:\nyt|j, k,m = Umxjkmt +Gmzjk + bm + ǫjkmt, (7)\nǫjkmt ∼ N (0,Λm) , (8)\nwhere k denotes the sub-state index, and zjk is the substate variable. This makes Tied PLDA model more scalable compared to PLDA mixture model as we can balance the number of the sub-state variables according to the amount of available training data. Tied PLDA is equivalent to SGMM if we remove the per-frame latent variable xjkmt and use full covariance Λm to model the residual noise. Given the latent variables, the state-level likelihood function can be written as\np(yt|j) = ∑\nmk\ncjk × πjmN (yt;Umx̄jmkt +Gmz̄jk + bm,Λm)\n= ∑\nmk\nwjkmN (yt;Umx̄jmkt +Gmz̄jk + bm,Λm) (9)\nwhere cjk is the sub-state weight, πjm is the component weight which is shared for all the sub-state models, and wjkm = cjk × πjm. This is different to an SGMM in which a weight projection matrix is used to derive the componentdependent weights:\npSGMM(yt|j) = ∑\nk\ncjk ∑\nm\nπjkmN (yt;Gmz̄jk,Σm) (10)\nπSGMMjkm = expwTmz̄jk ∑\nm′ expw T m′ z̄jk\n(11)\nwhere w denotes the weight projection matrix, and wm denotes its m-th column. We do not use softmax weight normalisation in order to simplify the model training; empirical findings (Section IV) indicates that linear normalisation works well. Tied PLDA also differs from the SGMM by using another subspace projection (matrix Um) to model feature correlations. It is more scalable to high dimensional feature inputs than the direct feature covariance modelling used in SGMMs."

      "text" : "For tied PLDA, the likelihood may be computed according to equation (9) by make use of the MAP estimates of the latent variables xjkmt and zjk , referred to as the point estimate in [12]. However, this approach does not work well in practice because of the large uncertainty of the estimation of xjkmt, i.e. the large variance of its posterior distribution.\nAnother approach is to marginalise out the observation variable xjkmt, which is referred as the uncertainty estimate in [12]. Using N (0, I) as a prior, which is the same prior used in model training for consistency (cf. equation(15)), this likelihood function can be obtained as\np(yt|j) = ∑\nmk\nwjkm\n∫\np(yt|xjkmt, j, k,m)P (xjkmt)dxjkmt\n= ∑\nmk\nwjkmN ( yt;Gmz̄jk + bm,UmU T m + Λm )\nThis method is similar to the channel integration evaluation method used for JFA based speaker recognition [20], [21]. Note that the likelihood can be efficiently computed without inverting matrices UmUTm + Λm directly, but by using the Woodbury matrix inversion lemma as in [20], [22]:\n(UmU T m + Λm) −1\n= Λ−1m − Λ −1 m Um(I+U T mΛ −1 m Um) −1UTmΛ −1 m (12) = Λ−1m − LL T (13)\nwhere L = Λ−1m Um(I + U T mΛ −1 m Um) −1/2. This makes it computationally feasible when yt is high dimensional.\nIt is also possible to marginalise out the state variable zjk alone or jointly with xjkmt similar to the methods used in [21]. However, we did not obtain a consistent improvement using this approach in our preliminary experiments. This may be the case because the variance of the posterior distribution of zjk is small owing to increased training data used for the posterior estimation. This model-based uncertainty approach is similar to Bayesian predictive classification (BPC) for GMM-based acoustic models [23], in contrast to feature space uncertainty approaches used for noise robust speech recognition [24]–[26]."

To take advantage of longer context information, for the GMM and SGMM systems we have also performed experiments using spliced MFCC 0 of differing context window size, followed by a global LDA transformation to reduce the feature dimensionality to be 40, and a global semi-tied covariance (STC) matrix transform [31] to decorrelate the features. The PLDA systems directly used the concatenated MFCCs with various size of context window, without de-correlation and dimensionality reduction.\nTable I shows the results of using a 33 hour subset of the training data, and the number of active model parameters3. In this case, there are about 2,400 clustered triphone states in the GMM systems, corresponding to about 30,000 Gaussians. The PLDA and SGMM systems have a similar number of clustered\n1https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu 2http://kaldi.sourceforge.net 3For PLDA systems, a component is considered active if its weight is above\na threshold (0.01 in this work).\n4\ntriphone states, and a 400-component background model is used for each. The state vector of SGMMs and latent variables of PLDA are all 40-dimensional. We used 20,000 sub-state vectors and state variables in the SGMM and tied PLDA systems, respectively. These results demonstrate the flexibility of PLDA systems in using different dimensional acoustic features, i.e. the spliced MFCC 0 without any frontend feature transformations. Tied PLDA systems also offer consistently lower WERs than their counterparts based on the PLDA mixture model. Using the same low dimensional features as MFCC 0(±3)+LDA STC, the tied PLDA system achieved comparable recognition accuracy to SGMMs. This system is better than tied PLDA systems using spliced MFCC 0 of various context windows, which means that removing the nondiscriminative dimensions in feature space is still beneficial to tied PLDAs."

Using a larger bottleneck layer was not found to be helpful [19]. We concatenated the bottleneck and MFCC 0+∆+∆∆ coefficients (referred as BN MFCC), and then used them to retrain our GMM and PLDA systems. We used LDA to reduce the dimensionality of the concatenated features from 65 to be 40 followed by STC to de-correlate the features for GMM and SGMM systems. Without the front-end feature transforms, the PLDA systems were able to achieve comparable or higher recognition accuracy by directly capturing the correlations between MFCCs and bottleneck features in subspaces.

Experiments show that this model can achieve higher recognition accuracy while still enjoying the flexibility of using acoustic features of various dimension as the PLDA mixture model. Other types of acoustic feature representations can be more freely explored using this acoustic model. Along this line, we have demonstrated that the bottleneck feature from a DNN can used without any front-end feature transformation for dimensionality reduction and de-correlation. Future works include speaker adaptation and discriminative training for this model, and moreover, we are also interested in learning speech representations in an unsupervised fashion using a deep auto-encoder for this model.
