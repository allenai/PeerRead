Opinion mining and sentiment analysis have found vast application in analysing online ratings, analysing product based reviews, e-governance, and managing hostile content over the internet. This paper proposes an algorithm to implement aspect level sentiment analysis. The algorithm takes input from the remarks submitted by various teachers of a student. An aspect tree is formed which has various levels and weights are assigned to each branch to identify level of aspect. Aspect value is calculated by the algorithm by means of the proposed aspect tree. Dictionary based method is implemented to evaluate the polarity of the remark. The algorithm returns the aspect value clubbed with opinion value and sentiment value which helps in concluding the summarized value of remark.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 11:05:29 GMT  (437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7519v1", "IJCSIT, MAY 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "IJCSIT, MAY 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["deepali virmani", "vikrant malhotra", "ridhi tyagi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7519"}
