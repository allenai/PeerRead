      "text" : "Parallel corpus which contains source documents and their translations plays an important role in multilingual information service [1], such as Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), and machine translation (MT). However, parallel corpus is scarce resources and not easy to be obtained in some under-resourced languages or special domains. Due to these shortcomings, building and using comparable corpora is often a more feasible option. It is obviously easier to find document collections with similar topics in multiple languages than to find parallel corpus [2]. The Web, with its vast volumes of data, offers a natural source for this. For example, bilingual website, and online Wikipedia, are very good resources for collecting and obtaining\ncomparable data. Meanwhile, comparable data extracted from these resources can update with the increasing of the source data, and then more new words can be extracted easily and accurately. Therefore, building and using comparable corpora is becoming more and more important and urgent.\nComparability is the key concept in the research of comparable corpus. However, so far there has been no widely accepted definition of comparability. Different definitions or metrics methods of comparability might be given to suit various NLP tasks. In the task of machine translation, comparability is focused on distribution and quality of translated knowledge [3]. In multilingual terminology extraction, comparability is focused on distribution and quality of the vocabulary of translated forms [4].\nSo far, method of based word frequency list has been always used to measure corpus homogeneity and similarity between corpora [5]. This method is useful for measure corpus similarity in the respect of comparing the different language styles, however, this method perform badly in the task of bilingual term extraction. In our previous experiments, we verify this point.\nA new comparability, namely, termhood-based metrics, especially used for comparability metrics of comparable corpus in special domain, is proposed in this paper. Experiments results show that this method performs better than traditional frequencybased metrics in the task of bilingual term extraction. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, related works are introduced. Then the termhoodbased metrics is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents the experiment results and the proposed method is evaluated according to the task of bilingual terminology extraction in section 5. The paper is concluded with a summary and directions for future works."

Leturia et al. (2009) used search engine queries for collecting comparable corpora from the Internet [7]. Otero and L´opez exploited Wikipedia for collecting domain comparable corpora by using categories as topic restrictions [8].\nIn our previous experiments, we used three different Internet data source for collecting comparable corpus: querying bilingual domain keywords in search engine, exploiting the online encyclopedia-Wikipedia, and searching academic databases. At last, we choose data from academic databases as our experiment corpus for its suitable size and quality."

      "heading" : "2.2 Comparability metrics of comparable corpus",
      "text" : "In order to evaluate the quality of comparable corpus, we need some way to measure the degree of comparability of the comparable corpus. The most used metrics of comparable corpus are Chi-square statistics and word similarity. Leturia et al. used these two methods to measure the comparability of domain-specific comparable corpora obtained from the Internet by using search engine [2]. One method is calculating the cosine value between the vectors containing all the keywords of each corpus; the other is calculating Chi-square statistics for the most N frequent keywords (Top-N keywords). The ACCURAT (Analysis and evaluation of Comparable Corpora for Under Resourced Areas of Machine Translation) project used asymmetric Chi-square statistics to measure comparability [9]. The TTC (Terminology Extraction, Translation Tools and Comparable Corpora) project concentrate on two dimensions for comparability calculation: one is similarity between anchor texts in its own language; the other is dissimilarity between anchor points texts in two corpora [10].\nThe aforementioned works are based on word frequency lists. This kind of method is simple and effective for measure language style. However, this method performs poor between different domain corpora. In our previous investigation, we find this method can’t distinguish different domain-specific corpus efficiently.\nLi and Gaussier purposed a metrics of comparable corpus for bilingual lexicon extraction [11]. Given a comparable corpus P consisting of an English part Pe, and a French part Pf , the degree of comparability of P is defined as the expectation of finding the translation of any given source/target word in the target/source corpus vocabulary. This method needs a bilingual dictionary for mapping between two corpora. Thus the size and quality of dictionary may heavily affect the result of comparability measure.\nIn this paper, we propose termhood-based comparability metrics, according to bilingual terminology extraction task. It is noted that our method is oriented to bilingual terminology. It is in this point that our method is different to Li et al [11], which is oriented to bilingual lexicon. As for comparability of domain-specific comparable corpora, our method, based on termhood calculating, is more suitable to highlight terminology."

Termhood is defined as degree of terminolgy to be term in a specific field. Quality of term can be measured by termhood and distribution of words be measured by ranking list of word weighting. So, we proposed termhood-based comparability metrics. In this method, words are ranked by termhood not frequency, and then the cosine similarities are calculated based on the ranking lists of word termhood. The similarity obtained is used as comparability of comparable corpus."

Kit and Liu proposed a measure for mono-word termhood in terminology of such peculiarity and quantify it in terms of a word’s ranking difference in a domain and background corpus [16]. We use this method to measure the termhood of terminology. We use People’s Daily corpus of 1998 from January to June as background corpus and Library and information (LIS) corpus as domain corpus. Given a domain corpus D (with a vocabulary VD) and a background corpus B (with a vocabulary VB), the termhood of a word w is defined as formula (1).\nWhere r (w) is the ranking number of word w in a corpus in question, |VD|,| VB | is the size of domain and background corpus respectively. A word rank is normalized by the vocabulary size of its corpus in order to make the word ranks in two corpora comparable.\nB\nB\nD\nD\nV (w)rV (w)r)Termhood(w = (1)\n(2) Comparability of termhood-based metrics in comparable corpus According to the termhood, word lists are ranked in descending order.

It is assumed that comparability of comparable corpus lies between parallel and non-comparable corpus. In our experiments, the domain of parallel corpus is Library and Information Science (LIS), obtained from abstracts of records from CNKI database; comparable corpus is also LIS domain, collected from two aforementioned academic databases.

In the experiments, the comparability of each kind of comparable corpus is computed based on termhood-based and traditional frequency-based metrics respectively.\n(1) Frequency-based metrics Word was ranked based on their frequency in the corpus, and then comparability was calculated by cosine value between two vectors represented by words and their frequency. In the experiment, word frequency is normalized because there is some difference between size of Chinese corpus and English corpus. Experiments were carried out for six different corpus sizes, i.e. Top100, Top200, Top500, Top1000, Top2000 and Top5000 respectively.\n(2) Termhood-based metrics\nThe comparability metrics based on termhood computes word termhood by corpus comparison method after word frequency statistic. Then words vectors are generated based on their termhood. Finally comparability was calculated by cosine value between two vectors represented by words and their termhood. In this method we also compute comparability metrics in six different corpus sizes, i.e. Top100, Top200, Top500, Top1000, Top2000, and Top5000.\nBesides, keywords and all words were both used in our experiments for comparison.

However, it is assumed that comparability of comparable corpus should be in the middle of the two; parallel, comparable, non-comparable, comparability of three kinds of corpus should present an even decreasing trends. In comparison, termhood-based approach reflects this point more obviously.\nThe performance of frequency-based method for all word is presented in Fig.3. As a whole, it reflects the fact that comparability of parallel corpus > comparability of non-comparable corpus> comparability of comparable corpus. This is against with our hypothesis. Moreover, this result is inconsistent with frequency-based method using keywords. Furthermore, we can also find that comparability of these kinds of corpus\nis very close to each other, all above 0.9. It is likely that there are so many noisy words that results are affected, further cause incorrect or incredible results.\nThe performance of termhood-based method for all word is presented in Fig.4. Notice that comparability of parallel corpus > comparability of comparable corpus> comparability of non-comparable corpus; comparability of three kinds of corpus present an even decreasing trends. Furthermore, these results using all words are consistent with using only keywords.\nAccording to the above analysis, we can conclude that: according to reflecting the real comparable degree between corpora, termhood-based method is better than frequency-based method. Meanwhile, the results of termhood-based method using keywords are consistent with the situation of using full-text words. It also shows that termhood-based method is more stable and reliable than frequency-based method.

These corpora are parallel corpus, comparable corpus and non-comparable corpus respectively.

For Chinese corpus: segmentation and part of speech.

We use Top@N method to evaluate the result of bilingual terminology extraction. That is, for every Top@N English terminology together with N candidate Chinese terms, if there is one is the right translation, we consider the result is correct. Here we take 10 for N. In the evaluation criteria of human judgments, if translation relation is completely correct, the score of matching will be 1; partly correct, score will be calculated by dice coefficient [20]; completely incorrect, score will be zero.\ntokensofnumber ofsum\n*2Dice overlaps= (2)"

Notice that the overall similarity of term pairs is increasing with the growth of comparability.\nAccording to table 2, the overall degree of matching obtained by machine discrimination is not always increasing with the growth of comparability. In fact, machine discrimination is carried out with the help of dictionary of LDC. As far as we know, LDC’s dictionary is a general dictionary which only includes about 80, 000 pairs bilingual lexicons, but the corpus in our experiments is corpus in special domain. So it is inevitable that there is some deviation because of limited size of bilingual dictionary. Therefore, human evaluation is very necessary. Notice that the overall degree of matching obtained by human judgments is increasing with the growth of comparability.\nWe can also find out that the overall degree of matching, no matter machine or human, is very low. This could well be due to the limited size and quality of bilingual dictionary, small size of our experimental corpus, or the bias caused by parameter settings in terminology extraction based on context vector method. At the same time, the overall similarity of terminology pairs is only related to terminology frequency. It is not affected by other factors. Therefore the result should be more reliable than the overall degree of matching.\nIn summary, we can conclude that the overall similarity of term pairs and the overall degree of matching is increasing with the growth of comparability. Accordingly, we can learn that high comparability of corpus generate high quality bilingual terminology. This also shows that our termhood-based method of comparability is effective in the application of bilingual terminology extraction."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusions and Future Works",
      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed termhood-based method to measure comparability of comparable corpus. Experiment results showed that this method performs better than traditional frequency-based method. It is likely to be that the candidate terms are ranked more reasonable because of constrain of termhood. It is possible that this method is less affected by common words, and it considers quality of term in special domain, so its performance is more stable and better in the task of terminology Extraction.\nExperiments also show that results of comparability are more reliable when using keywords not full-text in the frequency-based method. This is because when using full-text data after preprocessing, there are so many common words that they influence the rank lists, further causing inaccurate results. Regardless of keywords or fulltext data, the results are consistent in the termhood-based method. This again shows that termhood method has a better stability than frequency method.\nAlong the direction of our current work there are some directions for future works. One is to measure the effectiveness of termhood-base method in a more fine-grained comparable level. Another piece of work is to filter out the stop and common words after calculating word frequency, and then calculates the similarity of two words sequence; and finally we can make a comparison between this improved frequencybased method and termhood-based approach."

Besides, these resources are just limited to a few languages, such as English, French, and Spanish and so on. So, obtaining comparable corpora automatically for such domains could be an answer to this problem effectively. Comparable corpora, that the subcorpora are not translations of each other, can be easily obtained from web. Therefore, building and using comparable corpora is often a more feasible option in multilingual information processing. Comparability metrics is one of key issues in the field of building and using comparable corpus. Currently, there is no widely accepted definition or metrics method of corpus comparability. In fact, Different definitions or metrics methods of comparability might be given to suit various tasks about natural language processing. A new comparability, namely, termhood-based metrics, oriented to the task of bilingual terminology extraction, is proposed in this paper. In this method, words are ranked by termhood not frequency, and then the cosine similarities, calculated based on the ranking lists of word termhood, is used as comparability. Experiments results show that termhood-based metrics performs better than traditional frequency-based metrics.",
