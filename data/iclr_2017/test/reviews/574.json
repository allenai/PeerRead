Defining similarity among arbitrary fashion-products is still remains a challenging problem, even there is no exact ground-truth. To resolve this problem, we define more than 90 fashion-related attributes, and combination of these attributes can represent thousands of unique fashion-styles. We then introduce to use the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) recognising multi fashion-attributes with the end-to-end manner. To build our system at scale, these fashion-attributes are again used to build an inverted indexing scheme. In addition to these fashion-attributes for semantic similarity, we extract colour and appearance features in a region-of-interest (ROI) of a fashion item for visual similarity. By sharing our approach, we expect active discussion on that how to apply current deep learning researches into the e-commerce industry.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The manuscript is a bit scattered and hard to follow.

The exploration is interesting and the paper does a nice job of discussing the challenges of operating in this domain. The proposed approach addresses several of the challenges. \n\nHowever, there are several concerns.\n\n1) The main concern is that there are no comparisons or even mentions of the work done by Tamara Berg\u2019s group on fashion recognition and fashion attributes, e.g., \n-  \u201cAutomatic Attribute Discovery and Characterization from Noisy Web Data\u201d ECCV 2010 \n- \u201cWhere to Buy It: Matching Street Clothing Photos in Online Shops\u201d ICCV 2015,\n- \u201cRetrieving Similar Styles to Parse Clothing, TPAMI 2014,\netc\nIt is difficult to show the contribution and novelty of this work without discussing and comparing with this extensive prior art.\n\n2) There are not enough details about the attribute dataset and the collection process. What is the source of the images? Are these clean product images or real-world images? How is the annotation done? What instructions are the annotators given? What annotations are being collected? I understand data statistics for example may be proprietary, but these kinds of qualitative details are important to understand the contributions of the paper. How can others compare to this work?\n\n3) There are some missing baselines. How do the results in Table 2 compare to simpler methods, e.g., the BM or CM methods described in the text?\n\nWhile the paper presents an interesting exploration, all these concerns would need to be addressed before the paper can be ready for publication.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Good practical visual search system but lack novelty", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper introduces a pratical large-scale visual search system for a fashion site. It uses RNN to recognize multi-label attributes and uses state-of-art faster RCNN to extract features inside those region-of-interest (ROI). The technical contribution of this paper is not clear. Most of the approaches used are standard state-of-art methods and there are not a lot of novelties in applying those methods. For multi-label recognition task, there are other available methods, e.g. using binary models, changing cross-entropy loss function, etc. There aren't any comparison between the RNN method and other simple baselines. The order of the sequential RNN prediction is not clear either. It seems that the attributes form a tree hierarchy and that is used as the order of sequence.\n\nThe paper is not well written either.
