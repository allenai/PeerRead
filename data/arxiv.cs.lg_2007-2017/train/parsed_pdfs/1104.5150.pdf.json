We consider that SRCs are static and have some similar and regular connection behavior.

      "text" : "Today, one of the biggest issues for Mobile Operators is to provide acceptable indoor coverage for wireless networks. Among the several in-building solutions, the femto cell is the one which is gaining significant interest. A femto cell is a small cellular base station characterized by low transmission power, limited access to a closed user group designed for residential or small business use. But its expansive buying cost is not motivating to purchase it. This solution could help operators solve localized coverage problems and extend their network. Indeed, in some areas where the macro network signal is weak, a network of open femto cells access would significantly improve the voice quality and data connectivity. This would be feasible if access points owners accept to be part of a Club where each member is willing to open up its access point\n1This work is supported by the COMET project AWARE. http://www.ftw.at/news/project-start-for-aware-ftw\nar X\niv :1\n10 4.\n51 50\nv1 [\ncs .N\nI] 2\n7 A\npr 2\n01 1\nto the other members. This idea of sharing part of its bandwidth started with FON2, a club where members share their WiFi connection and inspired us to propose a Club where members share their femto accesses with bandwidth guarantees. A femto club member could share its 3G/LTE signal securely with other club members. Incentives for an owner of an access point to be member of such a club can be not only to share a part of the cost of the access point but also to make advertisement or to share some information through a specific social network associated to the club. These incentives would logically lead the club to manage by itself only such bandwidth exchange, but since this technology uses licensed spectrum, the only model that could for the moment be adopted for sharing femto access is the one where the mobile operator is also participating. Sharing femto access is a service proposed by the Mobile Operator to its clients. These customers are divided into service providers customers (SPCs) and service requesters customers (SRCs) : SPCs are the owners of femto cells accesses for which they have contracted with a Mobile operator denoted by MO. SRCs are customers using a mobile terminal in an area covered by some SPCs access points and requesting to use these access points. Note that a user can be both a SPC and a SRC. Dynamic femto spectrum sharing is a challenging problem for all the actors. Indeed the amount of requested bandwidth by SRCs as well as the amount of bandwidth shared by SPCs and pricing should be determined such that the utility of all the agents is maximized. Since the interests of all the actors could be antagonist, especially between many SRCs requesting a same SPC, we model our system as a game to determine equilibria of such situations.\nRelated works The problem of sharing bandwidth and pricing has been already addressed by Dusit Niyato et al [2], then modeled as a game. The challenging problem in this context is that bandwidth sharing requires a peaceful co-existence of both primary and secondary users. The femto access sharing we present in this article is similar but takes also into account both of SRCs and SPCs profiles.\nThe potential games introduced by Rosenthal [8] are classical games having at least one pure Nash equilibrium. These games have a potential function such that each of its local optimums corresponds to a pure Nash equilibrium. This property has been used for congestion game in general (see [6] for a survey), with Resource Reuse in a wireless context (see [1]) and for a real-time spectrum sharing problem with QoS provisioning [10].\nA decentralized learning algorithm of Nash equilibria in multi-person stochastic games with incomplete information has been presented by M.A.L. Thathachar et all. In the considered game, the distribution of the random payoff is unknown to the players and further none of the players know the strategies or the actual moves of other players. It is proved that all stable stationary points of the algorithm are Nash equilibrium for the game [7]. The study presented in this article will use this algorithm in the game restricted to SRCs where each SRC will learn the strategy maximizing its gain using only local information. We will check whether if the stationary point the algorithm converges to is a pure Nash equilibrium.\nOur contribution. Section 2 presents the model for sharing femto access and the actors involved in this model are described. The game considering only SRCs competition is presented in Section 3. Section 4 details the principle of a distributed algorithm used to learn the game NE if any exists and some simulations results are given in Section 4.4. Finally, Section 5 draws a general conclusion and gives some perspectives.\n2FON is a for-profit company incorporated and registered in the U.K. FON was created in Madrid, Spain, by Martin Varsavsky, an Argentine/Spanish entrepreneur and founder of many companies in the last 20 years."

      "text" : "Now, we present the model for sharing femto access. Our system is composed of SPCs and SRCs. SPCs share some amount of bandwidth with SRCs. We assume that there exists a Token Based Accounting Protocol to exchange services between SRCs and SPCs against tokens [3]. On one hand, the paradigm for spectrum sharing should guarantee a certain access speed and a data transmission speed. On the other hand, the model should propose a type of connection (that would be more expansive than others) which guarantees QoS to SRCs: connections belonging to this type will never be canceled by the SPC.\nOur work considers a unique SPC denoted by X and several SRCs. We assume that the SPC’s resource reserved for sharing is an amount of bandwidth denoted by BS(X). Then, we will consider that each SRC Y requests connection from X . Actually, the bandwidth BS(X) of SPC X is divided into two parts:\nBS(X) = BSG(X) +BSY (X)\n• BSG(X) is the part of bandwidth in which SRCs communications can never be preempted. It is kind of a guaranteed QoS allocated to SRCs.\n• BSY (X) is the part of bandwidth in which SRCs communicatiosn can be preempted. This preemption is due to the fact that the SPC has priority on this part of bandwidth. Thus, a communication allocated in BSY (X) is characterized by a risk of preemption.\nFigure 1 introduces the sharing bandwidth process and the billing process in both cases of a Green and a Yellow connection allocation: let’s consider a SRC Y who needs an amount of bandwidth equal to bw. bw will be allocated to Y only if it is free. If X will need bw, he will not be able to use it if the connection he allocated to Y is green. However, he will be able to preempt the connection allocated to Y if it is a yellow one.\nWe assume that there exists a Token Based Accounting Protocol to exchange services between SRCs and SPCs against tokens (representing money) [3]. The billing process depends on whether the SRC has used a green connection or a yellow one.\nIn the case of a Green connection, the SRC will spend N1 tokens corresponding to the used bandwidth bw. In the case of a Yellow connection, the SRC will spendN2 (N2 < N1) tokens if the connection succeed. Indeed, the yellow connection is cheaper than the green one due to the risk of preemption. If the yellow connection given to the SRC has failed, this connection will be free."

These two parameters are dual: µ+ Γ = 1.\nThe Gain sensitivity parameter indicates its sensitivity degree to the price of the connection shared while the QoS sensitivity parameter indicates the SPC’s tolerance degree towards preemption risk. The more a SPC\nis sensitive to gain, the bigger its green part bandwidth will be because of its expansive selling price. The more a SPC is sensitive to QoS, the bigger its Yellow Part bandwidth will be since he does not want to be preempted by SRCs. When µ > 1/2, we say that the SPC is sensitive to gain.

For SRCs, the utility depends on their requests, the other SRCs requests as well as the SPC’s decision (bandwidth allocated and type of connection) for a fixed SPC’s bandwidth split. So, the SRC’s utility depends mainly on its competition with other SRCs to receive some bandwidth from the same SPC.\n2. For the SPC, the utility depends on its bandwidth split for fixed SRCs requests. Since we consider only one SPC, no competition is needed for the SPC to rise its utility.\nIn our work, we will only focus on the competition between SRCs when the SPC’s bandwidth split is fixed."

      "text" : "Since only the competition between SRCs is considered, sharing femto access problem could be thus modeled as a game whereN SRCs are the players. We also consider that the SPC’s bandwidth split is fixed. This could be motivated by the fact that learning methods are reliable only when the surrounding environment is invariant. We do not consider the mobility of SRCs. However, we assume that SRCs have some regular and similar connection behavior: each SRC requests the SPC’s connection in nearly same time slots with almost invariant needs in terms of QoS. This means that requesting the SPC’s femto access becomes almost routine for SRCs. This could be seen as repeated games.\nAlong requested connections, each SRC will learn, thanks to an algorithm running in a software embedded in its user equipment, the best strategy to be played to maximize its gain. In this article, sharing femto access game will be denoted by the game restricted to SRCs.\nThe game restricted to SRCs is defined as follows: given a fixed SPC’s bandwidth split (into green part and yellow part), what would be the best strategy to be played by SRCs in order to have a stable situation where the strategy of each SRC player is optimal for him considering the other SRCs strategies. This situation corresponds to a pure Nash equilibrium in game theory. Recall that a pure Nash equilibrium of a game is a situation where, for each player, there is no unilateral strategy deviation that increases its utility [5]."

      "heading" : "3.1.1 SRCs QoS needs",
      "text" : "Each SRC’s QoS needs depend on the type of application he requests. Requesting for femto access is equivalent to request an amount of bandwidth. Fixing this amount of bandwidth depends on the following parameters: the type of application (real time, elastic), the QoS parameter that the applications requires (delay, time transfer file, . . . ), the type of connection (Green or Yellow) and the SRC’s profile (QoS sensitive SRC or price sensitive SRC).\nOur work takes into account the File Transfer Application. QoS is defined as the time transfer file that we will denote by t. The SRC’s QoS satisfaction is related to t. For each SRC, the time transfer file should be between T1 and T2 and is defined as follows:\n• Case t = T1: BWMax corresponds to the required bandwidth to download a file in t = T1. If the SPC provides an amount of bandwidth equal to BWMax, then the SRC’s QoS satisfaction is at the top.\n• Case t = T2: BWMin corresponds to the required bandwidth to download a file in t = T2. If the SPC provides an amount of bandwidth equal to BWMin, then the SRC’s QoS satisfaction is minimal.\nEach SRC will request for a minimum amount of bandwidth and a maximum amount of bandwidth in Green and Yellow depending on its profile and on its user equipment Signal-Strength towards the SPC’s femto cell.\nAll the SRCs requests can not be accepted. In fact, since the SPC’s bandwidth is limited and since several SRCs could request for the SPC’s connection at the same time, one possible response that a SRC\ncould receive is a deny one. Requesting for a Minimum and a Maximum amount of bandwidth will decrease the chances to receive such a response. Besides, requesting a bandwidth interval generalizes the fact of requesting a fixed amount of bandwidth. In this way, a SRC could receive an amount of bandwidth which may be different from its optimal request but would avoid him to have no payoff.\nThe minimum and the maximum amount of bandwidth are fixed depending on the SRC’s profile. Note that the parameters caracterizing a SRC’s profile are real in [0, 1]. We aim at translating these parameters into intervals of bandwidth requests which are actually integers. So, we introduce a parameter ε representing the discretization of the bandwidth resquested. Let SSRCibe the set of possible strategies of SRCi. In the following, we focus on the request of a SRC denoted by SRCi according to its profile.\n1. We consider the case where SRCi has its QoS sensitive parameter αi greater than 1/2. SRCi fixes a revenue threshold under which he denies any proposed connection (high QoS degradation). This threshold denoted byRev Thi corresponds to a minimum amount of bandwidth to be requested. This parameter depends on the QoS sensitivity αi of the SRC. Rev Thi = αi − κ where κ ∈ [0, 1] is the allowed variation from the QoS degradation tolerance fixed according to the SRC’s profile (more specifically αi).\nSSRCi = {Rev Thi, Rev Thi + ε,Rev Thi + 2ε, . . . , 1}.\n2. We consider the case where SRCi has its QoS sensitive parameter αi less than 1/2. This implies that its price sensitive parameter βi is greater than 1/2. SRCi fixes a cost threshold denoted by Cost Thi above which he denies any proposed connection (the cost is beyond what he is able to pay). This threshold corresponds to a maximum amount of bandwidth to be requested. This parameter depends on the QoS sensitivity of the SRC and is defined as follows: Cost Thi = αi + κ.\nSSRCi = {Cost Thi, Cost Thi − ε, Cost Thi − 2ε, . . . , 0}.\nEach element si of SSRCi permits to define an interval of bandwidth to be requested in Green and Yellow connection. This represents a couple (gi = [mGi ,M G i ], yi = [m Y i ,M Y i ]) of couples of integers. The parameters mXi ,M X i represent respectively the minimum and the maximum amount of bandwidth to be requested in X connection where X ∈ {G, Y }. They are defined as follows :\n1. Case where SRCi has its QoS sensitive parameter αi greater than 1/2:\n(a) mGi = BWmax si and mYi = BWmax si × (1− δ) (b) MGi = BWmax and M Y i = BWmax\n2. Case where SRCi has its QoS sensitive parameter αi less than 1/2.\n(a) MGi = BWmax si and MYi = BWmax si × (1− δ) (b) mGi = BWmin and m Y i = BWmin\nFigure 2 highlights an example of a QoS sensitive SRC (α = 0.7) and Figure 3 gives an example of a price sensitive SRC (α = 0.3). They show the minimum and the maximum amount of bandwidth to be requested in Green and Yellow for one of the SRC’s strategies."

Each SRC will compute its utility following sol(Π).\nWe will repeat all these steps till convergence of Algorithm Adist. We will denote by Π∗ the SRC strategy profile for which Adist converges.

In [3], it has been proved that if the considered game has at least one pure Nash equilibrium and if there exists a sufficiently small value of the learning speed parameter for which the distributed learning algorithm converges, then the point of convergence of this algorithm is a pure Nash equilibrium. We say that this algorithm weakly converges to a Nash equilibrium.\n4.2 ALGORITHM Adist Algorithm Adist is a decentralized learning algorithm of Nash equilibrium in multi-person stochastic games with incomplete information. The principle of Adist is described as follows:\nWe consider that the strategic process for each SRC player follows a discrete learning technique.\n• Each SRCi will update its strategy at a step t denoted by sti following its local mixed strategy (probability distribution assigned to each available pure strategy). Each SRCi will thus compute its new probability vector st+1i using only a set of local information (s t i, margin t i, gain t i) where gain t i rep-\nresents the gain from the SPC’s allocation decision and marginti is the pure strategy in SSRCi\n• At each step t, each SRC chooses randomly one strategy (marginti) and increases its probability of choosing this strategy(sti) according to its gain (gain t i) and a learning parameter b ∈ [0, 1] which\nmodulates the learning speed of the different SRCs players.\nThe learning technique is based on the following update rule:\nIf j 6= marginti then s t+1 i,j = s t i,j − b.uti.sti,j\nelse st+1i,j = s t i,j − b.uti. ∑ k 6=marginti sti,k\nSuch that: uti = gainti−Ati Uti−Ati is the normalized utility. The variables (U ti = maxk≤tgain k i ) and (A t i = maxk≤tgain k i ) correspond respectively to the maximum utility and the minimum utility of SRCi at iteration t. Note that it is possible to consider Ati = 0\nThe aim from using this update rule is the following: each SRC player lowers the probabilities associated to margins not played at the step t by the same percentage. The sum of these percentages is then added to the probability associated to the margin played at step t.\nAs mentioned in Theorem 1, in the game restricted to SRCs, there is at least one pure Nash equilibrium. In this article, we will try to answer the following questions: Does Adist converge? Is the point of convergence if any exists a pure Nash equilibrium? Is this algorithm reliable for Nash equilibrium computation?"

In order to make the system representing this game converge more rapidly, we will propose two solutions: In the first one, we consider that the system is stable if all the SRCs have a strategy with a probability equal to p (0 < p < 1).\nIf we fix p = 0.8, the software set up in the user equipment of SRC1, SRC2, SRC3 and SRC4 needs respectively 90, 90, 200 and 340 initiated connections to learn the strategy maximizing its gain. After 340 iterations, the system is considered as stable. Thus, the number of iterations forAdist convergence is reduced by 32%.\nThe second solution does not reduce the number of iterations for Adist convergence, but proposes to reduce its time duration (could also be seen as the number of requested connections). This solution is based on the fact of triggering the learning process several times per connection requested. This means that for a connection of duration D, the SRC’s software will choose a new strategy following the updated strategy probability vector each d=q*D slot time (q ∈ [0, 1]). Thus, the time duration (the number of requested connections) necessary for Adist convergence is reduced by q.\nWe have focused on the convergence of Adist taking into consideration several strategies per SRC and 2 ≤ N ≤ 8. We have found that Adist always converges to one among the pure Nash equilibriums detected analytically in the SRCs payoff matrix. To conclude, Adist permits to learn the game restricted to SRCs’ pure Nash equilibrium whatever the SRCs profiles are."

We have checked that this result is available for a number of SRCs varying from 2 to 8 for SRCs with exactly 2 strategies or more than 2 strategies. The distributed algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations. Two solutions has been proposed to reduce the number of requested connections necessary for this algorithm convergence. The distributed learning algorithm running in SRCs user equipments gives at convergence the minimum and the maximum amount of bandwidth to be requested by each SRC in Green and Yellow."

Only the competition between SRCs is modeled as a game considering a fixed SPC’s bandwidth split. Our simulations focus on examples where SRCs objectives conflict: SRCs belonging to the same category of QoS sensitive SRCs.\nSimulations have proved the efficiency of the Distributed Learning Algorithm: even if each SRC player has only local information, the algorithm always converges to a pure Nash equilibrium.\nAs a perspective, we will consider the sharing femto access game with several SRCs and several SPCs. The sharing femto access problem will thus be divided into two levels: a first level representing a game restricted to SRCs and a second level representing a game restricted to SPCs. We will study the properties of the second level game to check whether if they match with the game restricted to SRCs’ properties. We will also focus on the convergence time optimization of the algorithm ADist applied on both SRCs game and SPCs game."

The operators are interested in solving their localized coverage and capacity problems in areas where the macro network signal is not able to serve the demand for mobile data. Thus, the major issue for operators is to find the best solution at reasonable expanses. The femto cell seems to be the answer to this problematic. In this work1, we focus on the problem of sharing femto access between a same mobile operator’s customers. This problem can be modeled as a game where service requesters customers (SRCs) and service providers customers (SPCs) are the players. This work addresses the sharing femto access problem considering only one SPC using game theory tools. We consider that SRCs are static and have some similar and regular connection behavior. We also note that the SPC and each SRC have a software embedded respectively on its femto access, user equipment (UE). After each connection requested by a SRC, its software will learn the strategy increasing its gain knowing that no information about the other SRCs strategies is given. The following article presents a distributed learning algorithm with incomplete information running in SRCs software. We will then answer the following questions for a game with N SRCs and one SPC: how many connections are necessary for each SRC in order to learn the strategy maximizing its gain? Does this algorithm converge to a stable state? If yes, does this state a Nash Equilibrium and is there any way to optimize the learning process duration time triggered by SRCs software?
