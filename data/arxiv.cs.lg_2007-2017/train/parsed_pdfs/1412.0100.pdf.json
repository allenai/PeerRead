      "text" : "The central problem of constructing an object detector can be decomposed into learning a confidence detection response function and estimating a search strategy. Most frequently, confidence functions are learned in a fully supervised setting, and the search is performed exhaustively. This approach is however not well suited to contemporary stateof-the-art systems, which are trained using large amounts of image or video data, and require complex multi-layer models[14]. First, manually annotating the large amounts of data needed by supervised algorithms is increasingly expensive. This underlines the need to exploit alternative sources\nof information to support system accuracy and efficiency. Second, the target search complexity is sometimes high in many practical object detection applications.\nHuman eye movements can provide a rich source of supervision which, due to recent developments in eyetracking hardware, is increasingly less invasive and expensive. Large scale datasets annotated with human eye movements under various task constraints have recently been acquired and made public[17, 18, 20]. Such data has been exploited at training time to support visual classification performance in video[17], but its usefulness as a training signal for detection, in the absence of any additional annotations, remains unexplored. Nor has detection performance benefited from insights derived from the ‘saccade-and-fixate’ operating principles of the human visual system.\nIn this paper, we propose general methods to learn detector confidence functions and search models from weak supervisory signals, circumventing the need for manual image annotations. Our main contributions are:\n• We demonstrate a novel segmentation-based constrained multiple instance model to learn effective action detectors in static images. Our method is trained using image labels and associated eye movement data and requires no ground truth annotations of the spatial extent of the targets, e.g. bounding boxes or image segments (see §5 and tables 2,3,4).\n• We show, for the first time, that human eye movement information can be integrated with image labels to train more accurate image classification pipelines. The performance of our system approaches that of pipelines trained under the stronger supervision of target bounding box information (see §5 and table 4).\n• We develop a weakly supervised reinforcement learning methodology to obtain optimal sequential models that operate in a fixate-and-saccade regime.

      "text" : "Many methods have been proposed to accelerate detectors. Prominent techniques are based on branch-and-bound heuristics[13, 15], hierarchies of classifiers[25] or methods that reuse computation between neighboring regions[28]. In turn, different features have been used in the design of the detector response functions. Deep convolutional neural networks have surpassed methods based on support vector machines on many computer vision problems, such as the image classification[14], object classification[19], object detection[12], action classification[19] and pose prediction[24]. Multiple instance learning[8] formulations can be seen as a generalization of supervised learning, in which class labels are assigned to sets of training examples. Many algorithmic solutions have been proposed, based on SVMs[3, 4], CRFs[26] or boosted classifiers[1] (see [2] for a review).\nDatasets of human eye movement have been collected for both images and video. Search targets include pedestrians[9], faces [7] and actions[17, 18, 20]. Eye movements have successfully been used to boost the performance of computer vision systems, such as action classification from video[17, 27, 11], action detection from video[22] or image segmentation[21]. Some of these systems assume the availability of eye movement data at test time[27, 21], while some do not[17, 11, 22]. Human eye movements have also been recently used to learn object detectors by Papadopoulos et al.[20]. Their method employs supervised learning techniques to predict a bounding box given the human’s scanpath, then reduces to a classical supervised detection learning problem, in which the predicted bounding boxes play the role of ground truth annotations. However, ground truth bounding box information must still be available, at least for a subset of the training images. This can be a limiting factor in many practical applications. In this work, we take a markedly different approach. Instead of splitting the problem into two learning steps, we treat it as a joint optimization problem, recovering both the ground truth regions and the confidence function in a single stage. Unlike [20], our method does not require the availability of ground truth bounding boxes at training time.\nVisual analysis systems based on fixate-and-saccade ideas have been proposed in [16, 5, 18], for the problem of digit recognition[16], face detection[5] and saccade prediction[18]. Here, we derive novel, fully trainable models for two challenging problems, namely action recognition and detection in cluttered natural scenes, and in a reinforcement optimal learning setup[23]."

      "heading" : "3. Action Detection in Static Images",
      "text" : "Given an image showing one or more persons, we want to determine both the actions present (from a predefined list) and their corresponding spatial support. The spatial support is more difficult to objectively define for an action, than it is for an object. Here, we consider the spatial support of an action to be a tight bounding box that encloses both the human actor and the additional objects the action requires. For example, the spatial support for an instance of the action playing guitar is a bounding box that tightly encloses both the artist and the instrument (see fig. 1).\nWe are not aware of any publicly available dataset suited for this problem. While the Pascal VOC Action Classification Challenge[10] contains a large set of images with human actions, the provided annotations are not useful for action detection for several reasons. First, not all action instances are annotated. Second, many images contain crowds of people performing actions (e.g. images from running competitions), with many overlapping targets. These images are incompletely annotated and make the evaluation of an action detector subjective. Third, not all actions are suitable for detection given the image statistics: the extent of many actions is often the entire image, making spatial localization uninteresting (e.g. playing piano or using desktop computer).\nWe address this problem by providing our own complete annotations for a subset of the PASCAL VOC Actions 2012 database1. Our dataset contains 4412 images and 10 action classes: jumping, phoning, playing guitar, reading, riding bike, riding horse, running, walking and using laptop. Note that our action classes are slightly different than in the PASCAL VOC Actions dataset. We have specialized the classes playing instrument and using computer, to keep the extent of the action within bounds that make detection non-trivial. We have also removed all images containing crowds that perform the same action, but are only sparsely annotated.\n1Our annotations will be made publicly available upon publication."

      "text" : "Given an input image, we formulate action detection as the problem of maximizing a confidence function fc : R→ R over the set of image regions R:\nr∗ = argmax r∈R fc(r) (1)\nThe set of image regions R can be defined either at the coarse level of bounding boxes or at the finer level of image segments. In the present work, the region space R consists of all segments extracted using the CPMC algorithm[6]. There are two reasons that motivate our choice. First, the space of image segments is several orders of magnitude smaller than the one of bounding boxes. Second, figureground image segments produced by CPMC can be mapped with reasonable accuracy to objects or groups of related objects that represent human actions (see table 1, column 3). Furthermore, as shown in §5.1, humans often fixate segments that well match the target during visual search. Hence, for action detection, image segments provide a good tradeoff between computational complexity and spatial descriptive power.\nTypically, the confidence function fc is learnt from a training set of images annotated with ground truth regions containing the target instances (usually bounding boxes). This type of annotation is however expensive to obtain in practice. An alternative, cheaper ‘annotation’ consists of sequences of eye movements made by human subjects searching for the target, together with a label indicating the presence or absence of the target class in images. In §5, we present a method to learn the confidence function fc from this information only, without the need for region-level annotations.\nWhen looking at an image, the human visual system exhibits efficient search strategies that only explore a few locations before deciding on the presence of a target. When asked to locate an action, humans take on average only 3.6 fixations (stdev=1.8) in the PASCAL VOC Actions 2012 dataset. In §6 we present a model to learn efficient search strategies in an weakly supervised setting, optimally formulated in a reinforcement learning setup. Our model operates in a fixate-and-saccade regime, inspired from the workings of the human visual system."

In this section we consider the more challenging setup in which no ground truth image regions are available at\ntraining time. Instead, our training signal consists of image labels – indicating the presence or absence of an action in the image – and eye movements recorded from human subjects asked to locate instances of the target action (see fig. 1). Such data has been recently acquired and made publicly available[18].\nIn §5.1 we begin with a brief analysis of the localization power of human eye movements. In §5.2, we describe our method in detail. We evaluate the model and discuss experimental results in §7.1."

      "text" : "The sequence of fixations and saccades made by a human subject is precisely registered with the image but contains weaker information on the location and extent of the search target compared to a bounding box or a segment. Consider for example the case of a human presented with an image of a concert scene where one of the artists is playing a guitar. Typically the last few fixations fall onto relevant parts of the target, i.e. the person and the musical instrument. However, the remaining part of the scanpath is most likely focused on the background and other objects or humans.\nHow weak is the localization signal provided by human fixations? Table 1 lists the percentage of fixated image segments in the Pascal VOC Actions 2012 dataset. It also shows the maximum overlap between a fixated image segment and the ground truth bounding box. Both figures are averaged over all images belonging to an action class. The analysis suggests that, while fixations do not give precise information on the location of the search target, they can serve as a strong filtering signal over the entire segment pool."

      "text" : "Based on the analysis in §5.1, we develop a multiple instance learning formulation, in which training instances\nare the image regions ri obtained by a segmentation algorithm on the training set, referenced in a global index set I . In a one-vs-all formulation, training image with index j ∈ J is represented by (1) a bag Bj ⊂ I of region indexes belonging to image j and (2) an associated image label lj ∈ {−1, 1}.\nA positive bag Bj corresponds to an image where the target action is present and contains all regions fixated by humans viewing that image. Some of these regions represent the detection target, and some do not. Negative bags Bj correspond to images where the action is absent, and contain all regions in that image (fixated or not). We know that none of these regions represents the detection target.\nWe wish to simultaneously find the optimal assignments yi of labels to instances and the optimal separating hyperplane for the positive and negative instances under this assignment, subject to several constraints: Positivity constraints: There should be at least one positive instance inside each positive bag, and no positive instances inside negative bags. Inclusion constraints: Positivity constrains implicitly encourage good separation of positive bags from negative bags, under their maximum classifier response. This does not imply, however, good localization performance.\nConsider, for example, a classifier that responds to the presence of some pattern strongly associated to the target, anywhere inside the input region. This classifier cannot distinguish among image regions containing the target. It will separate positive and negative bags well, but will have poor localization capabilities. We deal with this issue by imposing that, for any region that is positively labeled, all its subregions S(r) be labeled negative. We define the set S(r) using a soft threshold criterion:\nS(r) = {r′ s.t. |r ∩ r′| / |r′| ≤ TS} (2) Unconstrained fringe: Previous experience with training sliding window detectors[19] has shown that excluding bounding boxes overlapping the ground truth from the set of negative examples can greatly improve the localization power. We define the fringe F(r) of region r as the set of regions that overlap r, down to a threshold: F (r) = {r′ s.t. (r′ 6= r) ∧ (|r ∩ r′| / |r ∪ r′| ≥ TF )} (3)\nIn our formulation, regions in the fringe of instances selected as positive do not affect the separating hyperplane and their corresponding labels are constrained to be 0.\nThis leads to the following formulation:\nmin yi min w,b,ξ\n1 2 ‖w‖2 + C ∑ i ξi (4)\ns.t. ∀i ∈ I : yi ∈ {−1, 0, 1} (4.1) ∀i ∈ I : yi = 1 =⇒ (∀k) ∈ F (ri), yk = 0 (4.2) ∀i ∈ I : yi = 1 =⇒ (∀k) ∈ S(ri) \\ F (ri), yk = −1 (4.3) ∀i ∈ I : yi 6= 0 =⇒ yi ( wT g (ri) + b ) ≥ 1− ξi, ξi > 0 (4.4)\n∀j ∈ J : lj = 1 =⇒ (∃) i ∈ Bi s.t. yi = 1 (4.5)\n∀j ∈ J : lj = −1 =⇒ (∀)i ∈ Bj , yi = −1 (4.6)\nwhere g : R → Rn is a feature extractor that takes as input an image region.\nNote that if we remove constraints (4.2), (4.3), and the value 0 for the range of possible image labels from constraint (4.1), we end up with the miSVM formulation[3], which treats all training instances as independent from one another.\nAlgorithm 1 Constained Multiple Instance SVM learning 1: procedure CMI-SVM({ri}i∈I , {Bj , lj}j∈J ) 2: yi ← rand({−1, 1}) 3: repeat 4: (w, b)← SVM({ri, yi}yi 6=0) 5: for j ∈ J do 6: if lj = 1 then 7: V ← Bj ; npos ← 0 8: repeat 9: r ← maxi∈V wT g (ri) 10: k ← argmaxi∈V wT g (ri) 11: if r > 0 then 12: yk ← 1; npos ← npos + 1 13: yi ← −1, for each i ∈ S(rk) 14: yi ← 0, for each i ∈ F (rk) 15: V ← V \\ (F (rk) ∪ S(rk)) 16: else 17: yk ← 0 18: V ← V \\ {k} 19: end if 20: until V = ∅ 21: if npos = 0 then 22: k ← argmaxi∈Bj wT g (ri) 23: yk ← 1 24: end if 25: else 26: yi ← −1, for each i ∈ Bj 27: end if 28: end for 29: until y has not changed during the iteration 30: return w, b,y 31: end procedure\nWe solve the optimization problem (4) using an iterative procedure, presented in Algorithm 1.

      "text" : "When faced with a recognition task, the human visual system has evolved eye movements to sequentially sample promising image regions through an alternation of saccades and fixations. Inspired by the exceptional, yet unmatched, performance of this biological system, we develop a principled optimal sequential model for image exploration.\nAt each time step t, based on the information gathered so far, our model proposes an image location zt that should be sampled. Then, the model updates its internal state st based on information contained in the image regions in the neighbourhood of the sampled location. At each time step, the model may terminate the search. In this case, it returns its confidence for the target’s presence in the image, together with a region hypothesis for spatial support.\nWe now describe in detail the state and action spaces of our model (fig. 2). Model description: At each time step t, the model keeps track of a set Ht ⊆ R of image regions observed so far, deciding on the appropriate action to take in three steps: Termination decision: The model may decide to terminate search (dt = 1). This decision is based on a feature vector of four elements, which consists of the maximum confidence over the set of regions visited so far, the number of saccades already generated, the number of image regions observed so far and a bias:\nv (st) = [ max r∈Ht fc(r) t ‖Ht‖ ‖R‖ 1 ]> (5)\nThe search termination probability is given by a soft threshold applied to a linear combination of these features, with learned weights θd:\npθ(dt = 1|st) = sigm [ θ>d v (st) ] (6)\nwhere sigm(x) = (1 + e−x)−1 is the sigmoid function. Evidence selection: If the search is not terminated (dt = 0), the model selects an observed image region et ∈ (Ht \\ St) that provides clues for the location of the target. For example, an image region consisting of the upright torso of a person found in the upper half of the image may offer cues for the presence of a horse in the bottom part.\nTo capture such effects, we define an evidence function fe : B → R, fe (i) = exp ( θ>e g(ri) ) that evaluates the informativeness of image region i with respect to the target location. We select the region et from a multinomial distribution defined by the evidence function over the set Ht \\St of image regions not selected during previous steps:\npθ(et|st) = fe(et)∑\ni∈Ht\\St fe(i) (7)\nLocation selection: Once selected, the evidence region et is used to define a 2d Gaussian probability distribution for the next fixation location zt ∈ R2:\npθ(zt|st, et) = N (·, fp(et),θΣ) (8)\nwhere the center fp(et) is based on a linear combination of the evidence region features g(et):\nfp(i) = [ θ>p g(ri) ] · x2(ri)− x1(ri)\n2 +\nx1(ri) + x2(ri)\n2 (9)\nWe make the position function invariant to the scale of the image region ri by normalizing with respect to its bounding box, defined by the top-left and bottom right corners x2(ri) and x1(ri).\nThe policy of our agent can be expressed as:\nπθ (at|st) = pθ (dt = 0|st) pθ (et|st) pθ (zt|st, et) (10)\nThe model is executed by repeated sampling of the policy πθ (at|st), until termination (dt = 1) (Algorithm 2). At each step the state st is updated according to the action at (Algorithm 3). When the search is finished, the observed region rk with maximum confidence ct is returned as detector output. Training algorithm: In our weakly supervised setting, we are given a set of images, represented as bags of regions Bj with associated global image labels lj , together with confidence function fc trained to be maximal at target locations, either with strong or weak supervision, c.f . §5.2. We wish to\nfind the model parameters θ maximizing image-level classification accuracy based on the confidence ct at the last step (when dt = 1), while at the same time minimize the number of segment evaluations. Note that because the confidence response ct of the agent is the maximal confidence function response, we also encourage good detection performance.\nWe formulate our training objective in a reinforcement learning framework. Our reward function is sensitive to the confidence at the final state and incurs a penalty for each saccade the agent makes:\nrt =  −α if dt = 0 min(ct, 1) if dt = 1 ∧ l = 1 max(ct,−1) if dt = 1 ∧ l = −1\n(11)\nwhere l is the label associated with the training image over which the model was executed and α is a penalty paid by the model for each saccade.\nDuring training, we maximize the expected reward function on the training set, defined as:\nF (θ) = Epθ(s)  |s|∑ t=1 rt + λ 2 θ>θ (12)\nwhere s represents a variable length sequence of states, sampled by running the model (Algorithm 2 and 3), starting from an initial state s0 = (H0, S0) and λ is an L2 regularizer. We set H0 to the set of segments observed by fixating the image center and S0 to ∅.\nThe gradient of the expected reward can be approximated as[29, 23]:\n∇θF (θ) = 1\nM M∑ i=1 |si|∑ t=1 ∇θlogπθ(ait|sit)  |s|∑ t=1 rt + λθ (13)\nwhere si, ait and r i t, i = 1 . . .M , represent sequences of states, actions and corresponding rewards, sampled by model simulation."

      "text" : "Our confidence function (CMI-EYE-DET) is trained on the set of image regions fixated by human subjects, as described in §5.1. For positive images, where bags consist of fixated segments, we create additional negative bags consisting of all segments not overlapping any fixated segment. We use threholds TS = TF = 0.2 to define the fringe and subregions c.f . (2) and (3). For initialization, we generate 30 random label assignments y, with the ratio of positive/negative labels uniformly sampled from the range [0.1, 1.0]. Our model generally converges in less than 20 iterations. We evaluate the SVM-C parameter on the validation set, and re-train on trainval. We then evaluate our confidence function on all segments extracted from each test image. Detector responses for each image are generated by non-max suppression at overlap threshold 0.2. Features: We use the deep convolutional neural network of Krizhevskyet al.[14] as feature extractor g. Given an image segment, we first compute its bounding box and enlarge it by 10%. We then apply the neural network twice to produce our feature descriptor. First, we apply it on the contents of the bounding box (after proper scaling). Second, to capture context, we consider the entire image, mask the bounding box by filling it with its mean color, rescaled and passed\nthrough the network. For each call we record the output of the last fully connected layer, and end up with two vectors of 4096 real values. Additionally, we build a representation of the bounding box that consists of its normalized image coordinates, size and aspect ratio. Our final feature vector consists of the two concatenated neural response vectors and the bounding box descriptor, and has 8204 entries. Baselines: We compare our method to three baselines: Supervised learning (BB-DET): We train a confidence function where positive examples are the image segments with the highest target overlap (see table 1, column 3), the fringe of these segments is removed from the training set, and the rest of the segments are negative examples. Multiple instance learning (MI-EYE-DET): To capture the contribution of our topological constraints to model performance, we train our confidence function on the set of fixated segments in a similar fashion to CMI-EYE-DET, without constraints (4.2), (4.3), restricting the range of possible image labels in constraint (4.1) to {−1, 1}. Image labels alone (CMI-IL-DET): To estimate the power of eye movements as a supervisory signal, we also investigate the setup in which only image labels are available at training time. To this end, we train our model on bags composed of the entire segment pool for the corresponding image, as returned by CPMC. Evaluation: We first evaluate our models under the VOC detection average precision metric, in which a segment is considered a hit if its bounding box overlaps the ground truth bounding box with at least 0.5 overlap.\nNote however that our ground truth bounding boxes contain both the person and the manipulated object. The distinctive pattern that defines an action is often a subregion within this bounding box, e.g. the person’s hands grasping the guitar consistent with playing or the person’s head and the mobile phone close to her ear (see fig. 3). While precisely defining annotations for these patterns is not trivial, we also evaluate our methods on a metric that counts detector responses falling within the predicted bounding box as correct, regardless of the overlap. Under this metric, a segment is a hit if its bounding box falls within the subregion\nset (2) of the ground truth bounding box, with TS = 0.5. We also evaluate image level classification, by computing the maximum confidence of the trained detector for each image, and reporting classification average precision over the images in the test set. Results: Our method (CMI-EYE-DET) outperforms both baselines under all metrics (tables 2, 3 and 4). There is a larger performance gap between supervised and weakly supervised approaches when measured under the average precision metric, than under a less restrictive inclusion metric. This suggests, that weakly supervised approaches recover invariant patterns within the bounding box, although, at least in the absence of prior knowledge, cannot easily estimate the full extent of the actor and person. Our visualizations of the results (fig. 3) also support this intuition.\nThe contribution of topological constraints to the multiple instance learning quality is substantial under all metrics. Additionally, leveraging human eye movement annotations produces image classifiers nearly as good as those learned under full supervision. The standard MI-EYE-DET pipeline fails to exploit the human eye movement training signal for image classification, showing that our proposed topological constraints are crucial for this task."

    "abstractText" : "State-of-the-art visual recognition and detection systems increasingly rely on large amounts of training data and complex classifiers. Therefore it becomes increasingly expensive both to manually annotate datasets and to keep running times at levels acceptable for practical applications. In this paper, we propose two solutions to address these issues. First, we introduce a weakly supervised, segmentation-based approach to learn accurate detectors and image classifiers from weak supervisory signals that provide only approximate constraints on target localization. We illustrate our system on the problem of action detection in static images (Pascal VOC Actions 2012), using human visual search patterns as our training signal. Second, inspired from the saccade-and-fixate operating principle of the human visual system, we use reinforcement learning techniques to train efficient search models for detection. Our sequential method is weakly supervised and general (it does not require eye movements), finds optimal search strategies for any given detection confidence function and achieves performance similar to exhaustive sliding window search at a fraction of its computational cost.",
