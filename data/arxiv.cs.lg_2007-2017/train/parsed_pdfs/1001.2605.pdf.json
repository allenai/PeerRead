      "text" : "MANIFOLD learning has drawn great interests sinceit was first proposed in 2000 ( [1], [2], [4]) as a promising nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR) method for high-dimensional data manifolds. Its basic assumption is that high-dimensional input data samples lie on or close to a low-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in the ambient Euclidean space. For example, by rotating the camera around the same object with fixed radius, images of the object can be viewed as a one-dimensional curve embedded in a high-dimensional Euclidean space, whose dimension equals to the number of pixels in the image. With the manifold assumption, manifold learning methods aim to extract the intrinsic degrees of freedom underlying the input highdimensional data samples, by preserving local or global geometric characteristics of the manifold from which\n• H.

In recent years, various manifold learning algorithms have been proposed, such as locally linear embedding (LLE) [2], [3], ISOMAP [4], [5], Laplacian eigenmap (LE) [12], diffusion maps (DM) [14], local tangent space alignment (LTSA) [11], and Riemannian manifold learning [13]. They have achieved great success in finding meaningful low-dimensional embeddings for high-dimensional data manifolds. Meanwhile, manifold learning also has many important applications in real-world problems, such as human motion detection [17], human face recognition [18], classification and compressed expression of hyper-spectral imageries [19], dynamic shape and appearance classification [20], and visual tracking [21]–[23]. However, a main drawback of the manifold learning methods is that they learn the low-dimensional representations of the high-dimensional input data samples implicitly. No explicit mapping relationship from the input data manifold to the output embedding can be obtained after the training process. Therefore, in order to obtain the low-dimensional representations of the new coming samples, the learning procedure, containing all previous samples and new samples as inputs, has to be repeatedly implemented. It is obvious that such a strategy is extremely time-consuming for sequentially arrived data, which greatly limits the application of the manifold learning methods to many practical problems, such as classification, target detection, visual tracking and detection. In order to address the issue of lacking explicit mappings, many linear projection based methods have been proposed for manifold learning by assuming that there exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional\n2 input data samples and their low-dimensional representations, such as Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) [24], [25], Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) [26], Neighborhood Preserving Projections (NPP) [27], Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projections (OLPP) [28], Orthogonal Neighborhood Preserving Projections (ONPP) [29], [30], and Graph Embedding [31]. Although these methods have achieved their success in many problems, the linearity assumption may still be too restrictive.\nOn the other hand, several kernel-based methods have also been proposed to give nonlinear but implicit mappings for manifold learning (see, e.g. [32]–[35]). These methods reformulate the manifold learning methods as kernel learning problems and then utilize the existing kernel extrapolation techniques to find the location of new data samples in the low-dimensional space. The mappings provided by the kernel-based methods are nonlinear and implicit. Furthermore, the performance of these methods depends on the choice of the kernel functions, and their computational complexity is extremely high for very large data sets.\nIn this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is proposed for the first time, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial mapping from the high-dimensional input data samples to their lowdimensional representations. The proposed mapping has the following main features.\n1) The mapping is explicit, so it is straightforward to locate any new data samples in the lowdimensional space. This is different from the traditional manifold learning methods such as like LLE, LE, and ISOMAP [4] in which the mapping is implicit and it is not clear how new data samples can be embedded in the low-dimensional space. Compared with kernel-based mappings, the proposed mapping does not depend on the specific kernels in finding the low-dimensional representations of new data samples. 2) The mapping is nonlinear. In contrast to the linear projection-based methods which find a linear projection mapping from the input high-dimensional samples to their low-dimensional representations, the proposed mapping provides a nonlinear polynomial mapping from the input space to the reduced space. Clearly, it is more reasonable to use a polynomial mapping to handle with data samples lying on nonlinear manifolds. Meanwhile, our analysis and experiments show that the proposed mapping is of similar computational complexity with the linear projection-based methods.\nCombining this explicit nonlinear mapping with existing manifold learning methods (e.g. LLE, LE, Isomap) can give explicit manifold learning algorithms. In this paper, we concentrate on the LLE manifold learning method and propose an explicit nonlinear manifold learning algorithm called Neighborhood Preserving Polynomial Embedding (NPPE) algorithm. Experiments\non both synthetic and real-world data have been conducted to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed mapping. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a brief review of the existing manifold learning methods including those based on linear projections and kernel-based nonlinear mappings. Details of the explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning are presented in Section 3, whilst the NPPE algorithm is given in Section 4. In Section 5, experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real-world data sets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. Conclusion is given in Section 6."

Locally Multidimensional Scaling (LMDS) [9] preserves local pairwise Euclidean distances among data samples. Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) [10] also preserves pairwise Euclidean distances in each local neighborhood, but it maximizes the variance of the low-dimensional representations at the same time. Local Tangent Space\n3 Alignment (LTSA) [11] keeps the local tangent structure. Diffusion Maps [14] preserves local pairwise diffusion distances from high-dimensional data to the lowdimensional representations. Laplacian Eigenmap (LE) [12] preserves the local adjacency relationship.\nAs global approaches, Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) [4], [5] preserves the pairwise geodesic distances among the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional representations. Hessian Eigenmaps (HLLE) [15] extends ISOMAP to more general cases where the set of intrinsic degrees of freedom may be non-convex. In Riemannian Manifold Learning (RML) [13], the coordinates of data samples in the tangential space are preserved to be their low-dimensional representations."

      "heading" : "2.3 Out-of-Sample Nonlinear Extensions for Manifold Learning",
      "text" : "Besides linear projections for manifold learning, several out-of-sample nonlinear extensions are also proposed for manifold learning in order to get low-dimensional representations of unseen data samples from the learned manifold. These methods are based on kernel functions and extrapolation techniques. A common strategy taken by these methods is to reformulate manifold learning methods as kernel learning problems. Then extrapolation techniques are employed to find the location of new coming samples in the low-dimensional space from the learned manifold. Bengio et al. [32], [36] proposed a unified framework for extending LLE, ISOMAP and LE, in which these methods are seen as learning eigenfunctions of operators defined from data-dependent kernels. The data-dependent kernels are implicitly defined by LLE, ISOMAP LE and are used together with the Nyström formula [38] to extrapolate the embedding of a manifold learned from finite training samples to new coming samples for LLE, ISOMAP and LE (see [32], [36]). Chin and Suter [35] investigated the equivalence between MVU and Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) [39], by which extending MVU to new samples is reduced to extending a kernel matrix. In their work [35], the kernel matrix is generated from an unknown kernel eigenfunction which is approximated using Gaussian basis functions. A framework was proposed in [33]\nfor efficient kernel extrapolation which is based on a matrix approximation theorem and an extension of the representer theorem. Under this framework, LLE was reformulated and the issue of extending LLE to new data samples was addressed in [33]."

Compared with the linear projection assumption used previously, a polynomial mapping provides high-order approximation to the unknown nonlinear mapping and therefore is more accurate for data samples lying on nonlinear manifolds. In order to apply this explicit nonlinear mapping to manifold learning algorithms, we need two definitions from matrix analysis [40].

In the experiments, the simplified version of NPPE is implemented and compared with NPP [27] and ONPP [30] (which apply the linear and orthogonal linear projection mapping to the training procedure for LLE, respectively) as well as the kernel extrapolation (KE) method proposed in [33]. There are two parameters in the NPPE algorithm, the number k of nearest neighbors and the polynomial\ndegree p. k is usually set to be 1% of the number of training samples, and the experimental tests show that NPPE is stable around this number. The choice of p depends on the dimension m. When m is small, p can be large to make NPPE more accurate. When m is large, p should be small to make NPPE computationally efficient. Experiments show that NPPE with p = 2 is already accurate enough."

      "text" : "In the first experiment, NPPE, NPP, ONPP and LLE are applied to the task of unfolding surfaces embedded in R3. The surfaces are the SwissRoll, SwissHole, and Gaussian, all of which are generated by the Matlab Demo available at http://www.math.umn.edu/∼wittman/mani/. On each manifold, 1000 data samples are randomly generated for training. The number of nearest neighbors is k = 10 and the polynomial degree p = 2. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 1. In each sub-figure, Z = [z1 z2 · · · zN ] stands for the generating data such that xi = φ(zi), where φ is the nonlinear mapping that embeds Z in R3. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that NPPE outperforms all the other three methods, even the LLE method itself. NPP and ONPP fail to unfold these nonlinear manifolds (except for ONPP on Gaussian). Furthermore, in order to estimate the similarity between the learned low-dimensional representations and the generating data, the residual variance [4] ρ(Y, Z) = 1−R2(Y, Z) is computed, where R is the standard linear correlation coefficient taken over all entries of Y and Z . The lower ρ(Y, Z) is, the more similar Y and Z are. The estimation results are shown in Fig. 1(d). It can be seen that the embedding given by NPPE is the most similar one."

      "text" : "In the second experiment, we apply NPPE, NPP, ONPP and KE to locating new coming samples in the learned low-dimensional space. First, 2000 data samples which evenly distribute on the SwissRoll manifold are generated. Then 1000 samples are randomly selected as the training data to learn the mapping relationship from R\n3 to R2 by NPPE, NPP, ONPP and KE. The learned mappings are used to provide the low-dimensional representations for the rest 1000 samples. The time cost of computing the low-dimensional representations of the testing samples is also recorded. Experimental results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that NPPE not only gives the best locating result but also has much lower time cost than KE. NPP and ONPP are faster for computation but fail to give the correct embedding result. The same experiment is also conducted on data samples randomly selected from SwissRoll. The results are shown in Fig. 3. NPPE also outperforms the other three methods. To further validate the performance of NPPE, we randomly generate 11000 samples on the SwissRoll\n8 manifold, 1000 for training and 10000 for testing. The experimental procedure is just the same as the preceding one. Time cost versus number of testing samples is shown in Fig. 4(a). The residual variances between the generating data of the testing samples and their lowdimensional representations given by the four methods, are illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The experimental results show that NPPE is more accurate than all the other three methods with a similar computational cost with NPP and ONPP. Note that, in all the above experiments, the time cost of KE is increasing linearly with the number of testing samples increasing, whilst that of NPP, ONPP and NPPE is almost the same with the increase of the number of testing samples."

      "text" : "In the last experiment, NPPE is applied to extract intrinsic degrees of freedom underlying two image manifolds, the lleface [2] and usps-0.\nThe lleface consists of 1965 face images of the same person at resolution 28×20, and the two intrinsic degrees of freedom underlying the face images are rotation of the head and facial emotion. We randomly select 1500 samples as the training data and 400 samples as the testing data. The number of nearest neighbors is set to be 15. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 5. The training and testing results are shown on the left and right columns, respectively, in Fig. 5. 100 training samples and 40 testing samples are randomly selected and attached to the learned embedding. It can be seen that NPPE and NPP have successfully recovered the underlying structure of lleface, while the result given by KE is not satisfactory. The rotation degree is not extracted by the learned embedding with KE. Time cost on locating new data samples by these three methods is shown in Fig. 7(a). The time cost of NPPE is higher than that of NPP but lower than that of KE, which supports the analysis of computational complexity in Section 4.2.\nThe usps-0 data set consists of 765 images of handwritten digit ‘0’ at resolution 16 × 16, and the two underlying intrinsic degrees of freedom are the line width and the shape of ‘0’. 600 samples are randomly selected as training data and 150 samples are chosen to be testing data. The number of nearest neighbors is set to be 5. Fig. 6 illustrates the experimental results. Training and testing results are shown on the left and right columns, respectively. 100 training samples and 20 testing samples are randomly selected and shown in the learned embedding. It can be seen that NPPE has successfully recovered the underlying structure, while it is hard to see the changes of line width and shape in the embedding given by KE and ONPP. Time cost on locating new data samples by these three methods is shown in Fig. 7(b). The time cost of NPPE is higher than ONPP but much lower than KE."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is proposed for the first time. Based on the assumption that there is a polynomial mapping from the high-dimensional input samples to their low-dimensional representations, an explicit polynomial mapping is obtained by applying this assumption to a generic model of manifold learning. Furthermore, the NPPE algorithm is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique with a explicit nonlinear mapping, which tends to preserve not only the locality but also the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional data samples. NPPE can provide convincing embedding results and locate new coming data samples in the reduced lowdimensional space simply and quickly at the same time. Experimental tests on both synthetic and real-world data have validated the effectiveness of the proposed NPPE algorithm."

    "abstractText" : "Manifold learning is a hot research topic in the field of computer science and has many applications in the real world. A main drawback of manifold learning methods is, however, that there is no explicit mappings from the input data manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and target detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for manifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an approximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too restrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for manifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial mapping between the highdimensional data samples and their low-dimensional representations. As far as we know, this is the first time that an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this to the method of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) and derive an explicit nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, named Neighborhood Preserving Polynomial Embedding (NPPE). Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed mapping is much more effective in preserving the local neighborhood information and the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional data samples than previous work.",
