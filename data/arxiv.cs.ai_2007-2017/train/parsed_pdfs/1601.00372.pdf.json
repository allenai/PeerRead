We introduce an alternative objective function for neural MT that maximizes the mutual information between the source and target sentences, modeling the bi-directional dependency of sources and targets. We implement the model with a simple re-ranking method, and also introduce a decoding algorithm that increases diversity in the N-best list produced by the first pass.

      "text" : "Sequence-to-sequence models for machine translation (SEQ2SEQ) (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sennrich et al., 2015a; Sennrich et al., 2015b; Gulcehre et al., 2015) are of growing interest for their capacity to learn semantic and syntactic relations between sequence pairs, capturing contextual dependencies in a more continuous way than phrase-based SMT approaches. SEQ2SEQ models require minimal domain knowledge, can be trained end-to-end, have a much smaller memory footprint than the large phrase tables needed for phrase-based SMT, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in large-scale tasks like English to French\n(Luong et al., 2015b) and English to German (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2014) translation.\nSEQ2SEQ models are implemented as an encoder-decoder network, in which a source sequence input x is mapped (encoded) to a continuous vector representation from which a target output y will be generated (decoded). The framework is optimized through maximizing the log-likelihood of observing the paired output y given x:\nLoss = − log p(y|x) (1)\nWhile standard SEQ2SEQ models thus capture the unidirectional dependency from source to target, i.e., p(y|x), they ignore p(x|y), the dependency from the target to the source, which has long been an important feature in phrase-based translation (Och and Ney, 2002; Shen et al., 2010). Phrase based systems that combine p(x|y), p(y|x) and other features like sentence length yield significant performance boost.\nWe propose to incorporate this bi-directional dependency and model the maximum mutual information (MMI) between source and target into SEQ2SEQ models. As Li et al. (2015) recently showed in the context of conversational response generation, the MMI based objective function is equivalent to linearly combining p(x|y) and p(y|x). With a tuning weight λ, such a loss function can be written as :\nŷ = argmax y\nlog p(x, y)\np(x)p(y)λ\n= argmax y\n(1− λ) log p(y|x) + λ log p(x|y)\n(2) But as also discussed in Li et al. (2015), direct decoding from (2) is infeasible because computing p(x|y) cannot be done until the target has been\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n00 37\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 M\nar 2\n01 6\ncomputed1. To avoid this enormous search space, we propose to use a reranking approach to approximate the mutual information between source and target in neural machine translation models. We separately trained two SEQ2SEQ models, one for p(y|x) and one for p(x|y). The p(y|x) model is used to generate N-best lists from the source sentence x. The lists are followed by a reranking process using the second term of the objective function, p(x|y).\nBecause reranking approaches are dependent on having a diverse N-best list to rerank, we also propose a diversity-promoting decoding model tailored to neural MT systems. We tested the mutual information objective function and the diversitypromoting decoding model on English→French, English→German and German→English translation tasks, using both standard LSTM settings and the more advanced attention-model based settings that have recently shown to result in higher performance.\nThe next section presents related work, followed by a background section 3 introducing LSTM/Attention machine translation models. Our proposed model will be described in detail in Sections 4, with datasets and experimental results in Section 6 followed by conclusions."

      "text" : "This paper draws on three prior lines of research: SEQ2SEQ models, modeling mutual information, and promoting translation diversity.\nSEQ2SEQ Models SEQ2SEQ models map source sequences to vector space representations, from which a target sequence is then generated. They yield good performance in a variety of NLP generation tasks including conversational response generation (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2015a; Li et al., 2015), and parsing (Vinyals et al., 2014; ?).\nA neural machine translation system uses distributed representations to model the conditional\n1As demonstrated in (Li et al., 2015)\nlog p(x, y)\np(x)p(y)λ = log p(y|x)− λ log p(y) (3)\nEqu. 2 can be immediately achieved by applying bayesian rules\nlog p(y) = log p(y|x) + log p(x)− log p(x|y)\nprobability of targets given sources, using two components, an encoder and a decoder. Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) used an encoding model akin to convolutional networks for encoding and standard hidden unit recurrent nets for decoding. Similar convolutional networks are used in (Meng et al., 2015) for encoding. Sutskever et al. (2014; Luong et al. (2015a) employed a stacking LSTM model for both encoding and decoding. Bahdanau et al. (2014), Jean et al. (2014) adopted bi-directional recurrent nets for the encoder.\nMaximum Mutual Information Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) was introduced in speech recognition (Bahl et al., 1986) as a way of measuring the mutual dependence between inputs (acoustic feature vectors) and outputs (words) and improving discriminative training (Woodland and Povey, 2002). Li et al. (2015) show that MMI could solve an important problem in SEQ2SEQ conversational response generation. Prior SEQ2SEQ models tended to generate highly generic, dull responses (e.g., I don’t know) regardless of the inputs (Sordoni et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Serban et al., 2015b). Li et al. (2015) show that modeling the mutual dependency between messages and response promotes the diversity of response outputs.\nOur goal, distinct from these previous uses of MMI, is to see whether the mutual information objective improves translation by bidirectionally modeling source-target dependencies. In that sense, our work is designed to incorporate into SEQ2SEQ models features that have proved useful in phrasebased MT, like the reverse translation probability or sentence length (Och and Ney, 2002; Shen et al., 2010; Devlin et al., 2014).\nGenerating Diverse Translations Various algorithms have been proposed for generated diverse translations in phrase-based MT, including compact representations like lattices and hypergraphs (Macherey et al., 2008; Tromble et al., 2008; Kumar and Byrne, 2004), “traits” like translation length (Devlin and Matsoukas, 2012), bagging/boosting (Xiao et al., 2013), or multiple systems (Cer et al., 2013). Gimpel et al. (2013; Batra et al. (2012), produce diverse N-best lists by adding a dissimilarity function based on N-gram overlaps, distancing the current translation from already-generated ones by choosing translations that have higher scores but distinct from previous ones. While we draw on these intuitions, these existing diversity promoting algorithms are tailored to\nphrase-based translation frameworks and not easily transplanted to neural MT decoding which requires batched computation."

      "heading" : "3.3 Unknown Word Replacements",
      "text" : "One of the major issues in neural MT models is the computational complexity of the softmax function for target word prediction, which requires summing over all tokens in the vocabulary. Neural models tend to keep a shortlist of 50,00-80,000 most frequent words and use an unknown (UNK) token to represent all infrequent tokens, which significantly impairs BLEU scores. Recent work has proposed to deal with this issue: (Luong et al., 2015b) adopt a post-processing strategy based on aligner from IBM models, while (Jean et al., 2014) approximates softmax functions by selecting a small subset of target vocabulary.\nIn this paper, we use a strategy similar to that of Jean et al. (2014), thus avoiding the reliance on external IBM model word aligner. From the attention models, we obtain word alignments from the training dataset, from which a bilingual dictionary is extracted. At test time, we first generate target sequences. Once a translation is generated, we link the generated UNK tokens back to positions in the source inputs, and replace each UNK token with the translation word of its correspondent source token using the pre-constructed dictionary.\nAs the unknown word replacement mechanism relies on automatic word alignment extraction which is not explicitly modeled in vanilla SEQ2SEQ models, it can not be immediately applied to vanilla SEQ2SEQ models. However, since unknown word replacement can be viewed as a post-processing technique, we can apply a pretrained attention-model to any given translation. For SEQ2SEQ models, we first generate translations and replace UNK tokens within the translations using the pre-trained attention models to postprocess the translations."

      "text" : "Unfortunately, the N-best lists outputted from standard beam search are a poor surrogate for the entire search space (Finkel et al., 2006; Huang, 2008). The beam search algorithm can only keep a small proportion of candidates in the search space and most of the generated translations in N-best list\n2For example, for the development set of the EnglishGerman WMT14 task, each input has an average of 2,500 candidates in the N-best list.\nare similar, differing only by punctuation or minor morphological variations, with most of the words overlapping. Because this lack of diversity in the N-best list will significantly decrease the impact of our reranking process, it is important to find a way to generate a more diverse N-best list.\nWe propose to change the way S(Y kt−1, y k,k′\nt |x) is computed in an attempt to promote diversity, as shown in Figure 1. For each of the hypotheses Y kt−1 (he and it), we generate the top K translations, yk,k ′\nt , k ′ ∈ [1,K] as in the standard beam\nsearch model. Next we rank the K translated tokens generated from the same parental hypothesis based on p(yk,k ′\nt |x, Y kt−1) in descending order: he is ranks the first among he is and he has, and he has ranks second; similarly for it is and it has.\nNext we rewrite the score for [Y kt−1, y k,k′\nt ] by adding an additional part γk′, where k′ denotes the ranking of the current hypothesis among its siblings, which is first for he is and it is, second for he has and it has.\nŜ(Y kt−1, y k,k′ t |x) = S(Y kt−1, y k,k′ t |x)− γk′ (15)\nThe top K hypothesis are selected based on Ŝ(Y kt−1, y k,k′\nt |x) as we move on to the next time step. By adding the additional term γk′, the model punishes bottom ranked hypotheses among siblings (hypotheses descended from the same parent). When we compare newly generated hypotheses descended from different ancestors, the model gives more credit to top hypotheses from each of different ancestors. For instance, even though the original score for it is is lower than he has, the model favors the former as the latter is more severely punished\nby the intra-sibling ranking part γk′. The model thus generally favors choosing hypotheses from diverse parents, leading to a more diverse N-best list.\nThe proposed model is straightforwardly implemented with minor adjustment to the standard beam search model3.\nWe employ the diversity evaluation metrics in (Li et al., 2015) to evaluate the degree of diversity of the N-best lists: calculating the average number of distinct unigrams distinct-1 and bigrams distinct2 in the N-best list given each source sentence, scaled by the total number of tokens. By employing the diversity promoting model with γ tuned from the development set based on BLEU score, the value of distinct-1 increases from 0.54% to 0.95%, and distinct-2 increases from 1.55% to 2.84% for English-German translation.
