Although I came up with them on my own, most if not all are not new and spread all over the literature.\nThe notion “general” is to be emphasized here. Unfortunately, after early unsuccessful attempts research in artificial intelligence (AI) has moved its focus on solving narrowly defined problems and tasks, which became known as “narrow AI” (Kurzweil, 2005): world level in chess, jeopardy, backgammon, self-driving cars, talking personal assistants and a myriad of other commercial applications. Although those are impressive achievements and the usefulness of such applications is beyond any doubt, a system that exhibits general intelligence seems still to be far away.\nAfter compiling a large set of definitions in the literature Legg and Hutter (2007) came up with a definition of intelligence that is consistent with most other attempts:\n“Intelligence measures an agent’s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.”\nThis is exactly, what narrow AI does not achieve: it is programmed for a very specific well-defined set of environments. Any deviation from that narrow set most probably leads to failure of the system.\nConversely, humans are usually able to solve all sorts of tasks in very diverse environments. Moreover, neuroscientific evidence teaches us, that brains are able to process data cross-modally, e.g. by transforming visual data to auditory or tactile stimuli in sensory substitution devices. It is also known that in newborn ferrets neurons in the auditory cortex adopt characteristics of visual cells, if fed with stimuli from the visual pathway (Sur et al., 1988). Those observations point to the hypothesis that the human brain is a general processor of quite diversely structured data.\nThis idea is, of course, not new and is around at least since Simon and Newell’s General Problem Solver developed in 1957. Although the problem is far from being solved practically, Hutter (2005) has developed a mathematical formulation and theoretical solution to the universal AGI problem, called AIXI. Even though AIXI is incomputable, a lot can be learned from the formulation and general thrust of research. The basic idea is the following. An AGI agent receives input data from its sensors and picks an action at every time step while trying to maximized reward. All data can be expressed as a binary sequence. In order to act successfully, sequences have to be predicted, which is achieved through Solomonoff’s universal theory of induction. Solomonoff derived an optimal way of predicting future data, given previous observations, provided the data is sampled from a computable probability distribution. In a nutshell, Hutter defines AIXI by espousing the Bellman equation of reinforcement learning to Solomonoff’s sequence prediction.\nSolomonoff (1964, 1978) has defined his famous universal prior that assigns\na prior probability (a semimeasure to be precise) to every sequence,\nM(x) ≡ ∑\np:U(p)=x\n2−|p|\nwhere the sum is over all halting programs p of length |p| for which the universal prefix Turing machine U outputs the sequence x. The universal prior exhibits an Occam bias: by far the most probability mass is captured by short explanations (programs) for an observation x. Impressively, Solomonoff has proved that this prior correctly predicts any computable sequence: M(xt|x1, . . . , xt−1) → 1 as t→∞, where xi denotes the ith sequence entry. In essence, we learn that if we are able to find short programs for arbitrary sequences the problem of universal inference is provably solved. Intuitively, the scientific method itself is about the search of simple (short) explanations of phenomena. Arguably, it is a formal and institutionalized reasoning method, but people, even infants, seem use it in more simple everyday situations (Gopnik et al., 1999). If understanding the world means to compress sensory data, we need a general data compressor.\nUnfortunately, Solomonoff induction is not computable. Therefore, Hutter and colleagues have developed approximations to AIXI, e.g. a Monte-Carlo approximation that uses prediction suffix trees that enable predicting binary D-order Markov sequences (Veness et al., 2011). This is an impressive achievement leading to a single system being able to play various games (Pac-Man, Kuhn poker, TicTacToe, biased rock-paper-scissors, 1d-maze, cheese maze, tiger and extended tiger) without having specifically been programmed for them – a notable step towards generality of AI. In spite of that, it seems questionable whether this approximation can be extended any further beyond Markov sequences, since a well-known computational problem awaits: the curse of dimensionality. We will come back to that later.\nIt may seem not intuitive that data compression plus reinforcement learning can lead to the solution of such diverse and non-trivial tasks. Traditionally, one may suspect that various cognitive processes must be involved in the solution of such tasks. Hutter shows how data compression implicitly incorporates those processes. It may be objected that simple deep search of a chess program also replaces all sorts of reasoning processes that presumably go on inside a human chess player’s brain. However, AIXI is not a short-cut narrow-AI-like solution, but provably a genuinely general approach. This has convinced me that general data compression is the way to go if we head for general intelligence."

      "text" : "Given the form of the universal prior one may consider universal search. For example, Levin search executes all possible programs, starting with the shortest,\nuntil one of them generates the required sequence. Although general, it is not surprising that it is a computationally costly approach and rarely applicable in practice.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, we have non-general but computationally tractable approaches: common AI algorithms and machine learning techniques. Why could they not be generalized? The problem that all those techniques face at some point is known as the curse of dimensionality. Considering the (algorithmic) complexity and diversity of tasks solved by typical today’s algorithms, we observe that most if not all will be highly specific and many will be able to solve quite complex tasks (Fig. 1.1). Algorithms from the field of data compression are no exception. For example, the celebrated Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm (see e.g. Cover and Thomas, 2012) handles stationary sequences but fails at compressing a simple non-stationary sequence efficiently. AI algorithms undoubtedly exhibit some intelligence, but when comparing them to humans, a striking difference comes to mind: the tasks solvable by humans seem to be much less complex albeit very diverse. After all, it is very hard for humans to perform depth search in chess 10 moves ahead or learn the transition probabilities of a variable-order stochastic Markov process, while they can do both to some extent. For example, fitting the latter is performed by Hutter’s Monte-Carlo AIXI approximation. Although Hutter has found a general, but incomputable solution to the AGI problem, in the Monte-Carlo approximation he uses again a narrow-AI-like approach. Others try to fill the task space by “gluing together” various narrow algorithms that would, hopefully, synergistically cancel each other’s combinatorial explosions (Goertzel, 2009).\nIn a nutshell, I suggest that we should not try to beat the curse of dimension-\nality mercilessly awaiting us at high complexities, but instead head for general algorithms at low complexity levels and fill the task cup from the bottom up."

      "heading" : "1.1.2 Simplicity of the algorithm",
      "text" : "Given that I have set the goal to compress general but simple data sets, the question arises whether the algorithm that performs that task can expected to be complex or rather simple as well. From the point of view of “narrow AI” the programmer has to anticipate exhaustively all data situations that his algorithm could possibly be exposed to, which would otherwise lead to bugs. Such an approach naturally leads to very complex and still not general algorithms. However, as mentioned earlier, it is the very hallmark of generality that the algorithm itself is required to be able to deal with the whole variability of data situations. Does it mean that the general AI algorithm could actually be quite simple itself?\nA biological argument points in that direction (Berglas, 2008). Human intelligence must ultimately be encoded in the DNA. The human DNA consists of only 3 billion base pairs. Since there are four bases (A, C, T and G), one base carries the information of 2 bits. Therefore, the amount of information encoded in the DNA is merely 3 · 109 · 2/8/10242 = 715 megabytes. It fits on a single Compact Disk and is much smaller than substantial pieces of non-intelligent software such as Microsoft Vista, Office, or the Oracle database.\n“Further”, Berglas writes, “only about 1.5% of the DNA actually encodes genes [although it is currently debated whether the rest is just redundant repetitive junk]. Of the gene producing portions of DNA, only a small proportion appears to have anything to do with intelligence (say 10%). The difference between Chimpanzee DNA and man is only about 1% of gene encoding regions, 5% non-gene. Much of this can be attributed to non-intelligent related issues such as the quickly changing immune system and human’s very weak sense of smell. So the difference in the “software” between humans and chimpanzees might be as little as 715 · 10% · 1.5% · 1% =11 kilobytes of real data.” Of course, we are dealing with a quite compact representation and Berglas may be wrong about one or two orders of magnitude, but hardly more. “In computer software terms even 1.0 megabytes is tiny.”\nI therefore conclude that the algorithm for general intelligence, at least as general as human intelligence, must be simple compared to modern software. We are facing a software problem, not a memory problem."

      "heading" : "1.2 A measure for partial progress in AGI",
      "text" : "One of the troubles of AGI research is the lack of a measure for partial progress. While the Turing test is widely accepted as a test for general intelligence, it is only able to give an all or none signal. In spite of all attempts, we did not yet have a way to tell whether we are half way or 10% through towards general intelligence.\nThe reason for that disorientation is the fact that every algorithm that achieved part of what we may call intelligent behavior, has failed to generalize to a wider range of behaviors. Therefore, we could not tell whether we have made some progress in the right direction or whether we have been on the wrong track all along. As Dreyfus (1992) cynically remarks, progress in AI is like the man who tries to get to the moon by climbing a tree: “one can report steady progress, all the way to the top of the tree”. Since dead ends have been ubiquitous there has been growing skepticism in the AI community.\nHowever, since Hutter (2005) has mathematically solved the AGI problem (!), and the core part to be made tractable is the compression part, we can formalize partial progress toward AGI as the extent to which general compression has been achieved.\nAs I argued in ch. 1.1, if we start out with a provably general algorithm that works up to a complexity level, thereby solving all simple compression problems, the objection about its possible non-generalizability is countered. The measure for partial progress then simply becomes the complexity level up to which the algorithm can solve all problems. Here, I will try to formalize that measure.\nSuppose, we run binary programs on a universal prefix Turing machine U . U ’s possible input programs pi can be ordered in a length-increasing lexicographic way: “” (empty program), “0”, “1”, “00”, “01”, “10”, “11”, “000”, etc. up to a maximal complexity level L. We run all those programs until they halt or for a maximum of t time steps and read off their outputs xi on the output tape. In contrast to Kolmogorov complexity1, we use the time-bounded version – the Levin complexity – which is computable and includes a penalty term on computation time (Li and Vitányi, 2009):\nKt(x) = min p {|p|+ log t : U(p) = x in t steps}\nSaving all the generated strings paired with their optimal programs (xi, poi ) with poi = {p : Kt(xi) = |p| + log t, |p| ≤ L}, we have all we need for the progress measure. The goal of the general compressor is to find all such optimal programs poi for each of the xi. If p is the actual program found by the compressor, its performance can be measured by\nri(L) = |xi| − |p| |xi| − |poi | ∈ [0, 1]\nif the current string x is among the {xi}. If not, there is no time-bounded solution to the compression problem. The overall performance R at complexity level L could be used as a measure for partial progress in general compression and be given by averaging: R(L) = 〈ri(L)〉. For example, one could start with a small L until R approaches 1 and increase L gradually as suggested by Fig. 1.1.\nOne may object that the number of programs increases exponentially with their length such that an enumeration quickly becomes intractable. This is\n1The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is defined as the length of the shortest program able to generate that string on a Turing machine.\na weighty argument if the task is universal search – a general procedure for inversion problems. However, I suggest this procedure to play the mere role of a test case for an efficient general compression algorithm, which will use completely different methods than universal search and the properties of which shall be outlined in ch. 2. Therefore, using the set of simple programs as a test case may be enough to set the general compression algorithm on the right track. If the limit complexity of what is tractable today is Ltoday, then I doubt that there exists an algorithm that is able to compress all sequences x that can be generated by a program p with |p| ≤ Ltoday. It will be a matter of future tests to find out."

      "text" : "It is well known in the theory of Kolmogorov complexity that most strings cannot be compressed; more precisely, only exponentially few O(2n−m) binary strings of length n can be compressed by m bits (see e.g. Sipser, 2012). Interestingly, the number of predictable sequences are also tightly bounded by an expression of the same order of magnitude Θ(2n−m) (Kalnishkan et al., 2003). This proven fact strengthens the intuition that understanding and therefore predicting the world is about compressing sensory data.\nSince we can not compress most sequences, it suffices to find programs for that small fraction of compressible sequences. Further, we have to be aware that an optimal algorithm that compresses all compressible sequences may not exist. After all, it is not clear whether all information needed to infer the shortest program is present in the sequence itself or whether additional knowledge is required. For example, the first few digits of π (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, . . .) may not contain enough information to infer π, they rather follow only after the discovery of additional knowledge about trigonometric functions and their properties.\nIn summary, we are heading for an algorithm that infers short programs generating most compressible sequences. The algorithm should be general from the start, i.e. be able to find most if not all sequences below a complexity threshold."

The former leads to efficient inference but breaks down if the data is not in the appropriate format. The latter is widely applicable but the struggle is with low convergence rates, local minima or overfitting. In both cases careful tuning is required by\nthe programmer. Christoph von der Malsburg2 diagnosed this situation quite cynically by saying that most of the final algorithm’s intelligence resides not in the algorithm itself but in the programmer’s intelligent tuning."

      "text" : "The first 4 digits may indicate that the sequence alternates between 1 and 3. This hypothesis is then expanded as a new alternation is discovered subsequently between 2 and 4. This may lead to the hypothesis that we are dealing with blocks of alternation subsequences. The next block alternates 3 and 5 and we discover that each block is longer by 1 element than the previous block, while the starting number is also increasing from 1 to 2 to 3 and so on, while the difference between alternating numbers is always 2. This hypothesis is changed again when 1 and 4 start to alternate, hence it looks like the starting number and block length has been reset and the difference is increased to 3.\nIn fact a quite simple program can be written to generate that sequence. But how could it be inferred? Humans obviously can do this. We notice that the inductive bias and the corresponding search space is increasingly expanded in directions dictated by the data itself. First, alternation can be parametrized by two numbers – a small search space quickly instantiated with 1 and 3. Then it is expanded to represent blocks of subsequences containing alternating sequences. Then, not two numbers are saved, but the starting one and the difference (equal to 2 then to 3) are saved. And finally the simplest parametrized representation that contains the present sequence is found: blocks of alternating sequences of variable differences and block lengths.\nConventionally, one would either preprogram this parametrization and learning would simply consist of finding the parameters. Or one would define a large search space of programs containing the correct one and end up being lost in the search space. In contrast to that, I suggest starting with a small search space and expand it in directions imposed by the actual data.\nOf course, I am not the only one who thought about this problem. An interesting piece of work comes from the Bayes community. Kemp and Tenenbaum (2008) present an algorithm using hierarchical Bayesian inference in order to “discover structural form”, e.g. given feature vectors of animal properties inferring that they should be arranged on a (evolutionary) tree rather than on a chain, circle or grid. The interesting property is that learning is reasonably fast given a quite large search space. After all, the structural forms are not given a priori. Thus, an interplay between several Bayesian hierarchies happens. First, a piece of data comes in and produces a slight bias towards one of the struc-\n2Personal communication\ntures. Then, this slight inductive bias toward some of the structures is used to categorize new data more efficiently, which leads to an even faster formation of bias toward a structure. Hence, we see here a nice example of a flexible inductive bias. The downside is though that the overall large space of structures has to be defined, in this case by a graph grammar generating the structures. Consequently, the whole big search space is still given a priori, learning is mere selection of one of the hypotheses in the large space; just inference is made in clever way. In contrast to that, I suggest to refrain from defining the search space of the algorithm before data arrives.\nActually, this insight should be obvious. After all, the scientific method does not prespecify all possible theories that could explain all possible worlds before starting to observe the world experimentally. Instead, when new data comes in, scientists try to find a set of simple explanations consistent with it and all previous data. In computer science terms, a large search space is traversed efficiently by ruling out large subspaces inconsistent with data. Solutions of considerable complexity can be found that way, just think of modern theories in physics.\nOur line of reasoning suggests to the following iterative approach.\n1. Look at a sufficiently small piece of data.\n2. Construct a set of as simple as possible hypotheses consistent with it – a small search space.\n3. Look at the next piece of data and compute the likelihoods and posteriors of the hypotheses.\n4. Expand the search space around the most likely hypotheses, e.g. find generalizations or supersets of the most likely hypotheses. Discard the unlikely ones.\n5. Go to 3 until the posterior probability of a hypothesis is large enough."

      "text" : "The crucial question becomes how to construct the set of simplest hypotheses consistent with the sequence part seen so far. If we solve this problem for arbitrary sequences, I suspect that the most difficult task for a general data compressor will be solved.\nFor example, consider a sequence, starting with 1, 3, . . . Suppose one considers the null hypothesis that it is a deterministic first-order Markov sequence using addition. Then, the only unknown is the summand which can be fitted to be 2 – a small search space –, and the sequence can be continued to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, . . . There are several ways the null hypothesis can be expanded: it can be questioned in three possible ways. The sequence could be\n• indeterministic,\n• higher-order Markov or non-Markovian at all, or\n• using a different arithmetic function or an arbitrary function,\nor a combination of any of them. It seems to be a general observation that the definition of a hypothesis consists of features (here determinism, Markovianity and the applied function) that can be questioned systematically and from which new hypotheses can be derived. The null hypothesis is a specification of the search space, the inductive bias, within which a search algorithm has to find a solution. The “narrow AI” approach is marked by the fact that such specifications are provided by a human programmer after a careful prior examination of the data set. Only the remaining “blind” search is performed by the algorithm, which is then proudly announced to be “intelligent” (McDermott, 1976). If we want to depart from such practices, we have to find an algorithmic way to question those specifications and corresponding underlying assumptions.\nFor example, a higher order Markov process can be described by taking data from n previous entries implying position offsets described by the family of sets {−1,−2, . . . ,−n} parametrized by n. Searching for a solution in this subspace is what I call expanding the hypothesis in the direction of the feature. Expanding in the direction of Markovianity thus leads to a sequence of possible alternative hypotheses, ordered after complexity: 2nd, 3rd,... , n-th order Markov processes. This ordered set of alternative hypotheses in the direction of a particular feature is what I call hypothesis sequence.\nOverall, it seems that features act as a “basis” and elements of a hypothesis sequence act like “coordinates”. Specifying the value of each feature leads to a sufficient specification of the problem for a search algorithm to solve it. The metaphor of a feature basis will prove useful, as we will see later, and hopefully could move beyond a metaphor and acquire a precise mathematical meaning at some point."

Assuming it to be defined on the domain {0, 1} and each entry drawn from it with probability p = 0.5, then its entropy is H0 = −16 log2(p) = 16 bits. It takes 16 bits of memory to store it. Suppose, we have inferred a parametric program that represents “start at position n and write l ones, all others are zero”. As n and l can range between 1 and 16, each of them requires Hpars = log2 16 = 4 bits to be specified. Additionally the program itself requires memory Hprog.

Neglecting the size of the program it corresponds to a considerable compression rate of 1−200/1024 = 80.4%. But suppose we discover a regularity in the starting positions and lengths, say ni = 100 · i and li = 4. Then only one length has to be specified and the step size (100), which takes only H(2)pars = 20 bits and pushes the overall compression rate to 1 − 20/1024 = 98%. In this fashion, data can be compressed recursively in the sense that the same data compression machinery is first applied to the data itself and then recursively to the parameters of the models. Here we notice the need for the generality of the data compressor: after all, we had a single binary sequence at first and then two integer sequences for the starting positions and lengths, respectively. A recursion level should be accepted if compression is increased. Recursive data compression can reach arbitrary high levels until no more compressive model is found. A great example in science is the quest for unification in physics: the standard model of particle physics is left with only 19 parameters to be explained in a grand unified theory. In contrast to this, AI algorithms usually do not possess additional compression levels, except in the small field of metacognition research (Cox, 2005). But even there compression is not recursive, i.e. different algorithms are used at meta-levels, except some notable examples from Marvin Minsky’s group (Singh, 2005; Morgan, 2013). If we want to build a general compressor though, there is no way we can foresee which type of algorithm is needed for which data set and at which level: the compressor has to be general enough to handle them all."

      "text" : "In ch. 2.2 we gave an example of three features. Those features are orthogonal in the sense that the specification of each of them does not contain information about any of the others. Markovianity does not bear on determinism of the applied function, nor does (in)determinism specify dependence structures or the applied function etc. Formally, the pairwise mutual information between all features should be zero. We should aim to find an orthogonal feature basis for the description of a data set since otherwise features share information and lead to redundancy in the representations, which implies a lower total compression rate. Orthogonality also specifies the search procedure. Suppose we have answered the question about the dependence structure and found out that the current sequence entry only depends on the previous one. Then all remaining questions boil down to describing that dependence and can be tackled independently. In other words, only orthogonal features need to be considered.\nIn summary, our compression algorithm can be characterized as follows. First, it has to find an orthogonal feature basis and expand in the direction of those features. Then the likelihood of each hypothesis in the space spanned by the feature basis can be computed. Then the hypothesis with the largest\nposterior probability can be expanded further etc. while we look at more and more data. We should use the posterior instead of the likelihood since the Bayes theorem automatically takes care of Occam’s razor – the trade off between explanatory power of a model and its complexity (see chapter “Model comparison and Occam’s Razor” in MacKay, 2003). In parallel, since the feature basis is parametrized, the residual entropy in the parameters should be compressed further in higher recursion levels leading to increasingly simpler and powerful models."

In Principal Component Analysis (PCA) at each step a vector is first defined pointing to the direction of largest variance and then the data cloud is projected onto the surface perpendicular to that vector such that the variance in its direction is nullified. Subsequently, only the residual variance in perpendicular directions is considered such that ultimately an orthogonal basis is found ordered after the variance “explained” by the vectors. Analogously, orthogonal features can be extracted when focusing on the residual variance of the data. For example, consider a point B lying exactly in the middle between two other points, A and C. Suppose the features “distance” and “angle” are available to the system. First, the system would notice that the distances A-B and B-C are equal and thereby discover the equidistancy feature, since two equal distances leads to compression (see ch. 4.1). This feature may be viewed as the first “principal component”. Then, images can be sampled holding the equidistancy feature active, which results in random isosceles triangles. Subsequently, the residual variance is found in the angle feature which is 180° (or π) – again a compressible number – in the case of B lying in the middle between A and C. This leads to the discovery of the “between” feature. In this way, the situation “B is in the middle between A and C” can be described in a complete and orthogonal feature basis: middle = equidistant and between. The basis is orthogonal, because angles and distances can be changed independently of each other. It is complete, because constraining a point to be in equal distance to two other points while lying at the same time between them, necessarily produces instances of the “middle” situation.\nEven though the requirement of an orthogonal and complete basis and a PCA-like procedure for its search greatly reduces the search space for features, it is not clear enough to me how to find features in arbitrary data situations and constitutes one of the frontiers for future research. A crucial, feature defining step seems to be the ability to realize that the current data situation is a special case of a general one. After all, as I argued in ch. 2.1, the general description must not (and can not) be given a priori."

      "text" : "Someone said that the idea of splitting the AI field in a multitude of subfields has marked the beginning of the failure of the whole field. After all, perception requires reasoning, reasoning requires learning, learning has to rely on planning an vice versa – all subfields are actually densely interconnected in the human mind. Hence, the attempt to solve them separately from the others may have slowed down the progress in general AI.\nFor example, image segmentation in computer vision suffers from the problem that our ability to segment an image into separate objects and their parts heavily depends on our knowledge about the objects. As I will argue in ch. 4.1, the conceptualization of objects is driven by compression. Therefore, an image or sequence, should be segmented in such a way that compression is maximized. I suggest that a sequence should be segmented in those cases when all segments are highly compressible while the whole sequence can not be easily compressed. For example, piecewise constant sequences: 15, 15, 15, 15, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 32, 7, 7, 7, 7. Implicitly, it was assumed here, that the segmentation consists in finding a partition of the position set {1, . . . , 14} into intervals, and not an arbitrary partition. This bias can again be explained by the recursiveness of general compression: intervals can be described simply by two numbers while the description of a generic subset would have to enumerate all positions that it consists of.\nIn essence, the problem consists of finding an assignment of every data point to a subset of the partition. Like in multistable perception images where the same image can be interpreted in several ways, one can frame the problem as a rivalry for different interpretations of the same image, while trying to maximize compression. The problem is reminiscent of the famous Ising model in which the spins of a hot ferromagnet are first oriented randomly, but increasingly form islands of equally oriented spins as the temperature decreases. This behavior is explained by a high energy that is required to keep neighboring spins in opposite directions. Similarly, a perceptual scene should naturally break up into segments/objects when trying to maximize compression."

What then? One of the most burning questions in AI is the problem that AI systems do not really know anything about the world, commonsense knowledge possessed by any 3-year-old. As Marvin Minksy has put it, “no program today can look around a room and then\nidentify the things that meet its eyes” (Minsky, 2011). The problem is not just about identification but about being able to understand and describe the objects and knowing about their function.\nIn this section, I will argue why grounded reasoning is an important step towards commonsense reasoning an thereby towards AGI and how it densely and naturally interacts with general compression."

      "heading" : "3.1 What is grounding?",
      "text" : "In his seminal paper, Harnad (1990) addresses the so-called symbol grounding problem – a symptom of a disease of purely symbolic AI systems:\n“How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols?”\nI suggest to split the problem into two subproblems. The first is a philosophical problem called intentionality: how can symbols or any representations for that matter re-present anything about the world? Where is the invisible arrow pointing from the symbol DOG to the real dog? And how can the symbol DOG ever express the ineffable meaning of a real dog? Based on such questions, there is a huge philosophical discussion about whether computers could ever think (see e.g. Dreyfus, 1992); after all, computers only juggle the symbols “0” and “1” around, without ever being able to know what anything truly means. I shall not dive into this discussion, but merely state that representations are not meant to possess any intentionality, there is no arrow, but merely a mechanical reaction to external stimuli. The “grandmother neuron” simply reacts to the occurrence of the grandmother in the visual field, it does not point to the grandmother in any way, nor does it “know” about the grandmother in any deeper epistemological sense.\nThe second subproblem is more important though. I define a system as grounded if it is able to form representations at arbitrary granularity. Imagine several feature bases of a square (Fig. 3.1). It is easy to see, that four features are enough to specify the square, that is to form a complete, orthogonal basis for it. But the basis is not unique, Fig. 3.1a is just as good as 3.1b. Further, a basis can be formed from line segments as in Figs. 3.1c and 3.1d. However, it is the hallmark of features to represent an aspect of the stimulus while dismissing other information. Once the line feature is represented, it can only be changed by its parameters (end point coordinates), but not cut into pieces as in 3.1d. One the feature base in 3.1a is chosen, changing α leads to a rotation around the corner, but not, say, around the mid point of the square. The point is, once a feature basis of an object is chosen, the representation becomes atomic, such that the ability to form more fine-grained representations is lost. The only way to split the atoms is to go back to the low level input, either to the actual square stimulating the systems sensors or to generate an imagined square from the complete feature basis. Only then a new, more fine-grained feature basis can\nbe extracted, since only the low level input stimulus, presented to the system point by point, contains enough information to accomplish that task.\nIt may be interjected that it is exactly those variably fine-grained representations that hierarchical network approaches such as DeSTIN (Arel et al., 2009) or Hawkins’ Hierarchical Temporal Memories (Hawkins and Blakeslee, 2007) develop at each of their levels. However, I see at least three problems associated with them. First, nodes at each level look at a specific, hard-wired patch of child nodes at the level below. Thus, a hierarchical segmentation of the image is essentially hard-wired and fails to fulfill the requirement of a data-dependent inductive bias (ch. 2.1). Second, such hierarchies are designed for finding partonomic stimulus decompositions, while failing to find other representations (e.g. taxonomies). Finally, the representations can not be transformed, thus inhibiting resourceful thinking. The latter point is so important that the next subsection will be devoted to it. Nevertheless, hierarchical representations may well be the right solution, but their flexibility has to increase significantly, probably to obtain the same expressive power as the hierarchies of program trees in general.\nConsider further the procedure in ch. 2.6. Assume a function that establishes whether a point is in the middle between two others has been hardcoded, making it impossible for the system to analyze it further. However, remarkably, this PCA-like procedure allows for the decomposition of a seemingly atomic/symbolic concept “middle” into its components “equidistant” and “between”. A grounded system is able to dissolve a concept such as a “grandmother” into its conceptual components (e.g. body parts), the components recursively into their own components etc. down to the raw input image. It is thus the interaction between the concept and the low level input that allows for an analysis of variable granularity.\nAs we shall see, grounding will set the foundation for non-symbolic, context dependent reasoning and resourceful thinking."

      "heading" : "3.2 Resourcefulness",
      "text" : "Intelligent problem solving requires the ability to think in different ways about the problem, which Minsky coined as resourcefulness (Minsky, 2006). The research in the phenomenon of “insight” in thought psychology constitutes a well presentation of this issue. For example, in Karl Duncker’s famous “candle problem” the subject is asked to fix a lit candle on a wall (a cork board) in a way so the candle wax won’t drip onto the table below. To do so, the subject is provided a book of matches and a box of thumbtacks. Usually, subjects have difficulties to solve the problem until it dawns on them that the box containing the thumbtacks, can be tacked to the wall and serve as holder of the candle. Hence, humans have got the ability to think of a box sometimes as a container and sometimes as a supporting device.\nIn the so-called mutilated chessboard problem (Kaplan and Simon, 1990), the two diagonally opposing corners of the 8 x 8 board are cut out. The subject is required to either cover this mutilated chessboard with domino pieces, each covering two squares, such that all 62 squares are fully covered, or to prove that\nthe task is insoluble. Usually, after trying various coverings subjects experience an “aha” moment realizing that the two missing corners are of the same color, say white. Therefore, there are two more black squares than white squares. Since each domino piece covers one black and one white square, there will always be two black squares left after each covering of the board. And since two black squares are never adjacent on a chessboard, the task is insoluble.\nThe reason for the present discussion is that in such cases subjects need to switch to a different “representation space” (Kaplan and Simon, 1990) of the problem – a different feature basis in our terminology – in order to solve it. First, the search space is spanned by the combinations of positions of domino pieces. Only after attending to the color feature of the chessboard and spanning the search space by the colors and numbers of squares, the problem can be solved efficiently. Only after switching from the containing to the supporting feature of the thumbtack box, the solution of the candle problem comes to mind.\nAs it was discussed in ch. 3.1, a square can be represented in different ways. A intelligent system has to be able to both understand that fact and to switch between various representations in order to be resourceful.\nResourcefulness poses by itself a strong argument against “narrow AI”: if the representation of the problem is chosen a priori there is no way the system could change it. Whether the representation is symbolic or subsymbolic in nature, it intrinsically introduces a fixed induction bias to the system. As I have argued in ch. 2.1, in spite of being important and necessary the induction bias must be changeable in a flexible way.\nThis realization begs the question whether it is possible to find an algorithm for the transformation between features bases. Is there a general way to detect appropriate transformations, rotations in search space, so to speak? What con-\nnects two representations of the same data? Can such changes in representation can generally be achieved without going back to the input itself?\nI suspect that the answer is negative; after all only the low level input contains all the information necessary to construct arbitrary representations. A plausible way to switch representations is to take the current one, generate a data sample from it (simulate it on the “mental stage”) and look for a different feature basis to represent it again. For example, one should take a definition (a generative model) of a square, sample a particular square from it, observe some other features of it and span a different feature basis, which constitutes a different definition of the same figure. Without the input, there is no way to “cut through” the existing symbols; neither transformations into different feature bases seem possible without a severe task-specific formalization effort, nor are representations of variable granularity possible.\nTherefore, resourceful thinking is only possible if any construction of the system’s symbols must be performed via the input. Otherwise, it is either not possible to transform representations or – as it happens in formal logic – transformations decouple the symbols from the world/input, leaving them ungrounded, “dangling in the air” and independent of context.\nIn a nutshell, not only should the search for the right hypothesis describing the data depend on the data itself, but also the resourcefulness of thinking – the ability to represent the data in different ways – should be tightly tied to the data itself. As such, resourcefulness constitutes another argument for grounding."

      "text" : "The AI community has been aware of the commonsense problem for quite a while, but tackled it with limited success, unfortunately (Mueller, 2010). I suggest that the main reason for it is the lack of grounding of representations.\nThe grounding of representations has been neglected for quite a while although there have been calls for it (Harnad, 1990; Barsalou, 1999). Originally, the call was for grounding of symbols, since it is with symbols that reasoning has been represented, through usage of formal logic mostly.\nConsider a commonsense problem, such using a string to tie a plant to a rod, that is stuck into the ground. The prevalent method in the commonsense reasoning community is to formalize the problem, such that all sorts of valid statements can be logically concluded from the formal logical system. The idea is to hand code abstracted relations between entities of the situation, add some arguably general properties of space and time, and then being able to express all other relationships in the situation basically through combinations of those abstractions, e.g. by forward chaining through the formal knowledge base.\nThere are several problems with such an approach. First, in practice, commonsense situations are very difficult to formalize and arguably the formalization process has to be done for each situation separately unless one has formalized the whole world somehow. Of course, this is exactly the ambition of projects like Cyc which try to do that since 1985 (Lenat, 1995). Difficulty is\nnot a formal argument of course, but we have to ask ourselves whether we are on the right path with such an approach.\nSecond, being ungrounded means having to carry the structure of a real world situation into one’s system which bears a practical danger that the hand coded or concluded relations between entities will not hold as the system is scaled up (Bach, 2009). There is no guarantee that the encoded relations are actually the correct abstractions from the world situations.\nThird, ungrounded representations have difficulties reacting to new situations where a new context leads to different conclusions.\nTherefore, I suggest a simulation theory approach, much along the lines of Barsalou (1999), that keeps a tight connection to the world while being able to reason about it, as I will argue in the subsequent chapters."

      "text" : "Up to now, we have mostly talked about representations and how to switch between them, but not how to reason about properties and relations in a grounded way.\nConsider dropping a perpendicular from a corner of an isosceles triangle onto the base. Then we will land exactly in the middle of the base. That sort of task is quite easy to formalize and a formal proof that this is true for all isosceles triangles can be derived. On the other hand, consider the approach of a grounded mental simulation, which is arguably the way, humans solve the task (Barsalou, 1999). From a representation of an isosceles triangle a particular sample triangle is drawn onto the mental stage. Then, the perpendicular is dropped that happens to land in the middle of the basis, a fact that can be read off from the mental stage using appropriate features. The main difference between the ungrounded and the grounded approach is that the former tries to arrive at conclusions through proofs, that is by transforming one’s own representations, while the latter samples a particular situation top-down onto the mental stage, imposes the appropriate conditions and then reads off the result though bottom up activation of features. This is the kind of grounded reasoning employed by simulation theories.\nNote that this sampling procedure implicitly computes a sort of modus ponens as in propositional logic. Given an isosceles triangle, it follows that the perpendicular onto the base will split it in half. Interestingly, only the premise – the presentation of a particular isosceles triangle in the simulation space/mental stage – is provided by the system. The implication clause itself is not represented anywhere in the system and still the conclusion can be measured from the mental stage. However, the implication clause is necessary for modus ponens to work. Where is it then?\nIt must be in the world itself then. I suspect that it is the structure of the world that implicitly “represents” by far the most knowledge. Either by perceiving the world, or by connecting with it by mental simulation, it seems possible to get access to that knowledge. In essence, it is not by hand coding\nor self-organized learning of large knowledge bases, but by letting the world itself “represent” the large part of our knowledge, the commonsense knowledge problem could be solved. Although this claim parallels Dreyfus’ (1992) call for Heideggerian AI, I do not share his rejection of representations per se: we do need representations in our systems, but they shall be grounded in the world and the world’s intrinsic structure should be used for reasoning. Also, it is not the magic touch of reality that is sometimes suspected behind the successes of today’s fashionable “embedded, embodied cognition”, but a call for a tight connection between one’s representations and the world. It is the informational richness of an actual image – be it real, virtual or imagined – that performs that intrinsic reasoning task.\nWithout going into details, other elements of logical reasoning, conjunctions, disjunctions, resolution etc. can be performed by simulation theories (Uchida et al., 2012).\nIt may be objected that it may be difficult to construct grounded knowledge of abstract concepts, while they are seemingly easy to construct in formal logic, e.g. loves(father, son). However, one shall not be fooled by the meaning that those symbols convey to us, since they do not ground the machine but just remind us of our own groundedness. I suspect that symbols tend to merely seduce the researcher to look for shortcuts around the grounding problem. Conversely, even though simulation theories seem only to be describing reasoning with visualizable, commonsense objects, one shall not underestimate the power of analogical reasoning in the formation abstract concepts. After all, the whole tradition of empiricist philosophy argues that the acquisition of abstract concepts may ultimately be grounded in perception."

After checking truth values of statements for some particular simulated samples, how can it be inferred that the same truth value will be observed for all samples under the present conditions?\nConsider a probabilistic account: what are the chances of picking a random isosceles triangle such that the base happens to be cut exactly in the middle by the perpendicular? Not high, and the probability will decrease even more when measuring the cutting point with higher precision. Of course, this is not a strict proof, but as has been argued many times, human intelligence does not have to be perfect, but just good enough for correctly dealing with most situations in life.\nIf the system maintains hypotheses about the triangle in the background of reasoning, it can evaluate the likelihood that a particular unpredicted curiosity of the sample could have been generated by chance. Of course, one would have to specify what such a curiosity is and how it is to be identified. After all, why is cutting the basis at length fraction of 0.5 (in the middle) so much more suspicious and curiosity awakening than cutting it at 0.46878?\nHere is where compression plays a central role. Choosing a binary representation, the number 5 can be expressed by 101, whereas 46878 will be much longer (1011011100011110). In terms of Kolmogorov complexity, the shortest program with 0.5 as output will be much shorter than the shortest writing 0.46878.\nKeep in mind that all that was used by the simulation was just the definition of an isosceles triangle. Without proof, the fact that the base was met in the middle is surprising since the cutting point is at a position of low complexity. The surprise comes from the fact that a line piece can only have very few such points of low complexity (low fractions as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 or some other salient numbers such as 1/π) and hence the probability of hitting those points is very low unless entailed by the definition of the problem in the first place.\nConsider another example. Imagine a “whip”: one end of a string is tied to an end of a rod. In what case the other end of the string could reach the other end of the rod? Commonsense dictates that the string be at least as long as the rod. How did we arrive at that hypothesis? Suppose, after a trial and error phase, the system figures out that the length l of the string is important. What condition should be imposed on it? The system could invent an array of numbers l1, l2, l3, . . . and construct an arbitrary complex condition from it, such as l ≤ l1 ∧ l > l2 ∧ l ≤ (l3 − l2)2/l1. However, the Occam bias dictates parsimonious solutions. Since the length of the rod lr is already present in the data and does not have to be invented, it is to be used preferably and in a simple way. One of the simplest ways that is consistent with previous trial and error data is therefore l ≥ lr. This hypothesis can be quickly tested by choosing l = lr ± with a small , which will drive its posterior probability close to 1. Just as in sequence prediction, the reuse of already present variables such as previous entries or the rod length, and doing it in a simple way maximizes the chances of finding correct hypotheses.\nNote that a hypothesis could be found for all isosceles triangles and for all strings complying with the conditions, which establishes that simple hypotheses are viable candidates for valid universally quantified statements. Nevertheless, how much certainty can be gained that the statement is really universally true and not just for the few examples?\nGetting a few examples fully consistent with the simplest explanation is so compelling in terms of posterior probability that we arrive close to certainty, because a simple explanation is so much more probable a priori than a complex one. However, exceptions can always occur. For example, two natural numbers a and b picked uniformly from 1 to 1000 will be different with probability 99.9%. For some reason, the exception, a = b is exactly the compressible case, since then only one number has to be stored. I therefore suspect that exceptions occur preferably at compressible instantiations of the variables, which considerably simplifies their detection. Otherwise, if Nature wants to introduce exceptions at incompressible locations, she has to pay for it with information. After all, since exceptions are nothing but missing truth conditions of a statement, they are thus biased towards simplicity as any truth condition.\nWe conclude that general compression with its hypothesis sequences ordered from low to high complexity has the potential to solve the universal quantifica-\ntion problem in simulation theories, bringing us much closer to the solution of the commonsense problem."

      "heading" : "3.6 Testing hypotheses, intervention",
      "text" : "Given a set of possible hypotheses, the important question about hypothesis testing arises. As can be shown, structure learning in Bayesian networks proceeds much faster, if it is possible to intervene and observe the effects of the intervention (Pearl, 1988). Essentially, the question is about setting up scientific experiments. Which actions shall be chosen in order to gain most information about the data given current hypotheses?\nThe solution is known as the principle of maximum entropy (MacKay, 2003). Given a set of hypotheses and their prior probabilities coming from both previous data and the Occam bias, the probability of every result of an experiment can be computed. The maximum entropy principle states that the action should be chosen in such a way that the entropy of the probability distribution of the possible results is maximal. In other words the all results should be expected to be seen with the same probability given current hypotheses.\nFor example, in the previous chapter, the goal was to test whether the other end of the rod of length lr is reachable by a string of length l. We assume that the possibility of reaching that end is described by l ≥ l0, and some lengths l have already been tested reducing the possible range of l0to a ≤ l0 ≤ b. The result of the task shall be given by the variable X, with X = 1 meaning that the task is possible. Suppose, there are two hypotheses, H1 : l0 = lr and H2 : l0 is uniform. If H1 is true, then any string longer than the rod will lead to success, hence the likelihood of l is p(X = 1|l,H1) = Θ(l−lr), with Θ being the Heaviside step function. If H2 is true, then the probability of success increases linearly between a and b, p(X = 1|l,H2) = l−ab−a . Marginalizing out the hypotheses, we get\np(X = 1|l) = p(X = 1|l,H1)p(H1) + p(X = 1|l,H2)p(H2) =\nΘ(l − lr)β + l − a b− a (1− β) = 1 2\nwith β = p(H1) = 1 − p(H2) representing the bias, hence incorporating the posterior probabilities on the hypotheses derived so far. Setting the probability to 12 is the maximum entropy requirement, since only two results are possible. Solving this equation for l leads to the optimal length for the test. Since the hypotheses can been derived by the general compressor, the bias for the more simple hypothesis H1 will be strong, β . 1, since the rod length lr is a variable already present in the representation and no new length l0 has to be introduced. Therefore, the discontinuity will jump over 12 and the optimal test is going directly for the simple hypotheses: l = lr with some small around it.\nIn summary, we see that optimal hypothesis tests can be computed by the maximum entropy principle. Of course, there is no need for mathematical derivation of the necessary distributions in practice, as we did here. Instead,\nthe distributions can be bootstrapped, given our generative hypotheses, leading to approximately optimal tests."

Further, a good idea is to assume that all points are white with only few exceptions that constitute the line drawing. Therefore, it is enough to store that all are white and the positions of the black points. Each point requires the specification of two coordinates, taking 2 log2 n bits. If the number of black points is m n2 then the entropy reduces to 1 + 2m log2 n n2 bits (one bit to specify the background color). One may call this compression and representation step as the discovery of the concept POINT. Further, if the drawing consists of straight lines, the system should discover that as well, meaning that the coordinates of some points can be computed from others given the slope of the line. Essentially, the number of line end points l is much smaller than the overall number of black points, which reduces the entropy further to 1 + 2l log2 n 1 + 2m log2 n. This may be called as the discovery of the LINE concept. Consider, for example a “house” drawn as a triangle on top of a square (Fig. 4.1a). It requires only 6 lines to be specified, hence l = 12. Assume n = 128 then, we get an entropy H = 1 + 2l log2 n = 169 bits, which is quite small compared to a random bit image with H = n2 = 16384 bits. Further, the system could discover that those lines are connected, i.e. the line ends of some lines constitute the same points, which make a loop. Hence, the drawing can be put together by two closed POLYGONS. Subsequently, the system may discover that the number of points between the corners of one of polygons is equal, which gives birth to the rough concept of LENGTH and SQUARE. The number of corners then define the concepts TETRAGON and TRIANGLE.\nThere are several lessons to learn from this procedure. First, the guiding principle for concept generation is compression. For example, there is a cascade of subsets: squares ⊂ rhombs, rectangles ⊂ parallelograms ⊂ trapezoids\n⊂ tetragons ⊂ polygons ⊂ chains of lines ⊂ set of lines ⊂ binary image. As we have seen, every such step from general to specific constitutes not just a special case, but a compressible special case. A square is not just some specific rectangle, but a compressible one in the sense that all sides are equal and therefore less numbers are needed to define it.\nSecond, each specification step is reached by imposing a constraint on the previous one. After all, because of the recursivity of the compression algorithm, every compression step merely compresses the remaining degrees of freedom of the previous compression step.\nThird, ambiguities are resolved by compressibility. After all, there is no unique partition of the “house” into polygons. Nevertheless, since a square or even rectangle is a quite special polygon the scene is preferably partitioned into the square and the remaining isosceles triangle (see ch. 2.7 on interpretation rivalry).\nFinally, concept learning is driven not just by compression, but also by the stimuli that occur preferably in the world. After all, from the point of view of compressibility one could attach the “roof” just as well on the side of the building instead of its top. Hence, the world biases concept learning towards actually occurring cases. This becomes especially important when the number of possible objects increases exponentially with the number of elements that an object consists of.\nBeyond the representation of objects, spatial relations can also be derived. For example, the concept of a DISTANCE between objects could be conceptualized as the length of an imagined line between them. Further, the concepts ABOVE, BELOW, LEFT, RIGHT are low complexity conditions on the x- and y-coordinates.\nOf course, this brief discussion does not demonstrate the viability of the approach, nor does it show that all concepts can be derived this way, including abstract ones. However, it highlights the important role, compression might play in the generation of concepts about the world."

This begs the question about permanent knowledge storage in a way consistent with the present ideas.\nA tentative and admittedly incomplete idea is to store knowledge about objects in the form of typical templates. A template is an image of an object that is fully stored in the system memory. Storing complete images is necessary for grounded reasoning since the system has to preserve the ability to reason about imagined objects at arbitrary granularity. After all, for sufficiently complex objects such as a Mercedes, it is doubtful that the system is or should be able to store a complete feature basis for it. If the basis is not complete, not all details of the object can be restored by sampling from the basis onto the mental stage.\nTherefore, not only are those details excluded from further reasoning, but basis transformations for resourceful thinking are impaired as well.\nHowever, the template should not contain too much detail – it should be typical for the object. A typical template of a concept is an image of an instance of that concept in such a way that the system’s feature extraction and reasoning processes are able to recognize that concept as quickly and as unambiguously as possible. For example, consider different images of a trapezoid. Fig. 4.1b shows atypical trapezoids since all of them seem to represent more regularities than are meant to imply. Parallelograms have parallel sides, rhombs have equal lengths, rectangles right angles and squares both. Therefore, a typical image of a trapezoid in Fig. 4.1c is more suitable to convey the concept. Conversely, non-trapezoids such as general tetragons are not suitable. Moreover, the trapezoid should not be degenerate, e.g. when the distance between the parallel lines is zero (Fig. 4.1d), nor should the sides cross, since this would allow the interpretation of two triangles touching each other at a corner (Fig. 4.1e). Thus, the a typical template contains exactly the right regularities and properties in order to conclude the intended concept. In such a way, typical templates are optimized for storing and transmitting information."

      "heading" : "4.3 Grounded commonsense reasoning",
      "text" : "Beyond the generation of concepts, the system has to be able to reason about them and answer queries about them correctly. Consider again the “house” in Fig. 4.1a. Given parametrized representations, the only information to be provided in order to define the scene is the position and side length of square and one point defining the roof top. This information is enough to generate a particular “house” on the board. After all, compression means that a lot of information is generated, “unpacked”, from a small amount of it.\nConsider now the amount of queries that can be answered. What is the base length of the “roof” triangle? Since the concepts of a square and triangle are activated and the scene is generated, the length of the base can be read off from\nthe scene. If a perpendicular is dropped from the top of the house, it lands in the middle of the house floor? The question can be answered affirmatively by simulating the perpendicular and measuring the position where it splits the floor. Similarly, one can simulate and answer queries about whether diagonals through the square cross in the middle and that they cut the right angle of the square in half. Or that the crossing point of diagonals is exactly below the top of the house.\nIt is easy to see that the number of possible queries about the image increases very quickly with the number of involved elements. The crucial point is that all those queries can be answered by the system without actually representing or deducing them in any way from the knowledge base. The adage “a picture is worth a thousand words” reflects the value of the present proposition. The traditional way to reason about such commonsense problems is to formalize it with logical statements and answering queries by backward chaining through the knowledge base. Apart from the drawbacks mentioned in ch. 3.3, I conjecture that the size of the knowledge base needed to answer all such queries in a scene grows much faster with the complexity of the scene than the number of parameters needed to generate the scene from compressed representations and thereby answering all such queries as well. For example, consider spatial relations between n objects. In principle, there can be n(n − 1) (asymmetric) relations between them. Given a particular scene with given object positions, the relations between them can readily be read off, as spacial relations are grounded features of the scene. In a formal model of the scene though, either all n(n−1) relations have to be stored in the knowledge base, or general rules of symmetry and transitivity and the like have to be introduced (e.g. “if above(a,b) then below(b,a)” or “if above(a,b) and above(b,c) then above(a,c)”). Things are already bad enough since the generalizability of those rules is limited and requires tremendous foresight by the programmer building a full mathematical description of the world. Even if such a description can be given such as in Winograd’s famous Blocks World (Winograd, 1971), it is far from clear that a complete set of rules can be provided and that would be able to answer all queries. Further, it is well known that the validity of a moderately true rule may dissolve after a repeated application (e.g. a transitive rule along a chain) – one of the main difficulties that limited the rise of fuzzy logic. All those problems dissolve when reasoning is grounded since no rules need to be applied. Instead, the relations of arbitrary objects can be extracted directly from the scene, while the context-dependent generalizability of the observations can still be preserved as argued in ch. 3.5.\nConclusion In this paper I have tried to pour my ideas on artificial general intelligence and on a path toward it into a coherent whole. There is hardly anything really new to them, except this particular selection and the hopefully visible line of thought shaping this selection into an engineering strategy.\nSince much is still half-baked, I would like to sketch the next steps to be done. First, the test for partial progress described in ch. 1.2 has to be worked out in practice, which means setting up a Turing machine and testing until what complexity level current state of the art compression techniques are able to stay general. For example, the celebrated Lempel-Ziv algorithm will be likely to fail at compressing a simple non-stationary sequence. There will be some complexity level at which all current algorithms will fail thereby setting up the research goal.\nSecond, it has to be researched how features are to be found in general. The hope is that one can start out with basic mathematical concepts (sets, functions, numbers) that turn out to be applicable quite generally. For example, after the first concepts such as points, lines etc. are defined, partonomies made up from them could be constructed thereby defining more complex objects. Hence, I suspect that the search for “concept primitives” could end with the set of simple but general mathematical concepts.\nThird, a strategy for recognizing and dealing with boundary problems has to be worked out. For example, one may establish that adding a number to the previous sequence entry works well, but breaks down at the very first entry, since there is no previous one. The system has to deal with the brittleness of its own generalizations. Interestingly, dealing with brittleness is similar to dealing with exceptions: one has to find the truth conditions of observations. It is always the same problem: a set of hypotheses explaining an observation has to be set up, seeing an error due to brittleness in this case. Therefore, the current framework shows the ability to attack the problem of brittleness.\nFinally, a demonstrator shall be built that implements my most important ideas and achieves a level of generality not encountered before."

Third, ungrounded representations have difficulties reacting to new situations where a new context leads to different conclusions.

It is argued that building a general data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity threshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby compressing the data increasingly at every",
