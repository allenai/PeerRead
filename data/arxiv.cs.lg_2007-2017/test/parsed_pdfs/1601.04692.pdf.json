I provide a fairly thorough treatment of the method of normalized graph cuts, a deeply original method due to Shi and Malik, including complete proofs. I also cover briefly the method of ratio cuts, and show how it can be viewed as a special case of normalized cuts. I include the necessary background on graphs and graph Laplacians. I then explain in detail how the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian can be used to draw a graph. This is an attractive application of graph Laplacians. The main thrust of this paper is the method of normalized cuts. I give a detailed account for K = 2 clusters, and also for K > 2 clusters, based on the work of Yu and Shi. I also show how both graph drawing and normalized cut K-clustering can be easily generalized to handle signed graphs, which are weighted graphs in which the weight matrix W may have negative coefficients. Intuitively, negative coefficients indicate distance or dissimilarity. The solution is to replace the degree matrix D by the matrix D in which absolute values of the weights are used, and to replace the Laplacian L = D −W by the signed Laplacian L = D −W . The signed Laplacian L is always positive semidefinite, and it may be positive definite (for unbalanced graphs, see Chapter 5). As far as I know, the generalization of K-way normalized clustering to signed graphs is new. Finally, I show how the method of ratio cuts, in which a cut is normalized by the size of the cluster rather than its volume, is just a special case of normalized cuts. All that needs to be done is to replace the normalized Laplacian Lsym by the unormalized Laplacian L. This is also true for signed graphs (where we replace Lsym by L).\nThree points that do not appear to have been clearly articulated before are elaborated:\n1. The solutions of the main optimization problem should be viewed as tuples in the K-fold cartesian product of projective space RPN−1.\n2. When K > 2, the solutions of the relaxed problem should be viewed as elements of the Grassmannian G(K,N).\n3. Two possible Riemannian distances are available to compare the closeness of solutions: (a) The distance on (RPN−1)K . (b) The distance on the Grassmannian.\nI also clarify what should be the necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix to represent a partition of the vertices of a graph to be clustered.\n4\nContents"

These notes are the result of my efforts to rectify this situation.\nI begin with a review of basic notions of graph theory. Even though the graph Laplacian is fundamentally associated with an undirected graph, I review the definition of both directed and undirected graphs. For both directed and undirected graphs, I define the degree matrix D, the incidence matrix B, and the adjacency matrix A. Then, I define a weighted graph. This is a pair (V,W ), where V is a finite set of nodes and W is a m×m symmetric matrix with nonnegative entries and zero diagonal entries (where m = |V |). For every node vi ∈ V , the degree d(vi) (or di) of vi is the sum of the weights of the edges adjacent to vi:\ndi = d(vi) = m∑ j=1 wi j.\nThe degree matrix is the diagonal matrix\nD = diag(d1, . . . , dm).\nGiven any subset of nodes A ⊆ V , we define the volume vol(A) of A as the sum of the weights of all edges adjacent to nodes in A:\nvol(A) = ∑ vi∈A m∑ j=1 wi j.\nThe notions of degree and volume are illustrated in Figure 1.1. Given any two subset\nA,B ⊆ V (not necessarily distinct), we define links(A,B) by\nlinks(A,B) = ∑\nvi∈A,vj∈B\nwi j.\n7"

      "text" : "The quantity links(A,A) = links(A,A) (where A = V − A denotes the complement of A in V ) measures how many links escape from A (and A). We define the cut of A as\ncut(A) = links(A,A).\nThe notions of cut is illustrated in Figure 1.2. The above concepts play a crucial role in the theory of normalized cuts. Then, I introduce the (unnormalized) graph Laplacian L of a directed graph G in an “old-fashion,” by showing that for any orientation of a graph G,\nBB> = D − A = L\nis an invariant. I also define the (unnormalized) graph Laplacian L of a weighted graph G = (V,W ) as L = D −W . I show that the notion of incidence matrix can be generalized\n9 to weighted graphs in a simple way. For any graph Gσ obtained by orienting the underlying graph of a weighted graph G = (V,W ), there is an incidence matrix Bσ such that\nBσ(Bσ)> = D −W = L.\nI also prove that\nx>Lx = 1\n2 m∑ i,j=1 wi j(xi − xj)2 for all x ∈ Rm.\nConsequently, x>Lx does not depend on the diagonal entries in W , and if wi j ≥ 0 for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . ,m}, then L is positive semidefinite. Then, if W consists of nonnegative entries, the eigenvalues 0 = λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λm of L are real and nonnegative, and there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of L. I show that the number of connected components of the graph G = (V,W ) is equal to the dimension of the kernel of L, which is also equal to the dimension of the kernel of the transpose (Bσ)> of any incidence matrix Bσ obtained by orienting the underlying graph of G.\nI also define the normalized graph Laplacians Lsym and Lrw, given by\nLsym = D −1/2LD−1/2 = I −D−1/2WD−1/2\nLrw = D −1L = I −D−1W,\nand prove some simple properties relating the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of L, Lsym and Lrw. These normalized graph Laplacians show up when dealing with normalized cuts.\nNext, I turn to graph drawings (Chapter 3). Graph drawing is a very attractive application of so-called spectral techniques, which is a fancy way of saying that that eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are used. Furthermore, it turns out that graph clustering using normalized cuts can be cast as a certain type of graph drawing.\nGiven an undirected graph G = (V,E), with |V | = m, we would like to draw G in Rn for n (much) smaller than m. The idea is to assign a point ρ(vi) in Rn to the vertex vi ∈ V , for every vi ∈ V , and to draw a line segment between the points ρ(vi) and ρ(vj). Thus, a graph drawing is a function ρ : V → Rn.\nWe define the matrix of a graph drawing ρ (in Rn) as a m× n matrix R whose ith row consists of the row vector ρ(vi) corresponding to the point representing vi in Rn. Typically, we want n < m; in fact n should be much smaller than m.\nSince there are infinitely many graph drawings, it is desirable to have some criterion to decide which graph is better than another. Inspired by a physical model in which the edges are springs, it is natural to consider a representation to be better if it requires the springs to be less extended. We can formalize this by defining the energy of a drawing R by\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\n‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2 ,"

      "text" : "where ρ(vi) is the ith row of R and ‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2 is the square of the Euclidean length of the line segment joining ρ(vi) and ρ(vj).\nThen, “good drawings” are drawings that minimize the energy function E . Of course, the trivial representation corresponding to the zero matrix is optimum, so we need to impose extra constraints to rule out the trivial solution.\nWe can consider the more general situation where the springs are not necessarily identical. This can be modeled by a symmetric weight (or stiffness) matrix W = (wij), with wij ≥ 0. In this case, our energy function becomes\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\nwij ‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2 .\nFollowing Godsil and Royle [10], we prove that\nE(R) = tr(R>LR),\nwhere L = D −W,\nis the familiar unnormalized Laplacian matrix associated with W , and where D is the degree matrix associated with W .\nIt can be shown that there is no loss in generality in assuming that the columns of R are pairwise orthogonal and that they have unit length. Such a matrix satisfies the equation R>R = I and the corresponding drawing is called an orthogonal drawing . This condition also rules out trivial drawings.\nThen, I prove the main theorem about graph drawings (Theorem 3.2), which essentially says that the matrix R of the desired graph drawing is constituted by the n eigenvectors of L associated with the smallest nonzero n eigenvalues of L. We give a number examples of graph drawings, many of which are borrowed or adapted from Spielman [21].\nThe next chapter (Chapter 4) contains the “meat” of this document. This chapter is devoted to the method of normalized graph cuts for graph clustering. This beautiful and deeply original method first published in Shi and Malik [20], has now come to be a “textbook chapter” of computer vision and machine learning. It was invented by Jianbo Shi and Jitendra Malik, and was the main topic of Shi’s dissertation. This method was extended to K ≥ 3 clusters by Stella Yu in her dissertation [23], and is also the subject of Yu and Shi [24].\nGiven a set of data, the goal of clustering is to partition the data into different groups according to their similarities. When the data is given in terms of a similarity graph G, where the weight wi j between two nodes vi and vj is a measure of similarity of vi and vj, the problem can be stated as follows: Find a partition (A1, . . . , AK) of the set of nodes V into different groups such that the edges between different groups have very low weight (which\n11\nindicates that the points in different clusters are dissimilar), and the edges within a group have high weight (which indicates that points within the same cluster are similar).\nThe above graph clustering problem can be formalized as an optimization problem, using the notion of cut mentioned earlier. If we want to partition V into K clusters, we can do so by finding a partition (A1, . . . , AK) that minimizes the quantity\ncut(A1, . . . , AK) = 1\n2 K∑ i=1 cut(Ai) = 1 2 K∑ i=1 links(Ai, Ai).\nFor K = 2, the mincut problem is a classical problem that can be solved efficiently, but in practice, it does not yield satisfactory partitions. Indeed, in many cases, the mincut solution separates one vertex from the rest of the graph. What we need is to design our cost function in such a way that it keeps the subsets Ai “reasonably large” (reasonably balanced).\nAn example of a weighted graph and a partition of its nodes into two clusters is shown in Figure 1.3.\nA way to get around this problem is to normalize the cuts by dividing by some measure of each subset Ai. A solution using the volume vol(Ai) of Ai (for K = 2) was proposed and investigated in a seminal paper of Shi and Malik [20]. Subsequently, Yu (in her dissertation [23]) and Yu and Shi [24] extended the method to K > 2 clusters. The idea is to minimize the cost function\nNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 links(Ai, Ai) vol(Ai) = K∑ i=1 cut(Ai, Ai) vol(Ai) ."

      "text" : "The first step is to express our optimization problem in matrix form. In the case of two clusters, a single vector Xx can be used to describe the partition (A1, A2) = (A,A). We need to choose the structure of this vector in such a way that\nNcut(A,A) = X>LX\nX>DX ,\nwhere the term on the right-hand side is a Rayleigh ratio.\nAfter careful study of the original papers, I discovered various facts that were implicit in these works, but I feel are important to be pointed out explicitly.\nFirst, I realized that it is important to pick a vector representation which is invariant under multiplication by a nonzero scalar, because the Rayleigh ratio is scale-invariant, and it is crucial to take advantage of this fact to make the denominator go away. This implies that the solutions X are points in the projective space RPN−1. This was my first revelation.\nLet N = |V | be the number of nodes in the graph G. In view of the desire for a scaleinvariant representation, it is natural to assume that the vector X is of the form\nX = (x1, . . . , xN),\nwhere xi ∈ {a, b} for i = 1, . . . , N , for any two distinct real numbers a, b. This is an indicator vector in the sense that, for i = 1, . . . , N ,\nxi = { a if vi ∈ A b if vi /∈ A.\nThe choice a = +1, b = −1 is natural, but premature. The correct interpretation is really to view X as a representative of a point in the real projective space RPN−1, namely the point P(X) of homogeneous coordinates (x1 : · · · : xN).\nLet d = 1>D1 and α = vol(A), where 1 denotes the vector whose components are all equal to 1. I prove that\nNcut(A,A) = X>LX\nX>DX\nholds iff the following condition holds:\naα + b(d− α) = 0. (†)\nNote that condition (†) applied to a vector X whose components are a or b is equivalent to the fact that X is orthogonal to D1, since\nX>D1 = αa+ (d− α)b,\nwhere α = vol({vi ∈ V | xi = a}).\n13\nIf we let\nX = { (x1, . . . , xN) | xi ∈ {a, b}, a, b ∈ R, a, b 6= 0 } ,\nour solution set is\nK = { X ∈ X | X>D1 = 0 } .\nActually, to be perfectly rigorous, we are looking for solutions in RPN−1, so our solution set is really\nP(K) = { (x1 : · · · : xN) ∈ RPN−1 | (x1, . . . , xN) ∈ K } .\nConsequently, our minimization problem can be stated as follows:\nProblem PNC1\nminimize X>LX X>DX subject to X>D1 = 0, X ∈ X .\nIt is understood that the solutions are points P(X) in RPN−1.\nSince the Rayleigh ratio and the constraints X>D1 = 0 and X ∈ X are scale-invariant, we are led to the following formulation of our problem:\nProblem PNC2\nminimize X>LX subject to X>DX = 1, X>D1 = 0, X ∈ X .\nBecause problem PNC2 requires the constraint X>DX = 1 to be satisfied, it does not have the same set of solutions as problem PNC1 , but PNC2 and PNC1 are equivalent in the sense that they have the same set of minimal solutions as points P(X) ∈ RPN−1 given by their homogeneous coordinates X. More precisely, if X is any minimal solution of PNC1, then X/(X>DX)1/2 is a minimal solution of PNC2 (with the same minimal value for the objective functions), and if X is a minimal solution of PNC2, then λX is a minimal solution for PNC1 for all λ 6= 0 (with the same minimal value for the objective functions).\nNow, as in the classical papers, we consider the relaxation of the above problem obtained by dropping the condition that X ∈ X , and proceed as usual. However, having found a solution Z to the relaxed problem, we need to find a discrete solution X such that d(X,Z) is minimum in RPN−1. All this is presented in Section 4.2.\nIf the number of clusters K is at least 3, then we need to choose a matrix representation for partitions on the set of vertices. It is important that such a representation be scaleinvariant, and it is also necessary to state necessary and sufficient conditions for such matrices to represent a partition (to the best of our knowledge, these points are not clearly articulated in the literature)."

Inspired by what we did when K = 2, we assume that the vector Xj is of the form\nXj = (xj1, . . . , x j N),\nwhere xji ∈ {aj, bj} for j = 1, . . . , K and i = 1, . . . , N , and where aj, bj are any two distinct real numbers. The vector Xj is an indicator vector for Aj in the sense that, for i = 1, . . . , N ,\nxji = { aj if vi ∈ Aj bj if vi /∈ Aj.\nThe choice {aj, bj} = {0, 1} for j = 1, . . . , K is natural, but premature. I show that if we pick bi = 0, then we have\ncut(Aj, Aj)\nvol(Aj) =\n(Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj j = 1, . . . , K,\nwhich implies that\nNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) = K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj .\nThen, I give necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix X to represent a partition.\nIf we let X = {\n[X1 . . . XK ] | Xj = aj(xj1, . . . , x j N), x j i ∈ {1, 0}, aj ∈ R, Xj 6= 0 } (note that the condition Xj 6= 0 implies that aj 6= 0), then the set of matrices representing partitions of V into K blocks is\nK = { X = [X1 · · · XK ] | X ∈ X ,\n(X i)>DXj = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j, X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1 } .\nAs in the case K = 2, to be rigorous, the solution are really K-tuples of points in RPN−1, so our solution set is really\nP(K) = { (P(X1), . . . ,P(XK)) | [X1 · · · XK ] ∈ K } .\nRemark: For any X ∈ X , the condition X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1 is redundant. However, when we relax the problem and drop the condition X ∈ X , the condition X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1 captures the fact 1 should be in the range of X.\n15\nIn view of the above, we have our first formulation of K-way clustering of a graph using normalized cuts, called problem PNC1 (the notation PNCX is used in Yu [23], Section 2.1):\nK-way Clustering of a graph using Normalized Cut, Version 1: Problem PNC1\nminimize K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj subject to (X i)>DXj = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j, X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1, X ∈ X .\nAs in the case K = 2, the solutions that we are seeking are K-tuples (P(X1), . . . ,P(XK)) of points in RPN−1 determined by their homogeneous coordinates X1, . . . , XK .\nThen, step by step, we transform problem PNC1 into an equivalent problem PNC2. We eventually relax PNC1 into (∗1) and PNC2 into (∗2), by dropping the condition that X ∈ X .\nOur second revelation is that the relaxation (∗2) of version 2 of our minimization problem (PNC2), which is equivalent to version 1, reveals that that the solutions of the relaxed problem (∗2) are members of the Grassmannian G(K,N).\nThis leads us to our third revelation: we have two choices of metrics to compare solutions : (1) a metric on (RPN−1)K ; (2) a metric on G(K,N). We discuss the first choice, which is the choice implicitly adopted by Shi and Yu. However, in approximating a discrete solution X by a solution Z of problem (∗1) we allow more general transformations of the form Q = RΛ, where R ∈ O(K), and Λ is a diagonal invertible matrix. Thus we seek R and Λ to minimize ‖X − ZRΛ‖F . This yields better discrete solutions X.\nIn Chapter 5, I show how both the spectral method for graph drawing and the normalizedcut method for K clusters generalize to signed graphs, which are graphs whose weight matrix W may contain negative entries. The intuition is that negative weights indicate dissimilarity or distance.\nThe first obstacle is that the degree matrix may now contain negative entries. As a consequence, the Laplacian L may no longer be positive semidefinite, and worse, D−1/2 may not exist.\nA simple remedy is to use the absolute values of the weights in the degree matrix! We denote this matrix by D, and define the signed Laplacian as L = D − W . The idea to use positive degrees of nodes in the degree matrix of a signed graph with weights (−1, 0, 1) occurs in Hou [14]. The natural step of using absolute values of weights in the degree matrix is taken by Kolluri, Shewchuk and O’Brien [15] and Kunegis et al. [16].\nAs we will see, this trick allows the whole machinery that we have presented to be used to attack the problem of clustering signed graphs using normalized cuts."

I also show that\nx>Lx = 1\n2 m∑ i,j=1 |wij|(xi − sgn(wij)xj)2 for all x ∈ Rm.\nAs in Section 4.3, given a partition of V into K clusters (A1, . . . , AK), if we represent the jth block of this partition by a vector Xj such that\nXji = { aj if vi ∈ Aj 0 if vi /∈ Aj,\nfor some aj 6= 0, then the following result holds: For any vector Xj representing the jth block of a partition (A1, . . . , AK) of V , we have\n(Xj)>LXj = a2j(cut(Aj, Aj) + 2links −(Aj, Aj)).\nThe above suggests defining the key notion of signed normalized cut: The signed normalized cut sNcut(A1, . . . , AK) of the partition (A1, . . . , AK) is defined as\nsNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) + 2 K∑ j=1 links−(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) .\nOur definition of a signed normalized cut appears to be novel.\nBased on previous computations, we have\nsNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj ,\nwhere X is the N ×K matrix whose jth column is Xj. Observe that minimizing sNcut(A1, . . . , AK) amounts to minimizing the number of positive and negative edges between clusters, and also minimizing the number of negative edges within clusters. This second minimization captures the intuition that nodes connected by a negative edge should not be together (they do not “like” each other; they should be far from each other). It would be preferable if the notion of signed cut only took into account the contribution links+(Aj, Aj) of the positively weighted edges between disjoint clusters, but we have not found a way to achieve this.\n17\nSince\nsNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj ,\nthe whole machinery of Sections 4.3 and 4.5 can be applied with D replaced by D and L replaced by L. However, there is a new phenomenon, which is that L may be positive definite. As a consequence, 1 is not always an eigenvector of L.\nFollowing Kunegis et al. [16], we show that the signed Laplacian L is positive definite iff G is unbalanced, which means that it contains some cycle with an odd number of negative edges. We also characterize when a graph is balanced in terms of the kernel of the transpose B> of any of its incidence matrices.\nTo generalize the graph drawing method to signed graphs, we explain that if the energy function E(R) of a graph drawing is redefined to be\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\n|wij| ‖ρ(vi)− sgn(wij)ρ(vj)‖2 ,\nthen we obtain orthogonal graph drawings of minimal energy, and we give some examples.\nWe conclude this survey with a short chapter on graph clustering using ratio cuts. The idea of ratio cut is to replace the volume vol(Aj) of each block Aj of the partition by its size, |Aj| (the number of nodes in Aj). Given an unsigned graph (V,W ), the ratio cut Rcut(A1, . . . , AK) of the partition (A1, . . . , AK) is defined as\nRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) |Aj| .\nIf we represent the jth block of this partition by a vector Xj such that\nXji = { aj if vi ∈ Aj 0 if vi /∈ Aj,\nfor some aj 6= 0, then we obtain\nRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) |Aj| = K∑ i=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>Xj .\nOn the other hand, the normalized cut is given by\nNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) = K∑ i=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj ."

Under this interpretation, Rm is viewed as RV . Similarly, a vector y ∈ Rn can be viewed as a function in RE. This point of view is often useful. For example, the incidence matrix B can be interpreted as a linear map from RE to RV , the boundary map, and B> can be interpreted as a linear map from RV to RE, the coboundary map.\nRemark: Some authors adopt the opposite convention of sign in defining the incidence matrix, which means that their incidence matrix is −B.\nUndirected graphs are obtained from directed graphs by forgetting the orientation of the edges.\nDefinition 2.4.

Let G = (V,E) be any undirected graph with m vertices, n edges, and c connected components. For any orientation σ of G, if B is the incidence matrix of the oriented graph Gσ, then c = dim(Ker (B>)), and B has rank m − c.

Since B> is a n×m matrix, we have\nm = dim(Ker (B>)) + rank(B>),\nso rank(B>) = m− c. Since B and B> have the same rank, rank(B) = m− c, as claimed. A vector z ∈ Rm belongs to the kernel of B> iff B>z = 0 iff z>B = 0. In view of the definition of B, for every edge {vi, vj} of G, the column of B corresponding to the oriented edge σ({vi, vj}) has zero entries except for a +1 and a −1 in position i and position j or vice-versa, so we have\nzi = zj.\nAn easy induction on the length of the path shows that if there is a path from vi to vj in G (unoriented), then zi = zj. Therefore, z has a constant value on any connected component of G. It follows that every vector z ∈ Ker (B>) can be written uniquely as a linear combination\nz = λ1z 1 + · · ·+ λczc,\nwhere the vector zi corresponds to the ith connected component Ki of G and is defined such that\nzij = { 1 iff vj ∈ Ki 0 otherwise.\nThis shows that dim(Ker (B>)) = c, and that Ker (B>) has a basis consisting of indicator vectors.\nFollowing common practice, we denote by 1 the (column) vector whose components are all equal to 1.

Thus, we assign a nonnegative weight wi j to an edge {vi, vj}; the smaller wi j is, the weaker is the link (or similarity) between vi and vj, and the greater wi j is, the stronger is the link (or similarity) between vi and vj.\nDefinition 2.9. A weighted graph is a pair G = (V,W ), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} is a set of nodes or vertices , and W is a symmetric matrix called the weight matrix , such that wi j ≥ 0 for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . ,m}, and wi i = 0 for i = 1, . . . ,m.

      "text" : "Let G = (V,E) be some undirected graph. It is often desirable to draw a graph, usually in the plane but possibly in 3D, and it turns out that the graph Laplacian can be used to design surprisingly good methods. Say |V | = m. The idea is to assign a point ρ(vi) in Rn to the vertex vi ∈ V , for every vi ∈ V , and to draw a line segment between the points ρ(vi) and ρ(vj) iff there is an edge {vi, vj}. Thus, a graph drawing is a function ρ : V → Rn.\nWe define the matrix of a graph drawing ρ (in Rn) as a m× n matrix R whose ith row consists of the row vector ρ(vi) corresponding to the point representing vi in Rn. Typically, we want n < m; in fact n should be much smaller than m. A representation is balanced iff the sum of the entries of every column is zero, that is,\n1>R = 0.\nIf a representation is not balanced, it can be made balanced by a suitable translation. We may also assume that the columns of R are linearly independent, since any basis of the column space also determines the drawing. Thus, from now on, we may assume that n ≤ m.\nRemark: A graph drawing ρ : V → Rn is not required to be injective, which may result in degenerate drawings where distinct vertices are drawn as the same point. For this reason, we prefer not to use the terminology graph embedding , which is often used in the literature. This is because in differential geometry, an embedding always refers to an injective map. The term graph immersion would be more appropriate.\nAs explained in Godsil and Royle [10], we can imagine building a physical model of G by connecting adjacent vertices (in Rn) by identical springs. Then, it is natural to consider a representation to be better if it requires the springs to be less extended. We can formalize this by defining the energy of a drawing R by\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\n‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2 ,\n37"

Of course, the trivial representation corresponding to the zero matrix is optimum, so we need to impose extra constraints to rule out the trivial solution.\nWe can consider the more general situation where the springs are not necessarily identical. This can be modeled by a symmetric weight (or stiffness) matrix W = (wij), with wij ≥ 0. Then our energy function becomes\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\nwij ‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2 .\nIt turns out that this function can be expressed in terms of the Laplacian L = D−W . The following proposition is shown in Godsil and Royle [10]. We give a slightly more direct proof.\nProposition 3.1. Let G = (V,W ) be a weighted graph, with |V | = m and W an m × m symmetric matrix, and let R be the matrix of a graph drawing ρ of G in Rn (a m×n matrix). If L = D −W is the unnormalized Laplacian matrix associated with W , then\nE(R) = tr(R>LR).\nProof. Since ρ(vi) is the ith row of R (and ρ(vj) is the jth row of R), if we denote the kth column of R by Rk, using Proposition 2.4, we have\nE(R) = ∑\n{vi,vj}∈E\nwij ‖ρ(vi)− ρ(vj)‖2\n= n∑ k=1 ∑ {vi,vj}∈E wij(Rik −Rjk)2\n= n∑ k=1 1 2 m∑ i,j=1 wij(Rik −Rjk)2\n= n∑ k=1 (Rk)>LRk = tr(R>LR),\nas claimed.\nNote that L1 = 0,\nas we already observed.\nSince the matrix R>LR is symmetric, it has real eigenvalues.

      "text" : "If R is the matrix of a graph drawing in Rn, then for any invertible matrix M , the map that assigns ρ(vi)M to vi is another graph drawing of G, and these two drawings convey the same amount of information. From this point of view, a graph drawing is determined by the column space of R. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the columns of R are pairwise orthogonal and that they have unit length. Such a matrix satisfies the equation R>R = I, and the corresponding drawing is called an orthogonal drawing . This condition also rules out trivial drawings. The following result tells us how to find minimum energy orthogonal balanced graph drawings, provided the graph is connected.\nTheorem 3.2. Let G = (V,W ) be a weigted graph with |V | = m. If L = D −W is the (unnormalized) Laplacian of G, and if the eigenvalues of L are 0 = λ1 < λ2 ≤ λ3 ≤ . . . ≤ λm, then the minimal energy of any balanced orthogonal graph drawing of G in Rn is equal to λ2+· · ·+λn+1 (in particular, this implies that n < m). The m×n matrix R consisting of any unit eigenvectors u2, . . . , un+1 associated with λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λn+1 yields a balanced orthogonal graph drawing of minimal energy; it satisfies the condition R>R = I.\nProof. We present the proof given in Godsil and Royle [10] (Section 13.4, Theorem 13.4.1). The key point is that the sum of the n smallest eigenvalues of L is a lower bound for tr(R>LR). This can be shown using an argument using the Rayleigh ratio; see Proposition A.3 (the Poincaré separation theorem). Then, any n eigenvectors (u1, . . . , un) associated with λ1, . . . , λn achieve this bound. Because the first eigenvalue of L is λ1 = 0 and because we are assuming that λ2 > 0, we have u1 = 1/ √ m. Since the uj are pairwise orthogonal\nfor i = 2, . . . , n and since ui is orthogonal to u1 = 1/ √ m, the entries in ui add up to 0. Consequently, for any ` with 2 ≤ ` ≤ n, by deleting u1 and using (u2, . . . , u`), we obtain a balanced orthogonal graph drawing in R`−1 with the same energy as the orthogonal graph drawing in R` using (u1, u2, . . . , u`). Conversely, from any balanced orthogonal drawing in R`−1 using (u2, . . . , u`), we obtain an orthogonal graph drawing in R` using (u1, u2, . . . , u`) with the same energy. Therefore, the minimum energy of a balanced orthogonal graph drawing in Rn is equal to the minimum energy of an orthogonal graph drawing in Rn+1, and this minimum is λ2 + · · ·+ λn+1.\nSince 1 spans the nullspace of L, using u1 (which belongs to KerL) as one of the vectors in R would have the effect that all points representing vertices of G would have the same first coordinate. This would mean that the drawing lives in a hyperplane in Rn, which is undesirable, especially when n = 2, where all vertices would be collinear. This is why we omit the first eigenvector u1.\nObserve that for any orthogonal n× n matrix Q, since\ntr(R>LR) = tr(Q>R>LRQ),\nthe matrix RQ also yields a minimum orthogonal graph drawing. This amounts to applying the rigid motion Q> to the rows of R.\nIn summary, if λ2 > 0, an automatic method for drawing a graph in R2 is this:"

So, let X = { (x1, . . . , xN) | xi ∈ {a, b}, a, b ∈ R, a, b 6= 0 } ,\nso that our solution set is K = { X ∈ X | X>D1 = 0 } ,\nbecause by previous observations, since vectors X ∈ X have nonzero components, X>D1 = 0 implies that α 6= 0, α 6= d, and a 6= b, where α = vol({vi ∈ V | xi = a}). Actually, to be perfectly rigorous, we are looking for solutions in RPN−1, so our solution set is really\nP(K) = { (x1 : · · · : xN) ∈ RPN−1 | (x1, . . . , xN) ∈ K } .\nConsequently, our minimization problem can be stated as follows:\nProblem PNC1\nminimize X>LX X>DX subject to X>D1 = 0, X ∈ X .\nIt is understood that the solutions are points P(X) in RPN−1.\nSince the Rayleigh ratio and the constraints X>D1 = 0 and X ∈ X are scale-invariant (for any λ 6= 0, the Rayleigh ratio does not change if X is replaced by λX, X ∈ X iff λX ∈ X , and (λX)>D1 = λX>D1 = 0), we are led to the following formulation of our problem:\nProblem PNC2\nminimize X>LX subject to X>DX = 1, X>D1 = 0, X ∈ X .\nBecause problem PNC2 requires the constraint X>DX = 1 to be satisfied, it does not have the same set of solutions as problem PNC1. Nevertherless, problem PNC2 is equivalent to problem PNC1, in the sense that if X is any minimal solution of PNC1, then X/(X>DX)1/2 is a minimal solution of PNC2 (with the same minimal value for the objective functions), and if X is a minimal solution of PNC2, then λX is a minimal solution for PNC1 for all λ 6= 0 (with the same minimal value for the objective functions). Equivalently,\n4.2. SPECIAL CASE: 2-WAY CLUSTERING USING NORMALIZED CUTS 51\nproblems PNC1 and PNC2 have the same set of minimal solutions as points P(X) ∈ RPN−1 given by their homogeneous coordinates X.\nUnfortunately, this is an NP-complete problem, as shown by Shi and Malik [20]. As often with hard combinatorial problems, we can look for a relaxation of our problem, which means looking for an optimum in a larger continuous domain. After doing this, the problem is to find a discrete solution which is close to a continuous optimum of the relaxed problem.\nThe natural relaxation of this problem is to allow X to be any nonzero vector in RN , and we get the problem:\nminimize X>LX subject to X>DX = 1, X>D1 = 0.\nIn order to apply Proposition A.2, we make the change of variable Y = D1/2X, so that X = D−1/2Y . Then, the condition X>DX = 1 becomes\nY >Y = 1,\nthe condition X>D1 = 0\nbecomes Y >D1/21 = 0,\nand X>LX = Y >D−1/2LD−1/2Y.\nWe obtain the problem:\nminimize Y >D−1/2LD−1/2Y subject to Y >Y = 1, Y >D1/21 = 0.\nBecause L1 = 0, the vector D1/21 belongs to the nullspace of the symmetric Laplacian Lsym = D\n−1/2LD−1/2. By Proposition A.2, minima are achieved by any unit eigenvector Y of the second eigenvalue ν2 > 0 of Lsym. Since 0 is the smallest eigenvalue of Lsym and since D1/21 belongs to the nullspace of Lsym, as the eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal, the vector Y is orthogonal to D1/21, so the constraint Y >D1/21 = 0 is satisfied. Then, Z = D−1/2Y is a solution of our original relaxed problem. Note that because Z is nonzero and orthogonal to D1, a vector with positive entries, it must have negative and positive entries.\nThe next question is to figure how close is Z to an exact solution in X . Actually, because solutions are points in RPN−1, the correct statement of the question is: Find an exact solution P(X) ∈ P(X ) which is the closest (in a suitable sense) to the approximate solution P(Z) ∈ RPN−1. However, because X is closed under the antipodal map, as explained in Appendix B, minimizing the distance d(P(X),P(Z)) on RPN−1 is equivalent to minimizing the Euclidean distance ‖X − Z‖2, where X and Z are representatives of P(X) and P(Z) on"

If all entries in Z are nonzero, due to the projective nature of the solution set, it seems reasonable to say that the partition of V is defined by the signs of the entries in Z. Thus, A will consist of nodes those vi for which xi > 0. Elements corresponding to zero entries can be assigned to either A or A, unless additional information is available. In our implementation, they are assigned to A.\nHere are some examples of normalized cuts found by a fairly naive implementation of the method.

The normalized Laplacian of this weight matrix has the eigenvalue 1.0909 with multiplicity 11 (and any incidence matrix B3 associated with W3 has the singular value 1.0445 with multiplicity 11).

In fact, examination of the eigenvectors of U3 reveal very unbalanced solutions.\nFor graphs where the number N of edges is very large and the number of edges is O(N2), computing the SVD of the incidence matrix B is not practical. Instead, we compute an SVD for Lsym, which appears to be more stable that diagonalizing Lsym.\nOur naive algorithm treated zero as a positive entry. Now, using the fact that\nb = − αa d− α ,\na better solution is to look for a vector X ∈ RN with Xi ∈ {a, b} which is closest to a minimum Z of the relaxed problem (in the sense that ‖X − Z‖ is minimized) and with ‖X‖ = ‖Z‖. We designed the following algorithm.\nA vector X describing a partition (A,A) is of the form\nXi = { a if vi ∈ A −βa otherwise,\nwith\nα = vol({vi | vi ∈ A}), β = α\nd− α ,\nand where a > 0 is chosen so that ∥∥X∥∥ = ‖Z‖. For any solution Z of the relaxed problem, let I+Z = {i | Zi > 0} be the set of indices of positive entries in Z, I − Z = {i | Zi < 0} the set of indices of negative entries in Z, I0Z = {i | Zi = 0} the set of indices of zero entries in Z. Initially, it makes sense to form a discrete approximation X of Z such that all entries of index in I+Z are assigned the value a > 0 (to be determined later), and all other entries are assigned the value −βa. In order for X and Z to have the same norm, since∥∥X∥∥2 = na + β2(N − na) with\nna = |I+Z |, α = vol({vi | i ∈ I + Z }), β =\nα\nd− α ,\nwe set\na = ‖Z‖√\n(na + β2(N − na)) .\nThe problems is to determine whether an entry with an index i ∈ I0Z (which is initially assigned the value −βa) should be reassigned the value a. To make the decision, we form the new discrete solution X̃ obtained from X by adding the index i to I+Z , and updating\n4.2.

We delete i from I0Z , and repeat step (2). After a finite number of steps, I0Z becomes empty and we obtain a discrete solution X which is typically closer to X than the starting approximate solution.\nWe also need to decide whether to start with Z or −Z (remember that solution are determined up to a nonzero scalar). We proceed as follows. Let Z+ and Z− be the vectors given by\nZ+i = { Zi if i ∈ I+Z 0 if i /∈ I+Z\nZ−i = { Zi if i ∈ I−Z 0 if i /∈ I−Z .\nAlso let na = |I+Z |, nb = |I − Z |, let a and b be the average of the positive and negative entries in Z respectively, that is,\na =\n∑ i∈I+Z Zi\nna b =\n∑ i∈I−Z Zi\nnb ,\nand let Z+ and Z− be the vectors given by\n(Z+)i = { a if i ∈ I+Z 0 if i /∈ I+Z\n(Z−)i = { b if i ∈ I−Z 0 if i /∈ I−Z .\nIf ∥∥Z+ − Z+∥∥ > ∥∥Z− − Z−∥∥, then replace Z by −Z.

Two crucial issues need to be addressed (to the best of our knowledge, these points are not clearly articulated in the literature).\n1. The choice of a matrix representation for partitions on the set of vertices. It is important that such a representation be scale-invariant. It is also necessary to state necessary and sufficient conditions for such matrices to represent a partition.\n2. The choice of a metric to compare solutions. It turns out that the space of discrete solutions can be viewed as a subset of the K-fold product (RPN−1)K of the projective space RPN−1. Version 1 of the formulation of our minimization problem (PNC1) makes this point clear. However, the relaxation (∗2) of version 2 of our minimization problem (PNC2), which is equivalent to version 1, reveals that that the solutions of the relaxed problem (∗2) are members of the Grassmannian G(K,N). Thus, we have two choices of metrics: (1) a metric on (RPN−1)K ; (2) a metric on G(K,N). We discuss the first choice, which is the choice implicitly adopted by Shi and Yu. Actually, it appears that it is difficult to deal with the product metric on (RPN−1)K induced by a metric on RPN−1. Instead, we approximate a metric on (RPN−1)K using the Frobenius norm; see Section 4.5 for details.\n4.3. K-WAY CLUSTERING USING NORMALIZED CUTS 57\nWe describe a partition (A1, . . . , AK) of the set of nodes V by an N × K matrix X = [X1 · · ·XK ] whose columns X1, . . . , XK are indicator vectors of the partition (A1, . . . , AK). Inspired by what we did in Section 4.2, we assume that the vector Xj is of the form\nXj = (xj1, . . . , x j N),\nwhere xji ∈ {aj, bj} for j = 1, . . . , K and i = 1, . . . , N , and where aj, bj are any two distinct real numbers. The vector Xj is an indicator vector for Aj in the sense that, for i = 1, . . . , N ,\nxji = { aj if vi ∈ Aj bj if vi /∈ Aj.\nWhen {aj, bj} = {0, 1} for j = 1, . . . , K, such a matrix is called a partition matrix by Yu and Shi. However, such a choice is premature, since it is better to have a scale-invariant representation to make the denominators of the Rayleigh ratios go away.\nSince the partition (A1, . . . , AK) consists of nonempty pairwise disjoint blocks whose union is V , some conditions on X are required to reflect these properties, but we will worry about this later.\nAs in Section 4.2, we seek conditions on the ajs and the bjs in order to express the normalized cut Ncut(A1, . . . , AK) as a sum of Rayleigh ratios. Then, we reformulate our optimization problem in a more convenient form, by chasing the denominators in the Rayleigh ratios, and by expressing the objective function in terms of the trace of a certain matrix. This will reveal the important fact that the solutions of the relaxed problem are right-invariant under multiplication by a K ×K orthogonal matrix.\nLet d = 1>D1 and αj = vol(Aj), so that α1 + · · ·+αK = d. Then, vol(Aj) = d−αj, and as in Section 4.2, we have\n(Xj)>LXj = (aj − bj)2 cut(Aj, Aj), (Xj)>DXj = αja 2 j + (d− αj)b2j .\nWhen K ≥ 3, unlike the case K = 2, in general we have cut(Aj, Aj) 6= cut(Ak, Ak) if j 6= k, and since\nNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) ,\nwe would like to choose aj, bj so that\ncut(Aj, Aj)\nvol(Aj) =\n(Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj j = 1, . . . , K,\nbecause this implies that\nµ(X) = Ncut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) = K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj ."

Now, because D is a diagonal matrix with positive entries and because the nonzero entries in each column of X have the same sign, for any i 6= j, the condition\n(X i)>Xj = 0\nis equivalent to (X i)>DXj = 0, (∗∗)\nsince, as above, it means that for k = 1, . . . , N , if xik 6= 0 then x j k = 0.

It is not immediately obvious how to state conveniently this condition in matrix form.\nObserve that the diagonal entries of the matrix XX> are the square Euclidean norms of the rows of X. Therefore, we can assert that these entries are all nonzero. Let DIAG be the function which returns the diagonal matrix (containing the diagonal of A),\nDIAG(A) = diag(a1 1, . . . , ann),\nfor any square matrix A = (ai j). Then, the condition for the rows of X to be nonzero can be stated as\ndet(DIAG(XX>)) 6= 0.\nSince every row of any matrix X representing a partition has a single nonzero entry aj, we have X>X = diag ( n1a 2 1, . . . , nKa 2 K ) ,\nwhere nj is the number of elements in Aj, the jth block of the partition. Therefore, an equivalent condition for the columns of X to be nonzero is\ndet(X>X) 6= 0.\nRemark: The matrix\nDIAG(XX>)−1/2X\nis the result of normalizing the rows of X so that they have Euclidean norm 1. This normalization step is used by Yu [23] in the search for a discrete solution closest to a solution of a relaxation of our original problem. For our special matrices representing partitions, normalizing the rows will have the effect of rescaling the columns (if row i has aj in column j, then all nonzero entries in column j are equal to aj), but for a more general matrix, this is false. Thus, in general, DIAG(XX>)−1/2X is not a solution of the original problem. Still, as we will see in Section 4.5, this matrix is a pretty good approximation to a discrete solution.\nAnother condition which does not involve explicitly a determinant and is scale-invariant stems from the observation that not only\nX>X = diag ( n1a 2 1, . . . , nKa 2 K ) ,\nbut\nX>1N =  n1a1... nKaK  ,\n4.3.

Consequently, if X>X is invertible, condition (†) can also be written as\nXX+1N = 1N .\nHowever, it is well known that XX+ is the orthogonal projection of RK onto the range of X (see Gallier [8], Section 14.1), so the condition XX+1N = 1N is equivalent to the fact that 1N belongs to the range of X. In retrospect, this should have been obvious since the columns of a solution X satisfy the equation\na−11 X 1 + · · ·+ a−1K X K = 1N .\nWe emphasize that it is important to use conditions that are invariant under multiplication by a nonzero scalar, because the Rayleigh ratio is scale-invariant, and it is crucial to take advantage of this fact to make the denominators go away.\nIf we let X = {\n[X1 . . .

For any orthogonal K ×K matrix R, any symmetric N × N matrix A, and any N ×K matrix X = [X1 · · · XK ], the following properties hold:\n(1) µ(X) = tr(Λ−1X>LX), where\nΛ = diag((X1)>DX1, . . . , (XK)>DXK).\n(2) If (X1)>DX1 = · · · = (XK)>DXK = α2, then\nµ(X) = µ(XR) = 1\nα2 tr(X>LX).\n(3) The condition X>AX = α2I is preserved if X is replaced by XR.\n(4) The condition X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1 is preserved if X is replaced by XR.\nNow, by Proposition 4.1(1) and the fact that the conditions in PNC1 are scale-invariant, we are led to the following formulation of our problem:\nminimize tr(X>LX) subject to (X i)>DXj = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j, (Xj)>DXj = 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ K, X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1, X ∈ X .\nConditions on lines 2 and 3 can be combined in the equation\nX>DX = I,\nand, we obtain the following formulation of our minimization problem:\nK-way Clustering of a graph using Normalized Cut, Version 2: Problem PNC2\nminimize tr(X>LX) subject to X>DX = I,\nX(X>X)−1X>1 = 1, X ∈ X .\nBecause problem PNC2 requires the constraint X>DX = I to be satisfied, it does not have the same set of solutions as problem PNC1. Nevertherless, problem PNC2 is equivalent to problem PNC1, in the sense that for every minimal solution (X1, . . . , XK) of PNC1, (((X1)>DX1)−1/2X1, . . . , ((XK)>DXK)−1/2XK) is a minimal solution of PNC2 (with the same minimum for the objective functions), and that for every minimal solution (Z1, . . . , Zk)\n66 CHAPTER 4. GRAPH CLUSTERING\nof PNC2, (λ1Z 1, . . . , λKZ K) is a minimal solution of PNC1, for all λi 6= 0, i = 1, . . . , K (with the same minimum for the objective functions). In other words, problems PNC1 and PNC2 have the same set of minimal solutions as K-tuples of points (P(X1), . . . ,P(XK)) in RPN−1 determined by their homogeneous coordinates X1, . . . , XK .\nFormulation PNC2 reveals that finding a minimum normalized cut has a geometric interpretation in terms of the graph drawings discussed in Section 3.1. Indeed, PNC2 has the following equivalent formulation: Find a minimal energy graph drawing X in RK of the weighted graph G = (V,W ) such that:\n1. The matrix X is orthogonal with respect to the inner product 〈−,−〉D in RN induced by D, with\n〈x, y〉D = x >Dy, x, y ∈ RN .\n2. The rows of X are nonzero; this means that no vertex vi ∈ V is assigned to the origin of RK (the zero vector 0K).\n3. Every vertex vi is assigned a point of the form (0, . . . , 0, aj, 0, . . . , 0) on some axis (in RK).\n4. Every axis in RK is assigned at least some vertex.\nCondition 1 can be reduced to the standard condition for graph drawings (R>R = I) by making the change of variable Y = D1/2X or equivalently X = D−1/2Y . Indeed,\ntr(X>LX) = tr(Y >D−1/2LD−1/2Y ),\nso we use the normalized Laplacian Lsym = D −1/2LD−1/2 instead of L,\nX>DX = Y >Y = I,\nand conditions (2), (3), (4) are preserved under the change of variable Y = D1/2X, since D1/2 is invertible. However, conditions (2), (3), (4) are “hard” constraints, especially condition (3). In fact, condition (3) implies that the columns of X are orthogonal with respect to both the Euclidean inner product and the inner product 〈−,−〉D, so condition (1) is redundant, except for the fact that it prescribes the norm of the columns, but this is not essential due to the projective nature of the solutions.\nThe main problem in finding a good relaxation of problem PNC2 is that it is very difficult to enforce the condition X ∈ X . Also, the solutions X are not preserved under arbitrary rotations, but only by very special rotations which leave X invariant (they exchange the axes).\nThe first natural relaxation of problem PNC2 is to drop the condition that X ∈ X , and we obtain the\nProblem (∗2)\n4.3. K-WAY CLUSTERING USING NORMALIZED CUTS 67\nminimize tr(X>LX) subject to X>DX = I,\nX(X>X)−1X>1 = 1.\nActually, since the discrete solutions X ∈ X that we are ultimately seeking are solutions of problem PNC1, the preferred relaxation is the one obtained from problem PNC1 by dropping the condition X ∈ X , and simply requiring that Xj 6= 0, for j = 1, . . . , K: Problem (∗1)\nminimize K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj subject to (X i)>DXj = 0, Xj 6= 0 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j, X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1.\nNow that we dropped the condition X ∈ X , it is not clear that X>X is invertible in (∗1) and (∗2). However, since the columns of X are nonzero and D-orthogonal, they must be linearly independent, so X has rank K and and X>X is invertible.\nAs we explained before, every solution Z = [Z1, . . . , ZK ] of problem (∗1) yields a solution of problem (∗2) by normalizing each Zj by ((Zj)>DZj)1/2, and conversely for every solution Z = [Z1, . . . , ZK ] of problem (∗2), the K-tuple [λ1Z1, . . . , λKZK ] is a solution of problem (∗1), where λj 6= 0 for j = 1, . . . , K. Furthermore, by Proposition 4.1, for every orthogonal matrix R ∈ O(K) and for every solution X of (∗2), the matrix XR is also a solution of (∗2). Since Proposition 4.1(2) requires that all (Xj)>DXj have the same value in order to have µ(X) = µ(XR), in general, if X is a solution of (∗1), the matrix XR is not necessarily a solution of (∗1). However, every solution X of (∗2) is also a solution of (∗1), for every R ∈ O(K), XR is a solution of both (∗2) and (∗1), and since (∗1) is scale-invariant, for every diagonal invertible matrix Λ, the matrix XRΛ is a solution of (∗1).\nIn summary, every solution Z of problem (∗2) yields a family of solutions of problem (∗1); namely, all matrices of the form ZRΛ, where R ∈ O(K) and Λ is a diagonal invertible matrix. We will take advantage of this fact in looking for a discrete solution X “close” to a solution Z of the relaxed problem (∗2).\nObserve that a matrix is of the form RΛ with R ∈ O(K) and Λ a diagonal invertible matrix iff its columns are nonzero and pairwise orthogonal. First, we have\n(RΛ)>RΛ = Λ>R>RΛ = Λ2,\nwhich implies that the columns of RΛ are nonzero and pairwise orthogonal. Conversely, if the columns of A are nonzero and pairwise orthogonal, then\nA>A = Λ2"

For k = n, the manifold St(n, n) is identical to the orthogonal group O(n). For 1 ≤ n ≤ n − 1, the group SO(n) acts transitively on St(k, n), and St(k, n) is isomorphic to the coset manifold SO(n)/SO(n − k). The Grassmann manifold G(k, n) consists of all (linear) k-dimensional subspaces of Rn. Again, the group SO(n) acts transitively on G(k, n), and G(k, n) is isomorphic to the coset manifold SO(n)/S(O(k) ×O(n − k)). The group O(k) acts on the right on the Stiefel manifold St(k, n) (by multiplication), and the orbit manifold St(k, n)/O(k) is isomorphic to the Grassmann manifold G(k, n). Furthermore, both St(k, n) and G(k, n) are naturally reductive homogeneous manifolds (for the Stiefel manifold, when n ≥ 3), and G(k, n) is even a symmetric space (see O’Neill [18]). The upshot of all this is that to a large extent, the differential geometry of these manifolds is completely determined by some subspace m of the Lie algebra so(n), such that we have a direct sum\nso(n) = m⊕ h,\nwhere h = so(n−k) in the case of the Stiefel manifold, and h = so(k)× so(n−k) in the case of the Grassmannian manifold (some additional condition on m is required). In particular, the geodesics in both manifolds can be determined quite explicitly, and thus we obtain closed form formulae for distances, etc.\nThe Stiefel manifold St(k, n) can be viewed as the set of all n× k matrices X such that\nX>X = Ik.\nIn our situation, we are considering N ×K matrices X such that\nX>DX = I.\nThis is not quite the Stiefel manifold, but if we write Y = D1/2X, then we have\nY >Y = I,\nso the space of matrices X satisfying the condition X>DX = I is the image D(St(K,N)) of the Stiefel manifold St(K,N) under the linear map D given by\nD(X) = D1/2X.\nNow, the right action of O(K) on D(St(K,N)) yields a coset manifold D(St(K,N))/O(K) which is obviously isomorphic to the Grassmann manidold G(K,N).\n4.3. K-WAY CLUSTERING USING NORMALIZED CUTS 69\nTherefore, the solutions of problem (∗2) can be viewed as elements of the Grassmannian G(K,N). We can take advantage of this fact to find a discrete solution of our original optimization problem PNC2 approximated by a continuous solution of (∗2).\nRecall that if X>X is invertible (which is the case), condition X(X>X)−1X>1 = 1 is equivalent to XX+1 = 1, which is also equivalent to the fact that 1 is in the range of X. If we make the change of variable Y = D1/2X or equivalently X = D−1/2Y , the condition that 1 is in the range of X becomes the condition that D1/21 is in the range of Y , which is equivalent to\nY Y +D1/21 = D1/21.\nHowever, since Y >Y = I, we have\nY + = Y >,\nso we get the equivalent problem\nProblem (∗∗2)\nminimize tr(Y >D−1/2LD−1/2Y ) subject to Y >Y = I,\nY Y >D1/21 = D1/21.\nThis time, the matrices Y satisfying condition Y >Y = I do belong to the Stiefel manifold St(K,N), and again, we view the solutions of problem (∗∗2) as elements of the Grassmannian G(K,N). We pass from a solution Y of problem (∗∗2) in G(K,N) to a solution Z of of problem (∗2) in G(K,N) by the linear map D−1; namely, Z = D−1(Y ) = D−1/2Y .\nIt is not a priori obvious that the minimum of tr(Y >LsymY ) over all N ×K matrices Y satisfying Y >Y = I is equal to the sum ν1 + · · · + νK of the first K eigenvalues of Lsym = D−1/2LD−1/2. Fortunately, the Poincaré separation theorem (Proposition A.3) guarantees that the sum of the K smallest eigenvalues of Lsym is a lower bound for tr(Y\n>LsymY ). Furthermore, if we temporarily ignore the second constraint, the minimum of problem (∗∗2) is achieved by any K unit eigenvectors (u1, . . . , uK) associated with the smallest eigenvalues\n0 = ν1 ≤ ν2 ≤ . . . ≤ νK\nof Lsym. 1 We may assume that ν2 > 0, namely that the underlying graph is connected (otherwise, we work with each connected component), in which case Y 1 = D1/21/ ∥∥D1/21∥∥\n2 , because 1 is in the nullspace of L. Since Y 1 = D1/21/ ∥∥D1/21∥∥\n2 , the vector D1/21 is in the\nrange of Y , so the condition\nY Y >D1/21 = D1/21\n1Other authors seem to accept this fact as obvious.

Recall that 1 is an eigenvector for the eigenvalue ν1 = 0, and Z1 = 1/ ∥∥D1/21∥∥ 2 .

Also, instead of computing Z>Z explicitly and diagonalizing it, the matrix R can be found by computing an SVD of Z.\nIn summary, we should look for a solution Z of (∗2) that corresponds to an element of the Grassmannian G(K,N), and hope that for some suitable orthogonal matrix R and some diagonal invertible matrix Λ, the vectors in XRΛ are close to a true solution of the original problem.\n4.4 K-Way Clustering; Using The Dependencies\nAmong X1, . . . , XK\nAt this stage, it is interesting to reconsider the case K = 2 in the light of what we just did when K ≥ 3.

Yu [23] and Yu and Shi [24] consider the special case where Q ∈ O(K). We consider the more general case where Q = RΛ, with R ∈ O(K) and Λ is a diagonal invertible matrix.\nThe key to minimizing ‖X − ZQ‖F rests on the following computation:\n‖X − ZQ‖2F = tr((X − ZQ) >(X − ZQ))\n= tr((X> −Q>Z>)(X − ZQ)) = tr(X>X −X>ZQ−Q>Z>X +Q>Z>ZQ) = tr(X>X)− tr(X>ZQ)− tr(Q>Z>X) + tr(Q>Z>ZQ) = tr(X>X)− tr((Q>Z>X)>)− tr(Q>Z>X) + tr(Z>ZQQ>) = ‖X‖2F − 2tr(Q >Z>X) + tr(Z>ZQQ>).\nTherefore, since ‖X‖F = ‖Z‖F is fixed, minimizing ‖X − ZQ‖ 2 F is equivalent to minimizing −2tr(Q>Z>X) + tr(Z>ZQQ>).\nThis is a hard problem because it is a nonlinear optimization problem involving two matrix unknowns X and Q. To simplify the problem, we proceed by alternating steps during which we minimize ϕ(X,Q) = ‖X − ZQ‖F with respect to X holding Q fixed, and steps during which we minimize ϕ(X,Q) = ‖X − ZQ‖F with respect to Q holding X fixed.\nThis second step in which X is held fixed has been studied, but it is still a hard problem for which no closed–form solution is known. Consequently, we further simplify the problem. Since Q is of the form Q = RΛ where R ∈ O(K) and Λ is a diagonal invertible matrix, we minimize ‖X − ZRΛ‖F in two stages.\n1.

For Q = V U>, we get\ntr(QA) = tr(QUΣV >)\n= tr(V U>UΣV >) = tr(V ΣV >) = σ1 + · · ·+ σn,\nwhich proves the second part of the proposition.\nAs a corollary of Proposition 4.3 (with A = Z>X and Q = R>), we get the following result (see Golub and Van Loan [11], Section 12.4.1):\nProposition 4.4. For any two fixed N ×K matrices X and Z, the minimum of the set\n{‖X − ZR‖F | R ∈ O(K)}\nis achieved by R = UV >, for any SVD decomposition UΣV > = Z>X of Z>X.\nThe following proposition takes care of stage 2.\nProposition 4.5.

Without loss of generality, we may assume that the entries a1, . . . , aK occurring in the matrix X are positive and all equal to some common value a 6= 0. Recall that a matrix X ∈ X has the property that every row contains exactly one nonzero entry, and that every column is nonzero.\nTo find X ∈ K, first we find the shape X̂ of X, which is the matrix obtained from X by rescaling the columns of X so that X̂ has entries +1, 0. The problem is to decide for each row, which column contains the nonzero entry. After having found X̂, we rescale its columns so that ‖X‖F = ‖Z‖F .\nSince\n‖X − ZQ‖2F = ‖X‖ 2 F − 2tr(Q >Z>X) + tr(Z>ZQQ>),"

(∗)\nBy (∗), since a > 0, the quantity tr(XY >) is maximized iff yiji is maximized for i = 1, . . . , N ; this is achieved if for the ith row of X, we pick a column index ` such that yi` is maximum.\nTo find the shape X̂ of X, we first find a matrix X by chosing a single nonzero entry xij = 1 on row i in such a way that yij is maximum according to the following method. If we let\nµi = max 1≤j≤K yij Ji = {j ∈ {1, . . . , K} | yij = µi},\nfor i = 1, . . . , N , then\nxij = { +1 for some chosen j ∈ Ji, 0 otherwise.\nOf course, a single column index is chosen for each row. In our implementation, we pick the smallest index in Ji.\nUnfortunately, the matrixX may not be a correct solution, because the above prescription does not guarantee that every column of X is nonzero. When this happens, we reassign certain nonzero entries in columns having “many” nonzero entries to zero columns, so that we get a matrix in K.\nSuppose column j is zero. Then, we pick the leftmost index k of a column with a maximum number of 1, and if i the smallest index for which X ik = 1, then we set X ik = 0 and X ij = 1. We repeat this reallocation scheme until every column is nonzero.\nWe obtain a new matrix X̂ in X , and finally we normalize X̂ to obtain X, so that ‖X‖F = ‖Z‖F .\nA practical way to deal with zero columns in X is to simply decrease K. Clearly, further work is needed to justify the soundness of such a method.\nThe above method is essentially the method described in Yu [23] and Yu and Shi [24], except that in these works (in which X,Z and Y are denoted by X∗, X̃∗, and X̃, respectively) the entries in X belong to {0, 1}; as described above, for row i, the index ` corresponding to the entry +1 is given by\narg max 1≤j≤K X̃(i, j)."

      "text" : "The fact that X may have zero columns is not addressed by Yu. Furthermore, it is important to make sure that X has the same norm as Z, but this normalization step is not performed in the above works. On the other hand, the rows of Z are normalized and the resulting matrix may no longer be a correct solution of the relaxed problem. In practice, it appears to be a good approximation of a discrete solution; see option (3) of the initialization methods for Z described below.\nAny matrix obtained by flipping the signs of some of the columns of a solution ZR of problem (∗2) is still a solution. Moreover, all entries in X are nonnegative. It follows that a “good” solution ZQp (that is, close to a discrete solution) should have the property that the average of each of its column is nonnegative. We found that the following heuristic is quite helpful in finding a better discrete solution X. Given a solution ZR of problem (∗2), we compute ZQp, defined such that if the average of column (ZR)j is negative, then (ZQp)\nj = −(ZR)j, else (ZQp)j = (ZR)j. It follows that the average of every column in ZQp is nonnegative. Then, we apply the above procedure to find discrete solutions X and Xp closest to ZR and ZQp respectively, and we pick the solution corresponding to min{‖X − ZR‖F , ‖Xp − ZQp‖F}. Flipping signs of columns of ZR correspond to a diagonal matrix Rp with entries ±1, a very special kind of orthogonal matrix. In summary, the procedure for finding a discrete X close to a continuous ZR also updates R to Qp = RRp. This step appears to be very effective for finding a good initial X.\nThe method due to Yu and Shi (see Yu [23] and Yu and Shi [24]) to find X ∈ K and Q = RΛ with R ∈ O(K) and Λ diagonal invertible that minimize ϕ(X,Q) = ‖X − ZQ‖F is to alternate steps during which either Q is held fixed (step PODX) or X is held fixed (step PODR), except that Yu and Shi consider the special case where Λ = I.\n(1) In step PODX, the next discrete solution X∗ is obtained fom the previous pair (Q∗, Z)\nby computing X and then X∗ = X̂ from Y = ZQ∗, as just explained above.\n(2) In step PODR, the next matrix Q∗ = RΛ is obtained from the previous pair (X∗, Z) by first computing\nR = UV >,\nfor any SVD decomposition UΣV > of Z>X∗, and then computing Λ from X∗ and ZR using Proposition 4.5. If Λ is singular, then set Λ = I.\nWe keep track of the progress of the procedure by computing ϕ(X∗, Q∗) = ‖X∗ − ZQ∗‖F after every step and checking that X∗ or ϕ(X∗, Q∗) stops changing, whichever comes first. We observed that after a small number of steps, up to machine precision, ϕ(X∗, Q∗) stops decreasing, and when this occurs the procedure halts (we also set a maximum number of steps in case ϕ(X∗, Q∗) decreases for a very long time). Moreover, looking for Q = RΛ where R ∈ O(K) and Λ is obtained using the method of Proposition 4.5 speeds up the convergence and yields a better discrete solution X.\nThe process of searching for X and Q has an illuminating geometric interpretation in terms of graph drawings. We may assume that the entries in the discrete solution X are 0 or"

Every axis contains at least such a point, and the multiplicity of the point along the jth axis is the number of nodes in the jth block of the partition. Similarly, the rows of Z are the nodes of a graph drawing of the weighted graph (V,W ). Multiplying Z on the right by a K × K matrix Q (obtaining ZQ) is equivalent to multiplying Z> on the left by Q> (obtaining Q>Z>). This means that the points in RK representing the rows of ZQ are obtained by applying the linear transformation Q> to the columns of Z>. Thus, ZR amounts to applying the rigid motion R> to the graph drawing Z, and ZΛ (where Λ is a diagonal invertible matrix) amounts to stretching or shrinking the graph drawing Z in the directions of the axes.\nThen, in step 2 (PODR), we are trying to deform the graph drawing given by Z using a linear map (RΛ)>, so that the deformed graph drawing ZRΛ is as close as possible to X (in the sense that ‖X − ZRΛ‖F is minimized).\nIn step 1 (PODX), we are trying to approximate the deformed graph drawing ZRΛ by a discrete graph drawingX (whose nodes are the tips of the unit vectors), so that ‖X − ZRΛ‖F is minimized.\nIf we are willing to give up the requirement that the deformed Z is still a solution of problem (∗1), we have quite a bit of freedom in step 2. For example, we may allow normalizing the rows. This seems reasonable to obtain an initial transformation Q. However, we feel uncomfortable in allowing intermediate deformed Z that are not solutions of (∗1) during the iteration process. This point should be investigated further.\nIn some sense, we have less freedom in step 1, since the ith row of ZRΛ is assigned to the jth unit vector iff the index of the leftmost largest coordinate of this row is j. If some axis has not been assigned any row of R, then we reallocate one of the points on an axis with a maximum number of points.\nFigure 4.5 shows a graph (on the left) and the graph drawings X and Z ∗ R obtained by applying our method for three clusters. The rows of X are represented by the red points along the axes, and the rows of Z ∗R by the green points (on the right). The original vertices corresponding to the rows of Z are represented in blue. We can see how the two red points correspond to an edge, the three red points correspond to a triangle, and the four red points to a quadrangle. These constitute the clusters.\nIt remains to initialize Q∗ to start the process, and then steps (1) and (2) are iterated, starting with step (1). Actually, what we really need is a “good” initial X∗, but to find it, we need an initial R∗.\nMethod 1. One method is to use an orthogonal matrix denoted R1, such that distinct columns of ZR1 are simultaneously orthogonal and D-orthogonal. The matrix R1 can be found by diagonalizing Z>Z as Z>Z = R1ΣR > 1 , as we explained at the end of Section 4.3. We write Z2 = ZR1.\nMethod 2. The method advocated by Yu [23] is to pick K rows of Z that are as orthogonal to each other as possible and to make a matrix R whose columns consist of these rows"

The intuition behind this method is that if a continuous solution Z can be sent close to a discrete solution X by a rigid motion, then many rows of Z viewed as vectors in RK should be nearly orthogonal. This way, ZR should contain at least K rows well aligned with the canonical basis vectors, and these rows are good candidates for some of the rows of the discrete solution X.\nThe algorithm given in Yu [23] needs a small correction, because rows are not removed from Z when they are added to R, which may cause the same row to be added several times to R.\nGiven the N × K matrix Z (whose columns all have the same norm), we compute a matrix R whose columns are certain rows of Z. We use a vector c ∈ RN to keep track of the inner products of all rows of Z with the columns R1, . . . , Rk−1 that have been constructed so far, and initially when k = 1, we set c = 0.\nThe first column R1 of R is any chosen row of Z.\nNext, for k = 2, . . . , K, we compute all the inner products of Rk−1 with all rows in Z, which are recorded in the vector ZRk−1, and we update c as follows:\nc = c+ abs(ZRk−1).\nWe take the absolute values of the entries in ZRk−1 so that the ith entry in c is a score of how orthogonal is the ith row of Z to R1, . . . , Rk−1. Then, we choose Rk as any row Zi of Z for which ci is minimal (the customary (and ambiguous) i = arg min c), and we delete this row from Z. The process is repeated (with the updated Z) until k = K."

We have implemented three methods.\n1. We attempt to rescale the columns of Z by some diagonal invertible matrix Λ = diag(λ1, . . . , λK), so that the rows of ZΛ sum to 1 as much as possible in the leastsquares sense. Since the vector of sums of rows of ZΛ is ZΛ1K = Zλ, with λ\n> = (λ1, . . . , λK), the least-squares problem is to minimize\n‖Zλ− 1N‖22 ,\nand since Z has rank K, the solution is λ = (Z>Z)−1Z>1N , and thus,\nΛ = diag((Z>Z)−1Z>1N).\nThe matrix Λ is singular if some of the columns of Z sum to 0. This happens for regular graphs, where the degree matrix is a multiple of the identity. There are also cases where some of the λj are very small, so we use a tolerance factor to prevent this, and in case of failure, we set Λ = I.

The matrix Z ◦ Z may not have rank K, so the leastsquares solution for λ2 is given by the pseudo-inverse of Z ◦ Z, as\nλ2 = (Z ◦ Z)+1N .\nThere is no guarantee that the vector on the right-hand side has all positive entries, so the method may fail.

Unlike the methods used in (1) and (2), this method does not guarantee that NZ ∗ Z is a solution of problem (∗1). However, since the rows of Z can be interpreted as vectors in RK that should align as much as possible with the canonical basis vectors of RK , this method makes sense as a way to come closer to a discrete solution. In fact, we found that it does well in most cases.\nWe implemented a computer program that prompts the user for various options. To avoid confusion, let us denote the original solution of problem (∗2) by Z1, and let Z2 = Z1R1, as obtained by initialization method 1. The four options are:\n1. Use the original solution Z1 of problem (∗2), as well as Z2.\n2. Apply method 1 to Z1 and Z2.\n3. Apply method 2 to Z1 and Z2.\n4.

From our perspective, we would like to know whether clustering using normalized cuts can be extended to signed graphs.\nGiven a signed graph G = (V,W ) (where W is a symmetric matrix with zero diagonal entries), the underlying graph of G is the graph with node set V and set of (undirected) edges E = {{vi, vj} | wij 6= 0}.\nThe first obstacle is that the degree matrix may now contain zero or negative entries. As a consequence, the Laplacian L may no longer be positive semidefinite, and worse, D−1/2 may not exist.\nA simple remedy is to use the absolute values of the weights in the degree matrix! This idea applied to signed graph with weights (−1, 0, 1) occurs in Hou [14]. Kolluri, Shewchuk and O’Brien [15] take the natural step of using absolute values of weights in the degree matrix in their original work on surface reconstruction from noisy point clouds. Given a Delaunay tetrahedralization, they build a graph with positive and negative edges and use the normalized cut method for two clusters to decide which tetrahedra are inside or outside the original object. The triangulated surface (called the eigencrust) consists of the triangles where an inside and an outside tetrahedron meet. The authors state that the Lapacians arising from such graphs are always positive definite, which is not quite correct since this is only true for unbalanced graphs (see Section 5.3). Kunegis et al.

Therefore, this is the same problem as in Chapter 4, with L replaced by L and D replaced by D.\nObserve that minimizing sNcut(A1, . . . , AK) amounts to minimizing the number of positive and negative edges between clusters, and also minimizing the number of negative edges within clusters. This second minimization captures the intuition that nodes connected by a negative edge should not be together (they do not “like” each other; they should be far from each other).\nThe K-clustering problem for signed graphs is related but not equivalent to another problem known as correlation clustering . In correlation clustering, in our terminology and notation, given a graph G = (V,W ) with positively and negatively weighted edges, one seeks a clustering of V that minimizes the sum links−(Aj, Aj) of the absolute values of the negative weights of the edges within each cluster Aj, and minimizes the sum links\n+(Aj, Aj) of the positive weights of the edges between distinct clusters. In contrast to K-clustering, the number K of clusters is not given in advance, and there is no normalization with respect to size of volume. Furthermore, in correlation clustering, only the contribution links+(Aj, Aj) of positively weighted edges is minimized, but our method only allows us to minimize cut(Aj, Aj), which also takes into account negatively weighted edges between distinct clusters. Correlation clustering was first introduced and studied for complete graphs by Bansal, Blum and Chawla [1]. They prove that this problem is NP-complete and give several approximation algorithms, including a PTAS for maximizing agreement. Demaine and Immorlica [5] consider the same problem for arbitrary weighted graphs, and they give an O(log n)-approximation algorithm based on linear programming. Since correlation clustering does not assume that K is given and not not include nomalization by size or volume, it is not clear whether algorithms for correlation clustering can be applied to normalized K-clustering, and conversely."

[16], it is also possible to characterize for which signed graphs the Laplacian L is positive definite. Such graphs are “cousins” of bipartite graphs and were introduced by Harary [12]. Since a graph is the union of its connected components, we restrict ourselves to connected graphs.\nDefinition 5.3. Given a signed graph G = (V,W ) with negative weights whose underlying graph is connected, we say that G is balanced if there is a partition of its set of nodes V into two blocks V1 and V2 such that all positive edges connect nodes within V1 or V2, and negative edges connect nodes between V1 and V2.\nAn example of a balanced graph is shown in Figure 5.1 on the left, in which positive edges are colored green and negative edges are colored red. This graph admits the partition\n({v1, v2, v4, v7, v8}, {v3, v5, v6, v9}).\nOn the other hand, the graph shown on the right contains the cycle (v2, v3, v6, v5, v4, v2) with an odd number of negative edges (3), and thus is not balanced.\nObserve that if we delete all positive edges in a balanced graph, then the resulting graph is bipartite. Then, it is not surprising that connected balanced graphs can be characterized as signed graphs in which every cycle has an even number of negative edges. This is analogous to the characterization of a connected bipartite graph as a graph in which every cycle has even length. The following proposition was first proved by Harary [12]. We give a more direct proof.\nProposition 5.4. If G = (V,W ) is a connected signed graph with negative weights, then G is balanced iff every cycle contains an even number of negative edges.\nProof. If G is balanced, then every cycle must switch from a node in V1 to a node in V2 (or from a node in V2 to a node in V1) an even number of times. Therefore, it contains an even number of negative edges."

Since G is connected, pick some some v0 in V , and let V1 be the set of node reachable from v0 by a path with an odd number of negative edges, and let V2 be the set of node reachable from v0 by a path with an even number of negative edges. Clearly, (V1, V2) is a partition of V . Assume that there is a negative edge {u, v} between two nodes within V1 (or V2). Then, using the paths from v0 to u and v, where the parity of the number of negative edges is the same, we would obtain a cycle with an odd number of negative edges, a contradiction. Therefore, edges between nodes in V1 (or V2) are positive, and negative edges connect nodes in V1 and V2.\nWe can also detect whether a connected signed graph is balanced in terms of the kernel of the transpose of any of its incidence matrices.\nProposition 5.5. If G = (V,W ) is a connected signed graph with negative weights and with m nodes, for any orientation of its underlying graph, let B be the corresponding incidence matrix. The underlying graph of G is balanced iff rank(B) = m − 1. Furthermore, if G is balanced, then there is a vector u with ui ∈ {−1, 1} such that B>u = 0, and the sets of nodes V1 = {vi | ui = −1} and V2 = {vi | ui = +1} form a partition of V for which G is balanced.\nProof. Assume that rank(B) = m− 1; this implies that Ker (B>) 6= (0). For any u 6= 0, we have B>u = 0 iff u>B = 0 iff u is orthogonal to every column of B. By definition of B, we have\nui = sgn(wij)uj\niff there is an edge between vi and vj.\nPick node v1 in V and define V1 and V2 as in the proof of Proposition 5.4. The above equation shows that u has the same value on nodes connected by a path with an even number of negative edges, and opposite values on nodes connected by a path with an odd number of negative edges. Since V1 consists of all nodes connected to v1 by a path with an odd number of negative edges and V2 consists of all nodes connected to v1 by a path with an even number of negative edges, it follows that u has the same value c = u1 on all nodes in V1, and the value −c on all nodes in V2. Then, there is no negative edge between any two nodes in V1 (or V2), since otherwise u would take opposite values on theses two nodes, contrary to the fact that u has a constant value on V1 (and V2). This implies that (V1, V2) is a partition of V making G a balanced graph.\nConversely, if G is balanced, then there is a partition (V1, V2) of V such that positive edges connect nodes within V1 or V2, and negative edges connect nodes between V1 and V2. Then, if u is the vector with ui ∈ {−1, 1} defined so that ui = +1 iff vi ∈ V1 and ui = −1 iff vi ∈ V2, we have\nui = sgn(wij)uj,\nand so B>u = 0, which shows that u ∈ Ker (B>).

Thus, P is indeed orthogonal.\n5.4 K-Way Clustering of Signed Graphs\nUsing the signed Laplacians L and Lsym, we can define the optimization problems as in Section 4.3 and solve them as in Section 4.5, except that we drop the constraint\nX(X>X)−1X>1 = 1,\nsince 1 is not necessarily an eigenvector of L.

The m × n matrix R consisting of any unit eigenvectors u2, . . . , un+1 associated with λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λn+1 yields an orthogonal nonbipartite graph drawing of minimal energy.\n(3) If G is balanced, for n = 2, a graph drawing of G as a bipartite graph (with positive edges only withing the two blocks of vertices) is obtained from the m× 2 matrix consisting of any two unit eigenvectors u1 and u2 associated with 0 and λ2.\nIn all cases, the graph drawing R satisfies the condition R>R = I (it is an orthogonal graph drawing).\nOur first example is the signed graph G4 defined by the weight matrix given by the following Matlab program:\nnn = 6; G3 = diag(ones(1,nn),1); G3 = G3 + G3’; G3(1,nn+1) = 1; G3(nn+1,1) = 1; G4 = -G3;\nAll edges of this graph are negative.

The graph obtained by using absolute values in G1 is shown on the left and the bipartite graph obtained by using the signed Laplacian of G1 is shown on the right in Figure 5.10.\nChapter 6\nGraph Clustering Using Ratio Cuts\nIn this short chapter, we consider the alternative to normalized cut, called ratio cut, and show that the methods of Chapters 4 and 5 can be trivially adapted to solve the clustering problem using ratio cuts. All that needs to be done is to replace the normalized Laplacian Lsym by the unormalized Laplacian L, and omit the step of considering Problem (∗∗2). In particular, there is no need to multiply the continuous solution Y by D−1/2. The idea of ratio cut is to replace the volume vol(Aj) of each block Aj of the partition by its size, |Aj| (the number of nodes in Aj). First, we deal with unsigned graphs, the case where the entries in the symmetric weight matrix W are nonnegative.\nDefinition 6.1. The ratio cut Rcut(A1, . . . , AK) of the partition (A1, . . . , AK) is defined as\nRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) |Aj| .\nAs in Section 4.3, given a partition of V into K clusters (A1, . . . , AK), if we represent the jth block of this partition by a vector Xj such that\nXji = { aj if vi ∈ Aj 0 if vi /∈ Aj,\nfor some aj 6= 0, then\n(Xj)>LXj = a2j(cut(Aj, Aj)\n(Xj)>Xj = a2j |Aj|.\nConsequently, we have\nRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) |Aj| = K∑ i=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>Xj .\n103\n104 CHAPTER 6. GRAPH CLUSTERING USING RATIO CUTS\nOn the other hand, the normalized cut is given by\nNcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ i=1 cut(Aj, Aj) vol(Aj) = K∑ i=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>DXj .\nTherefore, ratio cut is the special case of normalized cut where D = I. If we let X = {\n[X1 . . . XK ] | Xj = aj(xj1, . . . , x j N), x j i ∈ {1, 0}, aj ∈ R, Xj 6= 0 } (note that the condition Xj 6= 0 implies that aj 6= 0), then the set of matrices representing partitions of V into K blocks is\nK = { X = [X1 · · · XK ] | X ∈ X ,\n(X i)>Xj = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j } .\nHere is our first formulation of K-way clustering of a graph using ratio cuts, called problem PRC1 :\nK-way Clustering of a graph using Ratio Cut, Version 1: Problem PRC1\nminimize K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>Xj subject to (X i)>Xj = 0, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ K, i 6= j, X ∈ X .\nThe solutions that we are seeking are K-tuples (P(X1), . . . ,P(XK)) of points in RPN−1 determined by their homogeneous coordinates X1, . . . , XK . As in Chapter 4, chasing denominators and introducing a trace, we obtain the following formulation of our minimization problem:\nK-way Clustering of a graph using Ratio Cut, Version 2: Problem PRC2\nminimize tr(X>LX) subject to X>X = I,\nX ∈ X .\nThe natural relaxation of problem PRC2 is to drop the condition that X ∈ X , and we obtain the\n105\nProblem (R∗2)\nminimize tr(X>LX) subject to X>X = I.\nThis time, since the normalization condition is X>X = I, we can use the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of L, and by Proposition A.2, the minimum is achieved by any K unit eigenvectors (u1, . . . , uK) associated with the smallest K eigenvalues\n0 = λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λK\nof L. The matrix Z = Y = [u1, . . . , uK ] yields a minimum of our relaxed problem (R∗2). The rest of the algorithm is as before; we try to find Q = RΛ with R ∈ O(K), Λ diagonal invertible, and X ∈ X such that ‖X − ZQ‖ is minimum.\nIn the case of signed graphs, we define the signed ratio cut sRcut(A1, . . . , AK) of the partition (A1, . . . , AK) as\nsRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 cut(Aj, Aj) |Aj| + 2 K∑ j=1 links−(Aj, Aj) |Aj| .\nSince we still have\n(Xj)>LXj = a2j(cut(Aj, Aj) + 2links −(Aj, Aj)),\nwe obtain\nsRcut(A1, . . . , AK) = K∑ j=1 (Xj)>LXj (Xj)>Xj .\nTherefore, this is similar to the case of unsigned graphs, with L replaced with L. The same algorithm applies, but as in Chapter 5, the signed Laplacian L is positive definite iff G is unbalanced. Modifying the computer program implementing normalized cuts to deal with ratio cuts is trivial (use L instead of Lsym and don’t multiply Y by D −1/2\n). Generally, normalized cut seems to yield “better clusters,” but this is not a very satisfactory statement since we haven’t defined precisely in which sense a clustering is better than another. We leave this point as further research.\n106 CHAPTER 6. GRAPH CLUSTERING USING RATIO CUTS"

      "text" : "Rayleigh Ratios and the Courant-Fischer Theorem\nThe most important property of symmetric matrices is that they have real eigenvalues and that they can be diagonalized with respect to an orthogonal matrix. Thus, if A is an n× n symmetric matrix, then it has n real eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λn (not necessarily distinct), and there is an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors (u1, . . . , un) (for a proof, see Gallier [8]). Another fact that is used frequently in optimization problem is that the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are characterized in terms of what is known as the Rayleigh ratio, defined by\nR(A)(x) = x>Ax\nx>x , x ∈ Rn, x 6= 0.\nThe following proposition is often used to prove the correctness of various optimization or approximation problems (for example PCA).\nProposition A.1. (Rayleigh–Ritz) If A is a symmetric n× n matrix with eigenvalues λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn and if (u1, . . . , un) is any orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of A, where ui is a unit eigenvector associated with λi, then\nmax x 6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x = λn\n(with the maximum attained for x = un), and\nmax x 6=0,x∈{un−k+1,...,un}⊥\nx>Ax\nx>x = λn−k\n(with the maximum attained for x = un−k), where 1 ≤ k ≤ n− 1. Equivalently, if Vk is the subspace spanned by (u1, . . . , uk), then\nλk = max x 6=0,x∈Vk\nx>Ax\nx>x , k = 1, . . . , n.\n107\n108 APPENDIX A. RAYLEIGH RATIOS AND THE COURANT-FISCHER THEOREM\nProof. First, observe that\nmax x 6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x = max x {x>Ax | x>x = 1},\nand similarly,\nmax x 6=0,x∈{un−k+1,...,un}⊥\nx>Ax\nx>x = max x\n{ x>Ax | (x ∈ {un−k+1, . . . , un}⊥) ∧ (x>x = 1) } .\nSince A is a symmetric matrix, its eigenvalues are real and it can be diagonalized with respect to an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors, so let (u1, . . . , un) be such a basis. If we write\nx = n∑ i=1 xiui,\na simple computation shows that\nx>Ax = n∑ i=1 λix 2 i .\nIf x>x = 1, then ∑n\ni=1 x 2 i = 1, and since we assumed that λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn, we get\nx>Ax = n∑ i=1 λix 2 i ≤ λn ( n∑ i=1 x2i ) = λn.\nThus, max x\n{ x>Ax | x>x = 1 } ≤ λn,\nand since this maximum is achieved for en = (0, 0, . . . , 1), we conclude that\nmax x\n{ x>Ax | x>x = 1 } = λn.\nNext, observe that x ∈ {un−k+1, . . . , un}⊥ and x>x = 1 iff xn−k+1 = · · · = xn = 0 and∑n−k i=1 x 2 i = 1. Consequently, for such an x, we have\nx>Ax = n−k∑ i=1 λix 2 i ≤ λn−k ( n∑ i=k+1 x2i ) = λn−k.\nThus, max x { x>Ax | (x ∈ {un−k+1, . . . , un}⊥) ∧ (x>x = 1) } ≤ λn−k,\nand since this maximum is achieved for en−k = (0, . . . , 0, 1, 0, . . . , 0) with a 1 in position n− k, we conclude that\nmax x\n{ x>Ax | (x ∈ {un−k+1, . . . , un}⊥) ∧ (x>x = 1) } = λn−k,\nas claimed.\n109\nFor our purposes, we also need the version of Proposition A.1 applying to min instead of max, whose proof is obtained by a trivial modification of the proof of Proposition A.1.\nProposition A.2. (Rayleigh–Ritz) If A is a symmetric n× n matrix with eigenvalues λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn and if (u1, . . . , un) is any orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of A, where ui is a unit eigenvector associated with λi, then\nmin x 6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x = λ1\n(with the minimum attained for x = u1), and\nmin x 6=0,x∈{u1,...,ui−1}⊥\nx>Ax\nx>x = λi\n(with the minimum attained for x = ui), where 2 ≤ i ≤ n. Equivalently, if Wk = V ⊥k−1 denotes the subspace spanned by (uk, . . . , un) (with V0 = (0)), then\nλk = min x 6=0,x∈Wk\nx>Ax\nx>x = min\nx 6=0,x∈V ⊥k−1\nx>Ax\nx>x , k = 1, . . . , n.\nPropositions A.1 and A.2 together are known as the Rayleigh–Ritz theorem.\nAs an application of Propositions A.1 and A.2, we give a proof of a proposition which is the key to the proof of Theorem 3.2. First, we need a definition. Given an n× n symmetric matrix A and an m×m symmetric B, with m ≤ n, if λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn are the eigenvalues of A and µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · ≤ µm are the eigenvalues of B, then we say that the eigenvalues of B interlace the eigenvalues of A if\nλi ≤ µi ≤ λn−m+i, i = 1, . . . ,m.\nThe following proposition is known as the Poincaré separation theorem; see Horn and Johnson [13], Section 4.3, Corollary 4.3.16.\nProposition A.3. Let A be an n × n symmetric matrix, R be an n ×m matrix such that R>R = I (with m ≤ n), and let B = R>AR (an m ×m matrix). The following properties hold:\n(a) The eigenvalues of B interlace the eigenvalues of A.\n(b) If λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn are the eigenvalues of A and µ1 ≤ µ2 ≤ · · · ≤ µm are the eigenvalues of B, and if λi = µi, then there is an eigenvector v of B with eigenvalue µi such that Rv is an eigenvector of A with eigenvalue λi.\n110 APPENDIX A. RAYLEIGH RATIOS AND THE COURANT-FISCHER THEOREM\nProof. (a) Let (u1, . . . , un) be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for A, and let (v1, . . . , vm) be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for B. Let Uj be the subspace spanned by (u1, . . . , uj) and let Vj be the subspace spanned by (v1, . . . , vj). For any i, the subpace Vi has dimension i and the subspace R>Ui−1 has dimension at most i − 1. Therefore, there is some nonzero vector v ∈ Vi ∩ (R>Ui−1)⊥, and since\nv>R>uj = (Rv) >uj = 0, j = 1, . . . , i− 1,\nwe have Rv ∈ (Ui−1)⊥. By Proposition A.2 and using the fact that R>R = I, we have\nλi ≤ (Rv)>ARv (Rv)>Rv = v>Bv v>v .\nOn the other hand, by Proposition A.1,\nµi = max x 6=0,x∈{vi+1,...,vn}⊥\nx>Bx\nx>x = max x 6=0,x∈{v1,...,vi}\nx>Bx\nx>x ,\nso w>Bw\nw>w ≤ µi for all w ∈ Vi,\nand since v ∈ Vi, we have\nλi ≤ v>Bv\nv>v ≤ µi, i = 1, . . . ,m.\nWe can apply the same argument to the symmetric matrices −A and −B, to conclude that\n−λn−m+i ≤ −µi,\nthat is, µi ≤ λn−m+i, i = 1, . . . ,m.\nTherefore, λi ≤ µi ≤ λn−m+i, i = 1, . . . ,m,\nas desired.\n(b) If λi = µi, then\nλi = (Rv)>ARv (Rv)>Rv = v>Bv v>v = µi,\nso v must be an eigenvector for B and Rv must be an eigenvector for A, both for the eigenvalue λi = µi.\nObserve that Proposition A.3 implies that\nλ1 + · · ·+ λm ≤ tr(R>AR) ≤ λn−m+1 + · · ·+ λn.\nThe left inequality is used to prove Theorem 3.2.\nFor the sake of completeness, we also prove the Courant–Fischer characterization of the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.\n111\nTheorem A.4. (Courant–Fischer) Let A be a symmetric n × n matrix with eigenvalues λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ · · · ≤ λn and let (u1, . . . , un) be any orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of A, where ui is a unit eigenvector associated with λi. If Vk denotes the set of subspaces of Rn of dimension k, then\nλk = max W∈Vn−k+1 min x∈W,x6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x\nλk = min W∈Vk max x∈W,x6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x .\nProof. Let us consider the second equality, the proof of the first equality being similar. Observe that the space Vk spanned by (u1, . . . , uk) has dimension k, and by Proposition A.1, we have\nλk = max x 6=0,x∈Vk\nx>Ax\nx>x ≥ min W∈Vk max x∈W,x6=0\nx>Ax\nx>x .\nTherefore, we need to prove the reverse inequality; that is, we have to show that\nλk ≤ max x 6=0,x∈W\nx>Ax\nx>x , for all W ∈ Vk.\nNow, for any W ∈ Vk, if we can prove that W∩V ⊥k−1 6= (0), then for any nonzero v ∈ W∩V ⊥k−1, by Proposition A.2 , we have\nλk = min x 6=0,x∈V ⊥k−1\nx>Ax\nx>x ≤ v\n>Av v>v ≤ max x∈W,x6=0 x>Ax x>x .\nIt remains to prove that dim(W ∩ V ⊥k−1) ≥ 1. However, dim(Vk−1) = k − 1, so dim(V ⊥k−1) = n− k + 1, and by hypothesis dim(W ) = k. By the Grassmann relation,\ndim(W ) + dim(V ⊥k−1) = dim(W ∩ V ⊥k−1) + dim(W + V ⊥k−1),\nand since dim(W + V ⊥k−1) ≤ dim(Rn) = n, we get\nk + n− k + 1 ≤ dim(W ∩ V ⊥k−1) + n;\nthat is, 1 ≤ dim(W ∩ V ⊥k−1), as claimed.\n112 APPENDIX A.

      "text" : "Riemannian Metrics on Quotient Manifolds\nIn order to define a metric on the projective space RPn, we need to review a few notions of differential geometry. First, we need to define the quotient M/G of a manifold by a group acting on M . This section relies heavily on Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine [9] and Lee [17], which contain thorough expositions and should be consulted for details.\nDefinition B.1. Recall that an action of a group G (with identity element 1) on a set X is a map γ : G×X → X satisfying the following properties:\n(1) γ(1, x) = x, for all x ∈ X.\n(2) γ(g1, γ(g2, x)) = γ(g1g2, x), for all g1, g2 ∈ G, and all x ∈ X.\nWe usually abbreviate γ(g, x) by g · x. If X is a topological space and G is a topological group, we say that the action is continuous iff the map γ is continuous. In this case, for every g ∈ G, the map x 7→ g · x is a homeomorphism. If X is a smooth manifold and G is a Lie group, we say that the action is smooth iff the map γ is smooth. In this case, for every g ∈ G, the map x 7→ g · x is a diffeomorphism.\nRemark: To be more precise, what we have defined in Definition B.1 is a left action of the group G on the set X. There is also a notion of a right action, but we won’t need it.\nThe quotient of X by G, denoted X/G, is the set of orbits of G; that is, the set of equivalences classes of the equivalence relation ' defined such that, for any x, y ∈ X,\nx ' y iff (∃g ∈ G)(y = g · x).\nThe orbit of x ∈ X (the equivalence class of x) is the set\nO(x) = {g · x | g ∈ G},\n113\n114 APPENDIX B. RIEMANNIAN METRICS ON QUOTIENT MANIFOLDS\nalso denoted by G · x. If X is a topological space, we give X/G the quotient topology. For any subset V of X and for any g ∈ G, we denote by gV the set\ngV = {g · x | x ∈ V }.\nOne problem is that even if X is Hausdorff, X/G may not be. Thus, we need to find conditions to ensure that X/G is Hausdorff.\nBy a discrete group, we mean a group equipped with the discrete topology (every subset is open). In other words, we don’t care about the topology of G! The following conditions prove to be useful.\nDefinition B.2. Let · : G×X → X be the action of a group G on a set X. We say that G acts freely (or that the action is free) iff for all g ∈ G and all x ∈ X, if g 6= 1 then g · x 6= x.\nIf X is a locally compact space and G is a discrete group acting continuously on X, we say that G acts properly (or that the action is proper) iff\n(i) For every x ∈ X, there is some open subset V with x ∈ V such that gV ∩ V 6= ∅ for only finitely many g ∈ G.\n(ii) For all x, y ∈ X, if y /∈ G · x (y is not in the orbit of x), then there exist some open sets V,W with x ∈ V and y ∈ W such that gV ∩W = 0 for all g ∈ G.\nThe following proposition gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a discrete group to act freely and properly often found in the literature (for instance, O’Neill [18], Berger and Gostiaux [3], and do Carmo [6], but beware that in this last reference Hausdorff separation is not required!).\nProposition B.1. If X is a locally compact space and G is a discrete group, then a smooth action of G on M is free and proper iff the following conditions hold:\n(i) For every x ∈ X, there is some open subset V with x ∈ V such that gV ∩ V = ∅ for all g ∈ G such that g 6= 1.\n(ii) For all x, y ∈ X, if y /∈ G · x (y is not in the orbit of x), then there exist some open sets V,W with x ∈ V and y ∈ W such that gV ∩W = 0 for all g ∈ G.\nProof. Condition (i) of Proposition B.1 implies condition (i) of Definition B.2, and condition (ii) is the same in Proposition B.1 and Definition B.2. If (i) holds, then the action must be free since if g · x = x, then gV ∩ V 6= ∅, which implies that g = 1.\nConversely, we just have to prove that the conditions of Definition B.2 imply condition (i) of Proposition B.1. By (i) of Definition B.2, there is some open subset U containing x and a finite number of elements of G, say g1, . . . , gm, with gi 6= 1, such that\ngiU ∩ U 6= ∅, i = 1, . . . ,m.\n115\nSince our action is free and gi 6= 1, we have gi ·x 6= x, so by Hausdorff separation, there exist some open subsets Wi,W ′ i , with x ∈ Wi and gi ·x ∈ W ′i , such that Wi∩W ′i = ∅, i = 1, . . . ,m. Then, if we let\nV = W ∩ ( m⋂ i=1 (Wi ∩ g−1i W ′i ) ) ,\nwe see that V ∩ giV = ∅, and since V ⊆ W , we also have V ∩ gV = ∅ for all other g ∈ G.\nRemark: The action of a discrete group satisfying the properties of Proposition B.1 is often called “properly discontinuous.” However, as pointed out by Lee ([17], just before Proposition 9.18), this term is self-contradictory since such actions are smooth, and thus continuous!\nWe also need covering maps.\nDefinition B.3. Let X and Y be two topological spaces. A map π : X → Y is a covering map iff the following conditions hold:\n(1) The map π is continuous and surjective.\n(2) For every y ∈ Y , there is some open subset W ⊆ Y with y ∈ W , such that π−1(W ) = ⋃ i∈I Ui,\nwhere the Ui ⊆ X are pairwise disjoint open subsets such that the restriction of π to Ui is a homeomorphism for every i ∈ I.\nIf X and Y are smooth manifolds, we assume that π is smooth and that the restriction of π to each Ui is a diffeomorphism.\nThen, we have the following useful result.\nTheorem B.2. Let M be a smooth manifold and let G be discrete group acting smoothly, freely and properly on M . Then there is a unique structure of smooth manifold on M/G such that the projection map π : M →M/G is a covering map.\nFor a proof, see Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine [9] (Theorem 1.88) or Lee [17] (Theorem 9.19).\nReal projective spaces are illustrations of Theorem B.2. Indeed, if M is the unit nsphere Sn ⊆ Rn+1 and G = {I,−I}, where −I is the antipodal map, then the conditions of Proposition B.1 are easily checked (since Sn is compact), and consequently the quotient\nRPn = Sn/G\nis a smooth manifold and the projection map π : Sn → RPn is a covering map. The fiber π−1([x]) of every point [x] ∈ RPn consists of two antipodal points: x,−x ∈ Sn.\nThe next step is see how a Riemannian metric on M induces a Riemannian metric on the quotient manifold M/G.\n116 APPENDIX B. RIEMANNIAN METRICS ON QUOTIENT MANIFOLDS\nDefinition B.4. Given any two Riemmanian manifolds (M, g) and (N, h) a smooth map f : M → N is a local isometry iff for all p ∈ M , the tangent map dfp : TpM → Tf(p)N is an orthogonal transformation of the Euclidean spaces (TpM, gp) and (Tf(p)N, hf(p))). Furthermore, if f is a diffeomorphism, we say that f is an isometry .\nThe Riemannian version of a covering map is the following:\nDefinition B.5. Let (M, g) and (N, h) be two Riemannian manifolds. A map π : M → N is a Riemannian covering map iff the following conditions hold:\n(1) The map π is a smooth covering.\n(2) The map π is a local isometry.\nThe following theorem is the Riemannian version of Theorem B.2.\nTheorem B.3. Let (M,h) be a Riemannian manifold and let G be discrete group acting smoothly, freely and properly on M , and such that the map x 7→ σ · x is an isometry for all σ ∈ G. Then there is a unique structure of Riemannian manifold on N = M/G such that the projection map π : M →M/G is a Riemannian covering map.\nProof sketch. For a complete proof see Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine [9] (Proposition 2.20). To define a Riemannian metric g on N = M/G we need to define an inner product gp on the tangent space TpN for every p ∈ N . Pick any q1 ∈ π−1(p) in the fibre of p. Because π is a Riemannian covering map, it is a local diffeomorphism, and thus dπq1 : Tq1M → TpM is an isometry. Then, given any two tangent vectors u, v ∈ TpN , we define their inner product gp(u, v) by\ngp(u, v) = hq1(dπ −1 q1 (u), dπ−1q1 (v)).\nNow, we need to show that gp does not depend on the choice of q1 ∈ π−1(p). So, let q2 ∈ π−1(p) be any other point in the fibre of p. By definition of N = M/G, we have q2 = g · q1 for some g ∈ G, and we know that the map f : q 7→ g · q is an isometry of M . Now, since π = π ◦ f we have\ndπq1 = dπq2 ◦ dfq1 ,\nand since dπq1 : Tq1M → TpM and dπq2 : Tq2M → TpM are isometries, we get\ndπ−1q2 = dfq1 ◦ dπ −1 q1 .\nBut dfq1 : Tq1M → Tq2M is also an isometry, so\nhq2(dπ −1 q2 (u), dπ−1q2 (v)) = hq2(dfq1(dπ −1 q1 (u)), dfq1(dπ −1 q2 (v))) = hq1(dπ −1 q1 (u), dπ−1q1 (v)).\nTherefore, the inner product gp is well defined on TpN .\n117\nTheorem B.3 implies that every Riemannian metric g on the sphere Sn induces a Riemannian metric ĝ on the projective space RPn, in such a way that the projection π : Sn → RPn is a Riemannian covering. In particular, if U is an open hemisphere obtained by removing its boundary Sn−1 from a closed hemisphere, then π is an isometry between U and its image RPn − π(Sn−1) ≈ RPn − RPn−1.\nWe also observe that for any two points p = [x] and q = [y] in RPn, where x, y ∈ Sn, if x · y = cos θ, with 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, then there are two possibilities:\n1. x · y ≥ 0, which means that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, or\n2. x · y < 0, which means that π/2 < θ ≤ π.\nIn the second case, since [−y] = [y] and x · (−y) = −x ·y, we can replace the representative y of q by −y, and we have x · (−y) = cos(π− θ), with 0 ≤ π− θ < π/2. Therefore, in all cases, for any two points p, q ∈ RPn, we can find an open hemisphere U such that p = [x], q = [y], x, y ∈ U , and x · y ≥ 0; that is, the angle θ ≥ 0 between x and y is at most π/2. This fact together with the following simple proposition will allow us to figure out the distance (in the sense of Riemannian geometry) between two points in RPn.\nProposition B.4. Let π : M → N be a Riemannian covering map between two Riemannian manifolds (M, g) and (N, h). Then, the geodesics of (N, h) are the projections of geodesics in (M, g) (i.e., curves π ◦ γ in (N, h), where γ is a geodesic in (M, g)), and the geodesics of (M, g) are the liftings of geodesics in (N, h) (i.e., curves γ of (M, g), such that π ◦ γ is a geodesic in (N, h)).\nThe proof of Proposition B.4 can be found in Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine [9] (Proposition 2.81).\nNow, if (M, g) is a connected Riemannian manifold, recall that we define the distance d(p, q) between two points p, q ∈M as\nd(p, q) = inf{L(γ) | γ : [0, 1]→M},\nwhere γ is any piecewise C1-curve from p to q, and\nL(γ) = ∫ 1 0 √ g(γ′(t), γ′(t)) dt\nis the length of γ. It is well known that d is a metric on M . The Hopf-Rinow Theorem (see Gallot, Hulin, Lafontaine [9], Theorem 2.103) says among other things that (M, g) is geodesically complete (which means that every geodesics γ of M can be extended to a geodesic γ̃ defined on all of R) iff any two points of M can be joined by a minimal geodesic iff (M,d) is a complete metric space. Therefore, in a complete (connected) manifold\nd(p, q) = inf{L(γ) | γ : [0, 1]→M is a geodesic}.\n118 APPENDIX B. RIEMANNIAN METRICS ON QUOTIENT MANIFOLDS\nIn particular, compact manifolds are complete, so the distance between two points is the infimum of the length of minimal geodesics joining these points.\nApplying this to RPn and the canonical Euclidean metric induced by Rn+1, since geodesics of Sn are great circles, by the discussion above, for any two points p = [x] and q = [y] in RPn, with x, y ∈ Sn, the distance between them is given by\nd(p, q) = d([x], [y]) = { cos−1(x · y) if x · y ≥ 0 cos−1(−x · y) if x · y < 0.\nHere cos−1(z) = arccos(z) is the unique angle θ ∈ [0, π] such that cos(θ) = z. Equivalently,\nd([x], [y]) = cos−1(|x · y|),\nand d([x], [y]) = min{cos−1(x · y), π − cos−1(x · y)}.\nIf the representatives x, y ∈ Rn+1 of p = [x] and q = [q] are not unit vectors, then d([x], [y]) = cos−1 ( |x · y| ‖x‖ ‖y‖ ) .\nNote that 0 ≤ d(p, q) ≤ π/2. Now, the Euclidean distance between x and y on Sn is given by\n‖x− y‖22 = ‖x‖ 2 2 + ‖y‖ 2 2 − 2x · y = 2− 2 cos θ = 4 sin 2(θ/2).\nThus, ‖x− y‖2 = 2 sin(θ/2), 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. It follows that for any x ∈ Sn, and for any subset A ⊆ Sn, a point a ∈ A minimizes the distance dSn(x, a) = cos\n−1(x · a) = θ on Sn iff it minimizes the Euclidean distance ‖x− a‖2 = 2 sin(θ/2) (since 0 ≤ θ ≤ π). Then, on RP\nn, for any point p = [x] ∈ RPn and any A ⊆ RPn, a point [a] ∈ A minimizes the distance d([x], [a]) on RPn iff it minimizes min{‖x− a‖2 , ‖x+ a‖2}. So, we are looking for [b] ∈ A such that\nmin{‖x− b‖2 , ‖x+ b‖2} = min [a]∈A min{‖x− a‖2 , ‖x+ a‖2}\n= min{min [a]∈A ‖x− a‖2 , min [a]∈A ‖x+ a‖2}.\nIf the subset A ⊆ Sn is closed under the antipodal map (which means that if x ∈ A, then −x ∈ A), then finding mina∈A d([x], [a]) on RPn is equivalent to finding mina∈A ‖x− a‖2, the minimum of the Euclidean distance. This is the case for the set X in Section 4.2 and the set K in Section 4.3. Acknowlegments: First, it must be said that the seminal and highly original work of Jianbo Shi and Stella Yu on normalized cuts, was the source of inspiration for this document. I also\n119\nwish to thank Katerina Fragkiadaki for pointing out a number of mistakes in an earlier version of this paper. Roberto Tron also made several suggestions that contributed to improving this report. Katerina, Ryan Kennedy, Andrew Yeager, and Weiyu Zhang made many useful comments and suggestions. Special thanks to Jocelyn Quaintance, Joao Cedoc and Marcelo Siqueira who proofread my manuscript with an eagle’s eye, and made many comments that helped me improve it. Finally, thanks to Dan Spielman for making available his lovely survey on spectral graph theory, and to Kostas for giving me the opportunity to hold hostage a number of people for three Friday afternoons in a row.\n120 APPENDIX B.

    "abstractText" : "This is a survey of the method of graph cuts and its applications to graph clustering of weighted unsigned and signed graphs. I provide a fairly thorough treatment of the method of normalized graph cuts, a deeply original method due to Shi and Malik, including complete proofs. I also cover briefly the method of ratio cuts, and show how it can be viewed as a special case of normalized cuts. I include the necessary background on graphs and graph Laplacians. I then explain in detail how the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian can be used to draw a graph. This is an attractive application of graph Laplacians. The main thrust of this paper is the method of normalized cuts. I give a detailed account for K = 2 clusters, and also for K > 2 clusters, based on the work of Yu and Shi. I also show how both graph drawing and normalized cut K-clustering can be easily generalized to handle signed graphs, which are weighted graphs in which the weight matrix W may have negative coefficients. Intuitively, negative coefficients indicate distance or dissimilarity. The solution is to replace the degree matrix D by the matrix D in which absolute values of the weights are used, and to replace the Laplacian L = D −W by the signed Laplacian L = D −W . The signed Laplacian L is always positive semidefinite, and it may be positive definite (for unbalanced graphs, see Chapter 5). As far as I know, the generalization of K-way normalized clustering to signed graphs is new. Finally, I show how the method of ratio cuts, in which a cut is normalized by the size of the cluster rather than its volume, is just a special case of normalized cuts. All that needs to be done is to replace the normalized Laplacian Lsym by the unormalized Laplacian L. This is also true for signed graphs (where we replace Lsym by L). Three points that do not appear to have been clearly articulated before are elaborated: 1. The solutions of the main optimization problem should be viewed as tuples in the K-fold cartesian product of projective space RPN−1. 2. When K > 2, the solutions of the relaxed problem should be viewed as elements of the Grassmannian G(K,N). 3. Two possible Riemannian distances are available to compare the closeness of solutions: (a) The distance on (RPN−1)K . (b) The distance on the Grassmannian. I also clarify what should be the necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix to represent a partition of the vertices of a graph to be clustered.",
