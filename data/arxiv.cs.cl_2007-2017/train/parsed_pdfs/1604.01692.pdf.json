      "text" : "Vector space models are an effective way to express the meanings of natural-language terms in a computational system. These models are created using machine-learning techniques that represent words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space, such that the cosine similarity of any two terms corresponds to their semantic similarity.\nThese vectors, referred to as the embeddings of the terms in the vector space, can also be used as an input to further steps of machine learning. When algorithms expect dense vectors as input, embeddings provide a representation that is both more compact and more informative than the “one-hot” representation in which every term in the vocabulary gets its own dimension.\nThis kind of vector space has been used in applications such as search, topic detection, and text classification, dating back to the introduction of latent semantic analysis (Deerwester et al., 1990). In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in natural-language embeddings, as machine-learning techniques such as Mikolov et al. (2013)’s word2vec and Pennington et al. (2014)’s GloVe have begun to show dramatic improvements. Word embeddings are often suggested as an initialization for more complex methods, such as the sentence encodings of Kiros et al. (2015).\nFaruqui et al. (2015) introduced a technique known as “retrofitting”, which combines embeddings learned from the distributional semantics of unstructured text with a source of structured connections between words. The combined embedding achieves performance on word-similarity evaluations superior to either source individually.\nHere, we build on the retrofitting process to produce a high-quality space of word embeddings. We extend existing techniques in the following ways:\n• We modify the retrofitting algorithm, making it not depend on the row order of its input matrix, and allowing it to propagate over the union of the vocabularies. This allows retrofitting to benefit from structured links outside the original vocabulary, such as translations into other languages. We call this procedure “expanded retrofitting”.\n• We include ConceptNet, a Linked Open Data semantic network that expresses many kinds of relationships between words in many lan-\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n01 69\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nA pr\n2 01\nguages, as a source of structured connections between words.\n• We align English terms from different sources using a lemmatizer and a heuristic for merging together multiple term vectors.\n• We fill gaps when aligning the two distributional-semantics sources (GloVe and word2vec) using a locally linear interpolation.\n• We re-scale the distributional-semantics features using L1 normalization.\nWhen we use this process to combine word2vec, GloVe, PPDB, and ConceptNet, this process produces a space of multilingual term embeddings we call the “ConceptNet vector ensemble” that achieves state-of-the-art performance on wordsimilarity evaluations1 over both common and rare words."

      "text" : "word2vec and GloVe are two current systems that learn vector representations of words according to their distributional semantics. Given a large text corpus, they produce vectors representing similarities in how the words co-occur with other words.\nMikolov et al. (2013) described a system of distributional word embeddings called Skip-Grams with Negative Sampling (SGNS), which is more popularly known by the name of its software implementation, word2vec. (The word2vec software also implements another representation, Continuous Bag-ofWords or CBOW, which is less often used for word similarity.)\nIn SGNS, a neural network with one hidden layer is trained to recognize words that are likely to appear near each other. Its goal is to output a high value when given examples of co-occurrences that appear in the data, and a low value for negative examples where one word is replaced by a random word. The loss function is weighted by the frequencies of the words involved and the distance between them in the data. The word2vec software3 comes with SGNS embeddings of text from Google News.\nGloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a set of word embeddings such that the dot product of two words’ embeddings is approximately equal to the logarithm of their co-occurrence count. The algorithm operates on a global word-word co-occurrence matrix, and solves an optimization problem to learn a vector for each word, a separate vector for each context (although the contexts are also words), and a bias value for each word and each context. Only the word vectors are used for computing similarity.\nThe embeddings that GloVe learns from data sources such as the Common Crawl4 are distributed on the GloVe web page5. Here we evaluate two downloadable sets of GloVe 1.2 embeddings, built from 42 billion and 840 billion tokens of the Common Crawl, respectively.\nThere is some debate about whether GloVe or word2vec is better at representing word meanings\n3https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 4http://commoncrawl.org/ 5http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\nin general. GloVe is presented by Pennington et al. (2014) as performing better than word2vec on wordsimilarity tasks, but Levy et al. (2015) finds that word2vec performs better with an optimized setting of hyperparameters than GloVe does, when retrained with a particular corpus.\nIn this paper, we focus only on the downloadable sets of term embeddings that the GloVe and word2vec projects provide, not on re-running them with tuned hyperparameters. Using this data makes it possible to reproduce their results and compare directly to them, even when their preferred input data is not available. We find that we can get very good results derived from the downloadable embeddings, and that GloVe’s downloadable embeddings outperform word2vec’s in this case, but a combination of them can perform even better."

      "text" : "Faruqui et al. (2015) introduced the “retrofitting” procedure, which adjusts dense matrices of embeddings (such as the GloVe output) to take into account external knowledge from a sparse semantic network. They tried various sources of external knowledge, and the one that was most helpful to GloVe was PPDB. We found using ConceptNet to be more effective, and that further marginal improvements could be achieved on some evaluations by combining ConceptNet and PPDB.\nOur goal is to create a 300-dimensional vector space that represents terms based on a combination of GloVe and word2vec’s downloadable embeddings, and structured data from ConceptNet and PPDB. The resulting vector space allows information to be shared among these various representations, including words that were not in the vocabulary of the original representations. This includes low-frequency words and even words that are not in English.\nThe complete process of building this vector space, whose steps will be explained throughout this paper, appears in Figure 1.\nAs Levy et al. (2015) notes, “[. . . ] much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves.” While it is presented as a negative result, this simply emphasizes the importance of these system design choices.\nIndeed, we have found that choices about how to handle terms and their embeddings have a significant impact on evaluation results. One of these choices involves how to pre-process words and phrases before looking them up, and another involves the scale of the various features in the embeddings."

      "heading" : "3.1 Transforming and Aligning Vocabularies",
      "text" : "Different representations apply different preprocessing steps, placing strings in different equivalence classes. We can only properly combine these resources if these string representations are comparable to each other.\nPre-processing steps that various resources apply include: tokenizing text to separate words from punctuation (which all inputs except GloVe 840B do), joining multi-word phrases with underscores (ConceptNet and word2vec), removing a small list of stopwords from multi-word phrases (ConceptNet only), folding the text to lowercase (ConceptNet and GloVe 42B), replacing multiple digits with the character # (word2vec only), and lemmatizing English words to their root form using a modification of WordNet’s Morphy algorithm (ConceptNet only).\nWe adapt a text pre-processing function from ConceptNet to apply a combination of all of these processes, yielding a set of standardized, languagetagged labels. As an example, the text “Giving an example” becomes the standardized form /c/en/give example. Applying this combined pre-processing function to all labels increases the alignment of the various resources while reducing the size of the combined vocabulary.\nBecause the transformations are many-to-one, this has the effect that a single transformed term can become associated with multiple embeddings in a single vector space. We considered a few options for dealing with these merged terms, such as keeping only the highest-frequency term, averaging the vectors together, or taking a weighted average based on their word frequency.\nWe found in preliminary evaluations that the weighted average was the best approach. The multiple rows contain valuable data that should not simply be discarded, but lower-frequency rows tend to have lower-quality data.\nWhen using pre-trained vectors, it is often the case that intermediate computations that produced these vectors (such as word frequencies) are not available. What we do instead is to infer approximate word frequencies from the fact that both GloVe and word2vec output their vocabularies in descending order of frequency. We approximate the frequency distribution by assuming that the tokens are\ndistributed according to Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949): the nth token in rank order has a frequency proportional to 1/n. We use these proportions in the weighted average when combining multiple embeddings.\nThis process alone is a benefit on word-similarity evaluations, even without combining any resources. For example, the Rare Words (RW) dataset (Luong et al., 2013) tends to encounter terms that are poorly represented or out-of-vocabulary in most word embeddings. Lemmatizing them before looking them up, and combining them with more frequently observed representations, improves the evaluation results on these words, even though the process loses the ability to distinguish some word forms. The raw GloVe 840B data gets a Spearman correlation of ρ = .146 on the RW dataset, which increases to ρ = .494 when its embeddings are standardized and combined in this way.\nFigure 2 shows the size of the vocabularies of ConceptNet, GloVe, and word2vec after this transformation, and the sizes of the overlaps among them, using a proportional-area Venn diagram produced using eulerAPE (Micallef and Rodgers, 2014)."

      "text" : "As briefly mentioned by Pennington et al. (2014), L2 normalization of the columns (that is, the 300 features) of the GloVe matrix provides a notable increase in performance. One effect of normalization is to increase the weight of distinguishing features and reduce the impact of noisy features. Features are more distinguishing for the purpose of cosine similarity when they contain a few large values and many small ones.\nWe find that L1 normalization of GloVe performs even better than L2 normalization. L1 causes occasional large values to have a smaller impact on the norm than L2 normalization. When a learning method such as GloVe has provided highly selective features, L1 normalization allows us to use them more effectively in measuring similarity."

      "heading" : "3.3 Retrofitting",
      "text" : "Retrofitting (Faruqui et al., 2015) is a process of combining existing word vectors with a semantic lexicon. While the original formulation expresses the problem in terms of updates that propagate over a set of edges, we have found it more convenient to\nexpress it and implement it in terms of an update to a matrix.\nThe inputs to retrofitting are an initialm×n dense matrix of term embeddings, W 0, and a list of known semantic relationships.\nFaruqui et al.’s retrofitting procedure aims to minimize a sum of a word’s distance from its neighbors in the semantic network and its distance from its original vector. Its implementation in code takes steps along the gradient toward this minimum by iteratively updating one vector w′i at a time to be a linear combination between its original position w0i and the average of its neighbors in the semantic network.\nThe advantage of this iterative update is that it only requires two copies of W in memory (W 0 and the current state) and converges quickly. A disadvantage is that the results depend on the order in which the nodes of the graph are iterated, which is arbitrary.\nWe instead choose to update the embeddings all at once by multiplying them by a sparse matrix S of semantic connections. Letting m′ be the size of the merged vocabulary, S is an m′×m′ matrix containing positive weighted values for terms that are known to be semantically related, and 0 otherwise. The rows of S are scaled to have a sum of 1. We then add 1 to its diagonal to help new terms converge on a single vector, as described in more detail below.\nLet W 0 be an m′ × n matrix whose rows come from the original embeddings if available, and are all zeroes for terms outside the vocabulary of the original embeddings. A is a diagonal matrix of weights in which Aii is 1 if term i is in the original vocabulary, and 0 otherwise (allowing us to keep terms near their original embeddings without also keeping outof-vocabulary terms near the zero vector). We can now update W iteratively so that the next iteration of W is a combination of its product with S and its weighted original state, followed by L2 normalization of its non-zero rows6:\nW k+1 = normalize [( SW k +AW 0 ) (I +A)−1 ] The diagonal of the S matrix relates each term to itself. We have found that adding 1 to the diago6 We maintain L2 normalization so that minimizing distance and maximizing cosine similarity are always linked.\nnal – effectively adding “self-loops” to the semantic network – helps the expanded retrofitting process converge. Without this diagonal, terms that only appear in the semantic network, and not in the original embedding space, would get their value only from their neighbors at every step, because their “original position” is the zero vector. This causes large oscillations that prevent convergence. With the diagonal, each term vector is influenced by the vector it had in the previous step.\nAs a practical effect of this, Section 4.5 (Varying the System) will show that expanded retrofitting with self-loops added to the diagonal performs better on word-similarity evaluations than it does without, when allowed to run for 10 steps of retrofitting."

      "heading" : "3.4 ConceptNet as an Association Matrix",
      "text" : "In order to apply the expanded retrofitting method, we need to consider the data in ConceptNet as a sparse, symmetric matrix of associations between terms. What ConceptNet provides is more complex than that, as it connects terms with a variety of notnecessarily-symmetric, labeled relations.\nHavasi et al. (2010) introduced a vector space embedding of ConceptNet, “spectral association”, that disregarded the relation labels for the purpose of measuring the relatedness of terms. Previous embeddings of ConceptNet, such as that of Speer et al. (2008), preserved the relations but were suited mostly for direct similarity and inference, not for relatedness. Because most evaluation data for word similarity is also evaluating relatedness, unless there has been a specific effort to separate them (Agirre et al., 2009), we erase the labels as in spectral association.\nEach assertion in ConceptNet corresponds to two entries in a sparse association matrix S. ConceptNet assigns a confidence score, or weight, to each assertion. These weights are not entirely comparable between the data sources that comprise ConceptNet, so we re-scaled them so that the average weight of each different data source is 1.\nAn assertion that relates term i to term j with adjusted weightw will contributew to the values of Sij and Sji. If another assertion relates the same terms with a different relation, it will add to that value. This constructs a symmetric matrix S, but the matrix we actually use in retrofitting is the asymmetric\nS′, whose rows have been L1-normalized to prevent high-frequency concepts from overwhelming the results.\nDue to the structure of ConceptNet, there exists a large fringe of terms that are poorly connected to other nodes. To make the sparse matrix and the size of the overall vocabulary more manageable, we filter ConceptNet when building its association matrix: we exclude all terms that appear fewer than 3 times, English terms that appear fewer than 4 times, and terms with more than 3 words in them."

      "heading" : "3.5 Locally Linear Alignment",
      "text" : "In order to use both word2vec and GloVe at the same time, we need to align their partially-overlapping vocabularies and merge their features. This is straightforward to do on the terms that are shared between the two vocabularies, but we would rather not lose the other terms, if we can later benefit from learning more about those terms from ConceptNet.\nBefore merging features, we need to compute GloVe representations for terms represented in word2vec but not GloVe, and vice versa. The way we do this is inspired by Zhao et al. (2015), who infer translations between languages of unknown phrases using a locally-linear projection of known translations of similar phrases. Instead of known translations, we have the terms that overlap between word2vec and GloVe. Given a non-overlapping term, we calculate its vector as the average of the vectors of the nearest overlapping terms, weighted by their cosine similarity.\nTo combine the features of word2vec and GloVe, we first concatenate their vectors into 600- dimensional vectors. We then discount redundancy between its features by transforming these 600- dimensional vectors with a singular value decomposition (SVD). We factor the matrix M of concatenated vectors as M = UΣV T , then compute the new joint features as UΣ1/2. UΣ would be an orthogonal rotation of the original features; UΣ1/2 reduces the effect of its largest eigenvalues, making over-represented features relatively smaller.\nAs with many decisions we make in preparing this data, we evaluated the benefit of this step on our development data sets. Discounting redundancy by replacing Σ by Σ1/2 provides a benefit on two out\nof three data sets for evaluating word similarity, as shown in Section 4.5.\nIt is common to use SVD as a form of dimensionality reduction, by discarding the smallest singular values and truncating the matrix accordingly. Section 4.5 shows that we can reduce the interpolated matrix to from 600 dimensions to 450 or 300 dimensions without much loss in performance."

For example, if an evaluation requires similarities for the words “dry” and “dried” to be ranked differently, or the words “polish” and “Polish”, the lemmatized system will rank them the same, and will be penalized in its Spearman correlation.

To show the benefits of certain decisions, such as adding selfloops or the way we choose to merge rows of GloVe, we have evaluated what happens to the system in the absence of each decision. These evaluations appear in Table 5. These evaluations were part of how we decided on the best configuration of the system, so they were run on the development sets of RW and MEN-3000, not the held-out test sets.\nIn Table 5, we can see that the choice of how to merge rows of GloVe that get the same standardized label makes a large difference. Recall that the method we ultimately used was to assign each row a pseudo-frequency based on Zipf’s law, and then take a weighted average based on those frequencies. The results drop noticeably when we try the other proposed methods, which are taking only the first (most frequent) row that appears, or taking the unweighted average of the rows.\nThe same table shows that we can save some computation time and space by reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors while building the matrix that combines word2vec and GloVe. Reducing the dimensionality seems to cause a small degradation in RW score, but the MEN and WordSim scores stay around the same value, even increasing by an inconclusive amount in some cases.\nIf we skip applying the SVD at all in the interpolation step – that is, when a term has features in word2vec and GloVe, we simply concatenate those features with all their redundancy – it lowers the RW score somewhat, but raises the WordSim-353 score.\nIn the retrofitting procedure, we made the decision to add “self-loops” that connect each term to itself, because this helps stabilize the representations of terms that are outside the original vocabulary of GloVe. Reversing this decision (and running for the same number of steps) causes a noticeable drop in performance on RW, the evaluation that is most likely to involve words that were poorly represented or unrepresented in GloVe.\nIn separate experimentation, we found that when\nwe separate ConceptNet into its component datasets and drop each one in turn, the effects on the evaluation results are mostly quite small. There is no single dataset that acts as the “keystone” without which the system falls apart, but one dataset — Wiktionary — unsurprisingly has a larger effect than the others, because it is responsible for most of the assertions. Of the 5,631,250 filtered assertions that come from ConceptNet, 4,244,410 of them are credited to Wiktionary.\nWithout Wiktionary, the score on RW drops from .587 to .541. However, at the same time, the MEN3000 score increases from .858 to .865. The system continues to do what it is designed to do without Wiktionary, but there seems to be a tradeoff in performance on rare words and common words involved."

Instead, we can benefit from both of them using a locally-linear interpolation between them.\nWe showed that ConceptNet is a useful source of structured knowledge that was not consid-\nered in previous work on retrofitting distributional semantics with structured knowledge, especially when retrofitting is generalized into our expanded retrofitting technique, which can benefit from links that are outside the original vocabulary."

      "heading" : "5.1 Future Work",
      "text" : "One aspect of our method that clearly has room for improvement is the fact that we disregard the labels on relations in ConceptNet. There is valuable knowledge there that we might be able to take into account with a more sophisticated extension of retrofitting, one that goes beyond simply knowing that particular words should be related, to handling them differently based on how they are related, as in the RESCAL representation (Nickel et al., 2011). This seems particularly important for antonyms, which indicate that words are similar overall but different in a key aspect, such as forming two ends of the same scale.\nLemmatization is clearly a useful component of our word-similarity representation, but it loses information. Representing morphological relationships as operations in the vector space, as in Soricut and Och (2015), could yield a better representation of similarities between forms of words.\nWe believe that the variety of data sources represented in ConceptNet helped to improve evaluation scores by expanding the domain of the system’s knowledge. There’s no reason the improvement needs to stop here. It is quite likely that there are more sources of linked open data that could be included, or further standardizations that could be applied to the text to align more data. An appropriate representation of Universal WordNet (De Melo and Weikum, 2009) could improve the multilingual performance, for example, as could embeddings built\nfrom the distribution of words in non-English text. Adapting Rothe and Schütze’s AutoExtend representation could provide a representation of word senses and a more specific understanding of words to the system."
