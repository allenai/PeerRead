      "text" : "Recently, there have been many algorithms proposed for nonlinear dimension reduction, which include Isomap (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), locally linear embedding (LLE) (Roweis & Saul, 2000), kernel-LLE (Ham et al., 2004), Hessian LLE (Donoho & Grimes, 2003), local tangent alignment (Zhang & Zha, 2004), Laplacian embedding (Hall, 1971; Belkin & Niyogi, 2001), and many variations. Above dimension reduction algorithms usually cover two main steps: (A) for each data point, learn the local geometry information W. This W can be viewed as similarity between data points or the edge weights of a graph whose nodes are the data points. We call this W-learning, or learning the graph weights. (B) Using the learned W to embed the high-dimensional data points into a lower-dimensional space Y. We call this Y-learning, or learn the embedding. The performance of those algorithms are\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\ndetermined both by learning the local information and also by constructing the mapping relations.\nIn past decades, many clustering algorithms have been proposed such as K-means, spectral clustering and its variants (Ng et al., 2001), normalized cut (Shi & Malik, 1997), ratio cut (Chan et al., 1994), etc. Among them, the use of manifold information in graph cuts has shown the state-of-the-art clustering performance.\nOne key observation is that both LLE and spectral clustering utilize the data manifold information. This motivates us to investigate deeper relations between the LLE Y-learning and spectral clustering in terms of Laplacian embedding (because the embedding is precisely the relaxed cluster indicators for the spectral clustering). Indeed, we discover that a properly modified formulation of Y-learning provides a solution which is identical to the normalized Laplacian embedding (see §2.3). We incorporate this improvement into our final iterative LLE algorithm.\nAnother observation is that the data geometry information encoded in W also plays a central role in the performance of these algorithms. We investigate the W-learning process and propose a nonnegative, kernelized, sparse W-learning algorithm (see §4).\nFurthermore, we propose to iteratively repeat the two mains steps (W-learning and Y-learning) to improve the results progressively. Here we use the learned embedding Y to augment the input data to learn a better W, which leads to a better Y in turn. This is repeated until the process converges (details are given in §3). This iterative procedure incorporates both the improved Y learning and the improved W learning into a coherent iterative LLE algorithm.\nThe experiment results for clustering and semisupervised learning tasks on 9 datasets show clear performance improvements."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose improved formulations in both main steps in LLE. (A) In the W-learning step of Eq.(1), we propose new improved formulations to learnW. We first makeW nonnegative in this section. We will further propose a kernelized sparse learning in §4. (B) In the Y-learning step of Eq.(2), we propose slightly modified formulation and prove that the solution to Eq.(2) is identical to Normalized Cut or Laplacian embedding. Our iterative LLE algorithm is based on these improved formations in both LLE steps.\nTo make a connection to graph embedding, we (1) restrict W to be nonnegative, i.e., we add constraint W ≥ 0 to Eq.(1) (as done in (Wang & Zhang, 2006)); (2) we symmetrize W to obtain Z = 12 (W +W\nT ) as the graph edge weight/similarity matrix; (3) we impose D-orthogonal constraint on Y, i.e., YDYT = I, where D = diag(Ze) is a diagonal matrix containing node degrees.\nWith these three changes, the LLE equations of Eqs.(1,2) become\nmin W\n∑\ni\n||xi − ∑\nj∈Ni\nWijxj || 2 , s.t. W ≥ 0, (3)\nmin Y\n∑\ni\ndi||yi − ∑\nj\n(D−1Z)ijyj || 2 s.t. YDYT = I, (4)\nwhere di = Dii.\nWe note several important changes here. In Eq.(4), D−1 is inserted for two important reasons: (1) Note that ∑ j(D\n−1Z)ijyj is the average values of yi’s neighbors. Thus Eq.(4) enforces the smoothness of function {yi}. (2) It also enforces the shift invariance of obtainedY, because ∑ j(D\n−1Z)ij = 1. This implies that if {y∗i } is an optimal solution, so is {y ∗ i −c} where c is a constant vector. Note that we add di as the weight of each point yi, for reasons immediately clear below."

It holds for any symmetric nonnegative graph similarity function Z. More precisely we have theorem (1),\nTheorem 1. For any symmetric nonnegative graph similarity function Z of the formulation of Eq.(4), the optimal solution of Y is identical to the optimal solution H of normalized cut spectral clustering, given graph weight matrix Z.\nIn the following, we first briefly introduce normalized cut and present the proof of Theorem 1.\nNormalized Cut.\nNormalized cut (Shi & Malik, 1997) is an effective graph partitioning (clustering) technique to identify clusters inherent in the data, given the pairwise similarity matrix Z. It is well-known now multi-way normalized cut can be solved by the following problem,\nmin G\nTr(GT (I− Z̃)G) s.t. GTG = Ik, (5)\nwhere Z̃ = D− 1 2ZD− 1\n2 . and G = [g1,g2, · · ·,gk] are relaxed cluster indicators. The optimal solution for G is the smallest k eigenvectors from (I− Z̃), i.e.,\n(I− Z̃)gk = µkgk. (6)\nThe cluster indicator H = [h1,h2, · · ·,hk] is\nhk = D − 1 2 gk, H = D − 1 2G. (7)\nRelation to Laplacian Embedding.\nIt is easy to see that HT = V ≡ [v1, · · · ,vn] is identical to the solution of\nmin V\n∑\nij\nWij‖vi − vj‖ 2 s.t. VDVT = Ik. (8)\nThis Laplacian embedding with degree normalization VDVT = Ik is effective for clustering problems because the embedding coordinates are the continuous\nrelaxation of the cluster indicators of the multi-way normalized cut spectral clustering. Similarly, Laplacian embedding using coordinates with standard normalization VVT = Ik is precisely the continuous relaxation of the cluster indicators of multi-way ratio cut spectral clustering (Chan et al., 1994); The widely used linear embedding, Principal component analysis (PCA) is precisely the continuous relaxation of the cluster indicators of the multi-way K-means clustering (Zha et al., 2001; Ding & He, 2004).\nTheorem 1 can be equivalently expressed for Laplacian embedding."

It is easy to see the optimal solution F = [f1, f2, · · ·, fk] for Eq.(13) is the smallest k eigenvectors from (I − Z̃)2, i.e., Eq.(9). Thus the optimal solution Y∗ = (D− 1 2F)T = FTD− 1 2 .\nProof of Theorem 1.\nProof. Because (I − Z̃) is semi-definite positive, the eigenvectors gk of Eq.(6) can be uniquely mapped to eigenvectors gk of\n(I− Z̃)2gk = µ 2 kgk.

In this paper, we propose to use Y as the new data and iterate this process to further improve the embedding. The key observation is that the class structure of the data is more clear in Y than in X (this is the original embedding purpose of LLE). Thus we use Y as the new data and repeat this process to learn an improved Y.\n(B) Kernel generalization\nFrom experiments on several datasets, the results of using linear formulation on X for learning W in Eq.(1) are generally not as good as other state-of-art methods. Here we use the kernel trick to generalize this to arbitrary nonlinear similarity function. We re-write Eq.(1) as\nmin W\n∑\ni\n||φ(xi)− ∑\nj∈Ni\nWijφ(xi)|| 2 , (15)\nwhere φ(xi) is a mapping to a higher dimensional space. The important thing here is that the exact form of the mapping function is not needed; only the inner product Kij = 〈φ(xi), φ(xj)〉 is needed.\nUsing matrix notation, the LLE of Eq.(1) can be written as min\nW ||X−XWT ||2, and Eq.(15) can be written\nas\n||φ(X)− φ(X)WT ||2 = Tr(K −WK −KWT +WKWT ).

So far for LLE of Eq.(1) and the new kernel version of Eq.(16), we maintain the original LLE convention that W preserves the kNN structure, i.e. Wij 6= 0 for only j ∈ Ni (kNN of object i).\nThis constraint is too strong for constructing the data similarity matrix W. Thus, in our approach, we relax this to let Wij be nonzero even if j 6∈ Ni. In other words, we bypass kNN entirely.\nWe now present a new approach to learn the pairwise similarity matrix S ∈ <n×n, where Sij represents the i-th data’s contribution to reconstruct data point xj . We hope the newly learned S has much clear structure. We use the symbol S to emphasize that W is learned using the new approach. Our objective function for learning S is,\nmin S≥0 ‖X−XS‖2 + αTr(STS) + β||S||1,1, (17)\nwhere α and β are regularization parameters, ||S||1,1 = ∑ ij |Sij |.

We further propose to iterate the two steps in LLE repeatedly to improve the results. Extensive experiment results show that iterative LLE algorithm significantly improves both classification and clustering results.",
