      "text" : "This paper introduces a multi-period inspector scheduling problem (MPISP), which is a\nnew variant of the multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). In the\nMPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route in a given multi-period planning\nhorizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the depot\nbut has to stay at one of the vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current\nperiod is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex A to a certain\nvertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period\nor traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B.

      "text" : "This paper studies a new manpower routing and scheduling problem faced by a company\nthat procures products from over one thousand suppliers across Asia. The company places\norders with a large number of suppliers and must inspect the goods at the factories of the\nsuppliers before shipment. Therefore, the suppliers are required to make inspection requests\nwith the company when the ordered goods are ready for delivery. An inspection request is\ncharacterized by the workload, the inspection site and the time window within which the\ninspection can be started. In turn, the company dispatches a team of professional quality\ninspectors to perform all on-site inspections. In order to facilitate coordination between\ninspectors and suppliers, the inspections could only be carried out during working hours (e.g.,\n8:00 am to 6:00 pm). Usually, a weekly schedule is created to assign inspectors to requests\nfor the upcoming week. The company has a stable of in-house inspectors, each having\na specified weekly workload limit, and the unfulfilled inspection requests are outsourced to\nexternal agencies with additional costs. After receiving their weekly inspection schedules, the\ninspectors depart from the regional office and will not report back until they have performed\nall their assigned inspections for the week. More specifically, they leave the regional office\non Monday, visit a set of inspection sites and return to the regional office on Friday or\nsome earlier workday. In each workday, an inspector generally travels to diffident locations,\ncompletes several inspections and finds overnight accommodation (i.e., hotel) in the vicinity\nof his/her last/next inspection site at or before the end of the office hours. The objective of\nthe problem is to assign as many inspection workloads as possible to the stable of in-house\ninspectors while satisfying all the above-mentioned practical constraints.\n∗Corresponding author at: School of Mobile Information Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Tang Jia Bay, Zhuhai, Guangdong, China.

There are four main features that distin-\nguish the MPISP from the multi-trip VRPTW. First, the scheduling subjects, e.g., vehicles\nor inspectors, are not required to return to the regional office every workday. Second, at the\nend of each workday, each scheduling subject must stay at one of the vertices for recupera-\ntion. Third, each vertex can be visited more than once. If the remaining time of the current\nperiod is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex A to a certain\nvertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period or\ntraveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B. The vertex C is called a waypoint, which\nonly acts as the intermediate point in a route. Fourth, the objective is to maximize the total\ninspected workload rather than to minimize the number of inspectors used and/or the total\ndistance traveled.\nIn this study, we propose a tabu search algorithm to solve the MPISP. This algorithm\nemploys a tailored fitness function consisting of three lexicographically ordered components,\na local improvement procedure with tabu moves, an ejection pool improvement process and\na perturbation phase. The contributions of this study are fourfold. First, we introduce a\nnew and practical multi-period manpower routing and scheduling problem that considers\nmultiple working periods. Second, we provide an effective tabu search algorithm that uses\na set of problem-specific neighborhood search operators. Third, we construct a constrained\nknapsack model that can produce an upper bound for the MPISP. Fourth, the comprehen-\nsive experimental results on a large number of test instances show the effectiveness of our\napproach.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first provide an overview of\nrelated research in Section 2. In Section 3, we then give a formal definition of the MPISP.\nIn Section 4, we describe an approach of computing the shortest transit time for any pair\nof vertices with any departure time. Our proposed tabu search algorithm is detailed in\nSection 5 and the constrained knapsack model is presented in Section 6. Section 7 reports\nthe experiments results and Section 8 concludes this study with some closing remarks. 3"

      "text" : "The MPISP is one type of manpower scheduling problems. Scheduling staff members is\na traditional research area; example problems include the nurse rostering problem (Cheang\net al., 2003), the technician planning problem (Ernst et al., 2004) and the airline crew\nrostering problem (Kohl and Karisch, 2004). As for the manpower scheduling problems that\ninvolve creating routes for staff members, we refer the reader to Li et al. (2005); Tang et al.\n(2007); Zäpfel and Bögl (2008); Cai et al. (2013); Zhang et al. (2013).\nSince each inspector has to perform inspections at different locations, the MPISP is\nessentially a variant of the vehicle routing problem (Toth and Vigo, 2002). One of the\ndefining characteristics is its objective of maximizing the total inspected workload. Two\npreviously studied problems with similar objective are the team orienteering problem with\ntime windows (TOPTW) (Vansteenwegen et al., 2009, 2011; Labadie et al., 2012; Hu and\nLim, 2014) and the vehicle routing problem with time windows and a limited number of\nvehicles (m-VRPTW) (Lau et al., 2003; Lim and Zhang, 2007). The m-VRPTW is an\nextension of the TOPTW with the consideration of vehicle capacity and customer demands.\nThese two problems both aim to determine a set of routes that maximizes the total reward\nof the vertices visited during a single period with a distance or duration limit. The multi-\nperiod planning horizon of the MPISP is related to the periodic vehicle routing problem\n(PVRP) (Gaudioso and Paletta, 1992; Hemmelmayr et al., 2009) and the multiple trip\nvehicle routing problem (MTVRP) (Battarra et al., 2009). However, the MPISP is quite\ndifferent from the PVRP and MTVRP. In the PVRP, each customer requires a certain\nnumber of visits within the planning horizon, and two types of decisions are involved in the\nplanning, namely determining the visit days for each customer and the routing plan for each\ntime period. The PVRP and MTVRP both require that each vehicle must return to the\ndepot at the end of each period.\nAnother defining characteristic of the MPISP is the consideration of multiple working\nperiods. Working hour regulations have recently received increasing attention from some re-\nsearchers studying vehicle routing problems. Savelsbergh and Sol (1998) proposed a dynamic\n4\nand general pickup and delivery problem in which lunch and night breaks must be taken\ninto account. Xu et al. (2003) applied column generation based solution approaches to solve\na pickup and delivery vehicle routing problem that involves a set of practical complications,\nsuch as heterogeneous vehicles, last-in-first-out loading and unloading operations, pickup\nand delivery time windows, and working hour restrictions by the United States Department\nof Transportation. Similarly, Goel (2009, 2010) and Kok et al. (2010) investigated combined\nvehicle routing and driver scheduling problems under the European Union regulations for\ndrivers.\nThe MPISP problem can be viewed as a natural extension of the orienteering problem\nwith hotel selection (OPHS) (Divsalar et al., 2013, 2014). In the OPHS, a scheduling subject\ncan visit a set of vertices each with a score and find accommodation at a given set of hotels.\nThe tour is divided into multiple trips, each with a limited duration and starting from and\nending at one of the hotels. The objective of the OPHS is to determine a tour that maximizes\nthe total collected score. The OPHS is a variant of the traveling salesperson problem with\nhotel selection (TSPHS) (Vansteenwegen et al., 2012; Castro et al., 2013), which aims to\nserve all vertices with the minimum number of connected trips and the minimum total travel\ndistance. The common characteristic of the above three problems is the involvement of hotel\nselection.\nTang et al. (2007) and Zäpfel and Bögl (2008) introduced two manpower routing and\nscheduling problems that involve maximization of profits, multiple periods and working hour\nrestrictions. However, their problems require that the trip in each period must start from\nand end at the depot. Most recently, Zhang et al. (2013) proposed an inspector scheduling\nproblem which is very similar to our problem. Their problem differs from our problem in\nthe following four assumptions: (1) each vertex can only be visited at most once; (2) if a\nvertex is visited by an inspector, its inspection request must be fulfilled by this inspector;\n(3) an inspector reaches a vertex and completes the corresponding inspection task in the\nsame period; and (4) each vehicle stays at the last served vertex at the end of each period\nand begins the trip of the next period from that vertex. By ignoring these four assumptions,\nthe MPISP is more difficult but practical. 5"

      "heading" : "3. Problem description",
      "text" : "The MPISP is defined on a directed graph G = (V,E), where V = {0, 1, . . . , n} is the vertex set and E = {(i, j) : i, j ∈ V, i 6= j} is the edge set. Vertex 0 represents the depot location and VC = {1, . . . , n} denotes the locations of n suppliers. Each supplier i is characterized by a location i ∈ VC , a workload di, a required service time si and a time window [ei, li]. For notational convenience, we assign d0 = 0 and s0 = 0 for the depot. Each edge (i, j) ∈ E requires a non-negative traveling time ti,j, where the matrix [ti,j] satisfies the triangle inequality.\nWe are given a set K of m homogeneous inspectors, each of which has a workload limit Q and can only work within a set P = {1, . . . , w} of w working periods (or called working time windows). For any period p ∈ P , ap and bp (ap < bp) are its starting and closing working times, respectively, and bp − ap equals a positive constant T that is not less than si for any i ∈ V . An inspector can arrive at vertex i ∈ VC prior to ei and wait at no cost until the service of supplier i becomes possible. All inspectors must leave the depot\nafter e0 (e0 = a1 = 0) and return to the depot before l0 (l0 = bw), where [e0, l0] is called depot time window. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to\nthe depot but has to stop traveling and stay at one of vertices. Moreover, service cannot\nbe interrupted, i.e., if the service of some supplier cannot be completed before the end of\na period, it must be restarted in the later periods. Each vertex can be visited more than\nonce while each supplier can be served by at most one inspector, so some supplier locations\ncan be used as waypoints. The objective of the MPISP is to construct m inspector routes\nto complete as many workloads as possible while respecting depot time window, workload\nlimit, supplier time windows and inspector working time windows. We provide a mixed\ninteger programming model for the MPISP in Appendix A.\nIn reality, ap should be larger than bp−1, and the duration between ap and bp−1 is the downtime for rest and recuperation. Without loss of generality, we can assume that the\nlength of the downtime is extremely small by setting bp−1 = ap and imposing a break at time bp−1. As illustrated in Figure 1, we can easily transform the non-zero downtime cases\n6\nto zero downtime ones. In Figure 1(a), T = 20 and the time windows of suppliers 1, 2,\nand 3 are [5, 90], [10, 50] and [85, 95], respectively. After transformation, their time windows\nbecome [5, 50], [10, 30] and [45, 55] (see Figure 1(b)).\nTo further describe the MPISP, we convert the graph G = (V,E) into a directed (not complete) graph G′ = (V ′, E ′) by the following two steps: (1) split each vertex i ∈ VC into two vertices i+ and i−, and create an edge (i+, i−), where vertex i+ represents the arrival of vertex i and vertex i− represents the completion of supplier i’s service; (2) create edges (0, i+), (i+, 0), (i−, 0), (i+, j+) and (i−, j+), where i, j ∈ VC and i 6= j; and (3) set ti+,i− = si, t0,i+ = t0,i, ti+,0 = ti−,0 = ti,0 and ti+,j+ = ti−,j+ = ti,j. An example to illustrate this conversion is shown in Figure 2, where Figure 2(b) is the resultant graph derived from\nFigure 2(a).\nWe can denote a feasible solution of the MPISP by S, consisting of m routes, namely S = {r1, r2, . . . , rm}. A route rk (1 ≤ k ≤ m) is divided into w sub-routes by periods and therefore can be expressed as rk = (r 1 k, r 2 k, . . . , r w k ), where r p k (1 ≤ p ≤ w) denotes the trip in period p. If an inspector returns to the depot before period w, he/she will stay at the depot for the remaining periods. The sub-route rpk is a sequence of vertices, where its starting and ending vertices are denoted by vs(r p k) and ve(r p k), respectively. If an inspector k stays at the depot during the whole period p, we set rpk = (0) and vs(r p k) = ve(r p k) = 0. According to the definition of our problem, an inspector must stay at vertex ve(r p k) for rest and will start\n7\nthe next trip from this vertex in period p + 1, i.e, ve(r p k) = vs(r p+1 k ) for all 1 ≤ p ≤ w − 1. Obviously, the starting vertex of period 1 and the ending vertex of period w for each route\nmust be vertex 0. Figure 3 gives a feasible solution to an MPISP instance involving 10\nsuppliers, 4 inspectors and 3 periods.\nS et of unserved suppliers U={9, 10} working idle\nIn Figure 3, the solid and dash lines denote the working (i.e., traveling or providing service) and idle statuses of the inspectors, respectively. The set U = {9, 10} indicates that suppliers 9 and 10 are not served by any inspector. The route r1 = (r 1 1, r 2 1, r 3 1) comprises\n8\nthree trips, i.e., r11 = (0, 1+), r 2 1 = (1+, 1−, 2+, 2−) and r31 = (2−, 3+, 3−, 0). This route shows that inspector 1 arrives at vertex 1, but does not have sufficient time to complete\nthe service for supplier 1 in the first period. Thus, he/she has to wait until the start of the\nsecond period and then provides service to supplier 1. Subsequently, inspector 1 travels to\nvertex 2, completes the service of supplier 2 and stays at vertex 2 for recuperation. In the\nthird period, inspector 1 travels from vertex 2 to vertex 3, provides service for supplier 3, and\nfinally returns to the depot. Since each supplier i can be served by at most one inspector, edge (i+, i−) can be included in at most one route. In route r2, after completing the service of supplier 4, inspector 2 travels to vertex 5 via a waypoint, namely vertex 3. Note that any\nwaypoint must be the ending vertex of a certain period (and also be the starting vertex of the\nfollowing period) due to the rule of triangle inequality. As shown in route r3, an inspector may use two or more waypoints between two consecutively served suppliers. In this route,\ninspector 3 visits but does not serve supplier 9, i.e., vertex 9 only acts as a waypoint. As no route traverses edge (9+, 9−), supplier 9 is not served by any inspector in this solution.\nThe route r4 illustrates that an inspector may be idle during some periods; its three trips are represented by r14 = (0, 8+, 8−, 0), r24 = (0) and r34 = (0)."

      "heading" : "4. Shortest transit time",
      "text" : "In a complete graph that satisfies the triangle inequality, the shortest path from vertex\ni to vertex j must be edge (i, j). When working periods are imposed on the inspectors,\nedge (i, j) may be unusable in some situations and therefore the shortest transit time may\nbe greater than ti,j. The simplest such situation can be encountered when ti,j > T . To move from vertex i to vertex j, an inspector has to use some waypoints and the transit time\nmay cross several periods. We illustrate this situation in Figure 4, where an inspector has\ncompleted the service of supplier i and departs from vertex i at the beginning of a certain\nperiod.\nUnlike the classical VRP models, in the MPISP the shortest transit times from vertex\ni to other vertices are affected by the departure time (denoted by dti) of the inspector. Therefore, we define t̂i,j(dti) as the shortest transit time from vertex i to vertex j with 9\ndeparture time dti. If dti is the opening time of a certain period, i.e., dti = ap for some p ∈ P , t̂i,j(dti) can be simplified to t̂i,j. Further, we define ceil(dti) as the closing time of the period within which dti lies, i.e., if ap < dti ≤ bp, then ceil(dti) = bp. If ceil(dti)− dti ≥ ti,j, an inspector can travel across edge (i, j) within the current period and thus t̂i,j(dti) = ti,j. Otherwise, the inspector has to either wait at vertex i until the start of the next period or\ntravel to some waypoint u. We illustrate these situations in Figure 5, where an inspector\nmay travel from vertex i to vertex j via some waypoint.\nAs previously mentioned, a waypoint u can only be positioned as the last or the first\nvertex in the trip of some period. More precisely, if an inspector travels to a waypoint u, he\n10\nmust stay at u for downtime (see Figure 5(b)). Taking N(dti) = {u ∈ V |ti,u ≤ ceil(dti)−dti} to be the set of all vertices that can act as waypoints for vertex i, the value of t̂i,j(dti) can be calculated by:\nt̂i,j(dti) =  ti,j, if ceil(dti)− dti ≥ ti,j;ceil(dti)− dti + minu∈N(dti)∪{i}{t̂u,j}, otherwise. (1) The above expression shows that computing any t̂i,j(dti) requires O(n) time given the values of all t̂i,j, which can be calculated prior to applying any algorithm to the problem. If the last waypoint between vertex i and vertex j is vertex u, the corresponding shortest transit time, denoted by t̂ui,j, can be obtained by:\nt̂ui,j =  t̂i,u + tu,j, if ceil(t̂i,u)− t̂i,u ≥ tu,j; ceil(t̂i,u) + tu,j, if ceil(t̂i,u)− t̂i,u < tu,j ≤ T ;\n+∞, otherwise.\n(2)\nObviously, we have:\nt̂i,j = min u∈V {t̂ui,j}\nTo compute all t̂i,j, we can apply an algorithm modified from the Dijkstra’s algorithm (Ahuja et al., 1993), one of the most well-known label-setting algorithms for the classical shortest\npath problem. This modified Dijkstra’s algorithm employs expression (2) as the extension function and has a time complexity of O(n2). Since we need to compute the shortest transit time between each vertex pair, the total time complexity for all t̂i,j is bounded by O(n 3).\nWe can accelerate the computation of t̂i,j(dti) by the following procedure. We first remove from the graph all edges whose lengths are greater than T and then sort all neighbors u\nof vertex i in ascending order of ti,u, generating a vertex sequence (i0, i1, . . . , ih). Note that we have i0 = i since ti,i = 0. For 0 ≤ k ≤ h, let t̂(k)i,j = min0≤k′≤k{t̂ik′ ,j} be the shortest transit time from one of the first k + 1 vertices in the sequence to vertex j. The values of all t̂ (k) i,j can be computed by Algorithm 1 in time complexity of O(n 3). Figure 6 pictorially shows the process of computing all t̂ (k) i,j . According to expression (1), t̂i,j(dti) = ceil(dti) − dti + minu∈N(dti)∪{i}{t̂u,j} if ceil(dti) − dti < ti,j. To achieve this t̂i,j(dti), we 11\nidentify the largest k satisfying ceil(dti)−dti ≥ ti,ik using binary search on ti,i0 , ti,i1 , . . . , ti,ih , and retrieve the value of t̂ (k) i,j , which is equal to minu∈N(dti)∪{i}{t̂u,j}. The above procedure shows that the time complexity of computing t̂i,j(dti) can be reduced to O(logn) given that all t̂ (k) i,j are available.\nThe computation of all t̂i,j and t̂ (k) i,j can be done in a preprocessing stage, which requires a time complexity of O(n3). The approach described in the following section needs to\nfrequently compute t̂i,j(dti). Thus, this preprocessing stage is particularly useful to save the overall computation time."

Basically, tabu\nsearch algorithm starts from an initial solution and iteratively proceeds from the incumbent\nsolution to its best allowable neighbor. The neighborhood of a solution is a set of solutions\nthat can be reached from that solution by a certain operation. Each type of operation\ncorresponds to a neighborhood and the procedure of identifying the best allowable neighbor\nin the neighborhood is called an operator. The transition from the incumbent solution to\none of its neighbors is called a move.\nOur tabu search algorithm employs several operations adapted from classical operations for the VRPTW, namely 2-opt, Or-opt, 2-opt∗, Relocate and Exchange (Bräysy and Gen-\ndreau, 2005), and an ejection pool (Lim and Zhang, 2007; Nagata and Bräysy, 2009). The\nmost noteworthy characteristic that distinguishes these adapted operations from their clas-\nsical counterparts is the procedure of checking the feasibility of the modified solution. For\nexample, after performing an operation on a VRPTW solution, we can check the feasibility\nof the resultant solution in O(1) time (it is assumed that for each vertex the latest arrival\ntime that does not lead to the violation of the time windows of all successive vertices has\nbeen calculated in a preprocessing step). However, for a modified MPISP solution, we may\n13\nrequire up to O(nlogn) time to check its feasibility due to the re-computation of the shortest\ntransit times associated with the affected vertices, which will be elaborated in Section 5.4.1.\nThe pseudocode of our tabu search algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2, which is an\niterative approach that follows a four-phase framework: initialization, local search with\ntabu moves, ejection pool algorithm and perturbation. At the beginning of the algorithm,\nwe generate an initial solution S0 using the function best init (see Section 5.3) and then initialize both the best solution Sbest and the current solution S by S0. In each iteration, we first invoke the local search procedure with tabu moves (function local search, see Section 5.4) and set S ′ to be the best solution found by this procedure. Subsequently, we try to improve on S ′ by an ejection pool algorithm (function EPA, see Section 5.5) and then update\nSbest if possible. Finally, the search process is diversified by perturbing the best solution found in this iteration. The above process is repeated until the perturbation procedure\n(function perturb, see Section 5.6) is consecutively performed maxPerturbation times without\nimproving on Sbest."

The amount\nof workload is translated into time unit by expression (4), where wl(r) is the cumulative\nworkload in route r. If the inspector has enough capability to serve supplier u, namely wl(r) + du ≤ Q, then no workload penalty is incurred. Otherwise, the penalty, denoted by mvl(u, r), equals the length of the depot time window multiplied by the workload violation percentage.\nThe penalty for time-window violation, denoted by mvt(u, r), considers all possible insertions. For each vi ∈ r, we can easily find its earliest arrival time eavi when (0, v1, . . . , vi) is feasible, and its latest arrival time lavi that does not affect the feasibility of (vi+1, vi+2, . . . , v|r|, 0). Inserting u into r at the position immediately after vi creates a new route r ′, which may be infeasible. Under the condition that (0, v1, . . . , vi) is feasible, we can find the earliest arrival times at u and vi+1 in r ′, denoted by ea′u and ea ′ vi+1 , respectively. The partial route (0, v1, . . . , vi, u, vi+1) may be infeasible, i.e., ea ′ u > lu and/or ea ′ vi+1 > lvi+1 . Furthermore, we can also find the latest arrival time at u, denoted by la′u, that makes (vi+1, vi+2, . . . , v|r|, 0) feasible. The penalty for time-window violation incurred by inserting u between vi and vi+1 is calculated by summing up the violations of lu, eu and lavi+1 (see expression (5)). As shown in 16\nexpression (3), the cost of inserting u into r takes into account both mvl(u, r) and mvt(u, r) whose relative weights are controlled by a parameter η. After sorting the mv(u, S) values of\nall unserved suppliers in ascending order, we can obtain a sequence (mv1, . . . ,mv|U |), where |U | is the cardinality of U . The value of D(S) is calculated by ∑|U |\ni=1mvi/i. We believe that\nthe solution S with smaller D(S) has more chance to be improved by including the unserved\nsuppliers.\nThe third component F (S) is the summation of the maximal free times of all routes in S. The maximal free time of route r is defined as mft(r) = max0≤i≤|r|+1{lai − eai} and\naccordingly F (S) = ∑\nr∈Smft(r)."

After\nan Or-opt operation, we can also derive the time complexity for checking the feasibility\nof the resultant route, updating the earliest and latest arrival times at each supplier, and\ncomputing the fitness of the resultant solution in a manner similar to that used for the 2-opt\noperation.\nFigure 9 illustrates the 2-opt∗ operation which exchanges the latter subroutes of r1 and r2 by replacing edges (i, i+1) and (j, j+1) with edges (i, j+1) and (j, i+1).

In the latter case, we only need to check the feasibility of r′2 shown in Figure 10(c), which can be done in O(logn) time.

The feasibility of this route can be checked by calculating ea′i for all suppliers in subroute (j, i+ 1, . . . , j − 1, i, j + 1). The resultant routes created by exchanging two suppliers from two\ndifferent routes are shown in Figure 11(c). The feasibility check can be done in O(logn)\ntime.

      "text" : "The solutions generated by our tabu search algorithm are lower bounds to the MPISP.\nIn this section, we construct a constrained knapsack model to produce an upper bound for\nthe MPISP; this model is motivated by Lau et al. (2003).\n25\nThe time windows of all suppliers can be adjusted based on the following straightforward\nobservations. For a supplier i, if the opening time of its time window lies within period p, i.e., ap ≤ ei ≤ bp, and it is impossible to complete its service during that period, i.e., bp−ei < si, then the real earliest service starting time for supplier i should be the opening time ap+1 of the next period. Consequently, in this situation ei can be updated by ei = ap+1. Analogously, if ap ≤ li ≤ bp and bp − li < si, we can update li by li = bp − si. Let λi = ceil(li + si) + t̂i,0 denote the time of returning to the depot immediately after severing supplier i with the service starting time li. We construct a supplier set VG = {g1, g2, . . . , gm} ⊆ VC that contains m distinct suppliers satisfying λi ≥ λj for all i ∈ VG and j ∈ VC\\VG.\nObviously, if ei > li, supplier i cannot be served by any inspector and vertex i can only be used as a waypoint. We define f1(i) = 0 if ei > li and f1(i) = 1 otherwise. Suppose ei and li lie within periods p1 and p2, respectively. We define f2(i, p) = 1 if p1 ≤ p ≤ p2 and f2(i, p) = 0 otherwise, where f2(i, p) = 1 indicates that supplier i could probably be served during period p. Furthermore, we use f3(i, j) = 1 to indicate that it is possible for an inspector to serve both suppliers i and j when supplier time windows, workload capacity\nand working periods are not considered. Thus, the definition of f3(i, j) is:\nf3(i, j) =  1, if ei + si + ti,j ≤ lj or ej + sj + tj,i ≤ li;0, otherwise. We denote by rpi the time required to directly travel from supplier i to its nearest neighbor who could probably be served by the same inspector during period p. Define set V pi = {j ∈ V |j 6= i, f2(j, p) = 1, f3(i, j) = 1}. We set rpi = +∞ if V p i is empty, and otherwise rpi = minj∈Vi{ti,j}. Let xi,k,p be a binary decision variable that equals 1 if supplier i is served by inspector k during period p, and 0 otherwise. The optimal solution value of the following\n26\ninteger programming model gives an upper bound to the MPISP:\nmax ∑ i∈VC ∑ k∈K ∑ p∈P dixi,k,p (7)\ns.t. ∑ k∈K ∑ p∈P xi,k,p ≤ f1(i), ∀ i ∈ VC (8)\n∑ k∈K xi,k,p ≤ f2(i, p), ∀ i ∈ VC , p ∈ P (9)\n∑ p∈P (xi,k,p + xj,k,p) ≤ 1 + f3(i, j), ∀i, j ∈ VC , i 6= j, k ∈ K (10)\n∑ i∈VC ∑ p∈P dixi,k,p ≤ Q, ∀ k ∈ K (11)\n∑ i∈VC ∑ p∈P ( si + min{rpi , r p+1 i , . . . , r w i } ) xi,k,p + r 1 0 ≤ λgk , ∀ k ∈ K (12)\n∑ i∈VC xi,k,p(si + r p i )−max i∈VC rpi ≤ T, ∀ k ∈ K, p ∈ P (13) xi,k,p ∈ {0, 1}, ∀ i ∈ VC , k ∈ K, p ∈ P (14)\nThe objective (7) is to maximize the total completed workload. Constraints (8) state\nthat each supplier must be assigned to at most one inspector and be served in at most\none period. Constraints (9) guarantee that if supplier i cannot be served by any inspector\nduring period p, all relative variables must be set to zero. Constraints (10) ensure that if\nf3(i, j) = 0, suppliers i and j cannot be served by the same inspector. As the inspector workload capacity cannot be exceeded, Constraints (11) apply. When supplier i is served\nby some inspector, the time it consumes must be at least the sum of si and the traveling time to its nearest neighbor. Any feasible solution to the MPISP must have m routes, each\nof which has an earliest time of returning to the depot. It is easy to observe that the k-th\nlargest return time must be less than or equal to the k-th largest λgk . Obviously, the sum of si + min{rpi , r p+1 i , . . . , r w i } associated with all suppliers covered by a route should be less than or equal to the length of that route, which is capped by λgk . Therefore, Constraints (12) hold. After completing the service of supplier i, the inspector may stay at vertex i until the start of the next period. The difference between the total si + r p i of all suppliers served in each period and the largest rpi must be less than or equal to the period length, which is 27\nensured by Constraints (13).\nAny feasible solution to the MPISP must be also feasible to the constrained knapsack\nmodel (7) – (14). The knapsack problem and many of its variants have been well-studied\nand can be efficiently handled by several commercial mathematical programming solvers."

Since the MPISP is a new problem,\nthere is no existing algorithm tailored for it. As a consequence, we cannot compare our\ntabu search algorithm with other approaches. The test instances and computational results\nreported in this article can serve as benchmarks for future researchers on this problem.\nTheoretically speaking, the optimal solution value of some instance with w = d must be\ngreater than or equal to that of the same instance with w = kd, where k is an integral number.\nThis is because we can always construct a feasible solution to an instance with w = d from\nany solution to this instance with w = kd. For example, the optimal solution value of an\ninstance with w = 1 must be greater than those of this instance with w = 3 and w = 5.\nSince our tabu search algorithm is a stochastic approach, it is possible that the maximum\nworkload of some instance with w = 3 or w = 5 is larger than that of this instance with\nw = 1. Fortunately, we did not encounter such phenomenon in our experiments. However, 33\nwhen w2/w1 is not an integer, an instance with w2 may have larger optimal solution value than this instance with w1. For example, the optimal solution value of an instance with w = 5 may be larger than this instance with w = 3. In these tables, we can find several instances\nwith w = 3 have larger maximum workload than their counterparts with w = 5. Since these\nmaximum workloads may not be optimal, we cannot judge whether these phenomena were\nresulted from the randomness of the tabu search algorithm or the nature of the instances.\nObviously, for each instance with a certain w, the maximum workload increases as the\nnumber of vehicles.\nFor each instance group, we calculated the average of all “Ave. Time” and show the\nstatistical results in Table 8. From this table, we can observe that in most cases (those are\nnot marked in bold), the average computation times increase as the value of w.\n(b)"

      "heading" : "8. Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper introduces an inspector scheduling problem in which a set of inspectors are\ndispatched to complete a set of inspection requests at different locations in a multi-period\nplanning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the\ndepot but has to stay at one of the inspection locations for recuperation. We first studied\nthe way of computing the shortest transit time between any pair of locations when the\nworking time periods are considered. Next, we introduced several local search operators\nthat were adapted from classical VRPTW operators and integrated these adapted operators\nin a tabu search framework. Moreover, we presented a constrained knapsack model that is\nable to produce an upper bound for the MPISP. Finally, we evaluated the algorithm based\non 370 TOPTW instances and 672 MPISP instances. The experimental results reported in\nthis study show the effectiveness of our algorithm and can serve as benchmarks for future\nresearchers. Since the working time windows of the scheduling subjects and the use of\nwaypoint are very common considerations in practice, a possible research direction can\nfocus on studying the variants of other existing vehicle routing models that involves these\ntwo factors."

In the MPISP, each inspector is scheduled to perform a route in a given multi-period planning horizon. At the end of each period, each inspector is not required to return to the depot but has to stay at one of the vertices for recuperation. If the remaining time of the current period is insufficient for an inspector to travel from his/her current vertex A to a certain vertex B, he/she can choose either waiting at vertex A until the start of the next period or traveling to a vertex C that is closer to vertex B. Therefore, the shortest transit time between any vertex pair is affected by the length of the period and the departure time. We first describe an approach of computing the shortest transit time between any pair of vertices with an arbitrary departure time. To solve the MPISP, we then propose several local search operators adapted from classical operators for the VRPTW and integrate them into a tabu search framework. In addition, we present a constrained knapsack model that is able to produce an upper bound for the problem. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive experiments based on a set of test instances. Our computational results indicate that our approach generates high-quality solutions.",
