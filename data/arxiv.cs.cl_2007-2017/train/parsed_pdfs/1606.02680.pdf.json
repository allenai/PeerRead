      "text" : "Neural machine translation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) has become a major alternative to the widely used statistical phrase-based translation system (Koehn et al., 2003), evidenced by the successful entries in WMT’15 and WMT’16.\nPrevious work on using neural networks for Arabic translation has mainly focused on using neural networks to induce an additional feature for phrasebased statistical machine translation systems (see, e.g., (Devlin et al., 2014; Setiawan et al., 2015)). This hybrid approach has resulted in impressive improvement over other systems without any neural\nnetwork, which raises a hope that a fully neural translation system may achieve a even higher translation quality. We however found no prior work on applying a fully neural translation system (i.e., neural machine translation) to Arabic translation.\nIn this paper, our aim is therefore to present the first result on the Arabic translation using neural machine translation. On both directions (Ar→En and En→Ar), we extensively compare a vanilla attention-based neural machine translation system (Bahdanau et al., 2015) against a vanilla phrase-based system (Moses, (Koehn et al., 2003)), while varying pre-/post-processing routines, including morphology-aware tokenization and orthographic normalization, which were found to be crucial in Arabic translation (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Badr et al., 2008; El Kholy and Habash, 2012).\nThe experiment reveals that neural machine translation performs comparably to the standard phrasebased system. We further observe that the tokenization and normalization routines, initially proposed for phrase-based systems, equally improve the translation quality of neural machine translation. Finally, on the En→Ar task, we find the neural translation system to be more robust to the domain shift compared to the phrase-based system."

      "text" : "A major workforce behind neural machine translation is an attention-based encoder-decoder model (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2015). This attention-based encoder-decoder model consists of an encoder, decoder and attention mechanism. The encoder, which is often implemented as a bidirectional recurrent network, reads a source\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 68\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\nsentence X = (x1, . . . , xTx) and returns a set of context vectors C = (h1, . . . ,hTx).\nThe decoder is a recurrent language model. At each time t′, it computes the new hidden state by\nzt′ = φ(zt′−1, ỹt′−1, ct′),\nwhere φ is a recurrent activation function, and zt′−1 and ỹt′−1 are the previous hidden state and previously decoded target word respectively. ct′ is a time-dependent context vector and is a weighted sum of the context vectors returned by the encoder: ct′ = ∑Tx t=1 αtht, where the attention weight αt is computed by the attention mechanism fatt: αt ∝ exp(fatt(zt′−1, ỹt′−1,ht)). In this paper, we use a feedforward network with a single tanh hidden layers to implement fatt.\nGiven a new decoder state zt′ , the conditional distribution over the next target symbol is computed as\np(yt = w|ỹ<t, X) ∝ exp(gw(zt′)),\nwhere gw returns a score for the word w, and V is a target vocabulary.\nThe entire model, including the encoder, decoder and attention mechanism, is jointly tuned to maximize the conditional log-probability of a groundtruth translation given a source sentence using a training corpus of parallel sentence pairs. This learning process is efficiently done by stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation.\nSubword Symbols Sennrich et al. (2015), Chung et al. (2016) and Luong and Manning (2016) showed that the attention-based neural translation model can perform well when source and target sentences are represented as sequences of subword symbols such as characters or frequent character n-grams. This use of subword symbols elegantly addresses the issue of large target vocabulary in neural networks (Jean et al., 2014), and has become a de facto standard in neural machine translation. Therefore, in our experiments, we use character n-grams selected by byte pair encoding (Sennrich et al., 2015)."

      "text" : "Arabic exhibits a rich morphology. This makes Arabic challenging for natural language processing and\nmachine translation. For instance, a single Arabic token ‘ é J J. »Q ÖÏð’ (‘and to his vehicle’ in English) is\nformed by prepending ‘ ð’ (‘and’) and ‘ Ë’ (‘to’) to\nthe base lexeme ‘ é J. »QÓ’ (‘vehicle’), appending ‘ è’\n(‘his’) and replacing the feminine suffix ‘ è ’ (ta marbuta) of the base lexeme to ‘ H ’. This feature of Arabic is challenging, as (1) it increases the number of out-of-vocabulary tokens, (2) it consequently worsens the issue of data sparsity 1, and (3) it complicates the word-level correspondence between Arabic and another language in translation. This is often worsened by the orthographic ambiguity found in Arabic scripts, such as the inconsistency in spelling certain letters.\nPrevious work has thus proposed morphologyaware tokenization and orthographic normalization as two crucial components for building a high quality phrase-based machine translation system (or its variants) for Arabic (Habash and Sadat, 2006; Badr et al., 2008; El Kholy and Habash, 2012). These techniques have been found very effective in alleviating the issue of data sparsity and improving the generalization to tokens not included in a training corpus (in their original forms.)"

      "heading" : "3.2 Morphology-Aware Tokenization",
      "text" : "The goal of morphology-aware tokenization, or morpheme segmentation (Creutz and Lagus, 2005) is to split a word in its surface form into a sequence of linguistically sound sub-units. Contrary to simple string-based tokenization methods, morphologyaware tokenization relies on linguistic knowledge of a target language (Arabic in our case) and applies, for instance, various morphological or orthographic adjustments to the resulting sub-units.\nIn this paper, we investigate the tokenization scheme used in the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB, (Maamouri et al., 2004)) which was found to work well with phrase-based translation system in (El Kholy and Habash, 2012). This tokenization separates all clitics other than definite articles.\nWhen translating to Arabic, the decoded sequence of tokenized symbols must be de-tokenized. This detokenization step is not trivial, as it needs to undo any adjustment (implicitly) made by the tokenization algorithm. In this work, we follow the approach\n1see Sec. 5.2.1 of (Cho, 2015) for detailed discussion.\nproposed in (Badr et al., 2008; Salameh et al., 2015). This approach builds a lookup table from a training corpus and uses it for mapping a tokenized form back to its original form. When the tokenized form is missing in the lookup table, we back off to a number of hand-crafted de-tokenization rules."

      "text" : "Training Corpus We combine LDC2004T18, LDC2004T17 and LDC2007T08 to form a training parallel corpus. The combined corpus contains approximately 1.2M sentence pairs, with 33m tokens on the Arabic side. Most of the sentences are from news articles. We ignore sentence pairs which either side has more than 100 tokens.\nIn-Domain Evaluation Sets We use the evaluation sets from NIST 2004 (MT04) and 2005 (MT05) as development and test sets respectively. In Ar→En, we use all four English reference translations to measure the translation quality. We use only the first English sentence out of four as a source during En→Ar. Both of these sets are derived from news articles, just as the training corpus is.\nOut-of-Domain Evaluation Set In the case of En→Ar, we evaluate both phrase-based and neural translation systems on MEDAR evaluation set (Hamon and Choukri, 2011). This set has four Arabic references per English sentence. It is derived from web pages discussing climate changes, significantly differing from the training corpus. This set was selected to highlight the robustness to domain mismatch between training and test sets.\nWe verify the domain mismatches of the evaluation sets relative to the training corpus by fitting a 5-gram language model on the training corpus and computing the likelihoods of the evaluation sets, on the Arabic side. As can be seen in Table 1, the domain of the MEDAR is significantly further away\nfrom the training corpus than the others are.\nNote on MT04 and MT05 We noticed that a significant portion of Arabic sentences in MT04 and MT05 are found verbatim in the training corpus (172 on MT04 and 26 on MT05). In order to accurately measure the generalization performance, we removed those duplicates from the evaluation sets."

      "text" : "Phrase-based Machine Translation We use Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) to build a standard phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Word alignment was extracted by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), and we used phrases up to 8 words to build a phrase table. We use the following options for alignment symmetrization and reordering model: grow-diag-final-and and msd-bidirectionalfe. KenLM (Heafield et al., 2013) is used as a language model and trained on the target side of the training corpus.\nNeural machine translation We use a publicly available implementation of attention-based neural machine translation.2 For both directions–En→Ar and Ar→En–, the encoder is a bidirectional recurrent network with two layers of 512×2 gated recurrent units (GRU, (Cho et al., 2014)), and the decoder a unidirectional recurrent network with 512 GRU’s. Each model is trained for approximately seven days using Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) until the cost on the development set stops improving. We regularize each model by applying dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) to the output layer and penalizing the L2 norm of the parameters (coefficient 10−4). We use beam search with width set to 12 for decoding."

Note that ATB includes\n2 https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial\nNorm, and both of them include simple tokenization performed by MADAMIRA.\nEnglish We test simple tokenization (Tok), lowercasing (Lower) for En→Ar and truecasing (True, (Lita et al., 2003)) for Ar→En.\nByte pair encoding As mentioned earlier in Sec. 2, we use byte pair encoding (BPE) for neural machine translation. We apply BPE to the alreadytokenized training corpus to extract a vocabulary of up to 20k subword symbols. We use the publicly available script released by Sennrich et al. (2015)."

      "heading" : "5 Result and Analysis",
      "text" : "En→Ar From Table 2, we observe that the translation quality improves as a better preprocessing routine is used. By using the normalization as well as morphology-aware tokenization (Tok+Norm+ATB), the phrase-based and neural systems each achieve as much as +4.46 and +4.98 BLEU over the baselines, on MT05. The improvement is even more apparent on the MEDAR whose domain deviates from the training corpus, confirming that proper preprocessing of Arabic script indeed helps in handling word tokens that are not present in a training corpus.\nWe notice that the tested tokenization strategies have nearly identical effect on both the phrasebased and neural translation systems. The translation quality of either system is mostly effective by the tokenization strategy employed for Arabic, and is largely insensitive to whether source sentences in English were lowercased. This reflects well the complexity of Arabic scripts, compared to English, discussed earlier in Sec. 3.1.\nAnother important observation is that the neural translation system significantly outperforms the phrase-based one on the out-of-domain evaluation set (MEDAR), while they perform comparably to each other in the case of the in-domain evaluation set (MT05). We conjecture that this is due to the neural translation system’s superior generalization capability based on its use of continuous space representations. Ar→En In the last column of Table 2, we observe a trend similar to that from En→Ar. First, both phrase-based and neural machine translation benefit quite significantly from properly normalizing and tokenizing Arabic, while they are both less sensitive to truecasing English. The best translation quality using either model was achieved when all the tokenization methods were applied (Ar: Tok+Norm+ATB and En:Tok+True), improving upon the baseline by more than 2+ BLEU. Furthermore, we again observe that the phrase-based and neural translation systems perform comparably to each other."

We notice however that much of research on neural machine translation has focused on European languages despite its language agnostic nature. In this paper, we apply neural machine translation to the task of Arabic translation (Ar↔En) and compare it against a standard phrase-based translation system. We run extensive comparison using various configurations in preprocessing Arabic script and show that the phrase-based and neural translation systems perform comparably to each other and that proper preprocessing of Arabic script has a similar effect on both of the systems. We however observe that the neural machine translation significantly outperform the phrase-based system on an out-of-domain test set, making it attractive for real-world deployment.",
