The main drawback of kernel methods is that they require the user to specify a single suitable kernel in the first place, which is often critical to the method’s success, but is usually a hard task even when the user has a good familiarity with the problem domain. To ease this burden, significant attention has been given the problem of automatically learning the kernel. The majority of the previous work in this area has focused on the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) setting, where the user is only tasked with specifying a set of base kernels, and the learning algorithm is in charge of finding a combination of these base kernels that is appropriate for the problem at hand.\nThere have been two main lines of work in this direction. The first one learns both the the weights of the kernel combination and the parameters of the classifier by solving a single joint optimization problem. This one-stage approach was first proposed by (Lanckriet et al., 2004) and has since received significant attention (Rakotomamonjy et al., 2007; Sonnenburg et al., 2006; Cortes et al., 2010a; Kloft et al., 2011; Bach, 2008; Zien & Ong, 2007; Cortes et al., 2009; Sindhwani & Lozano, 2011).\nThe second line of work in kernel learning follows a two-stage approach: first learn a “good” combination of base kernels using the training data, then use the learned kernel with a standard kernel method such as SVM or kernel ridge regression to obtain a classifier/regressor. This approach has been initially proposed in (Cristianini et al., 2001) and (Kandola et al., 2002), and recently revisited by (Cortes et al., 2010b). The two-stage leaning approaches so far have been\nbased on the notion of target alignment. Intuitively, target alignment, is a measure of similarity (agreement) between a kernel and the target kernel, which is derived from the training labels, and represents the optimal kernel for the training sample.\nIn this paper we introduce TS-MKL, a general approach to Two-Stage Multiple Kernel Learning that encompasses the previous work based on target alignment as special cases. We formulate the kernel learning problem as a standard linear classification problem in a new instance space. In this space, any linear classifier with weights µ directly corresponds to a linear combination of base kernels with weights µ. To avoid confusions, we will denote this new instance space as the K-space, and a classifier in the K-space as a Kclassifier throughout the paper. Thus the problem of finding a “good” kernel combination reduces to finding a “good” linear classifier in the K-space, a very familiar problem. One big advantage of this approach is that one can easily adapt techniques from binary classification to solve the MKL problem. For instance, one can use familiar and well understood max-margin methods to obtain better performing MKL algorithms, or take advantage of the recent advances in large scale learning to scale up and/or parallelize the MKL implementations. For the results presented in this paper we learn K-classifiers (and hence kernels) by training L2 regularized linear SVMs with positive weights using the stochastic projected sub-gradient descent method from Pegasos (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007).\nOn the theoretical side, we prove a finite sample generalization bound for the original classification task in terms of the expected hinge loss and the margin of a K-classifier in the K-space. This justifies our approach of training a K-classifier that has low hinge loss and high margin in the K-space in order to learn a good kernel for the original classification problem. To the best of our knowledge, this result represent the first finite sample bound for two-stage kernel learning, improving on previous bounds that were only asymptotic. We also give a concentration bound for the expected hinge loss of a K-classifier.\nOn the empirical side, we run a comprehensive evaluation on two object recognition datasets (Caltech 101 and 256), three bioinformatics datasets (Psort+, Psort-, Plant) and four UCI datasets. On all these datasets our method performs better than, or the same as target alignment, showing that choosing a better K-classifier is beneficial. Our method also fares well against one-stage multiple kernel learning approaches significantly outperforming them on Caltech-256 and being essentially tied on the others."

      "text" : "We consider a classification problem where instances (x, y) are drawn from a distribution P over X × Y, with Y a finite discrete set of labels. We assume that we have access to p positive semi-definite (PSD) base kernel functions K1, · · · ,Kp with Ki : X × X → R. Our goal is to learn a combination of these kernel functions that is itself a positive semi-definite function and is a “good” kernel for the classification task at hand. To achieve this, we define a new binary classification problem over a new instance space {(zxx′ , tyy′)|((x, y), (x′, y′)) ∼ P × P} ⊂ Rp × {±1} where\nzxx′ = (K1(x, x ′), · · · ,Kp(x, x′)) tyy′ = 2 · 1{y = y′} − 1 (1)\nWe will call this space the K-space, and call zxx′ a Kexample or K-instance and tyy′ a K-label. Any function h : Rp → R in this space induces a similarity function K̃h between instances in the original space:\nK̃h(x, x ′) = h(zxx′) = h(K1(x, x ′), · · · ,Kp(x, x′))\nIf K̃h is also positive semi-definite, hence a valid kernel, we say that h is a K-classifier. For example, all linear functions with positive coefficients (i.e. hµ(zxx′) = µ · zxx′ with µ ≥ 0) are K-classifiers with the induced kernels K̃µ being linear combinations of the p base kernels. Figure 1 shows a toy example for the case of two base kernels. Each point in the figure is a labeled K-example (zxx′ , tyy′) corresponding to a pair (x, y), (x′, y′) of original instances. Note that the figure is drawn in K-space, not in input space. For a linear K-classifier hµ, the value of its induced kernel for a parir of original instances, K̃µ(x, x ′), is the projection of the corresponding K-example zxx′ on the vector µ (represented by the green line). The left and center sub-figures show the cases where µ is (0, 1) and (1, 0) respecively. In both cases the induced kernel combination is suboptimal. The linear combination in the right sub-figure corresponds to µ = (1, 1) and is a good combination because the kernel values of pairs of instances in the same class are separated from the kernel values of pairs of instances in different classes.\nThe key insight behind our method is that, if a Kclassifier h is a good classifier in the K-space, then\nthe induced kernel K̃h(x, x ′) = h(zxx′) will likely be positive when x and x′ belong to the same class and negative otherwise. This makes K̃h a good kernel for the original classification task. This intuition is made more precise in Section 3 where we provide a generalization bound that shows that a K-classifier that separates the positive and negative K-examples with high margin will indeed induce a kernel that allows learning a good classifier for the original task. Note that having a good K-classifier is a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. There can very well exist combinations of base kernels that do not correspond to a good K-classifier, but are good kernels nevertheless. Unlike one-stage kernel learning approaches, our method will not be able to find such combinations and it might miss on some good kernels. The results in Section 4, however, show that this does not seem to be the case in practice, as we consistently matched or exceeded the performance of one-stage MKL.\nThus the problem of learning a good kernel can be reduced to the problem of learning a good K-classifier in the newly defined K-space: given a training sample (xi, yi) n i=1 for the original classification task, construct a K-training set (zij , tij)1≤i≤j≤n and learn a Kclassifier h from this sample. Any learning algorithm can be used for learning h provided that the induced kernel can be guaranteed to be a valid PSD kernel1.\nIn line with the majority of the MKL work, in this paper we focus on learning linear K-classifiers, and hence linear combinations of base kernels. The results in Section 3 suggest that it is desirable to have a maximum margin K-classifier, thus we use L2 regularized linear SVM to learn the K-classifier, and ensure that the induced kernel is PSD by constraining the weights to be positive. One could, however, use a sparsity promoting regularizer (e.g., L1 penalty) if a sparse combination of kernels is desired.\nThe optimization problem for learning the kernel weights µ is thus given by\nmin µ≥0\nλ 2 ||µ||2 + 1(n\n2\n) + n ∑ 1≤i≤j≤n [1− tijµ · zij ]+ (2)\nwhere [1− s]+ = max{0, 1− s} is the hinge loss. To optimize this objective we use the stochastic projected sub-gradient descent implemented in Pega-\n1One could drop the PSD requirement and use any classifier, even a non-linear one, to obtain a similarity function rather than a proper kernel. The theory of learning with similarity functions (Balcan & Blum, 2006) can be then applied to learn a classifier for the original task. Generalization bounds similar to the ones in Section 3 would also hold for this case.\nsos (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007), with an additional projection to the non-negative constraint set after every gradient step. Using a stochastic optimization method allows us to scale very well despite the quadratic number of K-examples: computation time is not directly dependent on the number of instances, linear in the number of base kernels, and independent of the number of classes. If needed, memory usage can be reduced through streaming techniques or on the fly construction of the K-examples."

This is achieved by solving the optimization problem\nmax µ≥0\n〈 ∑p l=1 µlKl,K\n(t)〉 || ∑p l=1 µlKl||F , s.t. ||µ||2 = 1, (3)\nwhere A is the Gram matrix of kernel A on the training set, 〈A,B〉 = tr(ABT ) and ||A||2F = tr(AAT ).\nThe above optimization problem can be re-written in our terminology of K-examples as follows:\nmax µ≥0\nµT (∑\ntij=1 zij − ∑ tij=−1 zij ) √ µT (∑\n∀i,j zijz T ij\n) µ\n, s.t. ||µ||2 = 1\nWhen the base kernels are centered, as proposed in (Cortes et al., 2010b), the denominator represents the overall standard deviation of the projections of the K-examples on the vector µ. Hence target alignment attempts to find a projection direction µ that maximize the difference between the sums of the projections of the positive and negative K-examples, while minimizing the overall variance of the projected Kexamples. This is very similar to using Fisher-LDA in the K-space, with non-negativity constraints on µ. In fact, viewing target alignment from this perspective, makes it clear that it implicitly makes the assumption that the data is homoscedastic (the positive and negative K-examples have the same covariance), which might not be appropriate in real applications."

      "heading" : "2.2. Connection to Learning with Hyperkernels",
      "text" : "The approach proposed in this paper can also be cast in the framework of learning with hyperkernels (Ong et al., 2005) which provides a general recipe for kernel learning and includes Multiple Kernel Learning as a\nspecial case. It introduces the notions of kernel quality functional, a measure of “goodness” of a kernel that depends on the training data, and Hyper Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, an RKHS over kernel functions that defines the class of kernels that can be learned. Once the desired Hyper-RKHS and quality functional are specified, one has to solve a semi-definite program (SDP) to optimize the quality functional regularized by the norm induced by the Hyper-RKHS.\nWhen using an SVM as the K-classifier, TS-MKL can be put in the learning with hyperkernels framework by defining the Hyper-RKHS to be the set of non-negative linear combinations of base kernels, and the quality functional to be the hinge loss in K-space. Considering this specific setting has significant advantages: it enables the use of simple and well understood binary classification techniques to learn the kernel, it enables a theoretical analysis, and it allows a significantly more scalable implementation. Equally important, all these advantages do not seem to come at the cost of reduced performance, as we are still performing on par with or better than competing MKL techniques.\n3. Theoretical Results2\nIn this section we make the connection between the performance a K-classifier in the K-space and the performance on the original problem precise. This justifies the approach taken in this paper not only intuitively, but also from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we bound the generalization error of an SVM that uses the kernel induced by a K-classifier in terms of the expected hinge loss and the margin of the Kclassifier in the K-space:\nTheorem 3.1 Let P be a distribution on X × {±1}, zxx′ and tyy′ be as in Equation 1, h be a K-classifier, and R be a constant s.t. h(zxx) ≤ R2 ∀x ∈ X . Let\nHLh,γ = E((x,y),(x′,y′))∈P×P\nt[ 1− tyy ′h(zxx′)\nγ\n] + |\nbe the expected K-space hinge loss relative to margin γ of the K-classifier h. Then, with probability 1 − δ, a classifier f̂ with generalization error\nP(x,y)\nr yf̂(x) ≤ 0 z ≤ HLh,γ +O\n(√ R4 ln(1/δ)\nγ2n\n)\ncan be learned efficiently from a training sample of n instances drawn IID from P .\n2Due to lack of space, all proofs are included in the supplementary material.\nThe theorem follows from the two lemmas stated below. The first lemma shows that a K-classifier that has low expected hinge loss in the K-space will induce a “good” kernel. The second lemma shows that a good kernel allows for a classifier with low generalization error to be efficiently learned from a finite training sample. The following definition states formally what we mean by a good kernel (Srebro, 2007).3\nDefinition A kernel K is an ( , γ) good kernel in hinge loss with respect to a distribution P on X×{±1} if there exist a classifier w ∈ HK with ‖w‖HK = 1 s.t.\nE(x,y)\nt[ 1− y〈w, φ(x)〉\nγ\n] + | ≤\nwhere HK is the Hilbert space and φ(·) is the feature mapping corresponding to K.\nLemma 3.2 Let P , h, HLh,γ , R be as in Theorem 3.1. Then the K̃h is a (HLh,γ , γ R ) good kernel in hinge loss with respect to P .\nLemma 3.3 Let K be an ( , γ) good kernel in hinge loss, with K(x, x) ≤ R2 ∀x ∈ X . Let (xi, yi)ni=1 be an IID training sample, and f̂(x) = ŵ · φ(x) with\nŵ = arg min ||w||HK≤1\n1\nn n∑ i=1 [ 1− yiw · φ(xi) γ ] +\nbe a kernel classifier that minimizes the average hinge loss relative to γ on the training sample. Then, with probability at least 1− δ, we have:\nP(x,y)\nr yf̂(x) ≤ 0 z ≤ +O\n(√ R2 ln(1/δ)\nγ2n\n)\nLemma 3.3 follows directly from Theorem 21 in (Bartlett & Mendelson, 2002).\nNote that, unlike in the one-stage kernel learning case, the generalization bound in Theorem 3.1 is in terms of the expected hinge loss of the K-classifier not the training hinge loss. While we are hopeful a generalization bound for the classification problem in the K-space can be obtained, as of now it remains an open problem.\nWe can, however, prove a concentration bound for the expected hinge loss of a K-classifier. This is the analog of the concentration bounds for target alignment in (Cortes et al., 2010b; Cristianini et al., 2001).4\n3A kernel that does not satisfy this definition is not necessarily a “bad” kernel. We just can not make any formal statements with respect to its performance.\n4This is not a regular generalization bound as the Kclassifier is not allowed to depend on the IID sample.\nTheorem 3.4 Let P , h, HLh,γ , R be as in Theorem 3.1. Let (xi, yi) n i=1 be an IID sample distributed according to P . Then the following inequality holds with probability at least 1− δ\nHLh,γ ≤ 2 n(n− 1) ∑\n1≤i<j≤n\n[ 1− tijh(zij)\nγ\n] +\n+ √√√√2(1 + R2γ )2 ln 1/δ n"

We use a batch size of 100 for each sub-gradient computation and run 103 sub-gradient steps for UCI datasets and 105 for all others. Figure 2, plots the test data accuracy versus the number of gradient iterations on Caltech-101, showing that after 105 iterations the change in accuracy is minimal. For the bigger Caltech-256 there is also essentially no change after 105 iterations. We use subsampling to balance the positive and negative K-examples.\nTo select the parameter λ, we use a single 80%-20% random split of the Pegasos training set and search for the λ with the lowest validation hinge loss5. The search grid for λ is taken to be in the range of 100 to 10−8 dividing in each step by 4. A big advantage of this selection scheme for λ is that it is completely independent from the data classifier that will ultimately use the learned kernel. This keeps the setup simple and avoids intricate multi-level multi-dimensional validation schemes across the parameters of the data classifier and the K-classifier. Fig. 2, shows the hinge-loss in K-space, the accuracy of the K-classifier, and the accuracy of the data classifier that uses the learned kernel, as a function of λ. The plot shows a clear correlation between hinge loss in K-space and data accuracy with the learned kernel. The data accuracy increases when the hinge loss in K-space decreases and vice versa. This experiment provides further emprical evidence for our theoretical results that show that a good K-classifier (having low hinge loss in K-space) corresponds to a good learned kernel.\nAfter λ is selected, Pegasos is retrained on the full training set of K-examples. The obtained weight vector µ is then used to linearly combine the base kernels, and the SVM data classifier is trained using this learned kernel with C selected as described above."

This is probably because data is too scarce to allow learning a separate kernel for each class. Target alignment performs a little better than the average kernel, but is still significantly worse than TS-MKL.

In this context, the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) problem of finding a combination of prespecified base kernels that is suitable for the task at hand has received significant attention from researchers. In this paper we show that Multiple Kernel Learning can be framed as a standard binary classification problem with additional constraints that ensure the positive definiteness of the learned kernel. Framing MKL in this way has the distinct advantage that it makes it easy to leverage the extensive research in binary classification to develop better performing and more scalable MKL algorithms that are conceptually simpler, and, arguably, more accessible to practitioners. Experiments on nine data sets from different domains show that, despite its simplicity, the proposed technique compares favorably with current leading MKL approaches.",
