      "text" : "Word embedding, which refers to low-dimensional dense vector representations of natural words, has demonstrated its power in many natural language processing tasks. However, it may suffer from the inaccurate and incomplete information contained in the free text corpus as training data. To tackle this challenge, there have been quite a few works that leverage knowledge graphs as an additional information source to improve the quality of word embedding. Although these works have achieved certain success, they have neglected some important facts about knowledge graphs: (i) many relationships in knowledge graphs are many-to-one, oneto-many or even many-to-many, rather than simply one-to-one; (ii) most head entities and tail entities in knowledge graphs come from very different semantic spaces. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm named ProjectNet. ProjecNet models the relationships between head and tail entities after transforming them with different low-rank projection matrices. The low-rank projection can allow non one-to-one relationships between entities, while different projection matrices for head and tail entities allow them to originate in different semantic spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that ProjectNet yields more accurate word embedding than previous works, thus leads to clear improvements in various natural language processing tasks."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "In recent years, the research on word embedding (or distributed word representations) has made promising progresses in many natural language processing tasks [1; 7; 11; 15; 16; 18]. Different from traditional one-hot discrete representations of words, word embedding vectors are dense, continuous, and low-dimensional. They are usually trained with neural networks on a large-scale free text corpus, such as Wikipedia, news articles, and web pages, in an unsupervised manner.\nWhile word embedding has demonstrated its power in many circumstances, it is gradually recognized that conven-\ntional word embedding techniques may suffer from the incomplete and inaccurate information contained in the free text data. On one hand, due to the restrictive topics and coverage of a text corpus, some words might not have sufficient contexts and therefore might not have reliable word embeddings. On the other hand, even if a word has sufficient contextual data, the free texts might be inaccurate, thus might not provide a semantically precise view of the word. As a result, the learned word embedding might be unable to carry on the desirable semantic information. To tackle this problem, recently some researchers have proposed to leverage knowledge graphs, such as WordNet [17] and Freebase [3], as additional data sources to improve word embedding [2; 21; 23].\nA knowledge graph contains a set of nodes representing entities and a set of edges corresponding to the relationships between entities. In other words, a knowledge graph can be regarded as a set of triples (h, r, t), where head entity h and tail entity t share the relationship r. In [23; 21], in addition to the original likelihood loss on the free texts, an extra loss function is imposed to capture the relationships in the knowledge graph. Specifically, the additional loss takes the form LK = ∑ (h,r,t) ||h+ r− t|| 2 2, where h, t are the embedding vectors of the words (entities) h and t respectively, and r is the embedding of the relationship r.1 Then the embeddings are learned by minimizing the overall loss on both free text and knowledge graph.\nWhile the above approaches have shown certain success, we would like to point out their limitations.\nFirst, the loss function LK in these works cannot capture complex relationships between entities. In particular, it will encounter problem when the relationships are one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many. For example, r =“cause of death” is a many-to-one relationship, since many different head entities hi (e.g., h1 = “Abraham Lincoln” and h2 = “John F Kennedy”) correspond to the same tail entity (e.g., t =“assassination by firearm”). In this case, the minimization of LK will enforce the embedding vectors of all head entities (e.g., h1, h2) to approach each other, which is clearly unreasonable.\nActually such kind of complex relationships are very com-\n1Please note that throughout the paper we will use bold characters to represent the embedding vectors for corresponding items.\nmon in knowledge graphs. Take a widely used benchmark dataset FB13 [19], which is a subset of Freebase, as an instance. For every relationship in FB13, we calculate the average number of head entities corresponding to one tail entity and the average number of tail entities corresponding to one head entity. Then we obtain the means and standard deviations of such values under different relationships. The overall statistical information is listed in Table 1, from which we can see that relationships in FB13 are highly non one-to-one, especially for the mapping from tail entity to head entity, as shown by the large mean value of #Head per Tail. In addition, the standard deviation for #Head per Tail is fairly large, indicating that the degrees of non one-to-one mappings from tail entity to head entity vary drastically across different relationships. This clearly shows that the issue is very serious and we should tackle it in order to learn a reasonable word embedding.\nSecond, the loss function LK adopts simple arithmetic operations on the embedding vectors of the head and tail entities, implying that both entities are located in the same space. However, the fact is that head entities are usually more concrete and tail entities are more abstract, making it unreasonable to simply regard them as in a homogeneous space. Still use the above example, for the relationship r =“cause of death”, all the head entities are real human names whereas all the tail entities are abstract reasons of death. What’s more, according to Table 1, head and tail entities are not symmetric from the statistics perspective: the number of tail entities per head entity is much smaller than that of head entities per tail entity, further indicating the heterogeneity nature of head and tail entities and suggesting that we should treat them separately in the mathematical modeling.\nIn the literature, there are some research works that try to resolve one of the aforementioned issues, however, as far as we know, none of the works successfully addressed both issues. For example, in [22], it is proposed to project the embedding vectors of both entities onto a relation-dependent hyperplane before computing the loss function LK. However, the heterogeneity between head and tail entities is not considered. Furthermore, the projection matrix used in [22] has a fixed rank for all types of relationships, which could not express various degrees of non one-to-one mappings. In [5], different transformations are adopted to head and tail entities respectively, however, no consideration is taken to address the issue of non one-to-one mappings.\nTo address the limitations of existing works, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm called ProjectNet, which adopts different and carefully designed projections to the head and tail entities respectively when defining the loss function LK. First, we show that the necessary condition to resolve the issue of non one-to-one mapping is to ensure the projection matrix to be low-rank. In such a way, we can guarantee the trans-\nlation distance between the entities to be small after projection without forcing their embedding vectors to be the same. Actually, it can be proven that the TransH model in [22] is our special case in the sense that it also adopts a projection matrix of low (and fixed) rank. Our model is more general since we can explicitly control the rank of the projection matrix, so as to adapt to knowledge graphs with different degrees of non one-to-one mappings. Second, by using different projection matrices for head and tail entities respectively, we can avoid the homogeneity assumption on the semantic space and therefore build a more flexible and accurate model. For example, for the knowledge graph FB13, we should adopt a low-rank projection matrix for head entities since the number of head entities is very large for each tail entity; however, it is safe to use a relatively full rank projection matrix for tail entities since the number of tail entities is rather small for each head entity.\nWe have tested the performance of our proposed algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposal can significantly outperform the baseline methods. This indicates the benefit of carefully modeling entities and relationships when incorporating knowledge graphs into the learning process of word embedding.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as following. In Section 2, we summarize related works in leveraging knowledge graph to help word embedding. Then in Section 3, the detailed model is introduced and its difference with related methods is illustrated. After that, the experimental settings and results are reported in Section 4. The paper is finally concluded in Section 5."

      "text" : "Word embeddings, (a.k.a. distributed word representations) are usually trained with neural networks by maximizing the likelihood of a text corpus. Based on several pioneering efforts [1; 7; 20], the research works in this field have grown rapidly in recent years [11; 15; 16; 18; 6]. Among them, word2vec [15; 16] draws quite a lot of attention from the community due to its simplicity and effectiveness. An interesting result given by word2vec is that the word embedding vectors it produces can reflect human knowledge via some simple arithmetic operations, e.g., v(Japan) − v(Tokyo) ≈ v(France)− v(Pairs).\nHowever, as aforementioned, word embedding models like word2vec usually suffer from the incompleteness and inaccuracy of the free-text training corpus. To address this challenge, there are some attempts that leverage additional structured or unstructured human knowledge to enhance word embeddings. Here are some examples. In [14; 8], the authors adopted morphological knowledge to aid the learning of rare words and new words. In [24], the authors used semantic relational knowledge between words as a constraint in learning word embedding vectors. In [23], the authors leveraged knowledge graphs, the most widely used structured knowledge, to help improve word representations. In particular, the authors did not only minimize the loss on the text corpus, but also minimized the loss on the knowledge graph by sharing embedding vectors between words and entities. In\n[21], the authors proposed a very similar method to [23], but with a different objective of improving knowledge graph understanding with the help of text corpus. Actually, both the models in [23] and [21] are inspired by the TransE model [4], which is a state-of-the-art work in the literature of computing distributed representations for knowledge graphs [5; 12; 19]. In TransE, the relational operation between entities h, t with relationship r is assumed to be a simple linear translation, i.e., min ||h + r − t||22. However, as pointed out in the introduction, such a simple formulation cannot handle the non one-to-one mappings between entities. To tackle the problem, in [22], the authors proposed a simple projection method named TransH. We will review the detailed mathematical forms of these models in Section 3.3 and discuss their relationship with our proposal."

Instead, it would be better to adopt different projection matrices, denoted as Lr ∈ Rd×d and Rr ∈ Rd×d respectively, to the head and tail entities. Hence, given a triple (h, r, t), the original embedding vectors for h and t will be transformed to h′ and t′ as follows,\nh′ = Lrh, t ′ = Rrt.

It is easy to obtain that the optimal solution h∗ satisfies the following linear system:\nLTr Lrh ∗ = LTr c. (7)\nTo avoid the non one-to-one mapping problem, the above equation must have multiple solutions. Then it is necessary that LTr Lr is a low-rank matrix. In addition, as rank(LTr Lr) = rank(Lr), the linear projection matrix Lr must not be full-rank either. The same conclusion holds for the projection matrix Rr for the tail entity.\nGiven the above proposition, we use the following tricks to ensure that Lr and Rr are low-rank matrices (whose ranks are mL and mR respectively, with mL < d and mR < d):\nLr =\nmL∑\ni=1\nµ(i)r p (i) r q(i) r T , Rr =\nmR∑\ni=1\nζ(i)r o (i) r s(i) r\nT , (8)\nwhere µ(i)r , ζ (i) r are scalars, and p (i) r , q (i) r , o (i) r , s (i) r are all d-dimensional real vectors, the outer products of which con-\nstitute (mL + mR) rank 1 matrices p (i) r q (i) r\nT\nand o(i)r s (i) r\nT\n. For simplicity, we set the rank of all the left matrices Lr to be the same (mL) and the rank of all the right matrices Rr to be the same (mR). Please note we can also specify different ranks for different relationships r. We leave the corresponding discussions to the future work."

      "heading" : "3.3 Discussions",
      "text" : "In this section, we discuss the connections of our proposed ProjectNet algorithm with a few previous works and show that they are special cases of ProjectNet.\nRNet. RNet refers to the knowledge models proposed in [23] and [21]. In fact, both models in the two works try to minimize the same scoring function: fd(h, r, t) = ||h + r − t||22. Their only difference lies in how fd is minimized. In [23], a large margin ranking loss is adopted for the minimization of fd(h, r, t), whereas in [21], an approximate softmax loss is used. It is clear that such a scoring function fd(h, r, t) cannot handle either the non one-to-one relationships between entities or the heterogeneity between head and tail entities. To state it more formally, let us consider the relationship triples (hi, r, t), i ∈ 1, · · · , N , where all head entities hi have the same relationship r with tail entity t. In the ideal case, if all fd(hi, r, t) are fully minimized, we will have hi = t − r, ∀i ∈ 1, · · · , N , which implies that h1 = h2 = · · · = hN. It means that all the embedding vectors for the head entities {hi}Ni=1 are the same, which is clearly unreasonable. We may encounter similar issues for one-to-many relationships {(h, r, tj)}j and many-to-many relationships {(hi, r, tj)}i,j .\nNote that RNet corresponds to Lr = Rr = Id×d in (3) and since the identity matrix Id×d can be written in the form of (8), RNet can be regarded as a special case of ProjectNet.\nTransH. TransH [22] is proposed to overcome the non oneto-one mapping problem. It first projects the entity embedding vectors h and t onto a hyperplane w.r.t the relationship r, and then the projected vectors h⊥ and t⊥ are used to define the scoring function fd. Specifically,\nh⊥ = h−wr T hwr, t⊥ = t−wr T twr,\nfd(h, r, t) = ||h⊥ + r− t⊥|| 2 2,\n(9)\nwhere wr ∈ Rd is the normal vector of the hyperplane with unit length (i.e., wr · r = 0 and ||wr||2 = 1).\nOur proposed ProjectNet model differs from TransH in two ways: (i) we adopt different projections to head and tail entities; (ii) we adopt general projection matrices rather than a hyperplane based projection. Actually, TransH (9) can be regarded as a special case of ProjectNet (5), as shown below. Starting from (9), we have\nh⊥ = h−wr Thwr = h−wrwr Th = (I −wrwr T )h.\n(10) Hence, by substituting Lr = (I −wrwrT ) in (3)(4), we get TransH. We still need to check whether Lr = (I −wrwrT ) can be written in the form of (8), i.e., the weighted sum of\nmL rank-1 matrices, where mL < d. We answer this question in the following two steps: (i) As Lr = (I − wrwrT ) is an idempotent matrix (i.e. LrLr = Lr) and wr is a unit length vector, it holds that rank(Lr) = trace(Lr) = d − 1 [10]. Therefore, Lr has d − 1 non-zero eigenvalues. Furthermore, by observing that the eigenvalues of wrwrT are 0 and 1, we can conclude that Lr = (I − wrwrT ) has 1 as one of its eigenvalues, corresponding to d − 1 linearly independent eigenvectors, and 0 as its another eigenvalue, corresponding to one eigenvector. (ii) Further considering that Lr is a real symmetric matrix, we can decompose Lr as Lr = UrΣrU T r , where Ur = (u (1) r ,u (2) r , · · · ,u (d) r ) ∈ Rd×d and Σr = diag(1, 1, · · · , 1, 0) ∈ Rd×d. The first d − 1 columns {u(i)r }d−1i=1 of Ur are all the unit-length eigenvectors of Lr corresponding to eigenvalue 1 and Σr stores all the eigenvalues of Lr. Thus we can write Lr = ∑d−1 i=1 u (i) r u (i) r T\n. The same procedure holds for the relation betweenRrt and t⊥. Then according to the above discussions, we can obtain the following proposition. Proposition 3.2 In the knowledge model of ProjectNet (8)(4), letting mL = mR = d − 1, µ (i) r = ζ (i) r = 1 and p(i)r = q (i) r = o (i) r = s (i) r = u (i) r , where u (i) r is the ith eigenvector of the matrix I − wrwrT with unit length, i = 1, 2, · · · , d− 1, we can obtain the TransH model (9).\nSE. SE [5] adopts the following scoring function: fd(h, r, t) = ||Lrh−Rrt||1. (11)\nSE looks very similar to our proposed knowledge model. However, there is a key difference: SE does not add the lowrank constraints to the matrices Lr and Rr. In other words, they fix the rank of these two matrices to be full, while in our model the rank of the matrices is a variable. Therefore our model is more general than SE and can handle the non one-to-one relationship when the rank is low while SE cannot since its rank is always full. In this sense, we could also regard SE as a special case of our proposed ProjectNet model.\nTransR. [13] TransR treats relationships and entities as different objects and thus separates their embeddings into different spaces,\nfd(h, r, t) = ||Mrh+ r−Mrt|| 2 2. (12)\nDifferent with our formulation (8)(5), they did not add the low-rank constraint to matrix Mr (or we say that it sets the matrix Mr to be full-rank). In addition, TransR adopts the same transformation matrices to head and tail entities, by assuming that they are located in the same space. Therefore, the knowledge model in our ProjectNet algorithm is more general than TransR, and can include it as our special case."

It consists of several quadruple word questions a:b,c:d, in which the relationship between word a and b is the same as that between c and d. For instance, (a : b, c : d) = (Berlin : Germany, Paris : France) and the relationship r is capital-countries. The task aims to infer word d given words a, b, and c using their word embedding vectors. To be more concrete, the inferred word d̂ is given by d̂ = argmaxw∈V cosine(b − a + c,w). Once d̂ = d, the result on this quadruple word question is right; otherwise, it is wrong.\n3As aforementioned, the models in the two papers differ only in the loss function (i.e., ranking loss vs. approximate softmax loss). Hence, we unify these two models using the name RNet and report the better performance of the two loss functions.\nTo construct the test set for the analogical reasoning task, we randomly sampled 1% triples from FB13, and filtered them according to the dictionary of enwik9.4 This test set consists of about 20k questions belonging to 7 non one-toone relationships. The detailed statistics for this test dataset can be found in Table 2.\nThen, we went through the remaining triples in FB13 and removed all those triples containing overlapped entities with the test data. In this way, we obtained a training set with roughly 76k triples, which has no overlap with the test set in either relationship triples or entities. The goal of doing so is to examine whether the free text corpus can act as a bridge between known and unknown entities, so as to verify the necessity of jointly embedding text and knowledge into the distributed representation space.\nFor ProjectNet, as we imposed Lra − Rrb = −r = Lrc − Rrd instead of a − b = c − d, we took a twostep approach instead of directly using the original word vectors to perform the analogical reasoning task: (i) we chose an optimal relationship r∗ that best describes the relationship between a and b, i.e., r∗ = argminr ||Lra + r − Rrb||22; (ii) under r∗, we chose the answer word d̂ according to d̂ = argminw∈V ||Lr∗c + r ∗ − Rr∗w|| 2 2.

For ProjectNet and SG+TransH, the word embedding vectors were directly used to compute the similarity scores, which is different from the analogical reasoning task. This is because there is no explicit relationship available in the evaluation process. The best performances of ProjectNet on the three datasets were obtained with the parameters setting to (mL = 50,mR = 95, α = 0.05), (mL = 40,mR = 90, α = 0.01), and (mL =\n60,mR = 95, α = 0.05) respectively. Table 3 reveals that ProjetNet achieves the best performance on all the datasets, which further indicates that ProjetNet produce higher quality word embedding vectors than the baseline methods."

      "text" : "In this paper we proposed a novel word embedding algorithm called ProjetNet, which leverages knowledge graphs to improve the quality of word embedding. In ProjetNet, we adopt different asymmetric low rank projections to head and tail entities in an entity-relationship triple, thus successfully maintain both non one-to-one mapping and heterogenous head/tail entities properties of knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that ProjetNet significantly outperforms previous embedding models.\nFor the future work, we plan to apply the proposed approach to fulfill knowledge mining tasks, such as triplet classification and link prediction [22]. In addition, we plan to use the word embedding vectors generated by ProjectNet in some real-world applications such as document classification and web search ranking."

However, it may suffer from the inaccurate and incomplete information contained in the free text corpus as training data. To tackle this challenge, there have been quite a few works that leverage knowledge graphs as an additional information source to improve the quality of word embedding. Although these works have achieved certain success, they have neglected some important facts about knowledge graphs: (i) many relationships in knowledge graphs are many-to-one, oneto-many or even many-to-many, rather than simply one-to-one; (ii) most head entities and tail entities in knowledge graphs come from very different semantic spaces. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm named ProjectNet. ProjecNet models the relationships between head and tail entities after transforming them with different low-rank projection matrices. The low-rank projection can allow non one-to-one relationships between entities, while different projection matrices for head and tail entities allow them to originate in different semantic spaces. The experimental results demonstrate that ProjectNet yields more accurate word embedding than previous works, thus leads to clear improvements in various natural language processing tasks.",
