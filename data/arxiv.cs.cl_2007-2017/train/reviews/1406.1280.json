Grapheme to phoneme (G2P) conversion modules, in literature, are usually rule based and work best for non-proper names in a particular language. Proper names are foreign to a G2P module. We follow an optimization approach to enable automatic construction of proper names pronunciation lexicon. The idea is to construct a small orthogonal set of words (basis) which can span the set of names in a given database. We propose two algorithms for the construction of this basis. The transcription lexicon of all the proper names in a database can be produced by the manual transcription of only the small set of basis words. We first construct a cost function and show that the minimization of the cost function results in a basis. We derive conditions for convergence of this cost function and validate them experimentally on a very large proper name database. Experiments show the transcription can be achieved by transcribing a set of small number of basis words. The algorithms proposed are generic and independent of language; however performance is better if the proper names have same origin, namely, same language or geographical region.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 07:07:44 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1280v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sunil kumar kopparapu", "m laxminarayana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1280"}
