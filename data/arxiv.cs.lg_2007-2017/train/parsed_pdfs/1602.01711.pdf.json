      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Time series classification (TSC) problems are differentiated from traditional classification problems because the attributes are ordered. Whether the ordering is by time or not is in fact irrelevant. The important characteristic is that there may be discriminatory features dependent on the ordering. The introduction of the UCR time series classification and clustering repository [21] saw a rapid growth in the number of publications proposing time series classification algorithms. Prior to the summer of 2015 over 1,200 people have downloaded the UCR archive and it has been referenced several hundred times. The repository has contributed to increasing the quality of evaluation of new TSC algorithms. Most experiments involve evaluation on over forty data sets, often with correct significance testing and most authors release source code. This degree of evaluation and reproducibility is generally better than most areas of machine learning and data mining research.\nHowever, there are still some fundamental problems with published TSC research that we aim to address. Firstly, nearly all evaluations are performed on a single train/test split. This can lead to over interpreting of results. The majority of machine learning research involves repeated resamples of the data, and we think TSC researchers should follow suit. To illustrate why, consider the following anecdote. We were recently contacted by a researcher who queried our published results for one nearest neighbour (1-NN) dynamic time warping (DTW) on the UCR train test splits. When comparing our accuracy results to theirs, they noticed that in some instances they differed by as much as 6%. Over all the problems there was no significant difference, but clearly we were concerned, as it is a deterministic algorithm. On further investigation, we found out that our data were rounded to six decimal places, there’s to eight. These differences on single splits were caused by small data set sizes and tiny numerical differences. When resampling, there were no significant difference on individual problems when using 6 or 8 decimal places.\nSecondly, there are some anomalies and discrepancies in the\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n01 71\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nF eb\nUCR data that can bias results. Not all of the data are normalised (e.g. Coffee) and some have been normalised incorrectly (e.g. ECG200). This can make algorithms look better than they really are. For example, most authors cite an error of 17.9% for the Coffee data with 1-NN DTW, and most algorithms easily achieve lower error. However, 17.9% error is for DTW on the non-normalised data. If it is normalised, 1-NN DTW has 0% error, a somewhat harder benchmark to beat. ECG200 has been incorrectly formatted so that the sum of squares of the series can classify the data perfectly. If a classifier uses this feature it should be completely accurate. This will be a further source of bias.\nThirdly, the more frequently a fixed set of problems is used, the greater the danger of overfitting and detecting significant improvement that does not generalise to new problems. We should be constantly seeking new problems and enhancing the repository with new data. This is the only real route to detecting genuine improvement in classifier performance.\nFinally, whilst the release of source code is admirable, the fact there is no common framework means it is often very hard to actually use other peoples code. We have reviewed algorithms written in C, C++, Java, Matlab, R and python. Often the code is“research grade”, i.e. designed to achieve the task with little thought to reusability or comprehensibility. There is also the tendency to not provide code that performs model selection, which can lead to suspicions that parameters were selected to minimize test error, thus biasing the results.\nTo address these problems we have implemented 20 different TSC algorithms in Java, integrated with the WEKA toolkit [17]. We have applied the following guidelines for the inclusion of an algorithm. Firstly, the algorithm must have been recently published in a high impact conference or journal. Secondly, it must have been evaluated on some subset of the UCR data. Thirdly, source code must be available. Finally, it must be feasible/within our ability to implement the algorithm in Java. This last criteria lead us to exclude at least two good candidates, described in Section 2.7. Often, variants of a classifier are described within the same publication. We have limited each paper to one algorithm and taken the version we consider most representative of the key idea behind the approach.\nWe have conducted experiments with these algorithms and standard WEKA classifiers on 100 resamples of every data set (each of which is normalised), including the 40 new data sets we have introduced into the archive. In addition to resampling the data sets, we have also conducted extensive model selection for many of the classifiers. Full details of our experimental regime are given in Section 3.\nThis is one of the largest ever experimental studies conducted in machine learning. We have performed millions of experiments distributed over thousands of nodes of a large high performance computing facility. Nevertheless, the goal of the study is tightly focussed and limited. This is meant to act as a springboard for further investigation into a wide range of TSC problems we do not address. Specifically, we assume all series in a problem are equal length, real valued and have no missing values. Classification is offline, and we assume the cases are independent (i.e. we do not per-\nform streaming classification). All series are labelled and all problems involve learning the labels of univariate time series. We are interested in testing hypotheses about the average accuracy of classifiers over a large set of problems. Algorithm efficiency and scalability are of secondary interest at this point. Detecting whether a classifier is on average more accurate than another is only part of the story. Ideally, we would like to know a priori which classifier is better for a class of problem or even be able to detect which is best for a specific data set. However, this is beyond the scope of this project.\nOur findings are surprising, and a little embarrassing, for two reasons. Firstly, many of the algorithms are in fact no better than our two benchmark classifiers, 1-NN DTW and Rotation Forest. Secondly, of those 8 significantly better than both benchmarks, by far the best classifier is COTE [2], an algorithm we proposed. It is on average over 8% more accurate than either benchmark. Whilst gratifying for us, we fear that this outcome may cause some to question the validity of the study. We have made every effort to faithfully reproduce all algorithms. We have tried to reproduce published results, with varying degrees of success (as described below), and have consulted authors on the implementation where possible. Our results are reproducable, and we welcome all input on improving the code base. We must stress that COTE is by no means the final solution. All of the algorithms we describe may have utility in specific domains, and many are orders of magnitudes faster than COTE. Nevertheless, we believe that it is the responsibility of the designers of an algorithm to demonstrate its worth. We think our benchmarking results will help facilitate an improved understanding of utility of new algorithms under alternative scenarios.\nAll of the code is freely accessible from a repository [7] and detailed results and data sets are available from a dedicated website [1].\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we review the algorithms we have implemented. In Section 3 we describe the data, code structure and experimental design. In Section 4 we present and analyse the results, and in Section 5 we summarise our findings and discuss the future direction."

      "text" : "We denote a vector in bold and a matrix in capital bold. A case/instance is a pair {x, y} with m observations x1, . . . , xm (the time series) and discrete class variable y with c possible values. A list of n cases with associated class labels is T =< X,y >=< (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) >. A classifier is a function or mapping from the space of possible inputs to a probability distribution over the class variable values.\nThe large majority of time series research in the field of data mining has concentrated on alternative distance measures that can be used for clustering, query and classification. For TSC, these distance measures are almost exculsively evaluated using with a one nearest neighbour (1-NN) classifier. The standard benchmark distance measures are Euclidean distance (ED) and dynamic time warping (DTW). Alternative techniques taken from other fields include edit distance with real penalty (ERP) and longest common subsequence (LCSS). Three more recently proposed time domain distance\nmeasures are described in Section 2.1.\nDTW is by far the most popular benchmark. Suppose we want to measure the distance between two series, a = {a1, a2, . . . , am} and b = {b1, b2, . . . , bm}. Let M(a,b) be the m×m pointwise distance matrix between a and b, where Mi,j = (ai − bj)2. A warping path\nP =< (e1, f1), (e2, f2), . . . , (es, fs) >\nis a set of points (i.e. pairs of indexes) that define a traversal of matrix M . So, for example, the Euclidean distance dE(a,b) = ∑m i=1(ai − bi)\n2 is the path along the diagonal of M .\nA valid warping path must satisfy the conditions (e1, f1) = (1, 1) and (es, fs) = (m,m) and that 0 ≤ ei+1 − ei ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ fi+1 − fi ≤ 1 for all i < m.\nThe DTW distance between series is the path through M that minimizes the total distance, subject to constraints on the amount of warping allowed. Let pi = Maei ,bfi be the distance between elements at position ei of a and at position fi of b for the i\nth pair of points in a proposed warping path P . The distance for any path P is\nDP (a,b) = s∑ i=1 pi.\nIf P is the space of all possible paths, the DTW path P ∗ is the path that has the minimum distance, i.e.\nP ∗ = min P∈P (DP (a,b)).\nThe optimal path P ∗ can be found exactly through a dynamic programming formulation. This can be a time consuming operation, and it is common to put a restriction on the amount of warping allowed. This restriction is equivalent to putting a maximum allowable distance between any pairs of indexes in a proposed path. If the warping window, r, is the proportion of warping allowed, then the optimal path is constrained so that\n|ei − fi| ≤ r ·m ∀(ei, fi) ∈ P ∗.\nIt has been shown that setting r through cross validation to maximize training accuracy, as proposed in [28], significantly increases accuracy [24]."

MCB finds the disretising break points as a preprocessing step by estimating the distribution of the Fourier coefficients. This is performed by segmenting the series, performing a DFT, then finding breakpoints for each coefficient so that each bin contains the same number of elements.

Specifically, for each possible shapelet length, a dictionary of SAX words is first formed. The dimensionality of the SAX dictionary is reduced through masking randomly selected letters (random projection). Multiple random projections are performed, and a frequency count histogram is built for each class.

Rodriguez et al.

Each member of the ensemble is given √ m intervals. A classification tree that has two bespoke characteristics is defined. Firstly, rather than evaluate all possible split points to find the best information gain, a fixed number of evaluation points is pre-defined. We assume this\nis an expedient to make the classifier faster, as it removes the need to sort the cases by each attribute value. Secondly, a refined splitting criteria to choose between features with equal information gain is introduced. This is defined as the distance between the splitting margin and the closest case. The intuition behind the idea is that if two splits have equal entropy gain, then the split that is furthest from the nearest case should be preferred. This measure would have no value if all possible intervals were evaluated because by definition the split points are taken as equi-distant between cases. We experimented with including these two features, but found the effect on accuracy was, if anything, negative. We found the computational overhead of evaluating all split points acceptable, hence we had no need to include the margin based tie breaker. Training a single tree involves selecting √ m random intervals, generating the mean, standard deviation and slope of the random intervals then creating and training a tree on the resulting 3 √ m features.

Train a random forest on the new subseries dataset W (line 10). W contains n · w cases, each with w · v + 3 attributes. The number of trees in the random forest is determined by incrementally adding trees in groups of 50 until the out of bag error stops decreasing.\n2. Find the random forest out of bag estimates of the class probabilities for each subseries (line 11).\nStage 3: Recombine class probabilities and form a bag of patterns for each series.\n1. Discretise the class probability estimates for each subseries into b equal width bins (line 12).\n2. Bag together these discretised probabilities for each original series, ignoring the last class (line 13). If there are c classes, each instance will have w·(c−1) attributes.\n3. Add on the relative frequency of each predicted class (line 13).\nStage 4: Build the final random forest classifier (line 14).\nNew cases are classified by following the same stages of transformation and internal classification. The number of subseries and the number of intervals are determined by a parameter, z. Training involves searching possible values of z for the one that minimizes the out of bag error for the final classifier. Other parameters are fixed for all experiments. These are the minimum interval length (5), the number of bins for the discretisation (10), the maximum number of trees in the forest (1000), the number of trees to add at each step (50) and the number of repetitions (10)."

It is also based on intervals, but the main difference is that subseries become attributes rather than cases. Like TSBF, building the final model involves first building an internal predictive model. However, LPS creates an internal regression model rather than a classification model. The internal model is designed to detect correlations between subseries, and in this sense is an approximation of an autocorellation function. LPS selects random subseries. For each location, the subseries in the original data are concatenated to form a new attribute. The internal model selects a random attribute as the response variable then constructs a regression tree. A collection of these regression trees are processed to form a new set of instances based on the counts of the number of subseries at each leaf node of each tree.

Randomly select a segment length l\n2. Select s segments of length l from each series, transpose\neach segment, then concatenate. The gives a matrix M with l · n rows and s columns.\n3. Generate the difference vector for each series, transpose then concatenate. Add the new attributes to the matrix M, which now has 2s columns.\n4. Choose a random column from M as the response variable.\n5. Build a random regression tree (i.e. a tree that only considers one randomly selected attribute at each level) with maximum depth of d.\nStage 2: Form a count distribution over each tree’s leaf node.\n1. For each case x in the original data, get the number of rows of M that reside in each leaf node for all cases originating from x.\n2. Concatenate these counts to form a new instance. Thus if every tree had t terminal nodes, the new case would have r · t features. In reality, each tree will have a different number of terminal nodes.\nClassification of new cases is based on a 1-nearest neighbour classification on these concatenated leaf node counts.\nThere are two versions of LPS available, both of which aim to avoid the problem of generating all possible subseries. The R and C version creates the randomly selected attribute at Stage 1 on the fly at each level of the tree. This avoids the need to generate all possible subseries, but requires a bespoke tree. The second implementation (in Matlab) fixes the number of subseries to randomly select for each tree. Experiments suggest there is little difference in accuracy between the two approaches. We adopt the latter algorithm because it allows us to use the Weka RandomRegressionTree algorithm, thus simplifying the code and reducing the likelihood of bugs."

We were unable to find a working Java based MPEG1 encoder, and the technique seems not to work with the MPEG4 encoders we tried.

The data are from a wide range of domains, with an over representation of image outline classification problems. We are introducing four new food spectra data sets Ham, Meat, Strawberry and Wine. These were all created by the Institute of Food Research, part of the Norwich Research Park, as were the three spectra data already in the UCR (Beef, Coffee and OliveOil). Table 2 gives the breakdown of number of problems per category.\nWe run the same 100 resample folds on each problem for every classifier. The first fold is always the original train test split. The other resamples are stratified to retain class distribution in the original data sets. These resample datasets can be exactly reproduced.\nEach classifier must be evaluated 8,500 times. Model selection is repeated on every training set fold. We used the parameter values searched in the relevant publication as closely as possible. The parameter values we search are listed in Table 3. We allow each classifier a maximum 100 parameter values, each of which we assess through a cross validation on the training data. The number of cross validation folds is dependent on the algorithm. This is because the overhead of the internal cross validation differs. For the distance based measures it is as fast to do a leave-one-out cross validation as any other. For others we need a new model for each set of parameter values. This means we need to construct 850,000 models for each classifier. When we include repetitions caused by bugs, we estimate we have conducted over 30 million distinct experiments over six months.\nThe datasets vary greatly in size. The eight largest (grouped by the working title ‘the pigs’) are ElectricalDevices, FordA, FordB, HandOutlines, NonInvasive1, NonInvasive2, StarlightCurves and UWaveGestureLibraryAll. We have had to sub-sample these data sets for the model selection stages, in particular for the slower algorithms such as ST, LPS and BOSS. Full details of the sampling performed are in the code documentation.\nWe follow the basic methodology described in [10] when testing for significant difference between classifiers. For any single problem we can compare differences between two or more\nclassifiers over the 100 resamples using standard parametric tests (t-test for two classifiers, ANOVA for multiple classifiers) or non parametric test (binomial test or the Wilcoxon sign rank test for two classifiers, Friedman test for multiple classifiers). However, the fact we are resampling data means the observations are not independent and we should be careful interpreting to much into the results for a single problem. The real benefit of resampling is to reduce the risk of bias introduced through overfitting on a single sample. Our main focus of interest is relative performance over multiple data sets. Hence, we average accuracies over all 100 resamples, then compare classifiers by ranks using the Friedman test and a post-hoc pairwise Nemenyi test to discover where the differences lie."

The most obvious starting point for any classification problem is to use a standard classifier that treats each series a vector (i.e. make no explicit use of any autocorellation structure). Some characteristics that make TSC problems hard include having few cases, long series (large number of attributes) many of which are redundant or correlated. These are problems that are well studied in machine learning and classifiers have been designed to compensate for them. TSC characteristics that will confound traditional classifiers include discriminatory features in the autocorrelation function, phase independence within a class and imbedded discriminatory subseries. However, not all problems will have this characteristic, and benchmarking against standard classifiers may give insights into the problem characteristics. We\nhave experimented with Weka versions of C4.5 (C45), naive Bayes (NB), logistic Regression (logistic), support vector machine with linear (SVML) and quadratic kernel (SVMQ), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (with 500 trees) (RandF) and rotation forest (with 50 trees) (RotF). In TSC specific research, the starting point with most investigations is 1-NN with Euclidean distance (ED). This basic classifier is a very low benchmark for comparison and is easily beaten with other standard classifiers. A more useful benchmark is 1-NN dynamic time warping with a warping window set through cross validation (DTW) [28].\nRotF, RandF and DTW form a clique of classifiers better than the others.

Of the three distance based approaches we evaluated (TWE, WDTW and MSM), MSM is the highest rank (9th) and is the only one significantly better than both benchmarks. WDTW (ranked 14th) is better than DTW but not RotF. This conclusion contradicts the results in [24] which found no difference between all the elastic algorithms and DTW. This demonstrates that whilst there is a significant improvement, the benefit is small. MSM is under 2% on average better than DTW and RotF. The average of average differences in accuracy between WDTW and DTW is only 0.2%. The fact we are resampling has allowed us to detect such as small improvement. We made no attempts to speed up the distance measures, and of all the measures used in [24], MSM and TWE were by far the slowest. These results indicate it may be worthwhile examining speed ups for MSM.\nDifference Based Classifiers. In line with published re-\nsults, two of the difference based classifiers, CIDDTW and DTDC are significantly better than DTW, but the mean improvement is very small (under 1%). None of the three approaches are significantly different to RotF. We believe this highlights an over-reliance on DTW as a benchmark. In line with the original description we set the CIDDTW as the optimal for DTW. Setting the window to optimise the CIDDTW distance instead might well improve performance.\nDictionary Based Classifiers. The results for window based dictionary classifiers are confusing. SAXVSM and BOP are significantly worse than the benchmarks and ranked 18th and 19th overall respectively. This would seem to suggest there is little merit in dictionary transformations for TSC. However, the BOSS ensemble is one the most accurate classifiers we tested (ranked 3rd). It is significantly better than both benchmarks and is ranked third overall. The main differences between BOP and BOSS are that BOSS uses a Fourier transformation rather than PAA and employs a data driven discretisation rather than arbitrary break points in the Normal distribution. This indicates that there may be further scope for window based spectral classifiers. The use of an ensemble also significantly improves accuracy. It would be interesting to detect which difference contributes most to the improved performance of the BOSS ensemble. DTWF also did well (ranked 5th). Including SAX features significantly improves DTWF , so our conjecture is that the DTW features are compensating for the datasets that BOP does poorly on, whilst gaining from those it does well at. This would support the COTE argument for combining features from different representations.\nShapelet Based Classifiers. FS is the least accurate classifier we tested and is significantly worse than the benchmarks. LS is not significantly better than either benchmark and in fact it is significantly worse than DTW. Our FS algorithm reproduces published results and we believe is faithful to the original. We have put considerable effort into debugging LS and have been in correspondence with the author. He believes the difference is caused by the fact we have not included the adaptive learning rate adjustment implemented through Adagrad. We are working with him to include this enhancement. Conversely, the ST has exceeded our expectations. It is significantly better than both benchmarks is the second most accurate classifier overall, significantly better than six of the other eight classifiers that beat both benchmarks. The changes proposed in [6] have not only made it much faster, but have also increased accuracy. Primary amongst these changes is balancing the number of shapelets per class and using a one-vs-many shapelet quality measure. However, ST is the slowest of all the algorithms we assessed and there is scope to increase the speed without compromising accuracy.\nInterval Based Classifiers. The interval based approaches, TSF, TSBF and LPS, are all significantly better than both the benchmarks. This gives clear support to the idea of interval based approaches. There is no significant difference between them. Hence, based on this evidence, we conclude there is definite value in interval based algorithms and would favour TSF for its simplicity.\nEnsemble Classifiers. The top seven classifiers are all ensembles. This is strong evidence to support the view that\nensembling is one of the simplest ways of improving a classifier. It seems highly likely the other classifiers would benefit from a similar approach. One of the key ensemble design decisions is promoting diversity without compromising accuracy. TSF, TSBF and LPS do this through the standard approach of sampling the attribute space. BOSS ensembles identical classifiers with different parameter settings. ST and EE engender diversity though classifier heterogeneity. Employing different base classifiers in an ensemble is relatively unusual, and these results would suggest that it might be employed more often. COTE is significantly better than all other classifiers. It promotes diversity through employing different transformations/data representations and weighting by a training set accuracy estimate. Its simplicity is its strength. These experiments suggest COTE may be even more accurate if it were to assimilate BOSS and an interval based approach."

      "text" : "Table 5 shows the performance of algorithms against problem type. The data is meant to give an indication as to which family of approaches may be best for each problem type. The sample sizes are small, so we must be careful drawing too many conclusions. However, this table does indicate how evaluation can give insights into problem domains. So, for example, Shapelets are best on 4 out of 6 of the ElectricDevice problems and 3 out of 6 ECG datasets, but only 26% of problems overall. This makes sense in terms of the applications, because the profile of electricity usage and ECG irregularity will be a subseries of the whole and largely phase independent. Vector classifiers are best on 43% of the Spectrograph data sets. COTE is the best algorithm on over 40% of the image outline problems. This suggests\nthat there are a range of features that help classify these problems and no one representation is likely to be sufficient."

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "The primary goal of this series of benchmark experiments is to promote reproducible research and provide a common framework for future work in this area.\nWe view data mining as a practical area of research, and our central motivation is to find techniques that work. Received wisdom is that DTW is hard to beat. Our results confirm this to a degree (7 out of 19 algorithms fail to do so), but recent advances show it not impossible.\nOverall, our results indicate that COTE is, on average, clearly superior to other published techniques. It is on average 8% more accurate than DTW. However, COTE is a starting point rather than a final solution. Firstly, the no free lunch theorem leads us to believe that no classifier will dominate all others. The research issues of most interest are what types of algorithm work best on what types of problem and can we tell a priori which algorithm will be best for a specific problem. Secondly, COTE is hugely computationally intensive. It is trivial to parallelise, but its run time complexity is bounded by the Shapelet Transform, which is O(n2m4) and the parameter searches for the elastic distance measures, some of which are O(n3). An algorithm that is faster than COTE but not significantly less accurate would be a genuine advance in the field. Finally, we are only looking at a very restricted type of problem. We have not considered multi-dimensional, streaming, windowed, long series or semi-supervised TSC, to name but a few variants. Each of these subproblems would benefit from a comprehensive experimental analysis\nof recently proposed techniques.\nWe are constantly looking for new areas of application and we will include any new data sets that are donated in an ongoing evaluation. We will happily evaluate anyone else’s algorithm if it is implemented as a WEKA classifier (with all model selection performed in the method buildClassifier) and if it is computationally feasible. If we are given permission we will release any results we can verify through the associated website.\nFor those looking to build a predictive model for a new problem we would recommend starting with DTW, RandF and RotF as a basic sanity check and benchmark. We have made little effort to perform model selection for the forest approaches because it is generally accepted they are robust to parameter settings, but some consideration of forest size and tree parameters may yield improvements. However, our conclusion is that using COTE will probably give you the most accurate model. If a simpler approach is needed and the discriminatory features are likely to be embedded in subseries, then we would recommend using TSF or ST if the features are in the time domain (depending on whether they are phase dependent or not) or BOSS if they are in the frequency domain. If a whole series elastic measure seems appropriate, then using EE is likely to lead to better predictions than using just DTW.\nFinally, we stress that accuracy is not the only consideration when assessing a TSC algorithm. Time and space efficiency are often of equal or greater concern. However, if the only metric used to support a new TSC is accuracy on these test problems, then we believe that evaluation should be transparent and comparable to the results we have made available. If a proposed algorithm is not more accurate than those we have evaluated, then some other case for the algorithm must be made."

These algorithms have been evaluated on subsets of the 47 data sets in the University of California, Riverside time series classification archive. The archive has recently been expanded to 85 data sets, over half of which have been donated by researchers at the University of East Anglia. Aspects of previous evaluations have made comparisons between algorithms difficult. For example, several different programming languages have been used, experiments involved a single train/test split and some used normalised data whilst others did not. The relaunch of the archive provides a timely opportunity to thoroughly evaluate algorithms on a larger number of datasets. We have implemented 18 recently proposed algorithms in a common Java framework and compared them against two standard benchmark classifiers (and each other) by performing 100 resampling experiments on each of the 85 datasets. We use these results to test several hypotheses relating to whether the algorithms are significantly more accurate than the benchmarks and each other. Our results indicate that only 9 of these algorithms are significantly more accurate than both benchmarks and that one classifier, the Collective of Transformation Ensembles, is significantly more accurate than all of the others. All of our experiments and results are reproducible: we release all of our code, results and experimental details and we hope these experiments form the basis for more rigorous testing of new algorithms in the future.",
