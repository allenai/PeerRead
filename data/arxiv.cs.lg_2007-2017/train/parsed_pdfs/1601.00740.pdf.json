      "text" : "In this work we propose a vehicular sensor-rich platform and learning algorithms for maneuver anticipation. For this purpose we equip a car with cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS), and a computing device to capture the driving context from both inside and outside of the car. In order to anticipate maneuvers, we propose a sensory-fusion deep learning architecture which jointly learns to anticipate and fuse multiple sensory streams. Our architecture consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to capture long temporal dependencies. We propose a novel training procedure which allows the network to predict the future given only a partial temporal context. We introduce a diverse data set with 1180 miles of natural freeway and city driving, and show that we can anticipate maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur in realtime with a precision and recall of 90.5% and 87.4% respectively.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOver the last decade cars have been equipped with various assistive technologies in order to provide a safe driving experience. Technologies such as lane keeping, blind spot check, precrash systems etc., are successful in alerting drivers whenever they commit a dangerous maneuver [43]. Still in the US alone more than 33,000 people die in road accidents every year, the majority of which are due to inappropriate maneuvers [2]. We therefore need mechanisms that can alert drivers before they perform a dangerous maneuver in order to avert many such accidents [56].\nIn this work we address the problem of anticipating maneuvers that a driver is likely to perform in the next few seconds. Figure 1 shows our system anticipating a left turn maneuver a few seconds before the car reaches the intersection. Our system also outputs probabilities over the maneuvers the driver can perform. With this prior knowledge of maneuvers, the driver assistance systems can alert drivers about possible dangers before they perform the maneuver, thereby giving them more time to react. Some previous works [22, 41, 50] also predict a driver’s future maneuver. However, as we show in the following sections, these methods use limited context and/or do not accurately model the anticipation problem.\nIn order to anticipate maneuvers, we reason with the contextual information from the surrounding events, which we refer to as the driving context. We obtain this driving context from multiple sources. We use videos of the driver inside the car and the road in front, the vehicle’s dynamics, global position coordinates (GPS), and street maps; from this we extract a time series of multi-modal data from both inside and outside the vehicle. The challenge lies in modeling the temporal aspects of driving and fusing the multiple sensory streams. In this work we propose a specially tailored approach for anticipation in such sensory-rich settings.\nAnticipation of the future actions of a human is an important perception task with applications in robotics and computer vision [39, 77, 33, 34, 73]. It requires the prediction of future events from a limited temporal context. This differentiates anticipation from activity recognition [73], where the complete temporal context is available for prediction. Furthermore, in sensory-rich robotics settings like ours, the context for anticipation comes from multiple sensors. In such scenarios the end performance of the application largely depends on how the information from different sensors are fused. Previous works on anticipation [33, 34, 39] usually deal with singledata modality and do not address anticipation for sensory-rich robotics applications. Additionally, they learn representations using shallow architectures [30, 33, 34, 39] that cannot handle long temporal dependencies [6].\nIn order to address the anticipation problem more generally,\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n00 74\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 5\nJ an\n2 01\n6\n\uD835\uDC312\uD835\uDC311 \uD835\uDC313 \uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC47\n\uD835\uDC32 \uD835\uDC32 \uD835\uDC32 \uD835\uDC32\n(\uD835\uDC311, \uD835\uDC312, … , \uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC47) → \uD835\uDC32\nTraining example\nTraining RNN for anticipation\n\uD835\uDC311 \uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC61\n\uD835\uDC32\uD835\uDC61\n(\uD835\uDC311, \uD835\uDC312, … , \uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC61)\nTest example\nAnticipation given partial context\n?\n1 \uD835\uDC47 1 \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC61 =\nFig. 2: (Left) Shows training RNN for anticipation in a sequenceto-sequence prediction manner. The network explicitly learns to map the partial context (x1, ..,xt) ∀t to the future event y. (Right) At test time the network’s goal is to anticipate the future event as soon as possible, i.e. by observing only a partial temporal context.\nwe propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based architecture which learns rich representations for anticipation. We focus on sensory-rich robotics applications, and our architecture learns how to optimally fuse information from different sensors. Our approach captures temporal dependencies by using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. We train our architecture in a sequence-to-sequence prediction manner (Figure 2) such that it explicitly learns to anticipate given a partial context, and we introduce a novel loss layer which helps anticipation by preventing over-fitting.\nWe evaluate our approach on a driving data set with 1180 miles of natural freeway and city driving collected across two states – from 10 drivers and with different kinds of driving maneuvers. The data set is challenging because of the variations in routes and traffic conditions, and the driving styles of the drivers (Figure 3). We demonstrate that our deep learning sensory-fusion approach anticipates maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur with 84.5% precision and 77.1% recall while using out-of-the-box face tracker. With more sophesticated 3D pose estimation of the face, our precision and recall increases to 90.5% and 87.4% respectively. We believe that our work creates scope for new ADAS features to make roads safer. In summary our key contributions are as follows:\n• We propose an approach for anticipating driving maneuvers several seconds in advance. • We propose a generic sensory-fusion RNN-LSTM architecture for anticipation in robotics applications. • We release the first data set of natural driving with videos from both inside and outside the car, GPS, and speed information. • We release an open-source deep learning package\nNeuralModels which is especially designed for robotics applications with multiple sensory streams.\nOur data set and deep learning code are publicly available at: http://www.brain4cars.com"

      "text" : "Our work builds upon the previous works on assisitive vehicular technologies, anticipating human activities, learning temporal models, and computer vision methods for analyzing human face. Assistive features for vehicles. Latest cars available in market comes equipped with cameras and sensors to monitor the surrounding environment. Through multi-sensory fusion they provide assisitive features like lane keeping, forward collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control etc. These systems warn drivers when they perform a potentially dangerous maneuver [59, 68]. Driver monitoring for distraction and drowsiness has also been extensively researched [21, 55]. Techniques like eye-gaze tracking are now commercially available (Seeing Machines Ltd.) and has been effective in detecting distraction. Our work complements existing ADAS and driver monitoring techniques by anticipating maneuvers several seconds before they occur.\nClosely related to us are previous works on predicting the driver’s intent. Vehicle trajectory has been used to predict the intent for lane change or turn maneuver [9, 22, 41, 44]. Most of these works ignore the rich context available from cameras, GPS, and street maps. Previous works have addressed maneuver anticipation [1, 50, 15, 67] through sensoryfusion from multiple cameras, GPS, and vehicle dynamics. In particular, Morris et al. [50] and Trivedi et al. [67] used Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for intent prediction and performed sensory fusion by concatenating feature vectors. We will show that such hand designed concatenation of features does not work well. Furthermore, these works do not model the temporal aspect of the problem properly. They assume\nthat informative contextual cues always appear at a fixed time before the maneuver. We show that this assumption is not true, and in fact the temporal aspect of the problem should be carefully modeled. In contrast to these works, our RNN-LSTM based sensory-fusion architecture captures long temporal dependencies through its memory cell and learns rich representations for anticipation through a hierarchy of non-linear transformations of input data. Our work is also related to works on driver behavior prediction with different sensors [26, 21, 20], and vehicular controllers which act on these predictions [59, 68, 18]. Anticipation and Modeling Humans. Modeling of human motion has given rise to many applications, anticipation being one of them. Anticipating human activities has shown to improve human-robot collaboration [73, 36, 46, 38, 16]. Similarly, forecasting human navigation trajectories has enabled robots to plan sociable trajectories around humans [33, 8, 39, 29]. Feature matching techniques have been proposed for anticipating human activities from videos [57]. Modeling human preferences has enabled robots to plan good trajectories [17, 60, 28, 31]. Similar to these works, we anticipate human actions, which are driving maneuvers in our case. However, the algorithms proposed in the previous works do not apply in our setting. In our case, anticipating maneuvers requires modeling the interaction between the driving context and the driver’s intention. Such interactions are absent in the previous works, and they use shallow architectures [6] that do not properly model temporal aspects of human activities. They further deal with a single data modality and do not tackle the challenges of sensory-fusion. Our problem setup involves all these challenges, for which we propose a deep learning approach which efficiently handles temporal dependencies and learns to fuse multiple sensory streams. Analyzing the human face. The vision approaches related to our work are face detection and tracking [69, 76], statistical models of face [10] and pose estimation methods for face [75]. Active Appearance Model (AAM) [10] and its variants [47, 74] statistically model the shape and texture of the face. AAMs have also been used to estimate the 3D-pose of a face from a single image [75] and in design of assistive features for driver monitoring [55, 63]. In our approach we adapt off-theshelf available face detection [69] and tracking algorithms [58] (see Section VI). Our approach allows us to easily experiment with more advanced face detection and tracking algorithms. We demonstrate this by using the Constrained Local Neural Field (CLNF) model [4] and tracking 68 fixed landmark points on the driver’s face and estimating the 3D head-pose. Learning temporal models. Temporal models are commonly used to model human activities [35, 49, 71, 72]. These models have been used in both discriminative and generative fashions. The discriminative temporal models are mostly inspired by the Conditional Random Field (CRF) [42] which captures the temporal structure of the problem. Wang et al. [72] and Morency et al. [49] propose dynamic extensions of the CRF for image segmentation and gesture recognition respectively. On the other hand, generative approaches for temporal modeling include various filtering methods, such as Kalman and particle filters [64], Hidden Markov Models, and many types of Dynamic Bayesian Networks [51]. Some previous works [9, 40, 53] used HMMs to model different aspects of the driver’s behaviour. Most of these generative approaches model how latent (hidden) states influence the observations. However, in our problem both the latent states and the observations influence each other. In the following sections, we will describe the Autoregressive Input-Output HMM (AIO-HMM) for maneuver anticipation [30] and will use it as a baseline to compare our deep learning approach. Unlike AIO-HMM our deep architecture have internal memory which allows it to handle long temporal dependencies [24]. Furthermore, the input features undergo a hierarchy of nonlinear transformation through the deep architecture which allows learning rich representations. Two building blocks of our architecture are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) [54] and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units [25]. Our work draws upon ideas from previous works on RNNs and LSTM from the language [62], speech [23], and vision [14] communities. Our approach to the joint training of multiple RNNs is related to the recent work on hierarchical RNNs [19]. We consider RNNs in multi-modal setting, which is related to the recent use of RNNs in imagecaptioning [14]. Our contribution lies in formulating activity anticipation in a deep learning framework using RNNs with LSTM units. We focus on sensory-rich robotics applications, and our architecture extends previous works doing sensoryfusion with feed-forward networks [52, 61] to the fusion of temporal streams. Using our architecture we demonstrate stateof-the-art on maneuver anticipation."

      "text" : "Our goal is to anticipate driving maneuvers a few seconds before they occur. This includes anticipating a lane change before the wheels touch the lane markings or anticipating if the driver keeps straight or makes a turn when approaching an intersection. This is a challenging problem for multiple reasons. First, it requires the modeling of context from different sources. Information from a single source, such as a camera capturing events outside the car, is not sufficiently rich. Additional visual information from within the car can also be used. For example, the driver’s head movements are useful for anticipation – drivers typically check for the side traffic while changing lanes and scan the cross traffic at intersections. Second, reasoning about maneuvers should take into account the driving context at both local and global levels. Local context requires modeling events in vehicle’s vicinity such as the surrounding vision, GPS, and speed information. On the other hand, factors that influence the overall route contributes to the global context, such as the driver’s final destination. Third, the informative cues necessary for anticipation appear at\nvariable times before the maneuver, as illustrated in Figure 5. In particular, the time interval between the driver’s head movement and the occurrence of the maneuver depends on many factors such as the speed, traffic conditions, etc.\nIn addition, appropriately fusing the information from multiple sensors is crucial for anticipation. Simple sensory fusion approaches like concatenation of feature vectors performs poorly, as we demonstrate through experiments. In our proposed approach we learn a neural network layer for fusing the temporal streams of data coming from different sensors. Our resulting architecture is end-to-end trainable via back propagation, and we jointly train it to: (i) model the temporal aspects of the problem; (ii) fuse multiple sensory streams; and (iii) anticipate maneuvers."

      "text" : "For maneuver anticipation our vehicular sensory platform includes the following (as shown in Figure 4):\n1) A driver-facing camera inside the vehicle. We mount this camera on the dashboard and use it to track the driver’s head movements. This camera operates at 25 fps. 2) A camera facing the road is mounted on the dashboard to capture the (outside) view in front of the car. This camera operates at 30 fps. The video from this camera enables additional reasoning on maneuvers. For example, when the vehicle is in the left-most lane, the only safe maneuvers are a right-lane change or keeping straight, unless the vehicle is approaching an intersection. 3) A speed logger for vehicle dynamics because maneuvers correlate with the vehicle’s speed, e.g., turns usually happen at lower speeds than lane changes. 4) A Global Positioning System (GPS) for localizing the vehicle on the map. This enables us to detect upcoming road artifacts such as intersections, highway exits, etc.\nUsing this system we collect 1180 miles of natural city and freeway driving data from 10 drivers. We denote the information from sensors with feature vector x. Our vehicular systems gives a temporal sequence of feature vectors {(x1,x2, ...,xt, ...)}. For now we do not distinguish between the information from different sensors, later in Section V-B we introduce sensory fusion. In Section VI we formally define our feature representations and describe our data set in Section VIII-A. We now formally define anticipation and present our deep learning architecture."

      "text" : "We now formally define anticipation and then present our Recurrent Neural Network architecture. The goal of anticipation is to predict an event several seconds before it happens given the contextual information up to the present time. The future event can be one of multiple possibilities. At training time a set of temporal sequences of observations and events {(x1,x2, ...,xT )j ,yj}Nj=1 is provided where xt is the observation at time t, y is the representation of the event\n(described below) that happens at the end of the sequence at t = T , and j is the sequence index. At test time, however, the algorithm receives an observation xt at each time step, and its goal is to predict the future event as early as possible, i.e. by observing only a partial sequence of observations {(x1, ...,xt)|t < T}. This differentiates anticipation from activity recognition [70, 37] where in the latter the complete observation sequence is available at test time. In this paper, xt is a real-valued feature vector and y = [y1, ..., yK ] is a vector of size K (the number of events), where yk denotes the probability of the temporal sequence belonging to event the k such that ∑K k=1 y\nk = 1. At the time of training, y takes the form of a one-hot vector with the entry in y corresponding to the ground truth event as 1 and the rest 0.\nIn this work we propose a deep RNN architecture with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units [25] for anticipation.

A common remedy to vanishing gradients is to replace tanh non-linearities by Long Short-Term Memory cells [25]. We now give an overview of LSTM and then describe our model for anticipation."

      "text" : "LSTM is a network of neurons that implements a memory cell [25]. The central idea behind LSTM is that the memory cell can maintain its state over time. When combined with RNN, LSTM units allow the recurrent network to remember long term context dependencies.\nLSTM consists of three gates – input gate i, output gate o, and forget gate f – and a memory cell c. See Figure 6 for an illustration. At each time step t, LSTM first computes its gates’ activations {it,ft} (3)(4) and updates its memory cell from ct−1 to ct (5), it then computes the output gate activation ot (6), and finally outputs a hidden representation ht (7). The inputs into LSTM are the observations xt and\nthe hidden representation from the previous time step ht−1. LSTM applies the following set of update operations:\nit = σ(Wixt + Uiht−1 + Vict−1 + bi) (3) ft = σ(Wfxt + Ufht−1 + Vfct−1 + bf ) (4) ct = ft ct−1 + it tanh(Wcxt + Ucht−1 + bc) (5) ot = σ(Woxt + Uoht−1 + Voct + bo) (6) ht = ot tanh(ct) (7)\nwhere is an element-wise product and σ is the logistic function. σ and tanh are applied element-wise. W∗, V∗, U∗, and b∗ are the parameters, further the weight matrices V∗ are diagonal. The input and forget gates of LSTM participate in updating the memory cell (5). More specifically, forget gate controls the part of memory to forget, and the input gate computes new values based on the current observation that are written to the memory cell. The output gate together with the memory cell computes the hidden representation (7). Since LSTM cell activation involves summation over time (5) and derivatives distribute over sums, the gradient in LSTM gets propagated over a longer time before vanishing. In the standard RNN, we replace the non-linear f in equation (1) by the LSTM equations given above in order to capture long temporal dependencies. We use the following shorthand notation to denote the recurrent LSTM operation.\n(ht, ct) = LSTM(xt,ht−1, ct−1) (8)\nWe now describe our RNN architecture with LSTM units for anticipation.

This makes anticipation challenging and also differentiates it from activity recognition. Previous works treat anticipation as a recognition problem [34, 50, 57] and train discriminative classifiers (such as SVM or CRF) on the complete temporal context. However, at test time these classifiers only observe a partial temporal context and make predictions within a filtering framework. We model anticipation with a recurrent architecture which unfolds through time. This lets us train a single classifier that learns to handle partial temporal context of varying lengths.\nFurthermore, anticipation in robotics applications is challenging because the contextual information can come from multiple sensors with different data modalities. Examples include autonomous vehicles that reason from multiple sensors [3] or robots that jointly reason over perception and language instructions [48]. In such applications the way information from different sensors is fused is critical to the application’s final performance. We therefore build an end-to-end deep learning architecture which jointly learns to anticipate and fuse information from different sensors."

However, we found that this sort of simple concatenation performs poorly. We instead learn a sensory fusion layer which combines the high-level representations of sensor data. Our proposed architecture first passes the two sensory streams {(x1, ...,xT ), (z1, ..., zT )} independently through separate RNNs (9) and (10). The high level representations from both RNNs {(hx1 , ...,hxT ), (hz1, ...,hzT ) are then concatenated at each time step t and passed through a fully connected (fusion) layer which fuses the two representations (11), as shown in Figure 7.

(12). We propose to modify this loss by multiplying it with an exponential term as illustrated in Figure 7. Under this new scheme, the loss exponentially grows with time as shown below.\nloss = N∑ j=1 T∑ t=1 −e−(T−t) log(ykt ) (13)\nThis loss penalizes the RNN exponentially more for the mistakes it makes as it sees more observations. This encourages the model to fix mistakes as early as it can in time.

We do this by grouping the overall contextual information from the sensors into: (i) the context from inside the vehicle, which comes from the driver facing camera and is represented as temporal sequence of features (z1, ..., zT ); and (ii) the context from outside the vehicle, which comes from the remaining sensors: GPS, road facing camera, and street\nmaps. We represent the outside context with (x1, ...,xT ). In order to anticipate maneuvers, our RNN architecture (Figure 7) processes the temporal context {(x1, ...,xt), (z1, ..., zt)} at every time step t, and outputs softmax probabilities yt for the following five maneuvers:M = {left turn, right turn, left lane change, right lane change, straight driving}.\nA. Inside-vehicle features.\nThe inside features zt capture the driver’s head movements at each time instant t. Our vision pipeline consists of face detection, tracking, and feature extraction modules. We extract head motion features per-frame, denoted by φ(face). We compute zt by aggregating φ(face) for every 20 frames, i.e., zt = ∑20 i=1 φ(facei)/‖ ∑20 i=1 φ(facei)‖. Face detection and tracking. We detect the driver’s face using a trained Viola-Jones face detector [69]. From the detected face, we first extract visually discriminative (facial) points using the Shi-Tomasi corner detector [58] and then track those facial points using the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracker [45, 58, 66]. However, the tracking may accumulate errors over time because of changes in illumination due to the shadows of trees, traffic, etc. We therefore constrain the tracked facial points to follow a projective transformation and remove the incorrectly tracked points using the RANSAC algorithm. While tracking the facial points, we lose some of the tracked points with every new frame. To address this problem, we re-initialize the tracker with new discriminative facial points once the number of tracked points falls below a threshold [32].\nHead motion features. For maneuver anticipation the horizontal movement of the face and its angular rotation (yaw) are particularly important. From the face tracking we obtain face tracks, which are 2D trajectories of the tracked facial points in the image plane. Figure 8 (bottom) shows how the horizontal coordinates of the tracked facial points vary with time before a left turn maneuver. We represent the driver’s face movements and rotations with histogram features. In particular, we take matching facial points between successive frames and create histograms of their corresponding horizontal motions (in pixels) and angular motions in the image plane (Figure 8). We bin the horizontal and angular motions using [≤ −2, −2 to 0, 0 to 2, ≥ 2] and [0 to π2 , π 2 to π, π to 3π 2 , 3π 2 to 2π], respectively. We also calculate the mean movement of the driver’s face center. This gives us φ(face) ∈ R9 facial features per-frame. The driver’s eye-gaze is also useful a feature. However, robustly estimating 3D eye-gaze in outside environment is still a topic of research, and orthogonal to this work on anticipation. We therefore do not consider eye-gaze features. 3D head pose and facial landmark features. Our framework is flexible and allows incorporating more advanced face detection and tracking algorithms. For example we replace the KLT tracker described above with the Constrained Local Neural Field (CLNF) model [4] and track 68 fixed landmark points on the driver’s face. CLNF is particularly well suited for driving scenarios due its ability to handle a wide range of head pose and illumination variations. As shown in Figure 9, CLNF offers us two distinct benefits over the features from KLT (i) while discriminative facial points may change from situation to situation, tracking fixed landmarks results in consistent optical flow trajectories which adds to robustness; and (ii) CLNF also allows us to estimate the 3D head pose of the driver’s face by minimizing error in the projection of a generic 3D mesh model of the face w.r.t. the 2D location of landmarks in the image. The histogram features generated from the optical flow trajectories along with the 3D head pose features (yaw, pitch and row), give us φ(face) ∈ R12 when using the CLNF tracker.\nIn Section VIII we present results with the features from KLT, as well as the results with richer features obtained from the CLNF model."

We also augment the vehicle’s GPS coordinates with the street maps and extract a binary feature indicating if the vehicle is within 15 meters of a road artifact such as intersections, turns, highway exists, etc. We also encode the average, maximum, and minimum speeds of the vehicle over the last 5 seconds as features.

These models form a strong baseline to compare our sensory-fusion deep learning architecture.\nDriving maneuvers are influenced by multiple interactions involving the vehicle, its driver, outside traffic, and occasionally global factors like the driver’s destination. These interactions influence the driver’s intention, i.e. their state of mind before the maneuver, which is not directly observable. In our Bayesian network formulation, we represent the driver’s intention with discrete states that are latent (or hidden). In order to anticipate maneuvers, we jointly model the driving context and the latent states in a tractable manner. We represent the driving context as a set of features described in Section VI. We now present the motivation for the Bayesian networks and then discuss our key model Autoregressive Input-Output HMM (AIO-HMM)."

      "text" : "Modeling maneuvers require temporal modeling of the driving context. Discriminative methods, such as the Support Vector Machine and the Relevance Vector Machine [65], which do not model the temporal aspect perform poorly on anticipation tasks, as we show in Section VIII. Therefore, a temporal model such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is better suited to model maneuver anticipation.\nAn HMM models how the driver’s latent states generate both the inside driving context (zt) and the outside driving context (xt). However, a more accurate model should capture how events outside the vehicle (i.e. the outside driving context) affect the driver’s state of mind, which then generates the observations inside the vehicle (i.e. the inside driving context). Such interactions can be modeled by an Input-Output HMM (IOHMM) [7]. However, modeling the problem with IOHMM does not capture the temporal dependencies of the inside driving context. These dependencies are critical to capture the smooth and temporally correlated behaviours such as the driver’s face movements. We therefore present Autoregressive Input-Output HMM (AIO-HMM) which extends IOHMM to model these observation dependencies. Figure 10 shows the AIO-HMM graphical model for modeling maneuvers. We learn separate AIO-HMM model for each maneuver. In order to anticipate maneuvers, during inference we determine which model best explains the past several seconds of the driving context based on the data log-likelihood. In Appendix A we describe the training and inference procedure for AIO-HMM."

We train it on the same features as SVM with 150 trees of depth ten each.\n• HMM: This is the Hidden Markov Model. We train the HMM on a temporal sequence of feature vectors that we extract every 0.8 seconds, i.e., every 20 video frames. We consider three versions of the HMM: (i) HMM E: with only outside features from the road camera, the vehicle’s speed, GPS and street maps (Section VI-B); (ii) HMM F : with only inside features from the driver’s face (Section VI-A); and (ii) HMM E + F : with both inside and outside features.\n• IOHMM: Jain et al.

      "heading" : "C. Evaluation protocol",
      "text" : "We evaluate an algorithm based on its correctness in predicting future maneuvers. We anticipate maneuvers every 0.8 seconds where the algorithm processes the recent context and assigns a probability to each of the four maneuvers: {left lane change, right lane change, left turn, right turn} and a probability to the event of driving straight. These five probabilities together sum to one. After anticipation, i.e. when the algorithm has computed all five probabilities, the algorithm predicts a maneuver if its probability is above a threshold pth. If none of the maneuvers’ probabilities are above this threshold, the algorithm does not make a maneuver prediction and predicts driving straight. However, when it predicts one of the four maneuvers, it sticks with this prediction and makes no further predictions for next 5 seconds or until a maneuver occurs, whichever happens earlier. After 5 seconds or a maneuver has occurred, it returns to anticipating future maneuvers. Algorithm 1 shows the inference steps for maneuver anticipation.\nDuring this process of anticipation and prediction, the algorithm makes (i) true predictions (tp): when it predicts the correct maneuver; (ii) false predictions (fp): when it predicts a maneuver but the driver performs a different maneuver; (iii) false positive predictions (fpp): when it predicts a maneuver\nbut the driver does not perform any maneuver (i.e. driving straight); and (iv) missed predictions (mp): when it predicts driving straight but the driver performs a maneuver. We evaluate the algorithms using their precision and recall scores:\nPr = tp\ntp+ fp+ fpp︸ ︷︷ ︸ Total # of maneuver predictions\n; Re = tp\ntp+ fp+mp︸ ︷︷ ︸ Total # of maneuvers\nThe precision measures the fraction of the predicted maneuvers that are correct and recall measures the fraction of the maneuvers that are correctly predicted. For true predictions (tp) we also compute the average time-to-maneuver, where timeto-maneuver is the interval between the time of algorithm’s prediction and the start of the maneuver.\nWe perform cross validation to choose the number of the driver’s latent states in the AIO-HMM and the threshold on probabilities for maneuver prediction. For SVM we crossvalidate for the parameter C and the choice of kernel from Gaussian and polynomial kernels. The parameters are chosen as the ones giving the highest F1-score on a validation set. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall, defined as F1 = 2 ∗ Pr ∗Re/(Pr +Re)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "D. Quantitative results",
      "text" : "We evaluate the algorithms on maneuvers that were not seen during training and report the results using 5-fold cross validation. Table I reports the precision and recall scores under three settings: (i) Lane change: when the algorithms only predict for the left and right lane changes. This setting is relevant for highway driving where the prior probabilities of turns are low; (ii) Turns: when the algorithms only predict for the left and right turns; and (iii) All maneuvers: here the algorithms jointly predict all four maneuvers. All three settings include the instances of driving straight.\nTable I compares the performance of the baseline anticipation algorithms, Bayesian networks, and the variants of our deep learning model. All algorithms in Table I use same feature vectors and KLT face tracker which ensures a fair comparison. As shown in the table, overall the best algorithm for maneuver anticipation is F-RNN-EL, and the best performing Bayesian network is AIO-HMM. F-RNN-EL significantly outperforms AIO-HMM in every setting. This improvement in performance is because RNNs with LSTM units are very expressive models with an internal memory. This allows them\nto model the much needed long temporal dependencies for anticipation. Additionally, unlike AIO-HMM, F-RNN-EL is a discriminative model that does not make any assumptions about the generative nature of the problem. The results also highlight the importance of modeling the temporal nature in the data. Classifiers like SVM and Random Forest do not model the temporal aspects and hence performs poorly.\nThe performance of several variants of our deep architecture, reported in Table I, justifies our design decisions to reach the final fusion architecture. When predicting all maneuvers, F-RNN-EL gives 6% higher precision and recall than S-RNN, which performs a simple fusion by concatenating the two sensor streams. On the other hand, F-RNN models each sensor stream with a separate RNN and then uses a fully connected layer to fuse the high-level representations at each time step. This form of sensory fusion is more principled since the sensor streams represent different data modalities. In addition, exponentially growing the loss further improves the performance. Our new loss scheme penalizes the network proportional to the length of context it has seen. When predicting all maneuvers, we observe that F-RNN-EL shows an improvement of 2% in precision and recall over F-RNNUL. We conjecture that exponentially growing the loss acts like a regularizer. It reduces the risk of our network overfitting early in time when there is not enough context available. Furthermore, the time-to-maneuver remains comparable for FRNN with and without exponential loss.\nThe Bayesian networks AIO-HMM and HMM E+F adopt different sensory fusion strategies. AIO-HMM fuses the two sensory streams using an input-output model, on the other hand HMM E + F performs early fusion by concatenation. As a result, AIO-HMM gives 10% higher precision than HMM E + F for jointly predicting all the maneuvers. AIOHMM further extends IOHMM by modeling the temporal dependencies of events inside the vehicle. This results in better performance: on average AIO-HMM precision is 3% higher than IOHMM, as shown in Table I. Another important aspect of anticipation is the joint modeling of the inside and outside driving contexts. HMM F learns only from the inside driving context, while HMM E learns only from the outside driving context. The performances of both the models is therefore less than HMM E + F , which learns jointly both the contexts.\nTable II compares the fpp of different algorithms. False positive predictions (fpp) happen when an algorithm predicts\na maneuver but the driver does not perform any maneuver (i.e. drives straight). Therefore low value of fpp is preferred. HMM F performs best on this metric at 11% as it mostly assigns a high probability to driving straight. However, due to this reason, it incorrectly predicts driving straight even when maneuvers happen. This results in the low recall of HMM F at 36%, as shown in Table I. AIO-HMM’s fpp is 10% less than that of IOHMM and HMM E+F , and F-RNNEL is 3% less than AIO-HMM. The primary reason for false positive predictions is distracted driving. Drivers interactions with fellow passengers or their looking at the surrounding scenes are sometimes wrongly interpreted by the algorithms. Understanding driver distraction is still an open problem, and orthogonal to the objective of this work.\n3D head-pose features. The modularity of our approach allows experimenting with more advanced head tracking algorithms. We replace the pipeline for extracting features from the driver’s face [30] by a Constrained Local Neural Field (CLNF) model [4]. The new vision pipeline tracks 68 facial landmark points and estimates the driver’s 3D head pose as described in Section VI. As shown in Table III, we see a significant, 6% increase in precision and 10% increase in recall of FRNN-EL when using features from our new vision pipeline. This increase in performance is attributed to the following reasons: (i) robustness of CLNF model to variations in illumination and head pose; (ii) 3D head-pose features are very informative for understanding the driver’s intention; and (iii) optical flow trajectories generated by tracking facial landmark points represent head movements better, as shown in Figure 9. The confusion matrix in Figure 13 shows the precision for each maneuver. F-RNN-EL gives a higher precision than AIOHMM on every maneuver when both algorithms are trained on same features (Fig. 13c). The new vision pipeline with CLNF tracker further improves the precision of F-RNN-EL on all maneuvers (Fig. 13d).\nEffect of prediction threshold. In Figure 12 we study how F1-score varies as we change the prediction threshold pth.\nWe make the following observations: (i) The F1-score does not undergo large variations with changes to the prediction threshold. Hence, it allows practitioners to fairly trade-off between the precision and recall without hurting the F1-score by much; and (ii) the maximum F1-score attained by FRNN-EL is 4% more than AIO-HMM when compared on the same features and 13% more with our new vision pipeline. In Tables I, II and III, we used the threshold values which gave the highest F1-score. Anticipation complexity. The F-RNN-EL anticipates maneuvers every 0.8 seconds using the previous 5 seconds of the driving context. The complexity mainly comprises of feature extraction and the model inference in Algorithm 1. Fortunately both these steps can be performed as a dynamic program by storing the computation of the most recent anticipation. Therefore, for every anticipation we only process the incoming 0.8 seconds and not complete 5 seconds of the driving context. On average we predict a maneuver under 0.20 milliseconds using Theano [5] on Nvidia K40 GPU on Ubuntu 12.04."

      "text" : "In this paper we considered the problem of anticipating driving maneuvers a few seconds before the driver performs them. This problem requires the modeling of long temporal dependencies and the fusion of multiple sensory streams. We proposed a novel deep learning architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for anticipation. Our architecture learns to fuse multiple sensory streams, and by training it in a sequence-to-sequence prediction manner, it explicitly learns to anticipate using only a partial temporal context. We also proposed a novel loss layer for anticipation which prevents over-fitting.\nWe release an open-source data set of 1180 miles of natural driving. We performed an extensive evaluation and showed improvement over many baseline algorithms. Our sensory fusion deep learning approach gives a precision of 84.5% and recall of 77.1%, and anticipates maneuvers 3.5 seconds (on average) before they happen. By incorporating the driver’s 3D head-pose our precision and recall improves to 90.5%\nand 87.4% respectively. Potential application of our work is enabling advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to alert drivers before they perform a dangerous maneuver, thereby giving drivers more time to react. We believe that our deep learning architecture is widely applicable to many activity anticipation problems. Our code and data set are publicly available on the project web-page.\nAcknowledgement.

The top (input) layer of the AIO-HMM consists of outside features xT1 .

AIO-HMM has two types of parameters: (i) state transition parameters w; and (ii) observation emission parameters (µ,Σ). We use set S to denote the possible latent states of the driver.

    "abstractText" : "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have made driving safer over the last decade. They prepare vehicles for unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver. However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late. Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger. In this work we propose a vehicular sensor-rich platform and learning algorithms for maneuver anticipation. For this purpose we equip a car with cameras, Global Positioning System (GPS), and a computing device to capture the driving context from both inside and outside of the car. In order to anticipate maneuvers, we propose a sensory-fusion deep learning architecture which jointly learns to anticipate and fuse multiple sensory streams. Our architecture consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to capture long temporal dependencies. We propose a novel training procedure which allows the network to predict the future given only a partial temporal context. We introduce a diverse data set with 1180 miles of natural freeway and city driving, and show that we can anticipate maneuvers 3.5 seconds before they occur in realtime with a precision and recall of 90.5% and 87.4% respectively.",
