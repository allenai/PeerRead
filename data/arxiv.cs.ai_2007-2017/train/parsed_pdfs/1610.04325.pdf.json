      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Bilinear models (Tenenbaum & Freeman, 2000) provide richer representations than linear models. To exploit this advantage, fully-connected layers in neural networks can be replaced with bilinear pooling. The outer product of two vectors (or Kroneker product for matrices) is involved in bilinear pooling, as a result of this, all pairwise interactions among given features are considered. Recently, a successful application of this technique is used for fine-grained visual recognition (Lin et al., 2015).\nHowever, bilinear pooling produces a high-dimensional feature of quadratic expansion, which may constrain a model structure and computational resources. For example, an outer product of two feature vectors, both of which have 1K-dimensionality, produces a million-dimensional feature vector. Therefore, for classification problems, the choice of the number of target classes is severely constrained, because the number of parameters for a standard linear classifier is determined by multiplication of the size of the high-dimensional feature vector and the number of target classes.\nCompact bilinear pooling (Gao et al., 2015) reduces the quadratic expansion of dimensionality by two orders of magnitude, retaining the performance of the full bilinear pooling. For example, compact bilinear pooling approximates 4K × 4K features using only 16K pooled features. This approximation uses sampling-based computation, Tensor Sketch Projection (Charikar et al., 2002; Pham & Pagh, 2013), which utilizes an useful property that Ψ(x⊗ y, h, s) = Ψ(x, h, s) ∗Ψ(y, h, s), which means the projection of outer product of two vectors is the convolution of two projected vectors.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n04 32\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\nHere, Ψ is the proposed projection function, and, h and s are randomly sampled parameters by the algorithm.\nNevertheless, compact bilinear pooling embraces two shortcomings. One comes from the sampling approach. Compact bilinear pooling relies on a favorable property, E[〈Ψ(x, h, s),Ψ(y, h, s)〉] = 〈x, y〉, which provides a basis to use projected features instead of original features. Yet, calculating the exact expectation is computationally intractable, so, the random parameters, h and s are fixed during training and evaluation. This practical choice leads to the second. The projected dimension of compact bilinear pooling should be large enough to minimize the bias from the fixed parameters. Practical choices are 10K and 16K for 512 and 4096-dimensional inputs, respectively (Gao et al., 2015; Fukui et al., 2016). Though, these compacted dimensions are reduced ones by two orders of magnitude compared with full bilinear pooling, such high-dimensional features could be a bottleneck for computationally complex models.\nWe propose low-rank bilinear neural networks using Hadamard product, which is commonly used in various scientific computing frameworks as one of tensor operations. The proposed method factors a three-dimensional weight tensor for bilinear pooling into three two-dimensional weight matrices, which enforces the rank of the weight tensor to be low-rank. As a result, two input feature vectors linearly projected by two weight matrices, respectively, are computed by Hadamard product, then, followed by a linear projection using the third weight matrix. For example, the projected vector z is represented by WTz (W T xx ◦WTyy), where ◦ denotes Hadamard product or element-wise multiplication.\nWe also explore to add non-linearity using non-linear activation functions into the low-rank bilinear neural networks, and shortcut connections inspired by deep residual learning (He et al., 2015). Then, we show that it becomes one-learning block of Multimodal Residual Networks (Kim et al., 2016b) as a low-rank bilinear model, yet, this interpretation has not be done.\nOur contributions are as follows: First, we propose low-rank bilinear neural networks to approximate full bilinear model. Second, Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear Attention Networks (MLB) having an attention mechanism using low-rank bilinear pooling is proposed for visual question-answering tasks. MLB achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, and has a better parsimonious property. Finally, ablation studies to explore alternative choices, e.g. network depth, non-linear functions, and shortcut connections, are conducted."

Notice that the number of parameters is L× (N ×M + 1) including a bias vector b, where L is the number of output features.\nPirsiavash et al. (2009) suggest a low-rank bilinear method to reduce the rank of the weight matrix Wi to have less number of parameters for regularization. They rewrite the weight matrix as Wi = UiV T i where U ∈ RN×d and V ∈ RM×d, which imposes a restriction on the rank of Wi to be at most d ≤ min(N,M). Based on this idea, fi can be rewritten as follows:\nfi = x TWiy + bi = x TUiV T i y + bi = 1 T (UTi x ◦VTi y) + bi (2) where 1 ∈ Rd denotes a column vector of ones, and ◦ denotes Hadamard product. Still, we need two third-order tensors, U and V, for a feature vector f , whose elements are {fi}. To reduce the order of the weight tensors by one, we replace 1 with P ∈ Rd×c and bi with b ∈ Rc to get a projected feature vector f ∈ Rc. Then, we get:\nf = PT (UTx ◦VTy) + b (3) where d and c are hyperparameters to decide the dimension of joint embeddings and the output dimension of low-rank bilinear models, respectively."

If two inputs come from different modalities, statistics of two inputs may be quite different from each other, which may result an interference. Since the gradient with respect to each input is directly dependent on the other input in Hadamard product of two inputs.\nAdditional applying an activation function after the Hadamard product is not appropriate, since activation functions doubly appear in calculating gradients.

      "heading" : "5 EXPERIMENTS",
      "text" : "In this section, we conduct six experiments to select the proposed model, Multimodal Low-rank Bilinear Attention Networks (MLB). Each experiment controls other factors except one factor to assess the effect on accuracies. Based on MRN (Kim et al., 2016b), we start our assessments with an initial option of G = 1 and shortcut connections of MRN, called as Multimodal Attention Residual Networks (MARN). Notice that we use one embeddings for each visual feature for better performance, based on our preliminary experiment (not shown). We attribute this choice to the attention mechanism for visual features, which provides more capacity to learn visual features. We use the same hyper-parameters of MRN (Kim et al., 2016b), without any explicit mention of this.\nThe VQA dataset (Antol et al., 2015) is used as a primary dataset, and, for data augmentation, question-answering annotations of Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016) are used. Validation is performed on the VQA test-dev split, and model comparison is based on the results of the VQA test-standard split. For the comprehensive reviews of VQA tasks, please refer to Wu et al. (2016a) and Kafle & Kanan (2016a).\nNumber of Learning Blocks Kim et al. (2016b) argue that three-block layered MRN shows the best performance among one to four-block layered models, taking advantage of residual learning. However, we speculate that an introduction of attention mechanism makes deep networks hard to optimize. Therefore, we explore the number of learning blocks of MARN, which have an attention mechanism using low-rank bilinear pooling.\nNumber of Glimpses Fukui et al. (2016) show that the attention mechanism of two glimpses was an optimal choice. In a similar way, we assess one, two, and four-glimpse models.\nNon-Linearity We assess three options applying non-linearity on low-rank bilinear pooling, vanilla, before Hadamard product as in Equation 5, and after Hadamard product as in Equation 6.\nAnswer Sampling VQA (Antol et al., 2015) dataset has ten answers from unique persons for each question, while Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016) dataset has a single answer for each question. Since difficult or ambiguous questions may have divided answers, the probabilistic sampling from the distribution of answers can be utilized to optimize for the multiple answers. An instance 1 can be found in Fukui et al. (2016). We simplify the procedure as follows:\np(a1) = { |a1|/Σi|ai|, if |a1| ≥ 3 0, otherwise\n(12)\np(a0) = 1− p(a1) (13) where |ai| denotes the number of unique answer ai in a set of multiple answers, a0 denotes a mode, which is the most frequent answer, and a1 denotes the secondly most frequent answer. We define the divided answers as having at least three answers which are the secondly frequent one, for the evaluation metric of VQA (Antol et al., 2015),\naccuracy(ak) = min (|ak|/3, 1) . (14) 1https://github.com/akirafukui/vqa-mcb/blob/5fea8/train/multi_att_2_\nglove/vqa_data_provider_layer.py#L130\nThe rate of the divided answers is approximately 16.40%, and only 0.23% of questions have more than two divided answers in VQA dataset. We assume that it eases the difficulty of convergence without severe degradation of performance.\nShortcut Connection The performance contribution of shortcut connections for residual learning is explored. This experiment is conducted based on the observation of the competitive performance of single-block layered model. Since the usefulness of shortcut connections is linked to the network depth (He et al., 2015).\nData Augmentation The data augmentation with Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016) question answer annotations is explored. Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016) originally provides 1.7 Million visual question answer annotations. After aligning to VQA, the valid number of question-answering pairs for training is 837,298, which is for distinct 99,280 images."

For the multiple glimpse models in the next experiment, we choose one-block layered model for its simplicity to extend, and competitive performance (63.79%).\nNumber of Glimpses Compared with the results of Fukui et al. (2016), four-glimpse MARN (64.61%) is better than other comparative models. However, for a parsimonious choice, two-glimpse MARN (64.53%) is chosen for later experiments. We speculate that multiple glimpses are one of key factors for the competitive performance of MCB (Fukui et al., 2016), based on a large margin in accuracy, compared to one-glimpse MARN (63.79%).\nNon-Linearity The results confirm that activation functions are useful to improve performances. Surprisingly, there is no empirical difference between two options, before-Hadamard product and after-Hadamard product. This result may build a bridge to relate with studies on multiplicative integration with recurrent neural networks (Wu et al., 2016c).\nAnswer Sampling Sampled answers (64.80%) result better performance than mode answers (64.53%). It confirms that the distribution of answers from annotators can be used to improve the performance. However, the number of multiple answers is usually limited due to the cost of data collection.\nShortcut Connection Though, MRN (Kim et al., 2016b) effectively uses shortcut connections to improve model performance, one-block layered MARN shows better performance without the shortcut connection. In other words, the residual learning is not used in our proposed model, MLB. It seems that there is a trade-off between introducing attention mechanism and residual learning. We leave a careful study on this trade-off for future work.\nData Augmentation Data augmentation using Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2016) question answer annotations significantly improves the performance by 0.76% in accuracy for VQA test-dev split.

Although the dimensions of x and y are different from each other, one can easily generalize compact bilinear pooling for multimodal learning (Fukui et al., 2016).\nMCB (Fukui et al., 2016) for VQA tasks needs to set the dimension of output d to 16,000, to reduce the bias induced by the fixed random variables h and s. As a result, the majority of model parameters (16K × 3K = 48M) are concentrated on the last fully connected layer, which makes a fan-out structure. So, the total number of parameters of MCB is highly sensitive to the number of classes, which is approximately 69.2M for MCB+att, and 70.5M for MCB+att+GloVe.

However, bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear neural networks using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), commonly implemented in many scientific computing frameworks. We show that our model outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks, having a better parsimonious property.",
