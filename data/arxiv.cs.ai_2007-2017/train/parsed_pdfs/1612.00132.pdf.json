      "text" : "Many vision problems have ambiguous solutions. There are many motion fields consistent with an image [19, 25, 26]. Similarly, there are many shading fields consistent with the layout of an image (Figure 1); many good ways to colorize an image [3, 27, 29]; many possible ways to adjust the saturation of an image (Figure 1); many possible long term futures for an image frame [30]; and so on. For each of these problems, one must output a spatial field Y for an input image X; but Y is not uniquely determined by X . Worse, Y has complex spatial structure (for example, saturation at a pixel is typically similar to the saturation at the next pixel, except over boundaries). It is natural to build a generative model of Y , conditioned on X , and draw samples from that model. Towards this end, recent work has modified a strong generative model for images that uses latent variables, the\nvariational auto-encoder (VAE) of [7], to produce a conditional VAE (CVAE) [19, 25, 26]. The very high dimension and complex spatial covariances of Y are managed by the underlying latent variable model in the CVAE.\nHowever, building a good conditional model still poses some challenges. In most practical vision problems, the training dataset we can access is “scattered”, and the model is multimodal. Scattered training data consists of pairs of (yi, xi), but we never see multiple different values of yi for one particular xi. Practical vision models compute some intermediate representation c(x) (which we call the “code”), and predict y from that intermediate representation and a random (or latent) variable u. Write y = F (u; c(x)). The hope is that different choices of the random variable will produce different values of y, and we can therefore predict the entire gamut of outputs (shading, motion field, saturation etc.). This implies that the method can represent a multimodal P (Y |X).\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n00 13\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n8 M\nar 2\n01 7\nThis setting presents a difficulty. To build a plausible conditional model, we must smooth. The model smooths by allowing examples with similar codes to “share” y values. In turn, the choice of code is crucial, and a poor choice of code can result in a method that appears to work well, but does not. Figure 2 illustrates this point. The figure shows two possible choices of code for a particular dataset. In the good choice of code, F is forced to use the random variable to produce distinct values of y for similar x, because similar x result in similar codes. In the poor choice of code, similar x can have different codes (viz. different codes A and B for similar x in the right side of Figure 2) and vice versa. Then, F can largely ignore the random variable, but simulates a multimodal process by producing very different y for quite similar x using the different c(x). This means the network we have trained will (a) not be effective at making diverse predictions and (b) may change its prediction very significantly for a small change in x, in a manner that is uncontrolled by the code. This is not desirable behavior.\nWe call the effect “code collapse”, because the network is encouraged to produce similar codes for different inputs. The result is a model with imperfect diversity and generalization, but good loss on scattered training data. The absence of variance, in what should be a diverse pool of output predictions, is a strong diagnostic indicator of code collapse. We exploit this indicator and show that our baselines, particularly the CVAE, generate low variance and therefore suffer from code collapse (Section 5.2, Figure 5).\nThe key problem, resulting in code collapse, is that the current training procedures have no term to force a good choice of codes. For example, VAE loss requires the code distribution to look like a standard normal distribution. This loss does not force it to preserve the similarity, dissimilar input images can be closer and similar inputs further apart in the code space. Recent work shows that better generative models are obtained by conditioning on text-\nembeddings [15] or pre-trained features from visual recognition network [12]. This suggests that using an embedding with some structure is better than conditioning on raw pixels (with high-capacity networks).\nIn our approach, instead of using a fixed embedding as input, we use raw pixels but guide the codes (or intermediate representation) with a metric constraint. Our metric term encourages codes c(x) for distinct x to be different and codes for similar x to be similar. This prevents code collapse. To ensure that F (u; c(x)) will vary for similar c(x), we use a Mixture Density Network (MDN) [2]. MDN explicitly models a multimodal conditional distribution. We call our model CDVAE (Co-Embedding Deep Variational Auto Encoder).\nWe apply CDVAE to two novel (from the point of view of automated editing) problems: (a) Photo Relighting, (b) Image Resaturation (Section 4). In relighting (or reshading), we decompose the image into shading and albedo, then produce a new shading field consistent with the albedo field. In resaturation, we produce a new saturation field and apply it to the image. In each case, the resulting image should look “natural” – like a real image, but differently illuminated (reshading) or with differently color saturated objects (resaturation). In all cases, our model outperforms strong baselines (including the CVAE).\nContributions:\n• We describe a novel method to build conditional models for extremely demanding datasets (Section 3, Figure 3) and apply it to photo-editing tasks (Section 4).\n• We show how to regularize our model so that the latent representation is not distorted, and this helps us improve results (Section 3.2 and Figure 5).\n• Our method is compared to a variety of strong baselines, and produces predictions that (a) have high variance and (b) have high accuracy (Section 5.3 and Section 5.2). Our method clearly outperforms existing models.\n• Training previous conditional models is hard, these models tend to either go to code collapse or random prediction. Our methods can avoid code collapse and create multiple distinct plausible results (Section 5.4 and Figure 6)."

      "text" : "Generating a spatial field with complex spatial structure from an image is an established problem. Important application examples, where the prediction is naturally ambiguous, include colorization [4, 9, 29], style transfer [5], temporal transformations prediction [30], predicting motion fields [19, 25, 26], and predicting future frames [24].\nThis is usually treated as a regression problem; current state of the art methods use deep networks to learn features. However, predicting the expected value of a conditional distribution, through regression, works poorly, because the expected value of a multimodal distribution may have low probability. While one might temper the distribution (eg [29]), the ideal is to obtain multiple different solutions.\nOne strategy is to draw samples from a generative model. Generative models of images present problems of dimension; these can be addressed with latent variable models, leading to the variational autoencoder (VAE) of [7]. As the topic attracts jargon, we review the standard VAE briefly here. This approach learns an encoder E that maps data x into a continuous latent variable z = E(x) (the codes), and a decoder D that maps z to an image x̂ = D(z). Learning ensures that (a) x and D(E(x)) are close; (b) if ξ is close to z, then D(ξ) is close to D(z); and (c) z is distributed like a standard normal random variable. Images can then be generated by sampling a standard normal distribution to get ξ, and forming D(ξ). This is a latent variable model, modelling P (x) as P (x) = ∫ z P (x|z)P (z)dz. P (x|z) is represented by the decoder, we use an auxiliary distribution Q = P (z|x) for P (z), where P (z|x) is now the encoder. Learning is by maximizing a lower-bound on log-likelihood (Equation 1)\nVAE(θ) = ∑ data EQ[logP (x|z)]− D(Q||P (z)) (1)\nwhere θ are the parameters of encoder and decoder networks of the VAE.\nCurrent generative models are reliable in simple do-\nmains (handwritten digits [7, 18]; faces [7, 8, 16]; and CIFAR images [6]) but less so for general images. Improvements are available using multiple layers of latent variables (a DVAE) [16]. Models can be trained with adversarial loss [14]. However, these deep models are still hard to train. The ladder VAE imposes both top-down and bottom up variational distributions for more efficient training [20].\nThe generative model needs to be conditioned on an image, and needs to be multimodal. Tang et al. give a multimodal conditional model [21], but the conditioning variables are binary. A conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) [19] conditions the decoder model on a continuous representation produced by a network applied to x. This approach has been demonstrated on motion prediction problems [25, 30].\nWe use the mixture density network (MDN) in our models to capture the underlying multimodal distribution [2]. MDN predicts the parameters of a mixture of gaussians from real-valued input features. MDNs have been successfully applied to articulatory-acoustic inversion mapping [17, 22] and speech synthesis [28]."

      "text" : "Our CDVAE consists of two deep variational auto encoders (DVAE) [16] and a mixture density network (MDN) [2]. An overview of the CDVAE model is shown in Figure 3.\nOur architecture is, we use two DVAEs to embed the conditioning image xc (or X from Section 1) and the generated image xg (or Y from Section 1) into two lowdimensional latent variables (or code spaces) zc and zg . The\ngenerated image corresponds to output spatial field viz. saturation or shading etc. and the conditioning image is the input image viz. intensity or albedo etc. Next, we regularize the latent variables zc with embedding guidance (or metric constraints) such that the similarity in input space is maintained (Section 3.2). Since our problem is ambiguous, the conditional distribution between zg and zc is multimodal. MDN allows us to fit a multimodal gaussian mixture model (GMM) between the conditioning code zc and the generated code zg (Section 3.1). At test time, we sample from this multimodal GMM (zg ∼ MDN ) and use the decoder of the generated image DVAE (Decoder(zg)) to predict different shading, saturation for a single input image.\nIn Figure 3, we simplify and show a single layer of latent variables. In practice, our DVAE utilizes multiple layers of gaussian latent variables. This hierarchical variational auto encoder architecture captures complex structure in the data, and provides good practical performance.\nWe jointly train the two DVAEs and the MDN, allowing them to adapt and mutually benefit each other. Joint training also enables CDVAE to model a joint probability distribution of xc and xg , instead of a conditional probability distribution (viz. like a CVAE). The joint probability model allows for more smoothing between data points. In CDVAE, we optimize the joint probability model P (xc, xg) during training (Refer Equation 25). At test time, we remove the decoder for the conditioning layer and the encoder for the generated layer. This converts the joint model of CDVAE into a conditional model P (xg|xc). We can then sample this conditional model to generate diverse outputs. Similar to VAE probability model, we write the joint probability by marginalizing over the joint distribution P (zg, zc)\nP (xc,xg)= ∫ zc ∫ zg P (xc|zc)P (xg|zg)P (zg,zc)dzgdzc (2) In Section 3.1, we derive the loss terms corresponding to\nthis joint probability model of CDVAE."

Additionally, we have an MDN that models the relationship between the embeddings zc and zg . The loss function LCDV AE corresponding to the CDVAE joint model P (xc, xg) is a combination of the two DVAE models and the conditional probability model of MDN. In Equations 1 and 25, assume it is possible to encode xc without seeing xg , then we can use the auxiliary sampling distribution Q = P (zc|xc)P (zg|xg) for our CDVAE. If P (zg, zc) = P (zg)P (zc) in Equation 25, we can separate out the product terms of joint probability model. Taking negative log-likelihood, we obtain separate additive loss terms for each DVAE. Write DVAE(θ) for the\nloss function of a DVAE with weights (or parameters) θ, which has the standard form of a VAE loss (Equation 1). Write the loss of the DVAE for the generated image xg as DVAE(θg) (similarly for xc). Write loss for the MDN as Lmdn.

      "text" : "Vanilla DVAEs have difficulty in learning a code space which encodes the complex spatial structure of the output. The code space learned by a DVAE appears to be underdetermined, especially for large and complex datasets. This is a common failure mode of VAEs. For our conditional models, it is desirable that codes for “similar” inputs are nearby, and codes for “very different” inputs are further apart. This discourages the method from grouping together very different inputs. It also prevents similar images from having\ndifferent codes, and therefore avoids incorrect smoothing of the model (See Figure 2). We guide the codes (at multiple layers) to be similar to a pre-computed embedding. Our pre-computed embedding is such that it preserves the similarity observed in input domain. Refer to Figure 4 and supplementary material for the details of our pre-computed embedding. Write p for the pre-computed embedding and zc for the gaussian latent variables of the network.

We post process generated images for viewing at high resolution (not used in any quantitative evaluation). Our post processing upsamples results to a resolution of 512 × 512, with more details. We aggressively upsample the generated fields with the approach in [10], which preserves edges during upsampling. In particular, the method represents a high resolution field by a weight and an orientation value at each sample point; these parameters control a basis function placed at each sample, and the field at any test point is a sum of the values of the basis functions at that point. The sum of basis functions includes only those basis functions in the same image segment. Write Interp(w, θ;S(I)) for the high resolution field produced by interpolating a weight vector w and a vector of orientations θ, assuming a segment mask S(I) obtained from the high resolution grey level image. Write Y (d) for a low resolution field produced by the decoder, and ↓ Gσ∗ for a process that smooths and downsamples. We solve\n↓ Gσ ∗ (Interp(w, θ;S(I))) = Y (d)\nfor w, θ, regularizing with the magnitude of w. This produces a high resolution field that (a) is compatible with the high resolution edges of the grey level image (unlike the learned upsampling in common use) and (b) produces the decoder sample when smoothed.\nFor relighting and saturation adjustment tasks, we polish images for display by using detail maps to recover fine scale details. The detail map is calculated by taking the conditioning image Ic and subtracting the output produced by the conditioning image decoder with the code zc.

We decompose the image into albedo (the conditioning image xc), and shading (the generated image xg). In real images, shading is quite strongly conditioned by albedo because the albedo image contains semantic information such as the scene categories, object layout and potential light sources. A scene can be lighted in multiple ways, so relighting is a multimodal problem. We use the MS-COCO dataset for relighting (Section 5.1).\nImage Resaturation: Here, we predict new saturation fields for color images, i.e. we modify color saturation for some or all objects in the image. We transform the input RGB color image into HSV color space, and use the value channel as our conditioning image and the saturation channel as our generated image. We use CDVAE to generate new saturation fields consistent with the input value image. Combining the new saturation fields with H and V channels leads to new versions of an image, with edited saturation. See the grilled cheese on the broccoli in Figure 1 which demonstrates that we obtain natural edits. Again, we use the MS-COCO dataset for this application (Section 5.1)."

      "text" : "Error-of-Best to ground truth: We follow the motion prediction work [25] to use error-of-best to ground truth as an evaluation metric. We draw 100 samples for each conditional model and calculate the minimum per pixel error to ground truth fields. A better model will produce smaller values, because it should produce some samples closer to the ground truth.\nVariance: A key goal of our paper is to generate diverse solutions. However, no current evaluation regime can tell whether a pool of diverse solutions is right. We opt for the strictly weaker proxy of measuring variance in the pool, on the reasonable assumption that diverse predictions for our problems must have high variance. Thus, procedures that produce low variance predictions are clearly unacceptable. Clearly, it is not enough just to produce variance – we want the pool to contain appealing diverse predictions. To assess this, we rely on qualitative evaluations (Figures 6, 7, 8). The supplementary materials contain many additional qualitative results.\nTo compute variance, we obtain the values for 16 (4× 4) equally spaced grid (since distant pixels are de-correlated to some extent) of pixels in our 32× 32 prediction. We collect these values across 100 samples, and compute the variance at each grid point across samples. We report this average variance vs. minimum error (See Figure 5). In particular, a method with more diverse output predictions should result in higher variances and one of them should also be close to the ground-truth (therefore, low minimum error). Specifically, we need to be in the bottom-right part of Figure 5, which our CDVAE achieves.\nTherefore, our CDVAE model creates results with desirable properties: lower error-of-best to ground truth and large variance. Our CDVAE model produces better results with more gaussian kernels (CDVAE12 vs. CDVAE4) and performance drops (higher minimum error and low variance) when no embedding guidance is used (CDVAE4 noemb)."

Gaussian smoothing is ap-\nplied to returned xg to remove inconsistent high frequency signal. Since our training data does not have explicit oneto-many correspondences, NN is a natural strong baseline. It is a non-parametric method to model multimodal distribution by borrowing output spatial fields (we also smooth these) from nearby input images.\nConditional variational autoencoder: We implement a CVAE similar to [25]. We cannot use [25] since their architecture is specific to prediction of coarse motion trajectories. Our decoder is modelled on the DCGAN architecture of Radford et al. [14] with 5 deconvolution layers, and we use codes of dimension 64 (to be consistent with CDVAE). Our image tower and encoder tower use 5 convolutional layers (mirror image of the decoder). We use the same strategy as [25], i.e. we spatially replicate code from encoder and multiply it to the output of image tower. The decoder takes as input the result of this. We train our CVAE with the standard pixel-wise L2 loss on output and KL-divergence loss on the code space. At test time, codes are randomly sampled from the normal distribution.\nConditional GAN: CGAN [11] is another conditional image generation model. It uses a regularized code (drawn from a uniform distribution) along with a fixed embedding of the conditioning image as input. We observe that CGAN achieves higher minimum error (or error-of-best) and lower variance as compared to CDVAE (See Figure 5). Therefore, we generate better (lower minimum error) and more diverse (higher variance) predictions that CGAN. These metrics are explained in detail in Section 5.2.\nConditional PixelCNN (CPixel): Conditional PixelCNN [23] uses masked and gated convolutions (sigmoid and tanh activations layers multiplied). The receptive field of masked convolutions mimics the causal dependency and gated convolutions approximate the behavior of LSTM gates in recurrent architectures. Therefore, PixelCNN (CPixel) feasibly approximates the compute intensive recurrent architectures [6] for image generation. However, their receptive field grows linearly and handling long-scale effects is difficult. Our results are qualitatively better than PixelCNN, we believe our DVAE with fully-connected layers is better at capturing the global structure given the coarse resolution used. Note, our CDVAE has lower minimum error than PixelCNN (Figure 5)."

    "abstractText" : "Problems such as predicting a new shading field (Y ) for an image (X) are ambiguous: many very distinct solutions are good. Representing this ambiguity requires building a conditional model P (Y |X) of the prediction, conditioned on the image. Such a model is difficult to train, because we do not usually have training data containing many different shadings for the same image. As a result, we need different training examples to share data to produce good models. This presents a danger we call “code space collapse” — the training procedure produces a model that has a very good loss score, but which represents the conditional distribution poorly. We demonstrate an improved method for building conditional models by exploiting a metric constraint on training data that prevents code space collapse. We demonstrate our model on two example tasks using real data: image saturation adjustment, image relighting. We describe quantitative metrics to evaluate ambiguous generation results. Our results quantitatively and qualitatively outperform different strong baselines.",
