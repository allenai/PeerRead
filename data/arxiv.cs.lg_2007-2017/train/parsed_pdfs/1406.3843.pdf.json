      "text" : "Bayesian statistics provides a natural way to manage model complexity and control overfitting, with modern problems involving complicated models with a large number of parameters. One of the most powerful advantages of the Bayesian approach is hierarchical modeling, which allows partial pooling across a group of datasets, allowing groups with little data to borrow information from similar groups with larger amounts of data. However, such models pose problems for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, because the joint posterior distribution is often pathological due to strong correlations between the model parameters and the hyperparameters [3]. For example, one of the most powerful MCMC methods is Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). However, for hierarchical models even the mixing speed of HMC can be unsatisfactory in practice, as has been noted several times in the literature [3, 4, 11]. Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) [7] is a recent extension of HMC that aims to efficiently sample from challenging posterior distributions by exploiting local geometric properties of the distribution of interest. However, it is computationally too expensive to be applicable to large scale problems. In this work, we propose a simplified RMHMC method, called Semi-Separable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SSHMC), in which the joint Hamiltonian over parameters and hyperparameters has special structure, which we call semi-separability, that allows it to be decomposed into two simpler, separable Hamiltonians. This condition allows for a new efficient algorithm which we call the alternating blockwise leapfrog algorithm. Compared to Gibbs sampling, SSHMC can make significantly larger moves in hyperparameter space due to shared terms between the two simple Hamiltonians. Compared to previous RMHMC methods, SSHMC yields simpler and more computationally efficient samplers for many practical Bayesian models."

(1)\nThis hierarchical Bayesian model is popular because the parameters θi for each group are coupled, allowing the groups to share statistical strength. However, this property causes difficulties when approximating the posterior distribution. In the posterior, the model parameters and hyperparameters are strongly correlated. In particular, φ usually controls the variance of p(θ|φ) to promote partial pooling, so the variance of θ|φ,D depends strongly on φ. This causes difficulties for many MCMC methods, such as the Gibbs sampler and HMC. An illustrative example of pathological structure in hierarchical models is the Gaussian funnel distribution [11]. Its density function is defined as p(x, v) = ∏n i=1N (xi|0, e−v)N (v|0, 32), where x is the vector of low-level parameters and v is the variance hyperparameters. The pathological correlation between x and v is illustrated by Figure 1."

      "text" : "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a gradient-based MCMC method with auxiliary variables. To generate samples from a target density π(z), HMC constructs an ergodic Markov chain with the invariant distribution π(z, r) = π(z)π(r), where r is an auxiliary variable. The most common choice of π(r) is a Gaussian distribution N (0, G−1) with precision matrix G. Given the current sample z, the transition kernel of the HMC chain includes three steps: first sample r ∼ π(r), second propose a new sample (z′, r′) by simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics and finally accept the proposed sample with probability α = min {1, π(z′, r′)/π(z, r)}, otherwise leave z unchanged. The last step is a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction. Define H(z, r) := − log π(z, r). The Hamiltonian dynamics is defined by the differential equations ż = ∂rH ṙ = −∂zH , where z is called the position and r is called the momentum.\nIt is easy to see that Ḣ(z, r) = ∂zH ż +∂rH ṙ = 0, which is called the energy preservation property [10, 11]. In physics, H(z, r) is known as the Hamiltonian energy, and is decomposed into the sum of the potential energy U(z) := − log π(z) and the kinetic energy K(r) := − log π(r). The most used discretized simulation in HMC is the leapfrog algorithm, which is given by the recursion\nr(τ + /2) = r(τ)− 2 ∇zU(τ) (2a)\nz(τ + ) = z(τ) + ∇rK(τ + /2) (2b) r(τ + ) = r(τ + /2)−\n2 ∇θU(τ + ), (2c)\nwhere is the step size of discretized simulation time. After L steps from the current sample (z(0), r(0)) = (z, r), the new sample is proposed as the last point (z′, r′) = (z(L ), r(L )). In Hamiltonian dynamics, the matrix G is called the mass matrix. If G is constant w.r.t. z, then z and r are independent in π(z, r). In this case we say that H(z, r) is a separable Hamiltonian. In particular, we use the term standard HMC to refer to HMC using the identity matrix as G. Although HMC methods often outperform other popular MCMC methods, they may mix slowly if there are strong correlations between variables in the target distribution. Neal [11] showed that HMC can mix faster if G is not the identity matrix. Intuitively, such a G acts like a preconditioner. However, if the curvature of π(z) varies greatly, a global preconditioner can be inadequate. For this reason, recent work, notably that on Riemannian manifold HMC (RMHMC) [7], has considered non-separable Hamiltonian methods, in which G(z) varies with position z, so that z and r are no longer independent in π(z, r). The resulting Hamiltonian H(z, r) = − log π(z, r) is called a non-separable Hamiltonian. For example, for Bayesian inference problems, Girolami et al. [7] proposed using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) of π(θ), which is the metric tensor of posterior manifold. However, for a non-separable Hamiltonian, the simple leapfrog dynamics (2a)-(2c) do not yield a valid MCMC method, as they are no longer reversible. Simulation of general non-separable systems requires the generalized leapfrog integrator (GLI) [7], which requires computing higher order derivatives to solve a system of non-linear differential equations. The computational cost of GLI in general is O(d3) where d is the number of parameters, which is prohibitive for large d.\nIn hierarchical models, there are two ways to sample the posterior using HMC. One way is to sample the joint posterior π(θ,φ) directly. The other way is to sample the conditional π(θ|φ) and π(φ|θ), simulating from each conditional distribution using HMC. This strategy is called HMC within Gibbs [11]. In either case, HMC chains tend to mix slowly in hyperparameter space, because the huge variation of potential energy across different hyperparameter values can easily overwhelm the kinetic energy in separable HMC [11]. Hierarchical models also pose a challenge to RMHMC, if we want to sample the model parameters and hyperparameters jointly. In particular, the closed-form FIM of the joint posterior π(θ,φ) is usually unavailable. Due to this problem, even sampling some toy models like the Gaussian funnel using RMHMC becomes challenging. Betancourt [2] proposed a new metric that uses a transformed Hessian matrix of π(θ), and Betancourt and Girolami [3] demonstrate the power of this method for efficiently sampling hyperparameters of hierarchical models on some simple benchmarks like Gaussian funnel. However, the transformation requires computing eigendecomposition of the Hessian matrix, which is infeasible in high dimensions. Because of these technical difficulties, RMHMC for hierarchical models is usually used within a block Gibbs sampling scheme, alternating between θ and φ. This RMHMC within Gibbs strategy is useful because the simulation of the non-separable dynamics for the conditional distributions may have much lower computational cost than that for the joint one. However, as we have discussed, in hierarchical models these variables tend be very strongly correlated, and it is well-known that Gibbs samplers mix slowly in such cases [13]. So, the Gibbs scheme limits the true power of RMHMC."

      "text" : "In this section, we define the semi-separable Hamiltonian system. Our target distribution will be the posterior π(θ,φ) = log p(θ,φ|D) of a hierarchical model (1), where θ ∈ Rn and φ ∈ Rm. Let (rθ, rφ) ∈ Rm+n be the vector of momentum variables corresponding to θ and φ respectively. The non-separable Hamiltonian is defined as\nH(θ,φ, rθ, rφ) = U(θ,φ) +K(rθ, rφ|θ,φ), (3) where the potential energy is U(θ,φ) = − log π(θ,φ) and the kinetic energy is K(rθ, rφ|θ,φ) = − logN (rθ, rφ; 0, G(θ,φ)−1), which includes the normalization term log |G(θ,φ)|. The mass matrix G(θ,φ) can be an arbitrary p.d. matrix. For example, previous work on RMHMC [7] has chosen G(θ,φ) to be FIM of the joint posterior π(θ,φ), resulting in an HMC method that requires O ( (m+ n) 3 ) time. This limits applications of RMHMC to large scale problems.\nTo attack these computational challenges, we introduce restrictions on the mass matrix G(θ,φ) to enable efficient simulation. In particular, we restrict G(θ,φ) to have the form\nG(θ,φ) =\n( Gθ(φ,x) 0\n0 Gφ(θ)\n) ,\nwhere Gθ and Gφ are the precision matrices of rθ and rφ, respectively. Importantly, we restrict Gθ(φ,x) to be independent of θ and Gφ(θ) to be independent of φ. If G has these properties, we call the resulting Hamiltonian a semi-separable Hamiltonian. A semi-separable Hamiltonian is still in general non-separable, as the two random vectors (θ,φ) and (rθ, rφ) are not independent. The semi-separability property has important computational advantages. First, because G is block diagonal, the cost of matrix operations reduces from O((n + m)k) to O(nk). Second, and more important, substituting the restricted mass matrix into (3) results in the potential and kinetic energy:\nU(θ,φ) = − ∑ i [log p(yi|θi,xi) + log p(θi|φ)]− log p(φ), (4)\nK(rθ, rφ|φ,θ) = 1\n2 [rTθGθ(x,φ)rθ + r T φGφ(θ)rφ + log |Gθ(x,φ)|+ log |Gφ(θ)|]. (5)\nIf we fix (θ, rθ) or (φ, rφ), the non-separable Hamiltonian (3) can be seen as a separable Hamiltonian plus some constant terms. In particular, define the notation\nA(rθ|φ) = 1\n2 rTθGθ(x,φ)rθ, A(rφ|θ) =\n1 2 rTφGφ(θ)rφ.\nThen, considering (φ, rφ) as fixed, the non-separable Hamiltonian H in (3) is different from the following separable Hamiltonian\nH1(θ, rθ) = U1(θ|φ, rφ) +K1(rθ|φ), (6) U1(θ|φ, rφ) = − ∑ i [log p(yi|θi,xi) + log p(θi|φ)] +A(rφ|θ) + 1 2 log |Gφ(θ)| , (7)\nK1(rθ|φ) = A(rθ|φ) (8) only by some constant terms that do not depend on (θ, rθ). What this means is that any update to (θ, rθ) that leaves H1 invariant leaves the joint Hamiltonian H invariant as well. An example is the leapfrog dynamics on H1, where U1 is considered the potential energy, and K1 the kinetic energy. Similarly, if (θ, rθ) are fixed, then H differs from the following separable Hamiltonian\nH2(φ, rφ) = U2(φ|θ, rθ) +K2(rφ|θ), (9) U2(φ|θ, rθ) = − ∑ i log p(θi|φ)− log p(φ) +A(rθ|φ) + 1 2 log |Gθ(x,φ)| , (10)\nK2(rφ|θ) = A(rφ|θ) (11) only by terms that are constant with respect to (φ, rφ). Notice thatH1 andH2 are coupled by the terms A(rθ|φ) and A(rφ|θ). Each of these terms appears in the kinetic energy of one of the separable Hamiltonians, but in the potential energy of the other one. We call these terms auxiliary potentials because they are potential energy terms introduced by the auxiliary variables. These auxiliary potentials are key to our method (see Section 4.3).\n4.2 Alternating block-wise leapfrog algorithm432 433 434 435 436 437 438 439 440 441 442 443 444 445 446 447 448 449 450 451 452 453 454 455 456 457 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 472 473 474 475 476 477 478 479 480 481 482 483 484 485 choices of mass matrix within the semi-separable framework, or the use of SSHMC within discrete models, following previous work in discrete HMC [12, 15].

As described in the previous section, any update to (θ, rθ) that leaves H1 invariant also leaves the joint Hamiltonian H invariant, as does any update to (φ, rφ) that leaves H2 invariant. So a natural idea is simply to alternate between simulating the Hamiltonian dynamics for H1 and that for H2. Crucially, even though the total HamiltonianH is not separable in general, both H1 and H2 are separable. Therefore when simulating H1 and H2, the simple leapfrog method can be used, and the more complex GLI method is not required. We call this method the alternating block-wise leapfrog algorithm (ABLA), shown in Algorithm 1. In this figure the function “leapfrog” returns the result of the leapfrog dynamics (2a)-(2c) for the given starting point, Hamiltonian, and step size. We call each iteration of the loop from 1 . . . L an ALBA step. For simplicity, we have shown one leapfrog step for H1 and H2 for each ALBA step, but in practice it is useful to use multiple leapfrog steps per ALBA step. ABLA has discretization error due to the leapfrog discretization, so the MH correction is required. If it is possible to simulateH1 andH2 exactly, thenH is preserved exactly and there is no need for MH correction. To show that the SSHMC method by ALBA preserves the distribution π(θ,φ), we also need to show the ABLA is a time-reversible and volume-preserving transformation in the joint space of (θ, rθ,φ, rφ). LetX = Xθ,rθ×Xφ,rφ where (θ, rθ) ∈ Xθ,rθ and (φ, rφ) ∈ Xφ,rφ . Obviously, any reversible and volume-preserving transformation in a subspace of X is also reversible and volumepreserving in X . It is easy to see that each leapfrog step in the ABLA algorithm is reversible and volume-preserving in either Xθ,rθ or Xφ,rφ . One more property of integrator of interest is\n4\nsymplecticity. Because each leapfrog integrator is symplectic in the subspace of X [10], they are also symplectic in X . Then because ABLA is a composition of symplectic leapfrog integrators, and the composition of symplectic transformations is symplectic, we know ABLA is symplectic. We emphasize that ABLA is actually not a discretized simulation of the semi-separable Hamiltonian systemH , that is, if starting at a point (θ, rθ,φ, rφ) in the joint space, we run the exact Hamiltonian dynamics for H for a length of time L, the resulting point will not be the same as that returned by ALBA at time L even if the discretized time step is infinitely small. For example, ALBA simulates H1 with step size 1 and H2 with step size 2 where 1 = 2 2, when 2 → 0 that preserves H ."

      "text" : "Although the SSHMC method may seem similar to RMHMC within Gibbs (RMHMCWG), SSHMC is actually very different. The difference is in the last two terms of (7) and (10); if these are omitted from SSHMC and the Hamiltonians for π(θ|φ), then we obtain HMC within Gibbs. Particularly important among these two terms is the auxiliary potential, because it allows each of the separable Hamiltonian systems to borrow energy from the other one. For example, if the previous leapfrog step increases the kinetic energy K1(rθ|φ) in H1(θ, rθ), then, in the next leapfrog step for H2(φ, rφ), we see that φ will have greater potential energy U2(φ|θ, rθ), because the auxiliary potential A(rθ|φ) is shared. That allows the leapfrog step to accommodate a larger change of log p(φ|θ) using A(rθ|φ). So, the chain will mix faster in Xφ. By the symmetry of θ and φ, the auxiliary potential will also accelerate the mixing in Xθ. Another way to see this is that the dynamics in RMHMCWG for (rφ,φ) preserves the distribution π(θ, rφ,φ) = π(θ,φ)N (rφ; 0, Gφ(φ)−1) but not the joint π(θ,φ, rθ, rφ). That is because the Gibbs sampler does not take into account the effect of φ on rθ. In other words, the Gibbs step has the stationary distribution π(φ, rφ|θ) rather than π(φ, rφ|θ, rθ). The difference between the two is the auxiliary potential. In contrast, the SSHMC methods preserve the Hamiltonian of π(θ,φ, rθ, rφ)."

      "heading" : "4.4 Choice of mass matrix",
      "text" : "The choice of Gθ and Gφ in SSHMC is usually similar to RMHMCWG. If the Hessian matrix of − log p(θ|y,x,φ) is independent of θ and always p.d., it is natural to defineGθ as the inverse of the Hessian matrix. However, for some popular models, e.g., logistic regression, the Hessian matrix of the likelihood function depends on the parameters θ. In this case, one can use any approximate Hessian B, like the Hessian at the mode, and define Gθ := (B +B(φ))−1, where B(φ) is the Hessian of the prior distribution. Such a rough approximation is usually good enough to improve the mixing speed, because the main difficulty is the correlation between model parameters and hyperparameters. In general, because the computational bottleneck in HMC and SSHMC is computing the gradient of the target distribution, both methods have the same computational complexity O(lg), where g is the cost of computing the gradient and l is the total number of leapfrog steps per iteration. However, in practice we find it very beneficial to use multiple steps in each blockwise leapfrog update in ALBA; this can cause SSHMC to require more time than HMC. Also, depending on the mass matrixGθ, the cost of leapfrog a step in ABLA may be different from those in standard HMC. For some choices of Gθ, the leapfrog step in ABLA can be even faster than one leapfrog step of HMC. For example, in many models the computational bottleneck is the gradient ∇φ logZ(φ), Z(φ) is the normalization in prior. Recall that Gθ is a function of φ. If |Gθ| = Z(φ)−1, Z(φ) will be canceled out, avoiding computation of ∇φ logZ(φ). One example is using Gx = evI in Gaussian funnel distribution aforementioned in Section 2. A potential problem of such Gθ is that the curvature of the likelihood function p(D|θ) is ignored. But when the data in each group is sparse and the parameters θ are strongly correlated, this Gθ can give nearly optimal mixing speed and make SSHMC much faster. In general, any choice ofGθ andGφ that would be valid for separable HMC with Gibbs is also valid for SSHMC."

We generate 5000 samples from each method after 1000 burn-in iterations. The ESS per second (ESS/s) and mean squared error (MSE) of the sample estimated mean and variance of the hyperparameter are given in Table 1. Notice that RMHMC is much more efficient for the low-level variable because of the adaptive mass matrix with hyperparameter. Figure 1 illustrates a dramatic difference between HMC and SSHMC. It is clear that HMC suffers from oscillation of the hyperparameter in a narrow region. That is because the kinetic energy limits the change of hyperparameters [3, 11]. In contrast, SSHMC has much wider energy variation and the trajectory spans a larger range of hy-\nperparameter v. The energy variation of SSHMC is similar to the RMHMC with Soft-Abs metric (RMHMC-Soft-Abs) reported in [2], an instance of general RMHMC without Gibbs. But compared with [2], each ABLA step is about 100 times faster than each generalized leapfrog step and SSHMC can generate around 2.5 times more effective samples per second than RMHMC-Soft-Abs. Although RHMC within Gibbs has better ESS/s on the low level variables, its estimation of the mean and variance is biased, indicating that the chain has not yet mixed.

It is clear that the samples of RMHMC and SSHMC are consistent, so both methods are mixing well. However, SSHMC generates about six times as many effective samples per hour as RMHMC within Gibbs."

      "text" : "We have presented Semi-Separable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SSHMC), a new version of Riemannian manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (RMHMC) that aims to retain the flexibility of RMHMC for difficult Bayesian sampling problems, while achieving greater simplicity and lower computational complexity. We tested SSHMC on several different hierarchical models, and on all the models we considered, SSHMC outperforms both HMC and RMHMC within Gibbs in terms of number of effective samples produced in a fixed amount of computation time. Future work could consider other choices of mass matrix within the semi-separable framework, or the use of SSHMC within discrete models, following previous work in discrete HMC [12, 15]."
