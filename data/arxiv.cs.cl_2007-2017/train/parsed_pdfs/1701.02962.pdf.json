      "text" : "Antonymy and synonymy represent lexical semantic relations that are central to the organization of the mental lexicon (Miller and Fellbaum, 1991). While antonymy is defined as the oppositeness between words, synonymy refers to words that are similar in meaning (Deese, 1965; Lyons, 1977). From a computational point of view, distinguishing between antonymy and synonymy is important for NLP applications such as Machine Translation and Textual Entailment, which go beyond a general notion of semantic relatedness and require to identify specific semantic relations. However, due to interchangeable substitution, antonyms and synonyms often occur in similar contexts, which makes it challenging to automatically distinguish between them.\nTwo families of approaches to differentiate between antonyms and synonyms are predominent\nin NLP. Both make use of distributional vector representations, relying on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth, 1957), that words with similar distributions have related meanings: co-occurrence models and pattern-based models. These distributional semantic models (DSMs) offer a means to represent meaning vectors of words or word pairs, and to determine their semantic relatedness (Turney and Pantel, 2010).\nIn co-occurrence models, each word is represented by a weighted feature vector, where features typically correspond to words that co-occur in particular contexts. When using word embeddings, these models rely on neural methods to represent words as low-dimensional vectors. To create the word embeddings, the models either make use of neural-based techniques, such as the skipgram model (Mikolov et al., 2013), or use matrix factorization (Pennington et al., 2014) that builds word embeddings by factorizing word-context cooccurrence matrices. In comparison to standard co-occurrence vector representations, word embeddings address the problematic sparsity of word vectors and have achieved impressive results in many NLP tasks such as word similarity (e.g., Pennington et al. (2014)), relation classification (e.g., Vu et al. (2016)), and antonym-synonym distinction (e.g., Nguyen et al. (2016)).\nIn pattern-based models, vector representations make use of lexico-syntactic surface patterns to distinguish between the relations of word pairs. For example, Justeson and Katz (1991) suggested that adjectival opposites co-occur with each other in specific linear sequences, such as between X and Y. Hearst (1992) determined surface patterns, e.g., X such as Y, to identify nominal hypernyms. Lin et al. (2003) proposed two textual patterns indicating semantic incompatibility, from X to Y and either X or Y, to distinguish opposites from semantically similar\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n02 96\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Ja\nn 20\n17\nwords. Roth and Schulte im Walde (2014) proposed a method that combined patterns with discourse markers for classifying paradigmatic relations including antonymy, synonymy, and hypernymy. Recently, Schwartz et al. (2015) used two prominent patterns from Lin et al. (2003) to learn word embeddings that distinguished antonyms from similar words in determining degrees of similarity and word analogy.\nIn this paper, we present a novel patternbased neural method AntSynNET to distinguish antonyms from synonyms. We hypothesize that antonymous word pairs co-occur with each other in lexico-syntactic patterns within a sentence more often than would be expected by synonymous pairs. This hypothesis is inspired by corpus-based studies on antonymy and synonymy. Among others, Charles and Miller (1989) suggested that adjectival opposites co-occur in patterns; Fellbaum (1995) stated that nominal and verbal opposites co-occur in the same sentence significantly more often than chance; Lin et al. (2003) argued that if two words appear in clear antonym patterns, they are unlikely to represent synonymous pair.\nWe start out by inducing patterns between X and Y from a large-scale web corpus, where X and Y represent two words of an antonym or synonym word pair, and the pattern is derived from the simple paths between X and Y in a syntactic parse tree. Each node in the simple path combines lexical and syntactic information; in addition, we suggest a novel feature for the patterns, i.e., the distance between the two words along the syntactic path. All pattern features are fed into a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), which encode the patterns as vector representations. Afterwards, the vector representations of the patterns are used in a classifier to distinguish between antonyms and synonyms. The results from experiments show that AntSynNET improves the performance over prior pattern-based methods. Furthermore, the implementation of our models is made publicly available1.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we present previous work distinguishing antonyms and synonyms. Section 3 describes our proposed AntSynNET model. We present the induction of the patterns (Section 3.1), describe the recurrent neural network with long\n1 https://github.com/nguyenkh/AntSynNET\nshort-term memory units which is used to encode patterns within a vector representation (Section 3.2), and describe two models to classify antonyms and synonyms: the pure pattern-based model (Section 3.3.1) and the combined model (Section 3.3.2). After introducing two baselines in Section 4, we describe our dataset, experimental settings, results of our methods, the effects of the newly proposed distance feature, and the effects of the various types of word embeddings. Section 6 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Pattern-based methods: Regarding the task of antonym-synonym distinction, there exist a variety of approaches which rely on patterns. Lin et al. (2003) used bilingual dependency triples and patterns to extract distributionally similar words. They relied on clear antonym patterns such as from X to Y and either X or Y in a post-processing step to distinguish antonyms from synonyms. The main idea is that if two words X and Y appear in one of these patterns, they are unlikely to represent synonymous pair. Schulte im Walde and Köper (2013) proposed a method to distinguish between the paradigmatic relations antonymy, synonymy and hypernymy in German, based on automatically acquired word patterns. Roth and Schulte im Walde (2014) combined general lexico-syntactic patterns with discourse markers as indicators for the same relations, both for German and for English. They assumed that if two phrases frequently co-occur with a specific discourse marker, then the discourse relation expressed by the corresponding marker should also indicate the relation between the words in the affected phrases. By using the raw corpus and a fixed list of discourse markers, the model can easily be extended to other languages. More recently, Schwartz et al. (2015) presented a symmetric pattern-based model for word vector representation in which antonyms are assigned to dissimilar vector representations. Differently to the previous pattern-based methods which used the standard distribution of patterns, Schwartz et al. used patterns to learn word embeddings.\nVector representation methods: Yih et al. (2012) introduced a new vector representation where antonyms lie on opposite sides of a sphere. They derived this representation with the incorporation of a thesaurus and latent semantic anal-\nysis, by assigning signs to the entries in the cooccurrence matrix on which latent semantic analysis operates, such that synonyms would tend to have positive cosine similarities, and antonyms would tend to have negative cosine similarities. Scheible et al. (2013) showed that the distributional difference between antonyms and synonyms can be identified via a simple word space model by using appropriate features. Instead of taking into account all words in a window of a certain size for feature extraction, the authors experimented with only words of a certain part-of-speech, and restricted distributions. Santus et al. (2014) proposed a different method to distinguish antonyms from synonyms by identifying the most salient dimensions of meaning in vector representations and reporting a new average-precision-based distributional measure and an entropy-based measure. Ono et al. (2015) trained supervised word embeddings for the task of identifying antonymy. They proposed two models to learn word embeddings: the first model relied on thesaurus information; the second model made use of distributional information and thesaurus information. More recently, Nguyen et al. (2016) proposed two methods to distinguish antonyms from synonyms: in the first method, the authors improved the quality of weighted feature vectors by strengthening those features that are most salient in the vectors, and by putting less emphasis on those that are of minor importance when distinguishing degrees of similarity between words. In the second method, the lexical contrast information was integrated into the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013) to learn word embeddings. This model successfully predicted degrees of similarity and identified antonyms and synonyms."

      "text" : "Corpus-based studies on antonymy have suggested that opposites co-occur with each other within a sentence significantly more often than would be expected by chance. Our method thus makes use of patterns as the main indicators of word pair co-occurrence, to enforce a distinction between antonyms and synonyms. Figure 1 shows a syntactic parse tree of the sentence “My old village has been provided with the new services”. Following the characterizations of a tree in graph theory, any two nodes (vertices) of a tree are connected by a simple path (or one unique path). The simple path is the shortest path between any two nodes in a tree and does not contain repeated nodes. In the example, the lexico-syntactic tree pattern of the antonymous pair old–new is determined by finding the simple path (in red) from the lemma old to the lemma new. It focuses on the most relevant information and ignores irrelevant information which does not appear in the simple path (i.e., has, been). The example pattern between X = old and Y = new in Figure 1 is represented as follows: X/JJ/amod/2 -- village/NN/nsubj/1 -- provide/VBN/ROOT/0\n-- with/IN/prep/1 -- service/NNS/pobj/2\n-- Y/JJ/amod/3.\nNode Representation: The path patterns make use of four features to represent each node in the syntax tree: lemma, part-of-speech (POS) tag, dependency label and distance label. The lemma feature captures the lexical information of words in the sentence, while the POS and dependency features capture the morpho-syntactic information of the sentence. The distance label measures the path distance between the target word nodes in the syntactic tree. Each step between a parent and a child node represents a distance of 1; and the ancestor nodes of the remaining nodes in the path are represented by a distance of 0. For example, the node provided is an ancestor node of the simple path from old to new. The distances from the node provided to the nodes village and old are 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe vector representation of each node concatenates the four-feature vectors as follows:\n~vnode = [~vlemma ⊕ ~vpos ⊕ ~vdep ⊕ ~vdist]\nwhere ~vlemma, ~vpos, ~vdep, ~vdist represent the embeddings of the lemma, POS tag, dependency label\nand distance label, respectively; and the⊕ denotes the concatenation operation.\nPattern Representation: For a pattern p which is constructed by the sequence of nodes n1, n2, ..., nk, the pattern representation of p is a sequence of vectors: p = [~n1, ~n2, ..., ~nk]. The pattern vector ~vp is then encoded by applying a recurrent neural network."

      "heading" : "3.2 Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory Units",
      "text" : "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is suitable for modeling sequential data by a vector representation. In our methods, we use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, a variant of a recurrent neural network to encode patterns, for the following reasons. Given a sequence of words p = [n1, n2, ..., nk] as input data, an RNN processes each word nt at a time, and returns a vector of state hk for the complete input sequence. For each time step t, the RNN updates an internal memory state ht which depends on the current input nt and the previous state ht−1. Yet, if the sequential input is a long-term dependency, an RNN faces the problem of gradient vanishing or exploding, leading to difficulties in training the model.\nLSTM units address these problems. The underlying idea of an LSTM is to use an adaptive gating mechanism to decide on the degree that LSTM units keep the previous state and memorize the extracted features of the current input. More specif-\nically, an LSTM comprises four components: an input gate it, a forget gate ft, an output gate ot, and a memory cell ct. The state of an LSTM at each time step t is formalized as follows:\nit = σ(Wi · xt + Ui · ht−1 + bi) ft = σ(Wf · xt + Uf · ht−1 + bf ) ot = σ(Wo · xt + Uo · ht−1 + bo) gt = tanh(Wc · xt + Uc · ht−1 + bc) ct = it ⊗ gt + ft ⊗ ct−1\nW refers to a matrix of weights that projects information between two layers; b is a layer-specific vector of bias terms; σ denotes the sigmoid function. The output of an LSTM at a time step t is computed as follows:\nht = ot ⊗ tanh(ct)\nwhere ⊗ denotes element-wise multiplication. In our methods, we rely on the last state hk to represent the vector ~vp of a pattern p = [~n1, ~n2, ..., ~nk]."

For example, contrast relations might indicate antonymy, whereas elaborations may indicate synonymy or hyponymy.\nMichael Roth, the first author of R&SiW, kindly computed the relation classification results of the pattern–discourse model for our test sets.

The patterns were filtered based on their frequencies, such that the resulting pattern set contained 11 patterns. For generating word embeddings, a matrix of co-occurrence counts between patterns and words in the vocabulary was computed, using positive point-wise mutual information. The sparsity problem of vector representations was addressed by smoothing. For antonym representation, the authors relied on two patterns suggested by Lin et al.

This strengthens our hypothesis that there is a higher possibility for the co-occurrence of antonymous pairs in patterns over synonymous pairs within a sentence. Because, when the proposed models obtain high recall scores, the models are able to retrieve most relevant information (antonymous pairs) corresponding to the patterns. Regarding the low precision in the two proposed models, we sampled randomly 5 pairs in each population: true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative. We then compared the overlap of patterns for the true predictions (true positive pairs and true negative pairs) and the false predictions (false positive pairs and false negative pairs). We found out that there is no overlap between patterns of true predictions; and the number overlap between patterns of false predictions is 2, 2, and 4 patterns for noun, adjective, and verb classes, respectively. This shows that the low precision of our models stems from the patterns which represent both antonymous and synonymous pairs."

Hence, we use the distance feature to effectively capture these relationships.\nIn order to evaluate the effect of our novel distance feature, we compare the distance feature to the direction feature proposed by Shwartz et al.

The direction feature represented the direction of the dependency label between two nodes in a path from X to Y.\nFor evaluation, we make use of the same information regarding dataset and patterns as in Section 5.3, and then replace the distance feature by the direction feature.
