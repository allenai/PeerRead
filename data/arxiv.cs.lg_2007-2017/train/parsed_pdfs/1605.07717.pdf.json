      "text" : "Anomaly detection (also called novelty or outlier detection) is to identify patterns that do not conform to the expected normal patterns (Chandola et al., 2009). Existing methods for outlier detection either construct a profile for normal data examples and then identify the examples not conform-\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016.

A variety of methods can be found in the survey (Zimek et al., 2012). Anomaly detection is to correctly characterize data distribution in nature, so the normality of the data characteristic can be characterized as a distribution and any future data can be benchmarked against the normality. Apparently, the statistical power and accuracy of the anomaly detection methods depend on the capacity of the model that is used to characterize the data distribution.\nOur work is inspired by the extraordinary capacity of deep models which are able to capture the complex distributions in real-world applications. Recent empirical and theoretical studies indicate that deep architectures are able to achieve better generalization ability compared to the shallow counterparts on challenging recognition tasks (Bengio, 2009). The key ingredient to the success of deep learning is its ability to learn multiple levels of representations with increasing abstraction. For example, it is shown that properly regularized autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2010; Rifai et al., 2011) are able to effectively characterize the data distribution and learn useful representations, which are not achieved by shallow methods such as PCA or K-Means.\nHowever, deep models have not been systematically studied and developed for anomaly detection. Central questions critical to this development include: 1) how to effectively model the data generating distribution with a deep model? 2) how to generalize a model to a range of data structures such as static data, sequential data, and spatial data? 3) how to develop computationally efficient training algorithms to make them scalable? and 4) how to derive statistically sound decision criteria for anomaly detection purpose?\nTo answer these questions in a systematic manner, in this work, we propose deep structured energy based models (DSEBMs). Our approach falls into the category of en-\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n07 71\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n5 M\nergy based models (EMBs) (LeCun et al., 2006), which is a powerful tool for density estimation. An EBM works by coming up with a specific parameterization of the negative log probability, which is called energy, and then computing the density with a proper normalization. In this work, we focus on deep energy based models (Ngiam et al., 2011), where the energy function is composed of a deep neural network. Moreover, we investigate various model architectures as to accommodate different data structures. For example, for data with static vector inputs, standard feed forward neural networks can be applied. However, for sequential data, such as audio sequence, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to be better choices. Likewise, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are significantly more efficient at modeling spatial structures (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), such as on images. Our model thus allows the energy function to be composed of deep neural networks with designated structures (fully connected, recurrent or convolutional), significantly extending the application of EBMs to a wide spectrum of data structures.\nDespite its powerful expressive ability, the training of EBMs remains fairly complicated compared to the training of a deterministic deep neural network, as the former requires carefully designed sampling algorithm to deal with its intrinsic intractability. The need of efficient training algorithms is even more severe with DSEBMs, given its complicated structured parameterization. To this end, we adopt the score matching method (Hyvärinen, 2005) as the training algorithm, instead of the default maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Similarly to (Vincent, 2011), we are able to train a DSEBM in the same way as that of a deep denoising autoencoder (DAE) Vincent et al. (2010), which only requires standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This significantly simplifies the training procedure and allows us to efficiently train a DSEBM on large datasets.\nIn order to perform the actual anomaly detection with a trained DSEBM, we investigate two decision criteria, the energy score and the reconstruction error. We show that the two criteria are closely connected from the view of the energy landscape, and evaluate their effectiveness under different scenarios. We perform extensive evaluations on several benchmarks varying from static, sequential to spatial data. We show that our method consistently matches or outperforms the competing algorithms."

An EBM parameter-\nizes a density function for input x ∈ Rd in the form:\np(x; θ) = e−E(x;θ)\nZ(θ) , (1)\nwhere E(x; θ) is the energy (negative log probability) associated with instance x; Z(θ) = ∫ x e−E(x;θ)dx is the partition function to ensure that the density function integrates to probability 1; θ are the model parameters to be learned. The nice property of EBM is that one is free to parameterize the energy in any sensible way, giving it much flexibility and expressive power. Learning is conducted by assigning lower energy (hence higher probability) to observed instances and vice versa. However, directly applying MLE is impossible due to the intractability of the partition fuction Z(θ), and thus one usually needs to resort to MCMC methods and approximate the integration with the summation over samples from a Markov chain."

Multiple RBMs can be trained and stacked on top of each other to formulate a deep RBM, which makes it useful for initializing multi-layer neural networks.

      "heading" : "2.3. Denoising Autoencoders and Score Matching",
      "text" : "Autoencoders are unsupervised models that learn to reconstruct the input. A typical form of autoencoder minimizes the following objective function:\nN∑ i=1 ‖xi − f(xi; θ)‖22 (3)\nwhere f(·; θ) is the reconstruction function that maps Rd → Rd which is usually composed of an encoder followed by a decoder with symmetrical architecture and shared parameters. One particularly interesting variant of autoencoders is DAEs (Vincent et al., 2010), which learn to construct the inputs given their randomly corrupted versions:\nN∑ i=1 E ‖xi − f(xi + ; θ)‖22, (4)\nwhere ∼ N (0, σ2I) is an isotropic Gaussian noise. DAEs are easy to train with standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and perform significantly better than unregularized autoencoders.\nWhile RBM and DAEs are typically considered as two alternative unsupervised deep models, it is recently shown they are closely related to each other. In particular, (Vincent, 2011) shows that training an RBM with score matching (SM) (Hyvärinen, 2005) is equivalent to a one-layer DAE. SM is an alternative method to MLE, which is especially suitable for estimating non-normalized density functions such as EBM. Instead of trying to directly maximize the probability of training instances, SM minimizes the following objective function:\nJ(θ) = 1\n2 ∫ x px(x)‖ψ(x; θ)− ψx(x)‖22dx, (5)\nwhere px(x) is the true data distribution which is unknown; ψ(x; θ) = ∇x log p(x; θ) = −∇xE(x; θ) and ψx(x; θ) = ∇x log px(x) are the score function of the model and the true density function, respectively. In words, J(θ) measures the expected distance of the scores between the model density and the true density. (Vincent, 2011) shows that by approximating the px(x) with the Parzen window density 1 N ∑N i=1N (xi, σ2I), minimizing Equation 5 yields an objective function in the same form as that of an autoencoder in Equation 4, with a reconstruction function defined as:\nf(x; θ) = x−∇xE(x; θ). (6)\nSubstituting E(x; θ) with Equation 2 yields a typical onelayer DAE (up to a constant factor):\nf(x; θ) =Wσ(WTx+ b) + b′, (7)\nwhere σ(x) is the sigmoid function 11+e−x .\nEquation 6 plays a key role in this work, as it allows one to efficiently train an arbitrary EBM in a similar way to that of a DAE, as long as the energy function is differentiable w.r.t. x and θ. As will be demonstrated below, this makes training a deep EBM with various underlying structures in an end-to-end fashion, without the need of resorting to sophisticated sampling procedures (Ngiam et al., 2011) or layer wise pretraining (Hinton, 2010)."

On the other hand, it is often necessary to adapt the architecture of a deep model to the structure of data. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been shown to work very well at modeling sequential data;\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are very effective at modeling data with spatial structure. In this work, we extend EBMs further to deep structured EBMs (DSEBMs), where we allow the underlying deep neural network encoding the energy function to take architectures varying from fully connected, recurrent, and convolutional. This generalizes EBMs (LeCun et al., 2006) as well as deep EBMs (Ngiam et al., 2011) as it makes our model applicable to a much wider spectrum of applications, including static data, sequential data and spatial data. Moreover, we show that by deriving the proper reconstruction functions with Equation 6, DSEBMs can be easily trained with SGD, regardless of the type of the underlying architecture. In the following, we will elaborate the formulation of DSEBMs for the three cases."

The 0th layer is defined as the input itself; and thus we have K0 = d, h0 = x. We have explicitly included the term ‖x − b′‖22 which acts as a prior, punishing the probability of the inputs that are far away from b′ ∈ Rd.\nFollowing the chain rule of gradient computation, one can derive the reconstruction function as follows:\nf(x; θ) = x−∇xE(x; θ) = h′0 + b′\nh′l−1 = ∂hl ∂hl−1 h′l = σ(W T l hl−1 + bl) · (Wlh′l), for l ∈ [1, L− 1],\n(9)\nwhere h′L = 1 with 1 ∈ RKL denoting a column vector of all ones; · is the element-wise product between vectors. One can then plug in the resulting f(x; θ) into Equation 4 and train it as a regular L-layer DAE."

      "heading" : "3.2. Recurrent EBMs",
      "text" : "Our formulation of recurrent EBMs is similar to (Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2012), where an EBM is built at each time step, with parameters determined by an underlying RNN. Formally, given a sequence of length T x = [x1, ..., xT ], xt ∈ Rd, we factorize the joint probability as p(x) = ∏T t=1 p(x t|x1,...,t−1) with the chain rule of\nprobability. For each time step t, p(xt|x1,...,t−1) is modeled as an EBM with energy E(xt|θt). In contrast to the conventional formulation of EBM, the parameters of the EMB θt is a function of the inputs from all the previous time steps x1,...,t−1. A natural choice of θt is to let it be the output of an RNN. As a concrete example, consider the energy function at each step follows that in Equation 2, by replacingW, b, b′ withW t, bt, b′t. Directly letting the RNN to update all the parameters at each step requires a large RNN with lots of parameters. As a remedy, (BoulangerLewandowski et al., 2012) proposes to fix W t = W for all time steps, only letting bt and b′t to be updated by the RNN:\nht = g(Whhh t−1 +Whxx t + bh) bt =Wbhh t + b, b′t =Wb′hh t + b′, (10)\nwhere Whh ∈ RKrnn×Krnn ,Whx ∈ RKrnn×d, bh ∈ RKrnn are parameters of the RNN; Wbh ∈ RKebm×Krnn , b ∈ RKebm ,Wb′h ∈ Rd×Krnn , b′ ∈ Rd are the weights with which to transform the hidden state of the RNN to the adaptive biases.\nTraining the recurrent EBM with score matching is similar to that of a fully connected EBM. To see this, we now have p(x) = e − ∑T t=1 E(x\nt;θt)∏T t=1 Z t , where Zt = ∑ x e −E(x;θt)\nis the partition function for the tth step. Plugging p(x) into Equation 5, we have ψ(x) = ∇x log p(x) ≈ −[∇Tx1E(x1; θ1), ...,∇TxTE(x\nT ; θT )]T . In the last step, we have made a simplification by omitting the gradient term of ∇xjE(xi; θi), for j < i 1. Accordingly, Equation 6 is modified to f(x) = x − [∇Tx1E(x1; θ1), ...,∇TxTE(x\nT ; θT )]T . One is then able to train the recurrent EBM by plugging f(x) into Equation 4 and perform the standard SGD. Note that in this case the standard backpropagation is replaced with backpropagation through time, due to the need of updating the RNN parameters."

      "text" : "Previously, the combination of CNN and RBM have been proposed in (Lee et al., 2009), where several layers of RBMs are alternately convolved with an image then stacked on top of each other. In this paper, we take a significantly different approach by directly building deep EBMs with convolution operators (with optional pooling layers or fully connected layers), simply by replacing hL in Equation 8 with the output of a CNN. Using a deterministic deep convolutional EBM allows one to directly train the model end-to-end with score matching, thus significantly simplifies the training procedure compared with (Lee et al., 2009). Formally, consider the input of the (l − 1)th layer\n1While one can also choose to use the full gradient, we find this simplification works well in practice, yielding an objective in a much more succinct form.\nhl−1 ∈ RKl−1×dl−1×dl−1 is a dl−1×dl−1 image withKl−1 channels. We define hl as the output of a convolution layer:\nhl,j = g( Kl−1∑ k=1 W̃l,j,k ∗ hl−1,k + bl,j), j ∈ [1,Kl]. (11)\nHere W ∈ RKl×Kl−1×dw,l×dw,l are the Kl convolutional filters of size dw,l × dw,l; bl ∈ RKl is the bias for each filter. We denote the tilde operator (Ã) as flipping a matrix A horizontally and vertically; ∗ is the ”valid” convolution operator, where convolution is only conducted where the input and the filter fully overlap. dl = dl−1 − dw,l + 1 is thus the size of the output image following the valid convolution. In order to compute the reconstruction function following equation 9, we modify the recurrence equation from h′l to h ′ l−1 for a convolutional operator as:\nh′l−1,k = Kl∑ j=1 [σ( Kl−1∑ k=1 W̃l,j,k∗hl−1,k+bl,j)·(Wl,j,k h′l,j)]. (12) Here we have denoted as the ”full” convolution operator, where convolution is conducted whenever the input and the filter overlap by at least one position. Besides the convolution layer, we can also use a max pooling layer which typically follows a convolution layer. Denote dp × dp as the pooling window size, passing hl−1 through a max pooling layer gives an output as:\nhl,k,p,q, xl,k,p,q, yl,k,p,q\n= max (p−1)dp+1≤i≤pdp,(q−1)dp+1≤j≤qdp\nhl−1,k,i,j . (13)\nHere the max operation returns the maximum value as the first term and the corresponding maximum coordinates as the second and third. Rewriting the recurrence equation corresponding to Equation 8 yields:\nh′l−1,k,xl,k,p,q,yl,k,p,q = h ′ l,k,p,q, p, q ∈ [1, dl], (14)\nwhere the unassigned entries of h′l−1 are all set as zero.\nThe derivation above shows that one is able to compute the reconstruction function f(x) for a deep convolutional EBM consisting of convolution, max pooling and fully connected layers. Other types of layers such as mean pooling can also be managed in a similar way, which is omitted due to the space limit."

      "heading" : "4. Deep Structured EBMs for Anomaly Detection",
      "text" : "Performing anomaly detection given a trained EBM naturally corresponds to identifying data points that are assigned low probability by the model. With a trained DSEBM, we can then select samples that are assigned\nprobability lower than some pre-chosen threshold pth as outliers. Although computing the exact probability according to Equation 1 is intractable, one can immediately recognize the following logic:\np(x; θ) < pth ⇒ log p(x; θ) < log pth ⇒ E(x; θ) > log pth + logZ(θ)⇒ E(x; θ) > Eth. (15)\nHere we have used the fact that Z(θ) is a constant that does not depend on x; hence selecting samples with probability lower than pth is equivalent to selecting those with energy higher than a corresponding energy threshold Eth. 2\nMoreover, motivated by the connection of EBMs and DAEs, we further investigate another decision criteria which is based on the reconstruction error. In the early work of (Williams et al., 2002), autoencoders (which they call replicator neural networks) have been applied to anomaly detection. However, their adoption autoencoders are unregularized, and thus could not be interpreted as a density model. The authors then propose to use the reconstruction error as the decision criterion, selecting those with high reconstruction error as outliers. On the other hand, with a DSEBM trained with score matching, we are able to derive the corresponding reconstruction error as ‖x − f(x; θ)‖22 = ‖∇xE(x; θ)‖22. The corresponding decision rule is thus ‖∇xE(x; θ)‖22 > Errorth, with some threshold Errorth. 3 In other words, examples with high reconstruction errors correspond to examples whose energy has large gradient norms. This view makes reconstruction error a sensible criterion as on the energy surface inliers usually sit close to local minimums, where the gradient should be close to zero. However, using the reconstruction error might produce false positive examples (outliers that are classified as inliers), as if a sample sits close to a local maximum on the energy surface, the gradient of its energy will also be small. We demonstrate the two criteria in Figure 4 with a 1D example. As we see, for x1 and x3, both energy and reconstruction error produces the correct prediction. However, x2 is a false positive example under the reconstruction error criterion, which energy correctly recognizes as an outlier. However, note that in a high dimensional input space, the probability that an outlier resides around a local maximum grows exponentially small w.r.t. the dimensionality. As a result, the reconstruction error still serves as a reasonable criterion."

Graham et al. proposed a method based on autoencoder (Williams et al., 2002). However, all the methods above are static in nature which does not assume the structure of data. Two types of data are extensively studied in sequential anomaly detection: sequential time series data and event data. Sun et al. proposes a technique that uses Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PST) to find the nearest neighbors for a given sequence to detect sequential anomalies in protein sequences (Sun et al., 2006). Song et al. presents a one class conditional random fields method for general sequential anomaly detection tasks (Song et al., 2013).

Despite the usage similar use of CNNs, our work takes a very different path by directly modeling the density. Methodology-wise, there is also a recent surge of training EBMs with score matching (Vincent, 2011; Swersky et al., 2011; Kingma & Cun, 2010).

We propose deep structured energy based models (DSEBMs), where the energy function is the output of a deterministic deep neural network with structure. We develop novel model architectures to integrate EBMs with different types of data such as static data, sequential data, and spatial data, and apply appropriate model architectures to adapt to the data structure. Our training algorithm is built upon the recent development of score matching (Hyvärinen, 2005), which connects an EBM with a regularized autoencoder, eliminating the need for complicated sampling method. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived for anomaly detection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the data distribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomaly detection: the energy score and the reconstruction error. Extensive empirical studies on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed model consistently matches or outperforms all the competing methods.",
