      "text" : "Deep Residual Networks have reached the state of the art in many image processing tasks such image classification. However, the cost for a gain in accuracy in terms of depth and memory is prohibitive as it requires a higher number of residual blocks, up to double the initial value. To tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a way to reduce the redundant information of the networks. We share the weights of convolutional layers between residual blocks operating at the same spatial scale. The signal flows multiple times in the same convolutional layer. The resulting architecture, called ShaResNet, containsblockspecific layersandshared layers. These ShaResNet are trained exactly in the same fashion as the commonly used residual networks. We show, on the one hand, that they are almost as efficient as their sequential counterparts while involving less parameters, and on the other hand that they are more efficient than a residual network with the same number of parameters. For example, a 152-layer-deep residual network can be reduced to 106 convolutional layers, i.e. a parameter gain of 39%, while loosing less than 0.2% accuracy on ImageNet."

      "text" : "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are now widely used for image processing tasks from clas-\nsification [LBBH98] and object detection [GDDM14, RHGS15] to semantic segmentation [BKC15, ASL16]. Their utilisation even generalizes to other fields where data can be represented as tensors like in point cloud processing [BM16] or 3D shape style identification [LGK16]. Today's network architectures still carry a strong inheritanceof theCNNearly stage designs. They are based on stacking convolutional, activation and dimensionality reduction layers. Over the past years, the progress in image processing tasks went together with a gradual increase in the number of layers, from AlexNet [KSH12] to Residual networks [HZRS16] (ResNets) that may contain up to hundreds of convolutions.\nPractical use of such networks may be challenging when using low memory system, such as autonomous vehicles, both for optimization and inference. Moreoever, from a biological point of view, a higher number of stacked layers leads to networks further from the original underlying idea of neural networks: biological brain mimicry. According to the current knowledge of the brain, cerebral cortex is composed of a low number of layers where the neurons are highly connected. Moreover the signal is also allowed to recursively go through the same neurons. In that sense recurrentneuralnetworksare much closer to the brain structure butmore difficult to optimize [BSF94, HS97].\nLooking more closely at the repetition of residual blocks in ResNets, it could somehow be interpreted as an unwrapped recurrent neural networks. This constatation raises questions such as \"how similar are the weights of the blocks ?\", \"do the same parts of the blocks operate similar operations ?\" and in the later case \"is it possible to reduce the parameter number of a residual network ?\".

It results in a great decrease of the number of network parameters, from 25% to 45% depending on the size of the original architecture. Our networks also present a better ratio performances over parameter number while downgrading the absolute performance by less than 1%.\nThe paper is organized as follow: section 2 presents the related work on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) ; the ShaResNets are presented in section 3 and finally, in section 4, we expose our experimentations on classification datasets CIFAR 10 and 100 and ILSVRC Imagenet."

      "text" : "CNNswere introduced in [LBD+89] for handwritten digits recognition. They became over the past years one of the most enthusiastic field of deep learning [LBH15]. TheCNNsareusuallybuilt usinga common framework. They containsmany convolutional layers and operate a gradual spatial dimension reduction using convolutional strides or pooling layers [CMS12, JKL+09]. This structure naturally integrates low/mid/high level features along with a dimension compression before ending with a classifier, commonly a perceptron [Ros57], multi-layered or not, i.e. one ormore fully connected layers.\nLooking at the evolution CNNs, the depth appears to be a key feature. On challenging image processing tasks, an increase of performance is often related to a deeper network. As an example, AlexNet [KSH12] has 5 convolutions while VGG16 and VGG19 [SZ14] have respectively 16 and 19 convolutional layers andmore recently, in [HSL+16], the authors train a 1200 layer deep network.\nVariations in the LeNet structure have also been used to improve convergence. In a Network in Network (NiN) [LCY14], convolutionsaremappedwitha multilayerperceptron (1x1 convolutions),whichprevent overfitting and improved accuracy on datasets such as CIFAR [KH09]. GoogLeNet [SLJ+15] introduced a multiscale approach using the inception module, composedofparallel convolutionswithdif-\nferent kernel sizes.\nOptimizingsuchdeeparchitectures can facepractical problems such as overfitting or vanishing or explodinggradients. Toovercomethese issues, several solutions havebeenproposed such as enhance optimizers [SMDH13],dropout [SHK+14]applyingarandom reduction of the number of connection in fully connected layers or on convolutional layers [ZK16], intelligent initialization strategies [GB10] or training sub-networks with stochastic depth [HSL+16].\nResidual networks [HZRS16] achieved the state of the art in many recognition tasks including Imagenet [RDS+15] and COCO [LMB+14]. They proved to be easier to optimize. One of the particularities of these networks is to be very deep, up to hundreds of residual layers. More recently, the authors of [ZK16] introduced wide residual networks which reduce the depth compared to usual resnets by usingwider convolutional blocks.\nReducing network size has been the object of several works. More compact layers are also used, like the replacement of the fully connected layers by average pooling [SLJ+15, HZRS16]. In [RORF16, CB16], theweights are constrained be binary, reducing considerably thememory consumption. [Pra89] prune weights in pretrained networks, modfiying the structure, to create a lighter network. [HMD15] remove redundant connections and allow weight sharing. Similarly, in this work, we use weight sharing to reduce the network size, except that we enforceapredefinedsharingstructureat trainingtime. We do not need post processing of the network."

      "heading" : "3.2 Sharing weights",
      "text" : "The underlying idea of our approach is that it is possible to somehow distinguish two types of mechanisms in a residual block. The first, specific to the block, is the abstraction of the residual block. From block to block, it created higher level features. The second, redundant in theblocksof thesamestage, is the spatial connection relations between neighboring tensor cells, between pixels. The equation 1 becomes:\nxs,k+1 = xs,k + F(xs,k,Ws,k,Ws) (2)\nwhere xs,k (resp. xs,k+1) is the input (resp. the output) of block (k, s),k-th residual unit of stage s.Wk of equation 1 is split intoWk,s, the parameters specific to the residual block and Ws the parameters shared at the stage level.\nIn ResNets, the spatial information is taken into account in the 3x3 convolutions and in the layers with dimension reduction (convolution with stride or pooling layers). We first look at the bottleneck block, composedof 3 convolutions (1x1, 3x3 and 1x1). The fictive separation between spatial connection andspecific operations is easyas the 1x1 convolution do not connect neighboring cells. This is the top line of figure 3(a). Then, for all spatial connections in the same stage, i.e. for all the blocks between two pooling layers (or convolution with stride), we share the weights. By using a unique 3x3 convolution, we consider that all the spatial connections of a given stage can be explained by a common set of kernels (figure 3(b)).\nWe adapt the approach to the basic residual block. As it is composed of two 3x3 convolutions, extracting the spatial component is not possible. Still, we adopt a similar approach, the first convolution is considered as specific and the second is sharedwith the blocks of the same stage (figure 3, bottom line).\nIn the two cases, we obtain a similar global architecture represented in figure 1. For each stage, the green convolution is common to all block while the specific items are blue (the number of specific items depends on the architecture choice). The red blocks are the dimensionality reduction layers and the yellow onewould be either amulti-layer perceptron or an average pooling."

The gapbetweenoriginal and shared version is lower on ImageNet and CIFAR 100. This is to be related to the sizes of the networks. The CIFAR 10 networks are smaller than\nthe others (less than 10M parameters). To our understanding, smaller residual networks induces less redundancy, so that reducing the number of parameters only reduce the learning capacity. On the contrary, large networks such as wide residual network with large widening factor or residual networks for ImageNet are more subject to redundant parameters. In that case, sharing weights makes more sense, like for CIFAR 100 where the accuracy gap is only of 0.2%with parameters reduced by 26%.\nCompared to sequential networks, sharing spatial connections at stage level induces a loss of accuracy at test time. We now compare our ShaResNets to less deep networks with a similar number of parameters. Table 3 shows these results for CIFAR. For each shared architecture, we compare its sequential counterpart with reduced depth. We can draw similar conclusion as in the first paragraph. Sharing weights on relatively small architectures (CIFAR 10) is notmore efficient thanusing a less deepnetwork. On the contrary,Wide ResNetwith awiden factor of 10 (CIFAR 100) gets a boost in accuracy using shared convolutions. Deeper networks benefit frommutualisation of spatial relations, the weights are better used, i.e. the ratio accuracy over network size gets better.\nOn Imagenet, table 2 underlines that the sharing is more efficient as the network goes larger. We even reach similar accuracy (less than 0.2% drop) for the 152 layer architecture. The figure 5 presents the top-1 error function of the weight on ImageNet. The shared architectures plot (green curve) is situated under the blue curve (residual networks).

By sharing convolutions between residual blocks, we create neural architectures lighter than their sequential residual counterpart by 25% to 45% in terms of number of parameters. The training of such network is as easy as with common residual networks. We experimented on three classification datasets. Shared residual architecture proved to be efficient for large networks. We observed an accuracy gap to the corresponding residual architecture of less than 1% for a substantial size reduction. By exploiting the redundant relations of 3x3 convolutions between residual blocks, the ShaResNets make better use of the optimizable weights. With an equivalent parameter number, we obtain better results. We hope that these findings\nwill help further investigation in image processing andmore generally in deep learning research.\nImplementation and hardware details\nThe experiments uses Torch7 with neural network package. Our code for CIFAR 10 and 100 experiments is based on the original implementation of Wide Residual Networks (github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residualnetworks). Similarly for Imagenet, we used the code from github.com/facebook/fb.resnet.torch.\nExperiments were operated using Titan X (Maxwell) GPUs, one for CIFAR and two for ImageNet.\nCode\nThe code is available online at github.com/ aboulch/sharesnet."

    "abstractText" : "Deep Residual Networks have reached the state of the art in many image processing tasks such image classification. However, the cost for a gain in accuracy in terms of depth and memory is prohibitive as it requires a higher number of residual blocks, up to double the initial value. To tackle this problem, we propose in this paper a way to reduce the redundant information of the networks. We share the weights of convolutional layers between residual blocks operating at the same spatial scale. The signal flows multiple times in the same convolutional layer. The resulting architecture, called ShaResNet, containsblockspecific layersandshared layers. These ShaResNet are trained exactly in the same fashion as the commonly used residual networks. We show, on the one hand, that they are almost as efficient as their sequential counterparts while involving less parameters, and on the other hand that they are more efficient than a residual network with the same number of parameters. For example, a 152-layer-deep residual network can be reduced to 106 convolutional layers, i.e. a parameter gain of 39%, while loosing less than 0.2% accuracy on ImageNet.",
