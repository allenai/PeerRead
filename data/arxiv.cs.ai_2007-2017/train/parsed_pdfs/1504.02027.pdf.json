These five features are supplemented until a seven partition of unity by adding two features of neutrosophic certainty such as truth and falsity.\nThe paper also presents the particular forms of neutroso-\nphic entropy obtained in the case of bifuzzy representations, intuitionistic fuzzy representations, paraconsistent fuzzy representations and finally the case of fuzzy representations.\nKeywords: Neutrosophic information, neutrosophic entropy, neutrosophic uncertainty, ambiguity, contradiction, neutrality, igno-\nrance, saturation."

      "text" : "Neutrosophic representation of information was proposed by Smarandache [10], [11], [12] as an extension of fuzzy representation proposed by Zadeh [16] and intuitionistic fuzzy representation proposed by Atanassov [1], [2]. Primary neutrosophic information is defined by three parameters: degree of truth  , degree of falsity  and degree of\nneutrality  . Fuzzy representation is described by a single parameter, degree of truth  , while the degree of falsity  has a de-\nfault value calculated by negation formula :\n 1 (1.1)\nand the degree of neutrality has a default value that is 0 . Fuzzy intuitionistic representation is described by two explicit parameters, degree of truth  and degree of falsity\n , while the degree of neutrality has a default value that is 0 . Atanassov considered the incomplete variant taking into account that 1 . This allowed defining the index of\nignorance (incompleteness) with the formula:\n 1 (1.2)\nthus obtaining a consistent representation of information, because the sum of the three parameters is 1 , namely:\n1  (1.3)\nHence, we get for neutrality the value 0 .\nFor paraconsistent fuzzy information where 1 , the\nindex of contradiction can be defined:\n1  (1.4)\nand for neutrality it results: 0 .\nFor bifuzzy information that is defined by the pair ),(  ,\nthe net truth, the index of ignorance (incompleteness), index of contradiction and index of ambiguity can be defined, by:\n  (1.5)\n)1,min(1   (1.6)\n1)1,max(   (1.7)\n|1|||1   (1.8)\nAmong of these information parameters the most important is the construction of some measures for information entropy or information uncertainty. This paper is dedicated to the construction of neutrosophic entropy formulae.\nIn the next, section 2 presents the construction of two\nvariants of the neutrosophic entropy. This construction is based on two similarity formulae; Section 3 presents a penta-valued representation of neutrosophic entropy based\nVasile Pătraşcu, The Neutrosophic Entropy and its Five Components\non ambiguity, ignorance, contradiction, neutrality and saturation; Section 4 outlines some conclusions."

    "abstractText" : "This paper presents two variants of pentavalued representation for neutrosophic entropy. The first is an extension of Kaufmann's formula and the second is an extension of Kosko's formula. Based on the primary three-valued information represented by the degree of truth, degree of falsity and degree of neutrality there are built some penta-valued representations that better highlights some specific features of neutrosophic entropy. Thus, we highlight five features of neutrosophic uncertainty such as ambiguity, ignorance, contradiction, neutrality and saturation. These five features are supplemented until a seven partition of unity by adding two features of neutrosophic certainty such as truth and falsity. The paper also presents the particular forms of neutrosophic entropy obtained in the case of bifuzzy representations, intuitionistic fuzzy representations, paraconsistent fuzzy representations and finally the case of fuzzy representations.",
