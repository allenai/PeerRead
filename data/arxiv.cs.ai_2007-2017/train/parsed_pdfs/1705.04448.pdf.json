      "text" : "Index Terms—Deep Learning, Android Malware Detection, Convolutional Neural Network\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSmartphones have gained widespread popularing worldwide, among them. Android is the most commonly used operating system (OS), and is still expanding as ferritory. International Data Corporation (IDC) 2016 Q3 smartphones OS marketshare reports 86.8% of smartphones are Android phones, indicating a steady growth market share, compared to 84.3% of marketshare in 2015 Q2 (see Fig. 1) [1]. Android is featured by its openness; users can choose to downloads apps from Google Play and third-party marketplace. However due to the popularing and openness, Android has attracted the attacker’s attention. In purticalar malicious software (malware) can easily spread and infect benign devises. Security Report 201516 of AV-TEST Intitute reports that while the number of malware is increased from 17 millions in 2005 to over 600 millions in 2016, the percentage of Android malware has a significant increase from 3.19% in 2015 to 7.48% in 2016Q2. Among them, Trojans targeting at stealing user data occupy 97.49%. We can also find that Android malware has dominat-\ning percetange, 99.87% on the number of malware on mobile platform [2]. Fig. 2 shows the statistic collected from our backend system during January 2017., where for countries such as US, UK, France, etc., more than 50000 users are infected everyday. Moreover, from our experience, the number of Android malware is sharply increased from 1000000 in 2012 to 2.8 million in 2014. Due to the serious security problem caused by Android malware, we propose, color-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based Android malware detection, R2D2, to detect Android malware. Different from the existing solution, our propose R2-D2 detection is featured by its endto-end learning process. More specifically, in contrast to the prior solutions that require manual process of feature selection and parameter configuration, our proposed R2-D2 detection takes as input the training samples and outputs the malware detection model without the human interrelation.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n04 44\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C R\n] 1\n2 M\nay 2\n01 7"

      "text" : "Android Package (APK) is the paella format used by Android OS for distribution and installation of mobile apps. Essentially, APK fields are a type of zip-formatted archive file. The structure of APK can be dissected as follows:\n• META-INIF/: contains the information description from Java jar file. • res/: contains the resource document. • libs/: contains the so library from Android Native Devel-\nopment (NDK) • AndroidManifest.xml: contains the configuration file\nabout the authorization and service. • classes.dex: contains the dalvik byte-code, i.e., Android\nexecution file. • resource.asc: contains the binary resource file after com-\npilation. Fig. 3 shows the compilation process of Android APK. First we compile all of the Java source code, generating the .class byte-code. After that, all of the .class files are transformed into .dex format executable format. Dalvik VM is mainly developed by Google, with the minimal requirement on the resource. In other words, Dalvik VM can be run on the mobile devices with limited computing and memory resource but with acceptably performance.\nStatic analysis of signature-based method is one of the most common approaches for Android malware detection. The tools include Apktool, baksmalu, dex2jar, and JD-GUI, which are reverse-engineering tools for deriving Java or smali source code from classes.dex. Furthermore, AXMLPrinter2 can be used to derive the Android permission from AndroidManifest.xml. Another category of approaches for Android malware detection is dynamic analysis or behavior-based method. The idea behind this category is to keep track of the system communications and network connections by emulating Android apps. through techniques such as sandbox and virtual machine. The domain exports then perform the inspection and analysis on the records to see wether the malicious behaviours occur. If so, virus pattern and black/white-list are generated for pattern matching and for capturing the malware. However antianalysis techniques such as obfuscation, encryption, and antidebugging are also proposed by hacker to hide the malicious behaviours, and escaping the detection [3]. In fact, the above approaches can be useless when the malware programmers make modification on the initial components in malware, which can evade the detection.\nFig. 4 shows the popular class naming in benign Android apps (e.g. intellij.annotations and features2d). Fig. 5 shows the common way for declaring the data variables (e.g. paramBitmap and paramBitmap). However, to evade the detection, certain random naming (e.g. dsrhki.yjgfqjejkjh and nlrskgblc) will be used by \" opfake \" family (show in Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows that \" fakeinst \" family until encrypt the critical variables (e.g. jj = 84f113ee155ba4f1e280b54401fffab and jj1 = 84f113ee155ba43f1e280b54401fffab)."

      "text" : "Machine learning is a techniques for enabling the machine to learn the pattern, build the model, and make the prediction by seeing only the raw data. Currently, the most widespread malware attacks are still exploit attack and privileged escalation, as a result, most of the machine learning-based malware detection still find the features such as the Android apps permissions, API invocation and control flow graphs (CFG) in order to distinguish between the benign and malicious apps. Usually, SVM and random forest are used to build the model to distinguish between benign and malicious apps. For example, DroidMiner [4] has a two-step flow-chart to represent the behaviours of Android apps and capture the execution logs behind the apps. After that rectors are clustered to identity the similar code snippet. Lei Chen et al. [5] extracted features from Android API invocation as a reverse engineering approach. They apply normalization procedure to the extracted featuring and perform logistic regression on the extracted feature to detect Android malware. Moreover, the dataset used by the current research-oriented machine learning-based Android malware detection are rather small. Most of existing solutions train their detection models sorely based on the small datasets. This cause the practicality problem because the realworld malware may have distinguishing distinctive behaviors and the existing detection models cannot successfully identify the malware by correlating the API invocation and Android permissions."

      "text" : "The recent success in deep learning research and development attracts people’s attention [6]. In 2015, Google released Tensorflow [7], a framework of realizing deep learning algorithm. Deep learning is a specific type of machine learning, more specifically deep learning is an artificial neural network, in which multiple layers of neurons are interconnected with different weights and activation functions to learn the hidden relationship between input and output. Intuitively, input data are feeded to the first layer that generates different combinations of the input [8]. These combinations, after the activation function, are feeded to the second layer, and so on. Under the above procedures, different combinations of the outputs from the previously layer can be seen as different representation of features. The weights on links between layers are adjusted according forward and backward propagations, depending on the distance or less function between true output label and the label calculated by neural network. Note that deep learning can be seen as a neural network with a large number of layers. After the above learning process via multiple layers, we can derive a better understanding and representation of distinguishable features, enhancing the detection accuracy [9]. Also notice that the effectiveness of deep learning is increased with the network size. In addition to deep neural networks, the most well-known deep networks is convolutional neural networks (CNN). The representation of CNN include AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, and ResNet [10][11][12][13]. More specifically, CNN is composed of hidden layers, fully connected layers.\nconvolution layers, and pooling layers. The hidden layers are used to increase the complexity of the model. If the same number of neural are associated with the input image, the number of parameters can be significantly reduced, adapting to the function structure more properly."

      "text" : "Deep learning once can be seem as the care for the above problem. However, a pre-processing step, such as feature engineering, is still needed before the model is learn. Furthermore, the dataset for training the model cannot reflect real-world malware accurately. For example [14], propose a malware detection, which takes windows API invocation as the inputs of stack of Auto-Encoders and fine-tunes the model parameters [15]. Performs the feature extracting, such as contextual byte features, PE import features, string 2d histogram features, and PE metadata features. Then, the extracted features are feeded to the DNN. With two hidden layers, [16] uses static analysis to extract features such as required permission, sensitive API, and uses dynamic analysis to extract features such as actiondexclass-load, action-recrent and action-service start. After that, these features are feeded to deep belief network (DBN). There is similarity between the execution logic of Android malicious apps and the order of functions being called. Thus, in addition to the aforementioned solutions that apply DNN to malware analysis based on exploit attack and privileged escalation, another category of malware detection relies on ngram analysis on byte-code and op-code. For example, [17] and [18] first calculate the n-grams on the binary byte-code and then perform the malware detection based on k-nearest neighbor. [19] proposes to perform analysis on op-code of the reverse-engineering. In addition, one more category of the malware detection relies on transforming malware into the images. For example, [20] proposes to first transform binary byte-code into grayscale image and the apply pattern recognition on the image. All of the above methods achieves a certain level of detection accuracy. However, as mentioned in Section II, the number of malware is increased dramatically. Even worse, more and more anti-debugging techniques are discovered. The size of dataset used for training the model also has significant impacts on the detection accuracy and the training efficiency. Here, we particularly note that despite the detection accuracy of the n-gram approach. N-gram approach consumes substantial computing resources and time for handling the dynamic growth of the model parameters required, implying the impracticality [21]. However, CNN is able to handle the explosive data growth because the increased number of parameters does not imply the growth of computing resource and time required. Recently, [22] also proposes a deep learning-based malware detection, where the op-code sequences are encoded as one-hot vectors for the input of CNN. However, this method needs to dissemble the Android apps via backsmali, and therefore cannot handle malware with encryption and obfuscation, as show in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 [23], [24], [25]."

      "heading" : "A. The Advantage of Our Methodology",
      "text" : "As mentioned above, the majority of the malware detection still relies on the static analysis of source code and the dynamic analysis through monitoring the execution of malware. However, these approaches are known to have better detection accuracy for the same family of malware only. In reality, Android malware has dramatically growth in numbers and mutates with fast speed and with various anti-analysis techniques. All of these characteristics make the accurate detection extremely difficult. Thus, we attempt to find out the hidden relationship between the program execution logic and the order of function calls behind the malware by taking advantauge of the deep learning in order to accurately detect known and even unknown malware.\nSince the byte-code in classes.dex and rgb color code are both hexadecimal, we proposed a transformation algorithm that enables the byte-code as rgb color code. After that, we apply CNN to the images for the Android malware detection. Our R2-D2 method works by only decompressing Android apps and then translating the dalvik executable, classes.dex into color images. In fact, a huge amount of human labor will instead perform feature engineering and model before the detection model built. To ease the model training, we adopt deep learning to construct an end-to-end learning-based Android malware detection, which is termed as R2-D2 (R2D2: ColoR-inspired Convolutional NeuRal Network (CNN)based AndroiD Malware Detections). Our proposed R2-D2 possesses the following advantages:\n• R2-D2 translates classes.dex, the core of the execution logic of Android apps, into RGB color images, without modifying the original Android apps and without extracting features from apps. In our experiments, only 0.4 seconds suffice to translate an apps into a color image, such translation is also featured by the fact that more information in apps can be preserved in the color image compared to the grayscale image. • Though the fully connected layer of DNN can be used to handle the fast mutation, the CNN in R2-D2 actually is more suitable for capturing the malware, because of its features such as local receptive fields and shared weights that can not only significantly reduce the number of model parameters nut also represent the complex structure of Android malware. • The filter, pooling, and non-linear activation functions in CNN do not extract features from image for pattern recognition. Instead, the raw pixels are represented by multi-dimensional matrices."

Then, we decompress the apps to retrieve the classes.dex and present as byte-code. We then map the hexadecimal from byte-code to rgb color code through the rule show in Fig. 8. Finally, we will reach a color image (shown in Fig. 9 and 10), and the images are feed to CNN and training a model to detection Android malware. Fig. 11 is our system architecture."

We particularly note that the malware may have different variants and mutations, depending on the factors such as the cell-pone model, Android version, and the orographic regions. Thus Fig. 2 shows the basis for our classification depending on malware family and malware behavior. Fig. 13 shows the trend of different mlaware families particularly all of the world, and Fig. 14 shows the trend of different malware families particularly in China and India. Fig. 15 shows the market shares for different cell-phone models.

      "text" : "Based on our collected data, we evaluate the detection accuracy and performance with different optimization model techniques. Note that the learning rate is fixed to be 0.01, The model optimization techniques are stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), AdaDelta and AdaGrad. From our experiment, we find that Inception-v3 (show in Fig. 16) is almost always better than AlexNet (show in Fig. 17), with such as observation, we further compare Inception-v3 with AdaDelta and Inception-v3 with AdaGrad (see Fig. 18), and find that SGD is best suitable for our use. In particular, it results in the sharpest increase in accuracy and sharpest decrease in loss. At the end, we reach 98.4225% and 97.7081% accuracy (see Fig. 19).\nC. Validation on Real Environment\nTo infer the capability of our R2-D2 system in detection the unknown malware, we also collected Android apps on Google Play from February 2017. More specifically, we collected Android apps in different categories (e.g., weather, business, finance, travel, etc.) from the different countries (e.g., US, UK, France, Germany, etc. ). In addition, we also choose benign samples that none of VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com) vendor report malicious. We also selected malicious samples, the criteria for selecting malicious samples is that more than 30 VirusTotal vendors report malicious. We download some malicious samples from contagio (http://contagiominidump.blogspot.tw). As a summary, the above four sources of benign/malicious samples are used for verifying the detection capability of our R2D2 system. The evaluation metrics in our experiment include True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), True Negative (TN), Accucarcy (Acc), Precision (Prec), Recall (Detection Rate, DR), False Positive Rate (FPR) and F1-score (F-measure). The evaluation results are shown in Fig. 20. We can see that with the rapid generation and mutation of malware, even the detection model is trained based on our dataset with 1.5 million samples, the precision is highler than accuracy after the threshold 0.6. Moreover, when the threshold is over 0.7, recall and F1 -score start to drop, meaning that the detection accuracy is not as good as before, this phenomenon can confirm that thought R2-D2 is able to reduce the human labor and resource consumption, long-term sample collection and model updating are still necessary."

The most prominent feature of these apps are the extra module for downloading, and the request for Device Administrator permission. These apps then promote deceptive advertisements. These apps have been removed by Google Play,. However, if they can be detected in the first place\nwithout feature extraction, they can fluctuation of Android malware can be mitigated. From Fig. 21, we can find that most of the above Minecraft malware can be detected by approximately 16% vendors (10/60) on 2017/03/24. Until 2017/03/30, approximately 32% vendors (20/60) can detect these malware. For example, Fig. 22 shows the detection results of \"hash\". However, R2-D2 can detect more than 75% of these apps.

    "abstractText" : "Machine Learning (ML) has found it particularly useful in malware detection. However, as the malware evolves very fast, the stability of the feature extracted from malware serves as a critical issue in malware detection. The recent success of deep learning in image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation indicates a potential solution for stabilizing the malware detection effectiveness. In this research, we haven’t extract selected any features (e.g., the control-flow of op-code, classes, methods of functions and the timing they are invoked etc.) from Android apps. We develop our own method for translating Android apps into rgb color code and transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. After that, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, reducing the expert’s intervention. Deep learning usually involves a large number of parameters that cannot be learned from only a small dataset. In this way, we currently have collected 1500k Android apps samples, have run our system over these 800k malware samples (benign and malicious samples are roughly equal-sized), and also through our back-end (60 million monthly active users and 10k new malware samples per day), we can effectively detect the malware. We believe that our methodology and the corresponding use of deep learning malware classification can overcome the weakness, and computational cost of the common static/dynamic analysis process or machine learning-based of Android malware detection approach.",
