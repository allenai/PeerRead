      "text" : "How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many NLP tasks such as answer selection (AS) (Yu et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2015), paraphrase identification (PI) (Madnani et al., 2012; Yin and Schütze, 2015a), textual entailment (TE) (Marelli et al., 2014a; Bowman et al., 2015a) and machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015).\nMost prior work models each sentence separately, without considering the impact of the other sen-\ntence. This neglects the mutual influence of the two sentences in the context of the task. It also contradicts what humans do when comparing two sentences. We usually focus on key parts of the first sentence by extracting parts from the second sentence that are related by identity, synomymy, antonymy and other relations. Thus, human beings model the two sentences together, using the content of one sentence to guide the representation of the other.\nFigure 1 demonstrates that each sentence of a pair partially determines which parts of the other sentence we should focus on. For AS, correctly answering s0 requires putting attention on “gross”: s+1 contains a corresponding element (“earned”) while s−1 does not. For PI, focus should be removed from “today” to correctly recognize (<s0, s+1 >) as paraphrases and (< s0, s−1 >) as non-paraphrases. For TE, we need to focus on either “full of people” (to recognize TE for < s0, s+1 >) or on “outdoors” / “indoors” (to recognize non-TE for < s0, s−1 >). These examples show the need for an architecture that computes different representations of si for dif-\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n05 19\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 D\nec 2\nferent si−1’s (i ∈ {0, 1}). In this paper, we present such an architecture: ABCNN, an attention-based convolutional neural network that has a powerful mechanism for modeling a sentence pair by taking into account the interdependence between the two sentences. ABCNN is a general architecture that can handle a wide variety of sentence pair modeling tasks.\nSome prior work proposes simple mechanisms that can be interpreted as controlling varying attention; e.g., Yih et al. (2013) employ word alignment to match related parts of the two sentences. In contrast, our attention scheme based on CNN is able to model relatedness between two parts fully automatically. Moreover, attention at multiple levels of granularity, not only at the word level, is achieved as we stack multiple convolution layers that increase abstraction. As far as we know, this is the first NLP paper that incorporates attention into CNNs.\nSection 2 discusses related work. Section 3 introduces BCNN, a network that models two sentences in parallel with shared weights, but without attention. Section 4 presents three different attention mechanisms and their realization in ABCNN, an architecture that is based on BCNN. Section 5 evaluates the models on AS, PI and TE tasks."

      "text" : "There has been a lot of neural network research on modeling sentence pairs for AS, PI and TE. For AS, Yu et al. (2014) present a bigram CNN to model question and answer candidates. Yang et al. (2015) extend this method and get state-of-the-art performance on the the WikiQA dataset (Section 5.2). Feng et al. (2015) test various setups of a bi-CNN architecture on an insurance domain QA dataset. Tan et al. (2015) explored bidirectional long shortterm memory (LSTM, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997)) in the same insurance-based dataset. Our approach is different because do not model the sentences by two independent neural networks in parallel, but instead as an interdependent sentence pair, using attention.\nFor PI, Blacoe and Lapata (2012) form sentence representations by summing up word embeddings. Socher et al. (2011) use recursive autoencoder (RAE) to model representations of local\nphrases in sentences, then pool similarity values of phrases from the two sentences as features for binary classification. Yin and Schütze (2015a) present a similar model in which RAE is replaced by CNN. In all three papers, each sentence’s representation is not influenced by the other’s – in contrast to our attention-based model.\nFor TE, Bowman et al. (2015b) employ recursive neural networks to encode entailment on SICK (Marelli et al., 2014b). Rocktäschel et al. (2015) present an attention-based LSTM for the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus (Bowman et al., 2015a). Our system is the first CNN-based work.\nSome prior work aims to solve a general sentence matching problem. Hu et al. (2014) present two CNN architectures, ARC-I and ARC-II, for sentence matching. ARC-I focuses on sentence representation learning while ARC-II focuses on matching features on phrase level. Both systems were tested on sentence completion (SC), Tweet-Response matching and PI tasks. Yin and Schütze (2015b) propose the more flexible MultiGranCNN architecture to model general sentence matching based on phrase matching on multiple levels on granularity and get promising results for PI and SC. Wan et al. (2015) try to match two sentences in AS and SC by multiple sentence representations, each coming from the local representations of two LSTMs. Our work is the first one to investigate attention for the general sentence matching task."

      "text" : "We now introduce our basic (non-attention) CNN that is based on Siamese architecture, i.e., it consists of two weight-sharing CNNs, each processing one of the two sentences, and a final layer that solves the sentence pair task. See Figure 2. We refer to this architecture as BCNN. The next section will then introduce an attention architecture that extends BCNN. Table 1 gives our notational conventions.\nIn our implementation and also in the mathematical formalization of the model given below, we pad the two sentences to have the same length s = max(s0, s1). However, in the figures we show different lengths because this gives a better intuition of how the model works.\nBCNN has four types of layers.\nInput layer. In the example in the figure, the two input sentences have 5 and 7 words, respectively. Each word is represented as a d0-dimensional precomputed word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) embedding,1 d0 = 300. As a result, each sentence is represented as a feature map of dimension d0 × s.\nConvolution layer. Let v1, v2, . . . , vs be the words of a sentence and ci ∈ Rwd0 , 0 < i < s + w, the concatenated embeddings of vi−w+1, . . . , vi where embeddings for vi, i < 1 and i > s, are set to zero. We then generate the representation pi ∈ Rd1 for the phrase vi−w+1, . . . , vi using the convolution\n1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\nweights W ∈ Rd1×wd0 as follows:\npi = tanh(W · ci + b) (1)\nwhere b ∈ Rd1 is the bias. We use wide convolution; i.e., we apply the convolution weights W to words vi, i < 1 and i > s, because this makes sure that each word vi, 1 ≤ i ≤ s, can be detected by all weights in W – as opposed to only the rightmost (resp. leftmost) weights for initial (resp. final) words in narrow convolution.\nAverage pooling layer. Pooling (max, min, average etc) is commonly used to extract robust features from convolution. In this paper, we introduce attention weighting as an alternative, but use average pooling as a baseline as follows. For the output feature map of the last convolution layer, we do column-wise averaging over all columns, denoted as all-ap. This will generate a representation vector for each of the two sentences, shown as the top “Average pooling (all-ap)” layer below “Logistic regression” in Figure 2. These two representations are then the basis for the sentence pair decision.\nFor the output feature map of non-final convolution layers, we do column-wise averaging over windows of w consecutive columns, denoted as w-ap; shown as the lower “Average pooling (w-ap)” layer in Figure 2. For filter width w, a non-final convolution layer transforms an input feature map of s columns into a new feature map of s + w − 1 columns; average pooling transforms this back to s columns. This architecture supports stacking an arbitrary number of convolution-pooling blocks to extract increasingly abstract features. Input features to the bottom layer are words, input features to the next layer are short phrases and so on. Each level generates more abstract features of higher granularity.\nOutput layer. The last layer is an output layer, chosen according to the task; e.g., for binary classification tasks, this layer is logistic regression (see Figure 2). Other output layers are introduced below.\nWe found that in most cases, performance is boosted if we provide the output of all pooling layers as input to the output layer. For each non-final average pooling layer, we perform w-ap (pooling over windows of w columns) as described above, but we also perform all-ap (pooling over all columns) and forward the result to the output layer. This\nimproves performance because representations from different layers cover the properties of the sentences at different levels of abstraction and all of these levels can be important for a particular sentence pair."

      "heading" : "4.1 ABCNN-1",
      "text" : "ABCNN-1 employs an attention feature matrix A to influence convolution. Attention features are intended to weight those units of si more highly in convolution that are relevant to a unit of s1−i (i ∈ {0, 1}); we use the term “unit” here to refer to words on the lowest level and to phrases on higher levels of the network. Figure 3(a) shows two unit representation feature maps in red: this part of ABCNN-1 is the same as in BCNN (see Figure 2). Each column is the representation of a unit, a word on the lowest level and a phrase on higher levels. We first describe the attention feature matrix A informally (layer “Conv input”, middle column, in Figure 3(a)). A is generated by matching units of the left matrix with units of the right matrix such that the attention values of row i in A denote the attention distribution of the i-th unit of s0 with respect to s1 and the attention values of column j in A denote the attention distribution of the j-th unit of s1 with respect to s0. A can be viewed as a new feature map of s0 (resp. s1) in row (resp. column) direction because each row (resp. column) is a new feature vector of a unit in s0 (resp. s1). Thus, it makes sense to combine this new feature map with the representation feature maps and use both as input to convolution. We achieve this by transforming A into the two blue matrices in Figure 3(a) that have the same format as the representation feature maps. As a result, the new input of convolution has two feature maps for each sentence (shown in red and blue). Our motivation is that the attention feature map will guide the convolution to learn “counterpart-biased” sentence representations.\nMore formally, let Fi,r ∈ Rd×s be the representation feature map of sentence i (i ∈ {0, 1}). Then we\ndefine the attention matrix A ∈ Rs×s as follows:\nAi,j = match-score(F0,r[:, i],F1,r[:, j]) (2)\nThe function match-score can be defined in a variety of ways. We found that 1/(1 + |x− y|) works well where | · | is Euclidean distance.\nGiven attention matrix A, we generate the attention feature map Fi,a for si as follows:\nF0,a = W0 ·Aᵀ (3) F1,a = W1 ·A (4)\nThe weight matrices W0 ∈ Rd×s, W1 ∈ Rd×s are parameters of the model to be learned in training.2\nWe stack the representation feature map Fi,r and the attention feature map Fi,a as an order 3 tensor and feed it into convolution to generate a higherlevel representation feature map for si (i ∈ {0, 1}). In Figure 3(a), s0 has has 5 units, s1 has 7. The output of convolution (shown in the top layer, filter width w = 3) is a higher-level representation feature map with 7 columns for s0 and 9 columns for s1."

      "text" : "ABCNN-1 computes attention weights directly on the representation with the aim of improving the features computed by convolution. ABCNN-2 instead computes attention weights on the output of convolution with the aim of reweighting this convolution output. In the example shown in Figure 3(b), the feature maps output by convolution for s0 and s1 have 7 and 9 columns, respectively; each column is the representation of a unit. The attention matrix A compares all units in s0 with all units of s1. We sum all attention values for a unit to derive a single attention weight for that unit. This corresponds to summing all values in a row of A for s0 (resulting in the column vector of size 7 shown) and summing all values in a column for s1 (resulting in the row vector of size 9 shown).\nMore formally, let A ∈ Rs×s be the attention matrix, a0,j = ∑ A[j, :] the attention weight of unit j\nin s0, a1,j = ∑\nA[:, j] the attention weight of unit j in s1 and Fci,r ∈ Rd×(si+w−1) the output of convolution for si.

This allows us to stack multiple convolution-plus-pooling blocks to extract features of increasing abstraction.\nThere are three main differences between ABCNN-1 and ABCNN-2. (i) Attention in ABCNN-1 impacts convolution indirectly while attention in ABCNN-2 influences pooling through direct attention weighting. (ii) ABCNN-1 requires the two matrices Wi to convert the attention matrix into attention feature maps; and the input to convolution has two times as many features maps. Thus, ABCNN-1 has more paramaters than ABCNN-2 and is more vulnerable to overfitting. (iii) As pooling appears after convolution, pooling handles larger-granularity units than convolution; e.g., if the input to convolution has word level granularity, then the input to pooling has phrase level granularity, the phrase size being equal to filter size w. Thus, ABCNN-1 and ABCNN-2 implement attention mechanisms for linguistic units of different granularity. This is exactly the motivation for the third ABCNN architecture, ABCNN-3."

A single randomly initialized embedding3 is created for all unknown words by uniform sampling from [-.01,.01]. We employ Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and L2 regularization.\nNetwork configuration. Each network in the experiments below consists of (i) an initialization block b1 that initializes words by word2vec embeddings, (ii) a stack of k − 1 convolution-pooling blocks b2, . . . , bk, computing increasingly abstract features, and (ii) one final LR layer (logistic regression layer) as shown in Figure 2.\nThe input to the LR layer consists of kn features – each block provides n similarity scores (such as cosine similarity). Figure 2 shows the two sentence vectors output by the final block bk of the stack; this is the basis of the last n similarity scores. As we explained in the final paragraph of Section 3, we perform all-ap pooling for all blocks, not just for bk. Thus we get one sentence representation each for s0 and s1 for each block b1, · · · , bk. We compute n similarity scores for each block (based on the two sentence representations) and forward these kn scores as input to the LR layer.\nDepending on the task, we use different methods for computing the similarity score: see below.\nLayerwise training. In our training regime, we first train a network consisting of just one convpooling block b2. We then create a two-block network, initialize its first block with b2 and train b3 keeping the previously learned weights for b2 fixed. We repeat this procedure until all k − 1 convpooling blocks are trained. We found that this training regime gives us good performance and shortens training times considerably. Since similarity scores of lower blocks are kept unchanged once they have been learned, this also has the nice effect that “simple” similarity scores (those based on surface features) are learned first and subsequent training phases can focus on complementary scores derived from more complex abstract features.\nClassifier. We found that performance increases if we do not use the output of the LR layer as the final decision, but instead train linear SVM or logistic regression with default parameters4 directly on the input to the LR layer (i.e., on the input that is gen-\n3This worked better than discarding unknown words. 4We use http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ for both.\nerated by the k-block stack after network training is completed).

Comparing ABCNN-2 with ABCNN-1, we find ABCNN-2 is slightly better even though ABCNN-2 is the simpler architecture. If we combine ABCNN-1 and ABCNN-2 to form ABCNN-3, we get further improvement.6\nThis can be explained by ABCNN-3’s ability to take attention of more fine-grained granularity into consideration in each convolution-pooling block while ABCNN-1 and ABCNN-2 consider attention only at convolution input or only at pooling input, respectively. We also find that stacking two convolution-pooling blocks does not bring consistent improvement and therefore do not test deeper architectures.\nIn summary, the attention mechanism performs better by a large margin on answer selection than previous work that does not use attention.

Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence separately, without considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually designed, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of sentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a wide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNN; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its counterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more powerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.",
