However, guidelines printed on paper are difficult to use efficiently during medical consultation [2]. This has led to the development of decision support systems (DSS) based on the CG [3]. The ASTI project in France provides an example of such a system. This DSS aims to improve therapeutic care for patients with chronic diseases, by helping physicians to take into account the recommendations expressed in CG [4]. ASTI includes a critiquing module — a rulebased system composed of a knowledge base and an inference engine [5, 6]. This module is automatically activated when the physician writes a drug prescription; it compares the treatment proposed by the physician with that recommended by the CG, and issues an alert if they differ. ASTI has been applied to several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes.\n1Corresponding Author: Jean-Baptiste Lamy, LIMBIO, UFR SMBH, Université Paris 13, 74 rue Marcel Cachin, 93017 Bobigny cedex, France; E-mail: jibalamy@free.fr.\nBefore their use in real clinical situations, DSS such as ASTI must be extensively tested to ensure their medical validity. Errors may be encountered at various levels: in the knowledge base, in the inference engine or in the system specifications. Few papers on the testing of medical DSS have been published, although knowledge-based system verification has been widely studied outside the medical domain. Preece [7, 8] distinguishes between two types of verification method. Static methods do not require the DSS to be run. They involve the inspection of the knowledge base by an expert, or checking for syntactic errors, logical errors (e.g. unsatisfiable conditions) or semantic errors (e.g. a male patient being pregnant) in the knowledge base [9]. These methods may identify errors, but cannot ensure the total absence of errors [7, 10].\nDynamic methods involve the running of the DSS with a test base. The test base may be written manually, or using automatic methods aiming to identify the “most relevant” test cases [10, 11]. The intervention of a human expert is required to determine whether the responses of the DSS are satisfactory. These methods therefore cannot be used for the systematic testing of all possible test cases, as there are generally too many such cases for manual review by an expert.\nWe aimed to check the conformity of the ASTI critiquing module to the CG used to design it — the French CG for type 2 diabetes [12]. We present a new dynamic verification method for ``rebuilding'' the knowledge contained in the CG from an exhaustive set of test cases, using machine learning techniques to construct a decision tree. We applied this method to the ASTI critiquing module for type 2 diabetes, and present the results of a comparison, by an expert, of the generated decision tree with the original CG. Finally, we discuss the potential value of such a method and possibilities of applying this method to other DSS."

Finally, the output associated with each input vector is obtained by running the DSS."

Pruning must be disabled, to ensure\n0% error in the tree. Factorization rules are applied to reduce the size of the tree: (1) if all the children of a given node include the same element of a recommendation (e.g. a recommended drug treatment), this element of information can be included in the node and removed from its children, (2) if a variable can take several values leading to the same recommendations, the largest set of such values can be grouped together as “<other>”."

For type 2 diabetes, these inputs correspond to the variables shown in Table 1. Doses were taken into account, using the following rule: if the treatment proposed is the same as the current treatment, the dose is understood to be modified: reduced if the problem identified was poor tolerance, and increased if the problem identified was low efficiency. A few rules were used to eliminate unrealistic combinations. For example, if the current treatment is diet, there cannot be drug intolerance.\nCombinations of the values given in Table 1 generated an almost exhaustive set of input vectors. Only cases in which the patient had more than one drug intolerance, and cases involving quadritherapies (which are never recommended by the CG) were excluded. This approach yielded 147,680 input vectors."

      "text" : "The data were initially processed so that the list of valid treatments was used as the classifying variable, rather than the critiquing module’s output (i.e. conform, not optimal or non conform). The decision tree was then built using the C4.5 algorithm. Before the factorization rules described in the methods section were applied, the decision tree included 87 nodes. After the application of these rules, the final tree included only 60 nodes (see Figure 1). For a patient with a BMI of 25 kg/m² and an HbA1c level of 7%, with a current treatment of diet plus metformin shown to be inefficient, the decision tree recommends a first-line treatment of diet + metformin (with a higher dose of metformin as the\nrecommended treatment is the same as the current treatment, see section 3.1), diet + glinide, diet + sulfonamide, diet + metformin + glinide or diet + metformin + sulfonamide, and a second-line treatment of diet + glinide + alphaglucosidaseinhibitors (AGI), diet + metformin + AGI, diet + sulfonamide + AGI, diet + metformin + glinide, diet + metformin + sulfonamide or diet + metformin + glitazone.\nFor a patient with a BMI of 29 kg/m² and an HbA1c level of 6.8%, with a current treatment of diet plus metformin, and who does not tolerate the metformin, the decision tree recommends a first-line treatment of diet + AGI, and a second-line treatment of diet + glinide or diet + sulfonamide. However, decreasing the dose of the metformin is not recommended."

The experts found the decision tree to be easily readable, although one of them was at first confused by the use of only two levels of treatment intention on the tree.

They also ensured that the various branches of the tree lead to the same prescription that the CG. Consequently, the experts considered the tree to conform to the CG."

      "heading" : "3 Discussion and conclusion",
      "text" : "The verification method proposed made it possible to test the ASTI critiquing module for type 2 diabetes in an almost systematic manner. It also gives an overview of the DSS reasoning. The knowledge extracted from the DSS was represented using rules and decision lists as alternatives to decision trees. Rules were more verbose than the tree. The decision list was a little more concise, but it was easier to compare the tree with the textual CG, due to the tree-like sectioning of the CG. Other algorithms could be used, e.g. for controlling the tree's optimality. We tried to insert errors by deleting arbitrary rules in ASTI's knowledge base; these errors were clearly visible in the decision tree and were found by the experts.\nThe method proposed here has several advantages. First, it permits almost systematic testing. ASTI was preliminary tested with a hand-written test based on 796 input vectors. The method used here involved about 150,000 input vectors — three orders of magnitude greater than initially tested. Second, this method tests not only the DSS knowledge base, but also the inference engine. The decision tree obtained is not a simple conversion of the rule-based knowledge base into a decision tree. Indeed, the inference engine of the ASTI critiquing module includes several hard-coded generic rules: e.g. if the patient tolerated a drug poorly in the past, it should not be prescribed again, unless its dose is decreased. The decision tree took into account the knowledge base, but also these generic rules, including any possible bugs in the inference engine.\nFinally, the method proposed considers the DSS as a black box, and thus makes no assumptions about its internal functioning. This method could therefore be applied to many other DSS, independently from the DSS reasoning method: rule-based system, hard-coded rules, decision tree, neural network, or any other algorithm. All DSS based on a human-readable source of knowledge, such as a CG, are eligible (by opposition to\ne.g. a DSS using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm), which includes most of medical knowledge based DSS. To apply our testing method, one should first identify the DSS inputs, generate an almost exhaustive set of input vectors, and run the DSS for each of them. Then, one should extract knowledge from the input vectors and output data, using C4.5 or another learning algorithm. Finally, one should ask a human expert to compare the extracted knowledge to the knowledge that was used to build the DSS.\nThree problems might be encountered when applying this method. First, it can be difficult to generate an almost exhaustive set of the DSS's input vectors, in particular when the number of variables is very high, e.g. for hypertension CG, or when there are many continuous variables. However medical recommendations usually define threshold values that allow to discretize continuous variable easily, as we have done for diabetes type 2. Second, it might be impossible to generate in a reasonable time the outputs for all input vectors (DSS too slow or too many vectors). Third, learning algorithms might be unadapted to the knowledge used by the DSS. For example, rule conditions such as ``if the patient has two or more risk factors from a given list...'' cannot be learnt by C4.5. To solve this problem, one can use more sophisticated learning algorithms, e.g. based on description logic, or derive input variables from the other variables, e.g. the number of risk factors could be added as an input variable.\nIn conclusion, the ASTI critiquing module for type 2 diabetes was almost exhaustively tested in this study, using an original black-box dynamic verification method. This method appears generic and therefore applicable to other medical DSS."
