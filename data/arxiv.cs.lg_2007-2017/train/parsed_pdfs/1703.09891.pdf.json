      "text" : "Great progress has been made in visual recognition. In tasks ranging from image classification to object detection, algorithms rival human performance in certain conditions. Semantic segmentation, labeling each pixel to depict semantic elements by detailed shapes and contours, is arguably a requisite element of full visual understanding of a scene. For applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, or other scene understanding endeavours, accurate delineation of object contours is necessary for success.\nHowever, detailed semantic segmentation is challenging – there exists significant ambiguity in fine-scale image\n∗equal contribution.\npatches that can result in noisy semantic segmentation outputs. The main focus of this paper is utilizing holistic information to filter noisy low-level semantic segmentation (see Figure 1). We term this holistic representation LabelBank, specifically defined as a continuous vector of confidences of which objects are likely to be present in an image.\nThis holistic LabelBank can be derived from a variety of sources. Akin to image classification, one could directly infer object content from global visual features describing an image (c.f. the seminal ObjectBank work [24]). Further, this information can be extracted more generally – in many scenarios we have additional meta data such as sentences\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n09 89\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n9 M\ndescribing an image or tag-style labels regarding image attributes. We demonstrate that our framework can be utilized in a range of settings, from purely visual information (no additional data beyond the image pixels) to situations where additional meta data are present.\nWe instantiate our ideas within a single framework for inferring the LabelBank representation and utilizing it for semantic segmentation. This framework can be used in common with a variety of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks. State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation leverage the successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [23]. CNNs have transformed the field of image classification, especially since the development of AlexNet [20]. There have been many follow-up CNN architectures to further boost image classification, including VGGNet [36], Google Inception [37], ResNet [14], etc. Semantic segmentation utilizes these network structures, combined with dense output structures to label image pixels by semantic categories. A representative work is the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [34] that leverages skip features of CNNs to produce a detailed pixel labeling. Another example is the DeepLab [4] framework, which augments FCN with dilated convolution [40], atrous spatial pyramid pooling and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and obtains state-of-art semantic segmentation performance.\nCommon among these previous semantic segmentation methods is a focus on (layers of) low-level pixel analysis leading to semantic segmentation. State-of-the-art techniques combine this with graphical model-style techniques (CRF) and pooling structures to obtain high accuracy. The role of these additional components is to smooth out the noisy pixel labelings that result from the direct CNN analysis. As a complementary approach, we advocate for a holistic inference of LabelBank that globally suggests category labels that are likely to be present in the image.\nTo make use of the LabelBank representation in semantic segmentation, we leverage it to filter out false-positive pixel predictions – if the holistic information in the LabelBank suggests a semantic category is unlikely to be present, then pixels should be unlikely to be predicted as that label. We utilize these observations to propose a framework that unifies a LabelBank inference process and a detailed semantic segmentation process via a holistic filtering process. Our framework is generic and flexible enough to leverage different data sources / architectures in LabelBank inference and can integrate state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks. For example, the LabelBank can be derived from cues ranging from image appearance to attributes to textual descriptions. The semantic segmentation process can be implemented using state-of-the-art approaches, such as FCN [34] and DilatedNet [40, 4]. Finally, our holistic filtering leverages the information in the LabelBank to guide segmentation by refining noisy pixel predictions.\nContribution. We summarize our main contributions as: • First, we develop LabelBank to guide semantic segmen-\ntation, where LabelBank is a holistic representation of image content that can be derived from various sources. • Second, we construct holistic filtering that enables us to filter out false-positive pixel predictions under the guidance of LabelBank. • Third, we propose a neural network framework for semantic segmentation. We implement approaches for inferring LabelBank and conducting semantic segmentation, which facilitate the flow of global image information to pixel segmentation. Our framework is general, and could be incorporated into a variety of CNN-based semantic segmentation architectures. • Finally, we evaluate our proposed framework on standard semantic segmentation datasets: PASCAL-Context [31], ADE20K [42], COCO-Stuff [3], NYUDv2 [35] and SIFT-Flow [27]. Experimental results show that the proposed LabelBank-based framework can be used to improve a variety of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches."

      "text" : "Semantic segmentation. The success of CNNs in object recognition has led to renewed attention on semantic segmentation. A representative work is the Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) [34] that uses skip features of CNNs for detailed pixel labeling. FCN combines multi-level feature descriptors to leverage coarse-to-fine local pixel information. In a recent advance, the atrous convolution is introduced by Chen et al. [4] as a technique to retain a large field of view while keeping fewer trainable weights in semantic segmentation networks. The same method termed as dilated convolution was also pursued by Yu and Koltun [40] by a cascading series of dilated convolution layers.\nAnother line of work pushes on refining the detailed shapes and contours of semantic segmentation. A fully connected CRF is proposed by Krähenbühl and Koltun [19] as an efficient dense pixel modeling method. The fully connected pairwise CRF is adopted by Chen et al. [4] and Zheng et al. [41] on top of FCNs as a further refinement. These methods have achieved considerable improvement on the semantic segmentation task. Different from the abovementioned methods, our work leverages holistic LabelBank to filter out false-positive pixel predictions. Global-local information fusion. It has been shown that visual understanding benefits from exploiting and leveraging information of varying granularity. Deng et al. [8] modeled hierarchical and exclusive relations among semantic categories. Jain et al. [17] developed recurrent neural network structures for spatio-temporal inference. Hu et al. [16] proposed a neural graph inference model to propagate information among multiple levels of visual classes, in-\ncluding coarse labels, fine-grained categories and attributes. Amer et al. [1] adopted the and-or graph structure to reason about human activities at multiple levels of granularity. Gkioxari et al. [10] exploited contextual cues to improve action recognition.\nIn the realm of semantic segmentation, He et al. [15] proposed to use multi-scale CRFs to capture features at various image resolutions for semantic segmentation. Approaches for modeling object instances and their segmentations have also been developed [21, 39]. Another example of this line improves instance-aware semantic segmentation with object detection and classification [6, 7]. In contrast, we exploit holistic LabelBank for semantic segmentation, and do not require instance-level annotations."

Recall that the LabelBank is defined as a continuous vector of confidences for the presence of semantic object categories in an image.\nFigure 2 provides an overview of our framework. In detail, it is composed of three components. First, we have a holistic inference process that takes varied information sources to reason about the LabelBank representation of an image. Second, we have a detailed semantic segmentation process to conduct preliminary semantic segmentation on the image to generate a segmentation map. Finally, we have a holistic filtering process that leverages the inferred LabelBank to filter out false-positive pixel predictions in the preliminary semantic segmentation results.\nOur framework is generic and can flexibly incorporate various data sources / architectures in LabelBank inference, leveraging different semantic segmentation networks. For example, the LabelBank can be derived from a variety of data sources, ranging from purely visual appearance to the cases where additional meta data are available, such as sentences describing image content and tag-like labels on image attributes. The LabelBank inference architecture also\nvaries depending on the available data sources. Furthermore, our semantic segmentation process is also generic, and can be implemented with state-of-the-art CNN-based network architectures like FCN [34] or DilatedNet [40, 4]. In our implementation, we slightly modified FCN and DilatedNet for improved performance, by replacing the linear pixel classifier with a non-linear two-layer CNN. Due to space limitations, we present the details in the appendix.\nWe report our experimental results in Section 4 to verify the generalizability and effectiveness of our framework. In what follows, we first describe our holistic filtering process in Section 3.1, and then present our exemplar implementations of LabelBank inference in Section 3.2."

      "heading" : "3.1. Holistic Filtering",
      "text" : "Holistic filtering is a key component in our framework. It uses the LabelBank representation derived from the holistic inference process to actively filter out false-positive pixel predictions in the segmentation map generated by the semantic segmentation process. Note that a segmentation map is typically organized as a matrix of confidences for assigning each semantic category label on each image pixel. Our idea is to use the LabelBank to recommend labels for pixel predictions – if LabelBank suggests a semantic label is unlikely to be present, then pixels should be unlikely to be predicted as that label as well.\nTo implement the idea, we weight the segmentation map predictions on each pixel by the LabelBank confidences. The weighting is done by a multiplication of both LabelBank and segmentation confidences transformed in a sigmoidal space. In the sigmoidal space, unlikely labels tend to receive low confidences close to 0, and likely labels tend to have high confidences close to 1. Therefore, the final confidence after the multiplication is high only if both the LabelBank and segmentation confidences are high. The final confidence is low whenever either the LabelBank confidence or the segmentation confidence is low. The detailed holistic filtering process is illustrated in Figure 2.\nFormally, we denote the LabelBank representation of an\nimage by a vector c ∈ Rk×1×1, where k is the total number of semantic labels of interest. Each element of c indicates the confidence of observing the corresponding semantic category in the image. We also denote S ∈ Rk×h×w as the segmentation map generated by the semantic segmentation process, where each element of S stores the confidence of observing a semantic category at the corresponding image location. Note that the segmentation map size h × w is typically smaller than the original image size H ×W , due to the pooling or down-sampling operations employed by most semantic segmentation networks (e.g., FCN [34] and DilatedNet [40, 4]).\nWe first map the LabelBank c and the segmentation map S to a sigmoidal space via:\ncσ = [ σ(cl) ]l=k l=1 , Sσ = [ σ(Sl,i,j) ]l=k,i=h,j=w l=1,i=1,j=1 , (1)\nwhere σ(x) = 11+e−x is the sigmoid function. To weight each location of the segmentation map by the LabelBank, we replicate cσ to obtain an expanded LabelBank Cσ ∈ Rk×h×w of the same size as the segmentation map. Note that the confidence vector of the expanded LabelBank at each location is a copy of the LabelBank, i.e.,\nCσ:,i,j = c σ, ∀1 ≤ i ≤ h, 1 ≤ j ≤ w. (2)\nWe then conduct element-wise multiplication of the expanded LabelBank and the segmentation map to filter out false-positive predictions in the segmentation map. The refined segmentation map is computed as:\nSr = Cσ Sσ. (3)\nIn Sr, a location receives a high confidence on a label only if both the LabelBank and the original pixel prediction are highly confident of predicting that label.\nFinally, we apply a logit function (i.e., the inverse sigmoid function) on each element of the refined segmentation map, so that the final confidences share the same value domain as the original segmentation map S. Formally, the LabelBank filtered segmentation map is derived as:\nSf = [ `(Srl,i,j) ]l=k,i=h,j=w l=1,i=1,j=1 , (4)\nwhere `(x) = log( x1−x ) is the logit function. Note that all operations in our holistic filtering process are differentiable for gradient back-propagation to enable end-to-end training.\nAs Sf is typically sized smaller than the original image, we apply an up-sampling operation to generate a full semantic segmentation map. The up-sampling is simply done by bi-linear interpolation (following [4]) to increase the resolution to the original image size. We could also switch the order of up-sampling and holistic filtering in the pipeline to leverage LabelBank to refine the full segmentation map. This results in slightly better empirical performance, but increases the computational cost significantly. We keep upsampling after holistic filtering for the sake of efficiency."

We present two exemplar visual inference architectures in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, but other architectures are possible and can be easily adopted in our framework. Moreover, the LabelBank can also be derived from commonly available image meta data, such as tagbased labels on image attributes or sentences describing the image content. We implement sample architectures in Section 3.2.3 for this purpose. Furthermore, we have also experimented with combined visual appearance and meta data for a more accurate LabelBank representation.\nTo design the architectures, we would like to emphasize the following two principles. First, we prefer a process that takes an image and / or its meta data as input and produces the LabelBank representation as output, where the gradient can be back-propagated through for end-to-end training. Second, the architectures should not require any additional supervision beyond the readily available pixel labels in training data. The pixel labels have already depicted the semantic objects in the images, and we should make use of them in LabelBank inference."

Then it applies spatial pyramid pooling on the feature map, followed by a multi-layer perception to predict the LabelBank.\nFor training purposes, we obtain ground-truth LabelBank from the ground-truth pixel labels – an image is labeled by a semantic category if there is at least one pixel labeled with that category.

Thus, we conduct location-aware predictions that inspect densely cropped image windows.\nFor implementation, we first apply the same feature network as the SPP architecture. Then we densely crop the feature map to obtain features on image windows for locationaware predictions. We implement a two-layer CNN structure as the prediction model (details in the appendix). Each location-aware prediction results in a k-dimensional vector that describes the confidences for each semantic category to appear in the corresponding image window. Finally, we compose the LabelBank representation by a max-pooling over the location-aware predictions.\nWe impose a loss on the location-aware predictions. Specifically, the ground-truth labels on each image window are derived from the ground-truth pixel labels – an image window is labeled by a semantic category as long as the image window has at least one pixel labeled with that category. We first apply a sigmoid activation layer on the output of the location-aware predictions, and then evaluate a categorical cross-entropy loss."

We have described the LabelBank inference losses in the above subsections. The segmentation loss is enforced on the full segmentation map obtained from holistic filtering. Following the standard setting of semantic segmentation [34, 4], we first apply a softmax activation layer to the full segmentation map,\nand then compute a categorical cross-entropy loss for the segmentation task.

However, we did not use extra training data (e.g. the COCO dataset) and domain adaptation to obtain a better model. We applied neither CRFs to smooth the segmentation results, nor multi-scale test to refine segmentation at various image granularities.

The oracle LabelBank can be simply derived from the ground-truth pixel labels, by taking the value of infinity if a semantic class is present in the image, and negative infinity otherwise. We keep the rest of the framework intact, and train it end-to-end towards optimizing the segmentation loss (see Section 3.2.4 for details).\nWe compare FCN+, DC + FCN+, and Oracle + FCN+ in Figure 4.

We start with the oracle LabelBank, and contaminate it to certain precision and recall levels. Specifically, we degrade the precision by adding in more and more noisy image labels, and degrade the recall by removing more and more ground-truth image labels. We experimented with a FCN+ based semantic segmentation network, and leveraged the noisy LabelBank in holistic filtering. Due to computational resource limitations, we did not retrain the FCN+ networks (as we have done for Oracle + FCN+). Detailed experimental setup is provided in the supplementary material.\nFigure 5 plots the mean IU grid.

We show the detailed network architectures in Figure 6, and describe the details in the following.\nFCN+ has a similar structure as FCN [34]: it first applies a feature network to obtain a feature map on an image, then uses skip features to generate three segmentation maps of various down-sampling rates (8s, 16s and 32s), then fuses them together, and finally up-samples to the original image size for semantic segmentation. The only modification is that FCN+ applies our designed non-linear pixel classifier (instead of the linear pixel classifier in FCN) to generate a segmentation map from the input feature map.\nThe non-linear pixel classifier leverages non-linearity and dilated convolution to model pixel labeling. It consists of a dilated convolutional layer [40, 4] to aggregate contextual information, a ReLU layer for non-linearity, as well as a one-by-one convolutional layer to predict the segmentation map. In our experiments, we apply 3 by 3 convolutional kernels in the dilated convolutional layer, using a dilation rate of 2 under 512 channels.\nOur DilatedNet+ is derived from DilatedNet [4] with the same modification – we apply our non-linear pixel classifier on the feature map (obtained after dilated convolutions) to generate the segmentation map. We kept the rest of the structure the same as [4].\nWe show an empirical comparison between the original FCN/DilatedNet and our FCN+/DilatedNet+ in Table 6. For a fair comparison, we apply the same feature network, i.e., 16-layer VGGNet [36], for all methods. Our networks\nobtained slightly better performance than the original methods due to the usage of the non-linear pixel classifier.\nA.2. Two-Layer CNN in the DC Architecture\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2.2 and Figure 3, we use a two-layer CNN to infer the LabelBank representation from densely cropped image windows. The two-layer CNN is structured as follows. The first is a dilated convolutional layer. We use k×k convolutional kernels with a dilation rate of r under d channels. In our experiments, we empirically set the patch size as 224, k = 3, r = 2 and d = 512. We apply ReLU activation on its outputs for non-linearity. The second layer is a one-by-one convolutional layer to predict the current window’s LabelBank representation. We then max-pool the location-aware predictions to compose the final LabelBank representation for the image.\nA.3. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)\nWe apply the same MLP structure in our SPP, OHE and W2V architectures for LabelBank inference. It first employs a fully-connected layer to map the input vector to (2048) hidden units, then applies a ReLU activation function, and finally leverages another fully-connected layer to generate the output representation, i.e., the k-dimensional LabelBank.\nA.4. Feature Network\nWhen inferring the LabelBank from visual appearance, our SPP and DC architectures both employ a feature network (i.e., low-level layers of convolution and pooling) to extract a feature map on a given image. In our experiments, we empirically build the feature network from the 152-layer ResNet [14] by removing the top fully-connected layers and keeping the convolutional and pooling layers.\nAlso note that there is a feature network in our semantic segmentation process (i.e., FCN+ and DilatedNet+). In our experiments, we share the same feature network across LabelBank inference and semantic segmentation for computational efficiency and feature generalizability.\nWith the shared feature network, our framework looks similar to multi-task learning of classification and segmentation. However, we point out that the key to success lies\nin the LabelBank based holistic filtering. We provide empirical evidence to support this in Section E.1. Furthermore, we also conduct experiments in Section E.2 to show that our framework is flexible and can take various feature networks."

It has been shown that data augmentation is a practical technique to boost semantic segmentation performance. In our experiments, we have applied horizontal flipping as well as scale augmentation when training our networks.

We learn our model on the 20,210 training images, and report performance on the 2,000 validation images. We did not evaluate on its 5,000 test images as the ground-truth annotations are not publicly available.

      "heading" : "Appendix D. Additional Results",
      "text" : "Due to the space limit in our main paper, we defer our experimental results on SIFT-Flow and NYUDv2 here. These two datasets have no additional meta data beyond the image visual appearance. So here we compare our SPP + FCN+ and DC + FCN+ with the baseline FCN+ as well as stateof-the-art approaches. The details are described as follows.\nD.1. SIFT-Flow\nThe results are reported in Table 7, which shows that our methods perform the best over all the compared methods. Note that the current state-of-the-art FCN-8s [34] leverages the available pixel-wise geometric labels (i.e., horizontal, vertical and sky) as extra supervision, whereas our methods do not use them. These observations show the utility of our framework in semantic segmentation.\nIt is worth mentioning that a competitive method on the SIFT-Flow dataset is proposed by Lin et al. [25], achieving 88.1% pAcc, 53.4% mAcc and 44.9% mIU. However, this method up-samples training and testing images by a factor of two, and benefits from the high-resolution images to obtain superior performance. On the other hand, all the other methods including ours do not up-sample images, and thus are not directly comparable with [25].\nD.2. NYUDv2\nWe provide the evaluation results in Table 8. It is shown that our methods achieve the best performance, especially with DC + FCN+.\nOur methods only use the color images for training, ignoring the depth information. DC + FCN+ still improves 5.46% mIU over the state-of-the-art method, FCN-32s + RGB + HHA [34], which utilizes both the color and depth information. It again verifies the effectiveness of the proposed framework."

      "text" : "In this section, we conduct ablation studies on our feature network. First, in Section E.1, we compare our framework with multi-task learning that also uses a shared feature network. Second, in Section E.2, we evaluate the flexibility of our framework against various feature networks.\nE.1. Comparison with Multi-Task Learning\nIn our framework implementation, we share the feature network across the visual appearance based LabelBank inference and the semantic segmentation process. The resultant framework has a similar structure as multi-task learning of classification and segmentation. However, we emphasize that our performance gain mainly comes from the LabelBank based holistic filtering, not the generic features learned from the shared feature network. We conduct experiments to support this in the following.\nWe have evaluated a standard multi-task learning method, where we have a classification branch in parallel with a semantic segmentation branch, with a shared feature network but without LabelBank based holistic filtering. We instantiate the classification and segmentation branches with DC and FCN+, respectively. The results on PASCALContext are reported in Table 9, which shows no significant performance gain with the multi-task training over the baseline FCN+. In contrast, our DC + FCN+ outperforms Multi-Task FCN+ and FCN+ substantially. It validates the critical usage of our LabelBank based holistic filtering for semantic segmentation.\nIt is also interesting to note that Multi-Task FCN+ has exactly the same network capacity (i.e., number of parameters) as our DC + FCN+, but it performs worse than ours. It shows that increasing network capacity might not necessarily increase performance. Instead, it is our LabelBank based holistic filtering that boosts semantic segmentation.\nE.2. Feature Network Variants\nWe have also conducted experiments to study the flexibility of our framework in taking various feature networks. In detail, we have tried the 16-layer VGGNet [36] and the 152-layer ResNet [14] respectively as our feature network. We evaluate our methods (i.e., DC + FCN+ and DC + DilatedNet+) and our baselines (i.e., FCN+ and DilatedNet+) accordingly. The comparative results on the PASCAL-Context dataset are reported in Table 10.\nThe table clearly shows that our methods improve over the baselines, using either VGGNet or ResNet. It verifies that our framework is flexible and can adopt various feature networks to improve semantic segmentation. This flexibility enables our framework to take advantage of the continual improvement in CNN architectures. Furthermore, it is beneficial to use ResNet as our feature network as it consistently outperforms its VGGNet counterpart. This is reasonable since ResNet employs a deeper structure than VGGNet to capture rich image features."

The detailed setup is as follows.\nTo degrade the precision, we have added in np ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 10} noisy labels per image. Similarly, to degrade the recall, we have removed nr ∈ {1, 2, · · · , 10} groundtruth labels per image (if there are fewer than nr groundtruth labels in an image, we just remove them all). Note that np and nr can be set as fractional values to further refine the numerical accuracy of precision and recall. For example, setting nr = 2.3 means that we will first remove 2 (the integer part of nr) ground-truth labels on each image, and then randomly pick up 30% (the decimal part of nr) of the images to remove one more ground-truth label each. With this trick, we also tried nr ∈ {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8} in our experiment. We conduct holistic filtering for semantic segmentation with an exhaustive grid search of np and nr values. Note that each combination of np and nr produces\nLabelBank with certain precision and recall of ground-truth labels (by averaging over all images). The mean IU grid is plotted in Figure 6."

    "abstractText" : "Semantic segmentation requires a detailed labeling of image pixels by object category. Information derived from local image patches is necessary to describe the detailed shape of individual objects. However, this information is ambiguous and can result in noisy labels. Global inference of image content can instead capture the general semantic concepts present. We advocate that holistic inference of image concepts provides valuable information for detailed pixel labeling. We propose a generic framework to leverage holistic information in the form of a LabelBank for pixellevel segmentation. We show the ability of our framework to improve semantic segmentation performance in a variety of settings. We learn models for extracting a holistic LabelBank from visual cues, attributes, and/or textual descriptions. We demonstrate improvements in semantic segmentation accuracy on standard datasets across a range of state-of-the-art segmentation architectures and holistic inference approaches.",
