      "text" : "Deep neural networks provide a powerful mechanism for learning patterns from massive data, achieving new levels of performance on image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012), machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014), playing strategic board games (Silver et al., 2016), and so forth.\nDespite the impressive advances, the widely-used DNN methods still have limitations. The high predictive accuracy has heavily relied on large amounts of labeled data; and the purely data-driven learning can lead to uninterpretable and sometimes counter-intuitive results (Szegedy et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2015). It is also difficult to encode human intention to guide the models to capture desired patterns, without expensive direct supervision or ad-hoc initialization.\nOn the other hand, the cognitive process of human beings have indicated that people learn not only from concrete examples (as DNNs do) but also from different forms of general knowledge and rich experiences (Minksy, 1980; Lake et al., 2015). Logic rules provide a flexible declarative language for communicating high-level cognition and expressing structured knowledge. It is therefore desirable to integrate logic rules into DNNs, to transfer human intention and domain knowledge to neural models, and regulate the learning process.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 31\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n1 M\nIn this paper, we present a framework capable of enhancing general types of neural networks, such as convolutional networks (CNNs) and recurrent networks (RNNs), on various tasks, with logic rule knowledge. Combining symbolic representations with neural methods have been considered in different contexts. Neural-symbolic systems (Garcez et al., 2012) construct a network from a given rule set to execute reasoning. To exploit a priori knowledge in general neural architectures, recent work augments each raw data instance with useful features (Collobert et al., 2011), while network training, however, is still limited to instance-label supervision and suffers from the same issues mentioned above. Besides, a large variety of structural knowledge cannot be naturally encoded in the feature-label form.\nOur framework enables a neural network to learn simultaneously from labeled instances as well as logic rules, through an iterative rule knowledge distillation procedure that transfers the structured information encoded in the logic rules into the network parameters. Since the general logic rules are complementary to the specific data labels, a natural “side-product” of the integration is the support for semi-supervised learning where unlabeled data can be used to better absorb the logical knowledge. Methodologically, our approach can be seen as a combination of the knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Bucilu et al., 2006) and the posterior regularization (PR) method (Ganchev et al., 2010). In particular, at each iteration we adapt the posterior constraint principle from PR to construct a rule-regularized teacher, and train the student network of interest to imitate the predictions of the teacher network. We leverage soft logic to support flexible rule encoding.\nWe apply the proposed framework on both CNN and RNN, and deploy on the task of sentiment analysis (SA) and named entity recognition (NER), respectively. With only a few (one or two) very intuitive rules, the enhanced networks strongly improve over their basic forms (without rules), and achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-theart models which typically have more parameters and complicated architectures.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate logic rules with the general workhorse types of deep neural networks in a principled framework. The encouraging results indicate that our method can be potentially useful for other NLP tasks and application domains, as well as incorporating richer types of human knowledge."

      "text" : "Given the intuitive value of combining logic rules and neural networks, various distinct forms of such combination have been considered in different contexts. Neural-symbolic systems (Garcez et al., 2012), such as KBANN (Towell et al., 1990) and CILP++ (França et al., 2014), construct network architectures from given rules to perform reasoning and knowledge acquisition. A related line of research, such as Markov logic networks (Richardson and Domingos, 2006), derives probabilistic graphical models (rather than neural networks) from the rule set.\nWith the recent success of deep neural networks in a vast variety of application domains, it is increasingly desirable to incorporate structured logic knowledge into general types of networks to harness flexibility and reduce unpredictability. Recent work that trains on extra\nfeatures from domain knowledge (Collobert et al., 2011), while producing improved results, does not go beyond the data-label paradigm. Kulkarni et al. (2015) uses a specialized training procedure with careful ordering of training instances to obtain an interpretable neural layer of an image network. Though there do exist general frameworks that allow encoding structured constraints on latent variable models (Ganchev et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2014; Liang et al., 2009), they either are not directly applicable to the NN case, or could yield inferior performance as in our empirical study.\nOur proposed approach is distinct in that we use an iterative rule distillation process to effectively transfer rich structured knowledge, expressed in the declarative first-order logic language, into parameters of general neural networks. We show that the proposed approach strongly outperforms an extensive array of other either ad-hoc or general integration methods."

This is achieved by forcing the network to emulate the predictions of a rule-regularized teacher, and evolving both models iteratively throughout training (section 3.2). The process is agnostic to the network architecture, and thus applicable to general types of neural models including CNNs and RNNs. We construct the teacher network in each iteration by adapting the posterior regularization principle in our logical constraint setting (section 3.3), where our formulation provides a closed-form solution. Figure 1 shows an overview of the proposed framework."

      "heading" : "3.1 Learning Resources: Instances and Rules",
      "text" : "Our approach allows neural networks to learn from both specific examples and general rules. Here we give the settings of these “learning resources”.\nAssume we have input variable x ∈ X and target variable y ∈ Y. For clarity, we focus on K-way classification, where Y = ∆K is the K-dimensional probability simplex and y ∈ {0, 1}K ⊂ Y is a one-hot encoding of the class label. However, our method specification can straightforwardly be applied to other contexts such as regression and sequence learning (e.g., NER tagging, which is typically a sequence of classification decisions). The training data D = {(xn,yn)}Nn=1 is a set of instantiations of (x,y).\nFurther consider a set of first-order logic (FOL) rules with confidences R = {(Rl, λl)}Ll=1, where Rl is the lth rule over the above input-target space (X ,Y), and λl ∈ [0,∞] is the confidence level with λl = ∞ indicating a hard rule, i.e., all groundings are required to be true (=1). Given a set of examples (X,Y) ⊂ (X ,Y) (e.g., a minibatch from D), the set of groundings of Rl are denoted as {rlg(X,Y)}Glg=1. In practice a rule grounding is typically relevant to only a single or subset of examples, though here we give the most general form on the entire set.\nWe encode the FOL rules using soft logic (Bach et al., 2015) for flexible encoding and stable optimization. Specifically, soft logic allows continuous truth values from the interval [0, 1] instead of {0, 1}, and the Boolean logic operators are reformulated as:\nA&B = max{A+B − 1, 0} A ∨B = min{A+B, 1} ¬A = 1−A\n(1)"

      "heading" : "3.2 Rule Knowledge Distillation",
      "text" : "A neural network defines a conditional probability pθ(y|x) by using a softmax output layer that produces a K-dimensional soft prediction vector denoted as σθ(x). The network is parameterized by weights θ. Previous neural network training has been to iteratively update θ to produce the correct labels of training instances. To integrate the information encoded in the rules, we propose to train the network to also imitate the outputs of a rule-regularized projection of pθ(y|x), denoted as q(y|x), which explicitly includes rule constraints as regularization terms. In each iteration q is constructed by projecting pθ into a subspace constrained by the rules, and thus has desirable properties. We present the construction in the next section. The prediction behavior of q reveals the information of the regularized subspace and structured rules. Emulating the q outputs serves to transfer this knowledge into pθ. The new objective is then formulated as a balancing between imitating the soft predictions of q and predicting the true hard labels:\nθ(t+1) = arg min θ∈Θ\n1\nN N∑ n=1 (1− π)`(yn,σθ(t)(xn))\n+ π`(s(t)n ,σθ(t)(xn)),\n(2)\nwhere ` denotes the loss function selected according to specific applications (e.g., typically the cross entropy loss for classification); s (t) n is the soft prediction vector of q on xn at iteration t; and π is the imitation parameter calibrating the relative importance of the two objectives.\nA similar imitation procedure has been used in other settings such as model compression (Bucilu et al., 2006; Hinton et al., 2015) where the process is termed distillation. Following them we call pθ(y|x) the “student” and q(y|x) the “teacher”, which can be intuitively explained in analogous to human education where a teacher is aware of systematic general rules and she instructs students by providing her solutions to particular questions (i.e., the soft predictions). Another noticeable difference from previous distillation work, where teacher is obtained beforehand and student is trained thereafter, is that our teacher and student are learned simultaneously during training.\nThough it is possible to combine a network with rule constraints by projecting the network to the rule-regularized subspace after it is fully trained as before with only data-label instances, or by optimizing projected network directly, we found our iterative teacher-student distillation approach provides a much superior performance, as shown in the experiments. Moreover, since pθ distills the rule information into the weights θ instead of relying on explicit rule representations, we can use pθ for predicting new examples at test time when the rule assessment is expensive or even unavailable (i.e., the privileged information setting (Lopez-Paz et al., 2016)) while still enjoying the benefit of integration. Besides, the second loss term in Eq.(2) can be augmented with rich unlabeled data in addition to the labeled examples, which enables semi-supervised learning for better absorbing the rule knowledge."

      "text" : "We now proceed to construct the teacher network q(y|x) at each iteration from pθ(y|x). The iteration index t is omitted for clarity. We adapt the posterior regularization principle in our logic constraint setting. Our formulation ensures a closed-form solution for q and thus avoids any significant increases in computational overhead.\nRecall the set of FOL rules R = {(Rl, λl)}Ll=1. Our goal is to find the optimal q that fits the rules while at the same time staying close to pθ. For the first property, we apply a commonlyused strategy that imposes the rule constraints on q through an expectation operator. That is, for each grounding (indexed by g) of each rule (indexed by l) on (X,Y), we expect Eq(Y|X)[rlg(X,Y)] = 1 (with confidence λl). The constraints define a rule-regularized space of all valid distributions. For the second property, we measure the closeness between q and pθ with KL-divergence, and wish to minimize it. Combining the two factors together and further allowing slackness for the constraints, we finally get the following optimization\nproblem:\nmin q,ξ≥0 KL(q(Y|X)‖pθ(Y|X)) + C ∑ l,gl ξl,gl\ns.t. λl(1− Eq[rl,gl(X,Y)]) ≤ ξl,gl gl = 1, . . . , Gl, l = 1, . . . , L,\n(3)\nwhere ξl,gl ≥ 0 is the slack variable for respective logic constraint; and C is the regularization parameter. The problem can be seen as projecting pθ into the constrained subspace. The problem is convex and can be efficiently solved in its dual form with closed-form solutions. We provide the detailed derivation in the supplementary materials and directly give the solution here:\nq∗(Y|X) ∝ pθ(Y|X) exp −∑ l,gl Cλl(1− rl,gl(X,Y))  . (4) Intuitively, a strong rule with large λl will lead to low probabilities of predictions that fail to meet the constraints.\nOur framework is related to the posterior regularization (PR) method (Ganchev et al., 2010) which places constraints over model posterior in unsupervised setting. In classification, our optimization procedure is analogous to the modified EM algorithm for PR, by using crossentropy loss in Eq.(2) and evaluating the second loss term on unlabeled data differing from D, so that Eq.(4) corresponds to the E-step and Eq.(2) is analogous to the M-step. This sheds light from another perspective on why our framework would work. However, we found in our experiments (section 5) that to produce strong performance it is crucial to use the same labeled data in the two losses of Eq.(2) so as to form a trade-off between imitating soft predictions and predicting correct hard labels.\nInference and Implementation The procedure of iterative distilling optimization of our framework is summarized in Algorithm 1. During training we need to compute the soft predictions of q at each iteration, which is straightforward if the rule constraints in Eq.(4) are factored in the same way as the base neural model pθ. If the constraints introduce additional dependencies, e.g., bi-gram dependency as the transition rule in the NER task (section 4.2), we can use dynamic programming for efficient computation; for higher-order constraints (e.g., the listing rule in NER), we approximate using Gibbs sampling that iteratively samples from q(yi|y−i,x) for each position i. If the constraints span multiple instances, we group the relevant instances in minibatches for joint inference (and randomly break some dependencies when a group is too large).\nAt test time we can use either the distilled student network pθ, or the teacher network q after a final projection. Our empirical results show that both models substantially improve over the base network (trained using only data-label instances), while in general q performs better than pθ. Besides, q is more suitable when the logic rules are over multiple examples, requiring joint inference. In contrast, as mentioned above, pθ is useful when rule evaluation is expensive or impossible at prediction time.\nAlgorithm 1 Harnessing NN with Rules Input: The training data D = {(xn,yn)}Nn=1, The rule set R = {(Rl, λl)}Ll=1, Parameters: π – imitation parameter C – regularization strength 1: Initialize neural network parameter θ 2: repeat 3: Sample a minibatch (X,Y) ⊂ D 4: Construct teacher network q with Eq.(4) 5: Distill knowledge into pθ by updating θ with Eq.(2) 6: until convergence Output: Distilled student network pθ and teacher network q"

The task is crucial for many opinion mining applications. One challenging point of the task is to capture the contrastive sense (e.g., by conjunction “but”) within a sentence.\nBase Network We use the single-channel convolutional network proposed in (Kim, 2014). The simple model has achieved compelling performance on various sentiment classification benchmarks. The network contains a convolutional layer on top of word vectors of a given sentence, followed by a max-over-time pooling layer and then a fully-connected layer with softmax output activation. A convolution operation is to apply a filter to word windows. Multiple filters with varying window sizes are used to obtain multiple features. Figure 2, left panel, shows the network architecture.\nLogic Rules One difficulty for the plain neural network is to identify contrastive sense in order to capture the dominant sentiment precisely. Conjunction “but” is one of the strong\nindicators for such sentiment changes in a sentence, where the sentiment of clauses following “but” generally dominates. We thus consider sentences S with an “A-but-B” structure, and expect the sentiment of the whole sentence to be consistent with the sentiment of clause B. The logic rule is written as:\nhas-‘A-but-B’-structure(S)⇒ ‖σθ(S)− σθ(B)‖2, (5)\nwhere we use the `2 distance between the softmax outputs as a measure for the closeness of the sentiment predictions of S and B.

      "text" : "NER is to locate and classify elements in text into entity categories such as “persons” and “organizations”. It is an essential first step for downstream language understanding applications. The task assigns to each word a named entity tag in an “X-Y” format where X is one of BIEOS (Beginning, Inside, End, Outside, and Singleton) and Y is the entity category. A valid tag sequence has to follow certain constraints by the definition of the tagging scheme. Besides, text with structures (e.g., lists) within or across sentences can usually expose some consistency patterns.\nBase Network The base network has a similar architecture with the bi-directional LSTM recurrent network (called BLSTM-CNN) proposed in (Chiu and Nichols, 2015) for NER which has outperformed most of previous neural models. The model uses a CNN and pretrained word vectors to capture character- and word-level information, respectively. These features are then fed into a bi-directional RNN with LSTM units for sequence tagging. Compared to (Chiu and Nichols, 2015) we omit the character type and capitalization features, as well as the additive transition matrix in the output layer. Figure 2, right panel, shows the network architecture.\nLogic Rules The base network largely makes independent tagging decisions at each position, ignoring the constraints on successive labels for a valid tag sequence (e.g., I-ORG cannot follow B-PER). In contrast to recent work (Lample et al., 2016) which adds a conditional random field (CRF) to capture bi-gram dependencies between outputs, we instead apply logic rules which does not introduce extra parameters to learn. An example rule is:\nEqual(yi−1, I-ORG)⇒ ¬ Equal(yi,B-PER) (6)\nThe confidence levels are set to ∞ to prevent any violation.\nWe further leverage the list structures within and across sentences of the same documents. Specifically, named entities at corresponding positions in a list are likely to be in the same categories. For instance, in “1. Juventus, 2. Barcelona, 3. ...” we know “Barcelona” must be an organization rather than a location, since its counterpart entity “Juventus” is an organization. We describe our simple procedure for identifying lists and counterparts in the supplementary materials. The logic rule is encoded as:\nis-counterpart(A,B) = ‖c(σθ(A))− c(σθ(B))‖2, (7)\nwhere c collapses the probability mass on the labels with the same categories into a single probability, yielding a vector with length equaling to the number of categories. The list rule can span multiple sentences (within the same document), thus we use q at test time for joint prediction."

Rows 3-10 show the accuracy of recent top-performing methods. On the MR and CR datasets, our model achieves the state-of-theart performance. On SST2, MVCNN (Yin and Schutze, 2015) (Row 4) is the only system that shows a slightly better result than ours. Their neural network has combined diverse\nversions of pre-trained word embeddings (while we use only word2vec) and has contained more neural layers and parameters than our model.\nTo further investigate the effectiveness of our framework in integrating structured rule knowledge, we compare with an extensive array of other possible integration approaches. Table 2 lists these methods and their performance on the SST2 sentiment classification task. We see that: 1) Although all methods lead to different degrees of improvement, our framework outperforms all other competitors with a large margin. 2) The distilled student network “-Rule-p” achieves much superior accuracy compared to the base CNN, as well as “-project” and “-opt-project” which explicitly project the CNN model to the ruleconstrained subspace. We have observed similar results on the MR and CR datasets—the student network achieves an accuracy of 81.59% and 85.22% on MR and CR, respectively, greatly improving over the base CNN as shown in Row 1 Table 1. This validates that our knowledge distillation procedure (section 3.2) can indeed transfer the structured knowledge into the neural parameters effectively. 3) The teacher network “-Rule-q” further improves over the student network “-Rule-p”, though the student network is more widely applicable in certain contexts as discussed in section 3.2.\nWe next explore the performance of our framework with varying numbers of labeled instances as well as the effect of exploiting unlabeled data. Intuitively, with less labeled examples we expect the general rules would contribute more to the performance, and unlabeled data should help better learn from the rules. This can be a useful property especially when data are sparse and labels are expensive to obtain. Table 3 shows the results. The subsampling is conducted on the sentence level. That is, for instance, in “5%” we first selected 5% training sentences uniformly at random, then trained the models on these sentences as well as their phrases. The results verify our expectations. 1) Rows 1-3 give the accuracy of only using data-label subsets for training. In every setting our methods consistently outperform the base CNN. 2) “-Rule-q” provides higher improvement on 5% data\n(with margin 2.6%) than on larger data (e.g., 2.3% on 10% data, and 2.0% on 30% data), showing promising potential in the sparse data context. 3) By adding unlabeled instances for semi-supervised learning, we get further improved accuracy. 4) “-semi-PR” is the posterior regularization (Ganchev et al., 2010) which imposes the rule constraint only through unlabeled data during training. Our iterative distillation framework consistently provides substantially better results."

In particular, we only retrieve lists that with the pattern “1. ... 2. ... 3. ...” (i.e., indexed by numbers), and “- ... - ... - ...” (i.e., each item marked with “-”). We require at least 3 items to form a list.\nWe further require the text of each item follows certain patterns to ensure the text is highly likely to be named entities, and rule out those lists whose item text is largely free text. Specifically, we require 1) all words of the item text all start with capital letters; 2) referring the text between punctuations as “block”, each block includes no more than 3 words.\nWe detect both intra-sentence lists and inter-sentence lists in documents. We found the above patterns are effective to identify true lists. A better list detection method is expected to further improve our NER results."

Specifically, we develop an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of logic rules into the weights of neural networks. We deploy the framework on a CNN for sentiment analysis, and an RNN for named entity recognition. With a few highly intuitive rules, we obtain substantial improvements and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results to previous best-performing systems.",
