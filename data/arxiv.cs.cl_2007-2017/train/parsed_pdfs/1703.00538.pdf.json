      "text" : "Greater patient involvement has the potential to improve patient-centered care to build better and safer health services. In a nationwide effort to achieve this goal [1– 3], online patient portals have been widely adopted by health systems in the U.S. [3,4]. Patient portals give patients secure access to their personal health information, including structured information from EHRs (e.g., laboratory test results and medication lists). In addition, the OpenNotes initiative [5] and the Blue Button movement [6] allow patients to access their full EHR notes through the portals, with early evidence showing improved medical comprehension, healthcare management, and outcomes [7–9]. However, patients may face great challenges when reading full EHR notes due to the lack of medical training, which would compromise the benefits gleaned from this approach. Since EHR notes are written by physicians for the purpose of record keeping and communication among healthcare providers, they are typically long and contain abundant medical jargon difficult for average people. Previous studies showed that EHRs were written at an 8th-12th grade reading level [10–13], which is above the average adult patient’s reading level of 7th to 8th grade in the U.S. [14–18]. In addition, 36% adult Americans have limited health literacy [19]. Limited health literacy has been identified as one of the major barriers to patient portal use (which includes interpreting information from EHRs) [20–22]. One way to help patients to comprehend their EHR notes is to reduce information overload and help them first understand medical terms that matter most to them. This approach is motivated by two reasons. First, medical terms have been shown to be obstacles for patients [23–28]. Second, EHR notes incorporate a comprehensive description of patients’ medical courses, part of which (e.g., technical details about surgery procedures or echocardiogram results) may not directly address patients’ immediate concerns. The approach of explaining all the jargon in their notes at once may likely overwhelm the patients and may be unnecessary in the first place. Therefore, we help patients focus on EHR terms most important to them.\nPersonalized interventions can then be developed to support patient EHR comprehension. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from a typical EHR note from our evaluation data which was annotated by physicians. Although there are many medical terms in this piece of text (here we only highlighted a subset of terms identified by MetaMap [29] for illustration purpose), physicians identified only five terms most important for patients to know, i.e., “pancreatic neoplasm”, “Whipple procedure”, “pancreatectomy”, “splenectomy”, and “insulin-dependent diabetic”. Note that physicians do not mark many unfamiliar medical terms, e.g., “Tinnitus”, “CA 19-9”, and “bile duct stricture”, suggesting that they do not rank terms based on their difficulty levels.\nThe goal of this work is to develop FIT, a robust unsupervised NLP system, to automate the process of identifying EHR(patient)-specific important terms. This task is challenging because FIT does not use supervision from labeled data. In addition, existing unsupervised methods based on general principles of term importance (such as term frequency and topic coherence) are not sufficient to solve this problem (details in the Discussion section). We address this challenge by proposing a new unsupervised ensemble ranking method which adapts the biased\nrandom walk algorithm for information fusion to integrate evidences of term importance from heterogeneous information resources. Our work is an important step towards building generalizable NLP systems to facilitate personalized interventions to improve patient EHR comprehension. Our contributions are multi-folds. Firstly, we developed FIT, a state-of-the-art unsupervised NLP system for ranking and identifying EHR terms important to patients. Secondly, we explored novel domain adaptation techniques and features, including developing a patient vocabulary model using distant supervision. Thirdly, we developed a new ensemble ranking model as the core of FIT and empirically showed that it was robust and flexible in fusing information from multiple resources. These properties, along with the model’s unsupervised nature, ease FIT’s extension to other domains and applications (e.g., document retrieval and opinion extraction). FIT’s output can also be used by other NLP applications, including summarization and question answering."

On the issue of determining which medical terms to simplify, previous work explored frequency-based and/or context-based approaches to check if a term is unfamiliar to the average patients or if it has simpler synonyms [11,30,31]. Such work targets medical jargon and treats all the jargon terms equally important. Our approach is different because it targets important medical terms (which are not equivalent to medical jargon, as discussed in the Introduction section) and is patient-centered (i.e., it finds important terms for each EHR note of individual patients). It is worth noting that our approach is complementary to previous work. For example, in a real-world application, we can display the lay definitions for all the medical jargon in a patient’s EHR note, and then highlight those terms which FIT predicts to be most important to this patient."

      "text" : "Our work is related to but different from single-document keyphrase extraction (KE), the goal of which is to identify terms representing important concepts and topics in a document. KE targets topics which the writers wanted to convey when\nwriting the documents. Our problem is more challenging because physicians wrote EHR notes for physician-physician communication and, therefore, features extracted from EHR notes may not be sufficient to guide an automated system to find topics and terms important to patients. Previous work in unsupervised KE has explored various techniques, including language modeling, topic-clustering, graph-based ranking and simultaneous learning of keyphrases and key sentences [33]. Among them, graph-based methods such as TextRank [34] and its variations are the state-of-the-arts [33]. We adapted SingleRank [35] (an extension of TextRank) to clinical domain and used it as a baseline as well as an input for the ensemble ranking approaches. KE in the biomedical domain has been limitedly explored in literature articles and in using domain-specific methods and features [36–39]. For example, Li et al. [36] developed KIP to extract keyphrases from medical articles. KIP used MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) as the knowledge base to compute a score to reflect a phrase’s domain specificity. It assigned each candidate phrase a rank score by multiplying its within-document term frequency and domain-specificity score. Different from the aforementioned approaches, we used unsupervised ensemble ranking to combine multiple information resources for the ranking.\nFigure 2. Overview of FIT and its evaluation."

      "text" : "In this view, we consider medical terms frequently used by patients to be important to patients (w.r.t. patient centeredness). One way to quantify terms used by patients is to collect and analyze patients’ queries on the internet.\nThe consumer health vocabulary (CHV) is collection of terms used by patients. It is a rich resource that incorporates terms extracted from various consumer health sites, such as queries submitted to MedLinePlus and postings in health-focused online discussion forums [40–46]. It contains 152,338 terms, most of which are consumer health terms [44–46]. Zeng et al. [45] mapped these consumer health terms to the UMLS concepts by a semi-automatic approach. As the result of this work, the CHV encompasses lay terms as well as corresponding medical terms. Although the CHV is a comprehensive patient-centered resource, its coverage is limited. Therefore, we used the CHV to develop a distant-supervision vocabulary model to rank the patient-centeredness of a medical term. Our model made an assumption that medical terms that occur in both EHRs and the CHV are important to patients for comprehending their EHRs because they are medical synonyms of terms initially used by patients to query online health forums. We built the model on support vector machines (SVMs). The training examples include 37,732 terms identified from 6K EHR notes by MetaMap. We followed [30] (i.e., CHV familiarity score ≤ 0.6) to identify 9,994 medical terms that occur in both the CHV and these EHR terms, which we labeled as positive examples. The remaining 27,738 terms were labeled as negative. We used word embeddings as learning features because word embedding has emerged as a powerful technique for word representation and has been successfully used in biomedical and clinical NLP tasks such as biomedical named entity recognition [47,48], adverse drug event detection [49,50], ranking biomedical synonyms [51], and disambiguating clinical abbreviations [52,53]. We trained a neural language model to learn word embeddings by using the Word2Vec software [54,55]. We trained Word2Vec on a combined text corpus (over 3G words) of English Wikipedia, articles from PubMed Open Access and 99K EHR notes from the Pittsburg corpus1. We set the training parameters based on the study of Pyysalo et al. [56]. We represented multi-word terms with the mean of individual word vectors. In this work, we used 200-dimension word vectors, with each dimension normalized to [0,1]. We used the RBF-kernel SVM algorithm implemented by LibSVM [57] to learn feature weights and used LibSVM’s probabilistic outputs [58,59] to rank candidate terms in each EHR note."

We used CHV familiarity scores to distinguish between unfamiliar terms and familiar terms. The CHV assigns familiarity scores to 58% (88,189 out of 152,338) of its terms for extended usability. CHV familiarity scores estimate the likelihood that a medical term can be understood by an average reader [63] and take values between 0 and 1 (with 1 being most familiar and 0 being least familiar). The CHV provides different types of familiarity scores [30]. Following [30], we used the combined score and a score threshold 0.6 to detect unfamiliar and familiar terms (familiarity score ≤0.6 are unfamiliar terms; >0.6 are familiar terms). Since not every EHR term has a CHV familiarity score, the available information about term unfamiliarity is partial. Note that our approach is different from ranking terms by term familiarity scores for two reasons: (1) we only use two familiarity levels; and (2) the most unfamiliar terms (with the lowest familiarity score in the CHV) are not necessarily the most important terms."

We used a heuristic, i.e., frequency > 1,000, to select 12 CHV-preferred semantic types (see Appendix A).

As described previously, we have collected information from multiple resources which represent term importance from different perspectives. However, we do not know which perspective is more relevant to the patient perspective. Since these information resources are complimentary to each other, an ensemble model that utilizes all of them is expected to be more robust than any model that uses only a single resource. We used unsupervised ensemble learning and built FIT on an adapted random walk algorithm derived from PageRank [61]. The adaption is to allow transition from term \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC57 to term \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56 during random walk if and only if term \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC57 is ranked lower than term \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56 based on comprehensive information from all available resources (i.e., single rankers).

We estimated r(t) for this ranker by using all candidate terms that have familiarity scores. Our random walk algorithm estimates the importance of each term by counting the support from its neighboring terms (i.e., any term that has an edge pointing to this term) recursively. Neighbors of higher importance and with higher probabilities to reach a term contribute more to the term’s importance. Mathematically, we used the same equation as defined in (2) to update the importance score of each term, where the word \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56 (\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57) is replaced by the term \uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56 (\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC57).\nThe aforementioned algorithm uses only rank orders.

We asked physicians to do the annotation because this task requires a full comprehension of EHR notes which is beyond the capacity of the average patients [11–13,30]. We developed an annotation guideline (see Appendix B) to instruct physicians to annotate the notes from the patient perspective. For each note, we obtained annotations from two physicians and used the agreement from both physicians as the gold-standard. The annotation agreement (micro average) on the 90 notes is 0.51 Cohen’s Kappa. In total, the physicians have identified 793 important medical terms (9±5 terms per note), which covers a wide range of topics including disease, syndrome, medication, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

These metrics measure system performances for top ranks and are widely used to evaluate KE systems. We computed these metrics by using all the gold-standard important terms (including those that would never be included in the stage of candidate term extraction) as positive examples. Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): AUC-ROC is a metrics widely used for evaluating ranking outputs. It computes the area under a ROC curve, which plots the true positive rate (y-coordinate) against the false positive rate (x-coordinate) at various threshold settings. When evaluating a system, we compute its AUC-ROC for each EHR note in the evaluation set and report the averaged value. AUC-ROC measures the performance of the global ranking. Because both candidate term extraction and ranking affect the quality of global ranking, we report two AUC-ROC metrics: AUCROCranking and AUC-ROCKE. AUC-ROCranking is computed on the candidate terms extracted by a system. Thereby, if a gold-standard important term is missed in candidate term extraction, it will not affect the system’s AUC-ROCranking. AUC-ROCKE is computed by using all the gold-standard important terms as positive examples and measures the combined performance of candidate term extraction and ranking.\nIn evaluation, we use relaxed string match to determine true positives as exact match is known to underestimate performance as perceived by human judges [73]. Specifically, we treat a term from the system output as a true positive if it either exactly matches or subsumes (e.g., “non-Hodgkin lymphoma” subsumes “lymphoma”) a gold-standard important term. We allow “subsume” but not “part-of” match in relaxed string match, as previous work found that the former aligned well with human judges but the latter did not [74]. For example, a part of an important term may be too general to be important, e.g., \"disease\" in \"Crohn's disease\" and \"iron\" in \"iron deficiency\"."

      "text" : "Automated ranking of EHR terms based on their importance to patients is challenging because EHR notes contain abundant medical terms, among which only a small portion (4% in our case) were judged to be important by physicians. Unsupervised ranking of EHR terms is even more challenging for two reasons. First, the ranker has no supervision from annotated data. Second, and probably most important, many factors affect the importance of a term. As a result, no single criterion or type of information is sufficient to achieve adequate results in ranking candidate terms (see Rows 2-4 in Table 2). Our system FIT overcomes this problem by integrating multiple complimentary information resources. It achieves 0.885 AUC-ROC in ranking candidate terms and 0.813 AUC-ROC when counting errors from candidate term identification. This performance level is adequate, especially for unsupervised systems."
    }, {
      "heading" : "6.2 FIT vs. Single Rankers",
      "text" : "Unsupervised ensemble ranking methods typically assume that the inputs from the single rankers are reasonably good and are sufficiently different and complimentary\nto each other [65,68]. When this assumption is violated, an ensemble ranker is not guaranteed to outperform the (best) single rankers [66,68,70,75]. Our results (Table 2) show that FIT works well and outperforms each single ranker significantly for all the metrics, suggesting that our design of FIT and selection of single rankers are appropriate and effective. Among the four single rankers, Topic Coherence performs best (Row 5 in Table 2). Topic modeling has been used to extend SingleRank to improve the state-of-the-arts in unsupervised KE [76,77]. Our results suggest that Topic Coherence, as a standalone ranker, can provide good-quality input for ensemble ranking for NLP tasks similar to KE. SingleRank is among the state-of-the-arts and TF*IDF is frequently used as a strong baseline in unsupervised KE from scientific literature and news [33]. Both models heavily rely on word/term frequency. However, in our data, 56% important medical terms occur only once in any individual EHR note, which partially explains why the two methods are less effective for EHRs. Unlike other single rankers, Patient Vocabulary Model was introduced specifically to incorporate domain(task)-specific knowledge into FIT. Our results show that its performance (Row 2 in Table 2) is comparable to other single rankers and is the second best on the AUC-ROC scores. In addition, as shown in Table 4 (Row 2 vs. Row 1), adding this model on a generic FIT system (FIT-generic) that uses only general information about term importance improves performance for all metrics. These results verify the validity of our assumption behind this model, i.e., medical terms that occur in both EHRs and the CHV are important to patients for comprehending their EHRs."

      "heading" : "6.3 FIT vs. Baseline Ensemble Rankers",
      "text" : "CondorcetFuse, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, and CombSum respectively use pairwise rank order relations, rank orders, and rank scores for ensemble ranking. Previous work shows that the performances of the three methods vary for different tasks and datasets and, therefore, there is no a guaranteed winner [66,68,67,69,70,75]. Furthermore, in real-world tasks, it is likely that we have only certain types of information (e.g., pairwise rank order relations from product review) or have information from heterogeneous resources (e.g., in our case). Therefore, it is desired to have a robust ensemble ranker that can utilize different information resources flexibly. FIT, by its design and as confirmed by our experiments, has the desired properties. For example, as shown in Table 4, FIT not only can use the complete information about rank scores and orders given by Patient Vocabulary Model to improve its performance (Row 2 vs. Row 1), but also can use the partial information about rank orders inferred from term unfamiliarity (Row 3 vs. Row 1). In addition, FIT’s\nperformance is relatively stable at different d values (Figure 4), confirming its robustness. These properties make FIT easily generalizable to new domains and other ranking problems."

First, we used relaxed string match for evaluation but did not allow “part-of” match (for the reason discussed in section 4.3). However, in some cases, this approach underestimates the performance. For example, FIT counted it as a mistake if MetaMap recognized “invasive” and “carcinoma of the colon cancer” but not “invasive carcinoma of the colon cancer”, the gold-standard term. Second, FIT depends on MetaMap, which makes mistakes. It failed to identify certain abbreviations as medical terms, e.g., A1c (a lab test for blood glucose), MRCP (Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), CPPD (calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease), and TSH (a lab test for thyroid stimulating hormone). In future work, we may collect a list of common clinical abbreviations by mining a large EHR corpus and uses this list to enhance medical term identification. Third, physicians sometimes judged common disease names (e.g., “hypertension”, “diabetes”, and “coronary artery disease”) as important when they are the major diagnoses of a patient. These terms were frequently missed from FIT’s top-10 because they were ranked low by TF*IDF (due to their high document frequencies) and the patient vocabulary model (which was trained to rank unfamiliar terms in both EHRs and the CHV high)."

    "abstractText" : "Background: Allowing patients to access their own electronic health record (EHR) notes through online patient portals has the potential to improve patient-centered care. However, EHR notes contain abundant medical jargon that can be difficult for patients to comprehend. One way to help patients is to reduce information overload and help them focus on medical terms that matter most to them. Targeted education can then be developed to improve patient EHR comprehension and the quality of care. Objective: The aim of this work was to develop FIT (Finding Important Terms for patients), an unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) system that ranks medical terms in EHR notes based on their importance to patients. Methods: We built FIT on a new unsupervised ensemble ranking model derived from the biased random walk algorithm to combine heterogeneous information resources for ranking candidate terms from each EHR note. Specifically, FIT integrates four single views (rankers) for term importance: patient use of medical concepts, document-level term salience, word-occurrence based term relatedness, and topic coherence. It also incorporates partial information of term importance as conveyed by terms’ unfamiliarity levels and semantic types. We evaluated FIT on 90 expert-annotated EHR notes and used the four single-view rankers as baselines. In addition, we implemented three benchmark unsupervised ensemble ranking methods as strong baselines. Results: FIT achieved 0.885 AUC-ROC for ranking candidate terms from EHR notes to identify important terms. When including term identification, the performance of FIT for identifying important terms from EHR notes was 0.813 AUC-ROC. Both performance scores significantly exceeded the corresponding scores from the four single rankers (P<.001). FIT also outperformed the three ensemble rankers for most metrics. Its performance is relatively insensitive to its parameter. Conclusions: FIT can automatically identify EHR terms important to patients. It may help develop future interventions to improve quality of care. By using unsupervised learning as well as a robust and flexible framework for information fusion, FIT can be readily applied to other domains and applications.",
