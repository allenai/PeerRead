      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe advent of large datasets and sophisticated machine learning models, commonly referred to as deep learning, has in recent years created a trend away from hand-crafted solutions towards more data-driven ones. Learning techniques have shown significant improvements in robustness and performance [1], particularly in the computer vision field. Traditionally robotic reaching approaches have been based on crafted controllers that combine (heuristic) motion planners with the use of hand-crafted features to localize the target visually. Recently learning approaches to tackle this problem have been presented [2]–[5], however a consistent issue faced by most approaches is the reliance on large amounts of data to train these models. For example, Google researchers addressed this problem by developing an \"arm farm\" with 6 to 14 robots collecting data in parallel [3]. Generalization forms another challenge: many current systems are brittle when learned models are applied to robotic configurations that differ from those used in training. This leads to the question: Is there a better way to learn and transfer visuo-motor policies on robots for tasks such as reaching?\nVarious approaches have been proposed to address these problems in a robot learning context: (i) the use of simulators and synthetic data [4], [6]–[8]; (ii) methods that transfer the learned models to real-world scenarios [9], [10]; (iii) directly learning real-world tasks by collecting large amounts of data [3], [11].\nThe contribution of this paper is a method that connects these three, usually separately considered, approaches. We propose a modular deep learning approach to efficiently learn and transfer visuo-motor policies from simulated to real\n*This research was conducted by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision (project number CE140100016).

Vision and kinematics data is gathered in simulation (cheap) to decrease the amount of real world collection necessary (costly). Significantly, by introducing a modular approach the perception skill and the controller can be transferred individually to a robotic platform, while retaining the ability to fine-tune them in an end-to-end fashion to further improve hand-eye coordination on a real robot (in this research a Baxter).\nThe use of both simulated (with domain randomization) and real (domain adaptation) data makes this approach able to transfer perception to the real world (3.2 cm accuracy) with only 3000 simulated and 186 real images. Benefiting from the modular structure and weighted end-to-end finetuning, the learned visuo-motor policy can achieve a reaching accuracy of 2.2 cm with only 333 trajectories (30225 statevelocity pairs). The learned visuo-motor policy is not only able to reach a target object in clutter with seen distractor objects but also for the cases with novel (not seen in training) distractor objects and even when the target object is moving."

Especially robotic vision tasks – robotic tasks based directly on real image data – such as navigation [12], object grasping and manipulation [3], [11], [13] have seen increased interest. The lack of largescale real-world datasets, which are expensive and slow to acquire, limit the general applicability of the approach and has so far limited the broader application. Collecting the datasets required for deep learning has been sped up by using many robots operating in parallel [3]. With over 800,000 grasp attempts recorded, a deep network was trained to predict the success probability of a sequence of motions aiming at grasping using a 7 DoF robotic manipulator with a 2-finger gripper. Combined with a simple derivative-free optimization algorithm the grasping system achieved a success rate of 80%. Another example of dataset collection for grasping is the approach to self-supervised grasp learning in the real world where force sensors were used to autonomously label samples [11]. After training with 50,000 real-world trials using a staged leaning method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) achieved a grasping success rate around 70%. These are impressive results but achieved at high cost in terms of dollars, space and time.\nDeepMind showed that a deep reinforcement learning system is able to synthesize control actions for computer games directly from vision data [14]. While this result is an important and exciting breakthrough it does not transfer directly to real robots with real cameras observing real scenes [2]. In fact very modest image distortions in the simulation environment (small translations, Gaussian noise and scaling of the RGB color channels) caused the performance of the system to fall dramatically. Introducing a real camera observing the game screen was even worse [15].\nThere has been increasing interest to create robust visuomotor policies for robotic applications, especially in reaching and grasping. Levine et al. introduced a CNN-based policy representation architecture with an added guided policy search (GPS) to learn visuo-motor policies (from joint angles and camera images to joint torques) [16], which allows reduction in the number of real world training examples by providing an oracle (or expert’s initial condition to start learning). Impressive results were achieved in complex tasks, such as hanging a coat hanger, inserting a block into a toy, and tightening a bottle cap. Recently it has been proposed to simulated depth images to learn and then transfer grasping skills to real-world robotic arms [17], yet no adaptation in the real-world has been performed.\nTransfer learning attempts to develop methods to transfer knowledge between different tasks (scenarios) [18], [19]. To reduce the amount of data collected in the real world (expensive), transferring skills from simulation to the real world is an attractive alternative. Progressive neural networks are leveraged to improve transfer and avoid catastrophic forgetting when learning complex sequences of tasks [20]. Their effectiveness has been validated on reinforcement learning tasks, such as Atari and 3D maze game playing. Modular reinforcement learning approaches have shown skill transfer capabilities in simulation [21]. However, methods for\nreal-world robotic applications are still scarce and require manually designed mapping information, e.g. similaritybased approach to skill transfer for robots [9]. To reduce the number of real-world images required, a method of adapting visual representations from simulated to real environments was proposed, achieving a success rate of 79.2% in a “hook loop” task, with 10 times less real-world images [10]. Domain randomization has also been successfully used to transfer deep neural networks from simulation to the real world [7], [8]."

To make the learning and transfer of visuo-motor policies more efficient, we propose to separate a deep neural network into perception and control modules connected by a bottleneck layer (Fig. 2). The bottleneck forces the network to learn a low-dimensional representation, not unlike Auto-encoders [24]. The difference is that we explicitly equate the bottleneck layer with the object position (x∗).\nWith the bottleneck, the perception module learns how to estimate the object position x∗ from a raw-pixel image I; the control module learns to determine the most appropriate joint velocities v given the object position and joint angles q (defined as scene configuration Θ = [x∗,q]). The values of x∗ and q are normalized to the interval [0, 1]."

Note that s = I in Equation 2 for the end-to-end fine-tuning, rather than Θ. The control module is updated using only Lc, while the perception module is updated using the weighted loss\nL = βLp + (1− β)LBNc , (3)\nwhere LBNc is a pseudo-loss which reflects the loss of Lc in the bottleneck; β ∈ [0, 1] is a balancing weight. From the backpropagation algorithm [25], we can infer that δL = βδLp + (1 − β)δLBNc , where δL is the gradients resulting from L; δLp and δLBNc are the gradients resulting respectively from Lp and LBNc (equivalent to that resulting from Lc in the perception module)."

      "text" : "Perception datasets contain a number of image-position (I-x∗) pairs. In this work, we label the position of the target cuboid top centre as the target position x∗ rather than its mass-centre. Aiming to get a good balance between domain randomization and adaptation, we collected both simulated and real data as shown in Fig. 4 for investigation. The simulated data was collected using V-REP [26] (a robotic simulation platform) through domain randomization [7] in the following aspects:\n• number of distractor objects in clutter: random in [0, 9]; • shape of distractor objects in clutter: random in 9\nprimitive shapes with different geometries (5 cuboids, 2 spheres, 2 cylinders); • pose of distractor objects: random position in the operation area and random orientation of the axis pointing upwards; • color of distractor objects: random RGB values; • left arm configuration: random in joint space, excluding\nthe ones with self-collision; • color of the table, floor, robot body and target cuboid:\nrandom changes based on reference colors (±10%); • camera pose: random changes of each right arm joint\nangle based on reference angles (±1%); • camera field of view (FoV): random changes based on\na reference FoV (±2%); • table pose: random changes based on a reference posi-\ntion ([±1.5%,±5%,±1%]) and a reference orientation of the axis pointing upwards (±7%);\nAll the above randomization is uniformly distributed. The reference colors , FoV and table pose were tuned manually to approximate the real scene. The reference joint angles were tuned in the real world, making sure the in-hand camera can see the entire operation area. The parameters for the aspects randomized based on references were manually tuned to simulate possible variations in the real scene.\nThe real images shown in Fig. 4 were collected on a real Baxter robot (Fig. 1B) with random objects and left arm configurations. The ground-truth position of the target blue cuboid was collected by putting the end-effector bottom centre on the cuboid top centre and recording the left arm configuration (target configuration q∗) for forward kinematics, i.e., x∗ = K(q∗). The ground-truth position collected in this way is accurate enough for the benchmark task, although some errors might be caused by manually matching the end-effector with the cuboid. This ground-truth position collection method was also used in the control performance evaluation in Section V.\nIn training, to increase the training data diversity, data augmentation is done on-the-fly for both simulated and real images by varying image brightness (±80% for simulated images and ±40% for real images) and white balance (±2.5%) in a post-processing manner. These augmentation parameters were empirically determined.\nControl datasets contain a number of sceneconfiguration-velocity (Θ-v) pairs (i.e., trajectories) as well as image-velocity (I-v) and image-position (I-x∗) pairs. Θ-v pairs are for training control modules separately (Section III-B.2); I-v and I-x∗ pairs are for end-to-end fine-tuning to obtain δLc and δLp (Section III-B.3).\nWe collected control datasets in simulation using V-REP. Trajectories were generated to control the left arm with a random initial configuration (excluding the ones with selfcollision) to reach a target arbitrarily placed in the operation area, regardless of obstacle avoidance. As introduced in Section IV-A, the random initial configuration has a normal distribution around the reference configuration shown in Fig. 3B; the random targets are uniformly distributed in the operation area. When generating the trajectories, the pseudo inverse method (V-REP internal implementation) was used to calculate the desired arm configuration to reach a target, i.e., q∗ = K−1(x∗). Then a simple proportional controller was used to control the left arm to reach the desired configuration from its initial configuration with a control frequency of 20Hz. In the process, the target cuboid position, joint angles and velocity commands were recorded, accompanying with the images from the camera in the right hand. Experiments (Section V-B) show that simulated control training data is sufficient to achieve good performance alone – there is no need to collect real control datasets."

They were trained with different combinations of images:\n• the number of simulated images from 0 to 3000; • the number of real images from 0 to 279.\nAs introduced in Section III-B.1, all the 15 perception modules were first trained using simulated images then finetuned with real images. The training was from scratch, except that the first convolutional layer was initialized with weights from pre-trained VGG16 [22]. In training, we used a minibatch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.01. RmsProp [27] was adopted, the same in the training of control modules (Section V-B) and end-to-end fine-tuning (Section V-C). The pixel values in images were normalized to [−1, 1] per image. The mean and standard deviation of their perception errors for a test set are shown in Fig. 5. The test set has 48 real images where the target is uniformly distributed in the operation area, with random distractor objects that have appeared in training.\nFrom Fig. 5, we can see that the perception modules trained with only simulated (the bottom row) or real images (the left most column) have very large errors. For the ones trained with both simulated and real images, increasing the number of either simulated or real images helped reduce the error. Fine-tuning (adaptation) with as few as 93 real images can make a perception module work in the real world with an average error of 6.9 cm.

To evaluate the feasibility of the approach, we compare three combined networks:\n• EE0: composed by PP and CC, directly connected after separate training without end-to-end fine-tuning; • EE1: EE0 end-to-end fine-tuned naively, only using the control loss Lc; • EE2: EE0 fine-tuned using the proposed approach with weighted losses.\nIn the weighted end-to-end fine-tuning for EE2, β = 0.9 (empirically determined), we used a learning rate of 0.01 and a mini-batch size of 8 and 64 for control and perception losses respectively. 30225 image-velocity pairs in the control dataset (333 trajectories) for CC were used in the fine-tuning to obtain δLc ; its image-position pairs were used to obtain δLp . To make sure that the perception module remembers the adaptation to the real scene, the 186 real images for PP were also used to obtain δLp . In a mini-batch for δLp , 87.5% samples were real ones, i.e., at each weight updating step, 56 real and 8 simulated images were used.\nIn the naive fine-tuning for EE1, we used the same learning rate and a mini-batch size of 64 for Lc. Similarly, 87.5% samples in a mini-batch were real ones, labelled with velocities obtained using the same method in Section IV-C.\nThe evaluation of fine-tuning was first done in the real world without distractor objects on the table as shown in Fig. 7A, using the metrics of control error, success rate and time cost. Their results in 15 real-world reaching trials are listed in Table I. The 15 trials were for the same targets and initial left arm configurations used in Section V-B.\nFrom the results for the single object case (Fig. 7A), we can see that, after the weighted end-to-end fine-tuning, EE2 achieved a better performance compared to EE0: 27% smaller control error; 17% higher success rate; 27% fewer average steps. In comparison, EE1 has a much worse performance than EE0. This shows that the proposed approach of end-to-end fine-tuning with weighted losses is able to significantly improve the performance of a combined network, but a naive approach could make the performance even worse.\nIn addition, EE2 even has a smaller control error than the perception error of PP. If we individually evaluate the perception module in EE2, its perception error increased from 3.2±1.7 cm to 4.2±3.5 cm. This indicates that the endto-end fine-tuning did improve the coordination between the perception and control modules (hand-eye coordination) in EE2, rather than improving them individually.\nTo further evaluate the performance of EE2 in more challenging cases with novel distractor objects in clutter and the target cuboid partially occluded, we conducted more experiments in settings as shown in Fig. 7B-C. From the results in Table I, we can see that EE2 achieved a comparable performance to that in Case A (Fig. 7A) even when there were multiple novel distractor objects in clutter (Fig. 7B). For the case with the target cuboid partially occluded (Fig. 7C), we observed a performance drop, but it was still able to reach half of the targets. We also tested EE2 in the case when the target cuboid was moving (Fig. 7D). It was able to adapt to target position changes in real time and performed well in most cases as shown in the attached video1."

Although we explicitly equated the bottleneck layer with the target object position in this work, the bottleneck in general could be any explicit or latent low-dimensional features, like Auto-encoders. The perception and control modules can\n1The video is also on the project page https://goo.gl/P1c354.\nalso be trained with other methods such as unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. The feasibility of the modular approach for reinforcement learning (DQN) has been validated in a planar reaching task [23], [28].\nb) Domain randomization and adaptation: In Section V-A, the perception module trained with 3000 simulated images has a large error (50.2±23.0 cm), much higher than expected from [7]. Apart from the experiments in Section VA, we also trained a number of perception modules using simulated images with random RGB values for the table, floor and robot body rather than ±10% changes around the reference colors. However, this did not bring obvious accuracy improvement. Possible reasons include: too simple textures (only random RGB values); too simple randomization for light conditions; no simulated shadows; or sensitivity to domain randomization parameters and tuning.\nNevertheless, the adaptation with just a few real images (as few as 93) is able to transfer a network from simulation to the real world, and needs fewer simulated images to reach a comparable accuracy to [7]. The combination of domain randomization and adaptation is promising for more efficient deep neural network transfer."
