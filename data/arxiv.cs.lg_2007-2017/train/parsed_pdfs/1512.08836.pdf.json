      "text" : "Data driven approaches to modeling dynamical systems is important in applications ranging from time series forecasting for market predictions to filtering in robotic systems. The classic generative approach is to assume that each observation is correlated to the value of a latent state and then model the dynamical system as a graphical model, or latent state space model, such as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). To learn the parameters of the model from observed data, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) based methods attempt to maximize the likelihood of the observations with respect to the parameters. This approach has proven to be highly successful in some applications (Coates et al., 2008; Roweis & Ghahramani,\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\n1999), but has at least two shortcomings. First, it may be difficult to find an appropriate parametrization for the latent states. If the model is parametrized incorrectly, the learned model may exhibit poor performance on inference tasks such as Bayesian filtering or predicting multiple time steps into the future. Second, learning a latent state space model is difficult. The MLE objective is non-convex and finding the globally optimal solution is often computationally infeasible. Instead, algorithms such as ExpectationMaximization (EM) are used to compute locally optimal solutions. Although the maximizer of the likelihood objective can promise good performance guarantees when it is used for inference, the locally optimal solutions returned by EM typically do not have any performance guarantees.\nSpectral Learning methods are a popular alternative to MLE for learning models of dynamical systems (Boots, 2012; Boots et al., 2011; Hsu et al., 2009; Hefny et al., 2015). This family of algorithms provides theoretical guarantees on discovering the global optimum for the model parameters under the assumptions of infinite training data and realizability. However, in the non-realizable setting — i.e. model mismatch (e.g., using learned parameters of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) model for a non-linear dynamical system) — these algorithms lose any performance guarantees on using the learned model for filtering or other inference tasks. For example, Kulesza et al. (2014) shows when the model rank is lower than the rank of the underlying dynamical system, the inference performance of the learned model may be arbitrarily bad.\nBoth EM and spectral learning suffer from limited theoretical guarantees: from model mismatch for spectral methods, and from computational hardness for finding the global optimality of non-convex objectives for MLE-based methods. In scenarios where our ultimate goal is to infer some quantity from observed data, a natural solution is to skip the step of learning a model, and instead directly optimize the inference procedure. Toward this end, we generalize the supervised message-passing Inference Machine approach\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n08 83\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 M\nay 2\nof Ross et al. (2011b); Ramakrishna et al. (2014); Lin et al. (2015). Inference machines do not parametrize the graphical model (e.g., design of potential functions) and instead directly train predictors that use incoming messages and local features to predict outgoing messages via black-box supervised learning algorithms. By combining the model and inference procedure into a single object — an Inference Machine — we directly optimize the end-to-end quality of inference. This unified perspective of learning and inference enables stronger theoretical guarantees on the inference procedure: the ultimate task that we care about.\nOne of the principal limitations of inference machines is that they require supervision. If we only have access to observations during training, then there is no obvious way to apply the inference machine framework to graphical models with latent states. To generalize Inference Machines to dynamical systems with latent states, we leverage ideas from Predictive State Representations (PSRs) (Littman et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2004; Boots et al., 2011; Hefny et al., 2015). In contrast to latent variable representations of dynamical systems, which represent the belief state as a probability distribution over the unobserved state space of the model, PSRs instead maintain an equivalent belief over sufficient features of future observations.\nWe propose PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINES (PSIMs), an algorithm that treats the inference procedure (filtering) on a dynamical system as a composition of predictors. Our procedure takes the current predictive state and the latest observation from the dynamical system as inputs and outputs the next predictive state (Fig. 1). Since we have access to the observations at training, this immediately brings the supervision back to our learning problem — we quantify the loss of the predictor by measuring the likelihood that the actual future observations are generated from the predictive state computed by the learner. PSIM allows us to treat filtering as a general supervised learning problem handed-off to a black box learner of our choosing. The complexity of the learner naturally controls the tradeoff between computational complexity and prediction accuracy. We provide two algorithms to train a PSIM. The first algorithm learns a sequence of non-stationary filters which are provably consistent in the realizable case. The second algorithm is more data efficient and learns a stationary filter which has reduction-style performance guarantees.\nThe three main contributions of our work are: (1) we provide a reduction of unsupervised learning of latent state space models to the supervised learning setting by leveraging PSRs; (2) our algorithm, PSIM, directly minimizes error on the inference task—closed loop filtering; (3) PSIM works for general non-linear latent state space models and guarantees filtering performance even in agnostic setting."

      "text" : "In addition to the MLE-based approaches and the spectral learning approaches mentioned in Sec. 1, there are several supervised learning approaches related to our work. Data as Demonstrator (DaD) (Venkatraman et al., 2015) applies the Inference Machine idea to fully observable Markov chains, and directly optimizes the open-loop forward prediction accuracy. In contrast, we aim to design an unsupervised learning algorithm for latent state space models (e.g., HMMs and LDSs) to improve the accuracy of closed loop prediction–Bayesian filtering. It is unclear how to apply DaD to learning a Bayesian filter. Autoregressive models (Wei, 1994) on k-th order fully observable Markov chains (AR-k) use the most recent k observations to predict the next observation. The AR model is not suitable for latent state space models since the beliefs of latent states are conditioned on the entire history. Learning mappings from entire history to next observations is unreasonable and one may need to use a large k in practice. A large k, however, increases the difficulty of the learning problem (i.e., requires large computational and samples complexity).\nIn summary, our work is conceptually different from DaD and AR models in that we focus on unsupervised learning of latent state space models. Instead of simply predicting next observation, we focus on predictive state—a distribution of future observations, as an alternative representation of the beliefs of latent states."

At every time step t, the latent state of the dynamical system, st ∈ Rm, stochastically generates an observation, xt ∈ Rn, from an observation model P (xt|st). The stochastic transition model P (st+1|st) computes the predictive distribution of states at t+ 1 given the state at time t. We define the belief of a latent state st+1 as the distribution of st+1 given all the past observations up to time step t: {x1, ..., xt}, which we denote as ht."

      "text" : "Let us define bt as the belief P (st|ht−1). When the transition model P (st+1|st) and observation model P (xt|st) are known, the belief bt can be computed by a special-case of message passing called forward belief propagation:\nbt+1 = 1\nP (xt|ht−1) ∫ st btP (st+1|st)P (xt|st)dst. (1)\nThe above equation essentially maps the belief bt and the current observation xt to the next belief bt+1.\nConsider the following linear dynamical system:\nst+1 = Ast + s, s ∼ N (0, Q), xt = Cst + x, x ∼ N (0, R), (2)\nwhere A ∈ Rm×m is the transition matrix, C ∈ Rn×m is the observation matrix, and Q ∈ Rm×m and R ∈ Rn×n are noise covariances. The Kalman Filter (Van Overschee & De Moor, 2012) update implements the belief update in Eq. 1. Since P (st|ht−1) is a Gaussian distribution, we simply use the mean ŝt and the covariance Σt to represent P (st|ht−1). The Kalman Filter update step can then be viewed as a function that maps (ŝt,Σt) and the observation xt to (ŝt+1,Σt+1), which is a nonlinear map.\nGiven the sequences of observations {xt}t generated from the linear dynamical system in Eq. 2, there are two common approaches to recover the parameters A,C,Q,R. Expectation-Maximization (EM) attempts to maximize the likelihood of the observations with respect to parameters (Roweis & Ghahramani, 1999), but suffers from locally optimal solutions. The second approach relies on Spectral Learning algorithms to recover A,C,Q,R up to a linear transformation (Van Overschee & De Moor, 2012).1 Spectral algorithms have two key characteristics: 1) they use an observable state representation; and 2) they rely on method-of-moments for parameter identification instead of likelihood. Though spectral algorithms can promise global optimality in certain cases, this desirable property does not hold under model mismatch (Kulesza et al., 2014). In this case, using the learned parameters for filtering may result in poor filtering performance."

      "text" : "Recently, predictive state representations and observable operator models have been used to learn from, filter on, predict, and simulate time series data (Jaeger, 2000; Littman et al., 2001; Singh et al., 2004; Boots et al., 2011; Boots & Gordon, 2011; Hefny et al., 2015). These models provide a compact and complete description of a dynamical system that is easier to learn than latent variable models, by representing state as a set of predictions of observable quantities such as future observations.\nIn this work, we follow a predictive state representation (PSR) framework and define state as the distribution of ft = [x T t , ..., x T t+k−1]\nT ∈ Rkn, a k-step fixed-sized time window of future observations {xt, ..., xt+k−1} (Hefny et al., 2015). PSRs assume that if we can predict everything about ft at time-step t (e.g., the distribution of ft), then we also know everything there is to know about the state of a dynamical system at time step t (Singh et al., 2004). We\n1Sometimes called subspace identification (Van Overschee & De Moor, 2012) in the linear time-invariant system context.\nassume that systems we consider are k-observable2 for k ∈ N+: there is a bijective function that maps P (st|ht−1) to P (ft|ht−1). For convenience of notation, we will present our results in terms of k-observable systems, where it suffices to select features from the next k observations.\nFollowing Hefny et al. (2015), we define the predictive state at time step t as E[φ(ft)|ht−1] where φ is some feature function that is sufficient for the distribution P (ft|ht−1). The expectation is taken with respect to the distribution P (ft|ht−1): E[φ(ft)|ht−1] =∫ ft φ(ft)P (ft|ht−1)dft. The conditional expectation can be understood as a function of which the input is the random variable ht−1. For example, we can set E[φ(f)|ht−1] = E[f, ffT |ht−1] if P (ft|ht−1) is a Gaussian distribution (e.g., linear dynamical system in Eq. 2 ); or we can set φ(f) = [xt ⊗ ... ⊗ xt+k−1] if we are working on a discrete models (discrete latent states and discrete observations), where xt is an indicator vector representation of the observation and ⊗ is the tensor product. Therefore, we assume that there exists a bijective function mapping P (f |ht−1) to E[φ(ft)|ht−1]. For any test f ′t , we can compute the probability of P (f ′t |ht−1) by simply using the predictive state E[φ(ft)|ht−1]. Note that the mapping from E[φ(ft)|ht−1] to P (f ′t |ht−1) is not necessarily linear. To filter from the current predictive state E[φ(ft)|ht−1] to the next state E[φ(ft+1)|ht] conditioned on the most recent observation xt (see Fig. 1 for an illustration), PSRs additionally define an extended state E[ζ(ft, xt+k)|ht−1] =∫ (ft,xt+k)\nζ(ft, xt+k)P (ft, xt+k|ht−1)d(ft, xt+k), where ζ is another feature function for the future observations ft and one more observation xt+k. PSRs explicitly assume there exists a linear relationship between E[φ(ft)|ht−1] and E[ζ(ft, xt+k)|ht−1], which can be learned by Instrumental Variable Regression (IVR) (Hefny et al., 2015). PSRs then additionally assume a nonlinear conditioning operator that can compute the next predictive state with the extended state and the latest observation as inputs.\n2This assumption allows us to avoid the cryptographic hardness of the general problem (Hsu et al., 2009)."

      "text" : "The original Inference Machine framework reduces the problem of learning graphical models to solving a set of classification or regression problems, where the learned classifiers mimic message passing procedures that output marginal distributions for the nodes in the model (Langford et al., 2009; Ross et al., 2011b; Bagnell et al., 2010). However, Inference Machines cannot be applied to learning latent state space models (unsupervised learning) since we do not have access to hidden states’ information.\nWe tackle this problem with predictive states. By using an observable representation for state, observations in the training data can be used for supervision in the inference machine. More formally, instead of tracking the hidden state st, we focus on the corresponding predictive state E[φ(ft)|ht−1]. Assuming that the given predictive state E[φ(ft)|ht−1] can reveal the probability P (ft|ht−1), we use the training data ft to quantify how good the predictive state is by computing the likelihood of ft. The goal is to learn an operator F (the green box in Fig. 1) which deterministically passes the predictive states forward in time conditioned on the latest observation:\nE[φ(ft+1)|ht] = F ( E[φ(ft)|ht−1], xt ) , (3)\nsuch that the likelihood of the observations {ft}t being generated from the sequence of predictive states {E[φ(ft)|ht−1]}t is maximized. In the standard PSR framework, the predictor F can be regarded as the composition of the linear mapping (from predictive state to extended state) and the conditioning operator. Below we show if we can correctly filter with predictive states, then this is equivalent to filtering with latent states as in Eq. 1."

We now describe the corresponding belief propagation for updating the predictive state from E[φ(ft)|ht−1] to E[φ(ft+1)|ht] conditioned on the new observation xt. Since we assume that the mapping from P (st|ht−1) to P (ft|ht−1) and the mapping from P (ft|ht−1) to E[φ(ft)|ht−1] are both bijective, there must exist a bijective map q and its inverse q−1 such that q(P (st|ht−1)) = E[φ(ft)|ht−1] and q−1(E[φ(ft)|ht−1]) = P (st|ht−1),3 then the message passing in Eq. 1 is also equivalent to:\nE[φ(ft+1)|ht] = q(P (st+1|ht)) (4) = q ( ∫\nst\nP (st|ht−1)P (st+1|st)P (xt|st) P (xt|ht−1)\ndst )\n= q ( ∫\nst\nq−1(E[φ(ft)|ht−1])P (st+1|st)P (xt|st) P (xt|ht−1)\ndst )\n3The composition of two bijective functions is bijective.\nEq. 4 explicitly defines the map F that takes the inputs of E[φ(ft)|ht−1] and xt and outputs E[φ(ft+1)|ht]. This map F could be non-linear since it depends the transition model P (st+1|st), observation model P (xt|st) and function q, which are all often complicated, non-linear functions in real dynamical systems. We do not place any parametrization assumptions on the transition and observation models. Instead, we parametrize and restrict the class of predictors to encode the underlying dynamical system and aim to find a predictor F from the restricted class. We call this framework for inference the PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINE (PSIM).\nPSIM is different from PSRs in the following respects: (1) PSIM collapses the two steps of PSRs (predict the extended state and then condition on the latest observation) into one step—as an Inference Machine—for closed-loop update of predictive states; (2) PSIM directly targets the filtering task and has theoretical guarantees on the filtering performance; (3) unlike PSRs where one usually needs to utilize linear PSRs for learning purposes (Boots et al., 2011), PSIM can generalize to non-linear dynamics by leveraging non-linear regression or classification models.\nImagine that we can perform belief propagation with PSIM in predictive state space as shown in Eq. 4, then this is equivalent to classic filter with latent states as shown in Eq. 1. To see this, we can simply apply q−1 on both sides of the above equation Eq. 4, which exactly reveals Eq. 1. We refer readers to the Appendix for a detailed case study of the stationary Kalman Filter, where we explicitly show this equivalence. Thanks to this equivalence, we can learn accurate inference machines, even for partially observable systems. We now turn our focus on learning the map F in the predictive state space."

Forward Training learns a non-stationary filter for each time step. Namely, at time step t, forward training learns a hypothesis Ft that approximates the filtering procedure at time step t: m̂t+1 = Ft(m̂t, xt), where m̂t is computed by Ft−1(m̂t−1, xt−1) and so on. Let us define m̂it as the predictive state computed by rolling out F1, .., Ft−1 on trajectory τi to time step t − 1. We define f it as the next k observations starting at time step t on trajectory τi. At each time step t, the algorithm collects a set of training data Dt, where the feature variables zt consist of the predictive states m̂it from the previous hypothesis Ft−1 and the local observations xit, and the targets consist of the corresponding future observations f it+1 across all trajectories τi. It then trains a new hypothesis Ft over the hypothesis class F to minimize the loss over dataset Dt. PSIM with Forward Training aims to find a good sequence of hypotheses {Ft} such that:\nmin F1∈F,...FT∈F Eτ∼Dτ [ 1 T T∑ t=1 d(Ft(m̂ τ t , x τ t ), f τ t+1) ] , (5)\ns.t. m̂τt+1 = Ft(m̂ τ t , x τ t ),∀t ∈ [1, T − 1], (6)\nwhere m̂1 = arg minm ∑M t=1 d(m, f i 1), which is equal to 1 T ∑T i=1 φ(f i i ). Let us define ωt as the joint distribution of feature variables zt and targets ft+1 after rolling out F1, ..., Ft−1 on the trajectories sampled from Dτ . Under this definition, the filter error defined above is equivalent to 1T ∑T t=1 E(z,f)∼ωt [ d(Ft(z), f) ] . Note essentially the dataset Dt collected by Alg. 1 at time step t forms a finite sample estimation of ωt.\nTo analyze the consistency of our algorithm, we assume every learning problem can be solved perfectly (risk minimizer finds the Bayes optimal) (Langford et al., 2009). We\nfirst show that under infinite many training trajectories, and in realizable case — the underlying true filters F ∗1 , ..., F ∗ T are in the hypothesis class F , Alg. 1 is consistent: Theorem 4.1. With infinite many training trajectories and in the realizable case, if all learning problems are solved perfectly, the sequence of predictors F1, F2, ..., FT from Alg. 1 can generate exact predictive states E[φ(fτt )|hτt−1] for any trajectory τ ∼ Dτ and 1 ≤ t ≤ T .\nWe include all proofs in the appendix. Next for the agnostic case, we show that Alg. 1 can still achieve a reasonable upper bound. Let us define t = minF∼F E(z,f)∼ωt [d(F (z), f)], which is the minimum batch training error under the distribution of inputs resulting from hypothesis class F . Let us define max = maxt{ t}. Under infinite many training trajectories, even in the model agnostic case, we have the following guarantees for filtering error for Alg. 1:\nTheorem 4.2. With infinite many training trajectories, for the sequence {Ft}t generated by Alg. 1, we have: Eτ∼Dτ [ 1 T T∑ t=1 d(Ft(m̂ τ t , x τ t ), f τ t+1) ] = 1 T ∑ t t ≤ max.\nTheorem. 4.2 shows that the filtering error is upperbounded by the average of the minimum batch training errors from each step. If we have a rich class of hypotheses and small noise (e.g., small Bayes error), t could be small.\nTo analyze finite sample complexity, we need to split the dataset into T disjoint sets to make sure that the samples in the datasetDt are i.i.d (see details in Appendix). Hence we reduce forward training to T independent passive supervised learning problems. We have the following agnostic theoretical bound: Theorem 4.3. With M training trajectories, for any F ∗t ∈F ,∀t, we have with probability at least 1− δ:\nEτ∼Dτ [ 1 T T∑ t=1 d(Ft(m̂ τ t , x τ t ), f τ t+1) ] ≤ Eτ∼Dτ [ 1 T T∑ t=1 d(F ∗t (m̂ τ t , x τ t ), f τ t+1)\n] + 4νR̄(F) + 2 √ T ln(T/δ)\n2M , (7)\nwhere v = supF,z,f 2‖F (z) − f‖2, R̄(F) = 1T ∑T t=1Rt(F)) andRt(F) is the Rademacher number of F under ωt.\nAs one might expect, the learning problem becomes harder as T increases, however our finite sample analysis shows the average filtering error grows sublinearly as Õ( √ T ).\nAlthough Alg. 1 has nice theoretical properties, one shortcoming is that it is not very data efficient. In practice, it\nis possible that we only have small number of training trajectories but each trajectory is long (T is big). This means that we may have few training data samples (equal to the number of trajectories) for learning hypothesis Ft. Also, instead of learning non-stationary filters, we often prefer to learn a stationary filter such that we can filter indefinitely. In the next section, we present a different algorithm that utilizes all of the training data to learn a stationary filter."

Hence the filtering error of F̂ is upper bounded by the minimum batch training\nerror that could be achieved by doing regression on DN within classF .

The sequences of observations are collected from the linear stationary Kalman filter of the LDS (Boots, 2012; Hefny et al., 2015). The details of the LDS are in Appendix.\nSince the data is collected from the stationary Kalman filter of the 2-observable LDS, we set k = 2 and use φ1(ft) = [xt, xt+1]. Note that the 4-dimensional predictive state E[φ1(ft)|ht] will represent the exact conditional distribution of observations (xt, xt+1) and therefore is equivalent to P (st|ht−1) (see the detailed case study for LDS in Appendix). With linear ridge regression, we test PSIM with forward training, PSIM with DAgger, and AR models (AR-k) with different lengths (k steps of past observations) of history on this dataset. For each method, we compare the average filtering error e to eF which is computed by using the underlying linear filter F of the LDS.\nFig. 2 shows the convergence trends of PSIM with DAgger, PSIM with Forward Training, and AR as the number of training trajectories N increases. The prediction error for AR with k = 5, 10, 20 is too big to fit into the plot. PSIM with DAgger performs much better with few training data while Forward Training eventually slightly surpasses DAgger with sufficient data. The AR-k models need long histories to perform well given data gnereated by latent state space models, even for this 2-observable LDS. Note AR-\n35 performs regression in a 70-dimensional feature space (35 past observations), while PSIM only uses 6-d features (4-d predictive state + 2-d current observation).

The 13 dimensional noisy observations consist of the robot arm’s 7 joint torques as well as the the 3D force and torque vectors. Note the fixed higher level control policy for the drill assembly task is not given in the observations and must be learned as part of the dynamics; (2) Human Motion Capture: the dataset consists of 48 skeletal tracks of 300 timesteps each from a Vicon motion capture system from three human subjects performing walking actions. The observations consist of the 3D positions of the various skeletal parts (e.g. upperback, thorax, clavicle, etc.); (3) Video Textures: the datasets consists of one video of flag waving and the other one of waves on a beach.\nFor these dynamical systems, we do not test PSIM with Forward Training since our benchmarks have a large number of time steps per trajectory. Throughout the experiments, we set k = 5 for all datasets except for video textures, where we set k = 3. For each dataset, we randomly pick a small number of trajectories as a validation set for parameter tuning (e.g., ridge, rank for N4SID and IVR, band width for RFF). We partition the whole dataset into ten folds, train all algorithms on 9 folds and test on 1 fold. For the feature function φ1, the average one-step filtering errors and its standard deviations across ten folds are shown in Tab. 1. Our approaches outperforms the two baselines across all datasets. Since the datasets are generated from complex dynamics, PSIM with RFF exhibits better performance than PSIM with Linear. This experimentally supports our theorems suggesting that with powerful regressors, PSIM could perform better. We implement PSIM with back-propagation using Theano with several\ntraining approaches: gradient descent with step decay, RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) and AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) (see Appendix. E). With random initialization, backpropagation does not achieve comparable performance, except on the flag video, due to local optimality.We observe marginal improvement by using back-propogation to refine the solution from DAgger. This shows PSIM with DAgger finds good models by itself (details in Appendix. E). We also compare these approaches for multi-step look ahead (Fig. 3). PSIM consistently outperforms the two baselines.\nTo show predictive states with larger k encode more information about latent states, we additionally run PSIM with k = 1 using φ1 . PSIM (DAgger) with k = 5 outperforms k = 1 by 5% for robot assembly dataset, 6% for motion capture, 8% for flag and 32% for beach video. Including belief over longer futures into predictive states can thus capture more information and increase the performance.\nFor feature function φ2 and k = 5, with linear ridge regression, the 1-step filter error achieved by PSIM with DAgger across all datasets are: 2.05± 0.08 on Robot Drill Assembly, 5.47± 0.42 on motion capture, 154.02± 9.9 on beach video, and 1.27e3± 13e1 on flag video.

Under the assumption of infinite training trajectories, minimizing the empirical risk over Dt is equivalent to minimizing the true risk Eτ [d(F (mτt , xτt ), fτt+1)]. Since we use sufficient features for distribution P (ft|ht−1) and we assume the system is k-observable, there exists a underlying deterministic map, which we denote as F ∗t here, that maps mτt and xτt to mτt+1 (Eq. 4 represents F ∗t ). Without loss of generality, for any τ , conditioned on the history hτt , we have that for a noisy observation fτt :\nφ(fτt+1)|hτt = E[φ(fτt+1)|hτt ] + (13) = mτt+1 + (14)\n= F ∗t (m τ t , x τ t ) + , (15)\nwhere E[ ] = 0.

Since it is equal to F ∗ and we have F ∗ ∈ F due to the realizable assumption, the risk minimization at step t exactly finds F ∗t . Using m̂τt (equals to mτt based on the induction assumption for step t), and xτt , the risk minimizer F ∗ then computes the exact mτt+1 for time step t + 1.

The above assumption promises that the data St for training each filter Ft is i.i.d. Note that each Si now contains M/T i.i.d trajectories.\nSince we assume that at time step t, we use St (rolling out F1, ..., Ft−1 on trajectories in St) for training Ft, we can essentially treat each training step independently: when learning Ft, the training data z, f are sampled from ωt and are i.i.d.\nNow let us consider time step t. With the learned F1, ..., Ft−1, we roll out them on the trajectories in St to get MT i.i.d samples of (z, f) ∼ ωt.

      "heading" : "D. Case Study: Stationary Kalman Filter",
      "text" : "To better illustrate PSIM, we consider a special dynamical system in this section. More specifically, we focus on the stationary Kalman filter (Boots, 2012; Hefny et al., 2015) 7:\nst+1 = Ast + s, s ∼ N (0, Q), xt = Cst + x, x ∼ N (0, R). (24)\nAs we will show, the Stationary Kalman Filter allows us to explicitly represent the predictive states (sufficient statistics of the distributions of future observations are simple). We will also show that we can explicitly construct a bijective map between the predictive state space and the latent state space, which further enables us to explicitly construct the predictive state filter. We will show that the predictive state filter is closely related to the original filter in the latent state space.\nThe k-observable assumption here essentially means that the observability matrix: O = [ C CA CA2 ... CAk−1 ]> is full (column) rank. Now let us define P (st|ht−1) = N (ŝt,Σs), and P (ft|ht−1) = N (f̂t,Σf ). Note that Σs is a constant for a stationary Kalman filter (the Kalman gain is converged). Since Σf is purely determined by Σs, A, C, R, Q, it is also a constant. It is clear now\n7For a well behaved system, the filter will become stationary (Kalman gain converges) after running for some period of time. Our definition here is slightly different from the classic Kalman filter: we focus on filtering from P (st|ht−1) (without conditioning on the observation xt generated from st) to P (st+1|ht), while traditional Kalman filter usually filters from P (st|ht) to P (st+1|ht+1).\nthat f̂t = Oŝt. When the Kalman filter becomes stationary, it is enough to keep tracking ŝt. Note that here, given ŝt, we can compute f̂t; and given f̂t, we can reveal ŝt as O†f̂t, where O† is the pseudo-inverse of O. This map is bijective since O is full column rank due to the k-observability.\nNow let us take a look at the update of the stationary Kalman filter:\nŝt+1 = Aŝt −AΣsCT (CΣsCT +R)−1(Cŝt − xt) = Aŝt − L(Cŝt − xt), (25)\nwhere we define L = AΣsCT (CΣsCT +R)−1. Here due to the stationary assumption, Σs keeps constant across time steps. Multiple O on both sides and plug in O†O, which is an identity, at proper positions, we have:\nf̂t+1 = Oŝt+1 = OA(O†O)ŝt −OL(CO†Oŝt − xt)\n= OAO†f̂t −OL(CO†f̂t − xt) = Ãf̂t − L̃(C̃f̂t − xt) (26)\n= [ Ã− L̃C̃ L̃ ] [f̂t xt ] , (27)\nwhere we define Ã = OAO†, C̃ = CO† and L̃ = OL. The above equation represents the stationary filter update step in predictive state space. Note that the deterministic map from (f̂t,Σf ) and xt to (f̂t+1,Σf ) is a linear map (F defined in Sec. 4 is a linear function with respect to f̂t and xt). The filter update in predictive state space is very similar to the filter update in the original latent state space except that predictive state filter uses operators (Ã, C̃, Q̃) that are linear transformations of the original operators (A,C,Q).\nWe can do similar linear algebra operations (e.g., multiply O and plug in O†O in proper positions) to recover the stationary filter in the original latent state space from the stationary predictive state filter. The above analysis leads to the following proposition: Proposition D.1. For a linear dynamical system with k-observability, there exists a filter in predictive state space (Eq. 27) that is equivalent to the stationary Kalman filter in the original latent state space (Eq. 25).\nWe just showed a concrete bijective map between the filter with predictive states and the filter with the original latent states by utilizing the observability matrix O. Though we cannot explicitly construct the bijective map unless we know the parameters of the LDS (A,B,C,Q,R), we can see that learning the linear filter shown in Eq. 27 is equivalent to learning the original linear filter in Eq. 25 in a sense that the predictive beliefs filtered from Eq. 27 encodes as much information as the beliefs filtered from Eq. 25 due to the existence of a bijective map between predictive states and the beliefs for latent states.\nD.1. Collection of Synthetic Data\nWe created a linear dynamical system with A ∈ R3×3, C ∈ R2×3, Q ∈ R3×3, R ∈ R2×2. The matrix A is full rank and its largest eigenvalue is less than 1. The LDS is 2-observable. We computed the constance covariance matrix Σs, which is a fixed point of the covariance update step in the Kalman filter. The initial distribution of s0 is set to N (1,Σs). We then randomly sampled 50000 observation trajectories from the LDS. We use half of the trajectories for training and the left half for testing."

We implemented PSIM with Back-propagation in Theano (Bastien et al., 2012). For random initialization, we uniformly sample non-zero small matrices to avoid gradient blowing up. For training, we use mini-batch gradient descent where each trajectory is treated as a batch. We tested several different gradient descent approaches: regular gradient descent with step decay, AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012), RMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012). We report the best performance from the above approaches. When using the solutions from PSIM with DAgger as an initialization for back-propagation, we use the same setup. We empirically find that RMSProp works best across all our datasets for the inference machine framework, while regular gradient descent generally performs the worst.\nTab. 2 shows the results of using different training methods with ridge linear regression as the underlying model.\nAdditionally, we test back-propagation for PSIM with Kernel Ridge regression as the underlying model: m̂t+1 = Wη(m̂t, xt), where η is a pre-defined, deterministic feature function that maps (m̂t, xt) to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space approximated with Random\nFourier Features (RFF). Essentially, we lift the inputs (m̂t, xt) into a much richer feature space (a scaled, and transition invariant feature space) before feeding it to the next module. The results are shown in Table. 3. As we can see, with RFF, back-propagation achieves better performance than back-propagation with simple linear regression (PSIM-Linear (Bp)). This is expected since using RFF potentially captures the non-linearity in the underlying dynamical systems. On the other hand, PSIM with DAgger achieves better results than back-propagation across all the datasets. This result is consistent with the one from PSIM with ridge linear regression.\nOverall, several interesting observations are: (1) back-propagation with random initialization achieves reasonable performance (e.g., good performance on flag video compared to baselines), but worse than the performance of PSIM with DAgger. PSIM back-propagation is likely stuck at locally optimal solutions in some of our datasets; (2) PSIM with DAgger and Back-propagation can be symbiotically beneficial: using back-propagation to refine the solutions from PSIM with DAgger improves the performance. Though the improvement seems not significant over the 400 epochs we ran, we do observe that running more epochs continues to improve the results; (3) this actually shows that PSIM with DAgger itself finds good filters already, which is not surprising because of the strong theoretical guarantees that it has."

However, they are difficult to learn from data and learned models often lack performance guarantees on inference tasks such as filtering and prediction. In this work, we present the PREDICTIVE STATE INFERENCE MACHINE (PSIM), a data-driven method that considers the inference procedure on a dynamical system as a composition of predictors. The key idea is that rather than first learning a latent state space model, and then using the learned model for inference, PSIM directly learns predictors for inference in predictive state space. We provide theoretical guarantees for inference, in both realizable and agnostic settings, and showcase practical performance on a variety of simulated and real world robotics benchmarks.",
