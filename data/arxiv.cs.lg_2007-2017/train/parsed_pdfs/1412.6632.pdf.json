      "text" : "Obtaining sentence level descriptions for images is becoming an important task and it has many applications, such as early childhood education, image retrieval, and navigation for the blind. Thanks to the rapid development of computer vision and natural language processing technologies, recent work has made significant progress on this task (see a brief review in Section 2). Many previous methods treat it as a retrieval task. They learn a joint embedding to map the features of both sentences and images to the same semantic space. These methods generate image captions by retrieving them from a sentence database. Thus, they lack the ability of generating novel sentences or describing images that contain novel combinations of objects and scenes.\nIn this work, we propose a multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks (m-RNN) model 2 to address both the task of generating novel sentences descriptions for images, and the task of image and sentence retrieval. The whole m-RNN model contains a language model part, a vision part and a multimodal part. The language model part learns a dense feature embedding for each word in the\n1Most recently, we adopt a simple strategy to boost the performance of image captioning task significantly. More details are shown in Section 8. The code and related data (e.g. refined image features and hypotheses sentences generated by the m-RNN model) are available at https://github.com/mjhucla/mRNN-CR.\n2A previous version of this work appears in the NIPS 2014 Deep Learning Workshop with the title “Explain Images with Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks” http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1090 (Mao et al. (2014)). We observed subsequent arXiv papers which also use recurrent neural networks in this topic and cite our work.

The vision part contains a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which generates the image representation. The multimodal part connects the language model and the deep CNN together by a one-layer representation. Our m-RNN model is learned using a log-likelihood cost function (see details in Section 4). The errors can be backpropagated to the three parts of the m-RNN model to update the model parameters simultaneously.\nIn the experiments, we validate our model on four benchmark datasets: IAPR TC-12 (Grubinger et al. (2006)), Flickr 8K (Rashtchian et al. (2010)), Flickr 30K (Young et al. (2014)) and MS COCO (Lin et al. (2014)). We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming all the other methods for the three tasks: generating novel sentences, retrieving images given a sentence and retrieving sentences given an image. Our framework is general and can be further improved by incorporating more powerful deep representations for images and sentences."

      "text" : "Deep model for computer vision and natural language. The methods based on the deep neural network developed rapidly in recent years in both the field of computer vision and natural language. For computer vision, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) propose a deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with 8 layers (denoted as AlexNet) and outperform previous methods by a large margin in the image classification task of ImageNet challenge (Russakovsky et al. (2014)). This network structure is widely used in computer vision, e.g. Girshick et al. (2014) design a object detection framework (RCNN) based on this work. Recently, Simonyan & Zisserman (2014) propose a CNN with over 16 layers (denoted as VggNet) and performs substantially better than the AlexNet. For natural language, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) shows the state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, such as speech recognition and word embedding learning (Mikolov et al. (2010; 2011; 2013)). Recently, RNNs have been successfully applied to machine translation to extract semantic information from the source sentence and generate target sentences (e.g. Kalchbrenner & Blunsom (2013), Cho et al. (2014) and Sutskever et al. (2014)).\nImage-sentence retrieval. Many previous methods treat the task of describing images as a retrieval task and formulate the problem as a ranking or embedding learning problem (Hodosh et al. (2013); Frome et al. (2013); Socher et al. (2014)). They first extract the word and sentence features (e.g. Socher et al. (2014) uses dependency tree Recursive Neural Network to extract sentence features) as well as the image features. Then they optimize a ranking cost to learn an embedding model that maps both the sentence feature and the image feature to a common semantic feature space. In this way, they can directly calculate the distance between images and sentences. Recently, Karpathy et al. (2014) show that object level image features based on object detection results can generate better results than image features extracted at the global level.\nGenerating novel sentence descriptions for images. There are generally three categories of methods for this task. The first category assumes a specific rule of the language grammar. They parse the sentence and divide it into several parts (Mitchell et al. (2012); Gupta & Mannem (2012)). Each part is associated with an object or an attribute in the image (e.g. Kulkarni et al. (2011) uses a Conditional Random Field model and Farhadi et al. (2010) uses a Markov Random Field model). This kind of method generates sentences that are syntactically correct. The second category retrieves similar captioned images, and generates new descriptions by generalizing and re-composing the retrieved captions (Kuznetsova et al. (2014)). The third category of methods, which is more related to our method, learns a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs (i.e. sentences and images), using for example, Deep Boltzmann Machines (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov (2012)), and topic models (Barnard et al. (2003); Jia et al. (2011)). They generate sentences with richer and more flexible structure than the first group. The probability of generating sentences using the model can serve as the affinity metric for retrieval. Our method falls into this category. More closely related to our tasks and method is the work of Kiros et al. (2014b), which is built on a Log-BiLinear model (Mnih & Hinton (2007)) and use AlexNet to extract visual features. It needs a fixed length of context (i.e. five words), whereas in our model, the temporal context is stored in a recurrent architecture, which allows arbitrary context length.\nShortly after Mao et al. (2014), several papers appear with record breaking results (e.g. Kiros et al. (2014a); Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2014); Vinyals et al. (2014); Donahue et al. (2014); Fang et al. (2014); Chen & Zitnick (2014)). Many of them are built on recurrent neural networks. It demonstrates the effectiveness of storing context information in a recurrent layer. Our work has two major difference from these methods. Firstly, we incorporate a two-layer word embedding system in the m-RNN network structure which learns the word representation more efficiently than the single-layer word embedding. Secondly, we do not use the recurrent layer to store the visual information. The image representation is inputted to the m-RNN model along with every word in the sentence description. It utilizes of the capacity of the recurrent layer more efficiently, and allows us to achieve state-ofthe-art performance using a relatively small dimensional recurrent layer. In the experiments, we show that these two strategies lead to better performance. Our method is still the best-performing approach for almost all the evaluation metrics."

      "text" : "We briefly introduce the simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Elman network (Elman (1990)). Its architecture is shown in Figure 2(a). It has three types of layers in each time frame:\nthe input word layer w, the recurrent layer r and the output layer y. The activation of input, recurrent and output layers at time t is denoted as w(t), r(t), and y(t) respectively. w(t) denotes the current word vector, which can be a simple 1-of-N coding representation h(t) (i.e. the one-hot representation, which is binary and has the same dimension as the vocabulary size with only one non-zero element) Mikolov et al. (2010). y(t) can be calculated as follows:\nx(t) = [w(t) r(t− 1)]; r(t) = f1(U · x(t)); y(t) = g1(V · r(t)); (1)\nwhere x(t) is a vector that concatenates w(t) and r(t−1), f1(.) and g1(.) are element-wise sigmoid and softmax function respectively, and U, V are weights which will be learned.\nThe size of the RNN is adaptive to the length of the input sequence. The recurrent layers connect the sub-networks in different time frames. Accordingly, when we do backpropagation, we need to propagate the error through recurrent connections back in time (Rumelhart et al. (1988))."

      "text" : "The structure of our multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) is shown in Figure 2(b). It has five layers in each time frame: two word embedding layers, the recurrent layer, the multimodal layer, and the softmax layer).\nThe two word embedding layers embed the one-hot input into a dense word representation. It encodes both the syntactic and semantic meaning of the words. The semantically relevant words can be found by calculating the Euclidean distance between two dense word vectors in embedding layers. Most of the sentence-image multimodal models (Karpathy et al. (2014); Frome et al. (2013); Socher et al. (2014); Kiros et al. (2014b)) use pre-computed word embedding vectors as the initialization of their model. In contrast, we randomly initialize our word embedding layers and learn them from the training data. We show that this random initialization is sufficient for our architecture to generate the state-of-the-art result. We treat the activation of the word embedding layer II (see Figure 2(b)) as the final word representation, which is one of the three direct inputs of the multimodal layer.\nAfter the two word embedding layers, we have a recurrent layer with 256 dimensions. The calculation of the recurrent layer is slightly different from the calculation for the simple RNN. Instead of concatenating the word representation at time t (denoted as w(t)) and the recurrent layer activation at time t− 1 (denoted as r(t− 1)), we first map r(t− 1) into the same vector space as w(t) and add them together:\nr(t) = f2(Ur · r(t− 1) +w(t)); (2) where “+” represents element-wise addition. We set f2(.) to be the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), inspired by its the recent success when training very deep structure in computer vision field (Nair & Hinton (2010); Krizhevsky et al. (2012)). This differs from the simple RNN where the sigmoid function is adopted (see Section 3.1). ReLU is faster, and harder to saturate or overfit the data than non-linear functions like the sigmoid. When the backpropagation through time (BPTT) is conducted for the RNN with sigmoid function, the vanishing or exploding gradient problem appears since even the simplest RNN model can have a large temporal depth 3. Previous work (Mikolov et al. (2010; 2011)) use heuristics, such as the truncated BPTT, to avoid this problem. The truncated BPTT stops the BPTT after k time steps, where k is a hand-defined hyperparameter. Because of the good properties of ReLU, we do not need to stop the BPTT at an early stage, which leads to better and more efficient utilization of the data than the truncated BPTT.\nAfter the recurrent layer, we set up a 512 dimensional multimodal layer that connects the language model part and the vision part of the m-RNN model (see Figure 2(b)). This layer has three inputs: the word-embedding layer II, the recurrent layer and the image representation. For the image representation, here we use the activation of the 7th layer of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) or 15th layer of VggNet (Simonyan & Zisserman (2014)), though our framework can use any image features. We map the activation of the three layers to the same multimodal feature space and add them together to obtain the activation of the multimodal layer:\nm(t) = g2(Vw ·w(t) +Vr · r(t) +VI · I); (3)\n3We tried Sigmoid and Scaled Hyperbolic Tangent function as the non-linear functions for RNN in the experiments but they lead to the gradient explosion problem easily.\nwhere “+” denotes element-wise addition, m denotes the multimodal layer feature vector, I denotes the image feature. g2(.) is the element-wise scaled hyperbolic tangent function (LeCun et al. (2012)):\ng2(x) = 1.7159 · tanh( 2\n3 x) (4)\nThis function forces the gradients into the most non-linear value range and leads to a faster training process than the basic hyperbolic tangent function.\nBoth the simple RNN and m-RNN models have a softmax layer that generates the probability distribution of the next word. The dimension of this layer is the vocabulary size M , which is different for different datasets."

Perplexity is a standard measure for evaluating language model. The perplexity for one word sequence (i.e. a sentence) w1:L is calculated as follows:\nlog2 PPL(w1:L|I) = − 1\nL L∑ n=1 log2 P (wn|w1:n−1, I) (5)\nwhere L is the length of the word sequence, PPL(w1:L|I) denotes the perplexity of the sentence w1:L given the image I. P (wn|w1:n−1, I) is the probability of generating the word wn given I and previous words w1:n−1. It corresponds to the activation of the SoftMax layer of our model.\nThe cost function of our model is the average log-likelihood of the words given their context words and corresponding images in the training sentences plus a regularization term. It can be calculated by the perplexity:\nC = 1 N Ns∑ i=1 Li · log2 PPL(w (i) 1:Li |I(i)) + λθ · ‖θ‖22 (6)\nwhere Ns and N denotes the number of sentences and the number of words in the training set receptively, Li denotes the length of ith sentences, and θ represents the model parameters.\nOur training objective is to minimize this cost function, which is equivalent to maximize the probability of generating the sentences in the training set using the model. The cost function is differentiable and we use backpropagation to learn the model parameters."

      "text" : "We use the trained m-RNN model for three tasks: 1) Sentences generation, 2) Image retrieval (retrieving most relevant images to the given sentence), 3) Sentence retrieval (retrieving most relevant sentences to the given image).\nThe sentence generation process is straightforward. Starting from the start sign wstart or arbitrary number of reference words (e.g. we can input the first K words in the reference sentence to the model and then start to generate new words), our model can calculate the probability distribution of the next word: P (wn|w1:n−1, I). Then we can sample from this probability distribution to pick the next word. In practice, we find that selecting the word with the maximum probability performs slightly better than sampling. After that, we input the picked word to the model and continue the process until the model outputs the end sign wend.\nFor the retrieval tasks, we use our model to calculate the probability of generating a sentence w1:L given an image I: P (w1:L|I) = ∏ n P (wn|w1:n−1, I). The probability can be treated as an affinity measurement between sentences and images.\nFor the image retrieval task, given the query sentence wQ1:L, we rank the dataset images I D according to the probability P (wQ1:L|ID) and retrieved the top ranked images. This is equivalent to the perplexity-based image retrieval in Kiros et al. (2014b).\nThe sentence retrieval task is trickier because there might be some sentences that have high probability or perplexity for any image query (e.g. sentences consist of many frequently appeared words). To solve this problem, Kiros et al. (2014b) uses the perplexity of a sentence conditioned on the averaged image feature across the training set as the reference perplexity to normalize the original perplexity. Different from them, we use the normalized probability where the normalization factor is the marginal probability of wD1:L:\nP (wD1:L|IQ)/P (wD1:L); P (wD1:L) = ∑ I′P (w D 1:L|I ′ ) · P (I ′ ) (7)\nwhere wD1:L denotes the sentence in the dataset, I Q denotes the query image, and I\n′ are images\nsampled from the training set. We approximate P (I ′ ) by a constant and ignore this term. This strategy leads to a much better performance than that in Kiros et al. (2014b) in the experiments. The normalized probability is equivalent to the probability P (IQ|wD1:L), which is symmetric to the probability P (wQ1:L|ID) used in the image retrieval task."

(2002)) as the evaluation metrics. BLEU scores were originally designed for automatic machine translation where they rate the quality of a translated sentences given several reference sentences. Similarly, we can treat the sentence generation task as the “translation” of the content of images to sentences. BLEU remains the standard evaluation metric for sentence generation methods for images, though it has drawbacks. For some images, the reference sentences might not contain all the possible descriptions in the image and BLEU might penalize some correctly generated sentences. Please see more details of the calculation of BLEU scores for this task in the supplementary material section 10.3 5.\nSentence Retrieval and Image Retrieval. We adopt the same evaluation metrics as previous works (Socher et al. (2014); Frome et al. (2013); Karpathy et al. (2014)) for both the tasks of sentences retrieval and image retrieval. We use R@K (K = 1, 5, 10) as the measurement. R@K is the recall rate of a correctly retrieved groundtruth given top K candidates. Higher R@K usually means better retrieval performance. Since we care most about the top-ranked retrieved results, the R@K scores with smaller K are more important.\nThe Med r is another metric we use, which is the median rank of the first retrieved groundtruth sentence or image. Lower Med r usually means better performance. For IAPR TC-12 datasets, we use additional evaluation metrics to conduct a fair comparison with previous work (Kiros et al. (2014b)).

(2014b) to calculate the BLEU scores and perplexity. These two evaluation metrics are not necessarily correlated to each other for the following reasons. As mentioned in Section 4, perplexity is calculated according to the conditional probability of the word in a sentence given all of its previous reference words. Therefore, a strong language model that successfully captures the distributions of words in sentences can have a low perplexity without the image content. But the content of the generated sentences might be uncorrelated to images. From Table 1, we can see that although our baseline method of RNN generates a low perplexity, its BLEU score is low, indicating that it fails to generate sentences that are consistent with the content of images.\nTable 1 shows that our m-RNN model performs much better than our baseline RNN model and the state-of-the-art methods both in terms of the perplexity and BLEU score.\n4www.stat.ucla.edu/˜junhua.mao/m-RNN.html 5The BLEU outputted by our implementation is slightly lower than the recently released MS COCO caption evaluation toolbox (Chen et al.

(2015a)) of the hypotheses w.r.t. to the groundtruth captions of the nearest neighbor images, and rerank the hypotheses according to these scores (see details in Section 8.2)."

We first resize the image so that its short side is 256 pixels. Then we extract features on ten 224 × 224 windows\n8If we directly output the top hypotheses generated by the model, then n = 5 gives us the best performance. But if we want to rerank the hypotheses, then n = 10 gives us a better result on the validation set.\n9We release both types of the features on MS COCO 2014 train, val and test sets.

Finally, we average pool the ten features to make it a 4,096 dimensional feature.\nThe second type is the feature refined by our m-RNN model. It can be calculated as: Ir = g2(VI ·I), where VI is the weight matrix between the image representation and the multimodal layer (see Equation 3), and g2(.) is the scaled hyperbolic tangent function.\nWe show the sample images and their nearest neighbors in Figure 3. We find that compared to the original VggNet features, the features refined by the m-RNN model capture richer and more accurate visual information. E.g., the target image in the second row contains an old woman with a bunch of bananas. The original VggNet features do not retrieve images with bananas in them."

The difference is that Devlin et al. (2015a) treat the captions of the k nearest neighbor images as the hypotheses while our hypotheses are generated by the m-RNN model. More specifically, for each hypothesis, we calculate the mean similarity between this hypothesis and all the captions of the k nearest neighbor images.\nThe consensus score of this hypothesis is the mean similarity score of the m nearest captions. The similarity between a hypothesis and one of its nearest neighbor reference captions is defined by a sentence-level BLEU score (Papineni et al. (2002)) or a sentence-level CIDEr (Vedantam et al. (2014)). We cross-validate the hyperparamters k and m. For the BLEU-based similarity, the optimal k and m are 60 and 175 respectively.

The reranking process is able to improve the rank of good captions.\nWe also show the oracle performance of the ten hypotheses, which is the upper bound of the consensus reranking. More specifically, for each image in our validation set, we rerank the hypotheses according to the scores (BLEU or CIDEr) w.r.t to the groundtruth captions. The results of this oracle reranking are shown in Table 8 (see rows with “-oracle”). The oracle performance is surprisingly high, indicating that there is still room for improvement, both for the m-RNN model itself and the reranking strategy."

The model consists of a deep RNN, a deep CNN and these two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer. Our m-RNN is powerful of connecting images and sentences and is flexible to incorporate more complex image representations and more sophisticated language models."

      "text" : "In this section, we compare different variants of our m-RNN model to show the effectiveness of the two-layer word embedding and the strategy to input the visual information to the multimodal layer.\nThe word embedding system. Intuitively, the two word embedding layers capture high-level semantic meanings of words more efficiently than the single layer word embedding. As an input to the multimodal layer, it offers useful information for predicting the next word distribution.\nTo validate its efficiency, we train three different m-RNN networks: m-RNN-NoEmbInput, m-RNNOneLayerEmb, m-RNN-EmbOneInput. They are illustrated in Figure 5. “m-RNN-NoEmbInput” denotes the m-RNN model whose connection between the word embedding layer II and the multimodal layer is cut off. Thus the multimodal layer has only two inputs: the recurrent layer and the image representation. “m-RNN-OneLayerEmb” denotes the m-RNN model whose two word embedding layers are replaced by a single 256 dimensional word-embedding layer. There are much more parameters of the word-embedding layers in the m-RNN-OneLayerEmb than those in the original m-RNN (256 ·M v.s. 128 ·M + 128 · 256) if the dictionary size M is large. “m-RNNEmbOneInput” denotes the m-RNN model whose connection between the word embedding layer II and the multimodal layer is replaced by the connection between the word embedding layer I and the multimodal layer. The performance comparisons are shown in Table 9.\nTable 9 shows that the original m-RNN model with the two word embedding layers and the connection between word embedding layer II and multimodal layer performs the best. It verifies the effectiveness of the two word embedding layers.\nHow to connect the vision and the language part of the model. We train three variants of m-RNN models where the image representation is inputted into the recurrent layer: m-RNN-VisualInRNN, m-RNN-VisualInRNN-both, and m-RNN-VisualInRNN-Both-Shared. For m-RNN-VisualInRNN, we only input the image representation to the word embedding layer II while for the later two models, we input the image representation to both the multimodal layer and word embedding layer II.\nThe weights of the two connections V (1)I , V (2) I are shared for m-RNN-VisualInRNN-Both-Shared. Please see details of these models in Figure 5. Table 9 shows that the original m-RNN model performs much better than these models, indicating that it is effective to directly input the visual information to the multimodal layer.\nIn practice, we find that it is harder to train these variants than to train the original m-RNN model and we have to keep the learning rate very small to avoid the exploding gradient problem. Increasing the dimension of the recurrent layer or replacing RNN with LSTM (a sophisticated version of RNN Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997)) might solve the problem. We will explore this issue in future work."

(2014b) and plot the mean number of matches of the retrieved groundtruth sentences or images with respect to the percentage of the retrieved sentences or images for the testing set. For the sentence retrieval task, Kiros et al. (2014b) uses a shortlist of 100 images which are the nearest neighbors of the query image in the feature space. This shortlist strategy makes the task harder because similar images might have similar descriptions and it is often harder to find subtle differences among the sentences and pick the most suitable one.\nThe recall accuracy curves with respect to the percentage of retrieved images (sentence retrieval task) or sentences (sentence retrieval task) are shown in Figure 6. The first method, bowdecaf, is a strong image based bag-of-words baseline (Kiros et al. (2014b)). The second and the third models (Kiros et al. (2014b)) are all multimodal deep models.

To calculate BLEU-N (i.e. B-N in the paper whereN=1,2,3,4) score, we first compute the modified n-gram precision (Papineni et al. (2002)), pn. Then we compute the geometric mean of pn up to length N and multiply it by a brevity penalty BP:\nBP = min(1, e1− r c ) (8)\nB-N = BP · e 1N ∑N\nn=1 log pn (9) where r is the length of the reference sentence and c is the length of the generated sentence. We use the same strategy as Fang et al. (2014) where pn, r, and c are computed over the whole testing corpus. When there are multiple reference sentences, the length of the reference that is closest (longer or shorter) to the length of the candidate is used to compute r."

The third category of methods, which is more related to our method, learns a probability density over the space of multimodal inputs (i.e. sentences and images), using for example, Deep Boltzmann Machines (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov (2012)), and topic models (Barnard et al. (2003); Jia et al. (2011)). They generate sentences with richer and more flexible structure than the first group. The probability of generating sentences using the model can serve as the affinity metric for retrieval. Our method falls into this category. More closely related to our tasks and method is the work of Kiros et al. (2014b), which is built on a Log-BiLinear model (Mnih & Hinton (2007)) and use AlexNet to extract visual features. It needs a fixed length of context (i.e. five words), whereas in our model, the temporal context is stored in a recurrent architecture, which allows arbitrary context length. Shortly after Mao et al. (2014), several papers appear with record breaking results (e.g. Kiros et al. (2014a); Karpathy & Fei-Fei (2014); Vinyals et al. (2014); Donahue et al.",

These n best candidates are approximately the n most probable sentences generated by the model, and can be treated as the n hypotheses. In our experiments, we set n = 10 since it gives us a diversified set of hypotheses without too much outliers on our validation set. 8 After generating the hypotheses of a target image, we retrieve its nearest neighbors in the image feature space on the training set (see details in Section 8.1).

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we present a multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) model for generating novel image captions. It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and an image. Image captions are generated according to this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on four benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, Flickr 30K and MS COCO). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we apply the m-RNN model to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval.
