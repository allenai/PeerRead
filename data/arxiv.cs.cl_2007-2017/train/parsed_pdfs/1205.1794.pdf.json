One application of this system is in Speaker Diarization systems. There are several methods for speaker segmentation; however, most of the Speaker Diarization Systems use BIC-based Segmentation methods. The main goal of this paper is to propose a new method for speaker segmentation with higher speed than the current methods - e.g. BIC - and acceptable accuracy. Our proposed method is based on the pitch frequency of the speech. The accuracy of this method is similar to the accuracy of common speaker segmentation methods. However, its computation cost is much less than theirs. We show that our method is about 2.4 times faster than the BICbased method, while the average accuracy of pitch-based method is slightly higher than that of the BICbased method.\nKEYWORDS\nSpeaker Diarization, Speech Segmentation, Pitch-based Speech Segmentation"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The process of speaker change detection from one speaker to another is an important task in many speech processing applications. This task is done before audio indexing, speaker identification, automatic transcription, information extraction, speech summarization and retrieval [1][2][3]. An audio stream can be segmented into various homogeneous parts by recognizing the specific speech characteristics of individual speakers. This process is commonly known as speaker change detection or speaker segmentation. In recent years, there are three major categories of audio segmentation techniques: metric-based, model-based and hybrid methods. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages which will be discussed in the next section.\nThe most common speaker segmentation methods are those metric-based ones which are used Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Since these methods suffer from a great amount of computations, they are very time consuming; however, these methods are highly accurate. Achieving a method which has acceptable accuracy along with high computation speed is very desirable and useful for real time systems. In this paper we will discuss about a proposed method for speech segmentation that doesn’t need previous information about speakers and also hasn’t heavy computation. In other word, we want to solve the problem of low speed of metric-based segmentation methods. For solving this problem we have proposed to use of speaker’s pitch frequency information. In this method the change points are detected according to speakers’ pitch\nfrequency function. Of course using this function has some problems such as increasing error, but by using some techniques we decrease the errors."

      "heading" : "2. A SURVEY ON SPEAKER SEGMENTATION METHODS",
      "text" : "Various speaker segmentation algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms can be categorized into the following categories: metric-based, model-based and hybrid segmentation algorithms.\nAnother approach called decoder-based has also proposed. It is assumed that the sentences uttered by different speakers in a conversation are delimited by pauses [4]. As a consequence the segmentation relies on the accuracy of an inter speaker silence detector which usually works by measuring the energy or zero crossing rate of each segment and comparing it to a predefined or adaptively estimated threshold. The main drawback of this approach is no direct connection exists between a detected silence and an actual speaker change. Because of this assumption, this method isn’t used for actual meeting.\nIn metric-based methods, first an acoustic distance criterion has been defined and then two adjacent windows are shifted along the audio stream. Depending on the application the analysis window may overlap or not. By measuring the distance between these two windows the similarity between these segments is evaluated and a distance curve is formed. This distance curve was often low-pass filtered and the locations of peaks were chosen to be acoustic changing points by heuristic thresholds. Most of the distance measure criterions come from the statistical modeling framework. The feature vectors in each of the two adjacent windows are assumed to follow some probability density(usually Gaussian) and the distance is represented by the dissimilarity of these two densities, e.g., the Kullback-Leibler distance(KL,KL2)[5], generalized likelihood ratio(GLR)[6] and Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC) [7][8][9].\nThe metric-based methods have the advantage of not requiring any prior knowledge on the number of speakers, their identities, or signal characteristics; but they have some disadvantages: (1) it is difficult to decide an appropriate threshold. (2)Each acoustic changing point is detected only by its neighboring acoustic information. (3) To deal with homogenous segments of various lengths, the length of window is usually short (typically 2 seconds), so the feature vectors could be insufficient to obtain robust distance statistics.\nIn the model based approach, a set of models is derived and trained for different speaker classes from a training corpus. It assumes that a speaker change is likely to occur at the time indexes where the model’s identification decision changes from one speaker to another. As a result, prior knowledge is a prerequisite to initialize the speaker models. The models can be created by means of hidden Markov models (HMMs) [10],[11] ,[12] ,Gaussian mixture models (GMM) [13], [14] or support vector machines (SVM) [15], [16], [17].\nHybrid based methods combine metric and model based techniques [18]. A set of speaker models are created by presegmenting the input audio signal using metric based approaches. Then the model based segmentation is applied to yield a more refined segmentation. In [19], HMMs are combined with BIC. Another hybrid system is introduced in [20] where two systems are combined namely LIA system, which is based on HMMs and the CLIPS system, which performs BIC based speaker segmentation followed by hierarchical clustering."

      "heading" : "2.1. Speaker Segmentation based on BIC measure",
      "text" : "Since BIC-based methods are the most common segmentation methods used today, we focus on these methods in detail. BIC is a criterion for choosing a model for a group of data which is\nproposed by Schwarz[21]. Suppose we have a group of data (X) and a Model for describing these data (M). The BIC criterion for this model is shown in Equation 1.\n(1) = log | − #\n2 log\nIn this equation, P(X|M) is the likelihood value of data X to model M. #M represents the number of free parameters in Model M. N represents the number of samples in data X. In the other word, BIC measures the likelihood of the model and data and scores the model[22]. In the above equation, λ is the penalty factor. If λ is set to zero, BIC changes to GLR[23]. To achieve the expected performance for a specific corpus, we could adjust λ value[24]. As described in [21], maximizing BIC results in maximizing the expected value of likelihood of model and data. Therefore, BIC could be used to select the best model of a group of data[21,22].\nSuppose X= xi∈ R d , i = 1,2,...,N is a sequence of feature vectors of d dimensions which are extracted from a speech frame. In such applications, usually MFCC feature vectors are used. BIC criteria don’t have any pre knowledge about the type of feature vectors. Therefore, this criterion could be used even when other feature vectors are used. We suppose that in a frame there are at most two speakers (one speaker boundary). Therefore, the problem of checking if a single speaker change point exists in the frame, could be transformed to a model selection problem[24]. To do this, we consider two adjacent windows (X and Y) around hypothetical time instance (b). Our objective is to decide if a speaker change occurs in this instance time or not.[18].\n• Model M1 supposes that all samples in X are independent and evenly distributed by a multivariate Gaussian process.\n(2) ∶ = , , … , ~ , ∑\n• Model M2 suppose that X is created by two multivariate Gaussian processes.

If ∆ = BIC(M2) – BIC(M1) distributions (M2) is more than that of describing data by a single Gaussian distribution (M1). Therefore, data is not uniform and there is a speaker change point.\nWe should notice that ∆BIC is used to detect only a single acoustic change point in the speech stream. As a result, it is necessary to use other algorithms to detect more change points. For this\npurpose, sequential detecting algorithms function of change point (b).

Therefore, in the environment in which both music and speech signals exist, pitch estimators should be accurate in both fields. The difficulty of detecting f0 in a waveform depends on the wave form. It means that if the waveform contains less high harmonics in the frequency spectrum, or the power of higher harmonics is low, f0 will be simpler to detect[30].\nPitch frequency determination algorithms called PDA, are of a great importance in many speech processing algorithms.

      "text" : "Distance-based speaker segmentation methods, such as BIC method, use cepstral features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). However, there are other feature vectors which can be used for this purpose. In addition, prosodic features like pitch frequency can be used to facilitate distinguish between voice and silence. Pitch frequency changes diagram is a well-suited means for speaker change detection[32]. There are three reasons to use pitch frequency for speaker change detection:\n1- Every speaker has its own pitch frequency which differs from others.\n2- When the speaker changes, pitch frequency diagram has rapid changes.\n(9) c[n] = 12π b log |S(ω)|efghdω i\nTi\n(11) j kl(P) = Q|X(m) X(m + P)| UT\nnVW\n3- For speech segments less than one second, other methods such as BIC-based methods which utilize MFCC features, suffer lack of speaker change detection accuracy. Since,\nthere is not enough information in such a short segments to calculate meaningful MFCC vectors.\nTo make it possible to use pitch frequency information for speaker segmentation, the preliminary stage is to extract pitch frequency using one of the above mentioned methods. We choose AMDF method because of its calculation speed.\nAfter calculation of pitch frequency value for each individual speech frame, we should use this information for speaker change detection. Since rapid changes in the pitch frequency diagram can be used to indicate speaker change, we use this indication afterwards. Suppose to have divide speech stream to N windows and extract pitch frequency for each window independently. To analyze pitch frequency changes, we use derivation function which is shown in Equation 12.\n(12) kmoo(+) = | mpqℎ(B + 1) mpqℎ(B)|\nThen we should determine a threshold value by which we evaluate pitch frequency changes. If derivative function of pitch frequency at one point is above this defined threshold, we consider that point as speaker change point. We define this threshold as 0.7 of maximum difference between higher and lower pitch frequency in the stream. After extracting speaker change points, we could calculate beginning and end of speech segments. This method has very high speed. Nonetheless, its detection accuracy compared with BIC-based methods is less. In the following section accuracy improvement method will be explained."

      "heading" : "5. ACCURACY IMPROVEMENT OF PROPOSED METHOD",
      "text" : "Detailed looking at pitch frequency changes diagram, we noticed that its variation is very sharp. Even during the speech of one speaker, it is be possible to have rapid pitch frequency changes. In these cases, False Alarm (FA) rate error increases. This is the result of considering every point above the threshold as speaker change point.\nAnother problem with this method is the possibility of speaker change while pitch frequency changes is not very quick to be above the predefined threshold. Therefore, we may miss these points of speaker changes and Miss Detection (MD) rate error may be increased. To solve this problem one way may be to choose the threshold value lower to place below the missed points. Obviously, this is not an efficient way, because using the lower threshold, many other points which are not true speaker change points will be placed above the threshold and incorrectly will be reported as change points. As a result, MD rate error decreases at the expense of increase in FA rate error. Using this method decrease the accuracy of speaker change detection method.\nTo cope with this problem, we should apply a function on pitch frequency change function which increase small changes and preserve large changes. Gamma correction function best suited for this purpose.\n(13) stuut1o(+)6 = . o(+)v We apply this function on pitch frequency change diagram. Considering Figure 3, and above mentioned problem, it is clear that for our application, we should use γ<1 which based on our experiments, its best value is 0.3.\nApplying this function, MD rate error decreases. However, since there were false rapid changes before applying gamma correction function, the problem reduce FA rate error, we could benefit the idea used in BIC segmentation. It means that we consider all points above the threshold as speaker change points and investigate correctness of change detection using a small applying this method, results in egregious improvement in detection accuracy.

One application of this system is in Speaker Diarization systems. There are several methods for speaker segmentation; however, most of the Speaker Diarization Systems use BIC-based Segmentation methods. The main goal of this paper is to propose a new method for speaker segmentation with higher speed than the current methods e.g. BIC and acceptable accuracy. Our proposed method is based on the pitch frequency of the speech. The accuracy of this method is similar to the accuracy of common speaker segmentation methods. However, its computation cost is much less than theirs. We show that our method is about 2.4 times faster than the BICbased method, while the average accuracy of pitch-based method is slightly higher than that of the BICbased method.",
