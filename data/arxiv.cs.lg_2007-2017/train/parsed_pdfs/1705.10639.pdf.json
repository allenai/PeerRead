INTRODUCTION\nOne of the best studied problems in grammatical inference is that of finding a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of minimal size that accepts a given set of positive examples and rejects a given set of negative examples of an unknown language. This problem can be very hard. It is the optimization variant of the problem of finding a consistent DFA of a fixed size, which has been shown to be NP-complete [1].\nIn [2], Coste and Nicolas observe that this problem can be encoded as a graph coloring problem. The intuition behind their encoding is as follows. First, a tree-shaped DFA is constructed that accepts exactly the positive examples and rejects exactly the negative ones. Each state in this DFA is represented by a vertex in a conflict graph. Two vertices in the graph are connected by an edge if one vertex represents an accepting state and the other represents a rejecting state. Now, the problem at hand is to color this graph, with the additional constraint that for states that are represented by vertices of the same color, their parents have to be represented by vertices of the same color as well. For such a coloring, a minimal DFA can be constructed in which each state is represented by a different color.\nIn [3], Heule and Verwer propose an encoding of the aforementioned graph coloring problem in propositional logic. Satisfiability, or SAT, is the problem of deciding if there exists an assignment to a propositional logic formula that makes it true. To prove that the minimal size of a DFA is n, Heule and Verwer use an iterative procedure to determine that an encoding for n colors is satisfiable, but an encoding for n− 1 colors is unsatisfiable.\nFor many applications, encoding the problems into propositional logic is not the right choice. Frequently, a better alternative is to express the problems in a richer logic. A first effort in this direction was made by Bruynooghe et. al. [4], who express the encoding by Heule and Verwer in a predicate logic.\nIn this paper we encode the aforementioned grammatical inference problem as a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problem. SMT is the problem of deciding the satisfiability of a formula with respect to one or more background theories expressed in first-order logic, that is, if there exists a SAT assignment consistent with these theories.\nOur encoding has several advantages over the one mentioned before. First, we show that it is faster in practice. Second, it benefits from the continuous efforts by fellow researchers on making SMT solvers more powerful. Third, we argue that it is more natural, because it makes a distinction between the logic that is required to solve the problem, and the logic imposed by the background theories. This allows us to easily extend the encoding to Moore and Mealy machines, and address a wider range of grammatical inference problems."

      "text" : "Let us first recall some basic terminology for propositional logic. In our presentation, we borrow notational conventions from [5]. Let P be a set of Boolean variables. Such a variable p ∈ P can be assigned either true or false. A literal l is a variable p or its negation ¬p. A clause C is a disjunction of literals l1 ∨ . . . ∨ ln. A unit clause is a clause consisting of a single literal. The negation of a clause C is a conjunction of the negations of its literals ¬l1 ∧ . . . ∧ ¬ln. A formula F is a conjunction of clauses C1 ∧ . . . ∧ Cn. Finally, a (partial) assignment M is a (partial) mapping of variables to true or false. A (partial) assignment can be seen as a conjunction of literals, and hence as a formula.\nA clause C is true in an assignment M if at least one of its literals is in M . It is false in M if all of the negations of its literals are in M . Otherwise, it is undefined in M . A formula F is true in M , if all of its clauses are true in M . In that case, M is a model of F .\nSatisfiability (SAT) is the problem of deciding for a given formula F if there exists an assignment M that is a model for F . If no such assignment exists, then F is called unsatisfiable.\nBefore we give a description of satisfiability modulo theories, let us briefly recall the necessary notions of firstorder logic. We refer to [6] and [5] for a more detailed explanation. Central to first-order logic are the notions of formulae, atoms, terms and variables. First-order formulae are clauses constructed over atoms, which are in turn predicates\nconstructed over Boolean variables and terms, which are in turn constructed over variables and constants that are defined over some (in our case finite) domain. A theory defines a set of valid formation rules for formulae, atoms and terms. For our theories (linear inequality and uninterpreted functions), these rules are as follows.\n• A term is inductively defined by the following rules:\n1) Any variable x is a term. 2) Any function f(t1, . . . , tn) over terms t1, . . . , tn is a term.\n• An atom is a statement that may be true or false,\ndepending on the value of its terms. It is defined as being either\n1) an expression of the form t = t′ for terms t and t′, or 2) a predicate P (t1, . . . , tn) over terms t1, . . . , tn; specifically we are concerned with inequality rela-\ntions (<,>,≤,≥).\n• A formula is inductively defined by the following rules:\n1) A disjunction of formulae (∨) is a formula. 2) A negation (¬) of a formula is a formula. 3) An atom is a formula.\nEquality logic for uninterpreted functions is not concerned with the semantics for a function f . This means that f is not restricted by any axioms or rules of inference, if not explicitly added. The theory does, however, impose the standard equality axioms over its terms (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity). In addition, functions are required to be functionally consistent, i.e.\nx1 = y1∧ . . .∧xn = yn =⇒ f(x1, . . . , xn) = f(y1, . . . , yn)\nSatisfiability modulo theories (SMT) is the problem of deciding satisfiability of a (conjunction of) first-order formula(e) with respect to one or more given theories. Typically, this problem is solved as follows. Initially, all atoms in the firstorder formula(e) are replaced by Boolean variables, forgetting about the theory (therefore, we consider the same definitions and notation as given before for the propositional case). The resulting (propositional) formula F is presented to a SAT solver. If a SAT solver determines it to be propositionally unsatisfiable, then we can conclude that the first-order formula is unsatisfiable as well. If, instead, the SAT solver finds a propositional model M for F , then M is given to a so-called theory solver that converts the model back to its first-order form, and checks if it is consistent with the theory. If this is the case then we can conclude that F is T -satisfiable and that M is a so-called T -model of F . Otherwise, the theory solver constructs a theory lemma. A theory lemma is a (propositional) clause C that is a logical consequence from the theory. The SAT solver is then started again for the formula F ∧ C. This process is repeated until the SAT solver finds a T -model for F , or concludes it is unsatisfiable.\nHence, SMT is the problem of deciding for a given theory T and a given formula F , if F is T -satisfiable, or equivalently, if there exists a T -model of F . For a more detailed introduction\nto SMT we refer to [7]. Improvements to the basic approach for solving SMT problems include:\n• checking theory consistency of a (partial) assignment\nwhile it is being built,\n• restarting the SAT solver from a point where the (partial)\nassignment was consistent with the theory,\n• using a theory solver to guide the search for a satisfiable\nmodel by detecting literals that are a logical consequence of the theory, and • periodically replacing a theory T by a stronger theory\nT ∧ T ′.\nThese recent improvements and ongoing advancements make SMT interesting from a grammatical inference perspective."

      "text" : "Grammatical inference is the study concerned with learning formal languages. One of the best studied problems in grammatical inference is that of finding a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) of minimal size that accepts a given set of positive examples and rejects a given set of negative examples of an unknown regular language.\nA DFA is a finite state machine that accepts and rejects strings, which are sequences of symbols. Formally, we define it as a tuple (Σ, Q, q0, δ, λ), where Σ is a finite alphabet of symbols, Q is a finite set of states, q0 is the initial state, δ : Q×Σ → Q is a transition function for states and symbols, λ : Q → B is an output function that returns true if a state is accepting, and false if it is rejecting.\nLet x be a string, then we use xi to denote the symbol at the ith position of x. The position i of a symbol in a string satisfies 1 ≤ i ≤ |x| (i.e. the first symbol of x is x1). We use x[i,j] to denote the substring of x starting at position i and ending at position j (inclusive), i.e. x = x[1,|x|]. A DFA D accepts a string x if, starting in the initial state, the unique computation for x ends in an accepting state. This can be formalized as follows. Let x be a string over Σ, then D accepts x if a sequence of states q′0 . . . q ′ |x| exists such that\n1) q′0 = q0, 2) q′i = δ(q ′ i−1, xi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ |x|, and 3) λ(q′|x|) = true. Let S+ be a sample of strings that should be accepted, and let S− be a sample of strings that should be rejected. Then one way of approaching the grammatical inference problem is by iteratively asking the following question.\nIs there a DFA of at most n states that is consistent with S = {S+, S−}, i.e. accepts all strings in S+ and rejects all strings in S−?\nIf such a DFA D of at most n states exists, and one with at most n − 1 states does not exist, then D is a DFA of minimal size that is consistent with S. The goal is to find such a consistent minimal DFA."

      "heading" : "B. A more expressive encoding",
      "text" : "One solution to this is to define the constraints implied by strings in a non-nested way. Similarly to Heule and Verwer [3], and Bruynooghe et. al. [4], we use an augmented prefix tree (APT) for this. We, however, introduce a more concise set of constraints. An APT A can be considered a partial, tree-shaped DFA that is exactly consistent with S, i.e. it accepts only the set S+ and rejects only the set S−. For every state q of A there exists exactly one string that ends in q. Therefore, we denote the unique state that a string x ends in by qx. This implies that two strings x and y visit the same state if and only if they share a prefix, i.e. x[1,i] = y[1,i] for some 1 ≤ i ≤ min(|x|, |y|). We formally define an APT as (Σ, Q, qǫ, δ, QS, λ), where Σ and Q are the same as before, qǫ is the initial state (i.e. the state reached by the empty string ǫ), δ : Q × Σ ⇀ Q is a partial transition function that satisfies the aforementioned property, QS = {qx ∈ Q : x ∈ S} is the subset of Q in which a string of S ends, and λ : QS → B is an output function for these states. Indeed, no output is defined for the states in Q \\QS . Let us define the set of constraints for finding a DFA D = (Σ, QD, qD0 , δ D, λD) that is consistent with an APT A = (Σ, QA, qAǫ , δ A, QAS , λ\nA) for a given sample S = {S+, S−}. Recall that such a DFA is consistent if and only if it accepts all strings in S+ and rejects all strings in S−, i.e. for each x\nin S λD(δD(q0, x)) = λ A(qx) (we slightly abuse notation here by extending δ to strings). Such a DFA has at most as many states as the APT (but typically significantly less). Therefore, there must exist a surjective (i.e. many-to-one) function π : QA → QD. Our goal is to find a set of constraints for π that make sure that our target DFA D is consistent.\nFirst, let us encode the (partial) transition function δA:\n∀qxa ∈ Q A : x ∈ Σ∗, a ∈ Σ δD(π(qx), a) = π(qxa) (5)\nNow, let us encode the output function λA:\n∀q ∈ QAS λ D(π(qx)) = λ A(qx) (6)\nThe problem at hand is to find a ‘smallest’ π function; i.e. there should be no other function with a smaller image that satisfies these constraints. We can encode this as follows. Let us (again) consider the set of states of D as a set of nonnegative integers. Then the following axioms assert that D has at most n states:\n∀q ∈ QA n−1∨\ni=0\nπ(q) = i (7)\nRemark. The axioms in Equation 7 can also be encoded in the following way (if the solver supports linear inequalities):\n∀q ∈ QA π(q) ≥ 0 ∧ π(q) < n (8)\nAgain, these constraints and axioms are sufficient to determine if there is a DFA with at most n states that is consistent with S, and if the resulting formula is satisfiable the SMT solver’s model provides us with δD and λD. Hence, we can construct a minimal consistent DFA D for S by iteratively incrementing n in Equation 7 or 8."

      "text" : "An advantage of the encoding presented in Section III-B (as opposed to the one presented in Section III-A) is that it can easily be extended to learn Moore and Mealy machines. In this section we present such an encoding.\nA Moore machine is a transducer that produces an output symbol in each state. Formally, it is a tuple (Σ,Λ, Q, q0, δ, λ) where Σ, Q, q0 and δ are the same as for a DFA, Λ is a finite alphabet of output symbols, and λ : Q → Λ is an output function. A Moore machine produces an output symbol every time it (re-)enters a state. Therefore, a sample S for a Moore machine consists of traces, which are pairs (x, y) where x = x1 . . . x|x| is a string over Σ and y = y0y1 . . . y|x| is a string over Λ (observe that |y| = |x|+ 1). A Mealy machine is a transducer whose output symbols are determined by both its current state and the current input symbol. Formally, it is the same as a Moore machine, except that λ : Q× Σ → Λ is a transition output function. A Mealy machine produces an output every time it makes a transition. A sample S for a Mealy machine consists of traces (x, y) where x = x1 . . . x|x| is a string over Σ and y = y1 . . . y|x| is a string over Λ (observe that |y| = |x|). It has been shown in [8] that Moore and Mealy machines are equi-expressive if we neglect the output produced by the initial\nstate of a Moore machine. Therefore, we can define an APT for a sample S of traces produced by either a Moore or Mealy machine M = (Σ,Λ, QM , qM0 , δ M , λM ) in a similar way. We choose to define it as a tuple A = (Σ,Λ, QA, qAǫ , δ A, λA), where Σ, Λ, QA, qAǫ and δ A are as you would expect from previous definitions, and λA : QA \\ qAǫ → Λ is an output function that is defined for all states except qAǫ . One can afterwards add λA(qAǫ ) = y0 for any output string y in S if M is a Moore machine.\nWe can now determine if there is a Moore or Mealy machine with at most n states that is consistent with S by using the set of constraints and axioms presented in Section III-B, if we\n1) define π : QA → QM accordingly, 2) replace D with M in Equation 5, and 3) replace Equation 6 with Equation 9 (for Moore ma-\nchines) or 10 (for Mealy machines).\n∀q ∈ QA λM (π(q)) = λA(q) (9)\n∀qxa ∈ Q A : x ∈ Σ∗, a ∈ Σ λM (π(qx), a) = λ A(qxa) (10)"
