      "text" : "Videos have become increasingly popular on the Internet, for example, hundreds of hours of video contents are uploaded on YouTube every minute. It is impossible to watch these overwhelming amounts of videos, therefore, automatic techniques to search and analyze video contents are highly desired. Generating natural language descriptions for video contents (a.k.a. video captioning) is one of such important techniques for this challenge. It can bene t a wide range of applications such as assisting the visually impaired people and improving the quality of online video retrieval.\nAlthough there have been signi cant breakthroughs recently in image captioning [9, 30, 41, 43, 44, 46], video captioning remains very challenging due to the diversity and complexity of video contents. e open-domain videos contain a broad range of topics,\n∗corresponding author.\nsuch as sports, music, food and so on, which results in very di erent vocabularies and expression styles to describe video contents across topics. For example, sports terms frequently occur in the sports topic while the typical words in the food topic are about cooking and ingredients. e key contents in descriptions for the sports topic are o en the action verbs, while they are object nouns for the food topic and descriptive adjectives for the people topic. us, being aware of the topic information can dramatically narrow down general sentence distributions and enable the caption model to focus on the discriminative video contents under the topic, such as the detailed actions in the sports topic.\nHowever, most of the existing caption models ignore the topic information and mainly try to maximize the overall likelihood for videos in all topics, which have a tendency to seek the most common mode in training sentences as indicated by Lee et al. [20]. Such models not only are prone to generate plain descriptions without details, but also unable to distinguish confusing concepts in a topic. Although a few works [8, 13, 33] have exploited the topic information for video description generation, there are still three main challenges in employing the topic information in video captioning. First, there are no direct topic representations in common video caption datasets, so how can we construct and predict the latent topics of videos? Second, what is an e ective and e cient way to employ the latent topics to guide the caption model for generating topicoriented descriptions? And third, how to train the topic-guided caption model to achieve optimal captioning performance?\nIn this paper, we bring three innovations to deal with the above challenges. First, we propose a multimodal topic mining approach to discover latent video topics from video-sentence pairs. e multimodal latent topics are more semantically coherent and visually consistent than the expert-de ned or textual latent topics in previous work. We then use the teacher-student learning strategy to predict latent topics with multimodal video features. Second, in order to exploit the topic e ectively, we propose a novel topicaware language decoder, which implicitly functions as an ensemble of topic-speci c decoders for each topic, but is computationally more e cient and requires less training data. e predicted video topic automatically modi es weights in the decoder, enabling to generate topic-oriented video descriptions. ird, to optimize the topic-guided caption performance, we develop a multi-task learning architecture to jointly train the caption system with the topic prediction loss and sentence generation loss in an end-to-end manner. It can strengthen the coupling of the two parts to generate be er latent topics and sentence descriptions simultaneously. e overall model is called M&M TGM (Topic-Guided Model with Multimodal latent topic guidance and Multi-task learning). ar X iv :1\n70 8.\n09 66\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\n1 A\nug 2\n01 7\ne main contributions of this paper are as follows: • We present an uni ed framework M&M TGM for video caption-\ning, which can automatically discover and predict the underlying video topics and exploit the topic guidance to generate be er topic-oriented video descriptions. e topic prediction and topicaware sentence generation can be trained jointly with multi-task learning end-to-end. • e proposed M&M TGM requires no additional labelling for video topics and can exploit the limited video caption data e ectively. For the latent topic generation, we propose unsupervised multimodal topic mining for topic discovery and teacher-student learning for topic prediction. For the topic-oriented sentence generation, the topic-aware decoder shares data and parameters among di erent topics which is e cient in both computation and data. • Our proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark video caption datasets: MSR-VTT [42] and Youtube2Text [11]. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis show superior performances of using the multimodal latent topic guidance and multi-task learning strategy. e M&M TGM not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, but also has be er generalization ability. e rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the related work. Section 3 presents the problem formulation. e solution for M&M TGM is described in Section 4. Section 5 presents experimental results and analysis. Section 6 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Image Captioning has a racted growing interests recently. Early works are mainly based on rule systems [17, 19] and suffer from generating exible and accurate descriptions. So more researches have been focusing on the encoder-decoder framework [2, 35] for caption generation. e deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [36] function as the encoder to transform image contents into dense vectors. en the decoder, typically the Long-short Term Memory [12] (LSTM), is utilized to generate sequential words conditioned on image features [41]. Xu et al. [43] propose the spatial a ention mechanism based on the basic encoder-decoder. You et al. [46] and Gan et al. [9] propose the semantic a ention model and semantic compositional networks (SCN) respectively to exploit detected concepts from the image. Our topic-aware language decoder is inspired by SCN but with di erent aims of producing topic-oriented video descriptions, which is more suitable for video captioning task as shown in Section 5.4.\nVideo Captioning is more challenging compared with image captioning due to the temporal dynamics, multiple modalities, and more diverse contents in videos. Yao et al. [45] propose the temporal a ention mechanism, and Pan et al. [25] utilize the hierarchical LSTM encoder to explore the temporal structures. Most previous works only focus on the visual modality [26, 40], but recently Jin et al. [13, 14] and Ramanishka et al. [29] have shown improvement of multimodal fusion for video captioning. To promote the video captioning research for open-domain videos, several large-scale videos with various topic are collected such as MSR-VTT [42] and TGIF [22]. Jin et al. [13] encode expert-de ned topics with multimodal features, which results in their winning of the MSR-VTT challenge [31]. Dong et al. [8] utilize the textual mined topics to\nlearn interpretable features. Shen et al. [33] train separate language decoders for each expert-de ned topic. Chen et al. [4] explore the guidance from textual minded topics to generate topic-aware sentences. In our work, we address the topic diversity challenge in open-domain videos and propose the novel M&M TGM model to jointly generate the latent video topics and topic-oriented video descriptions with multimodal features in a multi-task framework.\nLatent Topic Mining has been a long-standing problem. e latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) proposed by Blei [3] is one of the most classic models to automatically inference the latent topics for textual documents. Doersch et al. [7] utilize a discriminative clustering approach to discover the visual topics. For multimodal data, Li et al. [21] apply the association rule mining algorithm on image-caption pairs to discover the multimodal topics. In our work, we take the multimodal topic mining perspective on videosentence pairs by a weighted multimodal clustering method to obtain semantically coherent and visually consistent latent topics."

      "heading" : "3 Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Our goal is to leverage the underlying video topic information to make the model more pro cient in using vocabularies and expressions within the topic when describing a video.\nSuppose we have a videoV along with a set ofNd textual descriptions Y = {y1, y2, ..., yNd }. Each y ∈ Y is a sentence with Ns words, denoted as y = {w1,w2, ...,wNs }, where w is a word from vocabulary W. We encode the video contentV into a xed-dimensional video representation x. Conditioned on the multimodal video representation x, a caption decoder aims to generate the sentence y with probability\nPr(y|x) = Ns∏ t=1 Pr(wt |x,w<t ) (1)\nwhere w<t denotes the sequential words before the time step t . We abbreviate this as conditional sentence probability. We use RNN as decoder and parameterize the probability Pr(wt |x,w<t ) by the recurrent units shared across time steps, which can be expressed as: [\nPr(wt |x,w<t ;Θd ) ht\n] = ψd (ht−1,wt−1;Θd ) (2)\nwhere ψd is the recurrent unit function, Θd are the parameters of the recurrent unit and ht is the hidden state of the recurrent unit at time step t . We de ne w0 as the start token and h0 as the initialized hidden state. For notation simplicity, we abbreviate eq (2) to Pr(wt |x,w<t ;Θd ) = ψd (ht−1,wt−1;Θd ). Substituting this abbreviation to eq (1), we get:\nPr(y|x;Θd ) = Ns∏ t=1 ψd (ht−1,wt−1;Θd ) (3)\nAs mentioned earlier, videos in di erent topics have quite di erent vocabularies and expression styles in their video descriptions, and di erent topics can coexist in one video. Based on this observation, we introduce the latent topic variables {zi }i=1, ...,K , where K is the number of topics. en the conditional sentence probability, Pr(y|x) is actually the marginal probability of the joint sentence\nand topic distribution conditioned on video content: Pr(y |x) = ∑\nz1, . . .,zK Pr(y, z1, . . . , zK |x) = ∑\nz1, . . .,zK Pr(y |z1, . . . , zK , x)︸ ︷︷ ︸\ntopic-aware sentence distribution Pr(z1, . . . , zK |x)︸ ︷︷ ︸ latent topic distribution\n(4)\nIn the second step of eq (4), we factorize the joint distribution to latent topic distribution and topic-aware sentence distribution.\nWe come to parameterize the probability in eq (4). For latent topic distribution, we parameterize it by topic predictor ψz as follows:\nPr(z1, . . . , zK |x) = ψz (x;Θz ) (5)\nwhere Θz are parameters in the topic predictor. To parameterize the topic-aware sentence distribution by RNN, we need to introduce the topic-related parameter Θ′z in addition to Θd in eq (3) as now the probability we are modelling is also conditioned on topics z1, . . . , zK :\nPr(y |z1, . . . , zK , x;Θd , Θ′z ) = Ns∏ t=1 Pr(wt |w<t , x, z1, . . . , zK ;Θd , Θ′z )\n= Ns∏ t=1 ψd (ht−1, wt−1, z1, . . . , zK ;Θd , Θ′z ) (6)\nPu ing all these together, we get the parameterization for topicaware conditional sentence probability as:\nPr(y |x) = Pr(y |x;Θd , Θ′z, Θz )\n= ∑\nz1, . . .,zK\nψz (x;Θz ) Ns∏ t=1 ψd (ht−1, wt−1, z1, . . . , zK ;Θd , Θ′z ) (7)\nContrasting with conditional sentence probability parameterization in eq (3), we see that we have additional parameters Θz for topic prediction and Θd ,Θ′z for topic-aware sentence modelling in the parameterization of topic-aware conditional sentence probability.\ne standard loss function for caption generation task is to maximize the log probability of the conditional sentence probability:\nLcaption (y, ỹ) = − Ns∑ t=1 ∑ w̃t ∈W δwt ,w̃t log Pr(w̃t |x, w<t ;Θd ) (8)\nwhere δwt ,w̃t is the indicator function. We could directly use this loss to train our topic-aware parameterized model in eq (4) as it is a special form of the general conditional sentence probability. However in training, it requires large amount of data for the model to discover latent topics from scratch and to learn topic-aware sentence distribution simultaneously. e training data of caption task is limited, and as the labelling cost of such training data is very high, the amount of the training data is not likely to grow very fast in the near future. To solve this problem, we introduce an auxiliary task, topic prediction, to guide the caption task. In this task, we leverage the existing topic mining approaches to generate a set of topics as the teacher topics z. e details of the topic mining approach are given in Section 4.2. We use the teacher topics to guide the latent topic learning by an additional topic loss function Ltopic (z, z̃) on the topic predictor ψt (x;Θz ), which penalizes the latent topic predictions that are far away from the teacher z. e details ofdist function in Ltopic (z, z̃)will be discussed in section 4.1. e two losses are combined by the trading o hyper-parameter\nλ ∈ [0, 1): L(y, z, ỹ, z̃) = (1 − λ)Lcaption (y, ỹ) + λLtopic (z, z̃) (9)\nLcaption (y, ỹ) = − Ns∑ t=1 ∑ w̃t ∈W δwt ,w̃t log Pr(w̃t |x, w<t ;Θd , Θ′z, Θz )\n(10) Ltopic (z, z̃) = dist (z, z̃) (11)\nIn this way, we weave the video latent topics into video description generation as guidance."

      "text" : "It is intractable to integrate the topic-aware conditional sentence probability in eq (7) over the latent topic space. But since the latent topic is highly dependent on the video content, usually the latent topic distributions of the video could be very skew with massive likelihood on the peak point. erefore, it is reasonable that we use the maximum latent topic likelihood to approximate the summation over the latent topic space to gain e ciency without losing much accuracy. e approximation for eq (7) is as follows:\nPr(y|x) = ∑\nz1, ...,zK Pr(y|z1, . . . , zK , x)Pr(z1, . . . , zK |x) (12)\n≈ Pr(y|z1 = z̃1, . . . , zK = z̃K , x)Pr(z1 = z̃1, . . . , zK = z̃K |x)\nwhere z̃1, . . . , ˜zK = arg maxz1, ...,zK Pr(z1, . . . , zK |x). Our experiments show such approximation leads us to good results.\ne multi-task training scheme is conducted as follows: 1. We rst pretrain the topic predictor using the topic loss Ltopic , and use it to initialize Θz in the M&M TGM (as shown in eq (7)). For the dist in topic loss, we choose two widely used distances: l2-distance l2(z, z̃) =‖ z − z̃ ‖22 and KL-divergence KL(z, z̃) = ∑Kk=1 z̃k loд(z̃k/zk ).\n2. We then pretrain the topic-aware decoder using the caption loss Lcaption (as shown in eq (10)) with the topic guidance from the xed topic predictor in the above step, and use it as a good initialization for Θ′z and Θd in the M&M TGM (as shown in eq (7)).\n3. Finally, based on the parameters initialization in the above two steps, we use the multi-task loss L(y, z, ỹ, z̃) (as shown in eq (9)) to further train both models jointly, which ne-tunes all the parameters Θz , Θ′z and Θd to optimize the caption performance."

      "text" : "We rst brie y present two topic structures adopted in previous works, and then propose our multimodal latent topic mining approach and the topic prediction model.\nExpert-de ned Topics: e online video websites o en provide an expert-de ned topic schema as shown in Figure 2(a). Video uploaders can select one of the topics to be er organize their videos. Such topics can re ect the topic variety to some extent, but have the following drawbacks: 1) e user assigned labels are noisy with labelling mistakes; 2) e topic distributions are exclusive which ignores the topic diversity inside the video; and 3) ere might exist di erent semantic meanings and visual appearances within a topic, which is suboptimal as latent topics.\nTextual Latent Topics: e annotated descriptions in video caption datasets provide rich and accurate information about the video content, which can also re ect more appropriate latent topic distributions. us, our previous work [4] mined topics from the annotated video captions on the training set. e main idea is to cluster the video captions and each cluster can represent a latent topic. We use the kernel K-means algorithm [6] for clustering. We group all the groundtruth captions of a video as one data sample. Stopwords are removed and the bag-of-words are used as our text features. e cosine kernel is adopted to generate nonlinear cluster separations. Since a video might contain several topics, we utilize the so assignment according to the distance between samples and clusters to generate topic distributions.\nMultimodal Latent Topics: Although the textual latent topics may be er t with the videos’ underlying topic distributions, the mined topics purely based on textual data still su er from the following problems:\n1) Polysemy phenomena: Words can convey several di erent meanings, which might lead to improper assignment of the video. As shown in Figure 2(b), the most frequent word court can either mean tribunal or sports eld, so the video could mistakenly peak at some sports related topics.\n2) Certain messy clusters: e unsupervised clustering method cannot perfectly generate meaningful latent topics, which could produce some semantically unclear topics with dissimilar visual appearances. is brings great harm for the topic prediction model to learn from those messy topics.\nTo address these issues, we further propose to combine the description texts and visual features to learn the multimodal latent topic representation. e textual features are preprocessed in the same way as in textual latent topics and the visual features are elaborated in Section 5.2. We use the weighted kernel K-means algorithm to fuse the textual and visual features with weights of 1 and 0.2 respectively, because we consider the textual features are more accurate than the visual features to unveil an eligible latent topic structure.\nTopic Predictor: We take the teacher-student perspective [1] to train the topic predictorψz . e distributions of the above mined latent topics serve as the teacher z to guide theψz to generate latent topic predictions with the topic prediction loss Ltopic . In this work, we adopt a two-layer perception as the topic predictor based on inputs of multimodal video featuresm1,m2,m3:\nψz (x;Θz ) = so f tmax(W2(φ(W1[m1;m2;m3] + b1) + b2) (13) whereWi ,bi (i = 1, 2) are parameters, [·] denotes feature concatenation and φ is the RELU nonlinear function [10]."

[9], we extend each weight matrix of the conventional LSTM to be an ensemble of a set of topic-dependent weight matrices.\nLet us take one of the input gate weight matricesWiw as an example, and transformation for other parameters in LSTM model are alike. We de ne the ensemble 3D weight matrix Wiτ ∈ Rnh×nw×K , where nh is the number of hidden units and nw is the dimension of input vectors. Wiτ [k] denotes the k-th slice of Wiτ , which represents the 2D weight matrix belonging to the LSTM model for the k-th topic. erefore, we explicitly specify K language decoders, which is, for each topic there is a pair of topic-speci c LSTM weights. Given the latent topic z̃, we can de ne the mixture topic LSTM weight matrix Wi (z̃) ∈ Rnh×nw as\nWi (z̃) = K∑ k=1 z̃kWiτ [k] (20)\nwhere z̃k is the k-th topic in z̃. When z̃ is not the exclusive one-hot topic distribution, the video data is shared among di erent topics. However, the parameters still grow linearly with the number of topics K and no parameters are shared among di erent video topics which can easily result in over- ing. So the 3-way factorization method [16, 24] is used to share parameters. We re-represent Wiτ in terms of three matrices Wia ∈ Rnh×nf , Wib ∈ Rnf ×K and Wic ∈ Rnf ×nw , where nf is the number of factors, such that\nWi (z) =Wia · diaд(Wib z̃) ·Wic (21) Wia and Wic are shared among all topics, while Wib can be viewed as the latent vectors of topics.\nerefore, the transformation from input vectors to input gates is changed from Wiw · wt to Wia · (Wib z̃ Wicwt ). e topic distribution z̃ a ects the LSTM parameters associated to the video when decoding, which implicitly works as an ensemble of K topicaware language decoders."

To save space, we present the sum of all the metrics in Figure 5 and the trends are similar for di erent metrics. e multitask learning with di erent λ > 0 all achieves be er performance\nthan single-task learning (λ = 0), which proves the robustness of our multi-task training with respect to the hyper-parameter."

      "text" : "To gain an intuition of the improvement on generated video descriptions from M&M TGM model, we present some video examples with the video description from Vanilla model and M&M TGM on testing set of MSR-VTT.\nIn Figure 6, we can see that M&M TGM can generate more accurate video descriptions than Vanilla model even though they utilize the same multimodal features. In Figure 7, though the descriptions from Vanilla and M&M TGM are both correct, M&M TGM model can produce more detailed information about the video contents. We also observe that M&M TGM employs more unique words with 493 compared to the 391 unique words in Vanilla model.\ne reason behind these quality improvements could be that M&M TGM can narrow down the sentence generation space according to the predicted latent topics. is enables the model to focus on subtler di erences between similar concepts such as the soccer and rugby sports in the upper row of Figure 6, and cover more detailed descriptions under the topic such as making airplane vs. folding paper in the upper row of Figure 7 with more specialized words."

For example, users could simply assign a category tag to the uploaded videos with minimum costs to rene the automatic generated video descriptions. To evaluate the\nperformance boosts with the human enhancement to our topicguided model, we manually re-annotate the expert-de ned topics for Youtub2Text dataset as the clean version and compare its caption performance with the noisy assigned topics. Results are shown in Table 6 which demonstrates that a huge gain can be achieved with the manual correction of the topics in low cost."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a novel topic-guided caption model to address the topic diversity challenge for open-domain video captioning task. e proposed model can predict the latent topics of videos and then generate topic-oriented video descriptions with the topic guidance jointly in an end-to-end manner. We utilize the multimodal topic mining approach to construct video topics automatically and take a teacher-student learning perspective to predict the latent topics purely from video multimodal contents. e topic-aware decoder can exploit the predicted topics to adjust its weights to t the topic-dependent sentence distributions. Our experimental results on two public video caption benchmark datasets show that the proposed model can generate more accurate and detailed descriptions within di erent topics and improves the performance consistently on all metrics on both datasets. Furthermore, we show that our model has very good generalization ability across datasets. e proposed topic-guided caption model can be considered as a generic framework, which could be integrated with other techniques such as temporal a ention or hierarchical video encoder. We will study such integration in the future."

In this paper, we propose an unied caption framework, M&M TGM, which mines multimodal topics in unsupervised fashion from data and guides the caption decoder with these topics. Compared to pre-dened topics, the mined multimodal topics are more semantically and visually coherent and can reect the topic distribution of videos beer. We formulate the topic-aware caption generation as a multi-task learning problem, in which we add a parallel task, topic prediction, in addition to the caption task. For the topic prediction task, we use the mined topics as the teacher to train a student topic prediction model, which learns to predict the latent topics from multimodal contents of videos. e topic prediction provides intermediate supervision to the learning process. As for the caption task, we propose a novel topic-aware decoder to generate more accurate and detailed video descriptions with the guidance from latent topics. e entire learning procedure is end-to-end and it optimizes both tasks simultaneously. e results from extensive experiments conducted on the MSR-VTT and Youtube2Text datasets demonstrate the eectiveness of our proposed model. M&M TGM not only outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics and on both benchmark datasets, but also achieves beer generalization ability.",
