      "text" : "Learning to rank is a supervised learning problem which objective is to estimate a scoring function from training examples. That function is expected to define a partial order on the examples by scoring relevant instances higher than the non-relevant ones. Examples of applications in which ranking is central are information retrieval (Chapelle & Keerthi, 2010), drug discovery (Agarwal et al., 2010).\nMany machine learning algorithms have been proposed for learning ranking functions. Some of them aim at optimizing a pairwise ranking criterion using exponential loss, like the RankBoost of Freund et al. (2003) or using Hinge loss (Joachims, 2002). Methods based on decision trees have also been investigated (Clémencon & Vayatis, 2009). While these methods\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nhave shown their interests, they may not be optimally targeted at a specific goal which is getting an accurate ranking at the top of the list. Indeed, for instance, in information retrieval, one usually wants to have the most relevant documents as possible at the top of the list, while getting an accurate pairwise ordering in other part of the list is not of great importance. For this reason, several recently proposed algorithms focus on correctly ranking the best instances (Rudin, 2009; Agarwal, 2011).\nFor most of the works we described above, the scoring function is a linear function of the form f(x) = w⊤x, where w is the weight vector that has to be learned. The resulting weight vector w is usually a non-sparse vector, which means that all features will be considered in the scoring function even though they are non-informative. Hence, similarly to other supervised learning paradigms, ranking methods may also benefit from feature selection as keeping only few features in the scoring function may improve performances as well as reducing prediction time. To the best of our knowledge, very few works have addressed the problem of feature selection in ranking (Geng et al., 2007) and in ranking on top of the list problems. Naturally, algorithms like the SVM-RFE or methods based on sparsity-inducing norms like the ℓ1 norm can be easily extended to ranking algorithms. But developing algorithms for embedded feature selection becomes more challenging when loss functions related to ranking on top have to be considered. This is the challenge we want to address in this paper and as far as we know, this is the first paper proposing embedded feature selection using sparsity inducing norms for ranking on top of the list.\nWe focus on the recent p-norm push loss function introduced by Rudin (2009) and more specifically, on the case where p = ∞, denoted as an infinite push framework by Agarwal (2011). In this latter work, Agarwal (2011) has also proposed a support vector like algorithm, named as support vector Infinite Push, which has been proved to perform better than competitors when the goal is to maximize the number of\nrelevant instances on top of the list. Here, we provide a novel algorithm for solving the regularized empirical risk minimization related to the support vector Infinite Push loss function that can also handle sparsity inducing regularizers. While typical methods dealing with sparsity suppose that the loss function is smooth (Bach et al., 2011), our optimization problem is challenging since both the loss function and the regularizer can be non-differentiable. We propose to overcome this issue by proposing an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which is wrapped around the computation of the infinite push loss function proximal operator in addition to the one of the regularizer.\nGlobally, the paper provides contributions to the state of the art in several points: (a) it proposes a numerical scheme for computing the proximal operator of the support vector infinite push loss function, (b) it shows that the optimization framework we consider offers some theoretical guarantees on the uniqueness of the problem minimizer, property that is not always insured by Agarwal’s algorithm, (c) it is the first paper showing that p-norm push ranking algorithms can also embed feature selection through the use of sparsity inducing norms. It demonstrates that ranking on top applications can also benefit from feature selection either by improved performances or reduced prediction time.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the global framework for ranking on top of the list as well as the optimization related to sparse support vector infinite push. In Section 3, the ADMM-based algorithm proposed for solving the problem and the numerical scheme for computing the proximal operator of the infinite push loss are presented. Experimental results are described in Section 4 while conclusion is in Section 5."

Learning such a function can be cast into an empirical regularized risk min-\nimization framework, where the loss function related to the risk is designed so as to favor higher scores for positive examples. Typically, in such a context, the loss function focuses on the average pairwise scoring losses and it can be written as :\nL(f(·), S) = 1\nmn\n∑\ni,j\nIf(x+ i )≤f(x− j )\nwhere I· is the indicator function, S is a set of examples with known labels and f(·) is the scoring function that we want to evaluate. Several extensions of this loss function have been recently considered in order to provide more importance to errors made on top of the lists, for instance by weighting the pairwise loss (Usunier et al., 2009) or by replacing the mean with some more appropriate functions. For this purpose, Rudin (2009) has introduced the Infinite Push loss function\nL(f(·), S)∞ = max j\n∑\ni\nIf(x+ i )≤f(x− j ) (1)\nwhich gets smaller as the negative example with highest score is assigned a small score.

We can mention for instance the relaxation by means of exponential loss that yield to boosting-like algorithm (Rudin, 2009). If Hinge loss is used as a convex relaxation then we get the following Support Vector like optimization problem :\nmin w λΩ(w) + max 1≤j≤n\n(\n1\nm\nm ∑\ni=1\n( 1−w⊤(x+i − x − j ) )\n+\n)\n(2) where Ω(w) is some regularization term and the function (u)+ = u if u > 0 and 0 otherwise.\nFor Ω(w) = λ2 ‖w‖ 2, Agarwal has proposed an algorithm for solving the dual of this problem, which is :\nmin αi,j\n1\n2\n∑\ni,j\n∑\nk,l\nαi,jαk,l(x + i − x − j ) ⊤(x+k − x − l )−\n∑\ni,j\nαi,j\nst ∑ j maxi(αi,j) ≤ 1 λm\nαi,j ≥ 0 (3)\nwhich has smooth quadratic objective function under some mixed-norm constraints over the dual variables αi,j . The algorithm is based on a nice and clever gradient projection algorithm (Agarwal, 2011).\nIn this paper, we focus our effort on this support vector infinite push problem and propose a novel optimization algorithm for solving it when Ω(w) is some non-differentiable sparsity-inducing regularizer so as to perform feature selection in a top-ranking learning problem. For this purpose, we investigate an algorithm that directly solves the primal problem in Equation (2).\nHowever, before delving into the details of the algorithm, we discuss, in what follows the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the primal problem (2) based on some classical results on convex analysis:\nProposition 1. (a) For any convex regularization term Ω(w) that is lower semi-continuous and and coercive, problem (2) admits at least one solution. (b) For any strictly convex, lower semi continuous and coercive regularization term, problem (2) admits an unique solution.\nWe omit the proof of these two propositions since they are rather direct consequences of some well known results on the minimization of composite non-smooth functions (Combettes & Pesquet, 2007). Instead, we prefer to bring to light some properties of the primal problem compared to the dual one that are consequences of these propositions :\nAn interesting point is that for Ω(w) = λ2 ‖w‖ 2, point 2 of the proposition guarantees uniqueness of solution since Ω satisfies all required properties. Conversely, when considering the dual problem (3) as in Agarwal (2011), this property may be lost. Indeed, it can be easily shown that when the dimensionality of the problem d is smaller than m ·n, the Hessian of the dual objective function is only positive semi-definite. We remark that even for small-scale high-dimensional learning problem, the condition d < m · n can be rapidly reached making optimization in the primal theoretically more sound.\nUniqueness of the solution for ℓ1 norms or mixednorms are more involved and we have left these analyses for future works."

However, the presence of the design matrix will add some linear constraint on the problem, making it easier to address through an ADMM framework. For this purpose, we rewrite the optimization problem (2) as the following linearly-constrained problem :\nmin w,a\nΩ(w) + max 1≤j≤n\n(\n1\nm\n∑\ni\n(ai,j)+\n)\nai,j = 1−w T (x+i − x − j )\n(4)\nwhere Ω(w) can be any sparsity inducing norm like the ℓ1 norm, any mixed-norm (Bach et al., 2011) or the classical ℓ2 regularization term. Then, by properly defining the matrix X (which rows are of the form (x+i − x − j ) T ), the vector a and the function g(a) = maxj ( 1 m ∑ i max(ai,j , 0) )\nwe yield the following reformulation :\nmin w,a Ω(w) + g(a)\nXw + a− 1 = 0 (5)\nThe augmented Lagrangian related to this problem is\nL(w,a, δ, µ) = Ω(w) + g(a) + δ⊤(Xw + a− 1) +µ2 ‖Xw + a− 1‖ 2\nwhere δ is a vector of Lagrangian multipliers related to the equality constraint and µ is a parameter weighting the quadratic penalty. After rearranging the terms, one can show that the augmented Lagrangian is\nL(w,a, γ) = Ω(w) + g(a) + µ2 ‖Xw + a− 1+ γ‖ 2\nwhere γ = δ µ . The alternating direction method of multipliers that solves our original problem (4) looks for a saddle point of the augmented Lagrangian by solving alternatively at iteration k the following problems :\nwk+1 = argmin w L(w,ak, γk) (6)\nak+1 = argmin a L(wk+1,a, γk) (7) γk+1 = γk +Xwk+1 + ak+1 − 1 (8)\nAll the challenges of the algorithm now resides essentially in the resolution of these problems."

Depending on the Lasso algorithm used, one can highly benefit from warm-starting the solution since between two consecutive ADMM iteration, the second member s is not expected to vary a lot.\nFor the ℓ2 norm regularizer, the solution has a closedform solution\nwk+1 = (X⊤X+ λ\nµ I)−1(X⊤s)\nIn some situations, when the dimensionality of the problem is large, it may be more efficient to numerically solve this linear system by means of a conjugate gradient descent approach."

      "text" : "Now supposing that w and the Lagrangian multipliers γ are fixed in the Lagrangian, the optimization problem related to (7) boils down to be :\nak+1 = argmin a\ng(a) + µ\n2 ‖a− s‖22 (9)\nwith s being 1 − γk − Xwk+1. We note that by definition, ak+1 is the result of 1\nµ g(·) proximal operator\napplied to the vector s (Combettes & Pesquet, 2010). Now, let us look into more details at this problem. The most challenging part of it comes from the two nested max functions defining g(·). In order to overcome part of the issues, we propose to use the doubling trick and rewrites the minimization problem as :\nmin a +,a−\n1 2‖a + − a− − s‖22 +maxj\n(\n1 mµ\n∑ i a + )\nst a+ ≥ 0,a− ≥ 0 (10) with a = a+ − a−. Now, since the regularization term and the constraints are decoupled in a+ and a−, we suggest to solve problem (10) by means a of blockcoordinate descent (BCD) algorithm that starts from\nsome positive random vectors and alternatively optimize over a+ then a− keeping the other vector fixed. Before providing algorithmic details, we state here a proposition based on the work of Tseng (2001) that guarantees the soundness of the BCD algorithm.\nProposition 2. Let us define f0(a +,a−) = 12‖a + − a− − s‖22, f1(a +) = maxj ( 1 mµ ∑ i a + ) + I a +≥0, f2(a −) = I a −≥0, the sequence generates by the BCD method by alternatively optimizing over a+ and a− converges towards the minimum of Problem 10.\nProof. It is easy to see that the objective function f(a+,a−) of Problem 10 is f(a+,a−) = f0(a\n+,a−) + f1(a +,a−) + f2(a +,a−). Besides, f0 is continuous on its domain and coercive, f(·, ·) is convex with respect to any of its parameter with the other fixed and the functions fi(·),i = {0, 1, 2} are lower semi-continuous. Owing to all these properties, applying Theorem 5.1 of Tseng (2001) concludes the proof.\nNow, we are interested in solving each coordinate descent of Equation (10). When considering minimizing over a− with a+ fixed, the problem is rather simple since it boils down to be a projection of −s + a+ on the positive quadrant. Hence, we have the following closed-form solution for each component of a− :\na−k =\n{\n−sk + a + k if − sk + a + k ≥ 0 0 otherwise\nWe can now focus on the other alternate problem\nmin a +\n1 2‖a + − b‖22 +maxj\n(\n1 mµ\n∑\ni∈Gi a+i\n)\nst a+ ≥ 0\nwith b = a− + s and Gi being the indices of elements of a coupling the negative example xj with positive examples. Interestingly, owing to the positiveness of a+ and by replacing the constraint in the objective value this problem is equivalent to\nmin a +\n1 2‖a + − b‖22 +maxj\n(\n1 mµ\n∑\ni∈Gi |a+i |\n)\n+ I a +≥0\n(11)\nWe can note here that the solution of this problem occurs at\na+⋆ = proxI·≥0+Ω†(b)\nwith I·≥0 being the indicator on the positive quadrant and Ω†(u) = maxj ( 1 mµ ∑ i∈Gi |u+i | ) which is a mixed ℓ∞ − ℓ1 norm on u. The proximal operator proxI·≥0+Ω(b) is non-trivial and needs to be computed numerically. For this purpose, we have applied a Douglas-Rachford algorithm which can handle the\nminimization of the sum of two non-smooth convex functions f1 and f2. The following proposition makes this explicit :\nProposition 3. (Combettes & Pesquet, 2010) Let f1 and f2 be two convex lower semi-continuous functions of Rd such that the intersection of their domain relative interiors is not empty and such that f1(·) + f2(·) is coercive. Set v0 ∈ R d and build un for n ≥ 0 as\nun = proxγf2(vn) vn+1 = vn + η ( proxγf1(2un − vn)− un) ) (12)\nwith γ > 0 and η ∈]0, 2[, then every sequence {un} generated by this algorithm converges towards a minimizer of f1 + f2.\nHence, a direct application of this algorithm to our problem given in Equation (11) with f2(v) = 1 2‖v − b‖22 + Iv≥0 and f1(v) = maxj ( 1 mµ ∑ i∈Gi |vi| ) leads to the minimizer of Equation (11). Now the remaining question is : what are the proximal operators of γf1 and γf2?\nFor γf2, we have to solve the problem\nproxγf2(vn) = argmin z\n1 2 ‖z−vn‖ 2 2+ γ 2 ‖z−b‖22+ Iz≥0\nwhich solution can be easily proven to be\nproxγf2(vn) = PC\n(\nvn + γb\n1 + γ\n)\nwith PC being the projection on the positive quadrant. Now, regarding γf1, we look for\nproxγf1(v) = argmin z\n1 2 ‖z−v‖22+ γ mµ max j\n(\n∑\ni∈Gi\n|zi|\n)\n(13) which is the proximal operator of a ℓ∞ − ℓ1 mixed norm. For solving this problem, we use classical result from convex analysis and proximal operator (Combettes & Wajs, 2005; Sra, 2011), which states that the proximal operator of a norm ‖ · ‖ is\nproxτ‖·‖(u) = u−Π‖·‖∗≤τ (u)\nwith Π‖·‖∗≤τ (u) being the projection of u on the τ - radius ball of the dual norm ‖ · ‖∗. Then, since the dual norm of ℓ∞ − ℓ1 norm is the ℓ1 − ℓ∞ norm, we have\nproxγf1(v) = v −Π‖·‖1,∞≤ γmµ (v) (14)\nThis problem is easily tractable since projection of vector on a ℓ1 − ∞ ball has been recently studied and several efficient algorithms proposed (Quattoni et al., 2009; Sra, 2011).\nAlgorithm 1 ADMM approach for primal infinite push.\n1: Input : X : matrix of pairwise difference of examples, λ regularization term 2: set µ > 0, k = 0 3: initialize ak and γk to vectors of 0. 4: repeat 5: s = 1− ak − γk 6: wk+1 = argminw 1 2‖Xw − s‖ 2 2 + λΩ(w) 7: s = 1− γk −Xwk+1 8: set a+ = 0 and a− = 0 9: repeat\n10: a− = max(−s+ a+, 0) 11: set b = a− + s and v0 = 0 12: repeat 13: un = 1 1+γ max(vn + γb, 0) 14: vn+1 = vn+η(un−vn−Π‖·‖1,∞(2un−vn)) 15: until convergence is met 16: a+ = un 17: until convergence is met 18: ak+1 = a+ − a− 19: γk+1 = γt +Xwk+1 + ak+1 − 1 20: k ← k + 1 21: until condition"

Indeed, a direct application of Theorem 8 in that paper tells us that our algorithm converges for any µ > 0, as long as the matrix X has full column rank (condition that is satisfied by most non-degenerate problems for which d < m · n) and that the computation errors of problem (6) and problem (7) are summable.

This infinite push RFE bears strong resemblance with the backward elimination of Geng et al. (2007). For a baseline comparison, we have also included an ℓ1 SVM Rank.\nThe toy problem is a binary classification problem in R\nd with evenly distributed classes. Among these d variables, only r of them define a subspace of Rd in which classes can be discriminated. For these r relevant variables, the two classes follow a Gaussian pdf with mean respectively µ and −µ and covariance matrices randomly drawn from a Wishart distribution. µ has been randomly drawn from {−1,+1}r. The other d − r non-relevant variables follow an i.i.d Gaussian probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance for both classes. We have respectively sampled n and nt number of examples for training and testing. For some experiments, n is varying, but we have always set nt = 1000. Before learning, the training set has been normalized to zero mean and unit variance and the test sets have been rescaled accordingly.

We can also remark that unlike the infinite push approach, SVM Rank does not necessarily improve its performances on the top as the number of examples increases. This is unsurprising as SVM Rank aims at optimizing average ranking.\nFigure 2 depicts the precision and the F-measure of the different algorithms for retrieving the true variables. We remark that the RFE infinite push performs very good with respects to the F-measure. However, the use of the ℓ1 norm yields to a better precision : more relevant variables are selected at the expense of selecting some irrelevant ones. This is a well known issue of the ℓ1 norm that can be overcome using an adaptive approach (Zou, 2006).\nAn empirical illustration of the computational complexity of our algorithm as well as the one of a sparse\nSVM Rank is reported in Figure 3.

We leverage the issues related to this challenging optimization problem by considering an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm which is built upon proximal operators of the loss function and the regularizer. Our main technical contribution is thus to provide a numerical scheme for computing the infinite push loss function proximal operator. Experimental results on toy, DNA microarray and BCI problems show how our novel algorithm compares favorably to competitors for ranking on top while using fewer variables in the scoring function.",
