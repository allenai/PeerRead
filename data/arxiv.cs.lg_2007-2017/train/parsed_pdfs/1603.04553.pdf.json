In this paper, we propose a generative, unsupervised ranking model for entity coreference resolution by introducing resolution mode variables. Our unsupervised system achieves 58.44% F1 score of the CoNLL metric on the English data from the CoNLL2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012), outperforming the Stanford deterministic system (Lee et al., 2013) by 3.01%."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Entity coreference resolution has become a critical component for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Systems requiring deep language understanding, such as information extraction (Wellner et al., 2004), semantic event learning (Chambers and Jurafsky, 2008; Chambers and Jurafsky, 2009), and named entity linking (Durrett and Klein, 2014; Ji et al., 2014) all benefit from entity coreference information.\nEntity coreference resolution is the task of identifying mentions (i.e., noun phrases) in a text or dialogue that refer to the same real-world entities. In recent years, several supervised entity coreference resolution systems have been proposed, which, according to Ng (2010), can be categorized into three classes — mentionpair models (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995), entity-mention models (Yang et al., 2008a;\nHaghighi and Klein, 2010; Lee et al., 2011) and ranking models (Yang et al., 2008b; Durrett and Klein, 2013; Fernandes et al., 2014) — among which ranking models recently obtained state-of-the-art performance. However, the manually annotated corpora that these systems rely on are highly expensive to create, in particular when we want to build data for resourcepoor languages (Ma and Xia, 2014). That makes unsupervised approaches, which only require unannotated text for training, a desirable solution to this problem.\nSeveral unsupervised learning algorithms have been applied to coreference resolution. Haghighi and Klein (2007) presented a mentionpair nonparametric fully-generative Bayesian model for unsupervised coreference resolution. Based on this model, Ng (2008) probabilistically induced coreference partitions via EM clustering. Poon and Domingos (2008) proposed an entity-mention model that is able to perform joint inference across mentions by using Markov Logic. Unfortunately, these unsupervised systems’ performance on accuracy significantly falls behind those of supervised systems, and are even worse than the deterministic rule-based systems. Furthermore, there is no previous work exploring the possibility of developing an unsupervised ranking model which achieved state-of-the-art performance under supervised settings for entity coreference resolution.\nIn this paper, we propose an unsupervised generative ranking model for entity coreference resolution. Our experimental results on the English data from the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012)\nshow that our unsupervised system outperforms the Stanford deterministic system (Lee et al., 2013) by 3.01% absolute on the CoNLL official metric. The contributions of this work are (i) proposing the first unsupervised ranking model for entity coreference resolution. (ii) giving empirical evaluations of this model on benchmark data sets. (iii) considerably narrowing the gap to supervised coreference resolution accuracy."

The method to detect and extract these mentions is discussed later in Section 2.6. Let C = {c1, c2, . . . , cn} denote the coreference assignment of a given document, where each mention mi has an associated random variable ci taking values in the set {0, i, . . . , i − 1}; this variable specifies mi’s selected antecedent (ci ∈ {1, 2, . . . , i − 1}), or indicates that it begins a new coreference chain (ci = 0)."

This independent assumption is similar to that in the IBM 1 model on machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where it assumes that given the corresponding English word, the aligned foreign word is independent with other English and foreign words. We do not make any independent assumptions among different features (see Section 2.4 for details).\nInference in this model is efficient, because we\ncan compute cj separately for each mention:\nc∗j = argmax cj P (mj|mcj )P (cj |j)\nThe model is a so-called ranking model because it is able to identify the most probable candidate antecedent given a mention to be resolved."

      "heading" : "2.3 Resolution Mode Variables",
      "text" : "According to previous work (Haghighi and Klein, 2009; Ratinov and Roth, 2012; Lee et al., 2013), antecedents are resolved by different categories of information for different mentions. For example, the Stanford system (Lee et al., 2013) uses string-matching sieves to link two mentions with similar text and precise-construct sieve to link two mentions which satisfy special syntactic or semantic relations such as apposition or acronym. Motivated by this, we introduce resolution mode variables Π = {π1, . . . , πn}, where for each mention j the variable πj ∈ {str, prec, attr} indicates in which mode the mention should be resolved. In our model, we define three resolution modes — string-matching (str), precise-construct (prec), and attribute-matching (attr) — and Π is deterministic when D is given (i.e. P (Π|D) is a point distribution). We determine πj for each mention mj in the following way:\n• πj = str, if there exists a mention mi, i < j such that the two mentions satisfy the String Match sieve, the Relaxed String Match sieve, or the Strict Head Match A sieve in the Stanford multi-sieve system (Lee et al., 2013).\n• πj = prec, if there exists a mention mi, i < j such that the two mentions satisfy the Speaker Identification sieve, or the Precise Constructs sieve.\n• πj = attr, if there is no mention mi, i < j satisfies the above two conditions.\nNow, we can extend the generative model in Eq. 1 to:\nP (D,C) = P (D,C,Π)\n= n ∏\nj=1 P (mj|mcj , πj)P (cj |πj, j)P (πj |j)\nwhere we define P (πj |j) to be uniform distribution. We model P (mj |mcj , πj) and P (cj |πj, j) in the following way:\nP (mj |mcj , πj) = t(mj|mcj , πj)\nP (cj |πj , j) =\n{\nq(cj |πj , j) πj = attr 1 j otherwise\nwhere θ = {t, q} are parameters of our model. Note that in the attribute-matching mode (πj = attr) we model P (cj |πj, j) with parameter q, while in the other two modes, we use the uniform distribution. It makes sense because the position information is important for coreference resolved by matching attributes of two mentions such as resolving pronoun coreference, but not that important for those resolved by matching text or special relations like two mentions referring the same person and matching by the name."

Our model outperforms the three baseline systems on all the evaluation metrics.

The improvements on CoNLL F1 score over the Multigraph model are 1.41% and 1.77% on the development and test sets, respectively. Comparing with the MIR model, we obtain significant improvements of 2.62% and 3.02% on CoNLL F1 score.\nTo make a thorough empirical comparison with previous studies, Table 3 (below the dashed line) also shows the results of some state-of-the-art supervised coreference resolution systems — IMS: the second best system in the CoNLL 2012 shared task (Björkelund and Farkas, 2012); Latent-Tree: the latent tree model (Fernandes et al., 2012) obtaining the best results in the shared task; Berkeley: the Berkeley system with the final feature set (Durrett and Klein, 2013); LaSO: the structured perceptron system with nonlocal features (Björkelund and Kuhn, 2014); Latent-Strc: the latent structure system (Martschat and Strube, 2015); Model-Stack: the entity-centric system with model stacking (Clark and Manning, 2015); and Non-Linear: the non-linear mention-ranking model with feature representations (Wiseman et al., 2015).
