      "text" : "As deep networks started to achieve state-of-the-art results on many computer vision tasks, increasing the depth of models without compromising its training has become a central problem to machine learning (Larochelle et al. (2009)).\nMany problems challenge the training of neural networks, including vanishing/exploding gradients (Bengio et al. (1994)), saturating activation functions (Xu et al. (2016)) and poor weight initialization (Glorot & Bengio (2010)). Techniques such as unsupervised pre-training (Bengio et al. (2007)), nonsaturating activation functions (Nair & Hinton (2010)) and normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy (2015)) target these issues and enable the training of deeper networks. However, stacking more than a dozen layers still remained an open problem.\nRecently, models such as Residual Networks (He et al. (2015b)) and Highway Neural Networks (Srivastava et al. (2015)) permitted the design of networks with hundreds of layers, also providing significant improvements on computer vision tasks. Although different in design, Highway and Residual networks share the idea of free information flow through layers: shortcut connections make optimization easier due to a shorter path between the lower layers and the network’s error function.\nOn the theoretical side, it is suggested that depth contributes exponentially more to the representational capacity of networks than width (Eldan & Shamir (2015) Telgarsky (2016) Bianchini & Scarselli (2014) Montúfar et al. (2014)). This agrees with the increasing depth of winning architectures on challenges such as ImageNet (He et al. (2015b) Szegedy et al. (2014)). He et al. (2015b) showed that, by construction, one can increase a network’s depth while preserving its performance – therefore retaining the best local minimum. These two observations indicate that it suffices to stack more layers to a network in order to increase its performance. The fact that this is not observed in practice is an indication that the effect of depth on optimization is not well understood.\nInspired by the importance of skip-connection in Highway and Residual Networks, in this work we introduce the notion of degeneration capacity – an attempt to measure how easily layers can degenerate into identity mappings.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n01 26\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 4\nN ov\n2 01\nWe define a metric called Squared Distance To Identity (SDI), which captures the distance in the parameter surface corresponding to learning identity functions. It is defined as the squared elementwise distance between parameter sets W and Ŵ , where a layer with parameter set Ŵ is equivalent to the identity function.\nBased on this metric, we develop a technique to augment network layers that enables identity mappings to be learned by optimizing only one parameter. This results in degeneration being simpler and less dependent on the layer’s size. As the effective depth of a network quickly decreases if necessary, depth becomes less damaging to the optimizer.\nBy shortening the distance between layers and identity mappings, we also hope to strengthen the supervision on lower layers, aiding the network optimization by making gradients flow more smoothly.\nThe augmentation is defined as, given a layer u = f(x,W ) as input, generating u = g(k)f(x,W )+ (1 − g(k))x as illustrated in Figure 1. Here u is the layer’s output, x its input, and k is a scalar parameter, and not a tensor as in Highway Networks. We show that this simplification of Highway\nlayers increases performance, decreases dependency between layers and provides an easy method to prune layers from a network.\nWe augment Residual Networks – the current standard architecture for computer vision tasks – resulting in a layer u = g(k)fr(x,W ) + x, where fr denotes a residual unit. As shown in Figure 2, the shortcut connection suffers no processing through the layer.\nLastly, we show how sparse encoding (Glorot et al. (2011)) can be applied to augmented layers: transposing the sparsity from neurons to layers provides a form to prune them entirely from the network. We show that, unlike residual layers, their augmented counterparts retain good performance after more than half of its layers have been completely removed.\nWe present results on two experiments. First, we test augmented fully-connected residual networks on MNIST, showing performance increase and how layer pruning affects the model. Second, we augment Wide ResNets (Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016)) and test them on CIFAR-10, observing indications that our method can be used to surpass state-of-the-art results.\nOur findings indicate that layer degeneration is a fundamental aspect of learning in deep networks, and designing models with this capability seems highly effective."

      "text" : "A network’s depth can always be increased without affecting its performance – it suffices to add layers that perform identity mappings. Consider a classic fully-connected ReLU network with layers defined as u = ReLU(〈x,W 〉). When adding a new layer, we initialize W as the identity matrix I . The layer becomes u = ReLU(〈x, I〉) = ReLU(x) = x. The last step holds since x is an output of a previous ReLU layer, and ReLU(ReLU(x)) = ReLU(x). Figure 3 illustrates this idea.\nTherefore, we can always add as many layers as desired to a network without harming its performance. This conforms with the hypothesis that depth is mostly an issue to the non-convex nature\nof the optimization. It also suggests that if layers could quickly become identity mappings, then stacking more layers would have less negative impact on the model’s optimization.\nTo compare Highway and Residual networks, we inspect how easily layers in each model can become identity mappings – we call this property the model’s degeneration capacity. To degenerate into an identity mapping, a layer’s parameters have to change from a state W to another state Ŵ defined by u(x, Ŵ ) = x.\nA comparison of how W changes to Ŵ in each model requires knowledge on the steps taken by the optimizer in the cost surface. Given a path formed by such steps, its length can be calculated to measure how quickly the network learns identity mappings. However, the gradient steps change according to the optimization technique, the ordering of data points, the pre-processing, and so on.\nAlternatively, assume that the squared parameter-wise distance between W and Ŵ is a credible surrogate to the path’s length. This measure, named Squared Distance to Identity (SDI), serves as a tool to investigate why Highway and Residual networks can be severely deeper than previous models.\nWe define it for the weight parameters as:\nSDI(W ) =M = E [ (W − Ŵ )2 ] (1)\nAnd for the bias, as:\nSDI(b) = B = E [ (b− b̂)2 ] (2)\nThe expected value is due to the parameters’ random initialization.\nThrough this section, we always assume thatW is a n×nmatrix and b an n-dimensional vector. The same definition holds for higher order tensors, for example when analyzing convolutional networks.\nThe sum of all elements inM andB can be calculated for a lower bound on the squared path length. We call it Total Squared Distance to Identity (TSDI):\nTSDI = n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 Mij + n∑ i=1 Bi (3)"

      "text" : "Highway and Residual networks differ from classical networks on the composition of theM matrix. For the latter, each neuron’s parameters – a row in the W matrix – have to achieve a different state. This property is also observed in the M matrix: elements in its diagonal are different from the rest.\nEach neuron receives error backpropagated from upper layers, therefore have no information on the behavior of other neurons in its layer. These two facts indicate that degeneration in classical layers require coordination between neurons in the same layer, even though they don’t communicate directly.\nConversely, all elements in M for Highway and Residual networks are equal, thus no coordination is required to learn an identity mapping. For the B vector, all elements are equal for the three types of network.\nA comparison of the Total Squared Distance to Identity shows that Residual Networks have the smallest value out of the three networks. It is also observed that Highway Networks can’t fully degenerate by learning Wt and bt, but states close to degeneration are achievable.\nThis analyzis indicates that uniform degeneration states – all elements in Ŵ and b̂ being equal – and small values for TSDI help the learning of identity mappings. Therefore, these properties can prove advantageous when designing deep networks."

      "text" : "The SDI of classical, Highway and Residual models suggests that an uniform M and B with small values provides easier optimization for deep networks. Ideally, a layer should have a constant SDI, since it guarantees that its degeneration capacity is not affected by its size.\nHaving all elements in M and B to be equal removes the need of coordination between a layer’s neurons when degenerating into an identity mapping. Since it is not known how Ŵ ’s dimensionality affects its degeneration capacity – other than how increased dimension impacts it negatively – keeping it to a minimum might also be advantageous.\nWe thus propose adding scalar gates to a layer. More specifically, a layer u = f(x,W ) becomes u = g(k)f(x,W ) + (1− g(k))x, where k is a scalar parameter. Such layer can quickly degenerate by setting g(k) to 0. Using the ReLU activation function as g, it suffices that k ≤ 0 for g(k) = 0. This simplified version of Highway layers as an augmentation technique provides a constant degeneration capacity of SDI(k) = E[(k− 0)2] = E[k2]. A deterministic initialization of k as kinit sets each augmented layer’s TSDI to k2init.\nUnlike in the previously analyzed models, degeneration can occur by learning only one parameter. For fully-connected and convolutional networks, the number of parameters to be learned are O(n2) – where for convolutional layers, n stands for the number of feature maps, ignoring the fixed kernel sizes.\nWe use Residual layers as basis for the augmentation for two reasons. First, they are the current standard for computer vision tasks. Second, ResNets lack means to regulate the residuals, therefore a linear gating mechanism might not only allow deeper models, but could also improve performance.\nWe can rewrite a residual layer as follows:\nu = f(x,W ) = fr(x,W ) + x\nWhere fr(x,W ) is the layer’s residual function – in our case, BN-ReLU-Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv. Augmenting this layer by adding the scalar gates yields:\nu = g(k)f(x,W ) + (1− g(k))x = g(k)(fr(x,W ) + x) + (1− g(k))x = g(k)fr(x,W ) + x\nThe augmentation maintains the shortcut connection unaltered, which according to He et al. (2016) is a desired property when designing residual blocks. As (1− g(k)) vanishes from the formulation, g(k) stops acting as a dual gating mechanism and can be interpreted as a flow regulator. We call this model Gated Residual Network or GResNet through the paper.\nFor g(k) > 1, the residual signal fr(x,W ) is amplified and the shortcut connection loses significance when generating the layer’s output. On the other hand, 0 < g(k) < 1 suppresses the residual, increasing the shortcut connection’s importance. States where k < 0 result in g(k) = 0, producing an identity mapping."

We trained three types of fully-connected models: classical plain networks, ResNets and GResNets.\nThe networks consist of a linear layer with 50 neurons, followed by d layers with 50 neurons each, and lastly a softmax layer for classification. Only the d middle layers differ between the three architectures – the first linear layer and the softmax layer are the same in all experiments.\nFor plain networks, each layer performs dot product, followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation function.\nInitial tests with pre-activations (He et al. (2016)) resulted in poor performance on the validation set, therefore we opted for the traditional Dot-BN-ReLU layer when designing Residual Networks. Identity shortcut connections connected every 2 layers, as conventional.\nAll networks were trained using Adam (Kingma & Ba (2014)) with Nesterov momentum (Dozat) for a total of 100 epochs using mini-batches of size 128. No learning rate decay was used: we kept the learning rate and momentum fixed to 0.002 and 0.9 during the whole training.\nFor pre processing, we divided each pixel value by 255, constraining their values to [0, 1].\nThe training curves for classical plain networks, ResNets and GResNets with varying depth are shown in figure 4. The distance between the curves increase with the depth, showing that the augmentation helps the training of deeper models.\nTable 2 shows the test error for each depth and architecture. ResNets converge in experiments with d = 50 and d = 100 (52 and 102 layers, respectively), while classical models do not.\nGated Residual Networks perform better in all settings, and the performance boost is more noticeable with increased depths. The relative error decreased approximately 2.5% for d = {2, 10, 20}, 8.7% for d = 50 and 16% for d = 100.\nAs observed in table 3, the mean values of k decrease as the model gets deeper, showing that shortcut connections have less impact on shallow networks. This agrees with empirical results that ResNets perform better than plain networks as the depth increases.\nWe also analyzed how layer removal affects ResNets and GResNets. We compared how the deepest networks (d = 100) behave as residual units – consecutive pairs of layers between shortcut connections – are completely removed from the models.\nResults are shown in Figure 5. For Gated Residual Networks, we prune pairs of layers following two strategies. One consists of pruning layers in a greedy fashion, where units with the smallest k are removed first. In the other we remove units randomly. We present results using both strategies for GResNets, and only random pruning for ResNets since they lack the k parameter.\nThe greedy strategy is slightly better for Gated Residual Networks, showing that the k parameter is indeed a good indicator of a layer’s importance for the model, but that layers tend to assume the same level of significance. In a fair comparison, where both models are pruned randomly, GResNets retain a satisfactory performance even after half of its layers have been removed, while ResNets suffer performance decrease after just a few layers.\nTherefore augmented models are not only more robust to layer removal, but can have a fair share of their layers pruned and still perform well. Faster predictions can be generated by using a pruned version of an original model."

By designing our method such that randomly initialized layers are always close to identity mappings, models are more robust to depth after augmentation.\nWe have shown that augmenting ResNets yield a model that can regulate the residuals, which we named Gated Residual Networks. This model performed better in all our experiments, and we believe that it can be used to surpass the state-of-the-art on benchmark tasks with negligible extra training time and parameters.

    "abstractText" : "We propose a technique to augment network layers by adding a linear gating mechanism, which provides a way to learn identity mappings by optimizing only one parameter. We also introduce a new metric which served as basis for the technique. It captures the difficulty involved in learning identity mappings for different types of network models, and provides a new theoretical intuition for the increased depths of models such as Highway and Residual Networks. We propose a new model, the Gated Residual Network, which is the result when augmenting Residual Networks. Experimental results show that augmenting layers grants increased performance, less issues with depth, and more layer independence – fully removing them does not cripple the model. We evaluate our method on MNIST using fully-connected networks and on CIFAR-10 using Wide ResNets, achieving a relative error reduction of more than 8% in the latter when compared to the original model.",
