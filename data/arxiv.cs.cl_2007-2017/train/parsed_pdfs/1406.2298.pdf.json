      "text" : "The growth in size and complexity of computer systems has been accompanied by an increase in importance given to the application of verification techniques, attempting to avoid or at least mitigate problems arising due to errors in the system design and implementation. Given a specification of how the system should behave (or, dually, of what the system should not do), techniques ranging from testing to runtime verification and model checking attempt to answer the question of whether or not the system is correct. One common issue with all these techniques, is that a negative answer is useless unless accompanied by a trace showing how the system may perform leading to a violation of the expected behaviour.\nConsider, for example, the specification of a system which allows user to log in, as shown in Figure 1, which states that “after three consecutive failed user authentications, users should not be allowed to attempt another login”. A testing or runtime verification tool may deduce that the system may perform a long sequence of events which lead to a violation. Although techniques have been developed to shorten such counter-examples [ZH02], such traces may be rather long, and using them to understand the circumstances in which the system failed to work as expected may not always be straightforward.\nIn the case of implementation-level properties and traces, tools such as debuggers and simulators may enable the processing of long traces by developers to understand the nature of the bug, but in the case of higher-level specifications, giving businesslogic level properties, such traces may need to be processed by management personnel. For example, a fraud expert may be developing fraud rules to try to match against the\nbehaviour of known black-listed users, and may want to understand why a trace showing the behaviour of such a user does to trigger a rule he may have just set up. In such cases, a natural language explanation of such a trace would help the expert to understand better what is going wrong and why.\nIn this paper, we present the use of finite state natural language generation (NLG) models to explain violation traces. We assume that the basis of the controlled natural language used to describe such behaviour is given by the person writing the specification, by articulating how the actions can be described using a natural language, and how they can be abstracted into more understandable explanations.We present a stepwise refinement of the process, explaining how a more natural feel to the generated controlled natural language text can be given using finite state techniques.\nAlthough the work we present is still exploratory, we believe that the approach can be generalised to work on more complex systems, and it can give insight into how far out the limits of finite state NLG techniques can be pushed."

      "heading" : "2 The Roles of NLG and CNL",
      "text" : "In this section we illustrate a solution to the problem of generating reasonably natural explanations from sequences of the above type in a computationally efficient way. The two critical ingredients are (i) NLG, which, in a general sense, provides a set of techniques for generating text flexibly given an abstract non-linguistic representation of\nsemantic content, and (ii) CNLs which, in a nutshell, are natural languages with a designer element — natural in the sense that they can be understood by native speakers of the “parent” language and designed to to be simpler than that language from some computational perspective such as translation to logic or, as in this paper, NLG. An excellent survey and classification scheme for CNLs appears in Kuhn [Kuh14]\nThe final output of NLG is clearly natural language of some kind. The nature of the process that produces that output is somewhat less clear, in that there are still many approaches though most research in the area is consistent with the assumption that that it includes at least the stages of content planning (decidingwhat to say), content packaging (packaging the content into sentence-sizedmessages), and surface realisation (constructing individual sentences). These three stages are linked together in a pipeline, according to the architecture proposed by Reiter and Dale [RD00].\nThe complexity of NLG arises from fact that the input content severely underdetermines the surface realisation and that there are few guiding principles available to narrow the realisation choices. Consequently, the process is even more nondeterministic than the inverse process of of natural language understandingwhere at least it is possible to appeal to common sense when attempting to choose amongst competing interpretations.With NLG, some dimensions of complexitymust be sacrificed for the computation to be feasible.\nIn this paper, the sacrifice comes down to a choice concerning two sets of languages: (i) that which expresses the content, which we will call the C language, and (ii) a sequence of languages in which explanations are realised that we will callE1,E2, etc.C is a form of semantic representation language, whilst E1, E2, . . . En are CNLs in Kuhn’s sense.\nIn both cases, we assume that bothC andEi languages are regular languages in the formal sense. This has a number of advantages: the computational properties of such languages are well understood, and we know that algorithms for parsing and generation of are of relatively low complexity. Additionally, we can express linguistic processes as relations over such languages that can be computed by finite-state transducers. Elementary transductions can be composed together to carry out complex linguistic processing tasks. Using techniques originally advocated for morphological analysis by Beesley and Kattunen [BK03] we can envisage a complex NLG process as a series of finite state transductions combined together under relational composition, thus opening up the possibility of describing the synthesis of an explanation to efficient, finite-state machinery.\nOf course, the restriction to regular languages imposes certain limitations upon what content can possibly be expressed in C, and may also impact the naturalness of the violation description expressed in E. However, these are empirical issues that will not be tackled in this paper\nWe are not the first to have used simplified languages in the attempt to reduce the complexity of natural language processing. In the domain of NLG, Wilcock [Wil01] proposed “the use of XML-based tools to implement existing well-known approaches to NLG”. Power [Pow12] uses finite-state representations for expressing descriptions of OWL-LITE sentences. It is of course in the area of computational morphology where finite state methods are best known.\nThe main contribution of the paper is to substantiate and present the hypothesis that according to the choice of C and E, it is possible to realise a family of efficient NLG systems that are based on steadfastly finite-state technology."

Since these are all CNLs we will refer to them as CNL0, CNL1, CNL2 and CNL3 respectively. All four languages are similar insofar as they all talk about the same underlying, domain-specific world of states and actions, and they all finite state.

The lexicon itself is expressed as a finite state transducer, as described in Section 4.1. For more complex systems such an approach might not be practical, and a solution could then be to derive the sentence associated with each transition from more fundamental properties of the underlying machine.\nCNL0 provides for a somewhat naïve explanation of traces using the explanations\nprovided by the domain expert directly."

The main feature of CNL1 is that it is a sequence of paragraphs, where each paragraph is simply a sequence of CNL0 sentences, as shown in Figure 4\nThere are two consequences to this slightly richer structure. One is that it provides the skeleton upon which to hang the numbered steps. This is a presentation issue that arguably increases the naturalness and improves comprehension. The other is that it gives a structural identity to each paragraph that could be exploited in order to attribute certain semantic properties to the associated sequence of actions. For example, we have the notion of correctnesswhich has the potential to figure in explanations. Nevertheless, this property is not actually exploited in CNL1."

Because the transducer that achieves this uses the paragraph marker to identify the final fullstop, we must first insert that final paragraph marker as as shown in B. The next two phases of aggregation are best explained with the following example: we wish to transform “the user requested to login. the user gave a good password. the user logged out.” to the more natural “the user requested login, gave a good password, and logged out”. The first phase removes the subject (i.e. the phrase “ the user”) of all sentences but reinstates the same subject at the beginning of the paragraph. The second inserts an “and\" just before the final verb phrase of each aggregated sentence. In this way we are able to achieve paragraph 2 of the CNL2 example as shown in Figure Similar, surface-oriented techniques can be used to obtain the other paragraphs in Figure 5.

Consecutive correct failed login attempts: (lb)n explained as “The user unsuccessfully attempted to log in n times”. Correct login sessions interspersed with occasional incorrect one: ((lg(r+w)∗x)∗ lb(lg(r+w)∗x)+)∗ explained as“The user successfully logged in a numberof times, with one off bad logins in between”. Correct login sessions interspersed with occasional incorrect one or two: ((lg(r + w)∗x) ∗ (lb+ lblb)(lg(r+ w)∗x))∗ explained as “The user logged in a number of times, interspersed by sequences of one or two bad logins”.\nNote that xfst allows regular expressions that are parametrised for the number of\ntimes a repeated expression matches.

We can use techniques similar to the ones presented in the previous section, using regular expressions to specify contexts in which an action will be described in a particular manner.\nConsider the specification below, in which each action and natural language description pair is accompanied by two regular expressions which have to match with the part of the trace immediately preceding and following the action for that description to be used2:\n2 We use the notation a to signify any single symbol except for a.\nAction Pre Post CNL rendering\nx l x∗ – user logs out\notherwise user attempts to log out\nl – b the user attempts to log in\notherwise the user logs in\nThis technique can be further extended and refined to deal with repetition of actions as shown below with repeated logins:\nAction Pre Post CNL rendering\nl l b l ∗\nb user attempts to log in again\n– b user attempts to log in\nl b l ∗\n– user logs in again\notherwise user logs in\nIt is interesting to see how far this approach can be pushed and generalised to allow for the generation of more natural sounding text from the input traces."

Although there is still much to be done, the results are promising and it is planned that we use such an approach to allow for the specification of natural language explanations to be used in the runtime verification tool Larva [CPS09].\nTwo problems underlying our task are: (i) the discovery of subsequences that are interesting for the domain in question and (ii) how to turn an interesting subsequence into a natural-sounding explanation. In this paperwe have provided somewhat ad hoc solutions to both these problems. While one can use profiling techniques to discover interesting, or frequently occurring subsequences, clearly there needs to be a strong human input in identifying which of these sequences should be used to abstract and explain traces more effectively. On the other hand, we see that many of the ad hoc solutions adopted to make explanations more natural-sounding may be generalised to work on a wide-range of situations. We envisage that the person building the specification may add hints as to how to improve the explanation, such as the tables shown in Section 4.4 to improve abstraction and the ones given in Section 4.5 to add contextuality.\nGiven that, essentially, we are using regular grammars to specify our natural language generator, the generalisation process to reduce human inputwhile generatingmore natural-sounding text is bound to hit a limit. It is of interest to us, however, to investigate how far these approaches can be taken without resorting to more sophisticated techniques usually applied to language generation."
