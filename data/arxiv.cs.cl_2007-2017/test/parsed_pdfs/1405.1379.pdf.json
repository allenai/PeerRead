      "text" : "The human interaction paradigm with music playback devices has seen a dramatic shift as devices get smaller and more portable. Well-established interaction media such as remote controls are no longer adequate. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) interfaces offer a natural solution to this problem, where these devices are typically used in hands-busy, mobilityrequired scenarios [1]. Performing ASR on these small devices are highly challenging due to the music playback itself, the environmental noise, and the general environmental acoustics, e.g., reverberation [2]. In particular, due to the severe degradation of the input signal, the ASR performance drops significantly when the distance between the user and the microphone increases [3]. In the past decade, the literature on distant-talking speech interfaces provided several solutions to the problem, e.g., the DICIT project [4]. However, to the authors’ knowledge, the available solutions rely heavily on large microphone arrays [5], which may be infeasible for handheld portable device.\nIn this work, we present a robust front-end speech enhancement and ASR solution for a single-microphone limitedvocabulary system during continuous monaural music playback. In contrast to previous studies, the microphone in our system is placed in close proximity to the loudspeakers, and the voice command still needs to be recognized at a very low speech-to-echo ratio (SER) while the music is playing.\nThe front-end algorithm design effort can be divided in two parts. Firstly, we tailor known double-talk robust solutions for\nThe authors thank Stephen Nimick for recording the voice commands used in the experimental evaluation.\necho cancellation and speech enhancement to retrieve a clean estimate of the command [6, 7, 8]. Secondly, we propose a novel noise reduction method, where we combine a traditional minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) speech enhancement approach [9] with an estimate of the ideal binary mask [10]. The parameters of the algorithm are tuned for maximum recognition rate by casting the tuning problem as a nonlinear program, solved efficiently through a genetic algorithm (GA) [11]. A similar approach was used in [12, 13] to maximize the objective perceptual quality of a speech enhancement system for fullduplex communication. The training and evaluation corpora are generated through a synthetic mixture of clean speech (from the TIMIT database [14]) and music, both convolved with separate impulse responses, and further mixed with a background noise to cover as many deployment scenarios as possible. The acoustic models of the ASR are trained by the front-end enhanced speech, an effective way to learn and exploit the typical distortions of the system itself [15].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the speech enhancement algorithm and outline the parameters to be tuned. The tuning by nonlinear optimization of these parameters is presented in Section 3. The experimental results in Section 4 are divided in two parts. Firstly, we present the results of the training and evaluation of the front-end and acoustic models using the TIMIT database. Secondly, we change the language model and implement our ASR system for a limited vocabulary command recognizer in very adverse conditions. In Section 5, we conclude our work."

      "text" : "Since strong near-end interference may corrupt the error signal of the acoustic echo canceler (AEC) and cause the adaptive filter to diverge, the RAEC system [6, 8] is used, where the error recovery nonlinearity and robust adaptive step-size control allows for continuous tracking of the echo path during double talk. To reduce the delay of the frequency-domain adaptive filter [16], the multi-delay adaptive filter structure [17] is used. A cascaded structure similar to the system approach of [7] is used: the output of the first RAEC is fed to the input of the second RAEC, which is different from the original system approach in [7] where the input to the second RAEC is still the microphone signal (a parallel structure instead of the cascaded structure used in this work).\nThe tuning parameters for each of the RAECs consist of the frame size NAEC, the number of partitioned blocks MAEC, the number of iterationsNiter, the step-size µAEC, the tuning parameter γAEC for the robust adaptive step-size, and the smoothing factor αAEC for the power spectral density estimation."

      "heading" : "2.2. Residual Echo Power Estimator",
      "text" : "Since the AEC cannot cancel all the echo signal due to modeling mismatch, further enhancement from the residual echo suppressor (RES) is required to improve the voice quality. A coherence based method similar to [18, 19] is used for the RPE, and a modified version of the DTP estimator similar to [20] is used for a more accurate estimate of the residual echo power. As shown in Figure 1, the DTP estimator differs from that in [20] since the coherence is calculated between the RAEC estimated echo signal d̂ and the microphone signal y rather than between the loudspeaker signal x and the microphone signal y. This is possible since the estimated echo signal d̂ can be reliably obtained even during double talk due to the robust echo path tracking performance of the RAEC.\nIn this work, we propose to estimate the residual echo power by utilizing the output of the double talk probability estimator. Ideally, when the double-talk probability is high, the level of residual echo power estimate should be low so as to not distort the near-end speech when suppressing the residual echo. On the other hand, when the double-talk probability is low, the level of residual echo power estimate should be high to suppress as much residual echo as possible. The high level residual echo power λBH,k is estimated based on the coherence of the microphone signal Yk and the reference signal Xk, while the low level residual echo power λBL,k is estimated based on the coherence of the error signal Ek and the reference signal Xk. Finally, the residual echo power λB,k is estimated by utilizing the double-talk probability estimate PDTk obtained from DTP to combine λBH,k and λBL,k:\nλB,k[m] = (1− [m]PDTk [m])λBH,k[m] + P DT k [m]λBL,k[m],\n(1) where k is the frequency bin and m time frame.\nThe tuning parameters for the DTP consists of the transition probabilities a01, a10, b01, and b10, the smoothing factors αDTP and βDTP, the frequency bin range [kbegin, kend], the frame duration TDTP, and the adaptation time constants τ .

      "text" : "It has been recently shown that the speech recognition accuracy in noisy condition can be greatly improved by direct binary masking [10] when compared to marginalization [23] or spectral reconstruction [24]. Given our application scenario, we propose to combine the direct masking approach, particularly effective at low overall SNRs, with the NS output mask GLSAk , as shown in Figure 1. In particular, we exploit the estimated bin-based a priori SNR ξk to determine the type of masking to be applied to the spectrum. However, given than an accurate estimation of the binary mask is very difficult for very low SNRs, we elect to use the LSA estimated gain for those cases. Our masking then becomes:\nζk[m] =  [(1−Gmin)GLSAk [m] +Gmin], ξk[m] ≤ θ1, α 2 , θ1 < ξk[m] < θ2,\n2+α 2 , ξk[m] ≥ θ2,\nwhere Gmin is the minimum suppression gain [13], and the output is then:\nŜk[m] = ζk[m]Ek[m]. (3)\nIn Figure 2, we provide some data to justify our particular choice of masking. We compare three different speech enhancement methods presented in this section for unigram and bigram language models [25]. In the direct masking, ξk[m] is mapped directly to a constant threshold to generate the binary decision. It can be seen that our proposed method outperforms conventional methods at lower SNRs.\nThe tuning parameters for the direct masking consist of the minimum gain Gmin, the thresholds θ1 and θ2, and a tuning parameter α."

      "text" : "The tuning problem can be formalized as an optimization problem. In our case, the objective function to maximize is the ASR recognition rate R (ŝ[n]), where ŝ[n] is the processed speech, i.e., the output of the speech enhancement system. To restrict the search region, we can impose inequality constraints on the variables that simply determine lower and upper bounds limit for the components of the solution vector. Our optimization problem then becomes:\nmaximize R (ŝ[n,p]) subject to U ≤ p ≤ L, (4)\nwhere p is now the vector of the parameters that need tuning, ŝ[n,p] is the speech enhancement system output obtained with these parameters, and L and U represent, respectively, lower and upper bounds for the values each variable. The basic concept of a GA is to apply genetic operators, such as mutation and crossover, to evolve a set of M solutions, or population, Π(k) = {p(k)m ,m = 1, . . . ,M} in order to find the solution that maximizes the cost function [11, 26]. This procedure begins with a randomly chosen population Π(0) in the space of the feasible values [L,U], and it is repeated until a halting criterion is reached after K iterations. The set of parameters p (K) m ∈ Π(K) that maximizes the cost function will be our estimate:\np̂ = argmax p (K) m ∈Π(K)\nR ( ŝ[n,p(K)m ] ) . (5)"

For each file in the TIMIT database, the SER and SNR were chosen from uniform distributions ranging from −15 dB to −10 dB and from −10 dB to 10 dB, respectively. We used 12 impulse responses in the simulation, randomly picked and normalized to unitary energy. The values of σ1 and σ2 were calculated based on SER and SNR, and we set σ3 = 0.1.

We normalized the variance and mean of the MFCCs, as suggested in [10] for properly applying the direct masking. We used 5-state HMMs with a 8-mixture GMM for each phone.

For initial population, we chose a set of fairly well manually optimized parameters and reasonable bounds that allows us to use only three generations to reach convergence. The genetic algorithm had a population of M = 40 possible candidates, and the best N = 10 were migrated to the next generation. These values were chosen empirically by balancing the complexity and the accuracy of the results. The\nphone accuracy rate (PAR) using a bigram model increased from 35% to 40% after our optimization on the training data, proving the validity of our procedure.\nIn order to provide a fair comparison, we also tuned the parameters to maximize the mean opinion score (MOS) using the Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) [28], as done in [12], through the same GA setup and the same noisy TIMIT database. To assess the performance of our tuning method, we tested on data not used in the training by creating a second simulated noisy TIMIT database with different conditions. Results are shown in Table 1 for different types of noise. The SER and SNR were again chosen from uniform distributions ranging from −15 dB to −10 dB and from −10 dB to 10 dB, respectively. The “mix” noise was picked randomly from the babble, music, or factory noise. In the case of music, noisy files were generated from a set of tracks from different genres at different start points. When the front-end speech enhancer was not used, the PAR dropped to 10.1% (unigram) and 15.7% (bigram) for the noisy signal. Although used in a different setup, the results obtained with the proposed method compare favorably to some prior results [29, 30], where authors investigated joint echo cancellation and speech enhancement at higher SERs and SNRs."

      "text" : "We used eight subjects (male/female, native/non-native) who uttered the command list at a distance of around 1m from the microphone of the Beats PillTM portable speaker while music was playing. We used four different music tracks in the echo path, where the starting point of the track was chosen randomly. Subjects uttered the following commands towards the speakers:\n“PLAY”, “NEXT”, “BACK”, “PAUSE” (as shown in Figure 3). The playback level for the experiments was set to three different levels of 95 dB SPL, 90 dB SPL, and 85 dB SPL. We estimated the range of SER for the different setups to be approximately equal to −35 to −30 dB, −30 to −25 dB, and −25 to −20 dB for the three levels, respectively. The estimation of the SERs were made possible thanks to a lavalier microphone that recorded the near-end speech. Note that the SERs in the experiments are lower than the SERs used in the simulation, which validates the generalization of the tuning methodology. Recognition rates are given in Table 2 at different SER levels. Also in this case, we compared with the set of parameters obtained by optimization through POLQA [12]. The results clearly show that our proposed tuning based on ASR maximization outperforms the POLQA-based tuning. The difference in performance seems to derive from the POLQA optimization being less aggressive on noise in order to preserve speech quality. More noise in the processed files translates into worse performance of the speech recognizer and the VAD. As a reference, when our speech enhancement front end was not used, the average recognition rate was 25% over all commands (coin toss) in the lowest SER setup."

The proposed speech enhancement front-end consists of a cascaded robust AEC, a residual echo power estimator based on a double-talk probability estimator, and a novel quasi-binary masking that utilizes the classical MMSE-based method at very low SNRs. The tuning improves the speech recognition rate substantially on the TIMIT database. The optimized front-end is then tested in realistic environments for the remote control of a music playback device with a limited-sized command dictionary. The result shows a fairly high recognition rate for voice commands at a speech-to-music ratio as low as −35 dB, scenarios hardly seen through the literature."

The user controls the device through voice, where the speech-to-music ratio can be as low as −30 dB during music playback. We propose a speech enhancement front-end that relies on known robust methods for echo cancellation, doubletalk detection, and noise suppression, as well as a novel adaptive quasi-binary mask that is well suited for speech recognition. The optimization of the system is then formulated as a large scale nonlinear programming problem where the recognition rate is maximized and the optimal values for the system parameters are found through a genetic algorithm. We validate our methodology by testing over the TIMIT database for different music playback levels and noise types. Finally, we show that the proposed front-end allows a natural interaction with the device for limited-vocabulary voice commands.",
