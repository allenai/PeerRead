      "text" : "The task of automatic speaker identification consists of labeling an unknown voice sample as one of a set of known voices samples. Speaker identification methods can be divided into text-dependent and text-independent methods. For text dependent methods, the test utterance is known while for text independent methods, it is not known [9]. In this study, we performed experiments for text independent tasks in phone quality speech.\nIn general, speaker identification system is considered as comprised two major units namely enrollment (modeling) and identification (matching) as shown in (Figure 1). In enrollment phase, all samples from speakers are trained and stored in a database. The goal of enrollment is to construct a model for each speaker based on the features extracted from his/her speech samples. The identification is a process of computing a matching score between the input speech feature vector and a model of the speaker’s voice. Success in speaker identification tasks depends on these two phases. Nowadays, and in order to improve the identification performance, attention has turned to the applicability of fusing different systems at different levels.\nThis technique can be divided in two main categories: systems based on features diversity [18] and systems based on classifiers diversity [19]. Hence, searchers are looking for the best set of features and the best set of classifiers.\nIn this paper, we study these two categories. It consists on comparing the use of individual classifiers and combined classifiers, applied in individual data and in combined data. This task is of a high interest in vocal applications through the telephone network. We use for our\nexperiments the NTIMIT database [12]. This database represents a challenge due to the unpredictable channel noises.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the basic of the gaussian mixture speaker model. Section 3 defines the structure of the used classifiers. Section 4 describes the application of the data fusion for text independent speaker identification. Section 5 describes the experimental conditions and presents the experimental results. Conclusion is drawn in the final section."

      "heading" : "2. Speaker Modeling",
      "text" : "The feature vectors extracted from training data are used to create a set of speaker models. The modeling of a speaker may be implemented according to various techniques. The widely used one is the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).\nA GMM aims to approximate a complex nonlinear distribution using a mixture of simple gaussian models. A GMM is a weighted sum of M component Gaussian densities as given by (1):\n1\n( / ) ( ). M\ni i\ni p x p b x  \n\nWhere x is a d-dimensional vector, bi (x) are the component densities, pi are the mixture\nweights. Each component density is a d-variant Gaussian function having the form:\n1\n1\n22\n1 1 ( ) exp{ ( ) ( ).\n2 (2 )\nt\ni i id i\ni\nb x x x      \n  \n\n\nWith mean vector µi and covariance matrix ∑i, the mixture weights satisfy the constraint\nthat:\n1\n1. M\ni\ni p \n  \nIn this approach, a universal background model (UBM) learns the acoustic feature space. A standard approach in estimating the parameters of GMM-UBM aims to learn the mean vector, covariance matrix and the weight through expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [13] from a background dataset.\nEach speaker is then modeled and referred by adapting only the mean vectors of UBM using maximum a posteriori (MAP) criteria [5], while the weights and covariance matrix were set to the corresponding parameters of the UBM. All gaussian means vectors are pooled together to get one GMM supervector [3]. We produced GMM supervector on a per sequence. The GMM supervector can be thought of as a mapping between an utterance and a highdimensional vector."

This classifier assumes that the effect of an attribute value on a given class label is independent of the values of the other attributes. This assumption is called class conditional independence. This classifier simply computes the conditional probabilities of the different classes given the values of attributes and then selects the class with the highest conditional probability.\nIf an instance is described with n attributes ai (i=1…n), then the class that instance is classified to a class c from set of possible classes C according to a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) Naive Bayes classifier is:\n1 arg max ( ) ( ( ))\nj\nn\nj i j i\nc C\nc p c p a c \n\n  \nDespite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can often outperform more sophisticated classification\nmethods. For speaker recognition, NB algorithm is largely used, such in [8].\nIn our work, we propose the combination of both methods GMM and NB. We present the NB classifier in the supervector GMM space. This method is a novel approach substantially different from existing techniques."

SVMs are a new kernel method suitable for binary classification tasks that makes its decisions by constructing a hyperplane that optimally separates two classes.\nIn order to tackle non-linear classification problems, the input feature space is typically transformed to a higher dimensional space via a kernel function, where it is possible to define a hyperplane to separate both classes with maximum margin.\nFor speaker recognition, the first approach in using SVM classifier was implemented by Schmidt where SVM were trained directly on the acoustic space [6]. Another approach became recently more popular; consist of using an hybrid GMM-SVM [1, 2] in a way that the\nrobustness advantage of generative models of GMM is combined with the discriminative power of SVM."

    "abstractText" : "Several speaker identification systems are giving good performance with clean speech but are affected by the degradations introduced by noisy audio conditions. To deal with this problem, we investigate the use of complementary information at different levels for computing a combined match score for the unknown speaker. In this work, we observe the effect of two supervised machine learning approaches including support vectors machines (SVM) and naïve bayes (NB). We define two feature vector sets based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and relative spectral perceptual linear predictive coefficients (RASTA-PLP). Each feature is modeled using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Several ways of combining these information sources give significant improvements in a text-independent speaker identification task using a very large telephone degraded NTIMIT database.",
