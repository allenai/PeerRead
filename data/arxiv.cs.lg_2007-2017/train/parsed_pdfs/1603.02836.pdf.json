      "text" : "Artificial neural networks that have more than three hidden layers of neurons are called Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [1]. Every layer of a trained DNN represents a higher level abstraction of the input data than the previous one. DNNs are highly successful and provide the current state-of-the art results in many AI tasks. Stacked autoencoder is a class of DNN that is used for unsupervised representation learning and dimensionality reduction [2]. However, training deep architectures faced challenges ever since their introduction. The cost function being non-linear, gradient based routines usually get stuck in poor local minima for\nPresented as a paper at the Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Computing for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (PDCKDD 2015) as a part of European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practices of Knowledge\nDiscovery in Databases (ECML/PKDD 2015)\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n02 83\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nlarge initialization weights. On the other hand, with small initial weights backpropagated error gradients in the layers close to the input become tiny resulting in no appreciable training of those layers [3]. Greedy layer-wise pre-training was introduced with a motivation to approximately capture statistical abstractions of the input data in every layer and initialize the network parameters in a region near a good local optimum [4, 5]. This was followed by fine-tuning via backpropagation to push the solution deeper into the optimum. This approach of training deep architectures has brought great success in many areas of application [2, 3].\nThe time complexity of this process becomes forbiddingly large for big datasets and architectures. Hence there have been efforts at parallelization. These parallel algorithms fall in two broad categories [6]. The algorithms of the first category partition the neural network and train the parts in parallel. The neural network can be physically partitioned [7] or logically partitioned [8, 9]. The challenge is to ensure that the computational load is evenly distributed among the parallel processors and data communication is minimized. The second category of algorithms carry out calculations relative to the entire network but specific to subsets of data (single patterns or small batches of data) at different processing nodes [10]. This method is typically suitable for computer clusters as this requires very little communication. Each computing node i, generates its own update vector ∆wi on the basis of the data-set Di assigned to it. At the end of an epoch when all the nodes are ready, the overall ∆w is calculated by averaging the outputs of each of the nodes.\nAs mentioned earlier, the pre-training phase is crucial for convergence but to the best of our knowledge, all existing methodologies perform pre-training layer-bylayer in a greedy way. In this work we propose a synchronized parallel layer-wise pre-training algorithm. The layers are learnt on parallel running threads that are synchronized regularly by cascading of maturity information. It achieves faster learning due to parallelism and reduces chances of misfit among the layers owing to synchronization.\nSection 2 briefly introduces some theoretical concepts relevant to stacked autoencoders. The synchronized layer-wise pre-training algorithm is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents an experimental methodology to compare the proposed algorithm with greedy layer-wise pre-training and Section 5 discusses the results of the experiment. Finally Section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the work."

It is aimed at encoding input x into a representation c(x) so that the input can be reconstructed from the representation with minimum amount of deformation. Given a set of unlabelled training examples {x(1),x(2), ...} the autoencoder sets the outputs y(i) = x(i) and tries to learn a function hW,b such that hW,b(x) = x̂ ≈ x.\nA stacked autoencoder [2, 3] has multiple hidden layers of neurons between the input and output layers. A stacked autoencoder of depth n has an input layer, 2n− 3 hidden layers, and an output layer of neurons. Layers 1, 2, ..., n comprise the encoder and the remaining layers form the decoder. The nth layer is called the code layer.\nAutoencoder is usually trained by the backpropagation algorithm with an error criterion like mean squared error or cross entropy error [11]."

An RBM is a Markov Random Field associated with an undirected graph that consists of m visible units V = (V1, . . . , Vm) comprising the visible layer and n hidden units H = (H1, . . . ,Hn) comprising the hidden layer [2, 12]. There exists no connection among the units of the same layer in the graph.

Greedy layer-wise pre-training was introduced with a motivation to roughly capture statistical abstractions of the input data in every layer and initialize the network parameters in a region near a good local optimum [5], [3]. Figure 1 outlines the greedy layer-wise pretraining algorithm.\nLet us consider a deep neural network with K hidden layers of neurons. Let the input dimension be Ni, output dimension be No and the hidden layer dimensions be N1, N2, . . . , NK . Let us denote the training set by S. Greedy layer-wise pre-training follows one of the two methodologies described below.\nPre-training using RBM: In this approach, first an RBM with Ni visible nodes and N1 hidden nodes is trained. After training, the hidden weights and biases are used to initialize the incoming weights and biases respectively of the first hidden layer of the deep neural network. The input data of dimensionality Ni is transformed to the dimension N1 of the hidden layer. For an RBM with Bernoulli hidden units this is done by calculating the activation probabilities of the hidden units corresponding to the input examples v ∈ S as follows:\np(Hi = 1|v) = σ  m∑ j=1 wi,jvj + ci  (4) Now another RBM with N1 visible units and N2 hidden units is trained with the transformed data to find weights and biases which go and initialize the second hidden layer. The data is transformed to the dimension of the second hidden layer and this procedure is repeated for all of the hidden layers of the deep neural network.\nPre-training using autoencoder: Deep networks can also be initialized using autoencoders. In this methodology, single hidden-layer autoencoders are trained for each of the layers of the deep architecture and their weights and biases are used to initialize the corresponding layers of the deep architecture."

The four threads, T1 through T4 were run on four different cores of the same CPU. The time for communication of data among the threads was observed to be 5 to 6 orders of magnitude lesser than the time for an epoch of RBM pre-training.\nIn our experiment pre-training of the stacked autoencoder was concluded as soon as the RBM for the first layer (784− 1000) completed its stipulated 20 epochs. Though it changed DT2 and D V 2 after the 20\nth epoch, the parameters of L2 or any of its data-dependent layers were not updated. This was just to keep the total pre-training time equal to the time taken for L1 (the largest and the slowest to train layer) to complete its prescribed amount of pre-training.

      "text" : "Figure 3 shows the space-time diagram for the proposed algorithm. The variation of reconstruction errors of the training and validation examples have been plotted for each layer. Both the errors show a decreasing trend for the first three layers indicating the parameters of these layers, getting tuned to the given data. Initially the training and validation errors differ for all the layers but eventually converge to almost equal values. This indicates that the parameters achieve generalization beyond the training set in the course of pre-training.\nThe behavior of the fourth layer is particularly interesting. Figure 4 zooms into its timing diagram (marked with a dotted rectangle in Figure 3). The validation and training errors differ by a large margin for quite sometime (throughout the stipulated amount of pre-training and beyond) but eventually converge as T4 updates its parameters every time D T 4 and D V 4 are changed by T3. Also both the training and validation errors show an increasing trend throughout the process. Low initial reconstruction error that increases with the progress of training indicates that the random values to which the weights and biases of L4 were initialized, overfit the data that was provided by L3 initially. Significant difference between the training and validation errors during this period of time further corroborates the overfitting. However with the progress of training, as the data matures, the overfitting slowly cures and the training and validation\nerrors converge to close values. The increasing trend of the reconstruction error implicitly indicates how synchronization forces the innermost layer to increase its own error to conform to the remaining of the network. The behavior of the fourth layer also indicates the necessity of updating the parameters even after the stipulated amount of pre-training has been completed. As the training data of a hidden layer changes throughout the process of pre-training, the parameters must also be updated regularly to keep up with the changing data. This does not add an overhead to the total pre-training time which is always dictated by the time taken by the largest (or the most complex) layer to complete the stipulated number of epochs of pre-training."

The convergence and performance of the algorithm have been tested on the task of dimensionality reduction of MNIST handwritten digit database using stacked autoencoder and 26% speed-up has been observed for achieving the same performance. The key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is not greedy. This reduces chances of misfit among the layers, a common hazard of greedy learning and minimizes the idle time for each layer. The proposed algorithm can be seamlessly integrated with the existing methods of parallelization which mainly concentrate on the fine-tuning phase."

    "abstractText" : "Deep neural networks are capable of modelling highly nonlinear functions by capturing different levels of abstraction of data hierarchically. While training deep networks, first the system is initialized near a good optimum by greedy layer-wise unsupervised pre-training. However, with burgeoning data and increasing dimensions of the architecture, the time complexity of this approach becomes enormous. Also, greedy pre-training of the layers often turns detrimental by over-training a layer causing it to lose harmony with the rest of the network. In this paper a synchronized parallel algorithm for pre-training deep networks on multi-core machines has been proposed. Different layers are trained by parallel threads running on different cores with regular synchronization. Thus the pre-training process becomes faster and chances of overtraining are reduced. This is experimentally validated using a stacked autoencoder for dimensionality reduction of MNIST handwritten digit database. The proposed algorithm achieved 26% speed-up compared to greedy layer-wise pre-training for achieving the same reconstruction accuracy substantiating its potential as an alternative.",
