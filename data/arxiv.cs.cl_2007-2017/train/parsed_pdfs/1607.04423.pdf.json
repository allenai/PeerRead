      "text" : "To read and comprehend the human languages are challenging tasks for the machines, which requires that the understanding of natural languages and the ability to do reasoning over various clues. Reading comprehension is a general problem in the real world, which aims to read and comprehend a given article or context, and answer the questions based on it. Among various types of reading comprehension problems, the Cloze-style queries are the fundamental ones and has become a starter in tackling machine comprehensions. Similar to the general reading comprehension problems, the Cloze-style queries (Taylor, 1953) are raised based on the nature of the document, while the answer is a single word inside of the document.\nIn order to teach the machine to do Cloze-style reading comprehensions, large-scale training data is necessary for learning relationships between the given document and query. By adopting attention-based neural network approaches (Bahdanau et al., 2014), the machine can learn these patterns in large-scale training data. To create large-scale training data, Hermann et al. (2015) published the CNN/Daily Mail news corpus for Cloze-style reading comprehensions, where the content is formed by the news articles and its summary. Hill et al. (2015) released the Children’s Book Test (CBT) dataset afterwards, where the training samples are generated through automatic approaches. Also, Cui et al. (2016) has released the Chinese reading comprehension datasets for future research. As we can see that, automatically generating large-scale training data for neural network training is essential for reading comprehension. Furthermore, more complicated problems, such as reasoning or summarization of context, need much more data to learn the higher-level interactions.\nIn this paper, we present a novel and elegant neural network architecture, called attention-overattention model. As we can understand the meaning literally, our model aims to place another attention mechanism on the existing document-level attention. Unlike the previous works, that are using heuristic merging functions (Cui et al., 2016), or setting various hyper-parameters (Trischler et al., 2016), our model could automatically generate an “attended attention” over the various document-level attentions, and make a mutual look not only from query-to-document but also document-to-query, which will benefit from the interactive information.\nThis work was done by the Joint Laboratory of HIT and iFLYTEK (HFL).\nar X\niv :1\n60 7.\n04 42\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 Ju\nl 2 01\n6\nTo sum up, the main contributions of our work are listed as follows.\n• To our knowledge, this is the first time that the attention-over-attention mechanism is introduced.\n• Unlike the previous works on introducing complex architectures or many non-trainable hyperparameters to the model, our model is simple and without any burdens on hyper-parameter tuning, but outperforms various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin on the public datasets.\n• As our model is generalized, we believe the attention-over-attention mechanism can be used to other tasks as well.\nThe rest of our paper will be organized as follows. In Section 2, we will give an introduction to the Cloze-style reading comprehension task, and then talk about the related public datasets. Then the proposed attention-over-attention Reader will be presented in detail in Section 3. The experimental results will be given in Section 4. Related work will be discussed in Section 5, and we make a brief conclusion of our work at the end of this paper."

The Cloze-style reading comprehension problem (Taylor, 1953) aims to comprehend the given context or document, and then answer the questions based on the nature of the document, while the answer is a single word in the document.

      "heading" : "2.2 Existing Public Datasets",
      "text" : "Large-scale training data is essential for training neural networks. Recently, several public datasets for the Cloze-style reading comprehension are readily available. CNN/Daily Mail.1 Hermann et al. (2015) have firstly published two datasets: CNN and Daily Mail news data. They construct these datasets with web-crawled CNN and Daily Mail news data. One of the characteristics of these datasets is that the news article is often associated with a summary. So they first regard the main body of the news article as the Document, and the Query is formed by the summary of the article, where one entity word is replaced by a special placeholder to indicate the missing word. And finally, the replaced entity word will be the Answer of the Query. Also, they have proposed to anonymize the named entity tokens in the data, and re-shuffle the entity tokens for every sample to exploit general relationships between anonymized named entities, rather than the common knowledge. But as Chen et al. (2016)’s studies on these datasets showed that the anonymization of the entity word is less useful than expected. Here is an example of CNN news dataset shown in the below.\nDocument\n@entity2 celebrates his late strike as @entity5 retained their unbeaten @entity4 record with a 1 - 1 draw against @entity9 . @entity9 captain @entity14 had given the visitors a deserved first - half leadbut @entity2 ’s strike two minutes from time maintained @entity5 ’s nine - point lead at the top . @entity9 needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were\n1The pre-processed CNN and Daily Mail datasets are available at http://cs.nyu.edu/˜kcho/DMQA/\ndealt a cruel blow as @entity25 defender @entity24 was sent - off late on for two bookings in quick succession.\n. . . . . .\n@entity92 are up to fourth after they defeated @entity93 1 - 0 at home thanks to a goal from @entity96 forward @entity97 . e-mail to a friend\nQuery\nthe result keeps @placeholder nine points clear and retains their unbeaten league run\nAnswer\n@entity5\nChildren’s Book Test. 2 There was also a dataset called the Children’s Book Test (CBTest) released by Hill et al. (2015), which is built on the children’s book story through Project Gutenberg. Different from the previously published CNN/Daily Mail datasets, they formed the Document with 20 consecutive sentences in the book and regarded the 21st sentence as the Query, where one word is blanked with a special placeholder. Based on the type of missing word’s part-of-speech, the datasets are divided into four types: Named Entities (NE), Common Nouns (CN), Verbs and Prepositions. As the verbs and prepositions are less dependent with the document and fairly easy to answer than the others, most of the studies are focusing on the NE and CN datasets."

      "heading" : "3 Attention-over-Attention Reader",
      "text" : "In this section, we will introduce our attention-based neural network model for Cloze-style reading comprehension task, namely Attention-over-Attention Reader (AoA Reader). Our model is primarily motivated by Kadlec et al., (2016), which aims to directly estimate the answer from the document-level attention instead of calculating blended representations of the document. Some researchers also suggested that by just concatenating the final representations of the query RNN states is not enough for representing the full information of query (Cui et al., 2016). In this paper, we propose a novel work that placing another attention over the primary attention, to indicate the “importance” of each attentions.\nNow, we will give a formal description of our proposed model. Given a set of training triple 〈D,Q,A〉, the proposed model will be constructed in the following steps. Contextual Embedding. We first transform every word in the document D and query Q into one-hot representations, and then convert them into continuous representations with a shared embedding matrix We. As the query is typically shorter than the document, by sharing the embedding weights between the document and query, the representations of query can be benefited from the embedding learning in the document side, which is better than separating embedding matrices individually. After that, we use two bi-directional RNNs to get contextual representations of the document and query individually, where representation of each word is formed by concatenating the forward and backward hidden states. In our implementation, we utilized the bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014).\ne(x) =We ∗ x, where x ∈ D,Q (1) −−−→ hs(x) = −−−→ GRU(e(x)) ; ←−−− hs(x) = ←−−− GRU(e(x)) (2)\nhs(x) = [ −−−→ hs(x); ←−−− hs(x)] (3)\nWe take hdoc ∈ R|D|∗d and hquery ∈ R|Q|∗d to represent the contextual representations of document and query, where d is the dimension of GRUs. Pair-wise Matching Score. After obtaining the contextual embeddings of the document hdoc and query hquery, we calculate a pair-wise matching matrix, which indicate the pair-wise matching degree of one document word and one query word. Formally, when given ith word of document and jth word of query, we can compute a matching score their dot product.\n2The CBTest datasets are available at http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/babi/CBTest.tgz\nM(i, j) = hdoc(i) hquery(j) (4)\nIn this way, we can calculate every pair-wise matching score between the document and query, forming a matrix M ∈ R|D|∗|Q|, where the value of ith row and jth column is filled by M(i, j). Individual Attentions. After getting the pair-wise matching matrixM , we apply a column-wise softmax function to get probability distributions in each column, where each column is an individual documentlevel attention when considering a single query word. We denote α(t) ∈ R|D| as the document-level attention regarding query word at time t, which can be seen as a query-to-document attention.\nα(t) = softmax(M(1, t), ...,M(|D|, t)) (5)\nα = [α(1), α(2), ..., α(|Q|)] (6)\nAttention-over-Attention. Different from Cui et al. (2016), we use a more “wise” way to combine these document-level attentions into a final attention, while the previous work used naive heuristics, such as summing or averaging over individual attention α(t).\nFirst, we calculate a reversed attention, that is, for every document word at time t, we calculate the “importance” distribution on the query, to indicate which query words are more important given a single document word. We apply a row-wise softmax function to the pair-wise matching matrixM to get querylevel attentions. We denote β(t) ∈ R|Q| as the query-level attention regarding document word at time t, which can be seen as a document-to-query attention.\nβ(t) = softmax(M(t, 1), ...,M(t, |Q|)) (7)\nSo far, we have obtained both query-to-document attention α and document-to-query attention β. Our motivation is to exploit mutual informations between the document and query. However, most of the previous works are only relying on query-to-document attention, that is, only calculate a document-level attention when considering the query.\nThen we average all the β(t) to get an averaged query-level attention β. Note that, we do not apply another softmax to the β, because averaging individual attentions do not break the normalizing condition.\nβ = 1\nn |D|∑ t=1 β(t) (8)\nFinally, we calculate dot product of α and β to get the “attended document-level attention” s ∈ R|D|. Intuitively, this operation is calculating a weighted sum of each individual document-level attention α(t) when looking at query word at time t. In this way, the contributions by each query word can be learned explicitly, and the final decision (document-level attention) is made through the voted result by the importance of each query word.\ns = α β (9) Final Predictions. Following Kadlec et al. (2016), we map the attention results s to the vocabulary space V , and sum the attention value where the candidate word occurs in different places of the document.\nP (w|D,Q) = ∑\ni∈I(w,D)\nsi, w ∈ V (10)\nwhere I(w,D) indicate the positions that word w appear in the document D. The proposed neural network architecture is depicted in Figure 1. Note that, as our model mainly adds limited steps of calculations to the AS Reader (Kadlec et al., 2016) and do not employ any additional weights, the computational complexity is similar to the AS Reader."

      "text" : "To verify the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compared our model with other state-of-the-art systems on public datasets. Our evaluation is carried out on CNN news datasets (Hermann et al., 2015) and CBTest NE/CN datasets (Hill et al., 2015). The statistics of these datasets are listed in Table 2. Note that, no special pre-processing is done with these datasets. We evaluate the model in terms of its accuracy. Due to the time limitations, we are not able to evaluate our model in the ensemble, and only tested single model performance. We also added pretty new works to compare with (Dhingra et al., 2016; Sordoni et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016), which came to our attention when we are writing this paper. The experimental results are given in Table 3.\nCNN News. The results on CNN news datasets shows that our AoA Reader gives competitive results among various state-of-the-art baselines, including those cutting-edge systems. When compared to the previous best result (EpiReader), our model gives similar results, where 0.4% improvements in test set and gives slight drop in validation set by 0.3%. Except for EpiReader, our model shows an absolute advantage over all other models by a significant margin.\nTo investigate the effectiveness of employing attention-over-attention mechanism, we also compared our model to CAS Reader, where the latter used pre-defined heuristics. From the result, we can see that getting rid of those heuristics and letting the model to explicitly learn the weights between individual attentions could give a significant boost, where 4.1% and 3.7% improvements can be made in validation and test set.\nAlso, the Stanford AR (Chen et al., 2016) and GA Reader (Dhingra et al., 2016) utilized pre-trained word embeddings for initialization, while our model does not adopt any pre-trained model for initialization. Furthermore, we do not optimize for a certain type of dataset, unlike the Stanford AR only normalized the probabilities over the named entities, rather than all the words in the document, which demonstrate that our model is more general and powerful than previous works. We have also noticed that it is fairly hard for a single model to reach above 75%, as indicated in Chen et al. (2016)’s study showed that the coreference errors (roughly takes up 25%) make the questions “unanswerable” even for the humans. CBTest NE/CN. In CBTest NE dataset, our AoA Reader outperforms all the state-of-the-art systems by a large margin, where a 2.5% and 2.3% absolute accuracy improvements over the most recent state-ofthe-art system EpiReader in the validation and test set respectively. We have also noticed that, though we haven’t tried our model in ensemble, our single model could stay on par with the previous best system in the ensemble, and even we have an absolute improvement of 0.9% beyond the best ensemble model (Iterative Attention) in the validation set. This demonstrates that our model is powerful enough to compete with the ensemble models of previous works, and introducing ensembles in our model may have another boost in the performance, though we haven’t tried in this paper.\nIn CBTest CN dataset, our model gives modest improvements over the state-of-the-art systems. When compared with Iterative Attention model, our model shows a similar result, with slight improvements on validation and test set. But when compared to EpiReader, our model could give a significant improvement with 0.3% and 1.7% gains respectively, and even larger gains over GA Reader and all of the previous works, which also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model."

      "text" : "Cloze-style reading comprehension tasks have been widely investigated. To take a look at these models, we can find that almost all of them are attention-based neural networks, which indicate that the attentionbased model is powerful and essential in machine comprehensions. We will take a brief revisit to the previous works.\nHermann et al. (2015) have proposed a methodology for obtaining large quantities of 〈D,Q,A〉 triples. By using their method, a large number of training data can be obtained without much human intervention, and make it possible to train a reliable neural network to study the relationships inside of these triples. They proposed to use an attention-based neural network for tackling this task. Evaluation on CNN/DailyMail datasets showed that their approach is effective than traditional baselines.\nHill et al. (2015) also proposed a similar approach for large-scale training data collections for children’s book reading comprehension task. They proposed to use window-based memory network and self-supervision heuristics have been investigated. The results showed that their model had surpassed all other methods in predicting named entities(NE) and common nouns(CN) on both the CBT and the CNN QA benchmark.\nKadlec et al. (2016) proposed to use a simple model that using the document-level attention result to directly pick the answer from the document, rather than computing the weighted sum representation of the document like the previous works did. The proposed model is typically motivated by Pointer Network (Vinyals et al., 2015). This model aims to solve one particular task, where the answer is only a single\nword and should appear in the document at least once. Experimental results showed that their model outperformed previously proposed models by a large margin in public datasets (both CBTest NE/CN and CNN/DailyMail datasets).\nLiu et al. (2016) proposed an effective way to generate and exploit large-scale pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution task. The main idea behind their approach is to automatically generate largescale pseudo training data and then using the neural network model to resolve zero pronouns. They also propose a two-step training: a pre-training phase and an adaptation phase, and this can also be applied to other tasks as well. The experimental results on OntoNotes 5.0 corpus is encouraging, and the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\nWe also have noticed two very recent works (Sordoni et al., 2016) and (Trischler et al., 2016), during our writing of this article. Sordoni et al. (2016) have proposed an iterative alternating attention mechanism and gating strategies to accumulatively optimize the attention after several hops, where the number of hops is defined heuristically. Trischler et al. (2016) adopted a re-ranking strategy into the neural networks and used a joint-training method to optimize the neural network. The final prediction is determined by both the Extractor (Attention Sum Reader) and the Re-ranker (Reasoner). The works mentioned above, both outperformed the state-of-the-art systems.\nOur work is primarily inspired by Cui et al. (2016) and Kadlec et al. (2016) , where the latter model is widely applied to many follow-up works (Sordoni et al., 2016; Trischler et al., 2016; Cui et al., 2016). Unlike the CAS Reader proposed by Cui et al. (2016), we do not assume any heuristics to our model, such as using merge functions: sum, avg etc. We used a mechanism called “attention-over-attention” to explicitly calculate the weights between different individual document-level attentions, and get the final attention by computing the weighted sum of them. Also, we find that our model is typically general and simple than the recently proposed model, and our model brings significant improvements over these cutting edge systems."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we introduce a novel attention-based neural network to tackle the Cloze-style reading comprehension problems. The proposed Attention-over-Attention model aims to compute the attentions not only for the document but also the query side, which will benefit from the mutual information. Then a weighted sum of attention is carried out to get an attended attention over the document for the final predictions. Among several public datasets, our model could give consistent and significant improvements over various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin. A highlight in our model is that we propose to use the attention-over-attention mechanism to get “attended attention”. Besides this, our model is elegant and easy to carry out but shows promising results on this task.\nThe future work will be carried out in the following aspects. We believe that our model is general and may apply to other tasks as well, so firstly we are going to fully investigate the usage of this architecture in other tasks. Second, we are planning to investigate hybrid reading comprehension models to tackle the problems that rely on comprehensive reasoning on several sentences."
