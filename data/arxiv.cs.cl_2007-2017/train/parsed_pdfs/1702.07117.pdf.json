      "text" : "Word embeddings, e.g., distributed word representations [Mikolov et al., 2013], represent words with low dimensional and dense real-value vectors, which capture useful semantic and syntactic features of words. Distributed word embeddings can be used to measure word similarities by computing distances between vectors, which have been widely used in various IR and NLP tasks, such as entity recognition [Turian et al., 2010], disambiguation [Collobert et al., 2011] and parsing [Socher et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013]. Despite the success of previous approaches on word embeddings, they all assume each word has a specific meaning and represent each word with a single vector, which restricts their applications in fields with polysemous words, e.g., “bank” can be either “a financial institution” or “a raised area of ground along a river”.\nTo overcome this limitation, [Liu et al., 2015] propose a topic embedding approach, namely Topical Word Embeddings (TWE), to learn topic embeddings to characterize various meanings of polysemous words by concatenating\ntopic embeddings with word embeddings. Despite the success of TWE, compared to previous multi-prototype models [Reisinger and Mooney, 2010; Huang et al., 2012], it assumes that word distributions over topics are provided by off-theshelf topic models such as LDA, which would limit the applications of TWE once topic models do not perform well in some domains [Petterson et al., 2010; Phan et al., 2011]. As a matter of fact, pervasive polysemous words in documents would harm the performance of topic models that are based on co-occurrence of words in documents. Thus, a more realistic solution is to build both topic models with regard to polysemous words and polysemous word embeddings simultaneously, instead of using off-the-shelf topic models.\nIn this work, we propose a novel learning framework, called Latent Topical Skip-Gram (LTSG) model, to mutually learn polysemous-word models and topic models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers learning polysemous-word models and topic models simultaneously. Although there have been approaches that aim to improve topic models based on word embeddings MRF-LDA [Xie et al., 2015], they fail to improve word embeddings provided words are polysemous; although there have been approaches that aim to improve polysemous-word models TWE [Liu et al., 2015] based on topic models, they fail to improve topic models considering words are polysemous. Different from previous approaches, we introduce a new node Tw, called global topic, to capture all of the topics regarding polysemous word w based on topic-word distribution ϕ, and use the global topic to estimate the context of polysemous word w. Then we characterize polysemous word embeddings by concatenating word embeddings with topic embeddings. We illustrate our new model in Figure 1, where Figure 1(A) is the skip-gram model [Mikolov et al., 2013], which aims to maximize the probability of context c given word w, Figure 1(B) is the TWE model, which extends the skip-gram model to maximize the probability of context c given both word w and topic t, and Figure 1(C) is our LTSG model which aims to maximize the probability of context c given word w and global topic Tw. Tw is generated based on topic-word distribution ϕ (i.e., the joint distribution of topic embedding t and word embedding w) and topic embedding t (which is based on topic assignment z). Through our LTSG model, we can simultaneously learn word embeddingsw and global topic embeddings Tw for representing polysemous word embeddings, ar X iv :1 70 2. 07 11 7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Fe\nb 20\n17\nand topic word distribution ϕ for mining topics with regard to polysemous words. We will exhibit the effectiveness of our LTSG model in text classification and topic mining tasks with regard to polysemous words in documents.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we first introduce preliminaries of our LTSG model, and then present our LTSG algorithm in detail. After that, we evaluate our LTSG model by comparing our LTSG algorithm to state-of-the-art models in various datasets. Finally we review previous work related to our LTSG approach and conclude the paper with future work."

Extending Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) [Hofmann, 1999], LDA adds Dirichlet priors to document-specific topic mixtures to overcome the overfitting problem in PLSI. LDA aims at modeling each document as a mixture over sets of topics, each associated with a multinomial word distribution. Given a docu-\nment corpus D, each document wm ∈ D is assumed to have a distribution over K topics. The generative process of LDA is shown as follows,\n1. For each topic k = 1 → K, draw a distribution over words ϕk ∼ Dir(β)\n2.

TWE model employs LDA to obtain the topic distributions of document corpora and topic assginment for each word token. TWE model uses topic zm,n of target word to predict context word compared with only using the target word wm,n to predict context word in Skip-Gram. TWE is defined to maximize the following average log probability\nL(D) = 1∑M m=1Nm M∑ m=1 Nm∑ n=1 ∑ −c≤j≤c,j 6=0\nlog Pr(wm,n+j |wm,n) + log Pr(wm,n+j |zm,n).\n(3)\nTWE regards each topic as a pseudo word that appears in all positions of words assigned with this topic. When training TWE, Skip-Gram is being used for learning word embeddings. Afterwards, each topic embedding is initialized with the average over all words assigned to this topic and learned by keeping word embeddings unchanged.\nDespite the improvement over Skip-Gram, the parameters of LDA, word embeddings and topic embeddings are learned separately. In other word, TWE just uses LDA and Skip-Gram to obtain external knowledge for learning better topic embeddings.\n3 Our LTSG Algorithm Extending from the TWE model, the proposed Latent Topical Skip-Gram model (LTSG) directly integrates LDA and SkipGram by using topic-word distribution ϕ mentioned in topic models like LDA, as shown in Figure 1(C). We take three steps to learn topic modeling, word embeddings and topic embeddings simultaneously, as shown below.\nStep 1 Sample topic assignment for each word token. Given a specific word token wm,n, we sample its latent topic zm,n by performing Gibbs updating rule similar to LDA.\nStep 2 Compute topic embeddings. We average all words assigned to each topic to get the embedding of each topic.\nStep 3 Train word embeddings. We train word embeddings similar to Skip-Gram and TWE. Meanwhile, topicword distribution ϕ is updated based on Equation (10). The objective of this step is to maximize the following function\nL(D) = 1∑M m=1Nm M∑ m=1 Nm∑ n=1 ∑ −c≤j≤c,j 6=0\nlog Pr(wm,n+j |wm,n) + log Pr(wm,n+j |Twm,n), (4)\nwhere Twm,n = K∑\nk=1\ntk ·ϕk,wm,n . tk indicates the k-th\ntopic embedding.

      "text" : "To perform Gibbs sampling, the main target is to sample topic assingments zm,n for each word token wm,n. Given all topic assignments to all of the other words, the full conditional distribution Pr(zm,n = k|z−(m,n),w) is given below when applying collapsed Gibbs sampling [Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004],\nPr(zm,n = k|z−(m,n),w) ∝ n −(m,n) k,wm,n + β∑w w=1 n −(m,n) k,w +Wβ\n· n −(m,n) m,k + α∑K\nk′=1 n −(m,n) m,k′ +Kα\n,\n(5)\nwhere −(m,n) indicates that the current assignment of zm,n is excluded. nk,w and nm,k denote the number of word tokens w assigned to topic k and the count of word tokens in document m assinged to topic k, respectively.

Following the idea of DRS [Du et al., 2015], with the conjugacy property of Dirichlet and multinomial distributions, the Gibbs updating rule of our model LTSG can be approximately represented by\nPr(zm,n =k|w, z−(m,n),ϕ,α) ∝\nϕk,wm,n · n −(m,n) m,k + α∑K\nk′=1 n −(m,n) m,k′ +Kα\n.

      "text" : "LTSG aims to update ϕ during word embeddings training. Following the similar optimization as Skip-Gram, hierarchical softmax and negative sampling are used for training the word embeddings approximately due to the computationally expensive cost of the full softmax function which is proportional to vocabulary size W . LTSG uses stochastic gradient descent to optimize the objective function given in Equation (4).\nThe hierarchical softmax uses a binary tree (eg. a Huffman tree) representation of the output layer with theW words as its leaves and, for each node, explicitly represents the relative probabilities of its child nodes. There is a unique path from root to each word w and node(w, i) is the i-th node of the path. Let L(w) be the length of this path, then node(w, 1) = root and node(w,L(w)) = w. Let child(u) be an arbitrary child of node u, e.g. left child. By applying hierarchical softmax on Pr(wm,n+j |Twm,n) similar to Pr(wm,n+j |wm,n) desciebed in Skip-gram [Mikolov et al., 2013], we can compute the log gradient of ϕ as follows,\n∂ log Pr(wm,n+j |Twm,n) ∂ϕk=zm,n,w=wm,n = 1 L(wm,n − 1) L(wm,n)−1∑ i=1[\n1− hwm,n+ji+1 − σ(Twm,n · v wm,n+j i ) ] tk · v wm,n+j i ,\n(10)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)). Given a path from root to word wm,n+j constructed by Huffman tree, v wm,n+j i is the vector representation of i-th node. And hwm,n+ji+1 is the Huffman coding on the path defined as hwm,n+ji+1 = I ( node(wm,n+j , i+ 1) = child(node(wm,n+j , i) ) .\nFollow this idea, we can compute the gradients for updating the word w and non-leaf node. From Equation (10), we can see that ϕ is updated by using topic embeddings vk directly and word embeddings indirectly via the non-leaf nodes in Huffman tree, which is used for training the word embeddings.\n3.4 An overview of our LTSG algorithm In this section we provide an overview of our LTSG algorithm, as shown in Algorithm 1.

Vector representations, word embeddings and topic embeddings, map words and topics into a low-dimensional and dense real-value vector space, which have obtained high performance in NLP tasks. However, most of the existing models assume the result trained by one of them are perfect correct and used as prior knowledge for improving the other model. Some other models use the information trained from external large corpus to help improving smaller corpus. In this paper, we aim to build such an algorithm framework that makes topic models and vector representations mutually improve each other within the same corpus. An EM-style algorithm framework is employed to iteratively optimize both topic model and vector representations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-art methods on various NLP tasks.",
