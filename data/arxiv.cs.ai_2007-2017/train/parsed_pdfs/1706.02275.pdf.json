      "text" : "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been applied to solve challenging problems, from game playing [23, 28] to robotics [18]. In industrial applications, RL is emerging as a practical component in large scale systems such as data center cooling [1]. Most of the successes of RL have been in single agent domains, where modelling or predicting the behaviour of other actors in the environment is largely unnecessary.\nHowever, there are a number of important applications that involve interaction between multiple agents, where emergent behavior and complexity arise from agents co-evolving together. For example, multi-robot control [20], the discovery of communication and language [29, 8, 24], multiplayer games [27], and the analysis of social dilemmas [17] all operate in a multi-agent domain. Related problems, such as variants of hierarchical reinforcement learning [6] can also be seen as a multi-agent system, with multiple levels of hierarchy being equivalent to multiple agents. Additionally, multi-agent self-play has recently been shown to be a useful training paradigm [28, 30]. Successfully scaling RL to environments with multiple agents is crucial to building artificially intelligent systems that can productively interact with humans and each other.\nUnfortunately, traditional reinforcement learning approaches such as Q-Learning or policy gradient are poorly suited to multi-agent environments. One issue is that each agent’s policy is changing as training progresses, and the environment becomes non-stationary from the perspective of any individual agent (in a way that is not explainable by changes in the agent’s own policy). This presents learning stability challenges and prevents the straightforward use of past experience replay, which is\n∗Equal contribution.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n02 27\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 7\ncrucial for stabilizing deep Q-learning. Policy gradient methods, on the other hand, usually exhibit very high variance when coordination of multiple agents is required. Alternatively, one can use modelbased policy optimization which can learn optimal policies via back-propagation, but this requires a (differentiable) model of the world dynamics and assumptions about the interactions between agents. Applying these methods to competitive environments is also challenging from an optimization perspective, as evidenced by the notorious instability of adversarial training methods [11].\nIn this work, we propose a general-purpose multi-agent learning algorithm that: (1) leads to learned policies that only use local information (i.e. their own observations) at execution time, (2) does not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics or any particular structure on the communication method between agents, and (3) is applicable not only to cooperative interaction but to competitive or mixed interaction involving both physical and communicative behavior. The ability to act in mixed cooperative-competitive environments may be critical for intelligent agents; while competitive training provides a natural curriculum for learning [30], agents must also exhibit cooperative behavior (e.g. with humans) at execution time.\nWe adopt the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution, allowing the policies to use extra information to ease training, so long as this information is not used at test time. It is unnatural to do this with Q-learning without making additional assumptions about the structure of the environment, as the Q function generally cannot contain different information at training and test time. Thus, we propose a simple extension of actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents, while the actor only has access to local information. After training is completed, only the local actors are used at execution phase, acting in a decentralized manner and equally applicable in cooperative and competitive settings.\nSince the centralized critic function explicitly uses the decision-making policies of other agents, we additionally show that agents can learn approximate models of other agents online and effectively use them in their own policy learning procedure. We also introduce a method to improve the stability of multi-agent policies by training agents with an ensemble of policies, thus requiring robust interaction with a variety of collaborator and competitor policies. We empirically show the success of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover complex physical and communicative coordination strategies."

      "text" : "The simplest approach to learning in multi-agent settings is to use independently learning agents. This was attempted with Q-learning in [34], but does not perform well in practice [22]. As we will show, independently-learning policy gradient methods also perform poorly. One issue is that each agent’s policy changes during training, resulting in a non-stationary environment and preventing the naïve application of experience replay. Previous work has attempted to address this by inputting other agent’s policy parameters to the Q function [35], explicitly adding the iteration index to the replay buffer, or using importance sampling [9], but these approaches had mixed empirical success. Deep Q-learning approaches have previously been investigated in [33] to train competing Pong agents.\nThe nature of interaction between agents can either be cooperative, competitive, or both and many algorithms are designed only for a particular nature of interaction. Most studied are cooperative settings, with strategies such as optimistic and hysteretic Q function updates [15, 21, 25], which assume that the actions of other agents are made to improve collective reward. Another approach is to indirectly arrive at cooperation via sharing of policy parameters [12], but this requires a homogeneous agent population. These algorithms are not applicable in competitive or mixed settings. Concurrently to our work, [7] proposed a similar idea of using policy gradient methods with a centralized critic, and test their approach on a StarCraft micromanagement task. See [26, 4] for surveys of multi-agent learning approaches and applications.\nRecent work has focused on learning grounded cooperative communication protocols between agents to solve various tasks [29, 8, 24]. However, these methods assume a known model of the world dynamics, and are usually only applicable when the interaction between agents is focused over a dedicated, differentiable communication channel.\nOur method requires explicitly modeling decision-making process of other agents. The importance of such modeling has been recognized by both reinforcement learning [3, 5] and cognitive science communities [10]. [13] stressed the importance of being robust to the decision making process of\nother agents, as do others by building Bayesian models of decision making. We incorporate such robustness considerations by requiring that agents interact successfully with an ensemble of any possible policies of other agents, improving training stability and robustness of agents after training."

      "text" : "Markov Games In this work, we consider a multi-agent extension of Markov decision processes (MDPs) called partially observable Markov games [19]. A Markov game for N agents is defined by a set of states S describing the possible configurations of all agents, a set of actions A1, ...,AN and a set of observations O1, ...,ON for each agent. To choose actions, each agent i uses a stochastic policy πθi : Oi×Ai 7→ [0, 1], which produces the next state according to the state transition function T : S × A1 × ...×AN 7→ S.2 Each agent i obtains rewards as a function of the state and agent’s action ri : S × Ai 7→ R, and receives a private observation correlated with the state oi : S 7→ Oi. The initial states are determined by a distribution ρ : S 7→ [0, 1]. Each agent i aims to maximize its own total expected return Ri = ∑T t=0 γ trti where γ is a discount factor and T is the time horizon.\nQ-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). Q-Learning and DQN [23] are popular methods in reinforcement learning and have been previously applied to multi-agent settings [8, 35]. Q-Learning makes use of an action-value function for policy π as Qπ(s, a) = E[R|st = s, at = a]. This Q function can be recursively rewritten as Qπ(s, a) = Es′ [r(s, a) + γEa′∼π [Qπ(s′, a′)]]. DQN learns the action-value function Q∗ corresponding to the optimal policy by minimizing the loss:\nL(θ) = Es,a,r,s′ [(Q∗(s, a|θ)− y)2], where y = r + γmax a′ Q̄∗(s′, a′), (1)\nwhere Q̄ is a target Q function whose parameters are periodically updated with the most recent θ, which helps stabilize learning. Another crucial component of stabilizing DQN is the use of an experience replay buffer D containing tuples (s, a, r, s′). Q-Learning can be directly applied to multi-agent settings by having each agent i learn an independently optimal function Qi [34]. However, because agents are independently updating their policies as learning progresses, the environment appears non-stationary from the view of any one agent, violating Markov assumptions required for convergence of Q-learning. Another difficulty observed in [9] is that the experience replay buffer cannot be used in such a setting since in general, P (s′|s, a,π1, ...,πN ) 6= P (s′|s, a,π ′1, ...,π ′N ) when any πi 6= π ′i.\nPolicy Gradient (PG) Algorithms. Policy gradient methods are another popular choice for a variety of RL tasks. The main idea is to directly adjust the parameters θ of the policy in order to maximize the objective J(θ) = Es∼pπ ,a∼πθ [R] by taking steps in the direction of ∇θJ(θ). Using the Q function defined previously, the gradient of the policy can be written as [32]:\n∇θJ(θ) = Es∼pπ ,a∼πθ [∇θ logπθ(a|s)Qπ(s, a)], (2)\nwhere pπ is the state distribution. The policy gradient theorem has given rise to several practical algorithms, which often differ in how they estimate Qπ . For example, one can simply use a sample return Rt = ∑T i=t γ\ni−tri, which leads to the REINFORCE algorithm [37]. Alternatively, one could learn an approximation of the true action-value functionQπ(s, a) by e.g. temporal-difference learning [31]; this Qπ(s, a) is called the critic and leads to a variety of actor-critic algorithms [31].\nPolicy gradient methods are known to exhibit high variance gradient estimates. This is exacerbated in multi-agent settings; since an agent’s reward usually depends on the actions of many agents, the reward conditioned only on the agent’s own actions (when the actions of other agents are not considered in the agent’s optimization process) exhibits much more variability, thereby increasing the variance of its gradients. Below, we show a simple setting where the probability of taking a gradient step in the correct direction decreases exponentially with the number of agents.\nProposition 1. Consider N agents with binary actions: P (ai = 1) = θi, where R(a1, . . . , aN ) = 1a1=···=aN . We assume an uninformed scenario, in which agents are initialized to θi = 0.5 ∀i. Then, if we are estimating the gradient of the cost J with policy gradient, we have:\n2To minimize notation we will often omit θ from the subscript of π .\nP (〈∇̂J,∇J〉 > 0) ∝ (0.5)N\nwhere ∇̂J is the policy gradient estimator from a single sample, and∇J is the true gradient.\nProof. See Appendix.\nThe use of baselines, such as value function baselines typically used to ameliorate high variance, is problematic in multi-agent settings due to the non-stationarity issues mentioned previously.\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) Algorithms. It is also possible to extend the policy gradient framework to deterministic policies µθ : S 7→ A. In particular, under certain conditions we can write the gradient of the objective J(θ) = Es∼pµ [R(s, a)] as:\n∇θJ(θ) = Es∼D[∇θµθ(a|s)∇aQµ(s, a)|a=µθ(s)] (3)\nSince this theorem relies on∇aQµ(s, a), it requires that the action space A (and thus the policy µ) be continuous.\nDeep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is a variant of DPG where the policy µ and critic Qµ are approximated with deep neural networks. DDPG is an off-policy algorithm, and samples trajectories from a replay buffer of experiences that are stored throughout training. DDPG also makes use of a target network, as in DQN [23]."

Our goal in this section is to derive an algorithm that works well in such settings. However, we would like to operate under the following constraints: (1) the learned policies can only use local information (i.e. their own observations) at execution time, (2) we do not assume a differentiable model of the environment dynamics, unlike in [24], and (3) we do not assume any particular structure on\nthe communication method between agents (that is, we don’t assume a differentiable communication channel). Fulfilling the above desiderata would provide a general-purpose multi-agent learning algorithm that could be applied not just to cooperative games with explicit communication channels, but competitive games and games involving only physical interactions between agents.\nSimilarly to [8], we accomplish our goal by adopting the framework of centralized training with decentralized execution. Thus, we allow the policies to use extra information to ease training, so long as this information is not used at test time. It is unnatural to do this with Q-learning, as the Q function generally cannot contain different information at training and test time. Thus, we propose a simple extension of actor-critic policy gradient methods where the critic is augmented with extra information about the policies of other agents.\nMore concretely, consider a game with N agents with policies parameterized by θ = {θ1, ..., θN}, and let π = {π1, ...,πN} be the set of all agent policies. Then we can write the gradient of the expected return for agent i, J(θi) = E[Ri] as:\n∇θiJ(θi) = Es∼pµ ,ai∼πi [∇θi logπi(ai|oi)Qπi (x, a1, ..., aN )]. (4)\nHere Qπi (x, a1, ..., aN ) is a centralized action-value function that takes as input the actions of all agents, a1, . . . , aN , in addition to some state information x, and outputs the Q-value for agent i. In the simplest case, x could consist of the observations of all agents, x = (o1, ..., oN ), however we\ncould also include additional state information if available. Since each Qπi is learned separately, agents can have arbitrary reward structures, including conflicting rewards in a competitive setting.\nWe can extend the above idea to work with deterministic policies. If we now consider N continuous policies µθi w.r.t. parameters θi (abbreviated as µi), the gradient can be written as:\n∇θiJ(µi) = Ex,a∼D[∇θiµi(ai|oi)∇aiQ µ i (x, a1, ..., aN )|ai=µi(oi)], (5)\nHere the experience replay buffer D contains the tuples (x,x′, a1, . . . , aN , r1, . . . , rN ), recording experiences of all agents. The centralized action-value function Qµi is updated as:\nL(θi) = Ex,a,r,x′ [(Qµi (x, a1, . . . , aN )− y) 2], y = ri + γ Q\nµ′\ni (x ′, a′1, . . . , a ′ N ) ∣∣ a′j=µ ′ j(oj) , (6)\nwhere µ′ = {µθ′1 , ...,µθ′N } is the set of target policies with delayed parameters θ ′ i. As shown in Section 5, we find the centralized critic with deterministic policies works very well in practice, and refer to it as multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). We provide the description of the full algorithm in the Appendix.\nA primary motivation behind MADDPG is that, if we know the actions taken by all agents, the environment is stationary even as the policies change, since P (s′|s, a1, ..., aN ,π1, ...,πN ) = P (s′|s, a1, ..., aN ) = P (s′|s, a1, ..., aN ,π ′1, ...,π ′N ) for any πi 6= π ′i. This is not the case if we do not explicitly condition on the actions of other agents, as done for most traditional RL methods.\nNote that we require the policies of other agents to apply an update in Eq. 6. Knowing the observations and policies of other agents is not a particularly restrictive assumption; if our goal is to train agents to exhibit complex communicative behaviour in simulation, this information is often available to all agents. However, we can relax this assumption if necessary by learning the policies of other agents from observations — we describe a method of doing this in Section 4.2."

      "text" : "As previously mentioned, a recurring problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning is the environment non-stationarity due to the agents’ changing policies. This is particularly true in competitive settings, where agents can derive a strong policy by overfitting to the behavior of their competitors. Such policies are undesirable as they are brittle and may fail when the competitors alter their strategies.\nTo obtain multi-agent policies that are more robust to changes in the policy of competing agents, we propose to train a collection of K different sub-policies. At each episode, we randomly select one particular sub-policy for each agent to execute. Suppose that policy µi is an ensemble of K different sub-policies with sub-policy k denoted by µ\nθ (k) i (denoted as µ(k)i ).

      "text" : "To perform our experiments, we adopt the grounded communication environment proposed in [24], which consists of N agents and L landmarks inhabiting a two-dimensional world with continuous space and discrete time. Agents may take physical actions in the environment and communication actions that get broadcasted to other agents. Unlike [24], we do not assume that all agents have identical action and observation spaces, or act according to the same policy π . We also consider games that are both cooperative (all agents must maximize a shared return) and competitive (agents have conflicting goals). Some environments require explicit communication between agents in order to achieve the best reward, while in other environments agents can only perform physical actions. We provide details for each environment below.\nspeaker\nlistener“green”\nagent 1\nagent 3\nlandmark\nlandmark\nlandmark\np\nv\nc\nagent 2\npredator 1\nprey\npredator 2\npredator 3\nagent 1 agent 2\nagent 3\nagent 1 agent 2\nadversary\n?\nFigure 2: Illustrations of the experimental environment and some tasks we consider, including a) Cooperative Communication b) Predator-Prey c) Cooperative Navigation d) Physical Deception. See webpage for videos of all experimental results.\nCooperative communication. This task consists of two cooperative agents, a speaker and a listener, who are placed in an environment with three landmarks of differing colors. At each episode, the listener must navigate to a landmark of a particular color, and obtains reward based on its distance to the correct landmark. However, while the listener can observe the relative position and color of the landmarks, it does not know which landmark it must navigate to. Conversely, the speaker’s observation consists of the correct landmark color, and it can produce a communication output at each time step which is observed by the listener. Thus, the speaker must learn to output the landmark colour based on the motions of the listener. Although this problem is relatively simple, as we show in Section 5.2 it poses a significant challenge to traditional RL algorithms.\nCooperative navigation. In this environment, agents must cooperate through physical actions to reach a set of L landmarks. Agents observe the relative positions of other agents and landmarks, and are collectively rewarded based on the proximity of any agent to each landmark. In other words, the agents have to ‘cover’ all of the landmarks. Further, the agents occupy significant physical space and are penalized when colliding with each other. Our agents learn to infer the landmark they must cover, and move there while avoiding other agents.\nKeep-away. This scenario consists of L landmarks including a target landmark, N cooperating agents who know the target landmark and are rewarded based on their distance to the target, and M adversarial agents who must prevent the cooperating agents from reaching the target. Adversaries accomplish this by physically pushing the agents away from the landmark, temporarily occupying it. While the adversaries are also rewarded based on their distance to the target landmark, they do not know the correct target; this must be inferred from the movements of the agents.\nPhysical deception. Here, N agents cooperate to reach a single target landmark from a total of N landmarks. They are rewarded based on the minimum distance of any agent to the target (so only one\n1 Videos of our experimental results can be viewed at https://sites.google.com/site/multiagentac/\nagent needs to reach the target landmark). However, a lone adversary also desires to reach the target landmark; the catch is that the adversary does not know which of the landmarks is the correct one. Thus the cooperating agents, who are penalized based on the adversary distance to the target, learn to spread out and cover all landmarks so as to deceive the adversary.\nPredator-prey. In this variant of the classic predator-prey game, N slower cooperating agents must chase the faster adversary around a randomly generated environment with L large landmarks impeding the way. Each time the cooperative agents collide with an adversary, the agents are rewarded while the adversary is penalized. Agents observe the relative positions and velocities of the agents, and the positions of the landmarks.\nCovert communication. This is an adversarial communication environment, where a speaker agent (‘Alice’) must communicate a message to a listener agent (‘Bob’), who must reconstruct the message at the other end. However, an adversarial agent (‘Eve’) is also observing the channel, and wants to reconstruct the message — Alice and Bob are penalized based on Eve’s reconstruction, and thus Alice must encode her message using a randomly generated key, known only to Alice and Bob. This is similar to the cryptography environment considered in [2]."

      "text" : "We implement our MADDPG algorithm and evaluate it on the environments presented in Section 5.1. Unless otherwise specified, our policies are parameterized by a two-layer ReLU MLP with 64 units per layer. To support discrete communication messages, we use the Gumbel-Softmax estimator [14]. To evaluate the quality of policies learned in competitive settings, we pitch MADDPG agents against DDPG agents, and compare the resulting success of the agents and adversaries in the environment. We train our models until convergence, and then evaluate them by averaging various metrics for 1000 further iterations. We provide the tables and details of our results (including hyperparameters) on all environments in the Appendix, and summarize them here.\nWe first examine the cooperative communication scenario. Despite the simplicity of the task (the speaker only needs to learn to output its observation), traditional RL methods such as DQN, Actor-Critic, a first-order implementation of TRPO, and DDPG all fail to learn the correct behaviour (measured by whether the listener is within a short distance from the target landmark). In practice we observed that the listener learns to ignore the speaker and simply moves to the middle of all observed landmarks. We plot the learning curves over 25000 episodes for various approaches in Figure 4.\nWe hypothesize that a primary reason for the failure of traditional RL methods in this (and\nother) multi-agent settings is the lack of a consistent gradient signal. For example, if the speaker utters the correct symbol while the listener moves in the wrong direction, the speaker is penalized. This problem is exacerbated as the number of time steps grows: we observed that traditional policy gradient methods can learn when the objective of the listener is simply to reconstruct the observation of the speaker in a single time step, or if the initial positions of agents and landmarks are fixed and evenly distributed. This indicates that many of the multi-agent methods previously proposed for scenarios with short time horizons (e.g. [16]) may not generalize to more complex tasks.\nthe cooperating DDPG agents, who are unable to deceive MADDPG adversaries in any scenario, and do not even deceive other DDPG agents when L = 4.\nWhile the cooperative navigation and predator-prey tasks have a less stark divide between success and failure, in both cases the MADDPG agents outperform the DDPG agents. In cooperative navigation, MADDPG agents have a slightly smaller average distance to each landmark, but have almost half the average number of collisions per episode (when N = 2) compared to DDPG agents due to the ease of coordination. Similarly, MADDPG predators are far more successful at chasing DDPG prey (16.1 collisions/episode) than the converse (10.3 collisions/episode).\nIn the covert communication environment, we found that Bob trained with both MADDPG and DDPG out-performs Eve in terms of reconstructing Alice’s message. However, Bob trained with\nMADDPG achieves a larger relative success rate compared with DDPG (52.4% to 25.1%). Further, only Alice trained with MADDPG can encode her message such that Eve achieves near-random reconstruction accuracy. The learning curve (a sample plot is shown in Appendix) shows that the oscillation due to the competitive nature of the environment often cannot be overcome with common decentralized RL methods. We emphasize that we do not use any of the tricks required for the cryptography environment from [2], including modifying Eve’s loss function, alternating agent and adversary training, and using a hybrid ‘mix & transform’ feed-forward and convolutional architecture."

We observe that agents with policy ensembles are stronger than those with a single policy.

We begin by analyzing the difficulty of traditional algorithms in the multi-agent case: Q-learning is challenged by an inherent non-stationarity of the environment, while policy gradient suffers from a variance that increases as the number of agents grows. We then present an adaptation of actor-critic methods that considers action policies of other agents and is able to successfully learn policies that require complex multiagent coordination. Additionally, we introduce a training regimen utilizing an ensemble of policies for each agent that leads to more robust multi-agent policies. We show the strength of our approach compared to existing methods in cooperative as well as competitive scenarios, where agent populations are able to discover various physical and informational coordination strategies.",
