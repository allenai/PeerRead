      "text" : "Knowledge bases (KBs), such as WordNet (Miller, 1995), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007), Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) and DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2015), represent relationships between entities as triples (head entity, relation, tail entity). Even very large knowledge bases are still far from complete (Socher et al., 2013; West et al., 2014). Knowledge base completion or link prediction systems (Nickel et al., 2015) predict which triples not in a knowledge base are likely to be true (Taskar et al., 2004; Bordes et al., 2011).\nEmbedding models for KB completion associate entities and/or relations with dense feature vectors or matrices. Such models obtain state-of-the-art\n∗To appear in Proceedings of CoNLL 2016.\nperformance (Bordes et al., 2012; Bordes et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Guu et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016) and generalize to large KBs (Krompa et al., 2015).\nMost embedding models for KB completion learn only from triples and by doing so, ignore lots of information implicitly provided by the structure of the knowledge graph. Recently, several authors have addressed this issue by incorporating relation path information into model learning (Garcı́aDurán et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015a; Guu et al., 2015; Toutanova et al., 2016) and have shown that the relation paths between entities in KBs provide useful information and improve knowledge base completion. For instance, a three-relation path\n(head,born in hospital/r1, e1)\n⇒(e1, hospital located in city/r2, e2) ⇒(e2, city in country/r3, tail)\nis likely to indicate that the fact (head, nationality, tail) could be true, so the relation path here p = {r1, r2, r3} is useful for predicting the relationship “nationality” between the head and tail entities.\nBesides the relation paths, there could be other useful information implicitly presented in the knowledge base that could be exploited for better KB completion. For instance, the whole neighborhood of entities could provide lots of useful information for predicting the relationship between two entities. Consider for example a KB fragment given in Figure 1. If we know that Ben Affleck has won an Oscar award and Ben Affleck lives in Los Angeles, then this can help us to predict that Ben Affleck is an actor or a film maker, rather than a lecturer or a doctor. If we additionally know that Ben Affleck’s gender is male then there is a higher chance for him to be a film maker. This intuition can be formalized by representing an entity vector ar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 46\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Ju\nn 20\n16\nas a relation-specific mixture of its neighborhood as follows:\nBen Affleck = ωr,1(Violet Anne, child of)\n+ ωr,2(male, gender −1) + ωr,3(Los Angeles, lives in −1) + ωr,4(Oscar award,won −1),\nwhere ωr,i are the mixing weights that indicate how important each neighboring relation is for predicting the relation r. For example, for predicting the occupation relationship, the knowledge about the child of relationship might not be that informative and thus the corresponding mixing coefficient can be close to zero, whereas it could be relevant for predicting some other relationship, such as parent or spouse, in which case the relation-specific mixing coefficient for the child of relationship could be high.\nThe primary contribution of this paper is introducing and formalizing the neighborhood mixture model. We demonstrate its usefulness by applying it to the well-known TransE model (Bordes et al., 2013). However, it could be applied to other embedding models as well, such as Bilinear models (Bordes et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2015) and STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016). While relation path models exploit extra information using longer paths existing in the KB, the neighborhood mixture model effectively incorporates information\nabout many paths simultaneously. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that it achieves superior performance over competitive baselines in three KB completion tasks: triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction."

To overcome this problem, we introduce in our implementation a filtering threshold τ and consider in the neighbor-based entity representation construction only those relation-specific neighboring entity sets for which |Ne,r| ≤ τ ."

The goal is to choose f such that the score f(h, r, t) of a plausible triple (h, r, t) is smaller than the score f(h′, r′, t′) of an implausible triple (h′, r′, t′).\nTransE (Bordes et al., 2013) is a simple embedding model for knowledge base completion, which, despite of its simplicity, obtains very competitive results (Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2016; Nickel et al., 2016).

In this case, TransE-NMM reduces to the plain TransE model. In all our experiments presented in section 4, the baseline TransE results are obtained with the TransE-NMM with τ = 0."

As the Unstructured model does not take the relationship into account, it cannot distinguish different relation types. The Structured Embedding (SE) model (Bordes et al., 2011) extends the Unstructured model by assuming that the head and tail entities are similar only in a relation-dependent subspace, where each relation is represented by two different matrices. Futhermore, the SME model (Bordes et al., 2012) uses four different matrices to project entity and relation vectors into a subspace. The TransH model (Wang et al., 2014) associates each relation with a relation-specific hyperplane and uses a projection vector to project entity vectors onto that hyperplane. TransD (Ji et al., 2015) and TransR/CTransR (Lin et al., 2015b) extend the TransH model by using two projection vectors and a matrix to project entity vectors into a relation-specific space, respectively. STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016) and TranSparse (Ji et al.,\n2016) are extensions of the TransR model, where head and tail entities are associated with their own projection matrices.\nThe DISTMULT model (Yang et al., 2015) is based on the Bilinear model (Nickel et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2012; Jenatton et al., 2012) where each relation is represented by a diagonal rather than a full matrix. The neural tensor network (NTN) model (Socher et al., 2013) uses a bilinear tensor operator to represent each relation. Similar quadratic forms are used to model entities and relations in KG2E (He et al., 2015) and TATEC (Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2016).\nRecently, Neelakantan et al. (2015), Gardner and Mitchell (2015), Luo et al. (2015), Lin et al. (2015a), Garcı́a-Durán et al. (2015), Guu et al. (2015) and Toutanova et al. (2016) showed that relation paths between entities in KBs provide richer information and improve the relationship prediction. In fact, our new TransE-NMM model can be also viewed as a three-relation path model as it takes into account the neighborhood entity and relation information of both head and tail entities in each triple.\nLuo et al. (2015) constructed relation paths between entities and viewing entities and relations\nin the path as pseudo-words applied Word2Vec algorithms (Mikolov et al., 2013) to produce pretrained vectors for these pseudo-words. Luo et al. (2015) showed that using these pre-trained vectors for initialization helps to improve the performance of the TransE, SME and SE models. RTransE (Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2015), PTransE (Lin et al., 2015a) and TransE-COMP (Guu et al., 2015) are extensions of the TransE model. These models similarly represent a relation path by a vector which is the sum of the vectors of all relations in the path, whereas in the Bilinear-COMP model (Guu et al., 2015), each relation is a matrix and so it represents the relation path by matrix multiplication. Our neighborhood mixture model can be adapted to both relation path models Bilinear-COMP and TransE-COMP, by replacing head and tail entity vectors by the neighborbased vector representations, thus combining advantages of both path and neighborhood information. Nickel et al. (2015) reviews other approaches for learning from KBs and multi-relational data."

      "heading" : "4.2 Evaluation tasks",
      "text" : "We evaluate our model on three commonly used benchmark tasks: triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction. This subsection describes those tasks in detail.\nTriple classification: The triple classification task was first introduced by Socher et al. (2013), and since then it has been used to evaluate various embedding models. The aim of the task is to predict whether a triple (h, r, t) is correct or not.\nFor classification, we set a relation-specific threshold θr for each relation type r. If the implausibility score of an unseen test triple (h, r, t) is smaller than θr then the triple will be classified as correct, otherwise incorrect. Following Socher et al. (2013), the relation-specific thresholds are determined by maximizing the micro-averaged accuracy, which is a per-triple average, on the validation set. We also report the macro-averaged accuracy, which is a per-relation average.\nEntity prediction: The entity prediction task (Bordes et al., 2013) predicts the head or the tail entity given the relation type and the other entity, i.e. predicting h given (?, r, t) or predicting t given (h, r, ?) where ? denotes the missing element. The results are evaluated using a ranking induced by the function f(h, r, t) on test triples. Note that the incorrect triples in the validation and test sets are not used for evaluating the entity prediction task nor the relation prediction task.\n1http://cs.stanford.edu/people/danqi/data/nips13-dataset.tar.bz2 2http://aclweb.org/anthology/attachments/P/P15/\nP15-1009.Datasets.zip\nEach correct test triple (h, r, t) is corrupted by replacing either its head or tail entity by each of the possible entities in turn, and then we rank these candidates in ascending order of their implausibility score. This is called as the “Raw” setting protocol. For the “Filtered” setting protocol described in Bordes et al. (2013), we also filter out before ranking any corrupted triples that appear in the KB. Ranking a corrupted triple appearing in the KB (i.e. a correct triple) higher than the original test triple is also correct, but is penalized by the “Raw” score, thus the “Filtered” setting provides a clearer view on the ranking performance.\nIn addition to the mean rank and the Hits@10 (i.e., the proportion of test triples for which the target entity was ranked in the top 10 predictions), which were originally used in the entity prediction task (Bordes et al., 2013), we also report the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), which is commonly used in information retrieval. In both “Raw” and “Filtered” settings, mean rank is always greater or equal to 1 and lower mean rank indicates better entity prediction performance. The MRR and Hits@10 scores always range from 0.0 to 1.0, and higher score reflects better prediction result.\nRelation prediction: The relation prediction task (Lin et al., 2015a) predicts the relation type given the head and tail entities, i.e. predicting r given (h, ?, t) where ? denotes the missing element. We corrupt each correct test triple (h, r, t) by replacing its relation r by each possible relation type in turn, and then rank these candidates in ascending order of their implausibility score. Just as in the entity prediction task, we use two setting protocols, “Raw” and “Filtered”, and evaluate on mean rank, MRR and Hits@10."

For TransE-NMM, we searched the hyperparameter δ ∈ {0, 1, 5, 10} and L2 regularizer λ ∈ {0.005, 0.01, 0.05}.

On the WN11 dataset, TransE-NMM only achieves better mean rank for entity prediction. The relation prediction results of TransE-NMM and TransE are relatively similar on both WN11 and FB13 because the number of relation types is small in these two datasets.

Note that there are higher results reported for NTN (Socher et al., 2013), Bilinear-COMP (Guu et al., 2015) and TransE-COMP when entity vectors are initialized by averaging the pre-trained word vectors (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). It is not surprising as many entity names in WordNet and FreeBase are lexically meaningful. It is possible for all other embedding models to utilize the pre-trained word vectors as well. However, as pointed out by Wang et al. (2014) and Guu et al. (2015), averaging the pre-trained word vectors for initializing entity vectors is an open problem and it is not always useful since entity names in many domain-specific KBs are not lexically meaningful.\nTable 5 compares the accuracy for triple classification, the raw mean rank and raw Hits@10 scores for entity prediction on the NELL186 dataset. The first three rows present the best results reported in Guo et al. (2015), while the next three rows present the best results reported in Luo et al. (2015).

      "text" : "Despite of the lower triple classification scores of TransE reported in Wang et al. (2014), Table 4 shows that TransE in fact obtains a very competitive accuracy. Particularly, compared to the relation path model TransE-COMP (Guu et al., 2015), when model parameters were randomly initialized, TransE obtains 85.2− 80.3 = 4.9% absolute accuracy improvement on the WN11 dataset while achieving similar score on the FB13 dataset. Our high results of the TransE model are probably due to a careful grid search and using the “Bernoulli” trick. Note that Lin et al. (2015b), Ji et al. (2015) and Ji et al. (2016) did not report the TransE results used for initializing TransR, TransD and TranSparse, respectively. They directly copied the TransE results previously reported in Wang et al. (2014). So it is difficult to determine exactly how much TransR, TransD and TranSparse gain over TransE. These models might obtain better results than previously reported when the TransE used for initalization performs as well as reported in this paper. Furthermore, Garcı́a-Durán et al. (2015), Lin et al. (2015a), Garcı́a-Durán et al. (2016) and Nickel et al.

The reason might be that in semantic lexical KBs such as WordNet where relationships between words or word groups are manually constructed, whole neighborhood information might be useful. So when using a small filtering threshold, the model ignores a lot of potential information that could help predicting relationships. Figure 2 presents relative improvements in entity prediction of TransE-NMM over TransE on WN11 when varying the filtering threshold τ . Figure 2 shows that TransE-NMM gains better scores with higher τ value. Specifically, when τ = 500 TransE-NMM does significantly better than TransE in all entity prediction metrics."

In this paper, we define a novel entity representation as a mixture of its neighborhood in the knowledge base and apply this technique on TransE—a well-known embedding model for knowledge base completion. Experimental results show that the neighborhood information significantly helps to improve the results of the TransE, leading to better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on three benchmark datasets for triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction tasks.",
