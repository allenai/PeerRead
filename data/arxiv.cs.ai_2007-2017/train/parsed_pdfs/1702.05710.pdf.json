      "text" : "Graph layout problems are a class of combinatorial optimization problems whose goal is to find a layout of an input graph G to optimize a certain objective function. A linear layout or layout of an undirected graph G = (V,E), where |V | = n is the bijective function ϕ : V → [n] = {1, 2, . . . ,n}. Set of all layouts is denoted by Φ(G). A Region in layout is defined as the area between two consecutive vertices in the layout. Vertex Separation minimization problem (VSMP) is to find a layout ϕ∗ ∈ Φ(G) of a graph G = (V,E) which minimizes the vertex separation (VS ) where V S = maxi∈[|V |] δ(i, ϕ,G) for a layout ϕ where, δ(i, ϕ,G) = |u ∈ L(i, ϕ,G) : ∃v ∈ R(i, ϕ,G) ∧ (u, v) ∈ E(G)|, L(i, ϕ,G) = {u ∈ V : ϕ(u) ≤ i} and R(i, ϕ,G) = {u ∈ V : ϕ(u) > i} [1, 4]. VSMP is NP-complete in general and has applications in VLSI design, graph drawing and computer language compiler design [2].\nFurther, in this paper, a vertex identifier corresponds to the vertices of graphs which are assumed to be the natural numbers 1,. . . ,n. For a vertex u ∈ V (G), neighbourhood of u in G, N(u) = {v ∈ V (G) : (u, v) ∈ E(G)} and degree of u in G, dG(u) = |v ∈ V (G) : (u, v) ∈ E(G)|. Fig. 1(b) represents a linear layout of Fig. 1(a). VS for this layout ϕ of G is 3. VSMP is polynomially solvable for grids, trees, permutation graphs and cographs [1, 4]. This problem has been explored using metaheuristics namely, variable neighbourhood search by [2, 5]\n∗Department of Mathematics, Dayalbagh Educational Insitute, Agra, India pallavijain.t.cms@gmail.com †Department of Mathematics, Dayalbagh Educational Insitute, Agra, India gursaran@dei.ac.in ‡Department of Mathematics, Dayalbagh Educational Insitute, Agra, India kamal.sri@dei.ac.in\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n05 71\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.D S]\n1 9\nFe b\n20 17\nin which they have proposed construction heuristics to generate an initial solution. Noberto et al. [3] highlight the importance of construction heuristics in metaheuristics. They have proposed eight construction heuristics and have compared all the construction heuristics. In this paper, we have proposed three construction heuristics H 1, H 2, H 3. An experiment has been performed to compare all the construction heuristics on the test instances of Grids, Small graphs, Trees and Harwell Boeing graphs, totaling 248 instances of graphs. Experiments reveal that H 1, H 2 and H 3 are able to achieve best results for 87.9%, 43.5% and 37.1% of the total instances respectively, while the best construction heuristic in the literature achieves the best solution for 39.9% of the total instances. We have also compared the results of H 1 with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic general variable neighbourhood search (GVNS) [5] and observed that the proposed construction heuristics improves the results for some of the input instances. It was also observed that GVNS obtains best results for 82.9% instances of all input instances while the heuristic H 1 obtained best results for 82.3% instances of all input instances. Further, in this paper Section 2 presents the construction heuristics proposed in this paper followed by computational experiments to show the efficiency of heuristics in Section 3."

      "text" : "In this section, three construction heuristics have been proposed. These heuristics construct a layout by iteratively adding vertices to an initially empty layout. In each iteration, heuristic H 1 tries to place a vertex u in the partial layout which minimizes its contribution as well as the contribution of vertices which are already placed in the partial layout. Motivation behind H 2 and H 3 is that if adjacent vertices are closely placed then they contribute to fewer regions. Further, in order to minimize the number of regions to which a vertex contributes, vertices of smaller degree are placed first in the partial layout. In the following sections, we describe the three construction heuristics which are essentially greedy methods."

The code was implemented in Matlab 7.0 and all the experiments were conducted on an Intel i3 based system with 4 GB RAM. The experiment to compare the construction heuristics was performed on the four sets of instances previously used for this problem [3]. The test set includes Small, Harwell-Boeing (HB) graphs, Grids and Trees. Since GVNS was tested on Harwell-Boeing (HB) graphs, Grids and Trees in the literature, therefore, construction heuristic H 1 and GVNS are compared on these instances only. The order of graph ranges from 9 to 2916. For each heuristic H 1, H 2 and H 3, 30 runs were carried out and the best value of vertex separation was recorded."

Average vertex separation obtained by GVNS and H 1 are listed in Table 3. Numbers in bold are the minimum in that column. Results show that for Trees, H 1 performs better while performance of GVNS on HB instance is good. When the average is considered over all the instances, performance of GVNS and H 1 is comparable.

The best performing construction heuristic H 1 was also compared with the state-of-the-art metaheuristic GVNS. This construction heuristic achieves best results in larger number of cases than GVNS. Since a good initial population is\nexpected to converge faster to a near optimal/optimal solution, therefore, initial solutions generated using this construction heuristic in any metaheuristic will lead to high quality solutions."
