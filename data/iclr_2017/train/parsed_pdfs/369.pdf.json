      "text" : "Deep neural networks are becoming the preferred approach for many machine learning applications. However, as networks get deeper, deploying a network with a large number of parameters on a small device becomes increasingly difficult. Much work has been done to reduce the size of networks. Halfprecision networks (Amodei et al., 2015) cut sizes of neural networks in half. XNOR-Net (Rastegari et al., 2016), DoReFa-Net (Zhou et al., 2016) and network binarization (Courbariaux et al.; 2015; Lin et al., 2015) use aggressively quantized weights, activations and gradients to further reduce computation during training. While weight binarization benefits from 32× smaller model size, the extreme compression rate comes with a loss of accuracy. Hubara et al. (2016) and Li & Liu (2016) propose ternary weight networks to trade off between model size and accuracy.\nIn this paper, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization which uses two full-precision scaling coefficients W pl , W n l for each layer l, and quantize the weights to {−Wnl , 0, +W p l } instead of traditional {-1, 0, +1} or {-E, 0, +E} where E is the mean of the absolute weight value, which is not learned. Our positive and negative weights have different absolute values W pl and W n l that are trainable parameters. We also maintain latent full-precision weights at training time, and discard them at test time. We back propagate the gradient to both W pl , W n l and to the latent full-precision weights. This makes it possible to adjust the ternary assignment (i.e. which of the three values a weight is assigned).\nOur quantization method, achieves higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. For AlexNet on ImageNet dataset, our method outperforms previously state-of-art ternary network(Li &\n∗Work done while at Stanford CVA lab.\nLiu, 2016) by 3.0% of Top-1 accuracy and the full-precision model by 1.6%. By converting most of the parameters to 2-bit values, we also compress the network by about 16x. Moreover, the advantage of few multiplications still remains, because W pl and W n l are fixed for each layer during inference. On custom hardware, multiplications can be pre-computed on activations, so only two multiplications per activation are required."

      "text" : "The potential of deep neural networks, once deployed to mobile devices, has the advantage of lower latency, no reliance on the network, and better user privacy. However, energy efficiency becomes the bottleneck for deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices because mobile devices are battery constrained. Current deep neural network models consist of hundreds of millions of parameters. Reducing the size of a DNN model makes the deployment on edge devices easier.\nFirst, a smaller model means less overhead when exporting models to clients. Take autonomous driving for example; Tesla periodically copies new models from their servers to customers’ cars. Smaller models require less communication in such over-the-air updates, making frequent updates more feasible. Another example is on Apple Store; apps above 100 MB will not download until you connect to Wi-Fi. It’s infeasible to put a large DNN model in an app. The second issue is energy consumption. Deep learning is energy consuming, which is problematic for battery-constrained mobile devices. As a result, iOS 10 requires iPhone to be plugged with charger while performing photo analysis. Fetching DNN models from memory takes more than two orders of magnitude more energy than arithmetic operations. Smaller neural networks require less memory bandwidth to fetch the model, saving the energy and extending battery life. The third issue is area cost. When deploying DNNs on Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), a sufficiently small model can be stored directly on-chip, and smaller models enable a smaller ASIC die.\nSeveral previous works aimed to improve energy and spatial efficiency of deep networks. One common strategy proven useful is to quantize 32-bit weights to one or two bits, which greatly reduces model size and saves memory reference. However, experimental results show that compressed weights usually come with degraded performance, which is a great loss for some performancesensitive applications. The contradiction between compression and performance motivates us to work on trained ternary quantization, minimizing performance degradation of deep neural networks while saving as much energy and space as possible."

Unlike above models using zero or symmetric thresholds to quantize high precision weights, Deep Compression used clusters to categorize weights into groups.

Next, we quantize the intermediate full-resolution weights to {-1, 0, +1} by thresholding. The threshold factor t is a hyper-parameter that is the same across all the layers in order to reduce the search space. Finally, we perform trained quantization by back propagating two gradients, as shown in the dashed lines in Figure 1. We back-propagate gradient1 to the full-resolution weights and gradient2 to the scaling coefficients. The former enables learning the ternary assignments, and the latter enables learning the ternary values.\nAt inference time, we throw away the full-resolution weights and only use ternary weights."

      "heading" : "4.1 LEARNING BOTH TERNARY VALUES AND TERNARY ASSIGNMENTS",
      "text" : "During gradient descent we learn both the quantized ternary weights (the codebook), and choose which of these values is assigned to each weight (choosing the codebook index).\nTo learn the ternary value (codebook), we introduce two quantization factors W pl and W n l for positive and negative weights in each layer l. During feed-forward, quantized ternary weights wtl are calculated as:\nwtl =  W pl : w̃l > ∆l\n0 : |w̃l| ≤ ∆l −Wnl : w̃l < −∆l\n(6)\nUnlike previous work where quantized weights are calculated from 32-bit weights, the scaling coefficients W pl and W n l are two independent parameters and are trained together with other parameters. Following the rule of gradient descent, derivatives of W pl and W n l are calculated as:\n∂L\n∂W pl = ∑ i∈Ipl ∂L ∂wtl (i) , ∂L ∂Wnl = ∑ i∈Inl ∂L ∂wtl (i) (7)\nHere Ipl = {i|w̃l(i) > ∆l} and Inl = {i|(i)w̃l < −∆l}. Furthermore, because of the existence of two scaling factors, gradients of latent full precision weights can no longer be calculated by Equation 2. We use scaled gradients for 32-bit weights:\n∂L ∂w̃l =  W pl × ∂L ∂wtl : w̃l > ∆l 1× ∂L ∂wtl : |w̃l| ≤ ∆l Wnl × ∂L\n∂wtl : w̃l < −∆l\n(8)\nNote we use scalar number 1 as factor of gradients of zero weights. The overall quantization process is illustrated as Figure 1. The evolution of the ternary weights from different layers during training is shown in Figure 2. We observe that as training proceeds, different layers behave differently: for the first quantized conv layer, the absolute values of W pl and W n l get smaller and sparsity gets lower, while for the last conv layer and fully connected layer, the absolute values of W pl and W n l get larger and sparsity gets higher.\nWe learn the ternary assignments (index to the codebook) by updating the latent full-resolution weights during training. This may cause the assignments to change between iterations. Note that the thresholds are not constants as the maximal absolute values change over time. Once an updated weight crosses the threshold, the ternary assignment is changed.\nThe benefits of using trained quantization factors are: i) The asymmetry of W pl 6= Wnl enables neural networks to have more model capacity. ii) Quantized weights play the role of \"learning rate multipliers\" during back propagation."

They optimized value of ±∆l by minimizing expectation of L2 distance between full precision weights and ternary weights. Instead of using a strictly optimized threshold, we adopt\ndifferent heuristics: 1) use the maximum absolute value of the weights as a reference to the layer’s threshold and maintain a constant factor t for all layers:\n∆l = t×max(|w̃|) (9)\nand 2) maintain a constant sparsity r for all layers throughout training. By adjusting the hyperparameter r we are able to obtain ternary weight networks with various sparsities. We use the first method and set t to 0.05 in experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet dataset and use the second one to explore a wider range of sparsities in section 5.1.1.\nWe perform our experiments on CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009) and ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2015).

Other layer parameters are all quantized to ternary values. We train our model on ImageNet from scratch using an Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba (2014)). Minibatch size is set to 128.

As the sparsity of weights grows from 0 (a pure binary-weight network) to 0.5 (a ternary network with 50% zeros), both the training and validation error decrease.

Minimum error occurs with sparsity between 30% and 50%.\nWe introduce only one hyper-parameter to reduce search space. This hyper-parameter can be either sparsity, or the threshold t w.r.t the max value in Equation 6. We find that using threshold produces better results.

However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it’s as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16× smaller than fullprecision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%.",
