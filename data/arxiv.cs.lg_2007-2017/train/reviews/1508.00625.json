These components can be computed one by one, repeatedly solving the single-component problem and deflating the input data matrix, but as we show this greedy procedure is suboptimal. We present a novel algorithm for sparse PCA that jointly optimizes multiple disjoint components. The extracted features capture variance that lies within a multiplicative factor arbitrarily close to 1 from the optimal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and computes the desired components by solving multiple instances of the bipartite maximum weight matching problem. Its complexity grows as a low order polynomial in the ambient dimension of the input data matrix, but exponentially in its rank. However, it can be effectively applied on a low-dimensional sketch of the data; this allows us to obtain polynomial-time approximation guarantees via spectral bounds. We evaluate our algorithm on real data-sets and empirically demonstrate that in many cases it outperforms existing, deflation-based approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Aug 2015 00:12:35 GMT  (6911kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00625v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["megasthenis asteris", "dimitris s papailiopoulos", "anastasios kyrillidis", "alexandros g dimakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.00625"}
