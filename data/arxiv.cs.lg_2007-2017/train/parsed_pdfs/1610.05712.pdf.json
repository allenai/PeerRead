      "text" : "This paper addresses the problem of fitting multiple instances of a given parametric model to data corrupted by noise and outliers. This is a prevalent problem for example in computer vision, found in a wide range of applications such as finding lines/circles/ellipses in images, homography estimation in stereo vision, motion estimation and segmentation, and the geometric analysis of 3D point clouds. Finding a single instance of a parametric model in a dataset is a robust fitting problem that is hard on its own; the difficulties are exacerbated when multiple instances might be present in the dataset due to the unavoidable emergence of pseudo-outliers (data points that belong to one structure and are usually outliers to any other structure). Thus, we face the problem of simultaneous robust estimation of model parameters and attribution of data points to the estimated models. These two problems are intrinsically intertwined. Furthermore, the correct number of model instances is not known in advance.\nFormally, the data is a set X = {xi}mi=1 of m objects, described by\nX = (⋃ k Xk ) ∪ O with (∀k) Xk ∩ O = ∅. (1)\n∗. This work was partially supported by Google, NSF, ONR, NGA, and ARO.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 71\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n1 N\nov 2\n01 6\nThe objects in each subset Xk, which might intersect, are (noisy) measurements that can be described with a parametric model µ(θk), with parameter vector θk. In the following, we say that the objects in Xk are inliers to the model µ(θk). We also generally refer to a set of objects as inliers, in the sense that there is a statistically meaningful instance of a parametric model that describes them. The objects in O cannot be described with such a model and we refer to them as outliers.\nLet us define more formally these intuitive concepts. A model µ is defined as the zero level set of a smooth parametric function fµ(x; θ),\nµ(θ) = {x ∈ Rd, fµ(x; θ) = 0}, (2)\nwhere θ is a parameter vector. We define the error associated with the datum x ∈ X with respect to the model µ(θ) as\neµ(x, θ) = min x′∈µ(θ)\ndist(x,x′), (3)\nwhere dist is an appropriate distance function. Using this error metric, we define the Consensus Set (CS) of a model as\nCµ(X , θ, δ) = {x ∈ X , eµ(x, θ) ≤ δ}, (4)\nwhere δ is a threshold that accounts for the measurement noise and/or model mismatch.\nMultiple Parametric Model Estimation (MPME) seeks to find the set of inliers-model pairs (Xk, θk) from the observed X such that Xk = Cµ (X , θk, δ). This problem is, by itself, ill-posed. It is standard in the literature to implicitly or explicitly impose a penalty on the number of recovered pairs to render it tractable. We also adopt such a design choice. Notice that once Xk is found, the corresponding θk can be estimated for example by simple least-squares regression, i.e.,\nθ̂k = argmin θ ∑ x∈Xk [ eµ(x, θ) ]2 . (5)\nMPME is an important but difficult problem, as standard robust estimators, like RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) [8, 13], are designed to extract a single model. Let us then begin by formally explaining how does the RANSAC machinery work, to further illustrate the value and perspective of our proposed MPME formulation.\nLet us denote by b the minimum number of elements necessary to uniquely characterize a given parametric model, e.g., b = 2 for lines and b = 3 for circles. For example, if we want to discover alignments in a 2D point cloud, the elements are 2D points, models µ are lines, and b = 2, since a line is defined by two points. A set of b objects is called a minimal sample set (MSS). Generically, the random-sample-and-model-generation framework can be described by Algorithm 1. We first randomly sample n MSSs, each generating one model hypothesis. The number n is an overestimation of the number of trials needed to obtain a certain number of “good” models [13, 31, 37]. Then, we compute the CS of each model hypothesis using Equation (4). Let U be the set of all these consensus sets. From this point onwards, different algorithms perform different operations on U . Specifically, RANSAC, the\nAlgorithm 1: Random sampling algorithm\ninput : set of objects X , parametric function fµ, inliers threshold δ. output: pool U of consensus sets.\n1 b← minimum number of elements necessary to uniquely characterize model µ, see Equation (2); 2 foreach j ∈ {1 . . . n} do 3 Select at random a minimal sample set (MSS) Xmms(j) of size b from X ; 4 Estimate θj from Xmms(j) by solving (∀x ∈ Xmms(j)) fµ(x; θ) = 0; 5 U ← {Cµ (X , θj , δ)}nj=1, see Equation (4);\nalgorithm that introduced this framework, detects a single model by taking the CS from U with the largest size, and uses it to estimate θ from C as in Equation (5).\nApplying RANSAC sequentially, removing the inliers from the dataset as each model instance is detected, has been proposed as a solution for multi-model estimation, e.g., [24]. However, this approach is known to be suboptimal [37]. The multiRANSAC algorithm [37] provides a more effective alternative, although the number of models must be known a priori, imposing a very limiting constraint in many applications. An alternative approach consists of finding density modes in a parameter space. The overall idea is that we can map the data into the parameter space through random sampling, and then seek the modes of the distribution by discretizing the distribution, i.e., using the Randomized Hough Transform [35], or by using non-parametric density estimation techniques, like the mean-shift clustering algorithm [27]. These, however, are not intrinsically robust techniques, even if they can be robustified with outliers rejection heuristics [31]. Moreover, the choice of the parametrization and its discretization are critical, among other important shortcomings [31]. The computational cost of these techniques can be very high as well. From a different perspective, J-linkage [31], T-linkage [20], and RPA [21] address the problem by clustering the dataset. We will provide more details about these methods in the next section.\nContributions. We have previously introduced a novel framework and perspective to reach consensus in grouping problems by re-framing them as biclustering problems [30]. In particular, the task of finding/fitting multiple parametric models to a dataset was, for the first time, formally posed as a consensus/biclustering problem. In this work, we build upon this framework, introducing a complete and comprehensive algorithmic pipeline for multiple parametric model estimation. The proposed approach preserves and considers all the information produced by Algorithm 1 (i.e., no averaging/pooling is performed). This information is then analyzed from a machine learning/optimization perspective, using a parameterless biclustering algorithm based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).\nContrarily to the main trends in the literature, the proposed modeling does not impose non-intersecting subsets Xi. Secondly, it exploits consistencies that naturally arise during the RANSAC execution, while explicitly avoiding spurious inconsistencies. This new formulation conceptually changes the way that the data produced by the popular RANSAC, and related model-candidate generation techniques, is analyzed.\nWith respect to our previous work [30, Section 5], the present work includes the following key differences and improvements:\n• We have streamlined the pre- and post-processing steps of the biclustering algorithm, simplifying algorithmic choices and unifying the pipeline for different types of parametric models; • No user intervention (i.e., no parameter tuning) is required to find the number of\nparametric models. During the biclustering process, this number is automatically determined using model selection techniques (i.e., minimum description length); • We accelerate the biclustering process introducing an accelerated algorithm to solve\nL1-based nonnegative matrix factorization (L1-NMF) problems. This allows to solve medium-sized problems faster while also extending the usability of the algorithm to much larger datasets. This contribution exceeds the context of this work, as this algorithm has potential applications in any other context where an L1-NMF is needed (e.g., traffic analysis [29], eldercare [29], shadow removal for face detection [36], video surveillance [36]).\nWe provide the complete source code of the proposed approach for generating all the examples presented in this work.1\nOrganization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the proposed biclustering approach for multiple parametric model estimation. In Section 3 we describe the fast version of the biclustering algorithm. We present diverse and extensive experimental results in Section 4 and finally provide some closing remarks in Section 5."

In the following, (X)ij , (X):j , (X)i: denote the (i, j)-th entry of X, the j-th column of X, and the i-th row of X, respectively.\nThe input of the algorithm is a pool U = {Cµ (X , θj , δ)}nj=1 of consensus sets (the output of Algorithm 1).\nDefinition 1 (Preference matrix) We define the m × n preference matrix A, whose rows and columns represent respectively the m = |X | data elements {xi}mi=1 and the n = |U| consensus sets, as\n(A)ij = { 1 if xi ∈ Cµ (X , θj , δ) ; 0 otherwise.\n(6)\nAn example of a preference matrix for a synthetic dataset can be seen in Figure 1. Traditionally, in algorithms like RANSAC, the preference matrix is (often implicitly) analyzed column-by-column or row-by-row. The preference matrix was explicitly introduced in the context of MPME in [31]. In the original formulation, the objects in X were clustered using the rows of A as feature vectors, obtaining a powerful state-of-the-art technique called J-linkage. An extension to work with a non-binary (using soft versus hard element-model membership) version of A was proposed in [20].\n1. https://github.com/marianotepper/arse\nAn alternative approach involves creating an m×m co-occurrence matrix, defined as\nB = 1n n∑ k=1 Bk, where (Bk)ij = { 1 if xi, xj ∈ Cµ (X , θk, δ) ; 0 otherwise.\n(7)\nThe matrix B is widely used in the context of ensemble clustering where it is built from clusters obtained from multiple clustering algorithms, instead of consensus sets. There are, within this research area, many algorithms to analyze B: from simple techniques such as applying a clustering algorithm to it (e.g., k-means, hierarchical or spectral clustering), to more complex matrix factorization techniques [e.g., 19]. It is important to point out that A contains more information than B. Noticing that\nB = 1n n∑ j=1 (A):j(A) T :j , (8)\nit becomes clear that the averaging operation implies the loss of critical information. In the vast majority of matrix factorization/clustering methods, the number of factors/clusters is a critical and hard-to-tune parameter. But this is in fact one of the parameters we are interested in discovering! In the context of MPME, matrix factorization has been recently applied [21] to a normalized version of B (using soft membership). Provided that the correct number of factors is selected, this method delivers state-of-the-art results.\nAn additional constraint common to all the aforementioned clustering/factorization approaches is that they provide a segmentation of the dataset elements. This means that these models do not correctly handle intersecting/overlapping models. As we will see next, this limitation is not present in the proposed formulation."

      "text" : "Our approach follows a different conceptual path, simultaneously analyzing the rows and columns of the preference matrix A. To explain the rationale behind our formulation, let us rewrite Equation (2) for clarity purposes:\nX =\n( r⋃\nk=1\nX̂k ) ∪ O with (∀k) X̂k ∩ O = ∅.\nAlgorithm 2: Random Sample Ensemble\ninput : set of objects X , parametric function fµ, inliers threshold δ. output : collection of inliers-model pairs {(Ct, θt)}Tt=1.\n1 Execute Algorithm 1 to obtain U ; 2 Form the preference matrix A from U (Definition 1); 3 Obtain T biclusters {(ut,vt)}Tt=1 from A (see Section 2.1 for details, note that T is\nautomatically estimated); 4 foreach ut do 5 Ct ← {xi ∈ X | (ut)i > 0}; 6 Estimate θt from Ct using least-squares, see Equation (5); 7 Re-compute Ct as Cµ (X , θt, δ), see Equation (4);\nEach X̂k represents one of the ground truth groups that we are seeking to recover. We assume (∀k) |X̂k| ≥ b, where b is the minimum number of elements necessary to uniquely characterize a given parametric model.\nLet us assume that during the execution of Algorithm 1 we obtained several pure MSSs for some X̂k, i.e., Jk = {j | Xmms(j) ⊆ X̂k} (the index j corresponds to the iterations of Algorithm 1). Then, for almost all j, j′ ∈ Jk their respective models will be very similar, i.e., θj ≈ θj′ ; these models should also be similar to the model estimated from X̂k using least squares. Therefore their consensus sets should be similar, i.e., Cµ (X , θj , δ) ≈ Cµ ( X , θj′ , δ ) ≈ X̂k. From the definition of A, we can then write that\n(A):Jk = ûk1 T + Ok, (9)\nwhere ûk is a binary vector such that (∀j ∈ Jk) (A):j ≈ ûk, 1 is the “all ones” vector of size |Jk|, and Ok accounts for all the errors in this approximation. Finally, as we look to represent all columns of A, we can rewrite the above equation, adding the corresponding zeros, as A = ûkv̂ T k +Ok, where v̂k is a binary vector of size n such that (∀j ∈ Jk) (v̂j)i = 1 and Ok is now of size m× n. We can then extend this representation to all ground truth groups X̂k, by writing\nA = r∑\nk=1\nûkv̂ T k + O, (10)\nwhere ûk ∈ {0, 1}m, v̂k ∈ {0, 1}n and again O accounts for all errors in the approximation. Notice that Equation (10) allows to cast the problem of analyzing the output of Algorithm 1 in terms of a biclustering problem.\nOnce the biclusters of A have been identified, we can obtain the consensus sets and, from them, estimate the final output models. See Algorithm 2 for a full description of this process. The next question now is: how do we find each bicluster?"

      "text" : "As usual in the optimization literature, the problem of finding û and v̂ in Equation (10) is easier to solve if we soften the binary constraints, imposing nonnegativity instead. The only missing component to formalize the problem is an appropriate prior for O. Since the\nerrors are also binary (and thus spurious), a reasonable choice would be to penalize its L1 norm. For convenience, we also drop the binary constraint on O. We can thus write the single-bicluster estimation problem as\nmin u,v ∥∥A− uvT −O∥∥2 F s.t. u ≥ 0,v ≥ 0, ‖O‖1 ≤ σ, (11)\nwhich, for some σ, is equivalent to our proposed formulation\nmin u,v ∥∥A− uvT∥∥ 1 s.t. u ≥ 0,v ≥ 0. (L1-NMF)\nWe use the L1 norm to cope with the impulsive nature of the errors in A. This formulation computes a robust median approximation to the preference matrix A, which carries all the needed information. Any standard NMF algorithm can be adapted to use the L1 norm and solve (L1-NMF). The algorithm in [30, App. A] delivers high-quality solutions at the expense of a higher computational cost. In this work, for the sake of speed, we use the following procedure:\n1. Find initializations for u and v using the iterative re-weighting scheme in [15]. In our experiments, this method proved to be rather fast for small-scale problems, but more inaccurate than other alternatives. This makes it a good choice for initialization.\n2. Given the initialization u, solve the convex problem minv≥0 ∥∥Du (A− uvT)∥∥1, using\nthe ADMM technique in [30, App. A] (Dx is a diagonal matrix with the indicator vector 1[x>0] in its diagonal). 3. Given the new value of v, solve the convex problem minu≥0 ∥∥(A− uvT)Dv∥∥1, using\nthe same technique as before.\nThe method in [15] is not particularly well suited for large-scale problems, as it deals with dense weighting matrices with the size of A. As this size increases, handling these matrices becomes computationally prohibitive. Section 3 is devoted to present a new technique to accelerate the above algorithm, rendering it capable of handling large-scale instances and producing a novel efficient L1-NMF solver."

      "text" : "A challenge with biclustering (as with classical clustering) is that the number of biclusters is not an easy parameter to set or to estimate in advance. Following a standard approach in the literature [22, 32] we sieve the information in a sequential way. Generically, we iterate two steps until some stopping criterion is met: (1) find one bicluster (u,v), and (2) subtract the information encoded by (u,v) from A.\nAlgorithm 3 summarizes the proposed biclustering approach. In Line 6 we set to zero the columns corresponding to the active set of vt. This enforces disjoint active sets between the successive vt, and hence orthogonality. This also ensures that non-negativity is maintained throughout the iterations. The proposed algorithm is very efficient, simple to code, and demonstrated to work well in the experimental results that we will present later.\nThe iterations should stop (1) when A is empty (Line 3), or (2) when A only contains noise (no structured patterns).

Indeed, lines 3 and 7 only provide a rough stopping criterion when At+1 is empty or when the bicluster is not the product of a consensus between at least two models. This criterion will output more models than needed, and this section is devoted to prune the collection {(ut,vt)}Tt=1.\nFor each bicluster, we are only interested in the support of its vectors ut and vt (which are sparse by design). We can then binarize them to avoid being mislead by small numerical inaccuracies that might have occurred during the optimization procedure, i.e., ut = butcγ and vt = bvtcγ , where\n(bxcγ)i = { 1 if (x)i > γ · ‖x‖∞ ; 0 otherwise.\n(12)\nIn practice, we set γ = 10−4 once and for all the tests in this paper.\nWe now pose the following model selection problem: given the biclusters {(ut,vt)}Tt=1 and the remainders {At+1}Tt=1 (which are binary by definition), find the value K in [1, T ] such that the preference matrix A is optimally described by A ≈ ∑K t=1 utv T t + AK+1.

      "text" : "The standard random sampling approach (Algorithm 1) to multiple model estimation generates many good model instances (composed of inliers), but also generates many bad models (composed mostly of outliers). In general, the number of bad models exceeds by far the number of good ones. It is not worth devoting computational effort to the analysis of these columns of A. Any pattern-discovery technique, such as the biclustering approach presented in the previous section, would benefit from having a simple, efficient, and statistically meaningful method for discarding bad models. These models will typically contain only a handful of objects. The question is how do we determine the minimum size for a good consensus set? This important computational contribution, based on the a contrario testing mechanism presented in depth in [12], is addressed next.\nLet us assume that we have a set X of random elements. Let µ(θ) be a model with an associated consensus set Cµ(X , θ, δ), built with tolerance δ (Equation (4), Page 2). We will assume, under the background model, that all objects are i.i.d. and that the error in Equation (3) locally follows an uniform distribution; this type of simple approximations has proven successful for outlier rejection [12]. Let κ be a locality parameter. If there are |Cµ (X , θ, δ)| elements at a distance δ from µ(θ), we expect to have in average κ times more elements at a distance κδ. We are interested in computing the probability that Cµ(X , θ, δ) has at least mδ elements given that Cµ(X , θ, κδ) contains mκδ elements. The probability of such an event is B (mκδ − b,mδ − b; p), where B is the binomial tail and p = δ/κδ = κ−1 is the probability that a random object belongs to the consensus set Cµ(X , θ, δ) given that it belongs to Cµ(X , θ, κδ). Recall that b is the minimum number of elements necessary to uniquely characterize a given parametric model. As such, b elements in Cµ(X , θ, κδ) are necessarily non-random, since they were used to estimate µ(θ). This is the reason behind subtracting b elements from mκδ and mδ.\nDefinition 2 Let µ(θ) be a model instance, Cµ(X , θ, δ) be its associated consensus set, obtained with precision parameter δ, and κ > 1 be a locality parameter. We define the number of false Alarms (NFA) of model instance µ(θ) as\nNFAµ,δ,κ(X , θ) = Ntests · B ( |Cµ (X , θ, κδ)| − b, |Cµ (X , θ, δ)| − b;κ−1 ) , (15)\nwhere Ntests = ( m b ) represents the total number of possible models. We say that the model µ(θ) is said to be ε-meaningful if\nNFAµ,δ,κ(X , θ) < ε. (16)\nIt is easy to prove, by the linearity of expectation, that the expected number of ε-meaningful models in a finite set of random models is smaller than ε. Alternatively, Ntests can be empirically set by analyzing a training dataset [6], providing a tighter bound for the expectation.\nDefinition 2 provides a formal probabilistic method for testing if a model is likely to happen at random or not. From a statistical viewpoint, the method goes back to multiple hypothesis testing. Following an a contrario reasoning [12], we decide whether the event of interest has occurred if it has a very low probability of occurring by chance in the above defined random (background) model. In other words, a model instance µ(θ) is ε-meaningful if |Cµ(X , θ, δ)| is sufficiently large to have NFAµ,δ,κ(X , θ) < ε. We only keep columns of A corresponding ε-meaningful model instances. We set ε = 1 for all the experiments.\nAs a result of this statistical validation procedure, the preference matrix A is considerably shrunk (the actual size reduction will depend on the inliers-outliers ratio and the number of model instances in the dataset). This shrunk preference matrix is fed to the biclustering algorithm (Algorithm 3), gaining in stability of the results as well as in speed.\nNote 1 There are techniques in the literature [e.g., 7], which follow a different route: instead of sampling first and prune later, they try to dynamically sample good models from the start. These techniques have proven successful in reducing the number of required samples but operate at a much slower rate per sample. Their dynamic nature makes parallelization more difficult and limited. In our view, a detailed comparison between these paradigms is needed, with special consideration given to the use of parallelization (e.g., GPUs)."

In short, a good model should separate itself from the background noise regardless of its intersection with other models. The exclusion principle described in [12, Chapter 6] performs this check. It states that, given two groups obtained by the same detector, no point x is allowed to belong to both groups. In our case, since we are explicitly modeling overlaps between groups, we use a milder version of this principle: we simply ask that any point can only contribute to the NFA of at most one group. This is explained in Algorithm 4. Notice that the order in which the inliers-models pairs are explored affects the result; we sort the biclusters according to their total size ‖ut‖0 · ‖vt‖0 (Equation (12)).\nOptionally and if required by the application, as the last step in our post-processing chain, we can force the models to have an empty intersection.

We say that B is well conditioned if α and β are low degree polynomials in r, independent of m and n.\nDefinition 5 ([26]) Given a well-conditioned basis B for the range of A ∈ Rm×n, we define the `1 leverage scores of A as the m-dimensional vector λ, with elements (λ)i = ‖(B):i‖1.\nThe leverage scores of A can be found with the following procedure [9, 26]: 1. build an FCT matrix Π ∈ Rr×m; 2. find a matrix R such that ΠAR is orthonormal; 3. using Definition 5, compute the leverage scores λ of B = AR† (R† denotes the pseudoinverse of R); The leverage scores are used in [9, 26] to speed up the algorithmic solution of x∗ = argminx ‖Ax− b‖1. For this, the authors build a diagonal matrix E, i.e., a compression matrix, by sampling its diagonal entries independently according to a set of probabilities pi that are proportional to the `1 leverage scores of A. Then, given x̂ = argminx ‖E(Ax̂− b)‖1 we have that ‖Ax̂− b‖1 ≤ (1 + ) ‖Ax∗ − b‖1 for some small . Key to the speedup is the size reduction of the regression problem, since only a few rows of A are kept in EA and considered to find x̂."

      "text" : "We now have all the elements that we need to build a fast algorithm for solving Problem (L1NMF). Considering that we are dealing with a biconvex problem, it is a standard practice to find a solution to it by alternating two `1 least squares problems,\nû = arg min u ∥∥A− uv̂T∥∥ 1 s.t. u ≥ 0, (22a)\nv̂ = arg min v ∥∥A− ûvT∥∥ 1 s.t. v ≥ 0. (22b)\nEach sub-problem can be sped up by respectively compressing the rows and the columns of A. Similarly as in the regression case, row (resp. column) compression is achieved through the computation of the leverage scores of A (resp. AT). Let C and R be the matrices that perform row and column compression, respectively. We can then iterate the compressed least squares problems\nû = arg min u ∥∥(A− uv̂T)C∥∥ 1 s.t. u ≥ 0, (23a)\nv̂ = arg min v ∥∥R (A− ûvT)∥∥ 1 s.t. v ≥ 0. (23b)\nThis would already give a very efficient algorithm for solving the problem of interest. In our experiments, we found that augmenting the procedure described in Page 7 with the above described compression techniques was faster and produced good results. We thus obtain the following accelerated procedure for solving Problem (L1-NMF):\n1. Given a column compression matrix C for A, find an initialization for u by solving the compressed problem\nû, v̂ = argmin u,ṽ\n∥∥AC− uṽT∥∥ 1 s.t. u ≥ 0, ṽ ≥ 0, (24)\nwith the iterative re-weighting scheme in [15]. The compressed vector v̂ has no further use in our algorithm. 2. Given the initialization û and a row compression matrix Rû for DûA (Dx is a diagonal matrix with the vector 1[x>0] in its diagonal.), solve the compressed convex problem\nminv≥0 ∥∥RûDû (A− ûvT)∥∥1, using the ADMM technique in [30, App. A].\n3. Given the new value of v and a column compression matrix Cv for ADv, solve the compressed convex problem minu≥0 ∥∥(A− uvT)DvCv∥∥1, using the same technique as before. All compression matrices are computed with the same compression level r, used to build the FCT matrix. We also found in our experimental results that instead of using random sampling for building the row and column compression matrices, as in [9], good results were obtained by simply selecting the r largest leverage scores."

      "heading" : "4. Experimental results",
      "text" : "In the following, we refer to the proposed Random Sample Ensemble as RSE and to its compressed version, Accelerated Random Sample Ensemble, as ARSE. In our experiments, we compared the quantitative results of both methods, but only present qualitative results for ARSE. All the parameters for RSE and ARSE are exactly the same and in each figure/table we specify δ (Equation (4)); unless specified, κ = 3 (Definition 2). The only exception is the compression rate in ARSE, which will be set to h = 32 in all experiments, see Equation (17).\nEvaluation. To measure performance, we use the standard precision and recall. In order to compute these measures, we compute an optimal assignment between the ground truth and the tested groups, using the Hungarian algorithm. Once the two sets of groups are appropriately matched, we can then compute the precision and the recall of the tested groups in a standard fashion.\nIf models are not allowed to share elements, it is not unusual in the literature to consider the outliers as an additional ground truth group to recover; in this case, the misclassification error is often reported.\nIn the general case where models overlap, we also use, as an additional measure, the generalized normalized mutual information (GNMI) [16], which extends the normalized mutual information (also called symmetric uncertainty) [33, p. 310] to the case of groups with overlaps.\n2D lines and circles. We start our experimental evaluation with a few small synthetic datasets [31] where 2D points are arranged forming lines and circles. The results are shown in figures 3 and 4, where ARSE clearly detects the correct models in each case. In Table 1 we compare the performance of RSE and ARSE in all these datasets. As expected, when the dataset (and the preference matrix) are rather small, ARSE is only slightly faster than\nRSE; however, as the dataset gets larger (e.g., Figure 3(h)), ARSE becomes significantly faster than RSE.\nRegarding the accuracy of both methods, RSE and ARSE are virtually equal for the examples in Figure 3, except in figures 3(i) and 3(j), where RSE performs slightly better. We also observe in figures 3 and 4 that the proposed approach can correctly recover overlapping models. This is an intrinsic limitation of previous state-of-the-art competitors such as Jlinkage [31], T-linkage [20], RPA [21] and most multiple model estimation techniques, which are generally based on partitioning (clustering) the dataset.\nVanishing points. Under the assumption of perspective projection (e.g., with a pinhole camera), sets of parallel lines in 3D space are projected into a 2D image as a set of concurrent lines. The point in the image plane at which these lines meet is called a vanishing point. Vanishing points provide important information to make inferences about the 3D structures of a scene from its 2D (projected) image. Since these projections are non-invertible, concurrence in the image plane does not necessarily imply parallelism in 3D. This said, the counterexamples for this implication are rare in real images, and the problem of finding parallel lines in 3D is reduced in practice to finding vanishing points in the image plane [e.g., 3, 4, 11, 18, 28]. We are here interested in finding vanishing points when no a priori information is known about the image or the camera with which it was taken.\nThe dataset elements in this case are line segments extracted with a suitable algorithm (e.g., [14]). As the distance between a vanishing point and a line segment, we consider the angular difference between the line segment and the line joining the vanishing point and the segment’s midpoint.\nTo evaluate the proposed framework for the task of detecting vanishing points, we use the York Urban database [11], which comes with ground truth assignments of image segments to three orthogonal directions in 3D. Of course, since the dataset images represent urban scenes, performance can be readily boosted by adding problem-specific constraints to the proposed algorithm as an extra postprocessing step; common simplifications include knowledge about the camera calibration and the Manhattan world assumption [e.g., 18].\nThe results of the proposed method are presented in Table 2. There we can observe that RSE and ARSE perform well in terms of precision and recall. ARSE is in average twice as fast as RSE. In Figure 5 we can observe a few characteristic examples of ARSE’s results. Notice that in the two rightmost examples, the method correctly finds more than three vanishing points; these additional points are deemed incorrect in the results of Table 2, as the ground truth only contemplates three points.\nFundamental matrices and homographies. For these examples, where we are trying to estimate geometric transforms between two images, the base elements are keypoint matches. Any modern method to find those matches would work relatively well for our purposes; we use BRISK [17]. We show in Figure 6 two examples of fundamental matrix estimation on a stereo pair of images. The only motion in the scene corresponds to a change in camera perspective, and it can be described with a single fundamental matrix. Both\nmethods achieve extremely similar results and in both cases (left and right pairs) they find a single model. The example on the left contains 2518 matches. ARSE detects 1377 matches in 7.99 seconds, while RSE detects 1363 matches in 98.32 seconds. ARSE’s precision and recall, considering the result of RSE as ground truth, are 0.959 and 0.968, respectively. The example on the right contains 8999 matches. ARSE detects 5533 matches in 30.40 seconds, whereas RSE detects 5537 matches in 1033.45 seconds. In this case, the precision is 0.959 and recall is 0.968. However, there is a huge difference in speed between both methods, which is accentuated with the size of the dataset. On the left example, ARSE is about 12 times faster, whereas on the right example it is about 34 times faster.\nIt is important to emphasize that other random sampling techniques can be used beyond the baseline in Algorithm 1. To show this, we have included experiments using the state-ofthe-art MultiGS algorithm [7]. It is worth pointing out that a recent technique [5] has been able to reduce the size of the minimal sample set for fundamental matrices to b = 2; its use would significantly reduce the computational complexity of the sampling step, imposing an upper bound of O(m2) to the total number of possible combinations.\nWe estimate multiple fundamental matrices (moving camera and moving objects) and multiple homographies (moving planar objects) on the images in the AdelaideRMF dataset [34]. Although we use this dataset because it is standard in the literature [e.g., 20, 21, 23, 34], we would like to point out that the ground truth of this dataset contains a nonnegligible quantity of severe errors. In Figure 7 we show two examples where these errors are easily identified upon visual inspection. The dataset’s ground truth would need a thorough revision to be truly useful as a scientific benchmark. We include these results nonetheless for the sake of completeness.\nThe results on the full dataset are presented in Figure 8. We include comparisons with T-linkage [20], RCMSA [23], and RPA [21]. Among these three methods, RPA is the one that achieves the best performances; however, to yield these performances RPA uses as an input the ground truth number of models to estimate. The other methods, as the proposed method, automatically estimate this number.\nIn Figure 8(a), RSE and ARSE perform on average similarly as T-linkage. However, notice that the median performance of ARSE is similar to the one of RPA, with the added benefit of not having to tune a critical and fundamental parameter. In Figure 8(b), both RSE and ARSE clearly outperform all other methods. The complete numerical results are included in tables 3 and 4.\n3D planes estimation. In recent years, people have started “scanning” objects with range imaging hardware (e.g., Kinect or RealSense cameras) to obtain 3D point clouds. The geometric nature of man-made objects (composed of planes, cylinders, spheres, etc.) is very well adapted to the analysis of their corresponding point clouds with MPME.\nAs an example, we show the capabilities of our method in this setting with the detection of 3D planes on the Pozzovegianni dataset.2 In this case, the 3D points are obtained from different images of a building (Figure 9(a)) with a sparse multi-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method recovers the 3D planes in the scene and properly reconstructs the building structure. We evaluate our results on four different versions of the dataset, using 10%, 20%, 50%, and 100% the points. In Figure 10(a), we show the estimated planes on the first (10%) and last (100%) versions. Both results are very similar except for the bell tower, which is correctly recovered in the latter case but not in the former (mainly because there are not enough points for a proper estimation).\n2. http://www.diegm.uniud.it/fusiello/demo/samantha/\nThe experimental setup used in the above paragraph provides a good opportunity to measure the speed difference between RSE and ARSE, see Figure 11(a). ARSE is faster than RSE for small datasets, as in all the previous examples; however, the speed difference is not as striking (2.4 times faster when using 10% of the points). When working with increasingly bigger datasets, this difference becomes more and more pronounced (60 times faster when using 100% of the points), see the left plot in Figure 11(a). The other appealing quality of ARSE is that its speed scales very gracefully with the preference matrix size, see the right plot in Figure 11(a).\nWe ran the same experiment on the Piazza Bra dataset,3 see Figure 12. We only ran RSE on the dataset versions that include 10% and 20% of the points, because of RAM memory issues. Notice that ARSE with a 82831 × 24841 preference matrix is faster than RSE with a 16567×2040 preference matrix (the former matrix being about 61 times bigger than the latter)."

      "text" : "In this work we introduced a complete and comprehensive algorithmic pipeline for multiple parametric model estimation. The proposed approach takes the information produced by a random sampling algorithm (e.g., RANSAC) and analyzes it from a machine learning/optimization perspective, using a parameterless biclustering algorithm based on L1 nonnegative matrix factorization (L1-NMF).\nThis new formulation conceptually changes the way that the data produced by the popular RANSAC, or related model-candidate generation techniques, is analyzed. It exploits\n3. See Footnote 2\nconsistencies that naturally arise during the RANSAC execution, while explicitly avoiding spurious inconsistencies. Additionally and contrarily to the main trends in the literature, the proposed modeling does not impose non-intersecting parametric models.\nWe also presented an accelerated version of the biclustering process, introducing an accelerated algorithm to solve L1-NMF problems. This allows to solve medium-sized problems faster while also extending the usability of the algorithm to much larger datasets. We emphasize that this contribution exceeds the context of this work, as this accelerated algorithm has potential applications in any other context where an L1-NMF is needed.\nAs a future line of research, we are currently investigating whether using a hard thresholding scheme is actually necessary. Instead of working with binary data, we could work with a real-valued object-model distance matrix, eliminating a critical parameter that has been haunting the RANSAC framework for years."

The proposed approach analyzes the information produced by a random sampling algorithm (e.g., RANSAC) from a machine learning/optimization perspective, using a parameterless biclustering algorithm based on L1 nonnegative matrix factorization (L1-NMF). The proposed framework exploits consistent patterns that naturally arise during the RANSAC execution, while explicitly avoiding spurious inconsistencies. Contrarily to the main trends in the literature, the proposed technique does not impose non-intersecting parametric models. A new accelerated algorithm to compute L1-NMFs allows to handle medium-sized problems faster while also extending the usability of the algorithm to much larger datasets. This accelerated algorithm has applications in any other context where an L1-NMF is needed, beyond the biclustering approach to parameter estimation here addressed. We accompany the algorithmic presentation with theoretical foundations and numerous and diverse examples.",
