      "text" : "Real-world computer vision systems are increasingly required to provide robust real-time performance under memory and bandwidth constraints for tasks such as tracking, on-the-fly object detection, and visual search. Robots with visual sensors may be required to perform all of these tasks while interacting with their environment. On another extreme, IP cameras, life logging devices, and other visual sensors may want to hold a summary of the data stream seen over a long time. Hence, new algorithms that enable real-world computer vision applications under a tight space-time budget are a necessity. In this paper, we propose new algorithms with low space-time complexity for learning from streaming visual data, inspired by research in computational geometry.\nIn recent years, computational geometry researchers have proposed techniques to obtain small representative sets of points from larger sets with constant or logarithmic space-time complexity [6], [14], [16]. We propose to adapt these techniques to retain a summary of visual data and train object appearance models in constant time and space from this summary. Specifically, we perform summarization of a video stream based on “coresets”, which are defined as a small set of points that approximately maintain the properties of the original set with respect to the distance between the set and other structures in its ambient space with theoretical guarantees [18]. We demonstrate that the coreset formulation is useful for learning object appearance models for detection and tracking. Coresets have been primarily used as a technique to convert “big data” into manageable sizes [27]. In contrast, we employ coresets for reducing small data to “tiny data”, and perform real-time classifier training.\nWe use the object appearance model learned from the coreset representation, for visual tracking by detection.\n• Abhimanyu Dubey is an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India. • Rahul Sukthankar is a research scientist at Google. • Nikhil Naik, Dan Raviv, and Ramesh Raskar are with the Media Labora-\ntory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nTracking systems typically retain just an appearance model for the object [20], [35] and optionally, data from some prior frames [15], [31]. In contrast, we compute a summary of all the previous frames in constant time (on average) and update our appearance model continuously with this summary. The summarization process improves the appearance model with time. As a result, our method is beneficial for tracking objects in very long video sequences that need to deal with variation in lighting, background, and object appearance, along with the object leaving and re-entering the video.\nWe demonstrate the potential of this technique with a simple tracker that combines detections from a linear SVM trained from the coreset with a Kalman filter. We call this no-frills tracker the “Coreset Adaptive Tracker (CAT).” CAT obtains competitive performance on three standard datasets, the CVPR2013 Tracking Benchmark [33], the Princeton Tracking Benchmark [30], and the TLD Dataset [21]. Our method is found to be superior to popular methods for tracking longer video sequences from the TLD dataset.\nWe must emphasize that the primary goal of this paper is not to develop the best algorithm for tracking—which is evident from our simple design. Rather, our goal is to demonstrate the potential of coresets as a data reduction technique for learning from visual data. We summarize our contributions below."

      "text" : "First, we introduce the literature on coresets, followed by a summary of the prior art on online learning for tracking by detection.\nCoresets and Data Reduction: The term coreset was first introduced by Agarwal et al. [2] in their seminal work on k-median and k-means problems. Badoiu et al. [6] propose a coreset for clustering using a subset of input points to generate the solution, while Har-Peled and Mazumdar [18] provide a different solution for coreset construction which includes points that may not be a subset of the original set. Feldman et al. [13] demonstrate that a weak coreset can be generated independent of number of points in the data or their feature dimensions. We follow the formulation of Feldman et al. [14], which provides an eminently parallelizable streaming algorithm for coreset construction with a theoretical error bound. This formulation has been recently used for applications in robotics [12] and for summarization of time series data [27].\nOnline Learning for Detection and Tracking: The problem of object tracking by detection has been well studied in computer vision [29]. Early important examples of learning based methods include [8], [11], [20]. Ross et al. [28] learn a low dimensional subspace representation of object appearance using incremental algorithms for PCA. Li et al. [24] propose a compressive sensing tracking method using efficient l1 norm minimization. Discriminative algorithms solve the tracking problem using a binary classification model for object appearance. Avidan [3] combines optical flow with SVMs and performs tracking by minimizing the SVM classification score, and extends this method with an “ensemble tracker” using Adaboost [4]. Grabner et al. [17] develop a semi-supervised boosting framework to tackle the problem of drift due to incorrect detections. Kwon et al. [22] represent the object using multiple appearance models, obtained from sparse PCA, which are integrated using an MCMC framework. Babenko et al. [5] introduce the semi-supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithm. Hare et al. [19] learn an online structured output SVM classifier for adaptive tracking. Zhang et al. [34] develop an object appearance model based on efficient feature extraction in the compressed domain and use the features discriminatively to separate the object from its background. Kalal et al. [21] introduce the TLD algorithm, where a pair of “expert” learners select positive and negative examples in a semi-supervised manner for real-time tracking. Gao et al. [15] combine results of a tracker learnt using prior knowledge from auxiliary samples and another tracker learnt with samples from recent frames. Our work contributes to this literature with a novel coreset representation for model-based tracking."

Specifically, we call Ã a ‘coreset’ of A if\n(1− )dist2(A,S) ≤ dist2(Ã, S) + c ≤ (1 + )dist2(A,S), (1)\nwhere dist2(A,S) denotes the sum of squared distances from each row onA to its closest point in S and c is constant. Eq. (1) can be rewritten in a matrix form using the Frobenius norm [14] as\n(1− )‖AY ‖2F ≤ ‖ÃY ‖2F + c ≤ (1 + )‖AY ‖2F , (2)\nwhere Y is a d× (d− k) orthogonal matrix. Going forward we denote Ã ≈ A if Ã is a (1 + )-approximation of A. The best low dimensional approximation can be obtained by calculating the k dimensional eigen-structure, e.g., using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Several results have been recently proposed for obtaining a low rank approximation of the data for summarization more efficiently than SVD. However, very few of these algorithms are designed for a streaming setting [10], [14], [16], [26].\nMotivated by [14], we adopt a tree formulation to approximate the low rank subspace which best represents the data. Unlike other methods, the tree formulation has sufficiently low time complexity for a real-time learner, considering the constants. Using this formulation, the time complexity for the summarization and learning steps is constant (on average) in between observations. In the next section we formalize and prove time and space guarantees for this approach."

      "text" : "The key idea here is that a low rank approximation can be “approximated” using a merge-and-reduce technique. The origin of this approach goes back to Bentley and Saxe [7], and was further adopted for coresets in [2]. In this work, following Feldman et al. [14], we generate a tree structure, which holds a summary of the streaming data.\nWe denote Ci ∈ Rn×d as a leaf in the tree constructed from n rows of d dimensional features. The total number of data points captured until time t is marked by p(t). For ease of calculations, we define 2q(t) = p(t)n . Thus, bq(t)c is the depth of the tree in time t. We construct a binary tree from the streaming data, and compress the data by merging the leaves, whenever two adjacent leaves get formed at the same level. If p(t) = n2q0 , only the root node remains in memory after repeated merging of leaves. For the next n2q0 streamed points, the right side of the binary tree keeps growing and merging, until it is reduced to a single node again, when n2q0+1 data points arrive (Figure 1).\nIf Ci and Cj are two (1 + ) coresets then their concatenation [ Ci Cj ] is also an (1 + ) coreset.

Whenever two coreset nodes are present at the same level, they are merged to construct a higher level coreset (shown in green). The nodes that have been merged are deleted from the memory (shown in red). We prove in Section 3 that the space requirement for tree construction is O(log p(t)) in the worst case, where p(t) is the number of data points at time t, and on average the time complexity is constant per time step.\nthe proof follows trivially from the definition of a coreset. This identity implies that two nodes which are (1 + ) approximation can be concatenated and then re-compressed back to size n. This is a key feature of the tree formulation, which repeatedly performs compression from 2n×d to n×d. Each computation can be considered constant in time and space. However, this formulation also reduces the quality of the approximation, since the merged coreset is an (1 + )2 approximation of the two nodes. For every level of the tree, a multiplication error of (1 + ) is introduced from the leaf node to the root."

The space complexity to hold a 2∪tCi tree in memory is O(ndq(t)), where n is the size of the coreset of points with dimension d.\nProof. In a coreset tree, two children of the same parent node cannot be in the memory stack simultaneously, which\nimplies that, between two full collapses of the tree, the memory stack is increased at most by O(nd), which is the size of one leaf. Hence, the space complexity S(t) can be derived as follows –\nS(n2q(t)) = 1\nS(p(t)) ≤ nd+max p̂(t) S(p̂(t)) (5) n2q(t)−1 < p̂(t) < n2q(t) & n2q(t) < p(t) < n2q(t)+1\nThis recursive formulation results in a space requirement of S(p) ≤ O(nd log(p(t)/n)) = O(ndq(t)). Assuming n and d are constants chosen a priori, the complexity of the memory is logarithmic in the number of points seen so far.\nTheorem 3. The time complexity of coreset tree construction between time step t and t+1 is O(log(p(t)/n)nd2) in the worst case, which is logarithmic in p, the total number of points.\nProof. In the worst case, we perform log(p(t)/n) compressions from the lower level all the way to the root. The compressions are performed using SVD. Since the time complexity of each SVD algorithm is O(nd2), assuming n > d,\nT (t+ 1)− T (t) ≤ O(log(p(t)/n)nd2) = O(q(t)nd2) = O(q(t)), (6)\nwhere n and d are considered constants.\nThis scenario occurs for the last data point of a perfect subtree (p(t) = n2q(t)).\nFinally we wish to explore the total and average time complexity to summarize p points. On average, the time complexity is constant and does not depend on p.\nTheorem 4. The time complexity for a complete collapse of a tree to a single coreset of size n × d is O(pd2), where d the dimension of each point and p is the number of points. The average time complexity per point is constant.\nProof. p points are split into p/n leaves with n×d dimension each. The time complexity of SVD is O(nd2), assuming n > d. A total of p(t)/n SVDs will be computed for compressing a perfect tree. Hence the total time complexity T (t) for all cycles until time t becomes\nT (t) = O ( p(t)\nn nd2\n) = O(p(t)d2) = O(p(t)) (7)\nassuming d is constant. We further infer that the average time complexity T̂ (t) is O(1) as\nT̂ (t) = T (t)\np(t) = O\n( p(t)d2\np(t)\n) = O(d2) = O(1). (8)"

This is not ideal for training a tracking system, since more recent frames should have a representation in the learning process. To account for recent data, we propose an hierarchical sampling of the entire tree, constructing an (at most) 2n×d-size summarization of the data seen until a given time. For each SC [i] we calculate wi = 2(level(SC [i])−level(top(SC)), and select the first nwi elements from SC [i].

      "text" : "In the first frame , user input is used to select a region of interest (ROI) for the object to be tracked. We resize the ROI to a 64 × 64 square from which we extract 2 × 2 HOG features from the RGB channels. We also extract HoG features from small affine transformations of the input frame and add them to our frame stack. The affine transformations include scaling, translation and rotation. The number of affine transformations are determined by the number of additional frames required to make the frame stack size reach a maximum of 25% of the total video length. For example, if the coreset size is 5% of the total length of the video, we add 4 transformations per frame. This process gives us the advantage of having more—albeit synthetically generated—samples to train the classifier, and makes the tracker robust to small object scale changes and translations.\nInitially, since no coreset appearance model has been trained, we need to use an alternate method for tracking (we use SCM [35] in our current implementation). Once first n frames have been tracked, the first leaf of the tree is formed. Data classification, compression, and training now run in parallel (Figure 2). These components are summarized below – • Classification: Detect the object in the stream from the\nlast trained classifier. • Compression: Update a coreset tree, by inserting new\nleaves and summarizing data whenever possible. • Training: Train an SVM classifier from the hierarchical\ncoreset appearance model.\nClassification If a classifier has been trained, we feed each sliding window to the classifier and obtain a confidence value. After hard thresholding and non-maximum suppression, we detect an ROI. To remove noise in the position of the ROI, we employ a Kalman filter. We use Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain its parameters from the centers of the returned predictions of the previous n frames. The EM returns learnt parameters for prediction, which are used to estimate the latent position of the bounding box center. This latent position is used to update the Kalman filter parameters for the next iteration. Once the center of the bounding box is obtained, we calculate the true ROI. We extract features from the ROI and feed it to a feature stack SP . Until the first n frames arrive we obtain the ROI from SCM [35] since no classifier has been trained. This process continues till the last frame.\nCompression If |SP | > n, we pop the top n elements SP,n from the feature stack and push a coreset node containing elements SP,n into the coreset stack SC with level = 0. If level(SC [i]) = level(SC [i + 1]), they are merged by constructing a coreset from SC [i] and SC [i+ 1]. We store the coreset in SC [i], and delete SC [i+1]. The level for node SC [i] is increased by one. This process continues recursively.\nTraining If at least one leaf has been constructed and the size of the coreset stack changes, we train a one-class linear SVM using samples from SC .

Tables 2, 5, and 6 show that CAT 25 significantly outperforms the state of the art, including methods like TGPR [15], which perform better than CAT on the CVPR2013 Tracking Benchmark. CAT 10 is placed third, and it’s success rate is similar to that of TLD. These results support our intuition that the ability of CAT to summarize all data provides a boost in performance over long videos."

For a linear\nSVM implementation with linear time complexity [9], the learning time for training with all data points can become prohibitively large, in contrast to the constant, small time needed for learning from coresets. We pay for the reduced cost of training the learning algorithm by the additional time and space requirements of coreset tree formation. We prove in Section 3 that the time complexity of tree construction is constant on average. We validate this result empirically in Figure 6-(right). Other coreset formulations [16] may be used to reduce the space requirements to constant, at the cost of a higher value of the constant for time complexity."

We validate CAT versus random sampling and sub-sampling using the TLD dataset using multiple values of n, the coreset size. For random sampling (RS), we use n random frames from all the frames seen so far. For sub-sampling (SS), we use n uniformly spaced frames. CAT consistently outperform both RS and SS (Table 4). Thus, the summarization of data by coresets allows us to learn a more complex object appearance model as compared to sampling."

      "heading" : "5.7 Coreset Size Selection",
      "text" : "The coreset size n determines the time and space complexity of CAT. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of CAT at coreset sizes which are 10% (CAT 10) or 25% (CAT 25) of the total video size. Using such large values for coreset size is not a strict requirement, but rather an artifact of the datasets used for evaluation. A majority of videos in the three standard datasets are short—114 out of 155 videos have less than 400 frames. We model the object using dense HOG features, which leads to a very high dimensional representation. Hence, the SVM requires sufficient number of data points for good prediction on such short videos. We set n to 10% or 25% of the video size to obtain consistent performance across videos of various sizes.\nHowever, CAT maintains high detection accuracy with small coreset sizes as well. In Table 5, we evaluate CAT with various coreset sizes—1%, 2.5%, 5% and 10%—on the TLD dataset. Increasing the coreset size results in an increase in success rate for tracking, since the model captures more information about object appearance. However, the tracking performance is still satisfactory for coreset size as small as 1% of the video size, which is equal to 27 frames on average for the TLD dataset.\nFurthermore, CAT performs well, and in fact improves with time, on sufficiently long videos with small coreset sizes that are independent of the number of frames in a video. In Table 6, we compare the performance of CAT with fixed, small coreset size with two top performing methods on extremely long videos. We generate the extremely long videos from the four largest TLD videos by appending clips that are 10% in length of the original video. The clips are randomly flipped, time-reversed, shifted in contrast and brightness, translated by small amounts, and corrupted with Gaussian noise. CAT shows an increase in accuracy with increasing number of frames. In contrast, the success rate\n7\nof TLD and TGPR reduces with an increase in number of frames. The maximum coreset size in the 100K experiment is 2.5% of the original video. Yet CAT maintains excellent tracking accuracy.\nIn summary, the impressive performance of CAT—a simple tracker based on appearance models trained with small coreset sizes—in these two experiments demonstrates the utility of the coreset formulation."

Our method can retain a summary of all frames seen so far using logarithmic space with an efficient algorithm. This is an important advantage for practical systems with space and time constraints.\nSimplicity: The utility of the coreset formulation is evident from the fact that we obtain state of the art experimental results with a simple tracker that consists of a linear classifier and a Kalman filter. The primary goal of this work is to explore the benefit of coresets for learning from streaming visual data, rather than to compete on tracking benchmarks. Additional improvement could be obtained via choosing the optimal coreset size or exploring various hierarchical sampling methods. Performance may also improve by incorporating traditional methods for handling occlusion and drift.\nReal-time Performance: Our current implementation, running on commodity hardware (Intel i7 Processor, 8 GB RAM), performs coreset construction and SVM training in parallel at ∼20 FPS for small coreset sizes (n ≤ 64). Due to the high computational complexity of sliding window detection, the total speed is ∼3 FPS. Faster detection methods (e.g., efficient subwindow search [23] and parallelization [32]) can be easily incorporated into our system to achieve real-time performance."

Since we maintain a compact summary of all previous data, our learning model improves with time. We provide experimental validation for this insight with strong performance on the TLD dataset which contains videos with 2685 frames on average. The ideas described in this paper complement the current expertise in the computer vision community on developing trackers and detectors. Combining our framework with existing methods should lead to fruitful online approaches, particularly when ‘old’ data should be taken into account. While we explore the use of coresets for object tracking in this paper, we hope that our technique can be adapted for a variety of applications, such as image collection summarization, video summarization and more."

Specifically, we construct a “coreset” representation of streaming data using a parallelized algorithm, which is an approximation of a set with relation to the squared distances between this set and all other points in its ambient space. We learn an adaptive object appearance model from the coreset tree in constant time and logarithmic space and use it for object tracking by detection. Our method obtains excellent results for object tracking on three standard datasets over more than 100 videos. The ability to summarize data efficiently makes our method ideally suited for tracking in long videos in presence of space and time constraints. We demonstrate this ability by outperforming a variety of algorithms on the TLD dataset with 2685 frames on average. This coreset based learning approach can be applied for both real-time learning of small, varied data and fast learning of big data.",
