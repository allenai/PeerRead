      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are currently widely used for solving different Data Mining tasks due to their approximating capabilities and their ability to learn from experimental data [1-3]. However, when the data come sequentially in real time, many neural networks lose their effectiveness because of the multiepoch learning (which is used in many ANNs and designated only for a batch mode). Of course, radial-basis-function networks (RBFN) could be used in such situations. These ANNs are characterized by a high speed of learning processes, but, first of all, these networks suffer from the so-called «curse of dimensionality» and, secondly, even a trained neural network is a «black box», and its results can not be interpreted. Hybrid systems of computational intelligence [5-7], and above all neuro-fuzzy systems (NFSs), combining the advantages of ANNs and fuzzy inference systems (FISs), do not suffer from the “curse of dimensionality” and provide linguistic interpretability and transparency of the results. However, since most of the well-known NFSs are trained with the help of the error backpropagation concept, they are ill-equipped to work in an online mode.\nDue to the above mentioned problems, we would like to develop hybrid systems of computational intelligence that deal with processing the incoming data in an online mode and have advantages of both ANNs and NFSs.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a neo-fuzzy neuron architecture. Section 3 describes an extended neo-fuzzy neuron architecture. Section 4 presents experiments and evaluation. Conclusions and future work are given in the final section.\nII. THE NEO-FUZZY NEURON ARCHITECTURE\nTo overcome the above mentioned problems, a neuro-fuzzy system called by the authors a “neo-fuzzy neuron (NFN)” was introduced in [8 – 10]. The architecture of the neo-fuzzy neuron is in fig.1.\nFig.1. A neo-fuzzy neuron\nThe neo-fuzzy neuron is a nonlinear learning system with multiple inputs and one output that implements the mapping\n  1\nˆ n\ni i i y f x    (1)\nwhere ix is the i-th component of the n-dimensional input signal vector  1,..., ,..., T n\ni nx x x x R  , ŷ is a scalar NFN output. The NFN structural blocks are nonlinear synapses iNS that carry out a nonlinear transformation of the i-th component of ix in the form\n    1\nh\ni i li li i l f x w x    (2)\nwhere liw is the l-th synaptic weight of the i-th nonlinear synapse, 1, 2,...,l h , 1, 2,...,i n ;  li ix is the l-th membership function in the i-th nonlinear synapse performing fuzzification of a crisp component ix . Thus, transformation implemented by the NFN can be written as\n  1 1\nˆ n h\nli li i i l y w x     . (3) Fuzzy inference implemented by the same NFN has the form\nIF ix IS liX THEN THE OUTPUT IS , 1, 2,...,liw l h , (4) which means that a nonlinear synapse actually implements the zero-order Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference [11, 12]. The NFN authors [8–10] used traditional triangular constructions as membership functions that meet the unity partition conditions\n \n1, 1, 1,\n1, 1, 1,\n, ,\n, ,\n0\ni l i i l i li li l i\nl i i li i i li l i\nl i li\nx c if x c c c c c x\nx if x c c c c\notherwise\n\n  \n  \n              \n(5)\nwhere lic stands for arbitrarily selected (usually uniformly distributed) centers of the membership functions in the interval [0, 1] , thus, naturally 0 1ix  .\nSuch a choice of the membership functions leads to the fact that the i-th component of the input signal ix activates only two adjacent functions, thus their sum is equal to 1 which means that    1, 1li i l i ix x    (6) and\n     1, 1,i i li li i l i l i if x w x w x    . (7) Just exactly this circumstance allows to synthesize simple and effective adaptive controllers for nonlinear control objects [13, 14]. One can use other membership functions except triangular constructions, first of all, B-splines [15] that proved their effectiveness in the neo-fuzzy neurons [16]. A general case of the membership functions based on the q-th degree B-spline can be presented in the form\n   \n \n1,\n1,\n, 1,\n, 1,\n1 , 1,\n0\n, 1,\n, 1 1,\n1, 2,..., - .\ni li l i\nBi li B li i li i l q i li\nl q i i B l i i\nl q i l i\nif x c c for q\notherwise x c\nx qx q c c c x\nx q for q c c\nl h q\n\n\n\n \n \n \n          \n    \n     \n(8)\nWhen 2q  , we obtain the traditional triangular functions. It should be mentioned that B-splines also provide the unity partition in the form\n  1\n, 1 h\nB li i l x q   ,\nthey are non-negative which means that  , 0Bli ix q  and have a local support  , 0Bli ix q  for ,,i li l q ix c c     .\nWhen the vector signal         1 ,..., ,..., T\ni nx k x k x k x k ( 1,2,...k  – the current discrete time) is fed to the NFN input, a scalar value is calculated at the NFN output\n       1 1\nˆ 1 n h\nli li i i l y k w k x k     (9)\nwhere  1liw k  is the current value of adjusted synaptic weights that were obtained from a learning procedure of the previous  1k  observations.\nIntroducing a  1nh – membership functions vector            11 1 1 1 12 2,..., , ,...,hx k x k x k x k         ,..., Tli i hn nx k x k  and a corresponding synaptic weights vector\n          11 1 121 1 ,..., 1 , 1 ,..., 1 ,h liw k w k w k w k w k       , 1 T\nhnw k  , we can write the transformation (9) implemented by the NFN in a compact form\n      ˆ 1Ty k w k x k  . (10) To adjust the neo-fuzzy neuron parameters, the authors used a gradient procedure that minimizes the learning\ncriterion\n        \n    \n2 2\n2\n1 1\n1 1ˆ 2 2\n1 2\nn h\nli li i i l\nE k y k y k e k\ny k w x k  \n   \n     \n (11)\nand has the form                     \n          1 1\n1\nˆ1\n1\n1\nli li li i\nli li i\nli\nn h\nli li i li i i l\nw k w k e k x k\nw k y k y k x k\nw k\ny k w k x k x k\n \n \n    \n   \n    \n  \n       \n(12)\nwhere  y k is an external reference signal,  e k is a learning error,  is a learning rate parameter. A special algorithm was proposed in [17] to accelerate the NFN learning procedure which has both tracking (for non-stationary signal processing) and filtering properties (for \"noisy\" data processing)                   1 2 1 , 1 ,0 1. w k w k r k e k x k r k r k x k               (13)\nWhen 0  , the algorithm (13) is identical to the one-step Kaczmarz-Widrow-Hoff learning algorithm [18] and when 1  – to the Goodwin-Ramage-Caines stochastic approximation algorithm [19].\nIt should be mentioned that one can use many other learning and identification algorithms including the traditional least-squares method with all modifications to train the NFN synaptic weights.\nIII. AN EXTENDED NEO-FUZZY NEURON\nAs mentioned above, the NFN nonlinear synapse iNS implements the zero-order Takagi-Sugeno inference thus being the elementary Wang-Mendel neuro-fuzzy system [20–22]. It is possible to improve approximating properties of such a system by using a special structural unit which we called an “extended nonlinear synapse” ( ,iENS fig.2) and to synthesize an “extended neo-fuzzy neuron” (ENFN) that contains iENS elements instead of usual nonlinear synapses iNS (fig.3).\nFig.2. An extended neo-fuzzy synapse\nFig.3. An extended neo-fuzzy neuron\nIntroducing additional variables\n    0 1 2 2 ... ,p pli i li i li li i li i li ix x w w x w x w x      (14)\n                 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 ... ... ... ... ,\nh p p\ni i li i li li i li i li i l\np p i i i i i i i i i i i p p p p i i i i i i i hi i hi i\nf x x w w x w x w x\nw x w x x w x x\nw x w x x w x x\n\n  \n  \n\n     \n    \n    \n (15)\n 0 1 01 1 1 2 2, ,..., , ,..., ,..., , Tp p p i i i i i i hiw w w w w w w (16)\n              1 1 1\n2 2\n, ,..., ,\n,..., ,..., ,\np i i i i i i i i i i\nTp p i i i i i i hi i\nx x x x x x\nx x x x x\n   \n  \n (17)\nit can be written\n    ,Ti i i i if x w x  (18)\n      1 1\nˆ n n\nT T i i i i i i y f x w x w x           (19)\nwhere  1 ,..., ,..., TT T T Ti nw w w w ,         1 1 ,..., ,..., TT T Ti i n nx x x x       . It’s easy to see that the ENFN contains  1p hn adjusted synaptic weights and the fuzzy inference implemented\nby each iENS has the form\n0 1 ... , 1, 2,..., i li\np p li li i li i\nIF x IS X THEN THE OUTPUT IS w w x w x l h   \n(20)\nwhich coincides with the p-order Takagi-Sugeno inference. The ENFN has a much simpler architecture than a traditional neuro-fuzzy system that simplifies its numerical implementation. When the vector signal  x k is fed to the ENFN input, a scalar value is calculated at the ENFN output\n      ˆ 1Ty k w k x k   (21) wherein this expression differs from the expression (10) by the fact that it contains  1p  times more adjusted parameters than the conventional NFN. It is clear that the algorithm (13) may be used for training ENFN parameters obtaining the form in this case\n                  1 2 1 , 1 ,0 1. w k w k r k e k x k r k r k x k         \n    \n   \n   (22)\nIV. EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS\nTo demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive neuro-fuzzy system and its learning procedure (22), we have implemented a simulation test based on forecasting of a chaotic process defined by the Mackey-Glass equation [23]\n      10 0.2 0.1 . 1 t t y t y t y t         (23)\nThe signal defined by (22) was quantized with a step 0.1. We took a fragment containing 12000 points. The goal was to predict a time-series value on the next step 1k  using its values on steps 3k  , 2k  , 1k  , and k .\nFirst 7000 points were used as a training set (for adjusting weight coefficients of the architecture), next 5000 points were used as a test set (7001-12000) without adjusting weight coefficients. p is a fuzzy inference order, a number of membership functions h is 3, a smoothing parameter  is 0.9 during the weight adaptation procedure in (21).\nWe implement one step prediction in all our experiments. Symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean square error (MSE), used for result evaluation, are shown in Tab.1-5. Fig.4-8 present time series outputs, prediction values and prediction errors (a time series value is marked with a blue color, a prediction value is marked with a green color, a prediction error is marked with a red color). The proposed algorithm gives the close approximation and the high prediction quality of sufficiently nonstationary processes in an online mode.\n        3sin / 250 500,\n0.8sin / 250 0.2sin / 25 .\nk if k\nf k k k otherwise\n\n \n  \n   \nRMSEtest MSEtest SMAPEtest p=0 0.0080359 0.0214440 25.1994989 p=1 0.0114304 0.0194163 25.3300074\np=2 0.0017572 0.0104677 20.2466940 p=3 0.0010388 0.0106037 20.2904977 p=5 8.6533285 0.0109404 20.4180131\nFig.8.

CONCLUSION\nThe architecture of an extended neo-fuzzy neuron is proposed in the paper which is a generalization of the standard neo-fuzzy neuron in a case of the “above zero”-order fuzzy inference. The learning algorithm is proposed that is characterized by both tracking and filtering properties. The extended NFN has improved approximating properties, it’s characterized by a high learning rate, it also has simple numerical implementation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe authors would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their careful reading of this paper and for their helpful comments.\nREFERENCES\n[1] D.
