      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Video analysis and understanding represents a major challenge for computer vision and machine learning research. While previous work has traditionally relied on hand-crafted and task-specific representations (Wang et al., 2011; Sadanand & Corso, 2012), there is a growing interest in designing general video representations that could help solve tasks in video understanding such as human action recognition, video retrieval or video captionning (Tran et al., 2014).\nTwo-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have exhibited state-of-art performance in still image tasks such as classification or detection (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014b). However, such models discard temporal information that has been shown to provide important cues in videos (Wang et al., 2011). On the other hand, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have demonstrated the ability to understand temporal sequences in various learning tasks such as speech recognition (Graves & Jaitly, 2014) or machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Consequently, Recurrent Convolution Networks (RCN) (Srivastava et al., 2015; Donahue et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2015) that leverage both recurrence and convolution have recently been introduced for learning video representation. Such approaches typically extract “visual percepts” by applying a 2D CNN on the video frames and then feed the CNN activations to the proceeding RNN in order to characterize the video temporal variation.\nPrevious works on RCNs tend to focus on high-level visual percepts extracted from the 2D CNN top-layers. CNNs, however, hierachically build-up spatial invariance through pooling layers (LeCun et al., 1998; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014b) as Figure 2 highlights. While CNN tends to discard local information in its top layers, frame-to-frame temporal variation is known to be smooth, motion of video patches are restricted to a local neighborhood (Brox & Malik, 2011). For this reason, we argue that current RCN architectures are not well suited for capturing fine motion information. Instead, they are more likely focus on global appearance changes such as shot transitions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel RCN architecture that applies an RNN not solely on the 2D CNN top-layer but also on the intermediate convolutional layers. Convolutional layer activations, or convolutional\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 43\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n9 N\nov 2\n01 5\nmaps, preserve a finer spatial resolution of the input video from which local spatio-temporal patterns are extracted.\nApplying an RNN directly on intermediate convolutional maps, however, inevitably results in a drastic number of parameters characterizing the input-to-hidden transformation due to the convolutional maps size. On the other hand, convolutional maps preserve the frame spatial topology. We propose to leverage this topology by introducing sparsity and locality in the RNN units to reduce the memory requirement. We extend the GRU-RNN model (Cho et al., 2014) and replace the fully-connected RNN linear product operation with a convolution. Our GRU-extension therefore encodes the locality and temporal smoothness prior of videos directly in the model structure.\nWe evaluate our solution on UCF101 human action recognition from Soomro et al. (2012) as well as YouTube2text video captioning dataset from Chen & Dolan (2011). Experiments show that leveraging “percepts” at mutiple resolutions to model temporal variation improve over baseline model with respective gain of 3.4% and 10% for the action recognition and video captions tasks."

      "heading" : "2 GRU: GATED RECURRENT UNITS",
      "text" : "In this section, we review Gated-Recurrent-Unit (GRU) network which is a particular type of RNN. An RNN model is applied to a sequence of inputs, which can have variable lenghts. It defines a recurrent hidden state whose activation at each time is dependent on that of the previous time. Specificaly, given a sequence X = (x1,x2, ...,xT ), the RNN hidden state at time t is defined as ht = φ(ht−1,xt), where φ is a nonlinear activation function. RNNs are known to be difficult to train due to the exploding or vanishing gradient effect (Bengio et al., 1994). However, variants of RNNs such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) have empirically demonstrated their ability to model long-term temporal dependency in various task such as machine translation or image/video caption generation. In this paper, we will mainly focus on the GRU as they have shown similar performance than LSTM but with a lower memory requirement (Chung et al., 2014).\nGRU makes each recurrent unit to adaptively capture dependencies of different time scales. The activation ht of the GRU is defined by the following equations:\nzt = σ(Wzxt +Uzht−1), (1) rt = σ(Wrxt +Urht−1), (2)\nh̃t = tanh(Wxt +U(rt ht−1), (3) ht = (1− zt)ht−1 + zth̃t, (4)\nwhere is an element-wise multiplication. zt is an update gate that decides the degree to which the unit updates its activation, or content. rt is a reset gate. σ is the sigmoid function. When one unit rit is close to 0, the reset gate forgets the previously computed state, and makes the unit act as if it is reading the first symbol of an input sequence. h̃t is a candidate activation which is computed similarly to that of the traditional recurrent unit in an RNN."

      "text" : "This section delves into the main contributions of this work. We aim at leveraging visual percepts from different convolutional levels in order to capture temporal patterns that occur at different spatial resolution.\nLet’s consider (x1t , ...,x L−1 t ,x L t )(t=1..T ), a set of 2D convolutional maps extracted from L layers at different time steps in a video. We propose two alternative RCN architectures, GRU-RCN, and Stacked-GRU-RCN (illustrated in Figure 2) that combines information extracted from those convolutional maps."

      "text" : "In the first RCN architecture, we propose to apply L RNNs independently on each convolutional map. We define L RNNs as φ1, ..., φL, such that hlt = φ l(xlt,h l t−1). The hidden representation of the final time step h1T , ...,h L T are then fed to classifier in the case of action recognition, or to a text-decoder RNN for the caption generation.\nTo implement the RNN recurrent function φl, we propose to leverage Gated Recurrent Unit (Cho et al., 2014). GRUs have been originaly introduced for machine translation. It models input to hidden-state and hidden to hidden transitions using fully connected units. However, convolutional map inputs are 3D tensors (spatial dimension and input channels). Applying a GRU directly can lead to a drastic number of parameters. Let N1, N2 and Ox be the input convolutional map spatial size and number of channels. Applying a GRU directly would require input-to-hidden parameters Wl, Wlz and W l r to be of size N1 × N2 × Ox × Oh where Oh is the dimensionality of the GRU hidden representation.\nFully-connected GRUs do not take advantage of the underlying structure of convolutional maps. Indeed, convolutional maps are extracted from images that are composed of patterns with strong local correlation which are repeated over different spatial locations. In addition, videos have smooth temporal variation over time, i.e. motion associated with a given patch in successive frames will be restricted in a local spatial neighborhood. We embed such a prior in our model structure and replace the fully-connected units in GRU with convolution operations. We therefore obtain reccurent units that have sparse connectivity and share their parameters across different input spatial locations:\nzlt = σ(W l z ∗ xlt +Ulz ∗ hlt−1), (5)\nrlt = σ(W l r ∗ xlt +Ulr ∗ hlt−1), (6)\nh̃lt = tanh(W l ∗ xlt +U ∗ (rlt hlt−1), (7)\nhlt = (1− zlt)hlt−1 + zlth̃lt, (8)\nwhere ∗ denotes a convolution operation. In this formulation, Model parameters W,Wlz,Wlr and Ul,Ulz,U l r are 2D-convolutional kernels. Our model results hidden recurrent representation that preserves the spatial topology, hlt = (h l t(i, j)) where h l t(i, j)) is a feature vector defined at the location (i, j). To ensure that the spatial size of the hidden representation remains fixed over time, we use zero-padding in the recurrent convolutions.\nUsing convolution, parameters Wl, Wlz and W l r have a size of k1×k2×Ox×Oh where k1×k2 is the convolutional kernel spatial size (usually 3×3), choosen to be significantly lower than convolutional map size N1×N2. The candidate hidden representation h̃t(i, j), the activation gate zk(i, j) and the reset gate rk(i, j) are defined based on a local neigborhood of size (k1 × k2) at the location(i, j) in both the input data xt and the previous hidden-state ht−1. In addition, the size of receptive field associated with hl(i, j)t increases in the previous presentation hlt−1,h l t−2... as we go back further in time. Our model is therefore capable of characterizing spatio-temporal pattern with high spatial variation in time."

While GRU-RCN applies each layer-wise GRU-RNN in an independent fashion, Stacked GRU-RCN preconditions each GRU-RNN on the output of the previous GRU-RNN at the current time step: hlt = φ l(hlt−1,h l−1 t ,x l t). The previous RNN hidden representation is given as an extrainput to the GRU convolutional units:\nzll = σ(W l z ∗ xlt +Wlzl ∗ h l−1 t +U l z ∗ hlt−1), (9)\nrlt = σ(W l r ∗ xlt +Wlrl ∗ h l−1 t +U l rh l t−1), (10)\nh̃lt = tanh(W l ∗ xlt +Ul ∗ (rt hlt−1), (11)\nhlt = (1− zlt)hlt−1 + zlth̃lt, (12) Adding this extra-connection brings more flexibility and gives the opportunity for the model to leverage representations with different resolutions."

      "heading" : "4 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Deep learning approaches have recently been used to learn video representation and produced stateof-art results (Karpathy et al., 2014; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014a; Wang et al., 2015b; Tran et al., 2014). Karpathy et al. (2014); Tran et al. (2014) proposed to use 3D CNN learn a video representations, leveraging large training datasets such as Sport 1 Million. However, unlike image classification (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014b), CNNs did not yield large improvement over these traditional methods (Lan et al., 2014) highlighting the difficulty of learning video representation even with large training dataset. Simonyan & Zisserman (2014a) introduced a two-stream framework where they train CNNs independently on RGB and optical flow inputs. While the flow stream focuses only on motion information, the RGB can leverage 2D CNN pre-trained on image datasets. Based on the Two Stream representation, Wang et al. (2015a) extracted deep feature and conducted trajectory constrained pooling to aggregate convolutional feature as video representations.\nRNN models have also been used to encode temporal information for learning video representations in conjonction with 2D CNNs. Ng et al. (2015); Donahue et al. (2014) applied an RNN on top of the the two-stream framework, while Srivastava et al. (2015) proposed, in addition, to investigate the benefit of learning a video representation in an unsupervised manner. Previous works on this topic tend to focus only on high-level CNN “visual percepts”. By contrast, our approach proposes to leverage visual “percepts” extracted from different layers in the 2D-CNN.\nRecently, Shi et al. (2015) also proposed to leverage convolutional units inside an RNN network. However, they focus on different task (now-casting) and RNN model (LSTM). In addition, they applied their model directly on pixels. Here, we use recurrent convolutional units on pre-trained CNN convolutional maps, to extract temporal pattern from visual “percepts” with different spatial sizes."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we only consider on the video RGB inputs. One could further improve the classification performance by considering other inputs such as the video optical flow Simonyan & Zisserman (2014a); Wang et al. (2015b). However, the main purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the benefit of visual clues from multiple CNN layers when modeling the temporal information in a videos.\nWe design and evaluate three RCN architectures for action recognition. We use a VGG-16 CNN pretrained on ImageNet (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014b) that is fine-tuned on the UCF-101 dataset, following the protocol in Wang et al. (2015b). We then extract the convolution maps from pool2, pool3, pool4, pool5 layers and the fully-connected map from layer fc-7 (which can be view as a feature map with a 1 × 1 spatial dimension). Those features maps are given as inputs to our RCN models.\nIn the first RCN architecture, GRU-RCN, we apply 5 convolutional GRU-RNNs independently on each convolutional map. Each convolution in the GRU-RCN has zero-padded 3×3 convolution that preserves the spatial dimension of the inputs . The number of channels of each respective GRU-RNN hidden-representations are 64, 128, 256, 256, 512. After the RCN operation we obtain 5 hiddenrepresentations for each time step. We apply average pooling on the hidden-representations of the last time-step to reduce their spatial dimension to 1×1 , and feed the representations to 5 classifiers, composed by a linear layer with a softmax nonlineary. Each classifier therefore focuses on only 1 hidden-representations extracted from the convolutional map of a specific layer. The classifier outputs are then averaged to get the final decision. A dropout ratio of 0.7 is applied on the input of each classifiers.\nIn the second RCN architecture, Stacked GRU-RCN, we investigate the usefulness of bottom-up connections. Stacked GRU-RCN uses the same base architecture as GRU-RCN, 5 convolutional GRU-RNN having 64, 128, 256, 256 channels respectively. However, each convolutional GRURNNs is now preconditioned on the hidden-represention that the GRU-RNN applied on the previous convolution-maps outputs. We apply max-pooling on the hidden representations between the GRU-\nRNN layers for the compatibility of the spatial dimensions. As for the previous architecture, each GRU-RNN hidden-representation at the last time step is pooled and then given as input to a classifer.\nFinally, in Bi-directional GRU-RCN, we investigate the importance of reverse temporal information. Given convolutional maps extracted from one layer, we run the GRU-RCN twice, considering the inputs in both sequential and reverse temporal order. We then concatenate the last hiddenrepresentations of the foward GRU-RCN and backward GRU-RCN, and give the resulting vector to a classifier."

      "heading" : "5.1.2 MODEL TRAINING AND EVALUATION",
      "text" : "We follow the training procedure introduced by the two-stream framework Simonyan & Zisserman (2014a). At each iteration, a batch of 64 videos are sampled randomly from the the training set. To perform scale-augmentation, we randomly sample the cropping width and height from 256, 224, 192, 168. The temporal cropping size is set to 10. We then resize the cropped volume to 224× 224× 10. We estimate each model parameters by maximizing the model log-likelihood:\nL(θ) = 1 N N∑ n=1 log p(yn | c(xn),θ),\nwhere there are N training video-action pairs (xn, yn), c is a function that takes a crop at random. We use Adam Kingma & Ba (2014) with the gradient computed by the backpropagation algorithm. We perform early stopping and choose the parameters that maximize the log-probability of the validation set.\nWe also follow the evaluation protocol of the two-stream framework Simonyan & Zisserman (2014a). At the test time, we sample 25 equally spaced video sub-volumes with a temporal size of 10 frames. From each of these selected sub-volumes, we obtain 10 inputs for our model, i.e. 4 corners, 1 center, and their horizontal flipping. The final pre- diction score is obtained by averaging across the sampled sub-volumes and their cropped regions.\n5.1.3 RESULTS\nWe compare our approach with two different baselines, VGG-16 and VGG-16 RNN. VGG-16 is the 2D spatial stream that is described in Wang et al. (2015b). We take the VGG-16 model, pretrained on Image-Net and fine-tune it on the UCF-101 dataset. VGG-16 RNN baseline applied an RNN, using fully-connected gated-recurrent units, on top-of VGG-16. It takes as input the VGG-16 fully-connected representation fc-7. Following GRU-RCN top-layer, the VGG-16 RNN has hiddenrepresentation of dimensionality 512.\nIn Table 1, we first report results of different GRU-RCN variants and compare them with the two baselines: VGG-16 and VGG-16 RNN. Our GRU-RCN variants all outperform the baselines, show-\ning the benefit of delving deeper into a CNN in order to learn a video representation. We notice that VGG-16 RNN only slightly improve over the VGG-16 baseline, 78.1 against 78.0. This result confirms that CNN top-layer tends to discard temporal variation over short temporal windows. Stacked-GRU RCN performs significantly lower than GRU-RCN and Bi-directional GRU-RCN. We argue that bottom-up connection, increasing the depth of the model, combined with the lack of training data (UCF-101 is train set composed by only 9500 videos) make the Stacked-GRU RCN learning difficult. Bi-directional GRU-RCN perform the best among the GRU-RCN variant with an accuracy of 80.7, showing the advantage of modeling temporal information in both sequential and reverse orer. Bi-directional GRU-RCN obtains a gain 3.4% in term of performances, relatively to the baselines that focus only the VGG-16 top layer.\nTable 1 also reports results from other state-of-art approaches using RGB inputs. C3D Tran et al. (2014) obtains the best performance on UCF-101 with 85.2. However, it should be noted that C3D is trained over 1 million videos. Other approaches use only the 9500 videos of UCF101 training set for learning temporal pattern. Our Bi-directional GRU-RCN compare favorably with other Recurrent Convolution Network (second blocks), confirming the benefit of using different CNN layers to model temporal variation."

Both models have been fine-tuned on the UCF-101 dataset and therefore focus on detecting actions. To extract an abstract representation from a video, we sample K equally-space segments. When using the VGG16 encoder, we provide the fc7 layer activations of the each segment’s first frame as the input to the text-decoder.

We identify and underscore the importance of modeling temporal variation from “visual percepts” at different spatial resolutions.

Low-level percepts, on the other hand, preserve a higher spatial resolution from which we can model finer motion patterns. We introduce a novel recurrent convolutional network architecture that leverages convolutional maps, from all levels of a deep convolutional network trained on the ImageNet dataset, to take advantage of “percepts” from different spatial resolutions.\nWe have empirically validated our approach on the Human Action Recognition and Video Captioning tasks using the UCF-101 and YouTube2Text datasets.

Karpathy et al. (2014); Tran et al. (2014) proposed to use 3D CNN learn a video representations, leveraging large training datasets such as Sport 1 Million. However, unlike image classification (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014b), CNNs did not yield large improvement over these traditional methods (Lan et al., 2014) highlighting the difficulty of learning video representation even with large training dataset. Simonyan & Zisserman (2014a) introduced a two-stream framework where they train CNNs independently on RGB and optical flow inputs. While the flow stream focuses only on motion information, the RGB can leverage 2D CNN pre-trained on image datasets. Based on the Two Stream representation, Wang et al. (2015a) extracted deep feature and conducted trajectory constrained pooling to aggregate convolutional feature as video representations.",

Our method relies on percepts that are extracted from all levels of a deep convolutional network trained on the large ImageNet dataset. While high-level percepts contain highly discriminative information, they tend to have a low-spatial resolution. Low-level percepts, on the other hand, preserve a higher spatial resolution from which we can model finer motion patterns. Using low-level percepts, however, can lead to high-dimensionality video representations. To mitigate this effect and control the number of parameters, we introduce a variant of the GRU model that leverages the convolution operations to enforce sparse connectivity of the model units and share parameters across the input spatial locations. We empirically validate our approach on both Human Action Recognition and Video Captioning tasks. In particular, we achieve results equivalent to state-of-art on the YouTube2Text dataset using a simpler caption-decoder model and without extra 3D CNN features.",
