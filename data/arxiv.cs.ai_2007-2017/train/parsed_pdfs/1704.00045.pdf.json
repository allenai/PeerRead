A er discovering the alignment by methods, several performance scores are available to evaluate them. e scores require the produced alignment by amethod and the reference alignment containing the underlying actual correspondences of the given ontologies.\ne current trend in alignment evaluation is to put forward a new score and to compare various alignments by juxtaposing their performance scores. However, it is substantially provocative to select one performance score among others for comparison. On top of that, claiming if one method has a be er performance than one another can not be substantiated by solely comparing the scores. In this paper, we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically favor one method over one another. e McNemar test is considered as a reliable and suitable means for comparing two ontology alignment methods over one matching task. e test applies to a 2 × 2 contingency table which can be constructed in two di erent ways based on the alignments, each of which has their own merits/pitfalls. e ways of the contingency table construction and various apposite statistics from the McNemar test are elaborated in minute detail. In the case of having more than two alignment methods for comparison, the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. us, the ways of preventing such an error are also discussed. A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the McNemar test in the presence of multiple alignment methods. From this graph, it is readily understood if one method is be er than one another or if their di erences are imperceptible. Our investigation on the methods participated in the anatomy track of OAEI 2016 demonstrates that AML and CroMatcher are the top two methods and DKP-AOM and Alin are the bo om two ones. Moreover, the Levenstein and N-gram string-based distances discover the most correspondences while SMOA and Hamming distance are the ones with the least found correspondences.\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: ontology alignment; McNemar test; family-wise error rate; anatomy;\nACM Reference format: Majid Mohammadi, Amir Ahooye Atashin, Wout Hofman, and Yaohua Tan. 2017.

      "text" : "With the boom in information technology, data these days come from various sources. Such data have multiple salient but unwelcome features: they are big, dynamic and heterogeneous. ere are solutions to cope with any of these features, and ontology alignment (or mapping/matching) is the remedy to data heterogeneity (Euzenat et al. 2007). Given the source and target ontologies for alignment, a correspondence is de ned as the mapping of one concept\nACM acknowledges that this contribution was authored or co-authored by an employee, or contractor of the national government.

Publication date: 2017.\nin the source to one concept in the target ontology. For discovering correspondences, it is typical to utilize a similarity measure. ere are three di erent similarity measure categories. e rst category is the string-based measure which only considers the text of concepts to declare their similarities (Cohen et al. 2003; Levenshtein 1966; Stoilos et al. 2005). Another category is the linguistic-based similarity measures which consider the linguistic relations, e.g. synonym, antonym, hypernym, etc., between the strings of two concepts. e linguistic-based similarity measures usually take advantages of WordNet (Miller 1995) to discover the similarity. e third category is the structural-based measures which take into account the position of the concepts in their ontologies. Traditionally, the challenge of ontology alignment was to come up with a new similarity measure and then to\nnd the interrelation between the ontologies (Stoilos et al. 2005). However, this focus has moved to take advantages of various similarity measures and try to reason the correspondences based on outcomes of di erent similarity measures (Jan et al. 2012; Nagy et al. 2006). An alignment, which is the result of any standard ontology matching algorithm, comprises a set of correspondences, mapping various concepts of one ontology to one another. It is the common practice to nd the goodness of an alignment method by comparing its output with the actual alignment which is in hand. However, it is controversial to select the appropriate performance score in di erent cases. On top of that, claiming the superiority of method against one another cannot be substantiated by merely comparing the obtained scores. In this article, the appropriate procedures are put forward to statistically opt for one method if it has actually be er performance than the other. However, the claim of superior performance must be treated with caution as the no free lunch theorem suggests. According to the no free lunch theorem (Wolpert 2012;Wolpert and Macready 1997), there is no context-independent reason to favor one strategy (or optimization method) over one another. e average performances of all strategies over all possible problems are the same. It is drawn, as a result, that the superior performance of one method over one another is due to its be er tness to the nature of the problem, not because of its inherent features. Any claim of performing the best in a general sense must be questioned and faced with doubts.\ne no free lunch theorem is rstly introduced in the supervised machine learning realm (Wolpert 1996), but it is generalized to any optimization problem a erward (Wolpert and Macready 1997). erefore, the results of the no free lunch theorem are also correct for the ontology alignment algorithms, and the preferred alignment method can be only discovered in one particular context. To date, the a empt of claiming if one method is be er than one another has been solely concentrated on employing a new performance score (e.g. precision, recall, etc.) (Ehrig and Sure 2004; Euzenat 2007; Ritze et al. 2013). If there are multiple pairs of ontologies for comparison, the superiority of a method is concluded only if its average performance across multiple pairs of ontologies is higher than the rest. Statistically speaking, the average performance is unsafe and inappropriate: it is highly sensitive to the outliers and having higher average performance does not necessarily indicate the superiority (the di erence might be imperceptible and insigni - cant) (Demšar 2006). In the case of existing only one pair of ontologies, on the other hand, the comparison is merely performed by the juxtaposition of the performance scores of the methods. As a complement to the no free lunch theorem, this article aims to consider the statistical hypothesis testing to nd the best ontology alignment on a particular task. Employing the appropriate statistical test, one can determine if one alignment method outperforms one another with substantial statistical evidence. Instead of comparing one alignment with the reference one, the methodology proposed here takes the reference alignment along with two alignments under comparison as the inputs and states if one alignment statistically outperforms the other. us, the outcome of the methodology in this article is not a score but the statement of superiority of an alignment in comparison with one another.\ne McNemar test is the statistical means by which the various methods of alignment over one matching task can be compared. is test can be applied to the paired nominal data summarized in a contingency table with a dichotomous trait. Summing up the results of alignments in a contingency table would be challenging andmight\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0.

Further, four statistics from the McNemar family are considered, and their advantages and pitfalls are discussed. In the case of having two methods for comparison, the McNemar test can be simply applied. If more than two alignments are available, all pairwise comparisons must be performed. In this case, the family-wise error rate (FWER) is likely to happen and must be controlled. e appropriate procedures for the FWER prevention are elaborated as well. We leverage the proposed methodology across the anatomy track 2016, and the corresponding results are visualized by a directed graph. is graph indicates if the di erence between each pair of methods are signi cant or not. AML and Cromatcher have shown the best performances, and DKP-AOM and Alin are the ones with reduced accomplishment. We further compare the string-based similarity measures over this track because many correspondences can be easily discovered by comparing the strings. e N-gram and Levenstein distances are the ones with the maximum discovery with respect to others.\nis paper is organized as follows. e ways of the contingency table construction are brought in Section II, and the appropriate statistics from the McNemar test are discussed in Section III. e family wise error rate and the ways of adjusting the p-values are studied in Section IV. Section V dedicates to the experiments of the statistical procedures over the anatomy track, and the paper is concluded in Section VI."

      "heading" : "2 CONTINGENCY TABLE CONSTRUCTION",
      "text" : "e McNemar test is applicable when there are two experiments over N samples (McNemar 1947). Let the\noutcome of each test be either positive or negative; then a simple contingency table would be as Table 1.\nIn this table, n00 and n11 are called the accordant pair and are respectively the number of experiments when both experiments produce positive and negative outcomes. e discordant pair, i.e. n01 and n10, are the number of experiments when the results of experiments are in contradiction; n01 is the number of experiments which the rst outcome is negative while the second one is positive and n10 is the other way around. In ontology matching case, the positive or negative outcome for experiments can be de ned in two ways, each of which has its own merits and is suitable for particular situations. For given two ontologies, let R be the reference alignment containing a set of correct correspondences and A1 and A2 be two alignments retrieved by two di erent methods. In the rst approach of the contingency table construction, the focus is on the truly discovered alignments, thereby ignoring the concepts which have not correctly mapped. Hence, n00 andn11 are respectively the number of correspondences in the reference alignment R which are not in both alignments A1 and A2 and the number of correspondences which are in the reference and both alignments. n01 (and similarly n10) is the number of correspondences truly discovered by A2, but not by A1. ese elements can be wri en as\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\n  n00 = |R − (A1 ∪A2)| n01 = |(A2 ∩ R) −A1 | n10 = |(A1 ∩ R) −A2 | n11 = |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ R |\n(1)\nwhere |.| indicates the cardinality operator. is approach is conceptually similar to recall as it does not consider the number of correspondences which are falsely discovered by methods. We again accent that the approach of this article is di erent than the performance scores, including recall, as we compare two alignments and do not produce any score indicating the neness of the alignments. An example elaborates the issue of this approach. Assume that both methods can discover the complete reference alignment, i.e. A1 = A2 = R. In this case, n01 = n10 = 0 which means that the both methods have performed equally well (it is discussed in further sections that n01 and n10 are the only important pair for the McNemar test). Now, suppose that A1 = R and A2 = R + B, where B is a set of correspondences which are not in R (falsely discovered by A2). In this case, n01 is the same as n10 which again indicates that the two methods perform equally well. However, it is plain to grasp that A1 is a more reliable method as it does not mistakenly discover any correspondences. Statistically speaking, this approach does not take into account the false positive and only considers the true positive. Nonetheless, such an approach is suitable for occasions where the goal is to have as many correspondences as possible so that the false discovery does not have a profound impact.\ne second approach of building the contingency table avoids the aforementioned pitfall and consider the false discovery as well. As it considers the truly unmapped pairs of concepts, obtaining the elements of the contingency table is of higher complexity in comparison with the previous approach. erefore, it is necessary to explain how to obtain each element of the table individually. n00 is the number of correspondences which are wrongly discovered by both alignments. Hence it includes the correspondences which are in R but not in A1 or A2 plus the correspondences which are in both A1 and A2 but not in R, i.e. n00 = |R − (A1 ∪ A2)| + |(A1 ∩ A2) − R |. n10 is the number of truly discovered correspondences by A1 which are not in A2 plus the correspondences which are falsely identi ed only by A2 and not by A1, i.e. n10 = |(A1∩R) −A2 | + |A2 −A1 −R |. With the same token, n01 can also be obtained. n11 is a bit more challenging as the total number of possible correspondences between two ontologies is required. Let this number beT , one possibility for T is to multiply the number of concepts of two ontologies, i.e. T = n ×m where n andm are the numbers of candidate concepts for matching in two ontologies. us, n11 = |A1∩A2∩R |+ |T −(A1∪A2−R)|. e statistics considered in this paper only need the discordant pair; therefore the value of n11 and subsequently T is not taken into account. e elements as mentioned earlier of the contingency table from the second approach can be summarized as:\n  n00 = |R − (A1 ∪ A2)| + |(A1 ∩ A2) − R | n01 = |(A2 ∩ R) −A1 | + |A1 −A2 − R | n10 = |(A1 ∩ R) −A2 | + |A2 −A1 − R | n11 = |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ R | + |T − (A1 ∪ A2 − R)|\n(2)\nis way of the contingency table construction considers the falsely discovered correspondences of methods.\nNote that this calculation is relative to the other method. In other words, it does not consider all the incorrectly identi ed correspondences, but the false correspondences are considered which are not in the rival method. As the goal is to compare two alignments together, it is entirely rational to nd the relative false positive. is approach can be guratively viewed as similar to F-measure due to its consideration of both true and false discoveries.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0.

      "text" : "Having built the contingency table, it is time to run the McNemar test. Before elaborating the McNemar test, we digress a li le to explain the null hypothesis testing. To leverage any statistical test, the null and alternative hypotheses are required. e null hypothesis H0 states that the di erence between two populations is insigni cant, and this di erence is due to the sampling or experimental errors (Sheskin 2003). e alternative hypothesis, on the other hand, states the contrary: the di erence between two populations is signi cant and not random. To reject or retain H0, we need to compute the p-value and compare it with signi cant level α which must be determined before running the test. e p-value is the probability of obtaining a result equal to, or even more extreme than the observations (Sheskin 2003). If the p-value is less than the nominal signi cant level α , then the null hypothesis is rejected, and it is drawn that the di erence between populations is signi cant. In the comparison of ontology alignment methods, the populations mentioned above are the outcomes of two methods. erefore, the null hypothesis is that the di erence between the outcomes of alignment methods is random and insigni cant. e null hypothesis in the McNemar test states that the two marginal probabilities of the contingency table are the same, i.e.\np(n00) + p(n01) = p(n00) + p(n10)\np(n10) + p(n11) = p(n01) + p(n11) (3)\nwhere p(a) indicates the probability of occurring the cell of Table 1 with the label a. A er canceling out the p(n00) and p(n11) from the aforementioned equations, the null and alternative hypotheses are obtained as\nH0 : p(n01) = p(n10)\nHa : p(n01) , p(n10). (4)\nTo obtain the p-value of the null hypothesis (4), we consider four statistics from the McNemar family and discuss their advantages and pitfalls in the hypothesis testing. e statistics studied here only work with the accordant pair of the contingency table. However, there is also an exact unconditional McNemar test which takes into account the discordant pair of the contingency table (Suissa and Shuster 1991). e exact unconditional test is way more intricate than the McNemar tests put forward here, but its power is approximately the same as other tests (Fagerland et al. 2013). erefore, this test is ignored in this paper."

      "text" : "When there are two methods for comparison, the null hypothesis will be rejected if the obtained p-value is below the nominal signi cant level α . If more than two alignment algorithms are available for comparison, the well-known family-wise error rate (FWER) might happen. FWER refers to the increase in the probability of type I error which is likely to violate the nominal signi cant level α when multiple populations are to be compared. To explain what FWER is, assume that there are 5 methods for comparison and the signi cant level is α = 0.05. If it is desired to do all the pairwise comparisons, then there are k = 5 × 4/2 = 10 hypotheses overall. For each of the null hypothesis, the probability of rejection without occurring the type I error is 1−α = 0.95. For all comparisons, on the other hand, the probability of not having any type I error in all the hypotheses is (0.95)10 = 0.6. As a result, the probability of occurring type I error increases to 1 − 0.6 = 0.4, which is way higher than the nominal α = 0.05. is phenomenon is the so-called family-wise error rate. To prevent this error, there are two primary approaches. Akin to the above example, the rst approach is applicable when all the pairwise comparisons are desired. Conducting all pairwise comparisons are suitable when a comparison study of the existing methods in the literature or a comparison of methods in a competition like\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0.

For the sake of simplicity, the former approach is called N × N comparisons and the la er is called N × 1 comparisons."

      "text" : "When a new alignment method is proposed, it is usually compared with other state-of-the-art alignments. For comparing n methods (including the proposed one) in this case, k = n − 1 comparisons must be performed.\nere are four methods which can control the family-wise error rate in N × 1 comparison. ese methods can be viewed as the p-value adjustment procedures which modify the p-values in a way that the adjusted p-values (APV) can be directly compared with the signi cant level while the nominal signi cant level is also preserved.\nus, a null hypothesis is rejected if its corresponding adjusted p-value be below the nominal α .\nLetHi , i = 1, ...,k be all hypotheses for nmethods andpi , i = 1, ...,k be their corresponding p-values. e Bonferroni’s method (Dunn 1961) is the most straightforward way to prevent FWER. In this procedure, all the p-values are compared with the nominal signi cant level α divided by the total number of comparisons. In other words, the hypothesis Hi is rejected if pi < α/k . Based on this equation, the adjusted p-value for the Hi hypothesis is obtained by multiplying both sides of above inequality by k , i.e. APVi = min{k × pi , 1}. us, Hi is rejected if APVi < α . is procedure, though simple, is too conservative: it retains the hypotheses which must be rejected by generating high APV. Contrary to the single step Bonferroni correction, there are step-up and step-down procedures which sequentially reject the null hypothesis. It is necessary to order p-values for sequential rejective procedures and we denote the ordered p-values as p1 ≤ p2 ≤ ... ≤ pk and their corresponding hypotheses are H1,H2, ...,Hk .\ne Holm’s procedure (Holm 1979) is a step-down method which starts with the most signi cant (or the small-\nest) p-value p1. If p1 ≤ α k , then H1 is rejected, and p2 is compared with α k−1 . If p2 ≤ α k−1 , then H2 is rejected, and p3 is compared with α\nk−2 . is procedure continues until an hypothesis is retained. In other words, each\npi in the Holm’s method is compared with α\nk+1−i and it is rejected if it is below this value, otherwise it is not\nrejected and the rest hypotheses are retained as well. e Holm adjusted p-value is APVi = min{vi , 1} where vi =max{(k − j)pj : 1 ≤ j ≤ i}. Similar to the Holm’s procedure, the Holland’s procedure (Holland and Copenhaver 1987) is also a step-down method. Instead of comparing the p-values with α k+1−i , it compares each pi with 1−(1−α) k−i . us, the adjusted p-value is APVi = min{vi , 1} where vi = max{1 − (1 − pj ) k+1−j : 1 ≤ j ≤ i}. e Finner’s procedure (Finner 1993) is almost the same as the Holland’s procedure and compares each pi with 1−(1−α) k i . e Finner adjusted p-value is APVi = min{vi , 1} where vi = max{1 − (1 − pj ) k j : 1 ≤ j ≤ i}.\ne Hochberg’s procedure (Hochberg 1988) works in the opposite direction and starts with the largest p-value. It compares the largest p-value with α , the next largest with α/2 and it is terminated until a hypothesis can be rejected. All the hypotheses with the smaller p-values are then rejected as well. e Hochberg adjusted p-value is APVi = max{(k − j)pj : (k − 1) ≥ j ≥ i}."

We select 10 methods participated in OAEI 2016 for conducting the comparison: Alin (da Silva 2016), AML (Faria et al. 2013), CroMatcher (Achichi et al. 2016a), DKP-AOM (Amrouch et al. 2016), FCA-Map (Zhao and Zhang 2016), Lily (Wang and Xu 2008), LogMapLite (Jiménez-Ruiz and Grau 2011), LPHOM (Megdiche et al. 2016), LYAM (Achichi et al. 2016b) and XMap (Djeddi and Khadir 2010).\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\ne contingency table is built by the two aforementioned methodologies. e values for n01 and n10 for the\nway of ignoring the false positive and considering it are brought in Tables 2 and 3. For the sake of simplicity, n01 and n10 are tabulated in one single table for each perspective (below and upper diagonal). To compare the ith and jth methods in each approach, (i, j) and (j, i) elements of this table is taken as n01 and n10, where (i, j) is the element at the ith row and jth column. For instance, let’s compare the Alin and AML methods. In the\nrst perspective, n01 = 911 which means that there are 911 correspondences discovered by AML but not by Alin. And, n10 = 0 indicates that there are no correspondences which are in the Alin but are not in the AML alignment. In the second perspective, on the other hands, n01 = 917 and n10 = 72. Comparing with the previous view, n10 changes from 0 to 72 which means that AML has discovered 72 wrong correspondences while Alin has not. e li le increase in n01 is due to the false discovery rate of Alin (6 correspondences) in comparison to AML. As a result, it is grasped that the false discovery rate of Alin is less than AML while the true discovery rate of AML is way higher that Alin. If the McNemar test rejects the null hypothesis, then AML is concluded to have a be er performance than Alin due to its higher true discovery rate than Alin. e comparison of other methods can be conducted likewise which clari es the di erence between the two perspectives.\nFor the comparison study, we conduct all the pairwise comparisons. We take advantage of the Nemenyi’s correction, the most conservative one, and Bergman’s correction, the most powerful one, to control the family-wise error rate. We visualize the results using weighted graphs. Four di erent weighted graphs correspond to each perspective, and each correction methods are brought in Figures (1 - 4). e nodes in these graphs are the methods under study and any directed edge A→ B means that the method A is signi cantly be er than the method B. If there is no such an edge, there is no signi cant di erence between the corresponding methods.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\nFirst, we compare the results obtained from the Nemenyi’s and Bergman’s correction from each perspective of the contingency table construction. Figures 2 and 1 are the weighted graphs corresponds to the pairwise comparisons of alignment methods obtained by applying respectively the Nemenyi’s and Bergmann’s correction under the rst perspective of contingency table construction. e results of these two correction methods are di erent in only one comparison: the Bergmann’s correction indicates the signi cant di erence between Cromatcher and LYAM while the Nemenyi’s correction method can not detect it. us, the Bergmann’s correction is more powerful than the Nemenyi’s correction as the theory suggests.\nIn the second approach which also considers the false positive, the Bergmann’s correction method indicates its power in comparison with the Nemenyi’s correction. It declares the di erence between FCA-Map LYAM and between LYAM and LogMapLite signi cant while the Nemenyi’s correction cannot detect such di erences as signi cant. Now, we compare the two perspectives on the contingency table construction. To do so, the Bergmann’s correction method is considered due to its ability to detect more di erences. Considering Fig. 2, it is readily seen that the LYAM and XMAP methods are not declared signi cant, but both of them are declared signi cant in comparison to FCA-MAP. If the false positive rate is taken into account, as in Fig. 4, FCA-MAP is replaced LYAM. To investigate such a replacement, Tables 2 and 3 must be considered. While the false positive rate is not considered, FCA-Map has 51 correct correspondences which are not in LYAM, and LYAM has 110 true correspondences which do not exist in FCA-MAP. However, when the false positive is also considered, the number of truly discovered correspondences by FCA-MAP which are not in the LYAM alignment increases to 220 while the number of truly discovered correspondences by LYAM which are not in FCA-MAP is 160. As a result, the LYAM ontology mapping is be er than FCA-MAP from the rst point of view, but FCA-MAP outperforms LYAM in the second approach because it has a lower false discovery rate in comparison with LYAM. e same\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\nargument is also valid for the comparison of FCA-MAP and XAMP: if the falsely discovered correspondences are not taken into account, XAMP outperforms FCA-MAP while they are declared insigni cant when the false discovery error is considered as well. Another di erence between two perspectives on the contingency table construction is about the LogMapLite method. When the false discovery rate does not ma er, Lily outperforms LogMapLite, which is further declared insigni cant compared with LPHOM. If the false positive error is heeded, however, LogMapLite outperforms LPHOM and it is declared insigni cant with Lily. is indicates that LogMapLite has a lower false discovery rate than Lily and LPHOM. We nally rank the methods participated in OAEI 2016 in Table 4 based on the Bergmann’s correction. e columns with labels IFP and CFP correspond to the contingency table construction with ignoring the false discovery (IFP) and considering (CFP) it. In this table, the methods in higher rows are ones which are signi cantly be er than the methods in lower rows. If two methods are not signi cantly di erent, they are placed in the same cell. It can be readily seen that AML and DKP-AOM are the best and the worst methods from two perspectives.\ne string-based similarity measures are of utmost importance in the anatomy track because many correspon-\ndences can be discovered if the right string-based similarity is employed. To compare various measures, we take advantage of Shiva framework (Mathur et al. 2014) which convert the ontology mapping into an assignment problem. In this framework, the similarity between each concept from the source ontology is gauged with all the concepts of the target ontology. e similarity score from the concepts of two ontologies construct a matrix, which can be given to the Hungarian algorithm (Munkres 1957) to nd the best match for each concept. We use nine string-based similarity measure to construct the matrix: Levenstein (Levenshtein 1966), N-gram (Kondrak 2005), Hamming (Euzenat et al. 2007), Jaro (Jaro 1995), JaroWinkler (Winkler 1999), SMOA (Stoilos et al. 2005), NeedlemanWunsch2 (Needleman and Wunsch 1970), Substring distance (Euzenat et al. 2007) and equivalence\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\nmeasure. e Hungarian method applies to the resultant matrix to nd the best correspondence for each concept.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\nWe consider the case when the false positive is not taken into account for two reason. First, the string-based alignment is generally exploited to discover a rst-line matching (Marie and Gal 2007). e result of this measure is then improved by various methodologies to discover the so-called second-line matching. us, the goal of the\nrst-line matcher would be to nd as much true correspondences as possible. Second, we have not used any threshold to invalidate some correspondences. e Hungarian method surely assigns a concept from the source\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 0, No. 0, Article 0. Publication date: 2017.\nontology to one in the target ontology. erefore, there are many correspondences with low con dence which might invalidate even if a small threshold is applied. For these two reasons, we report the outcomes of the stringbased similarity measure with the neglect of the false positive. Similar to the previous ones, Table 5 tabulates n01 and n10 corresponding to di erent string-based similarity measures while the false positive is ignored. e results are visualized by a directed graph shown in Fig. 5. From this gure, N-gram has shown the best performances and is followed by Levenstein. Further, SMOA and Hamming distances are the ones with the least retrieved correspondences but they are be er than Substring and Equivalence measures as expected."

Further, e ways for preventing family-wise error rate, which is likely to happen in the comparison of multiple (> 2) alignment methods, are explored in minute detail. e proposed methodologies are applied to the anatomy track of ontology alignment initiative evaluation (OAEI) 2016. It is indicated that the AML and CroMatcher are the top two algorithms, and Alin and DKP-AOM are the worst alignment methods. For string-based measures, N-gram and Levenstein outperform other methods while SMOA and Hamming distance have shown poor performances."

    "abstractText" : "Ontology alignment is widely used to nd the correspondences between dierent ontologies in diverse elds. Aer discovering the alignment by methods, several performance scores are available to evaluate them. e scores require the produced alignment by amethod and the reference alignment containing the underlying actual correspondences of the given ontologies. e current trend in alignment evaluation is to put forward a new score and to compare various alignments by juxtaposing their performance scores. However, it is substantially provocative to select one performance score among others for comparison. On top of that, claiming if one method has a beer performance than one another can not be substantiated by solely comparing the scores. In this paper, we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically favor one method over one another. e McNemar test is considered as a reliable and suitable means for comparing two ontology alignment methods over one matching task. e test applies to a 2 × 2 contingency table which can be constructed in two dierent ways based on the alignments, each of which has their own merits/pitfalls. e ways of the contingency table construction and various apposite statistics from the McNemar test are elaborated in minute detail. In the case of having more than two alignment methods for comparison, the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. us, the ways of preventing such an error are also discussed. A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the McNemar test in the presence of multiple alignment methods. From this graph, it is readily understood if one method is beer than one another or if their dierences are imperceptible. Our investigation on the methods participated in the anatomy track of OAEI 2016 demonstrates that AML and CroMatcher are the top two methods and DKP-AOM and Alin are the boom two ones. Moreover, the Levenstein and N-gram string-based distances discover the most correspondences while SMOA and Hamming distance are the ones with the least found correspondences.",
