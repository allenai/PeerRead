      "text" : "Paraphrasing, the act of using textual alternatives to express the same meaning as the source content, is an important subtask in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications such as question answering, information extraction, information retrieval, summarization and natural language generation. Research on paraphrasing methods typically aims at solving three related problems: (1) recognition (i.e. to identify if two textual units are paraphrases of each other), (2) extraction (i.e. to extract paraphrase instances from a thesaurus or a corpus), and (3) generation (i.e. to generate a reference paraphrase given a source textual unit) (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). In this paper, we focus on the paraphrase generation problem.\nParaphrase generation has been used to gain performance improvements in several NLP applications, for example, by generating query variants or pattern alternatives for information retrieval, information extraction or question answering systems, by creating reference paraphrases for automatic evaluation of machine translation and document summarization systems, and by generating concise or simplified information for sentence compression or sentence simplification systems (Madnani and Dorr, 2010).\nTraditional paraphrase generation methods exploit hand-crafted rules (McKeown, 1983) or automatically learned complex paraphrase patterns (Zhao et al., 2009), use thesaurus-based (Hassan et al., 2007) or semantic analysis driven natural language generation approaches (Kozlowski et al., 2003), or leverage statistical machine learning theory (Quirk et al., 2004; Wubben et al., 2010). In this paper, we propose to use deep learning principles to address the paraphrase generation problem. Recently, techniques like sequence to sequence learning (Sutskever et al., 2014) have been applied to various NLP tasks with promising results, for example, in the areas of machine translation (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), speech recognition (Li and Wu, 2015), language modeling (Vinyals et al., 2015), and dialogue systems (Serban et al., 2016). Although paraphrase generation can be formulated as a sequence to sequence learning task, not much work has been done in this area with regard to applications of stateof-the-art deep neural networks. There are several works on paraphrase recognition (Socher et al., 2011; Yin and Schütze, 2015; Kiros et al., 2015), but those employ classification techniques and do not attempt to generate paraphrases. Another recent related work uses attention-based Long Short-Term Memory\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In the light of the lack of such prior work, we explore various types of sequence to sequence models for paraphrase generation. We test these models on three different datasets and evaluate these models using various metrics. Along with the application of various existing sequence to sequence models for the paraphrase generation task, in this paper we also propose a new model that allows for training multiple stacked LSTM networks by introducing a residual connection between the layers. This is inspired by the recent success of such connections in a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the image recognition task (He et al., 2015). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can outperform various other techniques we have explored. Most of the deep learning models in NLP use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). RNNs differ from normal perceptrons as they allow gradient propagation in time to model sequential data with variable-length input and output (Sutskever et al., 2011). In practice, RNNs often suffer from the vanishing/exploding gradient problems while learning long-range dependencies (Bengio et al., 1994). LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRU (Cho et al., 2014) are known to be successful remedies to these problems. It has been observed that increasing the depth of a deep neural network can improve the performance of the model (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2015) as deeper networks learn better representations of features (Farabet et al., 2013). In the vision related tasks where CNNs are more widely used, adding many layers of neurons is a common practice. For tasks like speech recognition (Li and Wu, 2015) and also in machine translation, it is useful to stack layers of LSTM or any other variants of RNN. So far this has been limited to only a few layers due to difficulty in training deep RNN networks. We propose to add residual connections between multiple stacked LSTM networks and show that this allows us to stack more layers of LSTM successfully.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a brief overview of the sequence to sequence models followed by a description of our proposed residual deep LSTM model, Section 3 describes the datasets used in this work, Section 4 explains the experimental setup, Section 5 presents the evaluation results and analyses, Section 6 discusses the related work, and finally, in Section 7 we conclude and discuss future work."

      "heading" : "2.1 Encoder-Decoder Model",
      "text" : "A neural approach to sequence to sequence modeling proposed by Sutskever et al. (2014) is a twocomponent model, where a source sequence is first encoded into some low dimensional representation (Figure 1) that is later used to reproduce the sequence back to a high dimensional target sequence (i.e. decoding). In machine translation, an encoder operates on text written in the source language and encodes the meaning of the sentence to be translated before the decoder can take that vector (which represents the meaning) and generate a sentence in the target language. These encoder-decoder blocks can be either a vanilla RNN or its variants. While producing the target sequence, the generation of each new word depends on the model and the last word generated. For the first word, this is done by appending a special ‘EOS’ (end-of-sentence) token to the source. The training objective is to maximize the log probability of the target sequence given the source sequence. Therefore, the best possible decoded target is the one that has the maximum score over the length of the sequence. To find this, a small set of hypotheses (candidate set) called beam size is used and the total score for all these hypotheses are computed. In the original work by Sutskever et al. (2014), they observe that even beam size of 1 gives a very good result but a higher beam size always does better. This is because for some of the hypotheses the first word may not have the highest score."

      "heading" : "2.2 Deep LSTM",
      "text" : "LSTM (Figure 2) is a RNN which adds an internal memory cell ct ∈Rn at every time step. An LSTM unit takes three inputs xt, ht−1, ct−1 at every time step and produces the hidden state, ht and the internal memory state, ct at time step t. The memory cell is controlled via three learned gates: input i, forget f , and output o. These memory cells use the addition of gradient with respect to time and thus minimize\nthe gradient explosion. In most NLP tasks, LSTM outperforms vanilla RNN (Sundermeyer et al., 2012). Therefore, for our model we only explore LSTM as a basic unit in the encoder and decoder. Here, we describe the basic computations in an LSTM unit, which will provide the grounding to understand the residual connections between stacked LSTM layers later. In the equations below, Wx ,Wh are the learned parameters for x and h respectively. σ(.) and tanh(.) denote element-wise sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions. is the element-wise multiplication operator and b denotes the added bias.\nGraves (2013) explored the advantages of deep LSTMs for handwriting recognition and text generation. There are multiple ways of combining one layer of LSTM with another. For example, Pascanu et al. (2013) explored multiple ways of combining them and discussed various difficulties in training deep LSTMs. In this work, we employ vertical stacking where only the output of the previous layer of LSTM is fed to the input, as compared to the stacking technique used by Sutskever et al. (2014), where hidden states of all LSTM layers are fully connected. In our model, all but the first layer input at time step t is passed from the hidden state of the previous layer hlt, where l denotes the layer. This is similar to stacked RNN proposed by Bengio et al. (1994) but with LSTM units. Thus, for a layer l the activation is described by:\nh (l) t = f l h(h (l−1) t ,h (l) t−1)\nwhere hidden states h are recursively computed and h(l)t at t = 0 and l = 0 is given by the LSTM equation of ht."

      "heading" : "2.3 Stacked Residual LSTM",
      "text" : "We take inspiration from a very successful deep learning network ResNet (He et al., 2015) with regard to adding residue for the purpose of learning. With theoretical and empirical reasoning, He et al. (2015)\nhave shown that the explicit addition of the residue x to the function being learned allows for deeper network training without overfitting the data.\nWhen stacking multiple layers of neurons, often the network suffers through a degradation problem (He et al., 2015). The degradation problem arises due to the low convergence rate of training error and is different from the vanishing gradient problem. Residual connections can help overcome this issue. We experimented with four-layers of stacked LSTM for each of the model. Residue connections is added at layer two as the pointwise addition (see Figure 3), and thus it requires the input to be in the same dimension as the output of ht. Principally because of this reason, we use a simple last hidden unit stacking of LSTM instead of a more intricate way as shown by Sutskever et al. (2014). This allowed us to clip the ht to match the dimension of xt−2 where they were not the same. Similar results could be achieved by padding x to match the dimension instead. The function ĥ that is being learned for the layer with residue connection is therefore:\nĥ (l) t = f l h(h (l−1) t ,h (l) t−1) + xl−n\nwhere ĥ for layer l is updated with residual value xl−n and xi represents the input to layer i+1. Residual connection is added after every n layers. However, for stacked LSTM n > 3 is very expensive in terms of computation. In this paper we experimented with n = 2. Note that when n = 1, the resulting function learned is a standard LSTM with bias that depends on the input x. That is why, it is not necessary to add the residue connection after every stacked layer of LSTM. Addition of residual connection does not add any learnable parameters. Therefore, this does not increase the complexity of model unlike bi-directional models which doubles the number of LSTM units."

      "heading" : "3 Datasets",
      "text" : "We present the performance of our model on three datasets, which are significantly different in their characteristics. PPDB (Pavlick et al., 2015) is a well known dataset used for various NLP tasks. It comes in different sizes and the precision of the paraphrases degrades with the size of the dataset. We use the sizeL dataset from PPDB 2.0, which comes with over 18M paraphrases including lexical, phrasal and syntactic types. We have omitted the syntactic paraphrases and the instances which contain numbers, as they increase the vocabulary size significantly without giving any advantage of a larger dataset. This dataset contains relatively short paraphrases (86% of the data is less than four words), which makes it suitable for synonym generation and phrase substitution to address lexical and phrasal paraphrasing (Madnani and Dorr, 2010). For some phrases, PPDB has one-to-many paraphrases. All such phrases were collected to make a set of paraphrases and sampling without replacement was used to obtain the source and reference phrases.\nWikiAnswers (Fader et al., 2013) is a large question paraphrase corpus created by crawling the WikiAnswers website1, where users can post questions and answers about any topic. The paraphrases\n1http://wiki.answers.com\nare different questions, which were tagged by the users as similar questions. The dataset contains approximately 18M word-aligned question pairs. There is some loss of specialization between the given source question (a paraphrase to be tagged as similar to the reference question) and the reference question. For example, “prepare a three month cash budget” is tagged to “how to prepare a cash budget”. This happens because it is more likely that a general question has been answered as they are more popular and specific ones are redirected to the general ones due to comparative lack of interest in a very specific question. It should be noted that this dataset has been lemmatized and some processing has been done in order to sanitize the large corpus. We refer the reader to the original paper for more details. MSCOCO (Lin et al., 2014) dataset contains human annotated captions of over 120K images. Each image contains five captions from five different annotators. While there is no guarantee that the human annotations are paraphrases, but because of the nature of the image (which tends to focus on only a few objects and in most cases one prominent object or action) most annotators describe the obvious thing in the image. In fact, this is the main reason why neural networks for generating captions obtain very good BLEU scores (Vinyals et al., 2014), which allows us to use this dataset for the paraphrase generation task."

This step gives us a total of 5.3M paraphrases from which we randomly select 90% instances for training and 20K pairs from the rest 10% data are selected similarly for testing. Although WikiAnswers comes with 29, 139, 992 instances, we randomly select 4, 826, 492 for training to keep the training size similar to PPDB (see Table 1). 20K instances are randomly selected from the remaining data for testing. Note that, for the WikiAnswers dataset, we had to clip the vocabulary size2 to 50K and use the special UNK symbol for the words outside the vocabulary. MSCOCO dataset has five captions for every image. This dataset comes with separate subsets for training and validation: Train 2014 contains over 82K images and Val 2014 contains over 40K images. From each set of five captions, we randomly select two pairs to use as training instances. The remaining caption is disregarded. Because of the free form nature of the caption generation task (Vinyals et al., 2014), some captions were very long. We clipped those captions to the size of 15 words in order to make the training feasible.\nDataset Training Test Vocabulary Size\nPPDB 4,826,492 20,000 38,279 WikiAnswers 4,826,492 20,000 50,000 MSCOCO 331,163 20,000 30,332\nTable 1: Dataset details\nModels Reference\nSequence to Sequence (Sutskever et al., 2014) With Attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) Bi-directional LSTM (Graves et al., 2013) Residual LSTM Our proposed model\nTable 2: Models"

For each model, we experimented with two- and four-layers of stacked LSTMs. This was motivated from the state-of-the-art speech recognition systems that also use three to four layers of stacked LSTMs (Li and Wu, 2015). In encoder-decoder models, the size of the beam search used during inference is very important. Larger beam size always gives higher accuracy but comes at a computational cost. We experimented with beam sizes of 5 and 10 to compare the models, as these are the most common beam sizes used in the literature (Sutskever et al., 2014). The bi-directional model used half of the number of layers shown for other models. This was done to ensure similar parameter sizes across the models.\n2WikiAnswers dataset had many spelling errors yielding a very large vocabulary size (approximately 250K). Hence, we selected the most frequent 50K words in the vocabulary to reduce the computational complexity."

      "heading" : "4.3 Training",
      "text" : "We used a one-hot vector approach to represent the words in all models. Models were trained with a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. The learning rate began at 1.0, and was halved after every third training epoch. Each network was trained for ten epochs. A standard dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) of 50% was applied after every LSTM layer. The number of LSTM units in each layer was fixed to 512 across all models. In order to allow exploration of a wide variety of models, training was restricted to a limited number of epochs, and no hyper-parameter search was performed. Training time ranged from 36 hours for WikiAnswers and PPDB to 14 hours for MSCOCO on a Titan X with CuDNN 5 using Theano version 0.9.0dev1 (Theano Development Team, 2016).\nA beam search algorithm was used to generate optimal paraphrases by exploiting the trained models in the testing phase (Sutskever et al., 2014). We used perplexity as the loss function during training. Perplexity measures the uncertainty of the language model, corresponding to how many bits on average would be needed to encode each word given the language model. A lower PPLX indicates a better score. While WikiAnswers and MSCOCO had a very good correlation of training and validation perplexity, PPDB easily overfitted our model and did not yield a good validation perplexity (see Figure 4)."

    }, {
      "heading" : "5.1 Metrics",
      "text" : "To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our paraphrase generation models, we use the well-known automatic evaluation metrics3 for comparing parallel corpora: BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), and Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006). Even though these metrics were designed for machine translation, previous works have shown that they can perform well for the paraphrase recognition task (Madnani et al., 2012) and correlate well with human judgments in evaluating generated paraphrases (Wubben et al., 2010).\nAlthough there exists a few automatic evaluation metrics that are specifically designed for paraphrase generation, such as PEM (Paraphrase Evaluation Metric) (Liu et al., 2010) and PINC (Paraphrase In Ngram Changes) (Chen and Dolan, 2011), they have certain limitations. PEM relies on large in-domain bilingual parallel corpora along with sample human ratings for training the metric and it can only model paraphrasing up to the phrase-level granularity. PINC attempts to solve these limitations by proposing a method that is essentially the inverse of BLEU, as it calculates the n-gram difference between the source and the target sentences. Although PINC correlates well with human judgments in lexical dissimilarity assessment, BLEU have been shown to correlate better for semantic equivalence agreements at the sentence-level when a sufficiently large number of reference sentences are available for each source sentence (Chen and Dolan, 2011). BLEU considers exact matching between reference paraphrases and system generated paraphrases by considering n-gram overlaps while METEOR improves upon this measure via stemming and synonymy\n3We used the software available at https://github.com/jhclark/multeval\nusing WordNet. TER measures the number of edits required to change a system output into one of the references. As suggested in (Clark et al., 2011), we used a stratified approximate randomization (AR) test. AR calculates the probability of a metric score providing the same reference sentence by chance. We report our p-values at 95% Confidence Intervals (CI). The major limitation of these evaluation metrics is that they do not consider the meaning of the paraphrases, and hence, are not able to capture paraphrases of entities. For example, these metrics will not reward the paraphrasing of Coke to Pepsi. However, in Word2Vec embeddings they will be considered as similar entities. Therefore, we also evaluate our models on a sentence similarity metric4 proposed by Rus et al. (2012). This metric uses word embeddings to compare the phrases. In our experiments, we used Word2Vec embeddings pre-trained on the Google News Corpus (Mikolov et al., 2014). This is referred as ‘Emb Greedy’ in our results table."

      "heading" : "5.2 Results",
      "text" : "We present the results from various models across different datasets (Table 3). Although our focus is on stacked residual LSTM, which is applicable only when there are more than two layers, we still present the scores from two layer LSTM as a baseline. This will provide a good comparison against deeper models. The results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms other models on BLEU and TER for all datasets. On Emb Greedy our model outperforms other models in all datasets except against the Attention model when beam size is 10. On METEOR our model outperforms other models on MSCOCO and WikiAnswers; however, for PPDB the simple sequence to sequence model has better scores. Note that, these results were obtained from using single models and no ensemble of any models was used.\nTo calculate BLEU and METEOR, four references were used for MSCOCO, and five for PPDB and WikiAnswers. In some instances WikiAnswers did not have five references for every source, hence, those were calculated on reduced references. In Table 4, we present the variance due to the test set selection. This is calculated using bootstrap re-sampling for each optimizer run (Clark et al., 2011). Variance due to optimizer instability was less than 0.1 in all cases. p-value of these tests are less than 0.05 in all cases. Thus, comparison between two models is significant at 95% CI if the difference in their score is more than the variance due to test set selection (Table 4)."

      "heading" : "5.3 Analysis",
      "text" : "Scores on various metrics vary a lot across the datasets, which is understandable because they are of different natures. PPDB contains very small phrases and thus does not score well with metrics like BLEU and METEOR which penalize short phrases. As shown in Figure 5 more than fifty percent of PPDB contains two or fewer words. This leads to a big difference between training and validation errors, as shown in Figure 4. From the results it is evident that deeper LSTMs always improve upon shallow ones. For beam size of 5 our model beats other models in all datasets. For beam size of 10, attention model has marginally better Emb Greedy score than our model. When we look at the qualitative results we notice that the bias in the dataset is exploited by the system which is a side effect of any form of learning on a limited dataset. We can see this effect in Table 5. For example an OBJECT is always paraphrased with an OBJECT. Shorter sentences always generate shorter paraphrases and same is true for longer sequences. Based on our results we see that the embedding-based metric correlates well with statistical metrics. Looking at Figure 4 and the results from Table 5, we can conclude that perplexity is a good loss function for training paraphrase generation models. However, a more ideal metric to fully encode the objective of paraphrasing should reward novelty and penalize redundancy during paraphrase generation."

      "text" : "Prior work for paraphrase generation have applied relatively different methodologies, typically using knowledge-driven approaches or statistical machine translation (SMT) principles. The knowledge-driven approaches for paraphrase generation (Madnani and Dorr, 2010) generally utilize hand-crafted rules (McKeown, 1983) or automatically learned complex paraphrase patterns (Zhao et al., 2009). Other related work uses thesaurus-based (Hassan et al., 2007) or semantic analysis-driven natural language\n4We used the software available at https://github.com/julianser/hed-dlg-truncated/\ngeneration approaches (Kozlowski et al., 2003) to generate paraphrases. In contrast, Quirk et al., (2004) show the effectiveness of SMT techniques for paraphrase generation given adequate monolingual parallel corpus extracted from comparable news articles. Wubben et al., (2010) propose a phrase-based SMT framework for sentential paraphrase generation by using a large aligned monolingual corpus of news headlines. Zhao et al., (2008) propose a combination of multiple resources to learn phrase-based paraphrase tables and corresponding feature functions to devise a log-linear SMT model. Other models generate application-specific paraphrases (Zhao et al., 2009), leverage bilingual parallel corpora (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005) or apply a multi-pivot approach to output candidate paraphrases (Zhao et al., 2010).\nNot much work has been done with regard to applications of deep learning for paraphrase generation. We explored several sources as potential large datasets. Recently, Weiting et al. (2015) took the PPDB dataset (sizeXL) and annotated phrases based on their paraphrasability. This dataset is called AnnotatedPPDB and contains 3000 pairs in total. In the same work, they also introduced another dataset called ML-Paraphrase for the purpose of evaluating bigram paraphrases. This dataset contains 327 instances. Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al., 2005) is another widely used dataset for paraphrase detection. MSRP contains 5800 pairs of sentences (obtained from various news sources) accompanied with human annotations. These datasets are too small and therefore not suitable for deep learning models.\nTo the best of our knowledge this is the first work on using residual connections with recurrent neural networks. However, we recently noticed that Toderici et al. (2016) used residual GRU to show an improvement in image compression rates for a given quality over JPEG. A Variant of residual network called DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016), which uses dense connections over every layer, has been shown to be effective for image recognition tasks setting state-of-the-art results in CIFAR and SVHN datasets. Such works demonstrate the efficacy of adding residual connections for training deep networks."

This is an extension to sequence to sequence learning, which has shown great promise for NLP tasks. Our model is able to outperform the state-of-the-art models for sequence to sequence learning. We have shown that stacking of residual LSTM layers is useful for paraphrase generation, but it may not perform equally well for machine translation because not every word in a source sequence needs to be substituted for paraphrasing. Residual connections help retain important words in the generated paraphrases.\nWe experimented on three different large scale datasets and reported results using various automatic evaluation metrics. We showed the use of the well-known MSCOCO dataset for paraphrase generation and demonstrated that the models can be trained effectively without the advantage of having the images. Regardless of this limitation, our model performed equally good on this dataset. We believe that we\nhave set strong baselines for neural paraphrase generation on these datasets. This will enable future researchers to easily compare and evaluate subsequent works in paraphrase generation.\nRecent advances in neural network with regard to learnable memory (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Graves et al., 2014) have enabled models to get one step closer to learn comprehension. It will be helpful to explore such networks for the paraphrase generation task. Also, it remains to be explored how unsupervised deep learning could be harnessed for paraphrase generation. It would be interesting to see if researchers working on image-captioning can employ neural paraphrase generation to augment their dataset."

(2014) is a twocomponent model, where a source sequence is first encoded into some low dimensional representation (Figure 1) that is later used to reproduce the sequence back to a high dimensional target sequence (i.e. decoding). In machine translation, an encoder operates on text written in the source language and encodes the meaning of the sentence to be translated before the decoder can take that vector (which represents the meaning) and generate a sentence in the target language. These encoder-decoder blocks can be either a vanilla RNN or its variants. While producing the target sequence, the generation of each new word depends on the model and the last word generated. For the first word, this is done by appending a special ‘EOS’ (end-of-sentence) token to the source. The training objective is to maximize the log probability of the target sequence given the source sequence. Therefore, the best possible decoded target is the one that has the maximum score over the length of the sequence. To find this, a small set of hypotheses (candidate set) called beam size is used and the total score for all these hypotheses are computed. In the original work by Sutskever et al.

Zhao et al., (2008) propose a combination of multiple resources to learn phrase-based paraphrase tables and corresponding feature functions to devise a log-linear SMT model.",

(2015) took the PPDB dataset (sizeXL) and annotated phrases based on their paraphrasability. This dataset is called AnnotatedPPDB and contains 3000 pairs in total. In the same work, they also introduced another dataset called ML-Paraphrase for the purpose of evaluating bigram paraphrases. This dataset contains 327 instances. Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MSRP) (Dolan et al., 2005) is another widely used dataset for paraphrase detection. MSRP contains 5800 pairs of sentences (obtained from various news sources) accompanied with human annotations. These datasets are too small and therefore not suitable for deep learning models. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work on using residual connections with recurrent neural networks. However, we recently noticed that Toderici et al. (2016) used residual GRU to show an improvement in image compression rates for a given quality over JPEG.",

Conventional paraphrase generation methods either leverage hand-written rules and thesauri-based alignments, or use statistical machine learning principles. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore deep learning models for paraphrase generation. Our primary contribution is a stacked residual LSTM network, where we add residual connections between LSTM layers. This allows for efficient training of deep LSTMs. We experiment with our model and other state-of-the-art deep learning models on three different datasets: PPDB, WikiAnswers and MSCOCO. Evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms sequence to sequence, attention-based and bi-directional LSTM models on BLEU, METEOR, TER and an embedding-based sentence similarity metric.",
