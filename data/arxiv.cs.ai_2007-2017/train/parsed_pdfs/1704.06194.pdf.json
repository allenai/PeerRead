      "text" : "Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems answer questions by obtaining information from KB tuples (Berant et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014; Bordes et al., 2015; Bast and Haussmann, 2015; Yih et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016). For an input question, these systems typically generate a KB query, which can be executed to retrieve the answers from a KB. Figure 1 illustrates the process used to parse two sample questions in a KBQA system: (a) a single-relation question, which can be answered with a single <head-entity, relation, tail-entity>KB tuple (Fader et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2014; Bordes et al., 2015); and (b) a more complex case, where some constraints need to be handled\nfor multiple entities in the question. The KBQA system in the figure performs two key tasks: (1) entity linking, which links n-grams in questions to KB entities, and (2) relation detection, which identifies the KB relation(s) a question refers to.\nThe main focus of this work is to improve the relation detection subtask and further explore how it can contribute to the KBQA system. Although general relation detection1 methods are well studied in the NLP community, such studies usually do not take the end task of KBQA into consideration. As a result, there is a significant gap between general relation detection studies and KB-specific relation detection. First, in most general relation detection tasks, the number of target relations is limited, normally smaller than 100. In contrast, in KBQA even a small KB, like Freebase2M (Bordes et al., 2015), contains more than 6,000 relation types. Second, relation detection for KBQA often becomes a zero-shot learning task, since some test instances may have unseen relations in the training data. For example, the SimpleQuestions (Bordes et al., 2015) data set has 14% of the golden test relations not observed in golden training tuples. Third, as shown in Figure 1(b), for some KBQA tasks like WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013), we need to predict a chain of relations instead of a single relation. This increases the number of target relation types and the sizes of candidate relation pools, further increasing the difficulty of KB relation detection. Owing to these reasons, KB relation detection is significantly more challenging compared to general relation detection tasks.\nThis paper improves KB relation detection to cope with the problems mentioned above. First, in order to deal with the unseen relations, we propose to break the relation names into word sequences for question-relation matching. Second, noticing\n1In the information extraction field such tasks are usually called relation extraction or relation classification.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n06 19\n4v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n7 M\nay 2\n01 7\nthat original relation names can sometimes help to match longer question contexts, we propose to build both relation-level and word-level relation representations. Third, we use deep bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) to learn different levels of question representations in order to match the different levels of relation information. Finally, we propose a residual learning method for sequence matching, which makes the model training easier and results in more abstract (deeper) question representations, thus improves hierarchical matching.\nIn order to assess how the proposed improved relation detection could benefit the KBQA end task, we also propose a simple KBQA implementation composed of two-step relation detection. Given an input question and a set of candidate entities retrieved by an entity linker based on the question, our proposed relation detection model plays a key role in the KBQA process: (1) Re-ranking the entity candidates according to whether they connect to high confident relations detected from the raw question text by the relation detection model. This step is important to deal with the ambiguities normally present in entity linking results. (2) Finding the core relation (chains) for each topic entity2 selection from a much smaller candidate entity set after re-ranking. The above steps are followed by an optional constraint detection step, when the question cannot be answered by single relations (e.g., multiple entities in the question). Finally the highest scored query from the above\n2Following Yih et al. (2015), here topic entity refers to the root of the (directed) query tree; and core-chain is the directed path of relation from root to the answer node.\nsteps is used to query the KB for answers. Our main contributions include: (i) An improved relation detection model by hierarchical matching between questions and relations with residual learning; (ii) We demonstrate that the improved relation detector enables our simple KBQA system to achieve state-of-the-art results on both single-relation and multi-relation KBQA tasks."

      "text" : "Relation Extraction Relation extraction (RE) is an important sub-field of information extraction. General research in this field usually works on a (small) pre-defined relation set, where given a text paragraph and two target entities, the goal is to determine whether the text indicates any types of relations between the entities or not. As a result RE is usually formulated as a classification task. Traditional RE methods rely on large amount of hand-crafted features (Zhou et al., 2005; Rink and Harabagiu, 2010; Sun et al., 2011). Recent research benefits a lot from the advancement of deep learning: from word embeddings (Nguyen and Grishman, 2014; Gormley et al., 2015) to deep networks like CNNs and LSTMs (Zeng et al., 2014; dos Santos et al., 2015; Vu et al., 2016) and attention models (Zhou et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016).\nThe above research assumes there is a fixed (closed) set of relation types, thus no zero-shot learning capability is required. The number of relations is usually not large: The widely used ACE2005 has 11/32 coarse/fine-grained relations; SemEval2010 Task8 has 19 relations; TAC-\nKBP2015 has 74 relations although it considers open-domain Wikipedia relations. All are much fewer than thousands of relations in KBQA. As a result, few work in this field focuses on dealing with large number of relations or unseen relations. Yu et al. (2016) proposed to use relation embeddings in a low-rank tensor method. However their relation embeddings are still trained in supervised way and the number of relations is not large in the experiments.\nRelation Detection in KBQA Systems Relation detection for KBQA also starts with featurerich approaches (Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Bast and Haussmann, 2015) towards usages of deep networks (Yih et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Dai et al., 2016) and attention models (Yin et al., 2016; Golub and He, 2016). Many of the above relation detection research could naturally support large relation vocabulary and open relation sets (especially for QA with OpenIE KB like ParaLex (Fader et al., 2013)), in order to fit the goal of open-domain question answering.\nDifferent KBQA data sets have different levels of requirement about the above open-domain capacity. For example, most of the gold test relations in WebQuestions can be observed during training, thus some prior work on this task adopted the close domain assumption like in the general RE research. While for data sets like SimpleQuestions and ParaLex, the capacity to support large relation sets and unseen relations becomes more necessary. To the end, there are two main solutions: (1) use pre-trained relation embeddings (e.g. from TransE (Bordes et al., 2013)), like (Dai et al., 2016); (2) factorize the relation names to sequences and formulate relation detection as a sequence matching and ranking task. Such factorization works because that the relation names usually comprise meaningful word sequences. For example, Yin et al. (2016) split relations to word sequences for single-relation detection. Liang et al. (2016) also achieve good performance on WebQSP with wordlevel relation representation in an end-to-end neural programmer model. Yih et al. (2015) use character tri-grams as inputs on both question and relation sides. Golub and He (2016) propose a generative framework for single-relation KBQA which predicts relation with a character-level sequenceto-sequence model.\nAnother difference between relation detection in KBQA and general RE is that general RE re-\nsearch assumes that the two argument entities are both available. Thus it usually benefits from features (Nguyen and Grishman, 2014; Gormley et al., 2015) or attention mechanisms (Wang et al., 2016) based on the entity information (e.g. entity types or entity embeddings). For relation detection in KBQA, such information is mostly missing because: (1) one question usually contains single argument (the topic entity) and (2) one KB entity could have multiple types (type vocabulary size larger than 1,500). This makes KB entity typing itself a difficult problem so no previous used entity information in the relation detection model.3"

      "text" : "KB Relations\nPrevious research (Yih et al., 2015; Yin et al., 2016) formulates KB relation detection as a sequence matching problem. However, while the questions are natural word sequences, how to represent relations as sequences remains a challenging problem. Here we give an overview of two types of relation sequence representations commonly used in previous work.\n(1) Relation Name as a Single Token (relationlevel). In this case, each relation name is treated as a unique token. The problem with this approach is that it suffers from the low relation coverage due to limited amount of training data, thus cannot generalize well to large number of opendomain relations. For example, in Figure 1, when treating relation names as single tokens, it will be difficult to match the questions to relation names “episodes written” and “starring roles” if these names do not appear in training data – their relation embeddings hrs will be random vectors thus are not comparable to question embeddings hqs.\n(2) Relation as Word Sequence (word-level). In this case, the relation is treated as a sequence of words from the tokenized relation name. It has better generalization, but suffers from the lack of global information from the original relation names. For example in Figure 1(b), when doing only word-level matching, it is difficult to rank the target relation “starring roles” higher compared to the incorrect relation “plays produced”. This is because the incorrect relation contains word “plays”, which is more similar to the question\n3Such entity information has been used in KBQA systems as features for the final answer re-rankers.\n(containing word “play”) in the embedding space. On the other hand, if the target relation co-occurs with questions related to “tv appearance” in training, by treating the whole relation as a token (i.e. relation id), we could better learn the correspondence between this token and phrases like “tv show” and “play on”.\nThe two types of relation representation contain different levels of abstraction. As shown in Table 1, the word-level focuses more on local information (words and short phrases), and the relation-level focus more on global information (long phrases and skip-grams) but suffer from data sparsity. Since both these levels of granularity have their own pros and cons, we propose a hierarchical matching approach for KB relation detection: for a candidate relation, our approach matches the input question to both word-level and relation-level representations to get the final ranking score. Section 4 gives the details of our proposed approach."

Therefore, the input relation becomes r = {rword1 , · · · , rwordM1 } ∪ {r rel 1 , · · · , rrelM2}, where the first M1 tokens are words (e.g. {episode, written}), and the last M2 tokens are relation names, e.g., {episode written} or {starring roles, series} (when the target is a chain like in Figure 1(b)). We transform each token above to its word embed-\nding then use two BiLSTMs (with shared parameters) to get their hidden representations [Bword1:M1 : Brel1:M2 ] (each row vector βi is the concatenation between forward/backward representations at i). We initialize the relation sequence LSTMs with the final state representations of the word sequence, as a back-off for unseen relations. We apply one max-pooling on these two sets of vectors and get the final relation representation hr."

      "text" : "From Table 1, we can see that different parts of a relation could match different contexts of question texts. Usually relation names could match longer phrases in the question and relation words could match short phrases. Yet different words might match phrases of different lengths.\nAs a result, we hope the question representations could also comprise vectors that summarize various lengths of phrase information (different levels of abstraction), in order to match relation representations of different granularity. We deal with this problem by applying deep BiLSTMs on questions. The first-layer of BiLSTM works on the word embeddings of question words q = {q1, · · · , qN} and gets hidden representations Γ (1) 1:N = [γ (1) 1 ; · · · ;γ (1) N ]. The second-layer BiLSTM works on Γ(1)1:N to get the second set of hidden representations Γ(2)1:N . Since the second BiLSTM starts with the hidden vectors from the first layer, intuitively it could learn more general and abstract information compared to the first layer.\nNote that the first(second)-layer of question representations does not necessarily correspond to the word(relation)-level relation representations, instead either layer of question representations could potentially match to either level of relation representations. This raises the difficulty of matching between different levels of relation/question representations; the following section gives our proposal to deal with such problem."

      "text" : "Now we have question contexts of different lengths encoded in Γ(1)1:N and Γ (2) 1:N . Unlike the standard usage of deep BiLSTMs that employs the representations in the final layer for prediction, here we expect that two layers of question representations can be complementary to each other and both should be compared to the relation representation space (Hierarchical Matching). This is important for our task since each relation token can correspond to phrases of different lengths, mainly because of syntactic variations. For example in Table 1, the relation word written could be matched to either the same single word in the question or a much longer phrase be the writer of.\nWe could perform the above hierarchical matching by computing the similarity between each layer of Γ and hr separately and doing the (weighted) sum between the two scores. However this does not give significant improvement (see Table 2). Our analysis in Section 6.2 shows that this naive method suffers from the training difficulty, evidenced by that the converged training loss of this model is much higher than that of a single-layer baseline model. This is mainly because (1) Deep BiLSTMs do not guarantee that the two-levels of question hidden representations are comparable, the training usually falls to local optima where one layer has good matching scores and the other always has weight close to 0. (2)\nThe training of deeper architectures itself is more difficult.\nTo overcome the above difficulties, we adopt the idea from Residual Networks (He et al., 2016) for hierarchical matching by adding shortcut connections between two BiLSTM layers. We proposed two ways of such Hierarchical Residual Matching: (1) Connecting each γ(1)i and γ (2) i , resulting in a γ ′ i = γ (1) i +γ (2) i for each position i. Then the final question representation hq becomes a maxpooling over all γ\n′ is, 1≤i≤N . (2) Applying max-\npooling on Γ(1)1:N and Γ (2) 1:N to get h (1) max and h (2) max, respectively, then setting hq = h(1)max + h (2) max. Finally we compute the matching score of r given q as srel(r;q) = cos(hr,hq).\nIntuitively, the proposed method should benefit from hierarchical training since the second layer is fitting the residues from the first layer of matching, so the two layers of representations are more likely to be complementary to each other. This also ensures the vector spaces of two layers are comparable and makes the second-layer training easier.\nDuring training we adopt a ranking loss to maximizing the margin between the gold relation r+ and other relations r− in the candidate pool R.\nlrel = max{0, γ − srel(r+;q) + srel(r−;q)} where γ is a constant parameter. Fig 2 summarizes the above Hierarchical Residual BiLSTM (HR-BiLSTM) model.\nRemark: Another way of hierarchical matching consists in relying on attention mechanism, e.g. (Parikh et al., 2016), to find the correspondence between different levels of representations. This performs below the HR-BiLSTM (see Table 2)."

We make minimal efforts beyond the training of the relation detection model, making the whole system easy to build.\nFollowing previous work (Yih et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016), our KBQA system takes an existing entity linker to produce the top-K linked entities, ELK(q), for a question q (“initial entity linking”). Then we generate the KB queries for q following the four steps illustrated in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1: KBQA with two-step relation detection Input : Question q, Knowledge Base KB, the initial\ntop-K entity candidates ELK(q) Output: Top query tuple (ê, r̂, {(c, rc)})\n1 Entity Re-Ranking (first-step relation detection): Use the raw question text as input for a relation detector to score all relations in the KB that are associated to the entities in ELK(q); use the relation scores to re-rank ELK(q) and generate a shorter list EL′K′(q) containing the top-K′ entity candidates (Section 5.1) 2 Relation Detection: Detect relation(s) using the reformatted question text in which the topic entity is replaced by a special token <e> (Section 5.2) 3 Query Generation: Combine the scores from step 1 and 2, and select the top pair (ê, r̂) (Section 5.3) 4 Constraint Detection (optional): Compute similarity between q and any neighbor entity c of the entities along r̂ (connecting by a relation rc) , add the high scoring c and rc to the query (Section 5.4).\nCompared to previous approaches, the main difference is that we have an additional entity reranking step after the initial entity linking. We have this step because we have observed that entity linking sometimes becomes a bottleneck in KBQA systems. For example, on SimpleQuestions the best reported linker could only get 72.7% top-1 accuracy on identifying topic entities. This is usually due to the ambiguities of entity names, e.g. in Fig 1(a), there are TV writer and baseball player “Mike Kelley”, which is impossible to distinguish with only entity name matching.\nHaving observed that different entity candidates usually connect to different relations, here we propose to help entity disambiguation in the initial entity linking with relations detected in questions.\nSections 5.1 and 5.2 elaborate how our relation detection help to re-rank entities in the initial entity linking, and then those re-ranked entities enable more accurate relation detection. The KBQA end task, as a result, benefits from this process."

We call this step relation detection on entity set since it does not work on a single topic entity as the usual settings. We use the HR-BiLSTM as described in Sec. 4. For each question q, after generating a score srel(r; q) for each relation using HR-BiLSTM, we use the top l best scoring relations (Rlq) to re-rank the original entity candidates. Concretely, for each entity e and its associated relations Re, given the original entity linker score slinker, and the score of the most confident relation r ∈ Rlq∩Re, we sum these two scores to re-rank the entities:\nsrerank(e; q) =α · slinker(e; q) +(1− α) · max\nr∈Rlq∩Re srel(r; q).\nFinally, we select topK ′ <K entities according to score srerank to form the re-ranked list EL ′ K′(q).\nWe use the same example in Fig 1(a) to illustrate the idea. Given the input question in the example, a relation detector is very likely to assign high scores to relations such as “episodes written”, “author of ” and “profession”. Then, according to the connections of entity candidates in KB, we find that the TV writer “Mike Kelley” will be scored higher than the baseball player “Mike Kelley”, because the former has the relations “episodes written” and “profession”.

However we still achieve state-of-the-art on WebQSP in Sec.6, showing the advantage of our relation detection model. We leave in future work beam-search and feature extraction on beam for final answer re-ranking like in previous research.\nSimpleQuestions (SQ): It is a single-relation KBQA task. The KB we use consists of a Freebase subset with 2M entities (FB2M) (Bordes et al., 2015), in order to compare with previous research. Yin et al. (2016) also evaluated their relation extractor on this data set and released their proposed question-relation pairs, so we run our relation detection model on their data set. For the KBQA evaluation, we also start with their entity linking results6. Therefore, our results can be compared with their reported results on both tasks. WebQSP (WQ): A multi-relation KBQA task. We use the entire Freebase KB for evaluation purposes. Following Yih et al. (2016), we use S-MART (Yang and Chang, 2015) entity-linking outputs.7 In order to evaluate the relation detection models, we create a new relation detection task from the WebQSP data set.8 For each question and its labeled semantic parse: (1) we first select the topic entity from the parse; and then (2) select all the relations and relation chains (length ≤ 2) connected to the topic entity, and set the corechain labeled in the parse as the positive label and all the others as the negative examples.\nWe tune the following hyper-parameters on development sets: (1) the size of hidden states for LSTMs ({50, 100, 200, 400})9; (2) learning rate ({0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}); (3) whether the shortcut connections are between hidden states or between max-pooling results (see Section 4.3); and (4) the number of training epochs.\nFor both the relation detection experiments and the second-step relation detection in KBQA, we have entity replacement first (see Section 5.2 and Figure 1).

Our proposed HR-BiLSTM outperformed the best baselines on both tasks by margins of 2-3% (p < 0.001 and 0.01 compared to the best baseline BiLSTM w/ words on SQ and WQ respectively).\nNote that using only relation names instead of words results in a weaker baseline BiLSTM model. The model yields a significant performance drop on SimpleQuestions (91.2% to 88.9%). However, the drop is much smaller on WebQSP, and it suggests that unseen relations have a much bigger impact on SimpleQuestions.\nAblation Test: The bottom of Table 2 shows ablation results of the proposed HR-BiLSTM. First, hierarchical matching between questions and both relation names and relation words yields improvement on both datasets, especially for SimpleQuestions (93.3% vs. 91.2/88.8%). Second, residual learning helps hierarchical matching compared to weighted-sum and attention-based baselines (see Section 4.3).

Note that residual learning significantly helps on WebQSP (80.65% to\n10We also tried to apply the same attention method on deep BiLSTM with residual connections, but it does not lead to better results compared to HR-BiLSTM. We hypothesize that the idea of hierarchical matching with attention mechanism may work better for long sequences, and the new advanced attention mechanisms (Wang and Jiang, 2016; Wang et al., 2017) might help hierarchical matching. We leave the above directions to future work.\n82.53%), while it does not help as much on SimpleQuestions. On SimpleQuestions, even removing the deep layers only causes a small drop in performance. WebQSP benefits more from residual and deeper architecture, possibly because in this dataset it is more important to handle larger scope of context matching.\nFinally, on WebQSP, replacing BiLSTM with CNN in our hierarchical matching framework results in a large performance drop. Yet on SimpleQuestions the gap is much smaller. We believe this is because the LSTM relation encoder can better learn the composition of chains of relations in WebQSP, as it is better at dealing with longer dependencies.\nAnalysis Next, we present empirical evidences, which show why our HR-BiLSTM model achieves the best scores. We use WebQSP for the analysis purposes. First, we have the hypothesis that training of the weighted-sum model usually falls to local optima, since deep BiLSTMs do not guarantee that the two-levels of question hidden representations are comparable. This is evidenced by that during training one layer usually gets a weight close to 0 thus is ignored. For example, one run gives us weights of -75.39/0.14 for the two layers (we take exponential for the final weighted sum). It also gives much lower training accuracy (91.94%) compared to HR-BiLSTM (95.67%), suffering from training difficulty.\nSecond, compared to our deep BiLSTM with shortcut connections, we have the hypothesis that for KB relation detection, training deep BiLSTMs is more difficult without shortcut connections. Our experiments suggest that deeper BiLSTM does not always result in lower training accuracy. In the experiments a two-layer BiLSTM converges to 94.99%, even lower than the 95.25% achieved by a\nsingle-layer BiLSTM. Under our setting the twolayer model captures the single-layer model as a special case (so it could potentially better fit the training data), this result suggests that the deep BiLSTM without shortcut connections might suffers more from training difficulty.\nFinally, we hypothesize that HR-BiLSTM is more than combination of two BiLSTMs with residual connections, because it encourages the hierarchical architecture to learn different levels of abstraction. To verify this, we replace the deep BiLSTM question encoder with two single-layer BiLSTMs (both on words) with shortcut connections between their hidden states. This decreases test accuracy to 76.11%. It gives similar training accuracy compared to HR-BiLSTM, indicating a more serious over-fitting problem. This proves that the residual and deep structures both contribute to the good performance of HR-BiLSTM."

In order to highlight the effect of different relation detection models on the KBQA end-task, we also implemented another baseline that uses our KBQA system but replaces HR-BiLSTM with our implementation of AMPCNN (for SimpleQuestions) or the char-3-gram BiCNN (for WebQSP) relation detectors (second block in Table 3).\nCompared to the baseline relation detector (3rd row of results), our method, which includes an improved relation detector (HR-BiLSTM), improves the KBQA end task by 2-3% (4th row). Note that in contrast to previous KBQA systems, our system does not use joint-inference or feature-based re-ranking step, nevertheless it still achieves better or comparable results to the state-of-the-art.\nThe third block of the table details two ablation tests for the proposed components in our KBQA systems: (1) Removing the entity re-ranking step significantly decreases the scores. Since the reranking step relies on the relation detection models, this shows that our HR-BiLSTM model contributes to the good performance in multiple ways.\n11The STAGG score on SQ is from (Bao et al., 2016).\nAppendix C gives the detailed performance of the re-ranking step. (2) In contrast to the conclusion in (Yih et al., 2015), constraint detection is crucial for our system12. This is probably because our joint performance on topic entity and core-chain detection is more accurate (77.5% top-1 accuracy), leaving a huge potential (77.5% vs. 58.0%) for the constraint detection module to improve.\nFinally, like STAGG, which uses multiple relation detectors (see Yih et al. (2015) for the three models used), we also try to use the top-3 relation detectors from Section 6.2. As shown on the last row of Table 3, this gives a significant performance boost, resulting in a new state-of-the-art result on SimpleQuestions and a result comparable to the state-of-the-art on WebQSP."

      "text" : "KB relation detection is a key step in KBQA and is significantly different from general relation extraction tasks. We propose a novel KB relation detection model, HR-BiLSTM, that performs hierarchical matching between questions and KB relations. Our model outperforms the previous methods on KB relation detection tasks and allows our KBQA system to achieve state-of-the-arts. For future work, we will investigate the integration of our HR-BiLSTM into end-to-end systems. For example, our model could be integrated into the decoder in (Liang et al., 2016), to provide better sequence prediction. We will also investigate new emerging datasets like GraphQuestions (Su et al., 2016) and ComplexQuestions (Bao et al., 2016) to handle more characteristics of general QA.\n12Note that another reason is that we are evaluating on accuracy here. When evaluating on F1 the gap will be smaller."

For a mention m of the entity e which is an n-gram in q, we compute the longest consecutive common sub-sequence between m and e, and denote its length as |m ∩ e|. All the lengths above are measured by the number of characters.\nBased on the above numbers we compute the proportions of the length of the overlap between entity mention and entity name (in characters) in the entity name |m∩e||e| and in the question |m∩e| |q| ; The final score for the question has a mention linking to e is\nslinker(e; q) = max m |m ∩ e| |q| + |m ∩ e| |e|"

This makes the overlap between the date entities in questions and the KB entity names smaller (length of overlap is usually 4). To deal with this, we only check whether the dates in questions could match the years in KB, thus have a special threshold of θ = 1 for date constraints.\n2. Filtering the constraints for answer nodes. Sometimes the answer node could connect to huge number of other nodes, e.g. when the question is asking for a country and we have an answer candidate the U.S.. From the observation on the WebQSP datasets, we found that for most of the time, the gold constraints on answers are their entity types (e.g., whether the question is asking for a country or a city). Based on this observation, in the constraint detection step, for the answer nodes we only keep the tuples with type relations (i.e. the relation name contains the word “type”), such as common.topic.notable types, education.educational institution.school type etc."

This is indicating another important usage of our proposed improved relation detection model on entity linking re-ranking."

Our method uses deep residual bidirectional LSTMs to compare questions and relation names via different levels of abstraction. Additionally, we propose a simple KBQA system that integrates entity linking and our proposed relation detector to make the two components enhance each other. Our experimental results show that our approach not only achieves outstanding relation detection performance, but more importantly, it helps our KBQA system achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for both single-relation (SimpleQuestions) and multi-relation (WebQSP) QA benchmarks.",
