      "text" : "The need for measuring distance or similarity between data instances is ubiquitous in machine learning and many application domains. However, each problem has its own underlying semantic space for defining distances that standard metrics (e.g., the Euclidean distance) often fail to capture. This has led to a growing interest in metric learning for the past few years, as summarized in two recent surveys (Bellet et al., 2013; Kulis, 2012). Among these methods, learning a globally linear Mahalanobis distance is by far the most studied setting. Representative methods include (Xing et al., 2002; Goldberger et al., 2004; Davis et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2008; Weinberger and Saul, 2009; Shen et al., 2012; Ying and Li, 2012). This is equivalent to learning a linear projection of the data to a feature space where constraints on the training set (such as “xi should be closer to xj than to xk”) are better satisfied.\nAlthough the performance of these learned metrics is typically superior to that of standard metrics in practice, a single linear metric is often unable to accurately capture the complexity of the task, for instance when the data are multimodal or the decision boundary is complex. To overcome this limitation, recent work has focused on learning multiple locally linear metrics at several locations of the feature space (Frome et al., 2007; Weinberger and Saul, 2009; Zhan et al., 2009; Hong et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012), to the extreme of learning one metric per training instance (Noh et al., 2010). This line of research is motivated by the fact that locally, simple linear metrics perform well (Ramanan and Baker, 2011; Hauberg et al., 2012). The main challenge is to integrate these metrics into a meaningful global one while keeping the number of learning parameters to a reasonable level in order to avoid heavy computational burden and severe overfitting. So far, existing methods are not able to compute valid (smooth) global metrics from the local metrics they learn and do not provide a principled way of generalizing to new regions of the space at test time. Furthermore,\n∗This document is an extended version of a conference paper (Shi et al., 2014) that provides additional details and results. †Equal contribution. ‡Department of Computer Science, University of Southern California, {yuanshi,bellet,feisha}@usc.edu.\nar X\niv :1\n40 4.\n41 05\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 5\nA pr\n2 01\n4\nthey scale poorly with the dimensionality D of the data: typically, learning a Mahalanobis distance requires O(D2) parameters and the optimization involves projections onto the positive semidefinite cone that scale in O(D3). This is expensive even for a single metric when D is moderately large.\nIn this paper, we study metric learning from a new perspective to efficiently address these key challenges. We propose to learn metrics as sparse compositions of locally discriminative metrics. These “basis metrics” are low-rank and extracted efficiently from the training data at different local regions, for instance using Fisher discriminant analysis. Learning higher-rank linear metrics is then formulated as learning the combining weights, using sparsity-inducing regularizers to select only the most useful basis elements. This provides a unified framework for metric learning, as illustrated in Figure 1, that we call SCML (for Sparse Compositional Metric Learning). In SCML, the number of parameters to learn is much smaller than existing approaches and projections onto the positive semidefinite cone are not needed. This gives an efficient and flexible way to learn a single global metric when D is large.\nThe proposed framework also applies to multi-task metric learning, where one wants to learn a global metric for several related tasks while exploiting commonalities between them (Caruana, 1997; Parameswaran and Weinberger, 2010). This is done in a natural way by means of a group sparsity regularizer that makes the task-specific metrics share the same basis subset. Our last and arguably most interesting contribution is a new formulation for local metric learning, where we learn a transformation T (x) that takes as input any instance x and outputs a sparse weight vector defining its metric. This can be seen as learning a smoothly varying metric tensor over the feature space (Ramanan and Baker, 2011; Hauberg et al., 2012). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first discriminative metric learning approach capable of computing, in a principled way, an instance-specific metric for any point in the feature space. All formulations can be solved using scalable optimization procedures based on stochastic subgradient descent with proximal operators (Duchi and Singer, 2009; Xiao, 2010).\nWe present both theoretical and experimental evidence supporting the proposed approach. We derive a generalization bound which provides a theoretical justification to seeking sparse combinations and suggests that the basis set B can be large without incurring overfitting. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithms against state-of-the-art global, local and multi-task metric learning methods on several datasets. The results strongly support the proposed framework.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our general framework and illustrates how it can be used to derive efficient formulations for global, local and multi-task metric learning. Section 3\nprovides a theoretical analysis supporting our approach. Section 4 reviews related work. Section 5 presents an experimental evaluation of the proposed methods. We conclude in Section 6."

      "text" : "We assume the data lie in RD and focus on learning (squared) Mahalanobis distances dM (x,x′) = (x − x′)TM(x − x′) parameterized by a positive semidefinite (PSD) D × D matrix M . Note that M can be represented as a nonnegative weighted sum of K rank-1 PSD matrices:1\nM = K∑ i=1 wibib T i , with w ≥ 0, (1)\nwhere the bi’s are D-dimensional column vectors. In this paper, we use the form (1) to cast metric learning as learning a sparse combination of basis elements taken from a basis set B = {bi}Ki=1. The key to our framework is the fact that such a B is made readily available to the algorithm and consists of rank-one metrics that are locally discriminative. Such basis elements can be easily generated from the training data at several local regions — in the experiments, we simply use Fisher discriminant analysis (see the corresponding section for details). They can then be combined to form a single global metric, multiple global metrics (in the multi-task setting) or a metric tensor (implicitly defining an infinite number of local metrics) that varies smoothly across the feature space, as we will show in later sections.\nWe use the notation dw(x,x′) to highlight our parameterization of the Mahalanobis distance by w. Learning M in this form makes it PSD by design (as a nonnegative sum of PSD matrices) and involves K parameters (instead of D2 in most metric learning methods), enabling it to more easily deal with highdimensional problems. We also want the combination to be sparse, i.e., some wi’s are zero and thus M only depends on a small subset of B. This provides some form of regularization (as shown later in Theorem 1) as well as a way to tie metrics together when learning multiple metrics. In the rest of this section, we apply the proposed framework to several metric learning paradigms (see Figure 1). We start with the simple case of global metric learning (Section 2.1.1) before considering more challenging settings: multi-task (Section 2.1.2) and local metric learning (Section 2.1.3). Finally, Section 2.2 discusses how these formulations can be solved in a scalable way using stochastic subgradient descent with proximal operators."

Here, we use a set of triplet constraints C where each (xi,xj ,xk) ∈ C indicates that the distance between xi and xj should be smaller than the distance between xi and xk. C may be constructed from label information, as in LMNN (Weinberger and Saul, 2009), or in an unsupervised manner based for instance on implicit users’ feedback (such as clicks on search engine results). Our formulation for global\n1Such an expression exists for any PSD matrix M since the eigenvalue decomposition of M is of the form (1).\nmetric learning, SCML-Global, is simply to combine the local basis elements into a higher-rank global metric that satisfies well the constraints in C:\nmin w\n1 |C| ∑\n(xi,xj ,xk)∈C\nLw(xi,xj ,xk) + β‖w‖1, (2)\nwhere Lw(xi,xj ,xk) = [1 + dw(xi,xj) − dw(xi,xk)]+ with [·]+ = max(0, ·), and β ≥ 0 is a regularization parameter. The first term in (2) is the classic margin-based hinge loss function. The second term ‖w‖1 = ∑K i=1wi is the `1 norm regularization which encourages sparse solutions, allowing the selection of relevant basis elements. SCML-Global is convex by the linearity of both terms and is bounded below, thus it has a global minimum."

      "heading" : "2.1.2 Multi-Task Metric Learning",
      "text" : "Multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997) is a paradigm for learning several tasks simultaneously, exploiting their commonalities. When tasks are related, this can perform better than separately learning each task. Recently, multi-task learning methods have successfully built on the assumption that the tasks should share a common low-dimensional representation (Argyriou et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Gong et al., 2012). In general, it is unclear how to achieve this in metric learning. In contrast, learning metrics as sparse combinations allows a direct translation of this idea to multi-task metric learning.\nFormally, we are given T different but somehow related tasks with associated constraint setsC1, . . . , CT and we aim at learning a metric dwt(x,x\n′) for each task t while sharing information across tasks. In the following, the basis set B is the union of the basis sets B1, . . . , BT extracted from each task t. Our formulation for multi-task metric learning, mt-SCML, is as follows:\nmin W T∑ t=1 1 |Ct| ∑\n(xi,xj ,xk)∈Ct\nLwt(xi,xj ,xk) + β‖W ‖2,1,\nwhere W is a T × K nonnegative matrix whose t-th row is the weight vector wt defining the metric for task t, Lwt(xi,xj ,xk) = [1 + dwt(xi,xj)− dwt(xi,xk)]+ and ‖W ‖2,1 is the `2/`1 mixed norm used in the group lasso problem (Yuan and Lin, 2006). It corresponds to the `1 norm applied to the `2 norm of the columns of W and is known to induce group sparsity at the column level. In other words, this regularization makes most basis elements either have zero weight or nonzero weight for all tasks.\nOverall, while each metric remains task-specific (dwt is only required to satisfy well the constraints in Ct), it is composed of shared features (i.e., it potentially benefits from basis elements generated from other tasks) that are regularized to be relevant across tasks (as favored by the group sparsity). As a result, all learned metrics can be expressed as combinations of the same basis subset of B, though with different weights for each task. Since the `2/`1 norm is convex, mt-SCML is again convex."

      "heading" : "2.1.3 Local Metric Learning",
      "text" : "Local metric learning addresses the limitations of global methods in capturing complex data patterns (Frome et al., 2007; Weinberger and Saul, 2009; Zhan et al., 2009; Noh et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2012). For heterogeneous data, allowing the metric to vary across the feature space can capture the semantic distance much better. On the other hand, local metric learning is costly and often suffers from severe overfitting since the number of parameters to learn can be very large. In the following, we show how our framework can be used to derive an efficient local metric learning method.\nWe aim at learning a metric tensor T (x), which is a smooth function that (informally) maps any instance x to its metric matrix (Ramanan and Baker, 2011; Hauberg et al., 2012). The distance between two points should then be defined as the geodesic distance on a Riemannian manifold. However, this requires solving an intractable problem, so we use the widely-adopted simplification that distances from point x are computed based on its own metric alone (Zhan et al., 2009; Noh et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012):\ndT (x,x ′) = (x− x′)TT (x)(x− x′)\n= (x− x′)T K∑ i=1 wx,ibib T i (x− x′),\nwhere wx is the weight vector for instance x. We could learn a weight vector for each training point. This would result in a formulation similar to mt-SCML, where each training instance is considered as a task. However, in the context of local metric learning, this is not an appealing solution. Indeed, for a training sample of size S we would need to learn SK parameters, which is computationally difficult and leads to heavy overfitting for large-scale problems. Furthermore, this gives no principled way of computing the weight vector of a test instance.\nWe instead propose a more effective solution by constraining the weight vector for an instance x to parametrically depend on some embedding of x:\nTA,c(x) = K∑ i=1 (aTi zx + ci) 2bib T i , (3)\nwhere zx ∈ D′ is an embedding of x,2 A = [a1 . . .aK ]T is a D′ × K real-valued matrix and c ∈ RK . The square makes the weights nonnegative ∀x ∈ RD, ensuring that they define a valid (pseudo) metric. Intuitively, (3) combines the locally discriminative metrics with weights that depend on the position of the instance in the feature space.\nThere are several advantages to this formulation. First, by learning A and c we implicitly learn a different metric not only for the training data but for any point in the feature space. Second, if the embedding is smooth, TA,c(x) is a smooth function of x, therefore similar instances are assigned similar weights. This can be seen as some kind of manifold regularization. Third, the number of parameters to learn is now K(D′ + 1), thus independent of both the size of the training sample and the dimensionality of x. Our formulation for local metric learning, SCML-Local, is as follows:\nmin Ã\n1 |C| ∑\n(xi,xj ,xk)∈C\nLTA,c(xi,xj ,xk) + β‖Ã‖2,1,\nwhere Ã is a (D′ + 1) × K matrix denoting the concatenation of A and c, and LTA,c(xi,xj ,xk) =[ 1 + dTA,c(xi,xj)− dTA,c(xi,xk) ] +\n. The `2/`1 norm on Ã introduces sparsity at the column level, regularizing the local metrics to use the same basis subset. Interestingly, if A is the zero matrix, we recover SCML-Global. SCML-Local is nonconvex and is thus subject to local minima."

We use RBF kernel with bandwidth set to the median Euclidean distance in the data.\n2009; Xiao, 2010), which alternates between a stochastic subgradient step on the hinge loss term and a proximal operator (for `1 or `2,1 norm) that explicitly induces sparsity. We solve SCML-Global and mt-SCML using Regularized Dual Averaging (Xiao, 2010), which offers fast convergence and levels of sparsity in the solution comparable to batch algorithms. For SCML-Local, due to local minima, we ensure improvement over the optimal solution w∗ of SCML-Global by using a forward-backward algorithm (Duchi and Singer, 2009) which is initialized with A = 0 and ci = √ w∗i .\nRecall that unlike most existing metric learning algorithms, we do not need to perform projections onto the PSD cone, which scale in O(D3) for a D × D matrix.

      "text" : "In this section, we review relevant work in global, multi-task and local metric learning. The interested reader should refer to the recent surveys of Kulis (2012) and Bellet et al. (2013) for more details.\nGlobal methods Most global metric learning methods learn the matrix M directly: see (Xing et al., 2002; Goldberger et al., 2004; Davis et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2008; Weinberger and Saul, 2009) for representative papers. This is computationally expensive and subject to overfitting for moderate to high-dimensional problems. An exception is BoostML (Shen et al., 2012) which uses rank-one matrices as weak learners to learn a global Mahalanobis distance via a boosting procedure. However, it is not clear how BoostML can be generalized to multi-task or local metric learning.\nMulti-task methods Multi-task metric learning was proposed in (Parameswaran and Weinberger, 2010) as an extension to the popular LMNN (Weinberger and Saul, 2009). The authors define the metric for task t as dt(x,x′) = (x − x′)T(M0 +Mt)(x − x′), where Mt is task-specific and M0 is shared by all tasks. Note that it is straightforward to incorporate their approach in our framework by defining a shared weight vector w0 and task-specific weights wt. However, this assumption of a metric that is common to all tasks can be too restrictive in cases where task relatedness is complex, as illustrated by our experiments.\nLocal methods MM-LMNN (Weinberger and Saul, 2009) is an extension of LMNN which learns only a small number of metrics (typically one per class) in an effort to alleviate overfitting. However, no additional regularization is used and a full-rank metric is learned for each class, which becomes intractable when the number of classes is large. msNCA (Hong et al., 2011) learns a function that splits the space into a small number of regions and then learns a metric per region using NCA (Goldberger et al., 2004). Again, the metrics are full-rank so msNCA does not scale well with the number of metrics. Like SCML-Local, PLML (Wang et al., 2012) is based on a combination of metrics but there are major differences with our work: (i) weights only depend on a manifold assumption: they are not sparse and use no discriminative information, (ii) the basis metrics are full-rank, thus expensive to learn, and (iii) a weight vector is learned explicitly for each training instance, which can result in a large number of parameters and prevents generalization to new instances (in practice, for a test point, they use the weight vector of its nearest neighbor in the training set). As observed by Ramanan and Baker (2011), the above methods make the implicit assumption that the metric tensor is locally constant (at the class, region or neighborhood level), while SCML-Local learns a smooth function that maps any instance to its specific metric. ISD (Zhan et al., 2009) is an attempt to learn the metrics for unlabeled points by propagation, but is limited to the transductive setting. Unlike the above discriminative approaches, GLML (Noh et al., 2010) learns a metric for each point independently in a generative way by minimizing the 1-NN expected error under some assumption for the class distributions."

Both algorithms use the same training triplets, generated by identifying 3 target neighbors (nearest neighbors with same label) and 10 imposters (nearest neighbors with different label) for each instance.

Furthermore, its training time is smaller than competing methods, especially for high-dimensional data. For instance, on the BBC dataset, SCML-Global trained in about 90 seconds, which is about 20x faster than LMNN and 35x faster than BoostML. Note also that SCML-Global is consistently more accurate than linear SVM, as shown in Appendix B.\nNumber of selected basis elements Like SCML-Global, recall that BoostML is based on combining rank-one elements (see Section 4). The main difference with SCML-Global is that our method is given a set of locally discriminative metrics and picks the relevant ones by learning sparse weights, while BoostML generates a new basis element at each iteration and adds it to the current combination. Table 4 reports the number of basis elements used in SCML-Global and BoostML solutions. Overall, SCML-Global uses fewer\nelements than BoostML (on two datasets, it uses more but this yields to significantly better performance). The results on USPS and BBC also suggest that the number of basis elements selected by SCML-Global seems to scale well with dimensionality. These nice properties come from its knowledge of the entire basis set and the sparsity-inducing regularizer. On the contrary, the number of elements (and therefore iterations) needed by BoostML to converge seems to scale poorly with dimensionality."

Indeed, mt-LMNN does not outperform st-LMNN significantly. On the other hand, mt-SCML performs better than its singletask counterpart and than all other compared methods by a significant margin, demonstrating its ability to leverage some commonalities between tasks that mt-LMNN is unable to capture. It is worth noting that the solution found by mt-SCML is based on only 273 basis elements on average (out of a total of 1,600), while st-SCML makes use of significantly more elements (347 elements per task on average). Basis elements selected by mt-SCML are evenly distributed across all tasks, which indicates that it is able to exploit meaningful information across tasks to get both more accurate and more compact metrics.

PLML does not perform well on small datasets (Vehicle and Vowel), presumably because there are not enough points to get a good estimation of the data manifold. GLML is fast but has rather poor performance on most datasets because its Gaussian assumption is restrictive and it learns the local metrics independently. Among discriminative methods, SCML-Local offers the best training time, especially for high-dimensional data (e.g. on BBC, it trained in about 8 minutes, which is about 5x faster than MMLMNN and 15x faster than PLML). Note that on this dataset, both MM-LMNN and PLML perform worse than SCML-Global due to severe overfitting, while SCML-Local avoids it by learning significantly fewer parameters. Finally, SCML-Local achieves accuracy results that are very competitive with those of a kernel SVM, as shown in Appendix B.\nVisualization of the learned metrics To provide a better understanding of why SCML-Local works well, we apply it to digits 1, 2, and 3 of USPS projected in 2D using t-SNE (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008),\nshown in Figure 2(a). We use 10 basis elements and D′ = 5. Figure 2(b) shows the training points colored by their learned metric (based on the projection of the weight vectors in 1D using PCA). We see that the local metrics vary smoothly and are thereby robust to outliers. Unlike MM-LMNN, points within a class are allowed to have different metrics: in particular, this is useful for points that are near the decision boundary. While smooth, the variation in the weights is thus driven by discriminative information, unlike PLML where they are only based on the smoothness assumption. Finally, Figure 2(c) shows that the metrics consistently generalize to test data.\nEffect of the basis set size Figure 3 shows the number of selected basis elements and test error rate for SCML-Global and SCML-Local as a function of the size of basis set on Segment (results were consistent on other datasets). The left pane shows that the number of selected elements increases sublinearly and eventually converges, while the right pane shows that test error may be further reduced by using a larger basis set without significant overfitting, as suggested by our generalization bound (Theorem 1). Figure 3 also shows that SCML-Local generally selects more basis elements than SCML-Global, but notice that it can outperform SCML-Global even when the basis set is very small."

      "text" : "We proposed to learn metrics as sparse combinations of rank-one basis elements. This framework unifies several paradigms in metric learning, including global, local and multi-task learning. Of particular interest is our local metric learning algorithm which can compute instance-specific metrics for both training and test points in a principled way. The soundness of our approach is supported theoretically by a generalization bound, and we showed in experimental studies that the proposed methods improve upon state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and scalability.\nAcknowledgements This research is partially supported by the IARPA via DoD/ARL contract # W911NF12-C-0012 and DARPA via contract # D11AP00278.

      "text" : "In this section, we give the details of the derivation of the generalization bounds for the global and multi-task learning formulations given in Section 3.\nA.1 Preliminaries\nWe start by introducing some notation. We are given a training sample S = {zi = (xi, yi)}ni=1 drawn i.i.d. from a distribution P over the labeled space Z = X × Y . We assume that ‖x‖ ≤ R (for some convenient norm), ∀x ∈ X . We call a triplet (z, z′, z′′) admissible if y = y′ 6= y′′. Let CS be the set of all admissible triplets built from instances in S.8\n8When the training triplets consist of only a subset of all admissible triplets (which is often the case in practice), a relaxed version of the robustness property can be used to derive similar results (Bellet and Habrard, 2012). For simplicity, we focus here on the case when all admissible triplets are used.\nLet L(h,z, z′, z′′) be the loss suffered by some hypothesis h on triplet (z, z′, z′′), with the convention that L returns 0 for non-admissible triplets. We assume L to be uniformly upper-bounded by a constant U . The empirical lossRCSemp(h) of h on CS is defined as\nRCSemp(h) = 1 |CS | ∑\n(z,z′,z′′)∈CS\nL(h, z, z′, z′′),\nand its expected lossR(h) over distribution P as\nR(h) = Ez,z′,z′′∼PL(h, z, z′, z′′).\nOur goal is to bound the deviation betweenR(ACS ) andRCSemp(ACS ), whereACS is the hypothesis learned by algorithm A on CS .\nA.2 Algorithmic Robustness\nTo derive our generalization bounds, we use the recent framework of algorithmic robustness (Xu and Mannor, 2012), in particular its adaptation to pairwise and tripletwise loss functions used in metric learning (Bellet and Habrard, 2012). For the reader’s convenience, we briefly review these main results below.\nAlgorithmic robustness is the ability of an algorithm to perform “similarly” on a training example and on a test example that are “close”. The proximity of points is based on a partitioning of the space Z: two examples are close to each other if they lie in the same region. The partition is based on the notion of covering number (Kolmogorov and Tikhomirov, 1961).\nDefinition 1 (Covering number). For a metric space (S, ρ) and V ⊂ S, we say that V̂ ⊂ V is a γ-cover of V if ∀t ∈ V , ∃t̂ ∈ V̂ such that ρ(t, t̂) ≤ γ. The γ-covering number of V is\nN (γ,V, ρ) = min { |V̂| : V̂ is a γ-cover of V } .\nIn particular, when X is compact, N (γ,X , ρ) is finite, leading to a finite cover. Then, Z can be partitioned into |Y|N (γ,X , ρ) subsets such that if two examples z = (x, y) and z′ = (x′, y′) belong to the same subset, then y = y′ and ρ(x,x′) ≤ γ. The definition of robustness for tripletwise loss functions (adapted from Xu and Mannor, 2012) is as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Robustness for metric learning (Bellet and Habrard, 2012)). An algorithmA is (N, (·)) robust for N ∈ N and (·) : (Z × Z)n → R if Z can be partitioned into N disjoints sets, denoted by {Qi}Ni=1, such that the following holds for all S ∈ Zn: ∀(z1, z2, z3) ∈ CS ,∀z, z′, z′′ ∈ Z, ∀i, j ∈ [N ] : if z1, z ∈ Qi, z2, z′ ∈ Qj , z3, z′′ ∈ Qk then\n|L(ACS , z1, z2, z3)− L(ACS , z, z ′, z′′)| ≤ (CS),\nwhere ACS is the hypothesis learned by A on CS .\nN and (·) quantify the robustness of the algorithm and depend on the training sample. Again adapting the result from (Xu and Mannor, 2012), (Bellet and Habrard, 2012) showed that a metric learning algorithm that satisfies Definition 2 has the following generalization guarantees.\nTheorem 2. If a learning algorithmA is (N, (·))-robust and the training sample consists of the triplets CS obtained from a sample S generated by n i.i.d. draws from P , then for any δ > 0, with probability at least 1− δ we have:\n|R(ACS )−R CS emp(ACS )| ≤ (CS) + 3U\n√ N ln 2 + ln 1δ\n0.5n .\nAs shown in (Bellet and Habrard, 2012), establishing the robustness of an algorithm is easier using the following theorem, which basically says that if a metric learning algorithm has approximately the same loss for triplets that are close to each other, then it is robust.\nTheorem 3. Fix γ > 0 and a metric ρ ofZ . Suppose that ∀z1, z2, z3, z, z′, z′′ : (z1, z2, z3) ∈ CS , ρ(z1, z) ≤ γ, ρ(z2, z ′) ≤ γ, ρ(z3, z′′) ≤ γ, A satisfies\n|L(ACS , z1, z2, z3)− L(ACS , z, z ′, z′′)| ≤ (CS),\nand N (γ/2,Z, ρ) <∞. Then the algorithm A is (N (γ/2,Z, ρ), (CS))-robust.\nWe now have all the tools we need to prove the results of interest.\nA.3 Generalization Bounds for SCML\nA.3.1 Bound for SCML-Global\nWe first focus on SCML-Global where the loss function is defined as follows:\nL(w, z, z′, z′′) = [ 1 + dw(x,x ′)− dw(x,x′′) ] + .\nWe obtain a generalization bound by showing that SCML-Global satisfies Definition 2 using Theorem 3. To establish the result, we need a bound on the `2 norm of the basis elements. Since they are obtained by eigenvalue decomposition, their norm is equal to (and thus bounded by) 1.\nLet w∗ be the optimal solution to SCML-Global. By optimality of w∗ we have:\nL(w∗, z, z′, z′′) + β‖w∗‖1 ≤ L(0, z, z′, z′′) + β‖0‖1 = 1,\nthus we get ‖w∗‖1 ≤ 1/β. Let M∗ = ∑K i=1w ∗ i bib T i be the learned metric. Then using Holder’s inequality and the bound on w∗ and the b’s:\n‖M∗‖1 = ∥∥∥∥∥ K∑ i=1 w∗i bib T i ∥∥∥∥∥ 1 = ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i:wi 6=0 w∗i bib T i ∥∥∥∥∥∥ 1 ≤ ‖w∗‖1 ∑ i:wi 6=0 ‖bi‖∞‖bi‖∞ ≤ K∗/β,\nwhere K∗ ≤ K is the number of nonzero entries in w∗. Using Definition 1, we can partition Z into |Y|N (γ,X , ρ) subsets such that if two examples z = (x, y) and z′ = (x′, y′) belong to the same subset, then y = y′ and ρ(x,x′) ≤ γ. Now, for z1, z2, z3, z′1, z′2, z′3 ∈ Z, if y1 = y′1, ‖x1−x′1‖1 ≤ γ, y2 = y′2, ‖x2−x′2‖1 ≤ γ, y3 = y′3, ‖x3−x′3‖1 ≤ γ, then (z1, z2, z3) and (z′1, z ′ 2, z ′ 3) are either both admissible or both non-admissible triplets.\nIn the non-admissible case, by definition their respective loss is 0 and so is the deviation between the losses. In the admissible case we have:∣∣∣[1 + dw∗(x1,x2)− dw∗(x1,x3)]+ − [1 + dw∗(x′1,x′2)− dw∗(x′1,x′3)]+∣∣∣ ≤ |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x1 − x2)− (x1 − x3)TM∗(x1 − x3) + (x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x′1 − x′3)− (x′1 − x′2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)| = |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x1 − x2)− (x1 − x2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2) + (x1 − x2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)− (x′1 − x′2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)\n+ (x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x′1 − x′3)− (x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x1 − x3) + (x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x1 − x3)− (x1 − x3)TM∗(x1 − x3)| = |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x1 − x2 − (x′1 − x′2)) + (x1 − x2 − (x′1 − x′2))TM∗(x′1 − x′2) + (x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x′1 − x′3 − (x1 − x3)) + (x′1 − x′3 − (x1 − x3))TM∗(x1 − x3)| ≤ |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x1 − x′1)|+ |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x′2 − x2)|+ |(x1 − x′1)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)|\n+ |(x′2 − x2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)|+ |(x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x′1 − x1)|+ |(x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x3 − x′3)| + |(x′1 − x1)TM∗(x1 − x3)|+ |(x3 − x′3)TM∗(x1 − x3)|\n≤ ‖x1 − x2‖∞‖M∗‖1‖x1 − x′1‖1 + ‖x1 − x2‖∞‖M∗‖1‖x′2 − x2‖1 + ‖x1 − x′1‖1‖M∗‖1‖x′1 − x′2‖∞ + ‖x′2 − x2‖1‖M∗‖1‖x′1 − x′2‖∞ + ‖x′1 − x′3‖∞‖M∗‖1‖x′1 − x1‖1 + ‖x′1 − x′3‖∞‖M∗‖1‖x3 − x′3‖1 + ‖x′1 − x1‖1‖M∗‖1‖x1 − x3‖∞ + ‖x3 − x′3‖1‖M∗‖1‖x1 − x3‖∞ ≤ 16γRK ∗\nβ ,\nby using the property that the hinge loss is 1-Lipschitz, Holder’s inequality and bounds on the involved quantities. Thus SCML-Global is (|Y |N (γ,X, ‖·‖1), 16γRK ∗\nβ )-robust and the generalization bound follows.\nA.3.2 Bound for mt-SCML\nIn the multi-task setting, we are given a training sample St = {zi = (xti, yti)} nt i=1. Let CSt be the set of all admissible triplets built from instances in St. Let W ∗ be the optimal solution to mt-SCML. Using the same arguments as for SCML-Global, by\noptimality of W ∗ we have ‖W ∗‖2,1 ≤ 1/β. Let M∗t = ∑K i=1W ∗ tibib T i be the learned metric for task t and W ∗t be the weight vector for task t, corresponding to the t-th row of W ∗. Then using the fact that ‖W ∗t ‖2,1 ≤ ‖W ∗‖2,1 and ‖b‖2,1 = ‖b‖2, we have:\n‖M∗t ‖2,1 = ∥∥∥∥∥ K∑ i=1 W ∗tibib T i ∥∥∥∥∥ 2,1 = ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i:W ∗ti 6=0 W ∗tibib T i ∥∥∥∥∥∥ 2,1 ≤ ‖W ∗t ‖2,1 ∑ i:W ∗ti 6=0 ‖bi‖2,1‖bi‖2,1 ≤ K∗t /β,\nwhere K∗t ≤ K is the number of nonzero entries in W ∗t . From this we can derive a generalization bound for each task using arguments similar to the global case, using a partition specific to each task defined with respect to ‖ · ‖2. Without loss of generality, we focus on task t and only explicitly write the last derivations as the beginning is the same as above:∣∣[1 + dw∗(x1,x2)− dw∗(x1,x3)]+ − [1 + dw∗(x′1,x′2)− dw∗(x′1,x′3)]+∣∣ ≤ |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x1 − x′1)|+ |(x1 − x2)TM∗(x′2 − x2)|+ |(x1 − x′1)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)|\n+ |(x′2 − x2)TM∗(x′1 − x′2)|+ |(x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x′1 − x1)|+ |(x′1 − x′3)TM∗(x3 − x′3)| + |(x′1 − x1)TM∗(x1 − x3)|+ |(x3 − x′3)TM∗(x1 − x3)|\n≤ ‖x1 − x2‖2‖M∗‖F‖x1 − x′1‖2 + ‖x1 − x2‖2‖M∗‖F‖x′2 − x2‖2 + ‖x1 − x′1‖2‖M∗‖F‖x′1 − x′2‖2 + ‖x′2 − x2‖2‖M∗‖F‖x′1 − x′2‖2 + ‖x′1 − x′3‖2‖M∗‖F‖x′1 − x1‖2 + ‖x′1 − x′3‖2‖M∗‖F‖x3 − x′3‖2 + ‖x′1 − x2‖2‖M∗‖F‖x1 − x3‖2 + ‖x3 − x′3‖2‖M∗‖F‖x1 − x3‖2 ≤ 16γRK ∗ t\nβ ,\nwhere we used the same arguments as above and the inequality ‖M∗‖F ≤ ‖M∗‖2,1. Thus mt-SCML is (|Y |N (γ,X, ‖ · ‖2), 16γRK ∗ t\nβ )-robust and the bound for task t follows. Note that the number of training examples in the bound is only that from task t, i.e., n = nt.\nA.3.3 Comments on SCML-Local\nIt would be interesting to be able to derive a similar bound for SCML-Local. Unfortunately, as it is nonconvex, we cannot assume optimality of the solution. If a similar formulation can be made convex, the same proof technique should apply: even though each instance has its own metric, it essentially depends on the instance itself (whose norm is bounded) and on the learned parameters shared across metrics (which could be bounded using optimality of the solution). Deriving such a convex formulation and the corresponding generalization bound is left as future work."

      "text" : "In this section, we compare SCML-Global and SCML-Local to Support Vector Machines (SVM) using a linear and a RBF kernel. We used the software LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) and tuned the parameter C as well as the bandwidth for the RBF kernel on the validation set. Table 7 shows misclassification rates averaged over 20 random splits, along with standard error and the average rank of each method across all datasets. First, we can see that SCML-Global consistently performs better than linear SVM. Second, SCMLLocal is competitive with kernel SVM. These results show that a simple k-nearest neighbor strategy with a good metric can be competitive (and even outperform) SVM classifiers."

This flexible framework allows us to naturally derive formulations for global, multi-task and local metric learning. The resulting algorithms have several advantages over existing methods in the literature: a much smaller number of parameters to be estimated and a principled way to generalize learned metrics to new testing data points. To analyze the approach theoretically, we derive a generalization bound that justifies the sparse combination. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithms on several datasets against state-of-the-art metric learning methods. The results are consistent with our theoretical findings and demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of classification performance and scalability.",
