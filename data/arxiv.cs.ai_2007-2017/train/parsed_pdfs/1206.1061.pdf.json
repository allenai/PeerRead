      "text" : "Learning how to use new technological system is mainly an exploratory activity[2]. Exploring learning has shown to improve the abilities constructing to successful error handling and discovering, and eventually constructing, correct knowledge. But exploratory activity frequently leads to experience uninterested states does not reach the interested state goal. Users need assistance not only to avoid errors, but also to understand how the system interprets their commands [8, 9, 12]. In order to respond to a query, an executive assistant might know very precisely the goal the user has in mind [14], which means an object in a given state (the properties of the object being transformed). Moreover, even when goals are fairly well defined, it is often necessary to think about superordinate goals. The fuzzy set method has been used to develop the \"on-line instructions\" mechanisms of an Intelligent Assistance System. It can be seen as a supervisor of task execution that has the \"ideal user's knowledge\" of (i) prerequisites of procedures, (ii) subGoals structure[3]. And (iii) the semantic network of the elements of the device where applied procedures are used as properties, as well as (iv) the knowledge of perceptible and imperceptible effects of user's actions[4]. With an interactive dialogue with a user, the Assistance System tries to match items provided by users in natural language with the knowledge included in the ideal user's semantic network [3]."

      "text" : "The example of the technical system we consider here is Word Processor software (figure1), with Objects such as \"chain-of-characters\", and procedures such as \"cut\" or \"copy\". For a novice user of the software, the list of standard denominations is not obvious and he often would like to ask an expert operator about how to execute an action such as \"how to rub letters\" [4]. The underlying psychological hypothesis is that Goals are Object properties, and are generators of Object categories. Goals and procedures define the function of Objects and the way to use them. As functional properties of Objects, they enter into the construction of semantic networks in the same way as structural properties. We define a procedure as a sequence of operations whose execution serves to reach a Goal, and where the elements of the sequence are either primitive actions or subGoals which themselves call for associated procedures."

      "text" : "In mathematical treatment of the linguistic variable aiming to process some fuzzy deductions by computers, a linguistic variable definition imposes itself. In this context, we assign to every value of the linguistic variable a membership functions μ, the value varies between 0 and 1. While holding amount of the classification in a certain number of fuzzy sets, this represents the fuzzyfication process. For the representation of the different concepts of our system, we propose to consider the set of system's Goals (respectively Objects) as a set of linguistic variables."

      "text" : "So far, we have introduced a fine subdivision, with four or five values for the linguistic variable that we manipulate forming thus as many fuzzy sets as it is shown in Fig. 1. We have also defined five levels of interpretation because actually, it appears that, for more than five levels, we have a problem of natural discrimination between the different levels and less than five is insufficient to have a good discrimination. Our objective is to have a cleaner idea of the interpretation of a user's Goal with regard to the fuzzy knowledge basis.\nWe can distinguish, therefore, five possible values for a given linguistic variable and therefore five membership functions corresponding to the sets of values in table 1. These values are determined to the departure by the expert, and adjusted progressively by the system when a user’s request has been identified with success."

We can distinguish five values \"not_true\", \"little_true\", \"half_true\", \"rather_true\" and \"quite_true\" to which corresponds five fuzzy sets (Fig. 1). So CutWithKey of 0.25 belongs with a membership factor μ=0.7 to the \"half_true\" set and with μ=0.3 to the \"quite_true\" set. Explicitly, we can write μhalf_true(CutWithKey=0.25)=0.7 and μquite_true(CutWithKey=0.25)=0.3. We consider the membership function of the verb to Gum with regard to the Expert Goal CutWithKey. The Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 represent the result of the adjustement process. So CutWithKey of 0.75 belongs with a membership factor μ=0.7 to the \"half_true\" set and with μ=0.3 to the\nGumCutWithMenu = {(not_true, [0,0,0.2,0.4]), (half_true, [0.2,0.4,0.4,0.6]), (quite_true, [0.6,0.7,1,1]).

With the learning of new words in natural language as the interpretation which was produced in agreement with the user, the system improves its representation scheme at each experiment with a new user and, in addition, takes advantage of previous discussions with users. Then, to make easy the diagnosis of the user’s fuzzy queries, we suggest in the next section to deel with the similarity degree [1, 17, 18] between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects."

This Semantic Networks is used to describe the knowledge of an \"ideal\" expert while fuzzy sets are used both to describe the approximate and uncertain knowledge of novice users who intervene to match fuzzy labels of a query with categories from an \"ideal\" expert. The technical system we consider is a word processor software, with Objects such as “Word” and Goals such as “Cut” or “Copy”. We suggest to consider the set of the system's Goals as a set of linguistic variables to which corresponds a set of possible linguistic values based on the fuzzy set. We consider, therefore, a set of interpretation’s levels for these possible values to which corresponds a set of membership functions. We also propose a method to measure the similarity degree between different fuzzy linguistic variables for the partition of the semantic network in class of similar objects to make easy the diagnosis of the user’s fuzzy queries.",
