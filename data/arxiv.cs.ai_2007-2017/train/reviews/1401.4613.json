In this paper we show that the power of using k-consistency techniques on a constraint satisfaction problem is precisely captured by using a particular inference rule, which we call negative-hyper-resolution, on the standard direct encoding of the problem into Boolean clauses. We also show that current clause-learning SAT-solvers will discover in expected polynomial time any inconsistency that can be deduced from a given set of clauses using negative-hyper-resolvents of a fixed size. We combine these two results to show that, without being explicitly designed to do so, current clause-learning SAT-solvers efficiently simulate k-consistency techniques, for all fixed values of k. We then give some experimental results to show that this feature allows clause-learning SAT-solvers to efficiently solve certain families of constraint problems which are challenging for conventional constraint-programming solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:39:00 GMT  (441kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4613v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["peter jeavons", "justyna petke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4613"}
