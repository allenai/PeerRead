Circuit synthesis, optimization, and verification problems can be solved by transforming original problems to SAT problems. However, the SAT problem is known as an NP-complete problem, which means there is no efficient method to solve SAT problems. Therefore, the design of an efficient SAT solver to enhance the performance is always desired. In this paper, we proposed a hardware acceleration method for Boolean SAT problems. By surveying the properties of SAT problems and the decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, a special class of error-correcting codes (ECCs), we discover that both of them are constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The belief propagation algorithm (BPA) has been successfully applied to the decoding of LDPC, and the corresponding decoder hardware designs are extensively studied. Therefore, we proposed a belief propagation based algorithm to solve SAT problems. With this algorithm, the SAT solver can be accelerated by hardware. A software simulator is implemented to verify the proposed algorithm and the performance improvement is estimated. Our experiment results show that time complexity does not increase with the size of SAT problems and the proposed method can achieve at least 30× speedup compared to MiniSat.\nKeywords SAT, Boolean Satisfiability, Belief Propagation Algorithm."

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a class of problems that establishes if there exist an assignment to variables of a Boolean formula that evaluates it to true [1]. This Boolean formula is usually in the conjunctive normal form (CNF), which is an expression of a conjunction (AND, ⋀) of clauses. Each clause is a disjunction (OR, ⋁) of literals, and each literal is either a variable or its negation (NOT, ¬ ). SAT has an extensive application domain. In logic design, synthesis, optimization and verification, many problems, such as placement and route, test pattern generation, and equivalence checking, and model checking, etc., can be expressed as variables whose values are in the set {\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC52} or {1,0}.\nThe SAT problem is the first known NP-complete decision problem [2], which means that there is no efficient algorithm to solve SAT problems. Although theoretically, finding the set of assignment can be achieved by exhaustively trying all the possible assignments, this method becomes infeasible quickly as the number of literals and clauses increases. The set of algorithms that can solve SAT problems are called SAT solvers. However, due to the NP-complete nature of SAT, how to solve SAT problems within a reasonable time becomes an important issue. Much research has been conducted to improve the efficiency of SAT\nsolvers, but no algorithm so far can efficiently solve all SAT instances.\nThe goal of this paper is using hardware to accelerate SAT solvers. The approaches to solve the SAT problem have divided into software solvers, which solving the problem using computer simulation, and hardware solver, to implement Verilog code running on FPGA or virtual machine [7][10][11]. For hardware SAT solver, the main two categories are instance-specific (instance dependence) and application-specific. In this work, we try to implement an instance-specific model, which is more resource efficient to accommodate on a single FPGA.\nTo satisfy a CNF, i.e. to find a set of value that makes the CNF=1, each clause must be 1 too. Therefore, each clause represents a constraint that must be satisfied simultaneously. A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) consists of three components, \uD835\uDC4B, \uD835\uDC37, and \uD835\uDC36 [3]:\n1. \uD835\uDC4B is a set of variables, {\uD835\uDC4B1, \uD835\uDC4B2, … , \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC5B }.\n2. \uD835\uDC37 is a set of domains, {\uD835\uDC371, \uD835\uDC372, … , \uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC5B } , one for each variable.\n3. \uD835\uDC36 is a set of constraints that specify allowable combinations of values.\nEach domain \uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC56 consists of a set of allowable values, {\uD835\uDC631, \uD835\uDC632, … , \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC58 } for variable \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56. Each constrain \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC56 consists of a pair 〈\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59〉, where \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC52 is a tuple of variables that participate in the constrain and \uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 is the relation that defines the values that those variables can take on. A problem is solved when each variable has a value that satisfies all constraints on the variable.\nFrom the definition of the CSP, it can be found that Boolean SAT is a special case of the CSP, where the set of domains is {\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC52} or {1,0} and the constraints are defined by a set of clauses that must be satisfied simultaneously.\nError correction codes (ECC’s) provide one of the most costeffective ways to achieve noise protection. By applying the ECC to data, errors can be corrected or detected. An (n, k) code maps a binary k-tuple called a message block to a binary n-tuple called a codeword block. Usually, message and codeword blocks are represented in vector forms so the mapping is defined by a set of matrix multiplications. The decoding of a special class of ECC, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes [4], is a constraint satisfaction problem. The parity-check equations are specially designed equations that are equal to zero if all the inputs are correct.\nThe goal of decoding LDPC codes is to find a set of input assignments such that all the parity-check equations are equal to 0. Therefore, the decoding of LDPC codes is actually a CSP. Each symbol of the codeword is a variable; each parity check\ncorresponds to a constraint in CSP. Besides, the domain of the variables is limited to {\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC52, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC52} or {1,0} in LDPC codes. Therefore, the decoding of LDPC codes can be modeled as a SAT problem.\nIn the decoding of LDPC codes, the procedure can be illustrated by a bipartite graph which contains two types of nodes: variable nodes and parity-check nodes, and use iterative belief propagation decoding method to find solutions [8][9]. Since both the decoding of LDPC codes and SAT solvers are CSPs, and the decoding of LDPC codes can be accomplished by specific designed hardware. Here comes the question: can we extend the LDPC algorithm, belief propagation algorithm (BPA), to solve SAT problems so that a SAT solver can be speeded up by hardware? In this paper, we show that BPA can also be applied to SAT solvers since both of them solve CSPs. It is also possible a hardware circuit using similar architecture can also be used to accelerate SAT solvers. Therefore we propose a method to utilize a hardware based on LDPC decoder to improve the speed to SAT solvers."

      "heading" : "2. LOW-DENSITY PARITY CHECK CODE",
      "text" : "Originally proposed in 1962 by Robert Gallager [4] and rediscovered by David MacKay in 1996 [6], LDPC codes with iterative decoding algorithms have performance closely approaching Shannon channel capacity. LDPC codes went unnoticed until the 1990s because the hardware could not support effective decoder implementations. However with MacKay’s research and the development of semiconductor technology, the hardware implementation of LDPC codes became feasible.\nA LDPC code is a linear block code for which the parity check matrix of interest has a low density of ones. A LDPC code can be represented by matrices. Assume that C is the codeword set of a (n, k) binary linear block code. If a k × n matrix G is its generation matrix, then \uD835\uDC36 = {\uD835⃑\uDC65 ∙ \uD835\uDC3A|\uD835⃑\uDC65\uD835\uDF16{0,1}\uD835\uDC58} for any length-k\nmessage \uD835⃑\uDC65. An m × n matrix H is its parity check matrix, if \uD835\uDC36 = {\uD835\uDC50|\uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDF16{0,1}\uD835\uDC5B, \uD835\uDC50 ∙ \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47 = 0 } where \uD835\uDC50 is a codeword of C. In other words, an LDPC code is designed to satisfy that for every codeword \uD835\uDC50 ∈ \uD835\uDC36, this equation \uD835\uDC50 ∙ \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47 = 0 always holds.\nLDPC codes can also be represented by using graphs. A parity-check matrix H can be associated with a graph called bipartite graph. This graph contains two set of nodes: variable nodes and check nodes (v-nodes and c-nodes). The rule for constructing the graph is that a c-node i is connected to a v-node j whenever element hij in H is a 1. For example, let the parity-check matrix H be a 3×4 matrix\n\uD835\uDC3B = [ 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ]\nThe corresponding bipartite graph is shown in Figure 1. There are 4 v-nodes and 3 c-nodes in this example.\nBesides, a cycle of length l in a bipartite graph is a path comprised of l edges from a node back to the same node. For example the bipartite Graph of Fig. 1 has a cycle of length 6. Short cycles are usually considered bad in graphs used for iterative decoding based on “message passing;” they increase the dependence of information being received at each node during message passing which may lead to latch-up problems. LDPC codes depend on a message passing decoding algorithm called belief propagation algorithm (BPA) or sum-product algorithm (SPA). The BPA is an efficient decoding algorithm which iteratively decodes LDPC code based on belief propagation. BPA decodes data with the probability computation of received signals based on the characteristic of the channel. The input bit probabilities are called the a priori probabilities for the received bits because they were known in advance before running the LDPC decoder. Besides, two sets of probabilities computation are handled in the decoder. One is related to the decoding criterion which determines the value of a received bit from the value of a received signal. The sets of probabilities are referred to as posterior probabilities.\nThe other probability is related to the satisfaction of each check sum given the received signal on each bit. BPA decoding can decode the data by iterative update in these two sets of probabilities until the satisfaction of the received bits is determined by the first sets of probabilities in the parity-check equations. The goal of the decoder is to find the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) for each codeword bit. In other words, the aim of SPA is to maximize the probability that all parity-check constraints are satisfied for each codeword bit.\nFigure 2 illustrate the basic concept of the BPA. Figure 2(a) is a part of a bipartite graph; it only shows nodes and edges that connected to a parity-check c1. Here the relation between c1 and v1,\nv2, and v3 is: \uD835\uDC501 = \uD835\uDC631 \uD835\uDC632 \uD835\uDC633 where is XOR. To satisfy this parity-check, v1, v2, and v3 must be all 0’s or only two of them are 1’s. The BPA handles two sets of probabilities. The first set is related to the decoding criterion. These quantities are defined and iterative computed in the BPA:\n(1) \uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC56,\uD835\uDC57(\uD835\uDC58) : The probability \uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC56 = 1 given \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 = \uD835\uDC58 and\nprobabilities of other variables, \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57’s.\n(2) \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC57,\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC58) : The probability \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 = \uD835\uDC58 when all parity checks\ninvolving \uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC57 except \uD835\uDC50\uD835\uDC56 are satisfied.\nFor example, \uD835\uDC5F1,1(1) is the probability of \uD835\uDC501 =1 given the\ninformation \uD835\uDC5E2,1 and \uD835\uDC5E2,1 . Note that since \uD835\uDC501 = \uD835\uDC631 \uD835\uDC632 \uD835\uDC633 if \uD835\uDC5E2,1 and \uD835\uDC5E2,1 are high, i.e. the probability that \uD835\uDC632 and \uD835\uDC633 are 1’s\nare high, the probability that \uD835\uDC631 = 0 must be high to satisfy \uD835\uDC501 = 0.\nOn the other hand, for the v-node, Figure 2(b) is a partial graph that shows all the parity-check nodes that use v2. The vnode v2 receives the information of probabilities that satisfy all the parity-checks that v2 involves in and then uses this information to update its probability. For example, in Figure 2(b) \uD835\uDC632 passes its probability to \uD835\uDC501 by using the information form \uD835\uDC501 and \uD835\uDC503.\nAnother set of probability that is related to the decoding criterion is also calculated. It is denoted as \uD835\uDC44\uD835\uDC57 , representing the probability that all checks involving jth bit are satisfied. This probability is also called pseudo-posterior probability.\nThere are five steps in the BPA shown in Figure 3 [12]. The original algorithm is designed for a communication system assuming signals are modulated in binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) where logic 1 is modulated as -1 voltage and logic 0 is 1 voltage. The noise is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The general form of the BPA is as follows:"

The blue histogram indicates the average iteration of the solved instances. The line chart represents the average speedup compared with the execution time of MiniSat SAT solver. The average iteration number of all the solved instance doesn’t show any trend of growth as the growth of the problem size, which imply the constant timing complexity regardless of the scale of the SAT problem.\nThe line chart comes from the equation (1). The speedup grows in exponential, because the execution time of MiniSat grows in exponential. The spike on uf200-860 is caused by the large standard deviation when the sample number is small. This chart indicates the main advantage of adopting the BPA on SAT: the iteration of propagation is independent to the size of the SAT problem. Also, as mentioned above, each computation of r and q only depends on the previous iteration result of q and r, which can be implemented in parallel easily with a buffer storing its previous value. Moreover, the sparse literal-clause matrix release the competing of the shared memory issue, which is applicable to implement on both FPGA, GPU, or even ASIC devices to reduce the synthesis timing overhead."

The BPA-SAT is based on the belief propagation algorithm (BPA) that is used in the decoding of a class of error-correcting codes, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Since BPA can be implemented with hardware, the BPA-SAT solver can be accelerated by hardware.

Therefore, the speed solver does not degrade dramatically as the size of the CNF increases. The main issue, completeness, of this algorithm is also investigated. The\ncompleteness decreases significantly as the size of the CNF increases. The experimental results and our estimation show that for the instants that the BPA-SAT can solve, BPA-SAT can achieve 30× to 44k× speedup compared to a state-of-art SAT solver, MiniSat."

Circuit synthesis, optimization, and verification problems can be solved by transforming original problems to SAT problems. However, the SAT problem is known as an NP-complete problem, which means there is no efficient method to solve SAT problems. Therefore, the design of an efficient SAT solver to enhance the performance is always desired. In this paper, we proposed a hardware acceleration method for Boolean SAT problems. By surveying the properties of SAT problems and the decoding of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes, a special class of error-correcting codes (ECCs), we discover that both of them are constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). The belief propagation algorithm (BPA) has been successfully applied to the decoding of LDPC, and the corresponding decoder hardware designs are extensively studied. Therefore, we proposed a belief propagation based algorithm to solve SAT problems. With this algorithm, the SAT solver can be accelerated by hardware. A software simulator is implemented to verify the proposed algorithm and the performance improvement is estimated. Our experiment results show that time complexity does not increase with the size of SAT problems and the proposed method can achieve at least 30× speedup compared to MiniSat.",
