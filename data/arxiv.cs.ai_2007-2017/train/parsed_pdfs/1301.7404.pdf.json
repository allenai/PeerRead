      "text" : "Distributed knowledge based applications in open domain rely on common sense infor mation which is bound to be uncertain and incomplete. To draw the useful conclusions from ambiguous data, one must address un certainties and conflicts incurred in a holis tic view. No integrated frameworks are vi able without an in-depth analysis of con flicts incurred by uncertainties. In this pa per, we give such an analysis and based on the result, propose an integrated framework. Our framework extends definite argumenta tion theory to model uncertainty. It sup ports three views over conflicting and uncer tain knowledge. Thus, knowledge engineers can draw different conclusions depending on the application context (i.e. view). We also give an illustrative example on strategical de cision support to show the practical useful ness of our framework.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nExpert systems rely on common sense knowledge which is conflicting and uncertain. Conflicts and un certainties are not orthogonal but intertwined. Uncer tainties usually lead to conflicts and conflicts usually result in uncertainties. Thus, any practical expert sys tems must address both aspects.\nLogic-based information reasoning is an interesting do main where conflicts, in the form of partial and oppos ing arguments, are unavoidable. With an eye on this particular domain, we propose a framework to capture the notion of conflict and resolve it under uncertain ties.\nThe most widely used methodology for tackling con flicts and uncertainties are model-based approaches\nlike classical logic. Owing to their declarative nature, they have difficulties in discerning different kinds of conflicts. On the other hand, argumentation, a reviv ing integrated approach, gives promising results ad dressing this issue. It studies not only models of knowl edge bases but also their structures, derivations and conflicts. Unifying these studies can lead to a deeper understanding of uncertain and conflicting knowledge bases.\nJohn Pollock pioneered the research of defeasible argu mentation (Pollock, 1990) but he only concentrated on probability analysis of the topic. P. M. Dung (Dung, 1995b) and Robert Kowalski (Kowalski and Toni, 1996) investigated how argumentation subsume other non-monotonic logics and logic programming frame works with minimalistic settings. Gerard Vreeswijk (Vreeswijk, 1997) employed argumentation to model multi-agent systems in a completely abstract way. Henry Prakken shed light on argumentation for prag matic legal applications with his extended logic pro gramming framework. Bart Verheij (Verheij, 1996) unified all contemporary argumentation within his two frameworks. Our framework differs from these re searches in that we concentrate on conflicts and un certainties in a distributed setting.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sec tion 2, we describe our approach of modeling uncer tainties in argumentation and the conflicts that may pertain to such a setting. After introducing various definitions in Section 3, Section 4 and 5 outline the conflicts and possible resolution methods, respectively. We proceed to semantical analysis in Section 6 and dialectical analysis of proof-theory in Section 7. In Section 8, we describe how our framework relates to existing ones. In Section 9, a typical application of our framework is outlined. In the conclusion, Section 10, we discuss shortcomings of our framework and propose future work.\nResolving Conflicting Arguments under Uncertainties 415\n2 MODELING UNCERTAINTIES IN ARGUMENTATION\n2.1 Background\nUncertainty takes many forms. In many application domains, quantitative measures of uncertainty are dif ficult to obtain (Fox et al., ; Paul Krause and Fox, 1995), e.g. logic based information retrieval, rule based analysis, etc. In this paper, we focus on qualitative aspects of uncertainty. Undoubtedly, logic is one of the most powerful qualitative approaches. In classi cal model-based analysis of logic, entailment relation is declarative. Inference structure is not important as long as a fact can be derived. This is clearly undesir able for uncertainty reasoning. To draw useful conclu sions from a set of potentially conflicting and uncertain knowledge, we must know the structural aspect of in ferencing. We must know in what way conclusions are drawn and at which step conflicts are introduced.\nArgumentation is a variant of logic which can attack conflicts from their structures. Briefly, it was revived by Toulmin's book (Toulmin, 1958). Since then, many potential applications of the theory in nonmonotonic reasoning have been suggested (Lin, 1993; Lin and Shoham, ). The methodology of argumentation shows great similarity to the logic programming paradigm. As a result, various attempts (Dung, 1995a; Dung, 1995b; Prakken and Sartor, 1997) have been made on blending the practical usefulness of logic programming and the philosophical insight of argumentation.\nIn this paper, we show that argumentation is also applicable and, in fact, well-suited to the problem of uncertainty reasoning. Inspired by the work of Dung (Dung, 1995b) and Prakken (Prakken and Sar tor, 1997) , our framework is based on logic pro gramming. We represent knowledge with Extended Disjunctive Logic Program (EDLP)(Gelfond and Lif schitz, 1991) which is an extension of their frame work. We introduce disjunctive in the head of a clause for representing uncertain information. For example, {r1 : dog_bark -t stranger V arson} means \"a dog barks if either it sees a stranger or an arson\".\n2.2 Our Framework\nOur argumentation framework assumes a set of distributed knowledge based systems (KESs) (or agents). Conflicts are divided into two levels, namely\n1. Intra-KBS-conflicts - conflicts within one K B S\n2. Inter-KBS-conflicts - conflicts between K B Ss\nThe network of KBSs are managed by parties with different interests, such as different departments in a university. Knowledge in the KBSs overlap with each other either entirely or partially. This overlapping will most likely contain deviant views to the same knowl edge. For example, in the government organization of a country, the industrial development council is usually pessimistic to possible outcome of raising interest-rate whereas the banking authority council usually bears an opposite view, viz:\n• Industry : raising-interest-rate may lead to pressure-on-indus try\n• Banking raising-interest-rate may lead to pressure-on-industry or stimulate-financial related-sectors\nTo be general, one would like to keep multiple per spectives of the two views and apply them according to context.\nThe problem of reasoning in a distributed setting is then not to change either KBSs as other parts of them rely on their own views. The objective is therefore to recognize differences between different views j opinions yet still enables knowledge engineers to draw useful conclusions out of them. The discrepancies between distributed KBSs may lead to non-logical contradic tion, and this is very difficult to model simply by clas sical logic.\n3 DEFINITION\nFormally, our argumentation framework is defined, in a top-down fashion, as follows: If a literall is an atom a then lis ...,a. If l is ...,a then lis a. An argumentation system AS is a binary-tuple < Ags, Pg > where Ags is a collection of distributed argumentation agents and Pg is a preference hierarchy between these agents. An argumentation agent Ag is a binary-tuple < R, P > where R is a set of rules and P is a preference hierarchy between these rules. A preference hierarchy P is a set of ordered pair in which we say \"sis preferred than g\" (denoted by s > g) if and only if < s, g >E P. A rule is an EDLP clause of the form,\nwhere r is the name of the rule, a1 , • • . , an are all literals, ,...., is the non-provable sign1. We denote Cd(r) = {a1, ... , am}, Cn(r) = {am+l, . . . , an},\n1\"' a means a is not derivable.\n416 Ng, Wong, and Low\nStrong(Cd(r)) = {all··· ,al} and Weak(Cd(r)) = {al+1, ... ,am}· An argument Arg is a finite sequence of rules {ro, ... , TN} in which every rule ri satisfies the following conditions.\n1. If p E Strong(Cd(ri)) then there exists r E {ro, ... , ri-d and p = certain(r).\n2. There exists q E Cn(ri) and denoted as certain(ri), such that if l E {Cn(ri) - q} then\ni-1 [ E U certain{rj).\nj=O\n3 .. There does not exists r E {r0, ... , ri-d such that certain(ri) = certain(r) and certain(ri) certaih(r).\nThe function certain denotes a \"definite\" reading of an \"indefinite\" clause. certain(r) denotes a literal in the conclusion of an indefinite rule such that all other literals are pruned by their complementary counter parts other rules' certain. For example, the value of certain(r2) is a in the following argument: {r1 :--+ •b, r2 :--+ a V b }. Condition 1 ensures that every rule in an argument must be grounded. Conditions 2 and 3 ensure that a rule must have a unique meaning and rules in argument are not redundant, respectively. Re striction imposed by condition 2 is for the sake of sim plicity in demonstrating inter-KBS-conflicts.\n4 CONFLICTS WITHIN A KBS\nUnder our framework, conflicts within a K BS is re ferred to as intra-KBS-conflicts. As an example, con sider the following segment of a legal knowledge base <R,P>.\nr4 : --+ finger _print r5 : finger _print --+ murderer V owner r7 : \"' ownership--+ •owner r8 : \"' criminaLrecord --+ •murderer r6 : murderer --+ puLinto_jail r9 : --+ criminaLrecord\nFrom the above, the following arguments are found:\n2. Arg2 entails Arg1 and r6. Irrespective of the out come of the proof of ownership (r7 ), Arg2 al ways leads to the conclusion that the murderer should be puLinto_jail. Thus, both murderer and puLinto_jail are certain() in Arg1.\n3. Arg3 is formed solely by r8• Thus, certain() of Arg3 (i.e. --,murderer) is inconsistent with that of Arg2 (i.e. murderer). This kind of head-on conflicts is called rebut.\n4. Arg4 entails r9 alone. Note that it attacks the assumption of Arg3• We call this undercut.\nFrom the above example, we define the following:\nDefinition 1 Arg under-cuts Arl if and only if there exists a ruler in Arg, a ruler' in Arg' and a literal p in Weak(Cd(r')) such that p = certain(r).\nDefinition 2 Arg rebut Arg' if and only if there ex ists a rule r' in Arg' and a rule r in Arg satisfying certain(r) = certain(r'), r' > r � P.\nDefinition 3 Arg defeats Arg' if,\n1. Arg is empty and, Arg' undercuts itself; or\n2. Arg undercuts Arg'; or\n3. Arg rebuts Arg' and Arg' does not undercut Arg.\nThen, we define the asymmetric order strictly defeat as below.\nDefinition 4 Arg strictly defeats Arg' if only if Arg defeats Arg' but not Arg' defeats Arg.\n5 CONFLICTS BETWEEN KESS\nIn this section, we consider conflicts aroused in an ar gumentation system < Ags, Pg >. Conflicts pertain to a single KBS can also happen in a group of KBSs. To reflect that rebut is based on preference hierarchy, we add the following to the previous definition 2.\nDefinition 5 Arg of Ag1 E Ags rebuts Arg' of Ag2 E Ags if and only if there exists a rule r1 in Arg and a rule r2 in Arg' such that certain(r1) = certain(r2) and Ag2 > Ag1 � Pg.\nNext, we shall consider conflicts pertaining to uncer tainties between different KBSs. When knowledge is distributed over a set of agents, it is not uncommon to see that the same piece of knowledge represented differently in different agents. For example, Table 1 shows two agents, Agh and Agt2, which possess two variants of the same knowledge. It is intuitive to see that Agh will conclude puLinto_jail whereas Agt2 will not, owing to the uncertainty in r5. A direct merge of Agh and Agh will lead to puLinto_jail as Agh domi nates the union in the sense of classical logic. However, such conclusion essentially assumes certain informa tion with higher preference than uncertain information and is credulous in this regard. It is arguable that on what basis can we bear this assumption and cherish certain information rather than uncertain one? And on what basis we want to do it the other way round?\nResolving Conflicting Arguments under Uncertainties 417\nFrom the viewpoint of classical logic, we can interpret a rule r2 as a revision of another rule r5 if one shows that r5 is too loose a statement (see Table 1). This is exactly what embedded in the essence of classical logic. We called this a credulous view of distributed knowledge.\nIn many traditional reasoning frameworks, without the non-provability sign \"\"'• credulous view can help to. enlarge the set of positive information. However, this is not the case for our framework and most other non-monotonic systems which attack default reason ing. This can be shown by the following example which consists of two agents Agtt and Agt2 (see Table 1).\nIf we adopt the approach of classical logic, Agtt will clearly out-rate Agt2. Further, r3 is not applicable and hence, release is not deduced (which is deducible un der skeptical view, defined in the next section). Thus, credulous view is not necessarily additive in the pres ence of a skeptical view.\n5.2 Skeptical View\nWhe:ri our multi-agent framework is applied to the le gal reasoning domain, credulous inference is highly un desirable due to the spirit of \" proof beyond any reason able doubts\". Consider the last example, if ownership is also a plausible explanation for the evidence of one's finger print on an object, then how can we arrive at the conclusion of murderer with certainty? In fact, it is the job of the defense legal agent, in practice, to re trieve as many uncertain information as possible from legal knowledge bases and use them to presents \"rea sonable doubts\". Under such circumstances, we would prefer Agt2 's view to Agh. Such preference is actually a form of suppression and reveals conflicts between dif ferent KESs. Notice that this type of conflict aroused because of the great similarity between two variants of the same piece of information being distributed. In\nsyntactic form, we introduce\nDefinition 6 A rule r1 of Agt1 thins a rule r2 of Agt2 if and only if Cd(r2) = Cd(r1) and Cn(r2) C Cn(rt).\nThe semantic of thinning is self-explanatory. r1 is a more general statement about the relation between Cd(r2) and Cn(r2). It says that Cn(r1) - Cn(r2) are also possible outcomes of Cd(r2). In a modal sense, the necessity implied r1 is incorrect. Semantically , r2 in Agt2 weakens the certainty of r1 in Agh. We call this type of uncertain conflicts thinning. It happens due to a skeptical view in the distributed knowledge environment. In general, we refer this as inter-KBS conflicts.\nInter-KBS-conflicts pertain to any inference schema which supports qualitative uncertainties like disjunc tive in a distributed knowledge setting. A straight forward resolution scheme to inter-KBS-conflicts is to eliminate the additional uncertainties introduced, i.e. Cn(rt) - Cn(r2).\nFor intra-KBS-conflicts, rules related to the judgment is easily defined. It is, however, not the same for inter KBS-conflicts. As inter-KBS-conflicts aroused because of the additional uncertainties in a rule, we consider a set of auxiliary rules to determine the defeating status\n1. If a rule r1 thins a rule r2 , the set of auxiliary rules is auxiliary(r1,r2) = {Cd(r1) --+ qlq E (Cn(rt)- Cn(r2))} and every rule is an alias of r1 in preference hierarchy.\n2. An argument Arg is not defeated by a rule r1 if r1 thins a rule r2 in Arg and for every auxiliary ruler in auxiliary(r1, r2), there exists an justified argument defeating it.\nTo illustrate the idea here, let us consider the exam ple in Table 1 again. There is an argument Arg1 = { rt, r2, r6} in Agh. By definition, r5 and r2 of Arg1 show inter-KBS-conflict. The set of auxiliary rules is defined as,\nauxiliary(r5, r2) = {finger_print --+ qlq E (owner)}\n{finger _print --+ owner}\nTo maintain Arg1 's undefeated status, additional ar guments must be found to defeat auxiliary rules in auxiliary(r5, r2). However, there is no such a rule in Agh UAgt2.\nSimilar to credulous view, skeptical view also does not give us more certain information in reasoning. Con sideration of the simple example in the last subsection helps to illustrate this behavior. If we consider r5 as\n418 Ng, Wong, and Low\na thinning attacker, puLinto_jail cannot be derived from Agh. Thus, a skeptical view does not, in gen eral, enlarge the set of facts concluded.\n5.3 Generalized Skeptical View\nIn a skeptical view, we only focus on a particular type of similarity between disjunctive clauses. In this section, we extend the analysis to general similarity between two similar but yet distributed disjunctive clauses. In Table 2, we show the generalization of conflicting clauses of this kind. In the table , we as sume that both RA, RB and Rc, Rv are from different KBSs. Cond denotes the conjunctive condition where as r, A and Cone denote the disjunctive literal se quents. Also, RA and Rc are parts of arguments ArgA and Argc, respectively.\nThe notion of similarity is an extension of the skeptical view in which only subsumption is considered. In this extended setting, Rc and Rv are conflicting and Rv thins Argc. To determine the result, we consider the status of the rules involved, i.e. the unique meaning of Rc in Argc .\nIn both situations, we show that a generalized skep tical view does not introduce new things and can be tackled by the following techniques:\n1. Case 1 : If eertain(Rc) E Cone,\n• There exists arguments defeating Cn(Rc) - eertain(Rc ).\n• r <; {Cn(Rc)- eertain(Rc)}.\n• Thus, there exists arguments defeating r. • Rc degenerates to R'c : C ond ::::} Cone. • The problem is then reduced to subsumption\nproblem in previous section\n- R'c: Cond::::} Cone\n- Rv: Cond::::} Cone V A\n2. Case 2 : If eertain(Rc) E r,\n• There exists arguments defeating Cone.\n• The problem degenerates into\n- R'c : Cond::::} r - Rv: Cond::::} Cone V A\n• The conflict criteria are no longer met and thus can be neglect.\nThe simplicity achieved in Case 2 is due to our unique meaning restriction imposed on the argument defini tion. The situation will be extremely complex when the restriction is relaxed.\n6 SEMANTICS\nNow we have the bells and whistles to define our argu mentation semantics for resolving conflicts under un certainties. Formally, our semantics is based on a fix point operator II which operates on two sets of ar guments ArgSet and S. IIs(ArgSet) gives a subset of S such that all their counter-argumentsfdefeaters are strictly defeated by arguments in Arg. It can be proved that II is monotone in credulous view, skeptical view and generalized skeptical view. The fix-point op erator II is essentially the same as Prakken's (Prakken and Sartor, 1997). Our semantics differ from his in the definition of \"strictly defeat\" which is the core con cept of argumentation. Indeed, there are three kinds of fix-point operator. The key point is in what way the notion of counter-argument is interpreted. Table 3 summarizes the notion of counter-argument for dif ferent views shown in Sections 5.1 and 5.2."

An argument Arg is justified with respect to AS if and only if Arg E IIA.rgSet; it is defeated if and only if there exists a justified argument Arg' E AS strictly defeating it; and it is arguable, otherwise.\n7 DIALECTICAL PROOF THEORY\nDung proposed a dialectical proof theory for argumen tation in (Dung, 1995b). Prakken adopted it in his fixed priority framework. As the proof-theory is de fined on arguments, we show that a simplified version of it can also be used in our framework.\nA proof of an argument is defined on an argument tree. Each internal/external node is an argument and their child nodes are their defeaters. An argument tree T is constructed as below.\n1. Level 1 is the proposition to be justified.\n2. At an odd (even) level, a proponent (opponent) makes moves to strictly defeat all (any) moves from opponents (proponents) at previous levels.\n3. In any branch, an opponent cannot make the same move twice.\nA proponent is said to win a branch of an argument tree if and only if the opponent cannot make any fur ther move at the branch; and said to win an argument tree if and only if it wins all branches. An argument Arg is provably justified if it wins an argument tree at level 1; it is provably defeated if it is defeated by a provably justified argument; and it is provably ar guable, otherwise. It can be shown that an argument Arg is provably justified with respect to an argumenta tion system AS if and only if it is justified with respect to AS 2.\n8 RELATION TO EXIS TING FRAMEWORKS\nIt is easy to see that our approach collapses to Prakken's strict argumentation framework (Prakken and Sartor, 1997) when only one knowledge base is present or the set of knowledge bases is non disjunctive. Further, all arguments in rebuttal con flicts are arguable if priority is not available. In that situation, our framework reduces to partial semantics similar to Prakken's (Prakken and Sartor, 1997).\n2See appendix for details\n9 AN ILLUS TRATIVE EXAMPLE\nA company would like to perform strategically plan ning and seek an answer to the following question: Based on the current economic situations, is it prof itable to start a new production line?\nTo proceed, the company consulted two strategic plan ning experts, experts A and B. It was hoped that in dividual analysis from two independent sources could help review the intricacies of the scenario. Table 4 depicts knowledge set K B A and K B B extracted from expert A and B, respectively. The global order be tween experts is A > B.\nIn KBA, {A6, A1, As, A7, A4, A2} form an argu ment Arg1 . The unique meaning of Arg1 is new_productiordine which suggests a new production line for the business. { A7, A5} form another argument Arg2. Arg2 concludes that the market is stable which is contrary to the rule A3 in Arg1 . By definition, Arg2 rebut Arg1 . According to K B A's preference hierar chy, Arg1 wins. Thus, Arg1 is justified with respect to\n420 Ng, Wong, and Low\nKBA.\nIn KBB, {Bg,B1,B4,B2} form an argument Arg3, {B3} form Arg4, {B6,B5} form Arg5, {B7,B8} form Arg6. Arg3 is undercut by Arg5 which is then rebuted by Arg6. Arg3 undercuts Arg4. According to the pref erence hierarchy, Arg6 strictly defeats Arg5 and Arg3 is then justified. Arg4 is strictly defeated by the jus tified argument Arg3.\nConsider the notion of skeptical view, we notice that A1 of KBA and B1 of KBB are similar knowledge about the relation among \"adversary financial factor\" , \"economic grow\" and \"demand grow\". By definition, B1 thins Arg1, the argument with A1. The auxiliary rule is then,\nAi : ,...., adversary_financiaLfactor 1\\ economic_grow => competition_grow\nTo defeat B1 and restore Arg1 's justified status, we have to find arguments rebutting Ai. However, there is no such arguments. Thus, we have two different conclusions from KBA and KBB. Credulous view suggests a new production line whereas skeptical view does not suggest any strategic moves. The result is close to our intuitive understanding of credulous rea soning and skeptical reasoning.\n10 CONCLUS ION\nIn this paper, we have discussed the inherent assump tion in classical logic 3 and how it affects distributed reasoning under uncertainties. We have proposed an integrated framework for handling both intra-KBS� conflicts and inter-KBS-conflicts holistically. Further more, we have also discussed the general aspects of inter-KBS-conflicts for uncertainty reasoning.\nAs it is, our argumentation model is a little bit re strictive. It only works well in near horn (Reed et al., ) knowledge systems. Relaxing that restriction will lead us either to Stable semantics ( Gelfond and Lifs chitz, ) or Well-founded semantics (Ross, 1989). Such an extension not only bridges our framework to other frameworks in non-monotonic reasoning but also fa cilitates the modeling of more complex problems. In either way, it would be interesting to see how inter KBS-conflicts are modeled and resolved. These lay down the core of our future work.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is partially support by the direct grant from the Faculty of Engineering, CUHK, (grant number:\n3Certain information has higher preference than uncer tain information.\n2050180).

Arg is one of those proponent moves and the result follows. (1)1. By lemma 2, 3t E tree(Arg) s.t. all proponent moves oft are justified. (1)2. Root oft is justified. (1)3. Arg is root oft. (1)4. Arg is justified. D\nCompleteness Proof\nLemma 3 If Arg is a justified argument, then there exists an ar gument tree such that every moves of the proponent involves only justified arguments.\nPROOF SKETCH: We start to construct a tree inductively with a jus tified argument Arg. At every odd level i, we show that there exists justified arguments DArg strictly defeating the defeaters of level i. DArg can then form level i + 2's move. Then, we can inductively construct an argument tree by non repetitive moves of the opponent. AssUME: 1. Arg is justified.\n2. T is an argument tree. 3. Arg is at level 1 of T.\n(1)1. Basis : Level 3 is justified. AssUME: 1. D is the set of defeaters defeating level (A rg, 1). (2)1. 'Vd E D, 3 d E fix-point strictly defeating d. (2)2. DArg ={did E D} is justified by definition. (2)3. let level(Arg, 3) = DArg (2)4. Q.E.D. (1)2. Induction Step : If level i is justified, there exists justified level(Arg, i + 2) defeating level(Arg, i + 1)\nAssuME: 1. level(Arg, i) is justified. 2. level(Arg, i + 1) is non-empty. 3. arguable = {mlm E level(Arg, i) nm is defeated by level(Arg, i + 1) } (2)1. level(Arg, i + 1) defeats level(Arg, i) (2)2. 'Vm E arguable, there exists iii in fix-point defeating\nlevel(Arg, i + 1)\n(2)3. level(Arg, i + 2) = {mlm E arguable } (2)4. level(Arg, i + 2 is justified and defeats level(Arg, i + 1) (2)5. Q.E.D.\n(1)3. Completion : Thus, there exists a proof tree in which every proponent level involves only justified arguments. D\nTheorem 3 All justified arguments are provable.\nPROOF SKETCH: We prove the thesis by contradiction. Start with there exists a justified argument Arg that is not provable. Using lemma 3 we find an argument tree to support Arg and lead to a contradiction. ASSUME: 1. Arg is justified.\n2. By Lemma 3 and the hypothesis, 3 T, an argument tree such that a. every move of a proponent is justified b. a proponent cannot move in a branch B\n(1)1. Let 1. m = move(B,length(B)) 2. iii= move(B,length(B)-1) (1)2. iii is justified. (1)3. 3 m' , s.t. m' strictly defeats m. (1)4. m' is a viable move for the proponent. D"

In this pa­ per, we give such an analysis and based on the result, propose an integrated framework. Our framework extends definite argumenta­ tion theory to model uncertainty. It sup­ ports three views over conflicting and uncer­ tain knowledge. Thus, knowledge engineers can draw different conclusions depending on the application context (i.e. view).
