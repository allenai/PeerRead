{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Binary Paragraph Vectors", "abstract": "Recently Le & Mikolov described two log-linear models, called Paragraph Vector, that can be used to learn state-of-the-art distributed representations of documents. Inspired by this work, we present Binary Paragraph Vector models: simple neural networks that learn short binary codes for fast information retrieval. We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based binary codes, despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that binary paragraph vectors can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents. Finally, we present a model that simultaneously learns short binary codes and longer, real-valued representations. This model can be used to rapidly retrieve a short list of highly relevant documents from a large document collection.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This work proposes a model that can learn short binary codes via paragraph vectors to allow fast retrieval of documents.

Below we list the most important changes. We will then follow with responses to the reviews.\n\n1) AnonReviewer3 pointed out that, apart from the Krizhevsky's binarization, one can also employ stochastic neurons in the coding layer. When comparing these two approaches we carried out a more thorough investigation of the dropout in the coding layers. In the initial experiments we employed small, 10% dropout. However, larger dropout rates (up to 50%) turned out to improve performance on the validation sets (in both binary and real-valued models). We therefore updated final results to reflect the dropout rates selected in validation experiments.\n\n2) We extended the comparison with baseline methods by adding results for two hashing techniques, namely random hyperplane projection and iterative quantization.\n\n3) Visualization of Binary PV codes (Figure 5 in the previous version of the paper) along with the corresponding text was moved to an appendix.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "17 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer5", "TITLE": "A few comments", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The method in this paper introduces a binary encoding level in the PV-DBOW and PV-DM document embedding methods (from Le & Mikolov'14). The binary encoding consists in a sigmoid with trained parameters that is inserted after the standard training stage of the embedding.\n \nFor a document to encode, the binary vector is obtained by forcing the sigmoid to output a binary output for each of the embedding vector components. The binary vector can then be used for compact storage and fast comparison of documents.\n \nPros:\n \n- the binary representation outperforms the Semantic hashing method from Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09\n \n- the experimental approach sound: they compare on the same experimental setup as Salakhutdinov & Hinton '09, but since in the meantime document representations improved (Le & Mikolov'14), they also combine this new representation with an RBM to show the benefit of their binary PV-DBOW/PV-DM\n \nCons:\n \n- the insertion of the sigmoid to produce binary codes (from Lin & al. '15) in the training process is incremental\n \n- the explanation is too abstract and difficult to follow for a non-expert (see details below)\n \n- a comparison with efficient indexing methods used in image retrieval is missing. For large-scale indexing of embedding vectors, derivations of the Inverted multi-index are probably more interesting than binary codes. See eg. Babenko & Lempitsky, Efficient Indexing of Billion-Scale Datasets of Deep Descriptors, CVPR'16\n \nDetailed comments:\n \nSection 1: the motivation for producing binary codes is not given. Also, the experimental section could give some timings and mem usage numbers to show the benefit of binary embeddings\n \nfigure 1, 2, 3: there is enough space to include more information on the representation of the model: model parameters + training objective + characteristic sizes + dropout. In particular, in fig 2, it is not clear why \"embedding lookup\" and \"linear projection\" cannot be merged in a single smaller lookup table (presumably because there is an intermediate training objective that prevents this).\n \np2: \"This way, the length of binary codes is not tied to the dimensionality of word embeddings.\" -> why not?\n \nsection 3: This is the experimental setup of  Salakhutdinov & Hinton 2009. Specify this and whether there is any difference between the setups.\n \n\"similarity of the inferred codes\": say here that codes are compared using Hamming distances.\n \n\"binary codes perform very well, despite their far lower capacity\" -> do you mean smaller size than real vectors?\n \nfig 5: these plots could be dropped if space is needed.\n \nsection 3.1: one could argue that \"transferring\" from Wikipedia to anything else cannot be called transferring, since Wikipedia's purpose is to include all topics and lexical domains\n \nsection 3.2: specify how the 300D real vectors are compared. L2 distance? inner product?\n \nfig4: specify what the raw performance of the large embedding vectors is (without pre-filtering with binary codes), or equivalently, the perf of (code-size, Hamming dis) = (28, 28), (24, 24), etc.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "03 Jan 2017", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 2}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper presents a method to represent text documents and paragraphs as short binary codes to allow fast similarity search and retrieval by using hashing techniques. The real-valued paragraph vectors by Le & Mikolov is extended by adding a stochastic binary layer on top of the neural network architecture. Two methods for binarizing the final activations are compared: (1) simply adding noise to sigmoid activations to encourage discritization. (2) binarizing the activations in the forward pass and keeping them real-valued in the backward pass (straight-through estimation). The paper presents encouraging results by using straight-through estimation on 20 newsgroup and RCV1 text datasets by using 128 and 32 bit binary codes.\n\nOn the plus side, the application presented in the paper is interesting and important. The exposition of the paper is clean and clear. However, the novelty of the approach is limited from a machine learning standpoint. The literature on binary hashing beyond semantic hashing and Krizhevsky's binary autoencoders in 2011 is not explained. An important baseline is missing where real-valued paragraph vectors are learned first, and then converted to binary codes using off-the-shelf hashing methods (e.g. random projection LSH by Charikar, BRE by Kulis & Darrell, ITQ by Gong & Lazebnik, MLH by Norouzi & Fleet, etc.)\n\nGiven the lack of novelty and the missing baseline, I do not recommend this paper in its current for publication in the ICLR conference's proceeding. Moving forward, this paper may be more suitable for NLP conferences as it is more on the applied side.\n\nMore comments:\n- I believe from an practical perspective it may be easier to first learn real-valued paragraph vectors and then quantize them for indexing. That said, an end-to-end approach as proposed in this paper may perform better. I would like to see an empirical comparison between the proposed end-to-end approach and a simpler two stage quantization method suggested here.\n- See \"Estimating or Propagating Gradients Through Stochastic Neurons\" By Bengio et al - discussing straight through estimation and some other alternatives.\n- The paper argues that the length of binary codes cannot be longer than 32 bits because longer codes are not suitable for document hashing. This is not quite right given multi-probe hashing mechanisms, for example see \"Mult-index Hashing\" by Norouzi et al.\n- See \"Hashing for Similarity Search: A Survey\" by Wang et al. for a survey of related work on binary hashing and quantization.
