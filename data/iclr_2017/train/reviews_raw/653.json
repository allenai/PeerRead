{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Inefficiency of stochastic gradient descent with larger mini-batches (and more learners)", "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants are the most important optimization algorithms used in large scale machine learning. Mini-batch version of stochastic gradient is often used in practice for taking advantage of hardware parallelism. In this work, we analyze the effect of mini-batch size over SGD convergence for the case of general non-convex objective functions. Building on the past analyses, we justify mathematically that there can often be a large difference between the convergence guarantees provided by small and large mini-batches (given each instance processes equal number of training samples), while providing experimental evidence for the same. Going further to distributed settings, we show that an analogous effect holds with popular Asynchronous Gradient Descent (\\asgd): there can be a large difference between convergence guarantees with increasing number of learners given that the cumulative number of training samples processed remains the same. Thus there is an inherent (and similar) inefficiency introduced in the convergence behavior when we attempt to take advantage of parallelism, either by increasing mini-batch size or by increase the number of learners.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper addresses the problem of the influence of mini-batch size on the SGD convergence in a general non-convex setting. The results are then translated to analyze the influence of the number of learners on ASGD. I find the problem addressed in the paper relevant and the theoretical part clearly written. The experimental evaluation is somehow limited though. I would like to see experiments on more data sets and more architectures, as well as richer evaluation, e.g. N=16 is a fairly small experiment. It would also enhance the paper if the experiments were showing a similar behavior of other popular methods like momentum SGD or maybe EASGD (the latter in distributed setting).

Similar results are already known (at least as folk theory) in simpler regimes, but this result is novel. The reviewers are mixed in their opinions of the paper, but AnonReviewer4 brings up a point that deserves further attention: the analysis assumes that the same step-size is used for different mini-batch sizes. Because of this assumption, the conclusion of the paper is misleading. One of the effects of increasing the mini-batch is to decrease the variance of the estimator, which allows a larger step-size. With this larger step-size the net effect of increasing the mini-batch can actually be positive even in terms of the number of examples. Fixing the step-size removes the chance for the mini-batch strategy to do better in theory, and there is indeed a large amount of empirical evidence that mini-batches can lead to practical improvements. I do think the authors should continue this work, but I think accepting the current version is problematic because of the current conclusion.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Check Lemma 1", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper theoretically justified a faster convergence (in terms of average gradient norm attained after processing a fixed number of samples) of using small mini-batches for SGD or ASGD with smaller number of learners.

A similar behavior is discussed for using multiple learners in asynchronous SGD. This behavior has been known in convex optimization (e.g., \"Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods\", NIPS 2011). There, the convergence is of the form O(1/\\sqrt{bT}+1/T), and so using bT samples only lead to \\sqrt{b} time improvement. This paper extends a similar result to the nonconvex case (but the underlying mathematics is mainly from [Ghadimi & Lan, 2013]). However, this behavior is also known and indeed has been summarized in the deep learning textbook (chapter 8). Hence, the novelty is limited.\n\nThe theoretical results in this paper suggest that it is best not to use mini-batch. However, using mini-batch is often beneficial in practice. As discussed in the deep learning textbook, using mini-batch allows using a larger learning rate (note that this paper assumes the same learning rate for both mini-batch sizes). Moreover, multicore architectures allows parallel execution of mini-batch almost for free. Hence, the practical significance of the results is also limited.\n\nOther comments:\n- Equation (4): since the same number of samples (S) is processed and S=MK, where M is the mini-batch size and K is the number of mini-batches processed (as mentioned in the first paragraph of section 2), when two different mini-batch sizes are considered (M_l and M_h), their K's should differ. However, the same K is used on the LHS of (4).\n\n- Figures 1 and 2: As convergence speed is of main interest, why not show the training objective instead?", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Interesting paper", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper addresses the problem of the influence of mini-batch size on the SGD convergence in a general non-convex setting.
