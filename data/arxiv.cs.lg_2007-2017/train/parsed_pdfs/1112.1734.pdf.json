      "text" : "The development of the data storing technologies has increased the data storage capacity of companies. Nowadays the companies have technology to store detailed information about each performed transaction, generating large databases. This stored information may help the companies to improve themselves and because of this the companies have sponsored researches and the development of tools to analyse the databases and generate useful information.\nDuring years, manual methods had been used to convert data in knowledge. However, the use of these methods has become expensive, time consuming, subjective and non-viable when applied at large databases.\nThe problems with the manual methods stimulated the development of processes of automatic analysis, like the process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases or Data Mining. This process is defined as a process of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data [6].\nIn the Data Mining process, the use of the association rules technique may generate large quantities of patterns. This technique has caught the attention of companies and research centers [3]. Several researches have been developed with this technique and the results are used by the companies to improve their\nar X\niv :1\n11 2.\n17 34\nv1 [\ncs .D\nB ]\n7 D\nbusinesses (insurance policy, health policy, geo-processing, molecular biology) [8, 4, 9].\nA way to solve the problem of the large quantities of patterns extracted by the association rules technique is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge [1, 8, 10]. The taxonomies may be used to prune uninteresting and/or redundant rules (patterns) [1].\nIn this paper the GART algorithm and the RulEE-GAR computational module is proposed. The GART algorithm (Generalization of Association Rules using Taxonomies) uses taxonomies to generalize association rules. The RulEEGAR computational module uses the GART algorithm, to generalize association rules, and provides several means to analyze the generalized rules.\nThis paper is organized as following: first by presenting the association rules technique and some general features about the use of taxonomies, second by describing the GART algorithm and the RulEE-GAR computational module. Finally the results of some experiments performed with the GART algorithm along with our conclusion are presented."

      "text" : "An association rule LHS ⇒ RHS represents a relationship between the sets of items LHS and RHS [2]. Each item I is an atom representing the presence of a particular object. The relation is characterized by two measures: support and confidence. The support of a rule R within a dataset D, where D itself is a collection of sets of items (or itemsets), is the number of transaction in D that contain all the elements in LHS ∪ RHS. The confidence of the rule is the proportion of transactions that contain LHS ∪ RHS with respect to the number of transactions that contain LHS. The problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the minimum support and minimum confidence defined by the user to mine association rules. High values of minimum support and minimum confidence just generate trivial rules. Low values of minimum support and minimum confidence generate large quantities of rules (patterns), complicating the user’s analysis.\nA way of overcoming the difficulties in the analysis of large quantities of association rules is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge. The use of taxonomies may help the user to identify interesting and useful knowledge in the extracted rules set. The taxonomies represent a collective or individual characterization of how the items can be classified hierarchically [1]. In Fig. 1 an example of a taxonomy is presented where it can be observed that: t-shirts are light clothes, shorts are light clothes, light clothes are a kind of sport clothes, sandals are a kind of shoes.\nIn the literature there are several algorithms to generate association rules using taxonomies (generalized association rules). Algorithms like Cumulate and Stratify [10] generate rules sets larger than rules sets generated without taxonomies (because they generate association rules with and without taxonomies). To try decrease the quantity of generated rules, a subjective measure is used to\nprune the uninteresting rules [10]. The subjective measure does not guarantee that the quantity of rules will decrease. Our method proposes an algorithm and a module of post-processing [5]. Using the module, the user looks to a small set of rules without taxonomies, builds some taxonomies and then uses the algorithm to generalize the association rules, pruning the original rules that are generalized. Thus our algorithm always decreases or keeps the volume of the rules sets. The proposed algorithm and module are presented in Section 3 and 4.\n3 The Algorithm GART\nWe analysed the structure of the association rules generated by algorithms that do not use taxonomies. The results of the analysis show us that it is possible to generalize association rules using taxonomies. In Fig. 2 we show how the association rules can be generalized.\nFirst we changed the items t-shirt and short of the rules short & slipper ⇒ cap, sandal & short ⇒ cap, sandal & t-shirt ⇒ cap and slipper & t-shirt ⇒ cap by the item light clothes (which represents a generalization). This change generated two rules light clothes & slipper ⇒ cap and two rules light clothes & sandal ⇒ cap. Next, we pruned the repeated generalized rules, maintaining only the two rules: light clothes & slipper ⇒ cap and light clothes & sandal ⇒ cap.\nThe two rules generated by the Step 1 (Fig. 2) were generalized again. We changed the items slipper and sandal by the item light shoes (which represented another generalization) generating two rules light clothes & light shoes ⇒ cap. Then we pruned the repeated generalized rules again, maintaining only one generalized association rule: light clothes & light shoes ⇒ cap.\nDue to the possibility of generalization of the association rules (Fig. 2), we propose an algorithm to generalize association rules. The proposed algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 3. We called the proposed algorithm of GART (Generalization of Association Rules using Taxonomies).\nThe proposed algorithm just generalizes one side of the association rules - LHS or RHS (after to look to a small set of rules without taxonomies, the user decides which side will be generalized). First, we grouped the rules in subsets that present equal antecedents or consequents. If the algorithm were used to generalize the left hand side of the rules (LHS), the subsets would be generated using the equals consequents (RHS). If the algorithm were used to generalize the right hand side of the rules (RHS), the subsets would be generated using the equal antecedents (LHS). Next, we used the taxonomies to generalize each subset (as illustrated in Fig. 2). In the final algorithm we stored the rules in a set of generalized association rules.\nIn the final algorithm, we also calculated the Contingency Table for each generalized association rules to get more information about the rules. The Contingency Table of a rule represents the coverage of the rule with respect to the database used in its mining [7]. With the calculation of the Contingency Table we finished the algorithm.\n4 The Computational Module RulEE-GAR\nIn this section we present the RulEE-GAR computational module that provides means to generalize association rules and also to analyze the generalized rules [5]. The generalization of the association rules is performed by the GART algorithm, described in the previous section. Next we describe the means to analyze the generalized association rules. In Fig. 4 we showed the screen of the interface that enables the user to analyze and to explore the generalized rules sets.\nOn the screen of the analysis interface of generalized rules (Fig. 4) there are some spaces where the user puts data to make a query and select a set of generalized rules, accompanied or not of several evaluation measures [7], to be analyzed. Besides allowing the user to select a set of rules, the interface provides four links in the section Downloads to look for and/or download the files. The files contain, respectively, the set of transactional data (Data Set), the set of\nsource rules (Rule Set), the set of generalized rules (Generalized Rule Set) and the set of taxonomies used to generalize the rules (Taxonomy Set).\nBesides links for visualization and/or download of the files, each generalized association rule presents others links that enable the user to explorer information about the generalization of the rule. The links are positioned at the left side of the rules (Fig. 4). The links are described as following:\nExpanded Rule It is represented in the interface by the letter “E”. This link enables the user to see the generalized rule in expanded way. The generalized items of a rule are changed by the respective specific items. Source Rules It is represented in the interface by the letter “S”. This link enables the user to see the source rules that were generalized. Measures It is represented in the interface by the letter “M”. This link is available only if the user selects the support (Sup) and/or confidence (Cov) measures in its query and these measures present values lower than the minimum support and/or minimum confidence values defined to the mining process of the rules set not generalized. With this link it is possible to see which generalized rules have support and/or confidence values lower than the minimum support and/or minimum confidence values.\nIn Fig. 4 we also see that the generalized items in a rule (items between parentheses) are presented as links. These links enable the user to see the source items that were generalized. In the analysis interface, the user can also store the information, selected by the query, in a text file."

      "text" : "We performed some experiments using the GART algorithm to demonstrate that the use of taxonomies, to generalize large rules sets, reduces large quantities of association rules and makes easy the analysis of the rules.\nThe experiments were performed using a sale database of a Brazilian supermarket. The database contained sales data of the recent 3 month. We made 4 partitions of the database to perform the experiments. The partitions were made using the sale data along of 1 day, 7 days, 14 days and 1 month.\nTo generate the association rules, we used the implementation of the Apriori algorithm performed by Chistian Borgelt3 with minimum support value equal 0.5, minimum confidence value equal 0.5 and a maximum number of 5 items by rule. The generated rules sets are described as following:\n– RuleSet 1day - 32668 rules generated using the partition of 1 day; – RuleSet 7days - 19166 rules generated using the partition of 7 days; – RuleSet 14days - 16053 rules generated using the partition of 14 days; – RuleSet 1month - 21505 rules generated using the partition of 1 month;\n3 Available for downloading at the web site http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/\n~borgelt/software.html.\n– RuleSet 3months - 19936 rules generated using the whole database (3 months of sale data).\nTo perform the experiments, we looked to the database and to the 5 sets of association rules generated to make 18 sets of taxonomies. Then we ran the GART algorithm combining each set of taxonomies with each set of rules. In Fig. 5 a chart is presented that shows the reduction rates of the 5 rules sets after running GART algorithm using the 18 sets of taxonomies to generalize each rules set. In Fig. 5 the sets of taxonomies are called “T” followed by an identification number, as for example: T01.\nAs it can be observed in Fig. 5, the experiments show reduction rates of the sets of association rules varying from 14,61% to 50,11%."
