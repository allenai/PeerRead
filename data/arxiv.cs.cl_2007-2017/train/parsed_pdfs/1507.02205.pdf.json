      "text" : "Online discussion forums are a popular platform for people to share their views about current events and learn about issues of concern to them. Discussion forums tend to specialize on different topics, and people participating in them form communities of interest. The reaction of people within a community to comments posted provides an indication of community endorsement of opinions and value of information. In most discussions, the vast majority of comments spawn little reaction. In this paper, we look at whether (and how) language use affects the reaction, compared to the relative importance of the author and timing of the post.\nEarly work on factors that appear to influence crowd-based judgments of comments in the Slashdot forum (Lampe and Resnick, 2004) indicate that timing, starting score, length of the comment, and poster anonymity/reputation appear to play a role (where anonymity has a negative effect). Judging by differences in popularity of various discussion forums, topic is clearly important. Evidence that language use also matters is provided by recent work (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al., 2012; Lakkaraju et al., 2013; Althoff et al., 2014;\nTan et al., 2014). Teasing these different factors apart, however, is a challenge. The work presented in this paper provides additional insight into this question by controlling for these factors in a different way than previous work and by examining multiple communities of interest. Specifically, using data from Reddit discussion forums, we look at the role of author reputation as measured in terms of a karma k-index, and control for topic and timing by ranking comments in a constrained window within a discussion.\nThe primary contributions of this work include findings about the role of author reputation and variation across communities in terms of aspects of language use that matter, as well as the problem formulation, associated data collection, and development of a variety of features for characterizing informativeness, community response, relevance and mood."

      "heading" : "2 Data",
      "text" : "Reddit1 is the largest public online discussion forum with a wide variety of subreddits, which makes it a good data source for studying how textual content in a discussion impacts the response of the crowd. On Reddit, people initiate a discussion thread with a post (a question, a link to a news item, etc.), and others respond with comments. Registered users vote on which posts and comments are important. The total amount of up votes minus the down votes (roughly) is called karma; it provides an indication of community endorsement and popularity of a comment, as used in (Lakkaraju et al., 2013). Karma is valued as it impacts the order in which the posts or comments are displayed, with the high karma content rising to the top. Karma points are also accumulated by members of the discussion forum as a function of the karma associated with their comments.\n1http://www.reddit.com\nar X\niv :1\n50 7.\n02 20\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 A\nug 2\n01 5\nThe Reddit data is highly skewed. Although there are thousands of active communities, only a handful of them are large. Similarly, out of the more than a million comments made per day2, most of them receive little to no attention; the distributions of positive comment karma and author karma are Zipfian. Slightly more than half of all comments have exactly one karma point (no votes beyond the author), and only 5% of comments have less than one karma point.\nFor this study, we downloaded all the posts and associated comments made to six subreddits over a few weeks, as summarized in Table 1, as well as karma of participants in the discussion3. All available comments on each post were downloaded at least 48 hours after the post was made.4"

      "heading" : "3 Uptake Factors",
      "text" : "Factors other than the language use that influence whether a comment will have uptake from the community include the topic, the timing of the message, and the messenger. These factors are all evident in the Reddit discussions. Some subreddits are more popular and thus have higher karma comments than others, reflecting the influence of topic. Comments that are posted early in the discussion are more likely to have high karma, since they have more potential responses.\nPrevious studies on Twitter show that the reputation of the author substantially increases the chances of the retweet (Suh et al., 2010; Cha et al., 2010), and reputation is also raised as a factor in Slashdot (Lampe and Resnick, 2004). On Reddit most users are anonymous, but it is possible that members of a forum become familiar with particular usernames associated with high karma comments. In order to see how important per-\n2http://www.redditblog.com/2014/12/reddit-in-2014.html 3Our data collection is available online at https://ssli.ee.washington.edu/tial/data/reddit 4Based on our initial look at the data, we noticed that most posts receive all of their comments within 48 hours. Some comments are deleted before we are able to download them.\nsonal reputation is, we looked at how often the top karma comments are associated with the top karma participants in the discussion. Since an individual’s karma can be skewed by a few very popular posts, we measure reputation instead using a measure we call the k-index, defined to be equal to the number of comments in each user’s history that have karma ≥ k. The k-index is analgous to the h-index (Hirsch, 2005) and arguably a better indicator of extended impact than total karma.\nThe results in Table 2 address the question of whether the top karma comments always come from the top karma person. The Top1 column shows the percentage of threads where the top karma comment in a discussion happens to be made by the highest k-index person participating in the discussion; the next column shows the percentage of threads where the comment comes from any one of the top 3 k-index people. We find that, in fact, the highest karma comment in a discussion is rarely from the highest k-index people. The highest percentage is in ASKSCIENCE, where expertise is more highly valued. If we consider whether any one of the multiple comments that the top k-index person made is the top karma comment in the discussion, then the frequency is even lower."

      "heading" : "4.1 Tasks",
      "text" : "Having shown that the reputation of the author of a post is not a dominating factor in predicting high karma comments, we propose to control for topic and timing by ranking a set of 10 comments that were made consecutively in a short window of time within one discussion thread according to the karma they finally received. The ranking has access to the comment history about these posts. This simulates the view of an early reader of these posts, i.e., without influence of the ratings of oth-\ners, so that the language content of the post is more likely to have an impact. Very long threads are sampled, so that these do not dominate the set of lists. Approximately 75% of the comment lists are designated for training and the rest is for testing, with splits at the discussion thread level. Here, feature selection is based on mean precision of the top-ranked comment (P@1), so as to emphasize learning the rare high karma events. (Note that P@1 is equivalent to accuracy but allows for any top-ranking comment to count as correct in the case of ties.) The system performance is evaluated using both P@1 and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) (Burges et al., 2005), which is a standard criterion for ranking evaluation when the samples to be ranked have meaningful differences in scores, as is the case for karma of the comments.\nIn addition, for analysis purposes, we report results for three surrogate tasks that can be used in the ranking problem: i) the binary ranker trained on all comment pairs within each list, in which low karma comments dominate, ii) a positive vs. negative karma classifier, and iii) a high vs. medium karma classifier. All use class-balanced data; the second two are trained and tested on a biased sampling of the data, where the pairs need not be from the same discussion thread."

      "heading" : "4.2 Classifier",
      "text" : "We use the support vector machine (SVM) rank algorithm (Joachims, 2002) to predict a rank order for each list of comments. The SVM is trained to predict which of a pair of comments has higher karma. The error term penalty parameter is tuned to maximize P@1 on a held-out validation set (20% of the training samples).\nSince much of the data includes low-karma comments, there will be a tendancy for the learning to emphasize features that discriminate comments at the lower end of the scale. In order to learn features that improve P@1, and to understand the relative importance of different features, we use a greedy automatic feature selection process that incrementally adds one feature whose resulting feature set achives the highest P@1 on the validation set. Once all features have been used, we select the model with the subset of features that obtains the best P@1 on the validation set."

      "heading" : "4.3 Features",
      "text" : "The features are designed to capture several key attributes that we hypothesize are predictive of comment karma motivated by related work. The features are categorized in groups as summarized below, with details in supplementary material. • Graph and Timing (G&T): A baseline that\ncaptures discourse history (response structure) and comment timing, but no text content. • Authority and Reputation (A&R): K-index,\nwhether the commenter was the original poster, and in some subreddits “flair” (display next to a comment author’s username that is subject to a cursory verification by moderators). • Informativeness (Info.): Different indicators\nsuggestive of informative content and novelty, including various word counts, named entity counts, urls, and unseen n-grams. • Lexical Unigrams (Lex.): Miscellaneous word\nclass indicators, puncutation, and part-ofspeech counts • Predicted Community Response (Resp.):\nProbability scores from surrogate classification tasks (reply vs. no reply, positive vs. negative sentiment) to measure the community response of a comment using bag-of-words predictors. • Relevance (Rel.): Comment similarity to the\nparent, post and title in terms of topic, computed with three methods: i) a distributed vector representation of topic using a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) model (Xu et al., 2003), ii) the average of skip-gram word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), and iii) word set Jaccard similarity (Strehl et al., 2000). • Mood: Mean and std. deviation of sentence sen-\ntiment in the comment; word list indicators for politeness, argumentativeness and profanity. • Community Style (Comm.): Posterior proba-\nbility of each subreddit given the comment using a bag-of-words model. The various word lists are motivated by feature exploration studies in surrogate tasks. For example, projecting words to a two dimensional space of positive vs. negative and likelihood of reply showed that self-oriented pronouns were more likely to have no response and secondperson pronouns were more likely to have a negative response. The politeness and argumentativeness/profanity lists are generated by starting with hand-specified seed lists used to train an SVM to classify word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013)\ninto these categories, and expanding the lists with 500 words farthest from the decision boundary.\nBoth the NMF and the skip-gram topic models use a cosine distance to determine topic similarity, with 300 as the word embedding dimension. Both are trained on approximately 2 million comments in high karma posts taken across a wide variety of subreddits. We use topic models in various measures of comment relevance to the discussion, but we do not use topic of the comment on its own since topic is controlled for by ranking within a thread."
    }, {
      "heading" : "5 Ranking Experiments",
      "text" : "We present three sets of experiments on comment karma ranking, all of which show very different behavior for the different subreddits. Fig. 1 shows the relative gain in P@1 over the G&T baseline associated with using different feature groups. The importance of the different features reflect the nature of the different communities. The authority/reputation features help most for ASKSCIENCE, consistent with our k-index study. Informativeness and relevance help all subreddits except ASKMEN and WORLDNEWS. Lexical, mood and community style features are useful in some cases, but hurt others. The predicted probability of a reply was least useful, possibly because of the low-karma training bias.\nTables 3 and 4 summarize the results for the P@1 and NDCG criteria using the greedy selection procedure (which optimizes P@1) compared to a random baseline and the G&T baseline. The random baseline for P@1 is greater than 10% because of ties. The G&T baseline results show that the graph and timing features alone obtain 21-32%\nof top karma comments depending on subreddits. Adding the textual features gives an improvement in P@1 performance over the G&T baseline for all subreddits except ASKMEN and WORLDNEWS. The trends for performance measured with NDCG are similar, but the benefit from textual features is smaller. The results in both tables show different ways of reporting performance of the same system, but the system has been optimized for P@1 in terms of feature selection. In initial exploratory experiments, this seems to have a small impact: when optimizing for NDCG in feature selection we obtain 0.61 vs. 0.60 with the P@1-optimized features.\nA major challenge with identifying high karma comments (and negative karma comments) is that\nthey are so rare. Although our feature selection tunes for high rank precision, it is possible that the low-karma data dominate the learning. Alternatively, it may be that language cues are mainly useful for identifying distinguishing the negative or mid-level karma comments, and that the very high karma comments are a matter of timing. To better understand the role of language for these different types, we trained classifiers on balanced data for positive vs. negative karma and high vs. mid levels of karma. For these models, the training pairs could come from different threads, but topic is controlled for in that all topic features are relative (similarity to original post, parent, etc.). We compared the results to the binary classifier used in ranking, where all pairs are considered. In all three cases, random chance accuracy is 50%.\nTable 5 shows the pairwise accuracy of these classifiers. We find that distinguishing positive from negative classes is fairly easy, with the notable exception of the more information-oriented subreddit ASKSCIENCE. Averaging across the different subreddits, the high vs. mid task is slightly easier than the general ranking task, but the variation across subreddits is substantial. The high vs. mid distinction for FITNESS falls below chance (likely overtraining), whereas it seems to be an easier task for the ASKWOMEN, ASKMEN, and WORLDNEWS."

Tan et al. (2014) study how word choice affects the pop-\nularity of Twitter messages. As in our work, they control for topic, but they also control for the popularity of the message authors. On Reddit, we find that celebrity status is less important than it is on Twitter since on Reddit almost everyone is anonymous. Lakkaraju et al. (2013) study how timing and language affect the popularity of posting images on Reddit. They control for content by only making comparisons between reposts of the same image. Our focus is on studying comments within a discussion instead of standalone posts, and we analyze a vast majority of language features. Althoff et al. (2014) use deeper language analysis on Reddit to predict the success of receiving a pizza in the Random Acts of Pizza subreddit. To our knowledge, this is the first work on ranking comments in terms of community endorsement."

      "text" : "This paper addresses the problem of how language affects the reaction of community in Reddit comments. We collect a new dataset of six subredit discussion forums. We introduce a new task of ranking comments based on karma in Reddit discussions, which controls for topic and timing of comments. Our results show that using language features improve the comment ranking task in most of the subreddits. Informativeness and relevance are the most broadly useful feature categories; reputation matters for ASKSCIENCE, and other categories could either help or hurt depending on the community. Future work involves improving the classification algorithm by using new approaches to learning about rare events."
