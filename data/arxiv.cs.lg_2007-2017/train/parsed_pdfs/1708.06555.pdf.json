This task typically involves the learning of short range dependencies, which generally model the syntactic properties of a language and/or long range dependencies, which are semantic in nature. We propose in this paper a new multi-span architecture, which separately models the short and long context information while it dynamically merges them to perform the language modeling task. This is done through a novel recurrent Long-Short Range Context (LSRC) network, which explicitly models the local (short) and global (long) context using two separate hidden states that evolve in time. This new architecture is an adaptation of the Long-Short Term Memory network (LSTM) to take into account the linguistic properties. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art language modeling techniques."

      "text" : "A high quality Language Model (LM) is considered to be an integral component of many systems for speech and language technology applications, such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), speech recognition (Katz, 1987), etc. The goal of an LM is to identify and predict probable sequences of predefined linguistic units, which are typically words.\nThese predictions are typically guided by the semantic and syntactic properties encoded by the LM.\nIn order to capture these properties, classical LMs were typically developed as fixed (short) context techniques such as, the word count-based methods (Rosenfeld, 2000; Kneser and Ney, 1995), commonly known as N -gram language models, as well as the Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) (Bengio et al., 2003), which were introduced as an alternative to overcome the exponential growth of parameters required for larger context sizes in N -gram models.\nIn order to overcome the short context constraint and capture long range dependencies known to be present in language, Bellegarda (1998a) proposed to use Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) to capture the global context, and then combine it with the standard N -gram models, which capture the local context. In a similar but more recent approach, Mikolov and Zweig (2012) showed that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based LM performance can be significantly improved using an additional global topic information obtained using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In fact, although recurrent architectures theoretically allow the context to indefinitely cycle in the network, Hai Son et al. (2012) have shown that, in practice, this information changes quickly in the classical RNN (Mikolov et al., 2010) structure, and that it is experimentally equivalent to an 8-gram FFNN. Another alternative to model linguistic dependencies, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) (Sundermeyer et al., 2012), addresses some learning issues from the original RNN by controlling the longevity of context information in the netar X iv :1 70 8. 06 55\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 A\nug 2\nwork. This architecture, however, does not particularly model long/short context but rather uses a single state to model the global linguistic context.\nMotivated by the works in (Bellegarda, 1998a; Mikolov and Zweig, 2012), this paper proposes a novel neural architecture which explicitly models 1) the local (short) context information, generally syntactic, as well as 2) the global (long) context, which is semantic in nature, using two separate recurrent hidden states. These states evolve in parallel within a long-short range context network. In doing so, the proposed architecture is particularly adapted to model natural languages that manifest local-global context information in their linguistic properties.\nWe proceed as follows. Section 2 presents a brief overview of short vs long range context language modeling techniques. Section 3 introduces the novel architecture, Long-Short Range Context (LSRC), which explicitly models these two dependencies. Then, Section 4 evaluates the proposed network in comparison to different state-of-the-art language models on the PTB and the LTCB corpus. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."

      "text" : "The goal of a language model is to estimate the probability distribution p(wT1 ) of word sequences wT1 = w1, · · · , wT . Using the chain rule, this distribution can be expressed as\np(wT1 ) = T∏ t=1 p(wt|wt−11 ) (1)\nThis probability is generally approximated under different simplifying assumptions, which are typically derived based on different linguistic observations. All these assumptions, however, aim at modeling the optimal context information, be it syntactic and/or semantic, to perform the word prediction. The resulting models can be broadly classified into two main categories: long and short range context models. The rest of this section presents a brief overview of these categories with a particular focus on Neural Network (NN)-based models."

In this case, (1) becomes\np(wT1 ) ≈ T∏ t=1 p(wt|wt−1t−N+1) (2)\nThe most popular methods that subscribe in this category are the N -gram models (Rosenfeld, 2000; Kneser and Ney, 1995) as well as the FFNN model (Bengio et al., 2003), which estimates each of the terms involved in this product, i.e, p(wt|wt−1t−N+1) in a single bottom-up evaluation of the network.\nAlthough these methods perform well and are easy to learn, the natural languages that they try to encode, however, are not generated under a Markov model due to their dynamic nature and the long range dependencies they manifest. Alleviating this assumption led to an extensive research to develop more suitable modeling techniques."

      "text" : "Conventionally, N-gram related LMs have not been built to capture long linguistic dependencies, although significant word triggering information is still available for large contexts. To illustrate such triggering correlations spread over a large context, we use correlation defined over a distance d, given by cd(w1, w2) =\nPd(w1,w2) P (w1)P (w2) . A value greater than 1 shows that it is more likely that the word w1 follows w2 at a distance d than expected without the occurrence ofw2. In Figure 1, we show the variation of this correlation for pronouns with the distance d. It can be observed that seeing another “he” about twenty words after having seen a first “he” is much more likely. A similar observation can be made for the word “she”. It is, however, surprising that seeing “he” after “he” is three times more likely than seeing “she” after “she”, so “he” is much more predictive. In the cases of cross-word triggering of “he”→ “she” and “she”→ “he”, we find that the correlation is suppressed in comparison to the same word triggering for distances larger than three. In summary, Figure 1 demonstrates that word triggering information exists at large distances, even up to one thousand words. These conclusions were confirmed by similar correlation experiments that we conducted\nfor different types of words and triggering relations.\nIn order to model this long-term correlation and overcome the restrictive Markov assumption, recurrent language models have been proposed to approximate (1) according to\np(wT1 ) ≈ T∏ t=1 p(wt|wt−1, ht−1) = T∏ t=1 p(wt|ht) (3)\nIn NN-based recurrent models, ht is a context vector which represents the complete history, and modeled as a hidden state that evolves within the network."

The goal of these models is to learn the various constraints, both local and global, that are present in a language. This is typically done using two different models, which separately learn the local and global context, and then combine their resulting linguistic information to perform the word prediction. For instance, Bellegarda (1998b) proposed to use Latent Semantics Analysis (LSA) to capture the global context, and then combine it with the standard N -gram models, which capture the local context, whereas Mikolov and Zweig (2012) proposed to model the global topic information using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which is then combined with an RNN-based LM. This idea is not particular to language modeling but has been also used in other Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, e.g., Anastasakos et al.

In doing so, the resulting Long-Short Range Context (LSRC) network is able to separately model the\nshort/long context while it dynamically combines them to perform the next word prediction task. Formally, this new model is defined as\nH lt = f ( Xt−1 + U c l ·H lt−1 ) (11)\n{i, f, o}t = σ ( V i,f,ol ·H l t + V i,f,o g ·H g t−1 ) (12)\nC̃t = f ( V cl ·H lt + V cg ·H g t−1 ) (13)\nCt = ft Ct−1 + it C̃t (14) Hgt = ot f (Ct) (15) Pt = g (W ·Hgt ) (16)\nLearning of an LSRC model requires the training of the local parameters V i,f,o,cl and U c l , the global parameters V i,f,o,cg and the hidden-to-output connection weightsW . This can be done using the standard Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm, which is typically used to train recurrent networks.\nThe proposed approach uses two hidden states, namely, H lt and H g t to model short and long range context, respectively. More particularly, the local state H lt evolves according to (11) which is nothing but a simple recurrent model as it is defined in (4). In doing so, H lt is expected to have a similar behavior to RNN, which has been shown to capture local/short context (up to 10 words), whereas the global state Hgt follows the LSTM model, which is known to capture longer dependencies (see example in Figure 5). The main difference here, however, is the dependence of the network modules (gates and memory candidate) on the previous local state H lt instead of the last seen word Xt−1. This model is based on the assumption that the local context carries more linguistic information, and is therefore, more suitable to combine with the global context and update LSTM, compared to the last seen word. Figure 4 illustrates the recurrent module of an LSRC network. It is worth mentioning that this model was not particularly developed to separately learn syntactic and semantic information. This may come, however, as a result of the inherent local and global nature of these two types of linguistic properties."

      "text" : "For many NLP applications, capturing the global context information can be a crucial component to develop successful systems. This is mainly due to\nthe inherent nature of languages, where a single idea or topic can span over few sentences, paragraphs or a complete document. LSA-like approaches take advantage of this property, and aim at extracting some hidden “concepts” that best explain the data in a lowdimension “semantic space”. To some extent, the hidden layer of LSRC/LSTM can be seen as a vector in a similar space. The information stored in this vector, however, changes continuously based on the processed words. Moreover, interpreting its content is generally difficult. As an alternative, measuring the temporal correlation of this hidden vector can be used as an indicator of the ability of the network to model short and long context dependencies. Formally, the temporal correlation of a hidden state H over a distance d is given by\ncd = 1\nD t=D∑ t=1 SM(Ht, Ht+d) (17)\nwhere D is the test data size in words and SM is a similarity measure such as the cosine similarity. This measure allows us to evaluate how fast does the information stored in the hidden state change over time.\nIn Figure 5, we show the variation of this temporal correlation for the local and global states of the proposed LSRC network in comparison to RNN and LSTM for various values of the distance d (up to 3000). This figure was obtained on the test set of the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus, described in Section (4). The main conclusion we can draw from this figure is the ability of the LSRC local and global\nstates (trained jointly) to behave in a similar fashion to RNN and LSTM states (trained separately), respectively. We can also conclude that the LSRC global state and LSTM are able to capture long range correlations, whereas the context changes rapidly over time in RNN and LSRC local state."

For short (fixed) size context models, we compare our method to 1) the FFNNbased LM (Bengio et al., 2003), as well as 2) the Fixed-size Ordinally Forgetting Encoding (FOFE) approach, which is implemented in (Zhang et al., 2015) as a sentence-based model.

In order to investigate the impact of deep models on the LSRC architecture, we added a single hidden, non-recurrent layer (of size 400 for PTB and 600 for the LTCB experiments) to the LSRC model (D-LSRC). This was sufficient to improve the performance with a negligible increase in the number of model parameters."

We also use the same learning setup adopted in (Zhang et al., 2015). Namely, we use the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with a mini-batch size of 200, the learning rate is initialized to 0.4, the momentum is set to 0.9, the weight decay is fixed at 4×10−5, whereas the training is done in epochs. The weights initialization follows the normalized initialization proposed in (Glorot and Bengio, 2010). Similarly to (Mikolov et al., 2010), the learning rate is halved when no significant improvement of the validation data log-likelihood is observed. Then, we continue with seven more epochs while halving the learning rate after each epoch.\nRegarding the recurrent models, we use f = tanh(·) as activation function for all recurrent layers, whereas ”f = sigmoid(·)” is used for the input, forget and output gates of LSTM and LSRC. The additional non-recurrent layer in D-LSRC, however, uses the ReLu activation function. The word embedding size was set to 200 for LSTM and LSRC whereas it is the same as the hidden layer size for RNN (result of the RNN equation 4). In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the LSRC model, we also report the results when the embedding size is fixed at 100, LSRC(100). The training uses the BPTT algorithm for 5 time steps. Similarly to short context models, the mini-batch was set to 200. The learning rate, however, was set to 1.0 and the weight decay to 5 × 10−5. The use of momentum did not lead to any additional improvement. Moreover, the data is processed sequentially without any sentence independence assumption. Thus, the recurrent mod-\nels will be able to capture long range dependencies that exist beyond the sentence boundary.\nIn order to compare the model sizes, we also report the Number of Parameters (NoP) to train for each of the models above.\nTable 2 shows the perplexity evaluation on the PTB test set. As a first observation, we can clearly see that the proposed approach outperforms all other models for all configurations, in particular, RNN and LSTM. This observation includes other models that were reported in the literature, such as random forest LM (Xu and Jelinek, 2007), structured LM (Filimonov and Harper, 2009) and syntactic neural network LM (Emami and Jelinek, 2004). More particularly, we can conclude that LSRC, with an embedding size of 100, achieves a better performance than all other models while reducing the number of parameters by ≈ 29% and ≈ 17% compared to RNN and LSTM, respectively. Increasing the embedding size to 200, which is used by the other models, improves significantly the performance with a resulting NoP comparable to LSTM. The significance of the improvements obtained here over LSTM were confirmed through a statistical significance t-test, which\nled to p-values ≤ 10−10 for a significance level of 5% and 0.01%, respectively.\nThe results of the deep models in Table 2 also show that adding a single non-recurrent hidden layer to LSRC can significantly improve the performance. In fact, the additional layer bridges the gap between the LSRC models with an embedding size of 100 and 200, respectively. The resulting architectures outperform the other deep recurrent models with a significant reduction of the number of parameters (for the embedding size 100), and without usage of dropout regularization, Lp and maxout units or gradient control techniques compared to the deep RNN4(D-RNN).\nWe can conclude from these experiments that the explicit modeling of short and long range dependencies using two separate hidden states improves the performance while significantly reducing the number of parameters.\nIn order to show the consistency of the LSRC improvement over the other recurrent models, we report the variation of the models performance with respect to the hidden layer size in Figure 6. This figure shows that increasing the LSTM or RNN hidden layer size could not achieve a similar performance to the one obtained using LSRC with a small layer size (e.g., 300). It is also worth mentioning that this observation holds when comparing a 2-recurrent layers LSTM to LSRC with an additional non-recurrent layer."

We also report results for an LSTM with 2 recurrent layers as well as for LSRC with an additional non-recurrent layer. The recurrent layers are marked with an “R” in Table 3.\nThe results shown in Table 3 generally confirm the conclusions we drew from the PTB experiments above. In particular, we can see that the proposed LSRC model largely outperforms all other models. In particular, LSRC clearly outperforms LSTM with a negligible increase in the number of parameters (resulting from the additional 200 × 200 = 0.04M local connection weights U cl ) for the single layer results. We can also see that this improvement is maintained for deep models (2 hidden layers), where the LSRC model achieves a slightly better performance while reducing the number of parameters by ≈ 2.5M and speeding up the training time by ≈ 20% compared to deep LSTM.\nThe PTB and LTCB results clearly highlight the\nimportance of recurrent models to capture long range dependencies for LM tasks. The training of these models, however, requires large amounts of data to significantly outperform short context models. This can be seen in the performance of RNN and LSTM in the PTB and LTCB tables above.
