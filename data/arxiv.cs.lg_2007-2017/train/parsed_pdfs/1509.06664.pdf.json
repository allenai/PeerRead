      "text" : "The ability to determine the semantic relationship between two sentences is an integral part of machines that understand and reason with natural language. Recognizing textual entailment (RTE) is the task of determining whether two natural language sentences are (i) contradicting each other, (ii) not related, or whether (iii) the first sentence (called premise) entails the second sentence (called hypothesis). This task is important since many natural language processing (NLP) problems, such as information extraction, relation extraction, text summarization or machine translation, rely on it explicitly or implicitly and could benefit from more accurate RTE systems [Dagan et al., 2006].\nState-of-the-art systems for RTE so far relied heavily on engineered NLP pipelines, extensive manual creation of features, as well as various external resources and specialized subcomponents such as negation detection [see for example Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014, Jimenez et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2014, Beltagy et al., 2015]. In contrast, end-to-end differentiable neural architectures failed to get close to acceptable performance due to the lack of large high-quality RTE datasets. An end-to-end differentiable solution to RTE is desirable, since it avoids specific assumptions about the underlying language. In particular, there is no need for language features like part-of-speech tags or dependency parses. Furthermore, a generic sequence-to-sequence solution allows to extend the concept of capturing entailment across any sequential data, not only natural language.\nRecently, Bowman et al. [2015] published the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) corpus accompanied by a neural network with long short-term memory units [LSTM, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997], which achieves an accuracy of 77.6% for RTE on this dataset. It is the first time a generic neural model without hand-crafted features got close to the accuracy of classifier with\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n06 66\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 Se\nengineered features for RTE. This can be explained by the high quality and size of SNLI compared to the two orders of magnitude smaller and partly synthetic datasets so far used to evaluate RTE systems. Bowman et al.’s LSTM encodes the premise and hypothesis as dense fixed-length vectors whose concatenation is subsequently used in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification. In contrast, we are proposing an attentive neural network that is capable of reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases by processing the hypothesis conditioned on the premise.\nOur contributions are threefold: (i) We present a neural model based on LSTMs that reads two sentences in one go to determine entailment, as opposed to mapping each sentence independently into a semantic space (§2.2), (ii) We extend this model with a neural word-by-word attention mechanism to encourage reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases (§2.4), and (iii) We provide a detailed qualitative analysis of neural attention for RTE (§4.1). Our benchmark LSTM achieves an accuracy of 80.9% on SNLI, outperforming a classifier with hand-crafted lexical features tailored to RTE by 2.7 percentage points. An extension with word-by-word neural attention surpasses this strong benchmark LSTM result by 2.6 percentage points, setting a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.5% for recognizing entailment on SNLI."

LSTMs encompass memory cells that can store information for a long period of time, as well as three types of gates that control the flow of information into and out of these cells: input gates (Eq. 2), forget gates (Eq. 3) and output gates (Eq. 4). Given an input vector xt at time step t, the previous output ht−1 and cell state ct−1, an LSTM with hidden size k computes the next output ht and cell state ct as\nH =\n[ xt\nht−1\n] (1)\nit = σ(W iH+ bi) (2)\nft = σ(W fH+ bf ) (3)\not = σ(W oH+ bo) (4)\nct = ft ct−1 + it tanh(WcH+ bc) (5) ht = ot tanh(ct) (6)\nwhere Wi,Wf ,Wo,Wc ∈ R2k×k are trained matrices and bi,bf ,bo,bc ∈ Rk trained biases that parameterize the gates and transformations of the input, σ denotes the element-wise application of the sigmoid function and the element-wise multiplication of two vectors."

      "text" : "LSTMs can readily be used for RTE by independently encoding the premise and hypothesis as dense vectors and taking their concatenation as input to an MLP classifier [Bowman et al., 2015]. This demonstrates that LSTMs can learn semantically rich sentence representations that are suitable for determining textual entailment.\nIn contrast to learning sentence representations, we are interested in neural models that read both sentences to determine entailment, thereby reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Figure 1 shows the high-level structure of this model. The premise (left) is read by an LSTM (A). A second LSTM with different parameters is reading a delimiter and the hypothesis (right), but its memory state is initialized with the last cell state of the previous LSTM (c5 in the example). We use word2vec vectors [Mikolov et al., 2013] as word representations, which we do not optimize\nduring training. Out-of-vocabulary words in the training set are randomly initialized by sampling values uniformly from (−0.05, 0.05) and optimized during training.1 Out-of-vocabulary words encountered at inference time on the validation and test corpus are set to fixed random vectors. By not tuning representations of words for which we have word2vec vectors, we ensure that at inference time their representation stays close to unseen similar words for which we have word2vec embeddings. We use a linear layer to project word vectors to the dimensionality of the hidden size of the LSTM, yielding input vectors xi. Finally, for classification we use a softmax layer over the output of a non-linear projection of the last output vector (h9 in the example) into the target space of the three classes (ENTAILMENT, NEUTRAL or CONTRADICTION), and train using the cross-entropy loss."

      "heading" : "2.3 Attention",
      "text" : "Attentive neural networks have recently demonstrated success in a wide range of tasks ranging from handwriting synthesis [Graves, 2013], machine translation [Bahdanau et al., 2014], digit classification [Mnih et al., 2014], image captioning [Xu et al., 2015], speech recognition [Chorowski et al., 2015] and sentence summarization [Rush et al., 2015], to geometric reasoning [Vinyals et al., 2015]. The idea is to allow the model to attend over past output vectors (see Figure 1 B), thereby mitigating the LSTM’s cell state bottleneck. More precisely, an LSTM with attention for RTE does not need to capture the whole semantics of the premise in its cell state. Instead, it is sufficient to output vectors while reading the premise and accumulating a representation in the cell state that informs the second LSTM which of the output vectors of the premise it needs to attend over to determine the RTE class.\nLet Y ∈ Rk×L be a matrix consisting of output vectors [h1 · · · hL] that the first LSTM produced when reading the L words of the premise, where k is a hyperparameter denoting the size of embeddings and hidden layers. Furthermore, let eL ∈ RL be a vector of 1s and hN be the last output vector after the premise and hypothesis was processed by the two LSTMs respectively. The attention mechanism will produce a vector α of attention weights and a weighted representation r of the premise via\nM = tanh(WyY +WhhN ⊗ eL) M ∈ Rk×L (7) α = softmax(wTM) α ∈ RL (8) r = YαT r ∈ Rk (9)\nwhere Wy,Wh ∈ Rk×k are trained projection matrices, w ∈ Rk is a trained parameter vector and wT its transpose. Note that the outer product WhhN ⊗eL is repeating the linearly transformed hN as many times as there are words in the premise. Hence, the intermediate attention representation mi\n1We found 12.1k words in SNLI for which we could not obtain word2vec embeddings, resulting in 3.65M tunable parameters.\n(ith column vector in M) of the ith word in the premise is obtained from a non-linear combination of the premise’s output vector hi (ith column vector in Y) and the transformed hN . The attention weight for the ith word in the premise is the result of a weighted combination (parameterized by w) of values in mi. We obtain the final sentence-pair representation used for classification from\nh∗ = tanh(Wpr+WxhN ) h ∗ ∈ Rk (10)"

      "text" : "For determining whether one sentence entails another it can be a good strategy to check for entailment or contradiction of individual aligned word- and phrase-pairs. To encourage such behavior we employ neural word-by-word attention similar to Bahdanau et al. [2014], Hermann et al. [2015] and Rush et al. [2015]. The difference is that we do not use attention to generate words, but to obtain a sentence-pair encoding from fine-grained reasoning via soft-alignment of words and phrases in the premise and hypothesis. In our case, this amounts to attending over the first LSTM’s output vectors of the premise while the second LSTM processes the hypothesis one word at a time, thus generating attention weights αt over all output vectors of the premise for every word xt in the hypothesis (Figure 1 C). This can be modeled as follows:\nMt = tanh(W yY + (Whht +W rrt−1)⊗ eL) Mt ∈ RL×k (11) αt = softmax(wTMt) αt ∈ RL (12) rt = Yα T t + tanh(W trt−1) rt ∈ Rk (13)\nThe final sentence-pair representation is obtained from the last attention-weighted representation rL of the premise and the last output vector hN using\nh∗ = tanh(WprL +W xhN ) h ∗ ∈ Rk (14)"

The idea is simply to use the same model that attends over the premise conditioned on the hypothesis to also attend over the hypothesis conditioned on the premise by swapping the two sequences. This produces two sentencepair representations that we concatenate for classification."

This corpus is two orders of magnitude larger than other existing RTE corpora such as Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge [SICK, Marelli et al., 2014]. Furthermore, a large part of training examples in SICK were generated heuristically from other examples. In contrast, all sentence-pairs in SNLI stem from human annotators. The size and quality of SNLI make it a suitable resource for training neural architectures such as the ones proposed in this paper.\nWe use ADAM [Kingma and Ba, 2014] for optimization with a first momentum coefficient of 0.9 and a second momentum coefficient of 0.999.2 For every model we perform a small grid search over combinations of the initial learning rate [1E-4, 3E-4, 1E-3], dropout3 [0.0, 0.1, 0.2] and `2- regularization strength [0.0, 1E-4, 3E-4, 1E-3]. Subsequently, we take the best configuration based on performance on the validation set, and evaluate only that configuration on the test set."

      "heading" : "4 Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "Results on the SNLI corpus are summarized in Table 1. The total number of model parameters, including tunable word representations, is denoted by |θ|W+M (without word representations |θ|M).\n2Standard configuration recommended by Kingma and Ba. 3As in Zaremba et al. [2014], we apply dropout only on the inputs and outputs of the network.\nTo ensure a comparable number of parameters to Bowman et al.’s model that encodes the premise and hypothesis independently but with one LSTM, we also run experiments with a single LSTM (“shared” with k = 100) as opposed to two different LSTMs that read the premise and hypothesis respectively. In addition, we compare our attentive models to two benchmark LSTMs whose hidden sizes were chosen so that they have at least as many parameters as the attentive models. Since we are not tuning word vectors for which we have word2vec embeddings, the total number of parameters |θ|W+M of our models is considerably smaller. We also compare our models against the benchmark classifier used by Bowman et al., which constructs features from the BLEU score between the premise and hypothesis, length difference, word overlap, uni- and bigrams, part-of-speech tags, as well as cross uni- and bigrams.\nLSTM We found that processing the hypothesis conditioned on the premise instead of encoding each sentence independently gives an improvement of 3.3 percentage points in accuracy over Bowman et al.’s LSTM. We argue this is due to information being able to flow from one sentence representation to the other. Specifically, the model does not waste capacity on encoding the hypothesis (in fact it does not need to encode the hypothesis at all), but can read the hypothesis in a more focused way by checking words and phrases for contradictions and entailments based on the semantic representation of the premise. One interpretation is that the LSTM is approximating a finite-state automaton for RTE [c.f. Angeli and Manning, 2014]. Another difference to Bowman et al.’s model is that we are using word2vec instead of GloVe and, more importantly, do not fine-tune these word embeddings. The drop in accuracy from train to test set is less severe for our models, which suggest that fine-tuning word embeddings could be a cause of overfitting.\nOur LSTM outperforms a feature-engineered classifier by 2.7 percentage points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a neural end-to-end differentiable model to achieve state-ofthe-art performance on a textual entailment dataset.\nAttention With attention we found a 0.9 percentage point improvement over a single LSTM with a hidden size of 159, and a 1.4 percentage point increase over a benchmark model that uses two LSTMs (one for the premise and one for the hypothesis). The attention model produces output vectors summarizing contextual information of the premise that is useful to attend over later when reading the hypothesis. Therefore, when reading the premise, the model does not have to build up a semantic representation of the whole premise, but instead a representation that helps attending over the right output vectors when processing the hypothesis. In contrast, the output vectors of the premise are not used by the benchmark LSTMs. Thus, these models have to build up a representation of the premise and carry it over through the cell state to the part that processes the hypothesis—a bottleneck that can be overcome to some degree by using attention.\nWord-by-word Attention Enabling the model to attend over output vectors of the premise for each word in the hypothesis yields another 1.2 percentage point improvement compared to attending conditioned only on the last output vector of the premise. We argue that this is due to the model being able to check for entailment or contradiction of individual words in the hypothesis, and demonstrate this effect in the qualitative analysis below.\nTwo-way Attention Allowing the model to also attend over the hypothesis based on the premise does not seem to improve performance on RTE. We suspect that this is due to entailment being an asymmetric relation. Hence, using the same LSTM to encode the hypothesis (in one direction) and the premise (in the other direction) might lead to noise in the training signal. This could be addressed by training different LSTMs at the cost of doubling the number of model parameters."

      "heading" : "4.1 Qualitative Analysis",
      "text" : "It is instructive to analyze which output representations the model is attending over when deciding the class of an RTE example. Note that interpretations based on attention weights have to be taken with care since the model is not forced to solely rely on representations obtained from attention (see Eq. 10 and 14). In the following we visualize and discuss the attention patterns of the presented attentive models. For each attentive model we hand-picked examples from ten samples of the validation set.\nAttention Figure 2 shows to what extent the attentive model focuses on contextual representations of the premise after both LSTMs processed the premise and hypothesis respectively. Note how the model pays attention to output vectors of words that are semantically coherent with the premise (“riding” and “rides”, “animal” and “camel”, 2a) or in contradiction, as caused by a single word (“blue” vs. “pink”, 2b) or multiple words (“swim” and “lake” vs. “frolicking” and “grass”, 2c). Interestingly, the model shows contextual understanding by not attending over “yellow”, the color of the toy, but “pink”, the color of the coat. However, for more involved examples with longer premises we found that attention is more uniformly distributed (2d). This suggests that conditioning attention only on the last output has limitations when multiple words need to be considered for deciding the RTE class.\nWord-by-word Attention Visualizations of word-by-word attention are depicted in Figure 3. We found that word-by-word attention can easily detect if the hypothesis is simply a reordering of words in the premise (3a). Furthermore, it is able to resolve synonyms (“airplane” and “aircraft”, 3c) and capable of matching multi-word expressions to single words (“garbage can” to “trashcan”, 3b). It is also noteworthy that irrelevant parts of the premise, such as words capturing little meaning or whole uninformative relative clauses, are correctly neglected for determining entailment (“which also has a rope leading out of it”, 3b).\nWord-by-word attention seems to also work well when words in the premise and hypothesis are connected via deeper semantics or common-sense knowledge (“snow” can be found “outside” and a\n“mother” is an “adult”, 3e and 3g). Furthermore, the model is able to resolve one-to-many relationships (“kids” to “boy” and “girl”, 3d)\nAttention can fail, for example when the two sentences and their words are entirely unrelated (3f). In such cases, the model seems to back up to attending over function words, and the sentence-pair representation is likely dominated by the last output vector (see Eq. 14)."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we show how the state-of-the-art in recognizing textual entailment on a large, humancurated and annotated corpus, can be improved with general end-to-end differentiable models. Our results demonstrate that LSTM recurrent neural networks that read pairs of sequences to produce a final representation from which a simple classifier predicts entailment, outperform both a neural baseline as well as a classifier with hand-engineered features. Furthermore, extending these models with attention over the premise provides further improvements to the predictive abilities of the system, resulting in a new state-of-the-art accuracy for recognizing entailment on the Stanford Natural Language Inference corpus.\nThe models presented here are general sequence models, requiring no appeal to natural language specific processing beyond tokenization, and are therefore a suitable target for transfer learning through pre-training the recurrent systems on other corpora, and conversely, applying the models trained on this corpus to other entailment tasks. Future work will focus on such transfer learning tasks, as well as scaling the methods presented here to larger units of text (e.g. paragraphs and entire documents) using hierarchical attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the application of these generic models to non-natural language sequential entailment problems."

End-to-end differentiable neural architectures have failed to approach state-of-the-art performance until very recently. In this paper, we propose a neural model that reads two sentences to determine entailment using long short-term memory units. We extend this model with a word-by-word neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of attention weights produced by this model, demonstrating such reasoning capabilities. On a large entailment dataset this model outperforms the previous best neural model and a classifier with engineered features by a substantial margin. It is the first generic end-to-end differentiable system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a textual entailment dataset.",
