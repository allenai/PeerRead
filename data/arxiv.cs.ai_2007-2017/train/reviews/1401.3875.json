Like many other real-world applications, this complex domain requires high-speed autonomous decision-making and robust continual operation. To our knowledge, this work represents the first successful industrial application of embedded domain-independent temporal planning. Our system handles execution failures and multi-objective preferences. At its heart is an on-line algorithm that combines techniques from state-space planning and partial-order scheduling. We suggest that this general architecture may prove useful in other applications as more intelligent systems operate in continual, on-line settings. Our system has been used to drive several commercial prototypes and has enabled a new product architecture for our industrial partner. When compared with state-of-the-art off-line planners, our system is hundreds of times faster and often finds better plans. Our experience demonstrates that domain-independent AI planning based on heuristic search can flexibly handle time, resources, replanning, and multiple objectives in a high-speed practical application without requiring hand-coded control knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:10:17 GMT  (1176kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3875v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["wheeler ruml", "minh binh do", "rong zhou", "markus p j fromherz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3875"}
