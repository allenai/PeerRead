We set the experiment to simulate virtual drift, real drift, and hybrid drift event and we demonstrated how our CNNELM adaptability works. Our proposed method works well and gives better accuracy, computation scalability, and concept drifts adaptability compared to the regular ELM and CNN.

      "text" : "Online data stream learning is an emerging research area that has shown its importance in big data era. The big volumes of data are continuously generated from devices, softwares, and Internet, with higher incoming rate and no time bound. Knowledge mining over them needs special machine learning techniques to learn large volumes of data in a timely fashion. The techniques also need to be scalable for deployment in the big online real-time scenario (computationally tractable for processing large data streams) and capable to overcome uncertainty in the data representations.\nThe techniques, to offer an adaptive framework which adapts to any issue in which the data concepts do not follow static assumptions (known as concept drift\n1/28\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n02 34\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 O\nct 2\nproblem [7,29]). In concept drift (CD), the input and/or output concepts has non stationary and uncertain data distribution. The uncertainties can be perceived by the increase of class overlapping or additional comprehensive features in the feature space, which makes a deterioration of classifiers.\nThe aim of CD handling [7] is to boost the generalization accuracy when the drift occurs. Common handling methods are based on classifier ensemble [5]. Ensemble methods combined decision from each classifier members (mainly using ensemble members diversification). However, ensemble methods are difficult to manage complexities when handling many types of consecutive drifts [3, 20,21,45].\nOne of the recent online big stream data approaches are based on Deep Learning (DL) techniques [1]. They offer promising avenue of automated feature extraction of big data in streaming approaches. The Deep Learning has many variants such as a Deep Belief Network (DBN) by Hinton [11], Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) by Salakhutdinov and Hinton, [34], Stacked Denoising Autoencoders (SDA) by Vincent [39], and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) by LeCun [22], and many others.\nThe traditional machine learning methods i.e. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP NN), Hidden Markov Model (HMM) may not be able to handle such big stream data directly [31] although they worked successfully in classification problem in many areas. The shallow methods need a good feature representation and assume all data available. Feature engineering focused on constructing features as an essential element of machine learning. However, when the data is rapidly growing within dynamic assumptions such as CD, the handy-crafted feature engineering is very difficult and the traditional methods need to be modified. The popular approach combines Deep Learning method as unsupervised feature representation learner with any supervised classifier from traditional machine learning methods.\nIn this paper, we proposed a new adaptive scheme of integration between CNN [8,22,43] and ELM [13,16,17] to handle concept drift in online big stream data. We named it Adaptive CNN-ELM (ACNNELM). We studied ACNNELM scheme for concept drift either changes in the number of feature inputs named virtual drift (VD) or the number of classes named real drift (RD) or consecutive drift when VD and RD occurred at the same time named hybrid drift (HD) [3] in recurrent context (all concepts occur alternately).\nWe developed ACNNELM based on our previous work on adaptive ELM scheme named Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) that works as single ELM classifier for CD handling [2, 3]. As single classifier, AOS-ELM combines simultaneously many strategies to solve many types of CD in simple platform.\nAs our main contributions in this research area, we proposed two models of adaptive hybrid CNN and ELM as follows.\n1. ACNNELM-1: the adaptive scheme for integrating CNN and ELM to handle concept drift in classifier level;\n2. ACNNELM-2: the concatenation aggregation ensemble of integrating CNN and ELM classifiers to boost the performance and to handle concept drift for adaptivity in ensemble level.\nSection 1 gives introduction and research objectives. We describe related works in Section 2. Section 3 describes our proposed methods. We focus on the empirical experiments to prove the methods in MNIST and not-MNIST image classification task in Section 4. Section 5 discusses conclusions, challenges, and future directions.\n2/28"

      "text" : "Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) works based on generalized pseudoinverse for non iterative learning in single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) architecture [13,16,17]. Compared with Neural Networks (NN) including CNN, ELM and NN used random value parameters. However, ELM used set and fixed random value in hidden nodes parameters and used non iterative generalized pseudoinverse optimization process, while NN used iterative gradient descent optimization process to smooth the weight parameters.\nThe ELM learning objective is to get Output weight (β), where\nβ̂ = H†T (1)\nwhich H† is Pseudoinverse (Moore-Penrose generalized inverse) of H. The ELM\nlearning is simply equivalent to find the smallest least-squares solution for β̂ of the linear system Hβ = T when the Output weight β̂ = H†T.\nHidden layer matrix H is computed using activation function g of the summation matrix from the hidden nodes parameter (input weight a and bias b) with training input x with size N number of training data and L number of hidden nodes g(ai · x + bi) (feature mapping).\n3/28\nTo solve H†, ELM used orthogonal projection based on ridge regression method, where a positive 1/λ value is added as regularization to the auto correlation matrices HTH or HHT . We can solve Eq. 1 as follows.\nβ =\n( I\nλ + HTH\n)−1 HTT (2)\nELM has capability to learn online stream data (data comes one by one or by block with fixed or varying quantity) by solving HTH or HHT by following two methods:\n1. Sequential series using block matrices inverse.\nA Fast and Accurate Online Sequential named online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) [26] has sequential learning phase. In sequential learning, the\nβ(k) computed as the previous β(k−1) function. If we have β̂(0) from H(0) filled by the N0 as initial training data and H(1) filled by N1 incremental training data, then the output weights β̂(1) are approximated by solving:\n([ H(0) H(1) ]T [ H(0) H(1) ])−1 [ H(0) H(1) ]T [ T(0) T(1) ] (3)\nThe OS-ELM assumes no changes in the hidden nodes number. However, increasing the hidden nodes number may improve the performance named Constructive Enhancement OS-ELM [18].\n2. Parallelization using MapReduce framework.\nAnother approach is Elastic Extreme Learning Machine (E2LM) [40] or Parallel ELM [10] based on MapReduce framework to solve large sequential training data in a parallel way. First, Map is the transform process of intermediate matrix multiplications for each training data portion. Second, Reduce is the aggregate process to sum the Map result.\nIf U = HTH and V = HTT, we have decomposable matrices in k time sequences and can be written as :\nU = k=∞∑ k=0 U(k) (4)\nV = k=∞∑ k=0 V(k) (5)\nFinally, The corresponding output weights β can be obtained with centralized computing using result from reduce/aggregate process. Therefore, E2LM learning is efficient for rapidly massive training data set [40].\nβ =\n( I\nλ + U\n)−1 V (6)\nE2LM is more computing efficient, better performance and support parallel computation than OS-ELM [40], but E2LM did not address the possibility for hidden nodes increased during the training. OS-ELM, CEOS-ELM, E2LM, and Parallel ELM method did not address concept drift issues; i.e., when the number of attributes d in\n4/28\nXd×N or the number of classes m in TN ×m in data set has changed. We categorized OS-ELM, CEOS-ELM, E2LM , and Parallel ELM as non-adaptive sequential ELM.\nIn this paper, we developed parallelization framework to integrate with CNN to solve concept drift issues in sequential learning as enhancement from our previous work Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) [3]."

      "text" : "Different with SLFN in ELM, a CNN consists of some convolution and sub-sampling layers in feed forward architecture. CNN is the first successful deep architecture that keep the characteristics of the traditional NN. CNN has excellent performance for spatial visual classification [36]. The key benefit of CNN comparing with another deep learning methods are using fewer parameters [43].\nAt the end of CNN layer, it is followed by fully connected standard multilayer neural network (See Fig. 1) [43]. Many variants of CNN architectures in the literature, but the basic common building blocks are convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully connected layer [8].\nThe CNN input layer is designed to exploit the 2D structure with d× d× r of image where d is the height and width of image, and r is the number of channels, (i.e. gray scale image has r=1 and RGB image has r=3). The convolutional layer has c filters (or kernels) of size k × k × q where k < d and q can either be the same as the number of channels r or smaller and may vary for each kernel. The filters have locally connected structure which is each convolved with the image to produce c feature maps of size d− k + 1 (Convolution operations) .\nEach map from convolutional layer is then pooled using either down sampling, mean or max sampling over s× s× s contiguous regions (s ranges between 2 for small and up to 5 for larger inputs). An additive bias and activation function (i.e. sigmoid, tanh, or reLU) can be applied to each feature map either before or after the pooling layer. At the end of the CNN layer, there may be any densely connected NN layers for supervised learning [43]. The learning errors are propagated back to the previous layers using optimization method to finally update the kernel weight parameters and bias.\nThe convolution operations are heavy computation but inherently parallel, which getting beneficial from a hardware parallel implementation [35]. Krizhevsky et. al. showed a large, deep CNN is capable of achieving record breaking results on a highly challenging dataset (the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes) using purely supervised learning. However, the CNN network size is still limited mainly by the amount of memory available on current GPUs [19].\n5/28"

Huang et. al. proposed ELM-LRF that has connections between input layer and hidden nodes are randomly generated following any continuous different types of probability distributions. According to Huang et. al. the random convolutional hidden nodes CNN is one type of local receptive fields. Different with CNN, ELM with LRF type hidden nodes keeps the essence of ELM for non iterative output weights calculation.\nPang et. al. [33] implemented deep convolutional ELM (DC-ELM). It uses multiple convolution layers and pooling layers for high level features abstraction from input images. Then, the abstracted features are classified by an ELM classifier. Pang et. al. did not use sequential learning approach. Their results give 98.43% for DC-ELM compared with 97.79% for ELM-LRF on MNIST regular 15K samples training data.\nGuo et. al. [9] introduced an integration model of CNN-ELM, and applied to handwritten digit recognition. Guo et. al. used CNN as an automatic feature extractor and ELM to replace the original classification layer of CNN. CNN-ELM achieved an error rate of 0.67% that is lower than CNN and ELM alone. Guo et. al. trained the original CNN until converged. The last layer of CNN was replaced by ELM to complete classification without iteration. The experiments used regular MNIST data set with size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image 28× 28 pixels. According to Guo et. al. numbers filters of different convolution layer have a significant influence on the generalization ability.\nLee et. al. [25] proposed an integration of CNN with OS-ELM. A learning method called an orthogonal bipolar vector (OBV) was also well applied by analyzing the neural networks learned by combining both algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can conduct network learning at a faster rate than conventional CNN. In addition, it can be used to solve the local minima and overfitting problems. The experiment used NORB dataset, MNIST handwritten digit standard dataset, and CIFAR-10 dataset.

      "text" : "The brief explanation of concept drift (CD) has been well introduced by Gama, et. al. [7] and Minku [29] based on Bayesian decision theory for class output c and incoming data X.\n6/28\nThe concept is the whole distribution (joint distribution P(X,c) in a certain time step. The CD represents any changes in the joint distribution when P (c|X) has changed; i.e., ∃X : P(0)(X, c) 6= P(1)(X, c), where P(0) and P(1) are respectively the joint distribution at time k(0) and k(1). The CD type has categorization as follows [6,7,12,37].\n1. Real Drift (RD) refers to changes in P (c|X). The change in P (c|X) may be caused by a change in the class boundary (the number of classes) or the class conditional probabilities (likelihood) P (X|c).\n2. Virtual Drift (VD) refers to the changes in the distribution of the incoming data (i.e., P (X) changes). These changes may be due to incomplete or partial feature representation of the current data distribution. The trained model is built with additional data from the same environment without overlapping the actual class boundaries.\nWe introduced the third category named Hybrid Drift (HD) when the RD and VD occurred consecutively. [3].\nEnsemble learning is the common approaches to tackle concept drift, in which are combined using a form of voting [38,45]. The ensemble approach can integrate the results of individual classifiers into a unified predicted result to improve the accuracy and robustness than single classifiers [42]. Yu , et. al. [41] proposed a general hybrid adaptive ensemble learning framework (See Fig. 3). Liu, et. al. [27] proposed an ensemble based ELM (EN-ELM) which uses the cross-validation scheme to build ELM classifiers ensemble.\nEach drift employed different solution strategies. The solution for RD is entirely different from VD. Certain CD requirement needs to replace entirely the outdated concept (concept replacement) either sudden or gradually, but another requirement needs to handle old and new concepts that come alternately (recurring concept). Thus,\n7/28\nit is hard to combine simultaneously many types and requirement of complex drift solutions, such as hybrid drift in a simple ensemble platform. The adaptive ensemble approach may be not practical and flexible if each member itself is not designed to be adaptive [3] and may need to recall the previous training data (not single pass learning [20]). Moreover, another simple approach is using single classifier [3, 28,30].\nMirza et. al. [30] proposed OS-ELM for imbalanced and concept drift tackling named meta-cognitive OS-ELM (MOS-ELM) that was developed based on Weighted OS-ELM (WOS-ELM) [46]. MOS-ELM used an additional weighting matrix to control the CD adaptivity, however, it works for RD with concept replacement only.\nOur previous AOS-ELM works as single unified solution for VD, RD, and HD. Also, it can be applied for concept replacement and recurring [3] by using simple matrix adjustment and multiplication. We explained AOS-ELM for each scenario as follows.\n1. Scenario 1: Virtual Drift (VD).\nAccording to interpolation theory from ELM point of view and Learning Principle I of ELM Theory [14], the input weight and bias as hidden nodes H parameters are independent of training samples and their learning environment through randomization. Their independence is not only in initial training stage but also in any sequential training stages. Thus, we can adjust the input weight and bias pair {ai,bi}Li=1 on any sequential stages and still have probability one that ‖Hβ −T‖ < to handle additional feature inputs.\nThe example implementation is when we need to combine from different type of training data set."

Further, Grachten et. al. categorized as follows.\n1. RESET: Initialize parameters with random values;\n2. RESET PRF: Combination between the prior regularization on convolutional filters (PRF) with the RESET option. PRF improves a bit the RESET baseline sometimes, and the gains are usually moderate;\n3. REUSE ALL: Initialize all parameters from prior model (except output layer);\n4. REUSE CF: Selectively reuse the prior model by keeping previous convolutional filters (CF) from the prior model.\nGrachten et. al. divided regular MNIST into two subsets (Data Set 1 from class 0 to 4, and Data Set 2 from class 5 to 9). The training set is 50000 data, 10000 data for\n9/28\nvalidation and 10000 testing data. The classifier used a CNN with a convolutional layer (32 feature maps using kernels size 5× 5, sigmoid activations and Dropout), followed by a max-pooling layer (2× 2 pool size). The classification stage used a fully connected layer (40 sigmoid units and 10 softmax units).\nZhang et. al. [44] proposed an adaptive CNN (ACNN), whose structure automatic expansion based on the average system error and training recognition rate performance. The incremental learning for new training data is handled by new branches addition while the original network keep unchanged. ACNN used the structure global expansion until meet the average error criteria and local expansion to expand the network structure. Zhang et. al. used ORL face database. The model has recognition rate increased from 91.67% to 93.33% using local expansion. However, Zhang et. al. did not discuss any concept drift handling.\nAccording to Zhang et. al. no such theory about how CNN structure constructed, i.e. the number of layers, the number of feature maps per layer. Researchers constructed and compared each CNN candidate performance for the best one. Some studies tried to use hardware acceleration to speed up the performance comparison discovery.

The dataset has been divided for 60,000 examples for training data and separated 10,000 examples for testing data [24]. However, to simulate big stream data, the regular MNIST is not adequate.

In this paper, we proposed the Adaptive Convolutional ELM method (ACNNELM) as enhancement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a hybrid Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model plus adaptive capability. This method is aimed for concept drift handling. We enhanced the CNN as convolutional hiererchical features representation learner combined with Elastic ELM (ELM) as a parallel supervised classifier. We propose an Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) for concept drift adaptability in classifier level (named ACNNELM-1) and matrices concatenation ensembles for concept drift adaptability in ensemble level (named ACNNELM-2). Our proposed Adaptive CNNELM is flexible that works well in classifier level and ensemble level while most current methods only proposed to work on either one of the levels. We verified our method in extended MNIST data set and not MNIST data set. We set the experiment to simulate virtual drift, real drift, and hybrid drift event and we demonstrated how our CNNELM adaptability works. Our proposed method works well and gives better accuracy, computation scalability, and concept drifts adaptability compared to the regular ELM and CNN. Further researches are still required to study the optimum parameters and to use more varied image data set.
