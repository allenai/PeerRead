      "text" : "Existing automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are based on a complicated hybrid of separate components, including acoustic, phonetic, and language models (Jelinek, 1976). Such systems are typically based on deep neural network acoustic models combined with hidden Markov models to represent the language and phonetic contextdependent state and their temporal alignment with the acoustic signal (DNN-HMM) (Bourlard & Morgan, 1994; Hinton et al., 2012). As a simpler alternative, end-to-end speech recognition paradigm has attracted great research\ninterest (Chorowski et al., 2014; 2015; Chan et al., 2016; Graves & Jaitly, 2014; Miao et al., 2015). This paradigm simplifies the above hybrid architecture by subsuming it into a single neural network. Specifically, an attentionbased encoder-decoder framework (Chorowski et al., 2014) integrates all of those components using a set of recurrent neural networks (RNN), which map from acoustic feature sequences to character label sequences.\nHowever, existing end-to-end frameworks have focused on clean speech, and do not include speech enhancement, which is essential to good performance in noisy environments. For example, recent industrial applications (e.g., Amazon echo) and benchmark studies (Barker et al., 2016; Kinoshita et al., 2016) show that multichannel speech enhancement techniques, using beamforming methods, produce substantial improvements as a pre-processor for conventional hybrid systems, in the presence of strong background noise. In light of the above trends, this paper extends the existing attention-based encoder-decoder framework by integrating multichannel speech enhancement. Our proposed multichannel end-to-end speech recognition framework is trained to directly translate from multichannel acoustic signals to text.\nA key concept of the multichannel end-to-end framework is to optimize the entire inference procedure, including the beamforming, based on the final ASR objectives, such as word/character error rate (WER/CER). Traditionally, beamforming techniques such as delay-and-sum and filterand-sum are optimized based on a signal-level loss function, independently of speech recognition task (Benesty et al., 2008; Van Veen & Buckley, 1988). Their use in ASR requires ad-hoc modifications such as Wiener post-filtering or distortionless constraints, as well as steering mechanisms determine a look direction to focus the beamformer on the target speech (Wölfel & McDonough, 2009). In contrast, our framework incorporates recently proposed neural beamforming mechanisms as a differentiable component to allow joint optimization of the multichannel speech\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n04 78\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 1\n4 M\nar 2\nenhancement within the end-to-end system to improve the ASR objective.\nRecent studies on neural beamformers can be categorized into two types: (1) beamformers with a filter estimation network (Xiao et al., 2016a; Li et al., 2016) and (2) beamformers with a mask estimation network (Heymann et al., 2016; Erdogan et al., 2016). Both methods obtain an enhanced signal based on the formalization of the conventional filter-and-sum beamformer in the time-frequency domain. The main difference between them is how the multichannel filters are produced by the neural network. In the former approach, the multichannel filter coefficients are direct outputs of the network. In the latter approach, a network first estimates time-frequency masks, which are used to compute expected speech and noise statistics. Then, using these statistics, the filter coefficients are computed based on the well-known MVDR (minimum variance distortionless response) formalization (Capon, 1969). In both approaches, the estimated filter coefficients are then applied to the multichannel noisy signal to enhance the speech signal. Note that the mask estimation approach has the advantage of leveraging well-known techniques, but it requires parallel data composed of aligned clean and noisy speech, which are usually difficult to obtain without data simulation.\nRecently, it has been reported that the mask estimationbased approaches (Yoshioka et al., 2015; Heymann et al., 2016; Erdogan et al., 2016) achieve great performance in noisy speech recognition benchmarks (e.g., CHiME 3 and 4 challenges)1. Although this paper proposes to incorporate both mask and filter estimation approaches in an endto-end framework, motivated by those successes, we focus more on the mask estimation, implementing it along with the MVDR estimation as a differentiable network. Our MVDR formulation estimates the speech image at the reference microphone and includes selection of the reference microphone using an attention mechanism. By using channel-independent mask estimation along with this reference selection, the model can generalize to different microphone array geometries (number of channels, microphone locations, and ordering), unlike the filter estimation approach. Finally, because the masks are latent variables in the end-to-end training, we no longer need parallel clean and noisy speech.\nThe main advantages of our proposed multichannel end-toend speech recognition system are:\n1. Overall inference from speech enhancement to recognition is jointly optimized for the ASR objective.\n1Yoshioka et al. 2015 uses a clustering technique to perform mask estimation rather than the neural network-based techniques, but it uses the same MVDR formulation for filter estimation.\n2. The trained system can be used for input signals with arbitrary number and order of channels.\n3. Parallel clean and noisy data are not required. We can optimize the speech enhancement component with noisy signals and their transcripts."

      "heading" : "2. Overview of attention-based encoder-decoder networks",
      "text" : "This section explains a conventional attention-based encoder-decoder framework, which is used to directly deal with variable length input and output sequences. The framework consists of two RNNs, called encoder and decoder respectively, and an attention mechanism, which connects the encoder and decoder, as shown in Figure 1. Given a T -length sequence of input features O = {ot ∈ RDO |t = 1, · · · , T}, the network generates an N -length sequence of output labels Y = {yn ∈ V|n = 1, · · · , N}, where ot is a DO-dimensional feature vector (e.g., log Mel filterbank) at input time step t, and yn is a label symbol (e.g., character) at output time step n in label set V .\nFirst, given an input sequence O, the encoder network transforms it to an L-length high-level feature sequence H = {hl ∈ RDH |l = 1, · · · , L}, where hl is a DHdimensional state vector at a time step l of encoder’s top layer. In this work, the encoder network is composed of a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) recurrent network. To reduce the input sequence length, we apply a subsampling technique (Bahdanau et al., 2016) to some layers. Therefore, l represents the frame index subsampled from t and L is less than T .\nNext, the attention mechanism integrates all encoder outputs H into a DH-dimensional context vector cn ∈ RDH\nbased on an L-dimensional attention weight vector an ∈ [0, 1]L, which represents a soft alignment of encoder outputs at an output time step n. In this work, we adopt a location-based attention mechanism (Chorowski et al., 2015), and an and cn are formalized as follows:\nfn = F ∗ an−1, (1) kn,l = w Ttanh(VSsn + V Hhl + V Ffn,l + b), (2)\nan,l = exp(αkn,l)∑L l=1 exp(αkn,l) , cn = L∑ l=1 an,lhl, (3)\nwhere w ∈ R1×DW , VH ∈ RDW×DH , VS ∈ RDW×DS , VF ∈ RDW×DF are trainable weight matrices, b ∈ RDW is a trainable bias vector, F ∈ RDF×1×Df is a trainable convolution filter. sn ∈ RDS is a DS-dimensional hidden state vector obtained from an upper decoder network at n, and α is a sharpening factor (Chorowski et al., 2015). ∗ denotes the convolution operation.\nThen, the decoder network incrementally updates a hidden state sn and generates an output label yn as follows:\nsn = Update(sn−1, cn−1, yn−1), (4) yn = Generate(sn, cn), (5)\nwhere the Generate(·) and Update(·) functions are composed of a feed forward network and an LSTM-based recurrent network, respectively.\nNow, we can summarize these procedures as follows: P (Y |O) = ∏ n P (yn|O, y1:n−1), (6)\nH = Encoder(O), (7) cn = Attention(an−1, sn, H), (8) yn = Decoder(cn, y1:n−1), (9)\nwhere Encoder(·) = BLSTM(·), Attention(·) corresponds to Eqs. (1)-(3), and Decoder(·) corresponds to Eqs. (4) and (5). Here, special tokens for start-of-sentence (sos) and end-of-sentence (eos) are added to the label set V . The decoder starts the recurrent computation with the (sos) label and continues to generate output labels until the (eos) label is emitted. Figure 1 illustrates such procedures.\nBased on the cross-entropy criterion, the loss function is defined using Eq. (6) as follows:\nL = − lnP (Y ∗|O) = − ∑ n lnP (y∗n|O, y∗1:n−1), (10)\nwhere Y ∗ is the ground truth of a whole sequence of output labels and y∗1:n−1 is the ground truth of its subsequence until an output time step n− 1.\nIn this framework, the whole networks including the encoder, attention, and decoder can be optimized to generate\nthe correct label sequence. This consistent optimization of all relevant procedures is the main motivation of the endto-end framework."

This paper uses frequency-domain beamformers rather than time-domain ones, which achieve significant computational complexity reduction in multichannel neural processing (Li et al., 2016; Sainath et al., 2016). In the frequency domain representation, a filter-and-sum beamformer obtains an enhanced signal as follows:\nx̂t,f = C∑ c=1 gt,f,cxt,f,c, (11)\nwhere xt,f,c ∈ C is an STFT coefficient of c-th channel noisy signal at a time-frequency bin (t, f). gt,f,c ∈ C is a corresponding beamforming filter coefficient. x̂t,f ∈ C is an enhanced STFT coefficient, and C is the numbers of channels.\nIn this paper, we adopt two types of neural beamformers, which basically follow Eq. (11); 1) filter estimation network and 2) mask estimation network. Figure 2 illustrates the schematic structure of each approach. The main difference between them is how to compute the filter coefficient gt,f,c. The following subsections describe each approach."

F is the dimension of STFT features.\nThis approach uses a single real-valued BLSTM network to predict the real and imaginary parts of the complex-valued filter coefficients at an every time step. Therefore, we introduce multiple (2 × C) output layers to separately compute the real and imaginary parts of the filter coefficients for each channel. Then, the network outputs time-variant filter coefficients gt,c = {gt,f,c}Ff=1 ∈ CF at a time step t for c-th channel as follows;\nZ = BLSTM({x̄t}Tt=1), (12) <(gt,c) = tanh(W<c zt + b<c ), (13) =(gt,c) = tanh(W=c zt + b=c ), (14)\nwhere Z = {zt ∈ RDZ |t = 1, · · · , T}is a sequence of DZdimensional output vectors of the BLSTM network. x̄t = {<(xt,f,c),=(xt,f,c)}F,Cf=1,c=1 ∈ R2FC is an input feature of a 2FC-dimensional real-value vector for the BLSTM network. This is obtained by concatenating the real and imaginary parts of all STFT coefficients in all channels. <(gt,c) and =(gt,c) is the real and imaginary part of filter coefficients, W<c ∈ RF×DZ and W=c ∈ RF×DZ are the weight matrices of the output layer for c-th channel, and b<c ∈ RF and b=c ∈ RF are their corresponding bias vectors. Using the estimated filters gt,c, the enhanced STFT coefficients x̂t,f are obtained based on Eq. (11).\nThis approach has several possible problems due to its formalization. The first issue is the high flexibility of the estimated filters {gt,f,c}T,F,Ct=1,f=1,c=1, which are composed of a large number of unconstrained variables (2TFC) estimated from few observations. This causes problems such as training difficulties and over-fitting. The second issue is that the network structure depends on the number and order of channels. Therefore, a new filter estimation network has to be trained when we change microphone configurations."

      "heading" : "4. Multichannel end-to-end ASR",
      "text" : "In this work, we propose a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition, which integrates all components with a single neural architecture. We adopt neural beamformers (Section 3) as a speech enhancement part, and the attention-based encoder-decoder (Section 2) as a speech recognition part.\nThe entire procedure to generate the sequence of output labels Ŷ from the multichannel inputs {Xc}Cc=1 is formalized as follows:\nX̂ = Enhance({Xc}Cc=1), (27) Ô = Feature(X̂), (28)\nĤ = Encoder(Ô), (29)\nĉn = Attention(ân−1, ŝn, Ĥ), (30) ŷn = Decoder(ĉn, ŷ1:n−1). (31)\nEnhance(·) is a speech enhancement function realized by the neural beamformer based on Eq. (11) with the filter or mask estimation network (Section 3.1 or 3.2).\nFeature(·) is a feature extraction function. In this work, we use a normalized log Mel filterbank transform to obtain\nôt ∈ RDO computed from the enhanced STFT coefficients x̂t ∈ CF as an input of attention-based encoder-decoder:\npt = {<(x̂t,f )2 + =(x̂t,f )2}Ff=1, (32) ôt = Norm(log(Mel(pt))), (33)\nwhere pt ∈ RF is a real-valued vector of the power spectrum of the enhanced signal at a time step t, Mel(·) is the operation of DO × F Mel matrix multiplication, and Norm(·) is the operation of global mean and variance normalization so that its mean and variance become 0 and 1.\nEncoder(·), Attention(·), and Decoder(·) are defined in Eqs. (7), (8), and (9), respectively, with the sequence of the enhanced log Mel filterbank like features Ô as an input.\nThus, we can build a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition system, which converts multichannel speech signals to texts with a single network. Note that because all procedures, such as enhancement, feature extraction, encoder, attention, and decoder, are connected with differentiable graphs, we can optimize the overall inference to generate a correct label sequence.\nRelation to prior works\nThere have been several related studies of neural beamformers based on the filter estimation (Li et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016a) and the mask estimation (Heymann et al., 2016; Erdogan et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016b). The main difference is that such preceding studies use a component-level training objective within the conventional hybrid frameworks, while our work focuses on the entire end-to-end objective. For example, Heymann et al., 2016; Erdogan et al., 2016 use a signal-level objective (binary mask classification or regression) to train a network given parallel clean and noisy speech data. Li et al., 2016; Xiao et al., 2016a;b use ASR objectives (HMM state classification or sequence discriminative training), but they are still based on the hybrid approach. Speech recognition with raw multichannel waveforms (Hoshen et al., 2015; Sainath et al., 2016) can also be seen as using a neural beamformer, where the filter coefficients are represented as network parameters, but again these methods are still based on the hybrid approach.\nAs regards end-to-end speech recognition, all existing studies are based on a single channel setup. For example, most studies focus on a standard clean speech recognition setup without speech enhancement. (Chorowski et al., 2014; Graves & Jaitly, 2014; Chorowski et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2016; Miao et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2016).

Their endto-end networks were trained only with noisy speech data\nby following a conventional multi-condition training strategy (Vincent et al., 2016). During decoding, NOISY used single-channel noisy speech data from ’isolated 1ch track’ in CHiME-4 as an input, while BEAMFORMIT used the enhanced speech data obtained from 5-channel signals with BeamformIt (Anguera et al., 2007), which is well-known delay-and-sum beamformer, as an input.\nFILTER NET, MASK NET (REF), and MASK NET (ATT) were the multichannel end-to-end systems described in Section 4. To evaluate the validity of the reference selection, we prepared MASK NET (ATT) based on the maskbased beamformer with attention-based reference selection described in Section 3.2.3, and MASK NET (REF) with 5-th channel as a fixed reference microphone, which is located on the center front of the tablet device.\nTable 1 shows that BEAMFORMIT, FILTER NET, MASK NET (REF), and MASK NET (ATT) outperformed NOISY, which confirms the effectiveness of combining speech enhancement with the attention-based encoderdecoder framework.

FILTER NET, which is based on the filter estimation network described in Section 3.1, also improved the performance compared to NOISY, but worse than MASK NET (ATT). This is because it is difficult to optimize the filter estimation network due to a lack of restriction to estimate filter coefficients, and it needs some careful optimization, as suggested by (Xiao et al., 2016a). Finally, MASK NET (ATT) achieved better recognition performance than BEAMFORMIT, which proves the effectiveness of our joint integration rather than a pipe-line combination of speech enhancement and (end-to-end) speech recognition.\nTo further investigate the effectiveness of our proposed multichannel end-to-end framework, we also conducted the experiment on the AMI corpus. Table 2 compares the recognition performance of the three systems: NOISY, BEAMFORMIT, and MASK NET (ATT). In NOISY, we used noisy speech data from the 1st channel in AMI as an input to the system. Table 2 shows that, even in the AMI, our proposed MASK NET (ATT) achieved bet-\nter recognition performance than the attention-based baselines (NOISY and BEAMFORMIT), which also confirms the effectiveness of our proposed multichannel end-to-end framework. Note that BEAMFORMIT was worse than NOISY even with the enhanced signals. This phenomenon is sometimes observed in noisy speech recognition that the distortion caused by sole speech enhancement degrades the performance without re-training. Our end-to-end system jointly optimizes the speech enhancement part with the ASR objective, and can avoid such degradations."

      "text" : "As we discussed in Section 3.2, one unique characteristic of our proposed MASK NET (ATT) is the robustness/invariance against the number and order of channels without re-training. Table 3 shows an influence of the CHiME-4 validation accuracies on the number and order of channels. The validation accuracy was computed conditioned on the ground truth labels y∗1:n−1 in Eq. (10) during decoder’s recursive character generation, which has a strong correlation with CER. The second column of the table represents the channel indices, which were used as an input of the same MASK NET (ATT) network.\nComparison of 5 6 4 3 1 and 3 4 1 5 6 shows that the order of channels did not affect the recognition performance of MASK NET (ATT) at all, as we expected. In addition, even when we used fewer three or four channels as an input, MASK NET (ATT) still outperformed NOISY (single channel). These results confirm that our proposed multichannel end-to-end system can deal with input signals with arbitrary number and order of channels, without any reconfiguration and re-training."

We could confirm that the BeamformIt and MASK NET (ATT) successfully suppressed the noises comparing to the 5-th channel signal by eliminat-\ning blurred red areas overall. In addition, by focusing on the insides of black boxes, the harmonic structure, which was corrupted in the 5-th channel signal, was recovered in BeamformIt and MASK NET (ATT).\nThis result suggests that our proposed MASK NET (ATT) successfully learned a noise suppression function similar to the conventional beamformer, although it is optimized based on the end-to-end ASR objective, without explicitly using clean data as a target."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, we extended an existing attention-based encoder-decoder framework by integrating a neural beamformer and proposed a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition framework. It can jointly optimize the overall inference in multichannel speech recognition (i.e., from speech enhancement to speech recognition) based on the end-to-end ASR objective, and it can generalize to dif-\nferent numbers and configurations of microphones. The experimental results on challenging noisy speech recognition benchmarks, CHiME-4 and AMI, show that the proposed framework outperformed the end-to-end baseline with noisy and delay-and-sum beamformed inputs.\nThe current system still has data sparseness issues due to the lack of lexicon and language models, unlike the conventional hybrid approach. Therefore, the results reported in the paper did not reach the state-of-the-art performance in these benchmarks, but they are still convincing to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Our most important future work is to overcome these data sparseness issues by developing adaptation techniques of an end-to-end framework with the incorporation of linguistic resources."

Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer.",
