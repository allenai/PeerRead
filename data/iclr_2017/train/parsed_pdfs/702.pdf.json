      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Document summarization is an important problem that has many applications in information retrieval and natural language understanding. Summarization techniques are mainly classified into two categories: extractive and abstractive. Extractive methods aim to select salient snippets, sentences or passages from documents, while abstractive summarization techniques aim to concisely paraphrase the information content in the documents.\nA vast majority of the literature on document summarization is devoted to extractive summarization. Traditional methods for extractive summarization can be broadly classified into greedy approaches (e.g., Carbonell & Goldstein (1998)), graph based approaches (e.g., Radev & Erkan (2004)) and constraint optimization based approaches (e.g., McDonald (2007)).\nRecently, neural network based approaches have become popular for extractive summarization. For example, Kageback et al. (2014) employed the recursive autoencoder (Socher et al. (2011)) to summarize documents, producing best performance on the Opinosis dataset (Ganesan et al. (2010)). Yin & Pei (2015) applied Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to project sentences to continuous vector space and then select sentences by minimizing the cost based on their ‘prestige’ and ‘diverseness’, on the task of multi-document extractive summarization. Another related work is that of Cao et al. (2016), who address the problem of query-focused multi-document summarization using query-attention-weighted CNNs.\nRecently, with the emergence of strong generative neural models for text Bahdanau et al. (2014), abstractive techniques are also becoming increasingly popular (Rush et al. (2015), Nallapati et al. (2016b) and Nallapati et al. (2016a)). Despite the emergence of abstractive techniques, extractive techniques are still attractive as they are less complex, less expensive, and generate grammatically\nand semantically correct summaries most of the time. In a very recent work, Cheng & Lapata (2016) proposed an attentional encoder-decoder for extractive single-document summarization and trained it on Daily Mail corpus, a large news data set, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Like Cheng & Lapata (2016), our work also focuses only on sentential extractive summarization of single documents using neural networks."

      "heading" : "2 TWO ARCHITECTURES",
      "text" : "Our architectures are motivated by two intuitive strategies that humans tend to adopt when they are tasked with extracting salient sentences in a document. The first strategy, which we call Classify, involves reading the whole document once to understand its contents, and then traversing through the sentences in the original document order and deciding whether or not each sentence belongs to the summary. The other strategy that we call Select involves memorizing the whole document once as before, and then picking sentences that should belong to the summary one at a time, in any order of one’s choosing. Qualitatively, the latter strategy appears to be a better one since it allows us to make globally optimal decisions at each step. While it may be harder for humans to follow this strategy since we are forgetful by nature, one may expect that the Select strategy could deliver an advantage for the machines, since ’forgetfulness’ is not a real ‘concern’ for them. In this work, we will explore both the strategies empirically and make a recommendation on which strategy is optimal under what conditions.\nBroadly, our Classify architecture involves an RNN based sequence classification model that sequentially classifies each sentence into 0/1 binary labels, while the Select architecture involves a generative model that sequentially generates the indices of the sentences that should belong to the summary. We will first discuss the components shared by both the architectures and then we will present each architecture separately.\nShared Building Blocks: Both architectures begin with word-level bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based RNNs (Chung et al. (2014)) run independently over each sentence in the document, where each time-step of the RNN corresponds to a word index in the sentence. The average pooling of the concatenated hidden states of this bidirectional RNN is then used as an input to another bidirectional RNN whose time steps correspond to sentence indices in the document. The concatenated hidden states ‘h’ from the forward and backward layers of this second layer of bidirectional RNN at each time step are used as corresponding sentence representations. We also use the average pooling of the sentence representations as the document representation ‘d’. Both architectures also maintain a dynamic summary representation ‘s’ whose estimation is architecture dependent. Models under each architecture compute a score for each sentence towards its summary membership. Motivated by the need to build humanly interpretable models, we compute this score by explicitly modeling abstract features such as salience, novelty and information content as shown below:\nscore(hj , sj ,d,pj) = wcσ(W T c hj) #(content richness)\n+wsσ(cos(hj ,d)) #(salience w.r.t. document)\n+wpσ(W T p pj) #(positional importance)\n−wrσ(cos(hj , sj)) #(redundancy w.r.t. summary) +b), #(bias term) (1)\nwhere j is the index of the sentence in the document, pj is the positional embedding of the sentence computed by concatenation of embeddings corresponding to forward and backward position indices of the sentence in the document; cos(a,b) is the standard cosine similarity between the two vectors a and b; Wc and Wp are parameter vectors to model content richness and positional importance of sentences respectively; and wc, ws, wp and wr are scalar weights to model relative importance of various abstract features, and are learned automatically. In the equation above, the abstract feature that each term represents is printed against the term in comments. In other words, assuming the importance weights are positive, in order for a sentence to score high for summary membership, it needs to be highly salient, content rich and occupy important positions in the document, while being least redundant with respect to the summary generated till that point. Note that our formulation of the scoring function simultaneously captures both salience of the sentence hj with respect to the document d as well as its redundancy with respect to the current summary representation sj . In\nthe next subsection, we will describe the estimation of dynamic summary representation sj and the formulation of the cost function for training in each architecture. We will also present shallow and deep models under each architecture."

      "heading" : "2.1 CLASSIFIER ARCHITECTURE",
      "text" : "In this architecture, we sequentially visit each sentence in the original document order and binaryclassify the sentence in terms of whether it belongs to the summary. The probability of the sentence belonging to the summary, P (yj = 1) is given as follows:\nP (yj = 1|hj , sj ,d,pj) = σ(score(hj , sj ,d,pj) (2) The objective function to minimize at training is the negative log-likelihood of the training data labels:\n`(W,w,b) = − N∑\nd=1 Nd∑ j=1 (ydj logP (y d j = 1|hdj , sdj ,dd) + (1− ydj ) log(1− P (ydj = 1|hdj , sdj ,dd))\nwhere N is the size of the training corpus and Nd is the number of sentences in the document d. Now the only detail that remains is how the dynamic summary representation sj is estimated. This is where the shallow and deep models under this architecture differ, and we describe them below.\nShallow Model: In the shallow model, we estimate the dynamic summary representation as the running sum of the representations of the sentences visited so far weighted by their probability of being in the summary.\nsj = j−1∑ i=1 hiyi #(training time)\nsj = j−1∑ i=1 hiP (yi = 1|hi, si,d) #(test time)\n(3)\nIn other words, at training time, since the summary membership of sentences is known, the probabilities are binary, whereas at test time we use a weighted pooling based on the estimated probability\nthat each sentence belongs to the summary. There is no need to normalize the summary representations since the cosine similarity metric we use in the scoring function of Eq. (1) automatically normalizes them.\nDeep Model: In the deep model, we introduce an additional layer of unidirectional sentence-level GRU-RNN that takes as input the sentence representations hj at each time-step. The hidden state of the new GRU ĥj = GRU(hj) is used as a replacement for sentence representation hj in computing summary membership scores using Eq. (1) as well as in computing the dynamic summary representation using Eq. (3). The main idea behind using this additional layer of GRU is to allow a greater degree of non-linearity in computing the summary representation.\nThe graphical representations of the shallow and deep models under the Classifier architecture are displayed in Figure 1 with their full set of dependencies."

      "heading" : "2.2 SELECTOR ARCHITECTURE",
      "text" : "In this architecture, the models do not make decisions in the sequence of sentence ordering; instead, they pick one sentence at a time in an order that they deem fit. The act of picking a sentence is cast as a sequential generative model in which one sentence-index is emitted at each time step that maximizes the score in Eq. 1. Accordingly, the probability of picking a sentence with index I(j) = k ∈ {1, . . . , Nd} at time-step j is given by the softmax over the scoring function:\nP (I(j) = k|sj ,hk,d) = exp(score(hk, sj ,d,pk))∑\nl∈{1,...,Nd} exp(score(hl, sj ,d,pl)) (4)\nThe loss function in this case is the negative log-likelihood of the selected sentences in the ground truth data as shown below.\n`(W,w,b) = − N∑\nd=1 Md∑ j=1 logP (I(j)(d)|hI(j)(d) , sdj ,dd) (5)\nwhere Md is the number of sentences selected in the ground truth of document d, {I(1)(d), . . . , I(Md)(d)} is the ordered list of selected sentence indices in the ground truth of document d. The dependence of the loss function on the order of the selected sentences can be gauged by the fact that the probability of selecting a sentence at time step j depends on the dynamic summary representation sj , which is estimated based on the all sentences selected up to time step j − 1. At test time, at each time-step, the model emits the index of the sentence that has the best score given the current summary representation as shown below.\nI(j) = arg max k∈{1,...,Nd} score(hk, sj ,d,pk) (6)\nThe estimation of dynamic summary representation is done differently for the shallow and deep selector models as described below.\nShallow Model: In this model, we sum the representations of the selected sentences until the time step j as the dynamic summary representation. This is true for both training time and test time.\nsj = j−1∑ i=1 hI(i). (7)\nDeep Model: In the deep model, we introduce an additional GRU-RNN whose time steps correspond to the sentence index emission events. At each time-step, it takes as input the representation of the previously selected sentence hI(j−1), and computes a new hidden state ĥj = GRU(hI(j−1)). Unlike the shallow model that maintains a separate vector for summary representation sj , we use ĥj as the summary representation sj at time step j. This makes sense for the case of the Selector architecture since both at training and test time we make hard decisions of sentence selection, with the effect that the hidden state of the new GRU can capture a non-linear aggregation of the sentences selected until time step j − 1.\nFig. 2 shows the graphical representation of the Selector architecture with all the dependencies between the nodes. The architecture is the same for both shallow and deep models with the only difference being that the simple summary representation in the former is replaced with a gated recurrent unit in the latter."

      "heading" : "3 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Previous researcher such as Shen et al. (2007) have proposed modeling extractive document summarization as a sequence classification problem using Conditional Random Fields. Our approach is different from theirs in the sense that we use RNNs in our model that do not require any handcrafted features for representing sentences and documents.\nThe Selector architecture broadly involves ranking of sentences by some criterion, therefore does correspond to traditional methods for extractive summarization such as TextRank (Mihalcea & Tarau (2004)) that also involve ranking of sentences by salience and novelty. However, to the best of our knowledge, our Selector framework is a novel deep learning framework for extractive summarization. Broader efforts are being made in the deep learning community to build more sophisticated sequence to sequence models towards the objective of automatically learning complex tasks such as sorting sequences (Oriol Vinyals (2015); Graves et al. (2014)), but their utility for extractive summarization remains to be explored.\nIn the deep learning framework, the extractive summarization work of Cheng & Lapata (2016) is the closest to our work. Their model is based on an encoder-decoder approach where the encoder learns the representation of sentences and documents while the decoder classifies each sentence using an attention mechanism. Broadly, their model is also in the Classifier framework, but architecturally, our approaches are different. While their approach can be termed as a multi-pass approach where both the encoder and decoder consume the same sentence representations, our approach is a deep one where the representations learned by the bidirectional GRU encoder are in turn consumed by the Classifier or Selector models. Another key difference between our work and theirs is that unlike our unsupervised greedy approach to convert abstractive summaries to extractive labels, Cheng & Lapata (2016) chose to train a separate supervised classifier using manually created labels on a subset of the data. This may yield more accurate gold extractive labels which may help boost the performance of their models, but incurs additional annotation costs."

      "heading" : "4 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS",
      "text" : "Pseudo ground-truth generation: In order to train our extractive Classifier and Selector models, for each document we need ground truth in the form of sentence-level binary labels and ordered list of selected sentences respectively. However, most summarization corpora only contain human written abstractive summaries as ground truth. To solve this problem, we use an unsupervised approach to convert the abstractive summaries to extractive labels. Our approach is based on the idea that the selected sentences from the document should be the ones that maximize the Rouge score with respect to gold abstractive summaries. Since it is computationally expensive to find a globally optimal subset of sentences that maximizes the Rouge score, we employ a greedy approach, where we add one sentence at a time incrementally to the summary, such that the Rouge score of the current set of selected sentences is maximized with respect to the entire gold summary. We stop adding sentences when either none of the remaining candidate sentences improves the Rouge score upon addition to the current summary set or when the maximum summary length is reached. We return this ordered list of sentences as the ground-truth for the Selector architecture. The ordered list is converted into binary summary-membership labels that are consumed by the Classifier architecture for training.\nWe note that similar approaches have been employed by other researchers such as Svore et al. (2007) to handle the problem of converting abstractive summaries to extractive ground truth. We would also like to point readers to a recent work by Cao et al. (2015) that proposes an ILP based approach to solve this problem optimally. Since this is not the focus of this work, we chose a simple greedy algorithm.\nCorpora: For our experiments, we used the Daily Mail corpus originally constructed by Hermann et al. (2015) for the task of passage-based question answering, and re-purposed for the task of document summarization as proposed in Cheng & Lapata (2016) for extractive summarization and Nallapati et al. (2016a) for abstractive summarization. Overall, we have 196,557 training documents, 12,147 validation documents and 10,396 test documents from the Daily Mail corpus. On average, there are about 28 sentences per document in the training set, and an average of 3-4 sentences in the reference summaries. The average word count per document in the training set is 802.\nWe also used the DUC 2002 single-document summarization dataset1 consisting of 567 documents as an additional out-of-domain test set to evaluate our models.\nEvaluation: In our experiments below, we evaluate the performance of our models using different variants of the Rouge metric2 computed with respect to the gold abstractive summaries. Following Cheng & Lapata (2016), we use limited length Rouge recall at 75 bytes of summary as well as 275 bytes on the Daily Mail corpus. On DUC 2002 corpus, following the official guidelines, we use limited length Rouge recall at 75 words. We report the scores from Rouge-1, Rouge-2 and RougeL, which are computed using matches of unigrams, bigrams and longest common subsequences respectively, with the ground truth summaries.\nBaselines: On all datasets, we use Lead-3 model, which simply produces the leading three sentences of the document as the summary, as a baseline. On the Daily Mail and DUC 2002 corpora, we also report performance of LReg, a feature-rich logistic classifier used as a baseline by Cheng & Lapata (2016). On DUC 2002 corpus, we report several baselines such as Integer Linear Programming based approach (Woodsend & Lapata (2010)), and graph based approaches such as TGRAPH (Parveen et al. (2015)) and URANK (Wan (2010)) which achieve very high performance on this corpus. In addition, we also compare with the state-of-the art deep learning supervised extractive model from Cheng & Lapata (2016).\nExperimental Settings: We used 100-dimensional word2vec (Mikolov et al. (2013)) embeddings trained on the Daily Mail corpus as our embedding initialization. We limited the vocabulary size to 150K and the maximum sentence length to 50 words, to speed up computation. We fixed the model hidden state size at 200. We used a batch size of 32 at training time, and employed adadelta (Zeiler (2012)) to train our model. We employed gradient clipping and L-2 regularization to prevent overfitting and an early stopping criterion based on validation cost.\n1http://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/2002.html 2http://www.berouge.com/Pages/default.aspx\nAt test time, for the Classifier models we pick sentences sorted by the predicted probabilities until we exceed the length limit as determined by the Rouge metric. Likewise, we allow the Selector models to emit sentence indices until the desired summary length is reached. For the Selector model, we also make sure the emitted sentence ids are not repeated across time steps by traversing down the sorted predicted probabilities of the softmax layer at each time step until we reach a sentence-id that was not emitted before.\nWe note that it is possible to optimize the Classifier performance at test time using the Viterbi algorithm to compute the best sequence of labels, subject to the Markovian assumptions of the architecture and model. Similarly, it is also possible to further boost the Selector’s performance by using beam search at test time. However, in this work we used greedy classification/selection for inference since our primary interest is in comparing the two architectures, and our choice allows us to make a fair apples-to-apples comparison.\nResults on Daily Mail corpus: Table 1 shows the performance comparison of our models with state-of-the-art model of Cheng & Lapata (2016) and other baselines on the DailyMail corpus using Rouge recall at two different summary lengths.\nThe results show that contrary to our initial expectation, the Classifier architecture is superior to the Selector architecture. Within each architecture, the deeper models are better performing than the shallower ones. Our deep classifier model outperforms Cheng & Lapata (2016) with a statistically significant margin at 75 bytes, while matching their model at 275 bytes. One potential reason our models do not consistently outperform the extractive model of Cheng & Lapata (2016) is the additional supervised training they used to create sentence-level extractive labels to train their model. Our models instead use an unsupervised greedy approximation to create extractive labels from abstractive summaries, and as a result, may generate noisier ground truth than theirs.\nResults on the Out-of-Domain DUC 2002 corpus: We also evaluated the models trained on the DailyMail corpus on the out-of-domain DUC 2002 set as shown in Table 2. The performance trend is similar to that on Daily Mail. Our best model, Deep Classifier is again statistically on par with the model of Cheng & Lapata (2016). However, both models perform worse than graph-based TGRAPH (Parveen et al. (2015)) and URANK (Wan (2010)) algorithms, which are the state-of-the-art models on this corpus. Deep learning based supervised models such as ours and that of Cheng & Lapata (2016) perform very well on the domain they are trained on, but may suffer from domain adaptation issues when tested on a different corpus such as DUC 2002."

      "heading" : "5 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Impact of Document Structure: In all our experiments thus far, the classifier architecture has proven superior to the selector architecture. We conjecture that decision making in the same sequence as the original sentence ordering is perhaps advantageous in document summarization since there is a smooth sequential discourse structure in news stories starting with the main highlights of the story in the beginning, more elaborate description in the middle and ending with conclusive remarks. If this is true, then in scenarios where sentence ordering is less structured, the selector\narchitecture should be superior since it has freedom to select salient sentences in any arbitrary order. Such scenarios actually do occur in practice, e.g., summarization of a cluster of tweets on a topic where there is no specific discourse structure between individual tweets, or in multi-document summarization where a pair of sentences across document boundaries have no specific ordering. In order to test this hypothesis, we simulated such data in the Daily Mail corpus by randomly shuffling the sentences in each document in the training set and retraining models under both the architectures, and evaluating them on the original test sets. The results, summarized in Table 3, show that the Classifier architecture suffers bigger losses than the Selector architecture when the document structure is destroyed. In fact, the Selector architecture performs slightly better than the Classifier architecture when trained on the shuffled data, indicating that our hypothesis may indeed be true.\nQualitative Analysis: One of the advantages of our model design is teasing out various abstract features for the sake of interpretability of system predictions. In the appendix, we present a visualization (see Fig. 3 in the Appendix) of the system predictions based on the scores for various abstract features listed in Eq. (1). We also present the learned importance weights of these features in Table 4. A few representative documents are also presented in the appendix highlighting the sentences chosen by our models for summarization."

Our proposed models under these architectures are not only very interpretable, but also achieve state-of-the-art performance on two different data sets. We also empirically compare our two frameworks and suggest conditions under which each of them can deliver optimal performance.\nAs part of our future work, we plan to further investigate the applicability of the novel Selector architecture to relatively less structured summarization problems such as summarization of multiple documents or topical clusters of tweets. In addition, we also intend to perform additional experiments on the Daily Mail dataset such as incorporating beam search in both model inference as well in pseudo ground truth generation that may result in further performance improvements."

Note that the priority of features in the ablation experiments need not correspond to their priority in terms of learned weights in Table 4, since feature correlations may affect the two metrics differently. For the deep classifier, content and redundancy seem to matter the most while for the deep selector, dropping positional features hurts the most. Based on this analysis, we plan to investigate more thoroughly the reasons behind the poor ablation performance of salience and redundancy in the classifier and selector models respectively."

Their model is based on an encoder-decoder approach where the encoder learns the representation of sentences and documents while the decoder classifies each sentence using an attention mechanism. Broadly, their model is also in the Classifier framework, but architecturally, our approaches are different. While their approach can be termed as a multi-pass approach where both the encoder and decoder consume the same sentence representations, our approach is a deep one where the representations learned by the bidirectional GRU encoder are in turn consumed by the Classifier or Selector models. Another key difference between our work and theirs is that unlike our unsupervised greedy approach to convert abstractive summaries to extractive labels, Cheng & Lapata (2016) chose to train a separate supervised classifier using manually created labels on a subset of the data.",

(2015) for the task of passage-based question answering, and re-purposed for the task of document summarization as proposed in Cheng & Lapata (2016) for extractive summarization and Nallapati et al. (2016a) for abstractive summarization. Overall, we have 196,557 training documents, 12,147 validation documents and 10,396 test documents from the Daily Mail corpus. On average, there are about 28 sentences per document in the training set, and an average of 3-4 sentences in the reference summaries. The average word count per document in the training set is 802. We also used the DUC 2002 single-document summarization dataset1 consisting of 567 documents as an additional out-of-domain test set to evaluate our models. Evaluation: In our experiments below, we evaluate the performance of our models using different variants of the Rouge metric2 computed with respect to the gold abstractive summaries. Following Cheng & Lapata (2016), we use limited length Rouge recall at 75 bytes of summary as well as 275 bytes on the Daily Mail corpus. On DUC 2002 corpus, following the official guidelines, we use limited length Rouge recall at 75 words. We report the scores from Rouge-1, Rouge-2 and RougeL, which are computed using matches of unigrams, bigrams and longest common subsequences respectively, with the ground truth summaries. Baselines: On all datasets, we use Lead-3 model, which simply produces the leading three sentences of the document as the summary, as a baseline. On the Daily Mail and DUC 2002 corpora, we also report performance of LReg, a feature-rich logistic classifier used as a baseline by Cheng & Lapata (2016). On DUC 2002 corpus, we report several baselines such as Integer Linear Programming based approach (Woodsend & Lapata (2010)), and graph based approaches such as TGRAPH (Parveen et al.

The Classifier based architecture sequentially accepts or rejects each sentence in the original document order for its membership in the final summary. The Selector architecture, on the other hand, is free to pick one sentence at a time in any arbitrary order to piece together the summary. Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences. In addition, these models have the advantage of being very interpretable, since they allow visualization of their predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and redundancy. We show that our models reach or outperform state-of-the-art supervised models on two different corpora. We also recommend the conditions under which one architecture is superior to the other based on experimental evidence.",
