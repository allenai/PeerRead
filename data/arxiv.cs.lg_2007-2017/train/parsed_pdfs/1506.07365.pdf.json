      "text" : "Control of non-linear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces is one of the key problems in robotics and, in a broader context, in reinforcement learning for autonomous agents. A prominent class of algorithms that aim to solve this problem are model-based locally optimal (stochastic) control algorithms such as iLQG control [1, 2], which approximate the general nonlinear control problem via local linearization. When combined with receding horizon control [3], and machine learning methods for learning approximate system models, such algorithms are powerful tools for solving complicated control problems [3, 4, 5]; however, they either rely on a known system model or require the design of relatively low-dimensional state representations. For real autonomous agents to succeed, we ultimately need algorithms that are capable of controlling complex dynamical systems from raw sensory input (e.g. images) only. In this paper we tackle this difficult problem.\nIf stochastic optimal control (SOC) methods were applied directly to control from raw image data, they would face two major obstacles. First, sensory data is usually high-dimensional – i.e. images with thousands of pixels – rendering a naive SOC solution computationally infeasible. Second, the image content is typically a highly non-linear function of the system dynamics underlying the observations; thus model identification and control of this dynamics are non-trivial.\nWhile both problems could, in principle, be addressed by designing more advanced SOC algorithms we approach the “optimal control from raw images” problem differently: turning the problem of locally optimal control in high-dimensional non-linear systems into one of identifying a low-dimensional latent state space, in which locally optimal control can be performed robustly and easily. To learn such a latent space we propose a new deep generative model belonging to the class of variational autoencoders [6, 7] that is derived from an iLQG formulation in latent space. The resulting Embed to Control (E2C) system is a probabilistic generative model that holds a belief over viable trajectories in sensory space, allows for accurate long-term planning in latent space, and is trained fully unsupervised. We demonstrate the success of our approach on four challenging tasks for control from raw images and compare it to a range of methods for unsupervised representation learning. As an aside, we also validate that deep up-convolutional networks [8, 9] are powerful generative models for large images. ∗Authors contributed equally.\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n07 36\n5v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 N\nov 2"

The function f(st,ut) is an arbitrary, smooth, system dynamics. We equivalently refer to Equation (1) using the notation P (st+1|st,ut), which we assume to be a multivariate normal distributionN (f(st,ut),Σξ). We further assume that we are only given access to visual depictions xt ∈ Rnx of state st. This restriction requires solving a joint state identification and control problem. For simplicity we will in the following assume that xt is a fully observed depiction of st, but relax this assumption later.\nOur goal then is to infer a low-dimensional latent state space model in which optimal control can be performed. That is, we seek to learn a function m, mapping from high-dimensional images xt to low-dimensional vectors zt ∈ Rnz with nz nx, such that the control problem can be solved using zt instead of xt: zt = m(xt) + ω, ω ∼ N (0,Σω), (2) whereω accounts for system noise; or equivalently zt ∼ N (m(xt),Σω). Assuming for the moment that such a function can be learned (or approximated), we will first define SOC in a latent space and introduce our model thereafter."

      "text" : "Let zt ∈ Rnz be the inferred latent state from image xt of state st and f lat(zt,ut) the transition dynamics in latent space, i.e., zt+1 = f lat(zt,ut). Thus f lat models the changes that occur in zt when control ut is applied to the underlying system as a latent space analogue to f(st,ut). Assuming f lat is known, optimal controls for a trajectory of length T in the dynamical system can be derived by minimizing the function J(z1:T ,u1:T ) which gives the expected future costs when following (z1:T ,u1:T ):\nJ(z1:T ,u1:T ) = Ez [ cT (zT ,uT ) +\nT−1∑ t0 c(zt,ut)\n] , (3)\nwhere c(zt,ut) are instantaneous costs, cT (zT ,uT ) denotes terminal costs and z1:T = {z1, . . . , zT } and u1:T = {u1, . . . ,uT } are state and action sequences respectively. If zt contains sufficient information about st, i.e., st can be inferred from zt alone, and f lat is differentiable, the cost-minimizing controls can be computed from J(z1:T ,u1:T ) via SOC algorithms [10]. These optimal control algorithms approximate the global non-linear dynamics with locally linear dynamics at each time step t. Locally optimal actions can then be found in closed form. Formally, given a reference trajectory z̄1:T – the current estimate for the optimal trajectory – together with corresponding controls ū1:T the system is linearized as\nzt+1 = A(z̄t)zt + B(z̄t)ut + o(z̄t) + ω, ω ∼ N (0,Σω), (4) where A(z̄t) = δf lat(z̄t,ūt) δz̄t , B(z̄t) = δf lat(z̄t,ūt) δūt are local Jacobians, and o(z̄t) is an offset. To enable efficient computation of the local controls we assume the costs to be a quadratic function of the latent representation\nc(zt,ut) = (zt − zgoal)TRz(zt − zgoal) + uTt Ruut, (5) where Rz ∈ Rnz×nz and Ru ∈ Rnu×nu are cost weighting matrices and zgoal is the inferred representation of the goal state. We also assume cT (zT ,uT ) = c(zT ,uT ) throughout this paper. In combination with Equation (4) this gives us a local linear-quadratic-Gaussian formulation at each time step t which can be solved by SOC algorithms such as iterative linear-quadratic regulation (iLQR) [11] or approximate inference control (AICO) [12]. The result of this trajectory optimization step is a locally optimal trajectory with corresponding control sequence (z∗1:T ,u ∗ 1:T ) ≈ arg minz1:T u1:T J(z1:T ,u1:T )."

      "heading" : "2.3 A locally linear latent state space model for dynamical systems",
      "text" : "Starting from the SOC formulation, we now turn to the problem of learning an appropriate lowdimensional latent representation zt ∼ P (Zt|m(xt),Σω) of xt. The representation zt has to fulfill three properties: (i) it must capture sufficient information about xt (enough to enable reconstruction); (ii) it must allow for accurate prediction of the next latent state zt+1 and thus, implicitly, of the next observation xt+1; (iii) the prediction f lat of the next latent state must be locally linearizable for all valid control magnitudes ut. Given some representation zt, properties (ii) and (iii) in particular require us to capture possibly highly non-linear changes of the latent representation due to transformations of the observed scene induced by control commands. Crucially, these are particularly hard to model and subsequently linearize. We circumvent this problem by taking a more direct approach: instead of learning a latent space z and transition model f lat which are then linearized and combined with SOC algorithms, we directly impose desired transformation properties on the representation zt during learning. We will select these properties such that prediction in the latent space as well as locally linear inference of the next observation according to Equation (4) are easy.\nThe transformation properties that we desire from a latent representation can be formalized directly from the iLQG formulation given in Section 2.2 . Formally, following Equation (2), let the latent representation be Gaussian P (Z|X) = N (m(xt),Σω). To infer zt from xt we first require a method for sampling latent states. Ideally, we would generate samples directly from the unknown true posterior P (Z|X), which we, however, have no access to. Following the variational Bayes approach (see Jordan et al. [13] for an overview) we resort to sampling zt from an approximate posterior distribution Qφ(Z|X) with parameters φ. Inference model for Qφ. In our work this is always a diagonal Gaussian distribution Qφ(Z|X) = N (µt, diag(σ2t )), whose mean µt ∈ Rnz and covariance Σt = diag(σ2t ) ∈ Rnz×nz are computed by an encoding neural network with outputs\nµt = Wµh enc φ (xt) + bµ, (6) logσt = Wσh enc φ (xt) + bσ, (7)\nwhere hencφ ∈ Rne is the activation of the last hidden layer and where φ is given by the set of all learnable parameters of the encoding network, including the weight matrices Wµ, Wσ and biases bµ, bσ . Parameterizing the mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution based on a neural network gives us a natural and very expressive model for our latent space. It additionally comes with the benefit that we can use the reparameterization trick [6, 7] to backpropagate gradients of a loss function based on samples through the latent distribution.\nGenerative model for Pθ. Using the approximate posterior distribution Qφ we generate observed samples (images) x̃t and x̃t+1 from latent samples zt and zt+1 by enforcing a locally linear relationship in latent space according to Equation (4), yielding the following generative model\nzt ∼ Qφ(Z | X) = N (µt,Σt), ẑt+1 ∼ Q̂ψ(Ẑ | Z,u) = N (Atµt + Btut + ot,Ct),\nx̃t, x̃t+1 ∼ Pθ(X | Z) = Bernoulli(pt), (8)\nwhere Q̂ψ is the next latent state posterior distribution, which exactly follows the linear form required for stochastic optimal control. With ωt ∼ N (0,Ht) as an estimate of the system noise,\nC can be decomposed as Ct = AtΣtATt + Ht. Note that while the transition dynamics in our generative model operates on the inferred latent space, it takes untransformed controls into account. That is, we aim to learn a latent space such that the transition dynamics in z linearizes the non-linear observed dynamics in x and is locally linear in the applied controls u. Reconstruction of an image from zt is performed by passing the sample through multiple hidden layers of a decoding neural network which computes the mean pt of the generative Bernoulli distribution1 Pθ(X|Z) as\npt = Wph dec θ (zt) + bp, (9)\nwhere hdecθ (zt) ∈ Rnd is the response of the last hidden layer in the decoding network. The set of parameters for the decoding network, including weight matrix Wp and bias bp, then make up the learned generative parameters θ.\nTransition model for Q̂ψ . What remains is to specify how the linearization matrices At ∈ Rnz×nz , Bt ∈ Rnz×nu and offset ot ∈ Rnz are predicted. Following the same approach as for distribution means and covariance matrices, we predict all local transformation parameters from samples zt based on the hidden representation htransψ (zt) ∈ Rnt of a third neural network with parameters ψ – to which we refer as the transformation network. Specifically, we parametrize the transformation matrices and offset as\nvec[At] = WA htransψ (zt) + bA, vec[Bt] = WB htransψ (zt) + bB ,\not = Wo h trans ψ (zt) + bo,\n(10)\nwhere vec denotes vectorization and therefore vec[At] ∈ R(n 2 z) and vec[Bt] ∈ R(nz·nu). To circumvent estimating the full matrix At of size nz × nz , we can choose it to be a perturbation of the identity matrix At = (I + vtrTt ) which reduces the parameters to be estimated for At to 2nz .\nA sketch of the complete architecture is shown in Figure 1. It also visualizes an additional constraint that is essential for learning a representation for long-term predictions: we require samples ẑt+1 from the state transition distribution Q̂ψ to be similar to the encoding of xt+1 through Qφ. While it might seem that just learning a perfect reconstruction of xt+1 from ẑt+1 is enough, we require multistep predictions for planning in Z which must correspond to valid trajectories in the observed space X . Without enforcing similarity between samples from Q̂ψ and Qφ, following a transition in latent space from zt with action ut may lead to a point ẑt+1, from which reconstruction of xt+1 is possible, but that is not a valid encoding (i.e. the model will never encode any image as ẑt+1). Executing another action in ẑt+1 then does not result in a valid latent state – since the transition model is conditional on samples coming from the inference network – and thus long-term predictions fail. In a nutshell, such a divergence between encodings and the transition model results in a generative model that does not accurately model the Markov chain formed by the observations."

The second KL divergence in Equation (11) is an additional contraction term with weight λ, that enforces agreement between the transition and inference models. This term is essential for establishing a Markov chain in latent space that corresponds to the real system dynamics (see Section 2.3 above for an in depth discussion). This KL divergence can also be seen as a prior on the latent transition model. Note that all KL terms can be computed analytically for our model (see supplementary for details).\nDuring training we approximate the expectation in L(D) via sampling. Specifically, we take one sample zt for each input xt and transform that sample using Equation (10) to give a valid sample ẑt+1 from Q̂ψ . We then jointly learn all parameters of our model by minimizing L(D) using SGD."

We consider two different network types for our model: Standard fully connected neural networks with up to three layers, which work well for moderately sized images, are used for the planar and swing-up experiments; A deep convolutional network for the encoder in combination with an up-convolutional network as the decoder which, in accordance with recent findings from the literature [8, 9], we found to be an adequate model for larger images. Training was performed using Adam [14] throughout all experiments. The training data set D for all tasks was generated by randomly sampling N state observations and actions with corresponding successor states. For the plane we used N=3, 000 samples, for the inverted pendulum and cart-pole system we used N= 15, 000 and for the arm N=30, 000. A complete list of architecture parameters and hyperparameter choices as well as an in-depth explanation of the up-convolutional network are specified in the supplementary material. We will make our code and a video containing controlled trajectories for all systems available under http://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/research/e2c .\nModel variants. In addition to the Embed to Control (E2C) dynamics model derived above, we also consider two variants: By removing the latent dynamics network htransψ , i.e. setting its output to one in Equation (10) – we obtain a variant in which At, Bt and ot are estimated as globally linear matrices (Global E2C). If we instead replace the transition model with a network estimating the dynamics as a non-linear function f̂ lat and only linearize during planning, estimating At, Bt, ot as Jacobians to f̂ lat as described in Section 2.2, we obtain a variant with nonlinear latent dynamics.\nBaseline models. For a thorough comparison and to exhibit the complicated nature of the tasks, we also test a set of baseline models on the plane and the inverted pendulum task (using the same architecture as the E2C model): a standard variational autoencoder (VAE) and a deep autoencoder (AE) are trained on the autoencoding subtask for visual problems. That is, given a data set D used for training our model, we remove all actions from the tuples in D and disregard temporal context between images. After autoencoder training we learn a dynamics model in latent space, approximating f lat from Section 2.2. We also consider a VAE variant with a slowness term on the latent representation – a full description of this variant is given in the supplementary material.\nOptimal control algorithms. To perform optimal control in the latent space of different models, we employ two trajectory optimization algorithms: iterative linear quadratic regulation (iLQR) [11] (for the plane and inverted pendulum) and approximate inference control (AICO) [12] (all other experiments). For all VAEs both methods operate on the mean of distributions Qφ and Q̂ψ . AICO additionally makes use of the local Gaussian covariances Σt and Ct. Except for the experiments on the planar system, control was performed in a model predictive control fashion using the receding horizon scheme introduced in [3]. To obtain closed loop control given an image xt, it is first passed through the encoder to obtain the latent state zt. A locally optimal trajectory is subsequently found by optimizing (z∗t:t+T ,u\n∗ t:t+T ) ≈ arg minzt:t+Tut:t+T J(zt:t+T ,ut:t+T ) with fixed, small horizon\nT (with T = 10 unless noted otherwise). Controls u∗t are applied to the system and a transition to zt+1 is observed (by encoding the next image xt+1). Then a new control sequence – with horizon\nT – starting in zt+1 is found using the last estimated trajectory as a bootstrap. Note that planning is performed entirely in the latent state without access to any observations except for the depiction of the current state. To compute the cost function c(zt,ut) required for trajectory optimization in z we assume knowledge of the observation xgoal of the goal state sgoal. This observation is then transformed into latent space and costs are computed according to Equation (5)."

The high-dimensional representation of a state is a 40 × 40 black-and-white image. Obstructed by six circular obstacles, the task is to move to the bottom right of the image, starting from a random x position at the top of the image. The encodings of obstacles are obtained prior to planning and an additional quadratic cost term is penalizing proximity to them.\nA depiction of the observations on which control is performed – together with their corresponding state values and embeddings into latent space – is shown in Figure 2. The figure also clearly shows a fundamental advantage the E2C model has over its competitors: While the separately trained autoencoders make for aesthetically pleasing pictures, the models failed to discover the underlying structure of the state space, complicating dynamics estimation and largely invalidating costs based on distances in said space. Including the latent dynamics constraints in these end-to-end models on the other hand, yields latent spaces approaching the optimal planar embedding.\nWe test the long-term accuracy by accumulating latent and real trajectory costs to quantify whether the imagined trajectory reflects reality. The results for all models when starting from random positions at the top and executing 40 pre-computed actions are summarized in Table 1 – using a seperate test set for evaluating reconstructions. While all methods achieve a low reconstruction loss, the difference in accumulated real costs per trajectory show the superiority of the E2C model. Using the globally or locally linear E2C model, trajectories planned in latent space are as good as trajectories planned on the real state. All models besides E2C fail to give long-term predictions that result in good performance."

      "text" : "We next turn to the task of controlling the classical inverted pendulum system [15] from images. We create depictions of the state by rendering a fixed length line starting from the center of the image at an angle corresponding to the pendulum position. The goal in this task is to swing-up and balance an underactuated pendulum from a resting position (pendulum hanging down). Exemplary observations and reconstructions for this system are given in Figure 3(d). In the visual inverted pendulum task our algorithm faces two additional difficulties: the observed space is non-Markov, as the angular velocity cannot be inferred from a single image, and second, discretization errors due to rendering pendulum angles as small 48x48 pixel images make exact control difficult. To restore the Markov property, we stack two images (as input channels), thus observing a one-step history.\nFigure 3 shows the topology of the latent space for our model, as well as one sample trajectory in true state and latent space. The fact that the model can learn a meaningful embedding, separating\nvelocities and positions, from this data is remarkable (no other model recovered this shape). Table 1 again compares the different models quantitatively. While the E2C model is not the best in terms of reconstruction performance, it is the only model resulting in stable swing-up and balance behavior. We explain the failure of the other models with the fact that the non-linear latent dynamics model cannot be guaranteed to be linearizable for all control magnitudes, resulting in undesired behavior around unstable fixpoints of the real system dynamics, and that for this task a globally linear dynamics model is inadequate."

The latent space was set to be 8-dimensional in both experiments. The real state dimensionality for the cart-pole is four and is controlled using one\naction, while for the arm the real state can be described in 6 dimensions (joint angles and velocities) and controlled using a three-dimensional action vector corresponding to motor torques.\nAs in previous experiments the E2C model seems to have no problem finding a locally linear embedding of images into latent space in which control can be performed. Figure 4 depicts exemplary images – for both problems – from a trajectory executed by our system. The costs for these trajectories (11.13 for the cart-pole, 85.12 for the arm) are only slightly worse than trajectories obtained by AICO operating on the real system dynamics starting from the same start-state (7.28 and 60.74 respectively).

[17] for a review), deep autoencoders (ignoring state transitions) similar to our baseline models have been applied previously, e.g. by Lange and Riedmiller [18]. A more direct route to control based on image streams is taken by recent work on (model free) deep end-to-end Q-learning for Atari games by Mnih et al. [19], as well as kernel based [20] and deep policy learning for robot control [21].\nClose to our approach is a recent paper by Wahlström et al. [22], where autoencoders are used to extract a latent representation for control from images, on which a non-linear model of the forward dynamics is learned. Their model is trained jointly and is thus similar to the non-linear E2C variant in our comparison. In contrast to our model, their formulation requires PCA pre-processing and does neither ensure that long-term predictions in latent space do not diverge, nor that they are linearizable.\nAs stated above, our system belongs to the family of VAEs and is generally similar to recent work such as Kingma and Welling [6], Rezende et al. [7], Gregor et al. [23], Bayer and Osendorfer [24]. Two additional parallels between our work and recent advances for training deep neural networks can be observed. First, the idea of enforcing desired transformations in latent space during learning – such that the data becomes easy to model – has appeared several times already in the literature. This includes the development of transforming auto-encoders [25] and recent probabilistic models for images [26, 27]. Second, learning relations between pairs of images – although without control – has received considerable attention from the community during the last years [28, 29]. In a broader context our model is related to work on state estimation in Markov decision processes (see Langford et al. [30] for a discussion) through, e.g., hidden Markov models and Kalman filters [31, 32]."

      "text" : "A.1 State transition matrix factorization and KL Divergence\nAs alluded to in the main paper, estimation of the full local state transition matrix At ∈ Rnz×nz from Equation (8) requires the transition network to predict nz × nz parameters. Using an arbitrary state transition matrix also – inconveniently – requires inversion of said matrix for computing the KL divergence penalty from Equation (11) (through which it is hard to backpropagate). We started our experiments using a full matrix (and only approximating all KL divergence terms), but quickly found that a rank one pertubation of the identity matrix could be used instead without loss of performance in any of our benchmarks. To the contrary, the resulting networks have fewer parameters and are thus easier to train. We here give the derivation of this process and how the KL divergence from Equation (11) can be computed. For the reformulation we represent At as At = I+vtrTt , therefore only vt and rt need to be estimated by the transition network, reducing the number of outputs for At from n2z to 2nz .\nThe KL divergence between two multivariate Gaussians is given by\nKL(N0||N1) = 1\n2\n( Tr ( Σ−11 Σ0 ) + (µ1 − µ0)TΣ−11 (µ1 − µ0)− k + log ( det Σ1 det Σ0 )) .

To this end, we cannot take the trace or the determinant via numerical algorithms, because we have to be able to take the gradients in symbolic form. Aside from that, we like to process a batch of samples, so the computation should have a convenient form and not require excessive amounts of tensor products in between.

The difference of means can be derived very quickly with the same summing scheme:\n(µ1 − µ0)TΣ−11 (µ1 − µ0) = ∑ i (µ1 − µ0)2i σ21,i .\nIt remains the ratio of determinants, which we will simplify with the matrix determinant lemma giving\nlog\n( det Σ1\ndet AΣ0AT\n) = log det Σ1 − log det ( AΣ0A T )\n= log ∏ i σ21,i − log ( det A · det Σ0 · det AT ) detAT = detA\n= 2 ∑ i log σ1,i − log\n( (det A)2\n∏ i σ20,i\n) Matrix determinant lemma\n= 2 ∑ i log σ1,i − log ( 1 + vT r )2 − 2∑ i log σ0,i\n= 2 (∑ i ( log σ21,i − log σ20,i ) − log(1 + ∑ i viri) ) .\nPutting the above to formulas together finally yields\nKL(N0||N1) = 1\n2 (∑ i σ20,i + 2σ 2 0,iviri σ21,i + ∑ i r2i σ 2 i · ∑ i v2i σ2i\n(14)\n+ ∑ i (µ1 − µ0)2i σ21,i − k\n+ 2 (∑ i ( log σ21,i − log σ20,i ) − log(1 + ∑ i viri) )) ."

      "text" : "We used convolutional inference networks for the cart-pole and three-link arm task. While these networks help us overcome the problem of large input dimensionalities (i.e. 2 × 128 × 128 pixel\nimages in the three-link arm task), we still have to generate full resolution images with the decoder network. For high-dimensional images generation fully connected neural networks are simply not an option. We thus decided to use up-convolutional networks, which were recently show to be powerful models for image generation [8, 9, 33].\nTo set-up these models we basically “mirror” the convolutional architecture used for the encoder. More specifically for each 5 × 5 convolution followed by 2 × 2 max-pooling step in the encoder network, we introduce a 2 × 2 up-sampling and 5 × 5 convolution step in the decoder network. The complete network architecture is given below. It is similar to the up-convolution networks used in Dosovitskiy et al. [9]. The upsampling strategy we use is simple “perforated” upsampling as described in [34].\nB.2 Variational Autoencoder with slowness\nEnforcing temporal slowness during learning has previously been found to be a good proxy for learning representations in reinforcement learning [35, 36] and representation learning from videos [37]. We also consider a VAE variant with a slowness term on the latent representation by enforcing similarity of the encodings of temporally close images. This can be achieved by augmenting the standard VAE objective Lbound with an additional KL divergence term on the latent posterior Qφ:\nLslow(xt,xt+1) = KL(Qφ(zt+1|xt+1)‖Qφ(zt|xt)). (15)\nIndeed there seems to be a slightly better coherence of similar states in the latent spaces, as e.g. depicted in Figure 8 in the main paper. Yet, our experiments show that a slowness term alone does not suffice to structure the latent space, such that locally linear predictions and control become feasible."

      "heading" : "B.3 Evaluation criteria",
      "text" : "For comparing the performance of all variants of E2C and the baselines, the following criteria are of importance:\n• Autoencoding. Being able to reconstruct the given observations is the basic necessity for a model to work. The reconstruction cost drives a model to identify single states from its observations.\n• Decoding the next state. For any planning to be possible at all, the decoder must be able to generate the correct images from transitions the dynamics model performed. If this is not the case, we know that the latent states of the encoding and the transition model do not coincide, thus preventing any planning.\n• Optimizing latent trajectory costs. The action sequences for achieving a specified goal will be determined completely by locally linearized dynamics in the latent space. Therefore minimizing trajectory costs in latent space is, again, a necessity for successful control.\n• Optimizing real trajectory costs. While the action sequence has been determined for the latent dynamics, the deciding criterion is whether this reflects the true state trajectory costs. Therefore carrying out the ”dreamed” plans in reality is the optimality criterion for every model. To make the different models comparable, we use the same cost matrices for evaluation, which are not necessarily the same as for optimization.\nWe reflected these four criteria in the evaluation table in the paper. For the reconstruction of the current and next state we specified the mean log loss, which is in case of the Bernoulli distributions the cross entropy error function:\nlog p(x|x̂) = 1 N N∑ n=1 nx∑ i=0 xn,i log x̂n,i + (1− xn,i) log(1− x̂n,i). (16)\nFor the costs a model imagines and truly achieves, we sample from different starting states and accumulate the distances in latent and true state space according to the SOC method."

We simulated a fairly standard robot arm with three links. The length of the links were set to 2, 1.2 and 0.7 (units were set to meters). The masses of the corresponding links were all set to 10kg.\nB.5 Evaluating the true system model\nTo compare the efficacy of different models when combined with optimal control algorithms, we always reported the cost in latent space (as used by the optimal control algorithm) as well as the “real” trajectory cost. To compute this real cost, we evaluated the same cost function as in the latent space (quadratic costs on the deviation from a given goal state), but using the real system states during execution and different cost matrices for a fair comparison.\nAs an upper bound on the performance achievable for control by any of the models, we also computed the true system cost by applying iLQR/AICO to a model of the real system dynamics. We have this model available since all experiments were performed in simulation."

The slowness VAE was trained on the pairs of images subset Dpairs = {(x1,x2), . . . , (xT−1,xT )} and our E2C models on the full D. In order to learn dynamics predictions for the image-only autoencoders, we extracted the latent representations and combined them with the actions from D into Ddynamics = {(z1,u1, z2), . . . , (zT−1,uT−1, zT )}. On these low-dimensional representations we trained the dynamics MLPs, thus ensuring that all methods were trained on exactly the same data.\nB.6.2 Implementation details\nWe used orthogonal weight initialization for every layer [38]. As described in the main paper, Adam [14] was used as the learning rule for all networks. We found both these techniques to be fundamentally important for stabilizing training and achieving good reconstructions for all methods. Both methods also clearly helped to cut the hyperparameter search needed for all methods to a minimum. In the process of training, we could make out three phases: the unfolding of the latent space, the overcoming of the trivial solution (the average image of the dataset) and the minimization of the latent KL term. The architectures used for our experiments were as follows (where ReLU stands for rectified linear units [39] and conv. for convolutions):"

The long-term predictions by the E2C model are all of high quality. Note that for the uncontrolled dynamics the predictions show a slight bias of the pole moving to the right (an effect that we consistently saw in trained models for the cart-pole). We attribute this problem to the fact that discretization errors in the image rendering process of the pole angle make it hard to predict small velocities accurately.\nC.4 Exemplary trajectory taken for three-link arm task\nFigure 10 shows a segment of a controlled trajectory for the three-link arm as executed by the E2C system. Note that, in contrast to other figures in this supplementary material, it does not show a long-term prediction but rather 10 steps of a trajectory (together with one-step-ahead predictions) that was taken by the E2C system when combined with model predictive control. For additional visualizations and controlled trajectories for all tasks we refer to the supplementary video.\nC.5 Comparison of different models for cart-pole and robot arm\nIn Table 2 we compare our variety of models in terms of real trajectory cost and task success percentage on the cart-pole and the robot arm. All results are averaged over 30 different starting states with a fixed goal state.\nThe cart-pole always starts in the goal state (zero angle and zero velocity) with small additive Gaussian noise (σ = 0.01). Success is defined as preventing the pole from falling below an angle of ±0.85 rad. The three-link arm system begins in a random configuration and the goal is to to unroll all joints (e.g. make all angles zero) and stay -close to that position.\nThe results show that only E2C and its non-linear variant can perform this task successfully, although there is still a large performance gap between the two. We conclude, that the error of linearizing non-linear dynamics after training the corresponding model grows to the point of no longer allowing accurate control for the system."

E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems.",
