      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Sequential recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are remarkably effective models of natural language. In the last few years, language model results that substantially improve over long-established state-ofthe-art baselines have been obtained using RNNs (Zaremba et al., 2015; Mikolov et al., 2010) as well as in various conditional language modeling tasks such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), image caption generation (Xu et al., 2015), and dialogue generation (Wen et al., 2015). Despite these impressive results, sequential models are a priori inappropriate models of natural language, since relationships among words are organized in terms of latent nested structures rather than sequential surface order (Chomsky, 1957).\nIn this paper, we introduce recurrent neural network grammars (RNNGs; §2), a new generative probabilistic model of sentences that explicitly models nested, hierarchical relationships among words and phrases. RNNGs operate via a recursive syntactic process reminiscent of probabilistic context-free grammar generation, but decisions are parameterized using RNNs that condition on the entire syntactic derivation history, greatly relaxing context-free independence assumptions.\nThe foundation of this work is a top-down variant of transition-based parsing (§3). We give two variants of the algorithm, one for parsing (given an observed sentence, transform it into a tree), and one for generation. While several transition-based neural models of syntactic generation exist (Henderson, 2004; Emami and Jelinek, 2005; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Buys and Blunsom, 2015b), these rely on bottom-up construction of syntactic structure. Bottom-up construction orders are appealing since they permit well-known shift-reduce or leftcorner parsing algorithms to be exploited for inference; however, they limit the use of top-down grammar information, which is useful for generation (Roark, 2001). RNNGs maintain the algorithmic convenience of transition-based parsing but incorporate top-down syntactic information (§4).\nThe top-down transition set that RNNGs are based on lends itself to discriminative modeling as well, where sequences of transitions are modeled conditional on the full input sentence along with the incrementally constructed syntactic structures. Similar to previously published discriminative bottomup transition-based parsers (Henderson, 2004; Sagae and Lavie, 2005; Zhang and Clark, 2011, inter alia), greedy prediction with our model yields a lineartime deterministic parser (provided an upper bound on the number of actions taken between processing subsequent terminal symbols is imposed); however, our algorithm generates arbitrary tree structures directly, without the binarization required by shift-reduce parsers. The discriminative model also lets us use ancestor sampling to obtain samples of parse trees for sentences, and this is used to solve a second practical challenge with RNNGs: approximating the marginal likelihood and MAP tree of a sentence under the generative model. We present a simple importance sampling algorithm which uses samples from the discriminative parser to do inferar X iv :1 60 2. 07 77\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n5 Fe\nb 20\n16\nence problems in the generative model (§5). Experiments show that RNNGs are effective for both language modeling and parsing (§6). Our generative model obtains (i) the best-known parsing results using a supervised generative model and (ii) better perplexities in language modeling than state-of-the-art sequential LSTM language models. Surprisingly—although in line with previous parsing results showing the effectiveness of generative models (Henderson, 2004; Johnson, 2001)— parsing with the generative model obtains significantly better results than parsing with the discriminative model."

      "heading" : "3.1 Parser Transitions",
      "text" : "The parsing algorithm transforms a sequence of words x into a parse tree y using two data structures (a stack, an input buffer). As with the bottom-up algorithm of Sagae and Lavie (2005), our algorithm begins with the stack (S) empty and the complete sequence of words on the input buffer (B). The buffer contains unprocessed terminal symbols, and the stack contains terminal symbols, “open” nonterminal symbols, and completed constituents. One of\nthe following three operations (Fig. 1) are successively applied, based on the evolving contents of the stack and buffer:\n• NT(X) introduces an “open nonterminal” X onto the top of the stack. Open nonterminals are written as a nonterminal symbol preceded by an open parenthesis, e.g. (VP, and they represent a nonterminal whose child nodes have not yet been fully constructed. Open nonterminals will be “closed” to form complete subtrees by subsequent operations.\n• SHIFT removes the terminal symbol x from the front of the input buffer, and pushes it onto the top of the stack.\n• REDUCE repeatedly pops completed subtrees from the stack until an open nonterminal is encountered, and then this open NT is popped and used as the label of a new constituent that has the popped subtrees as its children. This new completed constituent is pushed onto the stack. A single REDUCE operation can thus create constituents with an unbounded number of children.\nThe parsing algorithm terminates when there is a single completed tree on the stack and the buffer is empty. Fig. 2 shows an example parse using our transition set. Note that in this paper we do not model preterminal symbols (i.e., part-of-speech tags) and our examples therefore do not include them.1\nOur transition set is closely related to the operations used in Earley’s algorithm which likewise introduces nonterminals symbols with its PREDICT operation and later COMPLETEs them after consuming terminal symbols one at a time using SCAN (Earley, 1970). It is likewise closely related to the “linearized” parse trees proposed by Vinyals et al. (2015) and to the top-down, left-to-right decompositions of trees used in by Roark (2001) and by Charniak (2010).\n1Preterminal symbols are, from the parsing algorithm’s point of view, just another kind of nonterminal symbol that requires no special handling. However, leaving them out reduces the number of transitions by O(n) and also reduces the number of action types, both of which reduce the runtime. Finally, standard parsing evaluation scores do not consider preterminals.\nConstraints on parser transitions. To guarantee that only well-formed phrase-structure trees are produced by the parser, we impose the following constraints on the transitions that can be applied at each step which are a function of the parser state (B,S, n) where n is the number of open nonterminals on the stack:\n• The NT(X) can only be applied if B is not empty and n < 100.2\n• The SHIFT operation can only be applied if B is not empty and n ≥ 1. • The REDUCE operation can only be applied if the\ntop of the stack is not an open nonterminal symbol. • The REDUCE operation can only be applied if n ≥\n2 or if the buffer is empty.\nTo designate the set of valid parser transitions, we write AD(B,S, n)."

      "text" : "The parsing algorithm that maps from sequences of words to parse trees can be adapted with minor changes to produce an algorithm that generates trees and sequences of words. There are two primary changes: (i) there is no input buffer of unprocessed words, rather there is an output buffer (T ), and (ii) instead of a SHIFT operation there is a GEN(x) operation which generates a terminal symbol x and adds it to the top of the stack and the output buffer. The algorithm terminates when a single tree remains on the stack. Fig. 4 shows an example generation sequence.\nConstraints on generator transitions. Since the generator algorithm state has replaced the input buffer with an output buffer, the parser constraints must be reformulated for the generator. These are:\n• The GEN(x) operation can only be applied if n ≥ 1. 2Since our parser allows unary nonterminal productions, there are an infinite number of valid trees for finite length sentences. The n < 100 constraint prevents the classifier from misbehaving and generating excessively large numbers of nonterminals. Similar constraints have been proposed to deal with the analogous problem in bottom-up shift-reduce parsers (Sagae and Lavie, 2005).\n• The REDUCE operation can only be applied if the top of the stack is not an open nonterminal symbol and n ≥ 1.\nTo designate the set of valid generator transitions, we write AG(T, S, n)."

Assuming the availability of constant time push and pop operations, the runtime is linear in the number of the nodes in the parse tree that is generated by the parser/generator (intuitively, this is true since although an individual REDUCE operation may require applying a number of pops that is linear in the number of input symbols, the total number of pops operations across an entire parse/generation run will also be linear). Since there is no way to bound the number of output nodes in a parse tree as a function of the number of input words, stating the runtime complexity of the parsing algorithm as a function of the input size requires further assumptions. Assuming our fixed constraint on maximum depth, it is linear."

Refer to Figure 5 for an illustration of the architecture.\nThe output buffer, stack, and history are sequences that grow unboundedly, and to obtain representations of them we use recurrent neural networks to “encode” their contents (Cho et al., 2014). Since the output buffer and history of actions are only appended to and only contain symbols from a finite alphabet, it is straightforward to apply a standard RNN encoding architecture. The stack (S) is more complicated for two reasons. First, the elements of the stack are more complicated objects than symbols from a discrete alphabet: open nonterminals, terminals, and full trees, are all present on the stack. Second, it is manipulated using both push and pop operations. To efficiently obtain representations of S under push and pop operations, we use stack LSTMs (Dyer et al., 2015). To represent complex parse trees, we define a new syntactic composition\nfunction that recursively defines representations of trees."

To compute an embedding of this new subtree, we use a composition function based on bidirectional LSTMs, which is illustrated in Fig. 6.\nAn embedding of the resulting constituent is the first element read by the LSTM in both the forward and reverse traversals of the embeddings of the child subtrees. Intuitively, this order serves to “notify” each LSTM what sort of head it should be looking for as it processes the child node embeddings. The final state of the LSTMs are concatenated, passed through an affine transformation and a tanh nonlinearity to become the subtree embedding.3 Because each of the child node embeddings (u, v, w in Fig. 6) is computed similarly (if it corresponds to an internal node), this composition function is a kind of recursive neural network."

To further reduce the computational complexity of modeling the generation of a word, we use a class-factored softmax (Baltescu and Blunsom, 2015; Goodman, 2001). By using √ |Σ| classes for a vocabulary of size |Σ|, this prediction step runs in time O( √ |Σ|) rather than the O(|Σ|) of the full-vocabulary softmax.

To evaluate this as a language model, it is necessary to compute the marginal probability p(x) =∑\ny′∈Y(x) p(x,y ′). And, to evaluate the model as a parser, we need to be able to find the MAP parse tree, i.e., the tree y ∈ Y(x) that maximizes p(x,y). However, because of the unbounded dependencies across the sequence of parsing actions in our model,\nexactly solving either of these inference problems is intractable. To obtain estimates of these, we use a variant of importance sampling (Doucet and Johansen, 2011).\nOur importance sampling algorithm uses a conditional proposal distribution q(y | x) with the following properties: (i) p(x,y) > 0 =⇒ q(y | x) > 0; (ii) samples y ∼ q(y | x) can be obtained efficiently; and (iii) the conditional probabilities q(y | x) of these samples are known. While many such distributions are available, the discriminatively trained variant of our parser (§4.4) fulfills these requirements: sequences of actions can be sampled using a simple ancestral sampling approach, and, since parse trees and action sequences exist in a one-to-one relationship, the product of the action probabilities is the conditional probability of the parse tree under q. We therefore use our discriminative parser as our proposal distribution.\nImportance sampling uses importance weights, which we define as w(x,y) = p(x,y)/q(y | x), to compute this estimate. Under this definition, we can derive the estimator as follows:\np(x) = ∑\ny∈Y(x)\np(x,y) = ∑\ny∈Y(x)\nq(y | x)w(x,y)\n= Eq(y|x)w(x,y).\nWe now replace this expectation with its Monte\nCarlo estimate as follows, using N samples from q:\ny(i) ∼ q(y | x) for i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , N}\nEq(y|x)w(x,y) MC ≈ 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nw(x,y(i))\nTo obtain an estimate of the MAP tree ŷ, we choose the sampled tree with the highest probability under the joint model p(x,y)."

This is the result of (i) relaxing conventional independence assumptions (e.g., context-freeness) and (ii) inferring continuous representations of symbols alongside non-linear models of their syntactic relationships. The most significant question that remains is why the discriminative model—which has more information available to it than the generative model—performs worse than the generative model. This pattern has been observed before in neural parsing by Henderson (2004), who hypothesized that larger, unstructured conditioning contexts are harder to learn from, and provide opportunities to overfit. Our discriminative model conditions on the entire history, stack, and buffer, while our generative model only accesses the history and stack. The fully discriminative model of Vinyals et al. (2015) was able to obtain results similar to those of our generative model (albeit using much larger training sets obtained through semisupervision) but similar results to those of our discriminative parser using the same data. In light of their results, we believe Henderson’s hypothesis is correct, and that generative models should be considered as a more statistically efficient method for\nlearning neural networks from small data."

Recurrent neural network language models use RNNs to compute representations of an unbounded history of words in a left-to-right language model (Zaremba et al., 2015; Mikolov et al., 2010; Elman, 1990). Syntactic language models jointly generate a syntactic structure and a sequence of words (Baker, 1979; Jelinek and Lafferty, 1991). There is an extensive literature here, but one strand of work has emphasized a bottom-up generation of the tree, using variants of shift-reduce parser actions to define the probability space (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Emami and Jelinek, 2005). The neuralnetwork–based model of Henderson (2004) is particularly similar to ours in using an unbounded history in a neural network architecture to parameterize a generative parsing model based on a leftcorner model. Dependency-only language models have also been explored (Titov and Henderson, 2007; Buys and Blunsom, 2015a; Buys and Blunsom, 2015b). Modeling generation top-down as a rooted branching process that recursively rewrites nonterminals has been explored by Charniak (2000) and Roark (2001).
