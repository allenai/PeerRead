      "heading" : "Introduction:",
      "text" : "Over the last decade researchers have begun focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) for real time strategy (RTS) games. RTS are popular computer games, which feature developing and supporting an army of different unit types and buildings. Unlike classical games, such as chess, players perform their actions in real time as oppose to turn based decisions. Additionally, players move simultaneously controlling potentially hundreds of units and buildings. To increase the difficulty of these games a player's knowledge of the playing map is restricted to a small area around their military assets and those of their allies.\nResearchers have generally limited their AI implementation to subcomponents of games,\nsuch as resource management or path finding [1]. That is to say, researchers have sought to develop a solution to a single aspect of RTS game. In recent years there has been a push to develop AI systems capable of playing the full game. However, these implementations are limited to playing a single RTS game. This leads to researchers leveraging expert knowledge and game specific information. Although, this results in improvement for the specific game it does not address the root concern of AI research, which is to develop agents that can autonomously interpret, learn, and apply new knowledge. In essence AI RTS agents are improving because of more efficient programing and better human implemented strategy and not because improvements in artificial intelligence.\nThe authors' assert the need for Real Time Strategy Language. Such a language would\nallow for the creation of an agent that can autonomously learn how to play a previously unknown game. These general gaming agents have been developed for relatively simple games such chess, tic-tac-toe, and more recently poker, they are known as General Game Playing (GGP) agents [2]. By allowing these GGP agents to play against one another over a variety of games it becomes apparent, which AI system is more adept at learning and applying knowledge.\nThere are several advantages to developing general RTS agents, which leverage the GGP\nmethodology. As these agents improve, measured by win percentage over both human and other AI opponents, it will be due to their ability to gather and apply new knowledge. This will demonstrate an improvement in our collective AI knowledge. Additionally, it will allow for faster development of new RTS games. Developing the AI scripts found in today’s games is a resource intensive project. The speed of game development will increase as AI systems become capable of learning how to play new RTS games. Lastly, general RTS agents will improve player experience. Traditional game AI systems are non-adaptive. Therefore, once the player has determined a weakness it becomes trivial to win. General RTS agents implement an adaptive learning system, thereby mitigating this problem [3].\nA Real Time Strategy Language needs to be developed first, which will allow for the\ndevelopment of a GGP agent for the RTS genera of games. This paper proposes a RTS language. The authors' appreciate the complexity of RTS games and therefore future iterations will expand on the language. It should be noted that this language is not designed encompass Non-Real Time Strategy Games."

      "heading" : "Language Structure",
      "text" : "The game description language was originally designed for turn based perfect information, symmetric games. It was later augmented to include imperfect information game. Each turn a player is given propositions, which are true in the given state. Additionally, the player is given possible steps that can be made from that state and how they will affect the game. The problem with this formulation is that as the game increase in complexity so does the number of propositions needed to describe the game state. In addition, the number of possible actions and transitions also increase with complexity [5].\nReal time strategy (RTS) games are not conducive to the original format of GDL. Turn\nbased updates are unfeasible for RTS game because they are played over a continuous timeframe. Furthermore, a player can control hundreds of buildings and units, leading to an exponential growth in possible actions and state transitions. Therefore, defining propositions for an RTS game's possible states and transitions is impracticable.\nFor an autonomous system to be competitive it must be able to act based on an internal\nview of the world. Parsing updates takes time, which limits the autonomous agent’s ability to perform useful actions in the RTS game. Lewis et al, found a correlation between winning a game and the action rate of players [6]. A player that performs more actions than their opponent improves their position faster and thus giving them an advantage. Although, this is correlation and not causation it highlights the need for efficient updates, which is not possible under the current GDL language format.\nThe autonomous system could reconcile any errors in its internal view with periodic\nupdates. Such a system would need a basic understanding of the game, prior to learning game specific information. In other words, the system should understand it is playing an RTS game and can assume that an army is made up of units, which will occupy a world. This allows for time saving domain knowledge to be added into the system.\nAs aforementioned, currently there is no autonomous agent that can beat an expert human\nin RTS games. Therefore, domain knowledge should be available to the autonomous agent. Leveraging domain knowledge limits the amount of information the autonomous agent needs to learn and may result in better performance. Additionally, it does not violate the core goal of AI research, which is to develop agents that learns and utilizes knowledge autonomously. An agent will still need to learn and utilize game specific information. To develop such an agent a RTS language needs to be created. The next section proposes a Real Time Strategy language."

      "heading" : "Faction Description",
      "text" : "The game description can be split broadly into two segments. The first segment described here is the faction description. This describes the factions that can comprise the game, along with their buildings and units. As the description below demonstrates, Factions contain Human and Orc. Meaning there consist two factions named Human and Orc respectively. It is important to note that the Human and Orc is game specific information and can easily be renamed. The Resources denote what resources are available in the game. At the beginning of the game a player will have 100 pieces of wood for use. As with factions resources are game specific information\n<Factions>\nHuman Orc\n</Factions > <Resource>\n<Wood> 100 </Wood> <Gold> 100 </Gold> <Oil> 10 </Oil> <Food> 5 </Food>\n</Resource>\nIn many RTS games races have different buildings and units, with different abilities. To\naccommodate game specific tags are used specify the properties of that object. Below is an example of a building specification.\n<Humans>\n<Building>\n<Town Hall>\n<UniqueID>TownHall1</UniqueID> <Health Point>1200</Health Point> <Terrain>\nGround\n</Terrain> <Action>Idle</Action> <Shape>\n<Square> 2 </Square>\n</Shape> <Position>\n<X,Y>120,120 </X,Y>\n</Position> <Vision> 1 </Vision> <Build Speed> 30 </ Build Speed> <Enemy></Enemy> <Require>\n<Resource>\n<Wood> 800 </Wood> <Gold> 1200 </Gold>\n</Resource>\n</Require> <Upgrade>Keep</Upgrade> <Purpose>\n<Process>\n<Resource>\nWood Gold\n</Resource>\n</Process> < Build > Peasants </ Build >\n</Purpose>\n</Town Hall>\n</Building>\n</Human>\nThe building described is a town hall, which can be constructed by the faction known as\nhuman. The town all is comprised of 1200 health points, is constructed in the shape of a square, with each side being 2 units in distance. Enemies passing within in 1 unit of distance will be seen. It will take 30 seconds for the building to be constructed and will require 800 gold pieces and 1200 wood pieces. This structure can be upgraded to a Keep. The town hall has several purposes; it processes wood and gold adding them to the user bank. Additionally, it can train the unit know as Peasants.\nThe above description contains a mixture of keywords and game specific information.\nThe tags that are bolded are keywords and can be found in the definition section. As stated earlier inner tags are properties of outer tags. That is to say Humans can construct buildings and one of their buildings is known as a Town hall, which requires 800 pieces of wood to construct. This hierarchal structure allows buildings to be described using a combination of keywords and game specific information. The same can be done for units.\n<Human>\n<Unit>\n<Elvin Archer>\n<Health Point> 40</Health Point> < Build Time> 15 </ Build Time> <UniqueID> Archer1</UniqueID> <Armor>\n<Shield> 4 </Shield>\n</Armor> <Shape> Circle </Shape> <Size> 0.5 </Size> <Enemy></Enemy> <Action>Idle</Action> <Position>\n<X,Y>120,120 </X,Y>\n</Position> <Attack>\n<Arrow>\n<Range>4</Range> <Damage>3-9 </Damage> <Recharge>2 </Recharge>\n</Arrow>\n</Attack> <Terrain>\nGround\n<Terrain> <Vision>5</Vision> <Speed>3</Speed>\n<Require>\n<Resource>\n<Gold> 500 </Gold> <Wood> 50 </Wood> <Food> 1 </Food>\n</Resource>\n</Require>\n</Elvin Archer>\n</Unit>\n</Human>\nAbove is a description of the Elvin Archer. The description provides information of the\nElvin Archer Defensive and offensive capabilities. For example, the archer carriers a shield which will decrease any attack damage by 4 points. Additionally, the archer takes two seconds between firing arrows. These arrows can be targeted at units in the air and on the snow. The previous two examples demonstrate how units and buildings can be described in RTS games. More advance descriptions will be covered in the keyword section. The next section will discuss how to describe the environment."
    }, {
      "heading" : "Environment Description",
      "text" : "Maps describe the environment in which the game is played. This is where different terrains are specified, as well as the amount and location of different resources. Below is a brief example of the map specification system. <Map>\n<Name> Hills </Name> <(0,0)>\n<Terrain>\nGround High Air\n</Terrain> <Gold>1000</Gold>\n</(0,0)> <(0,1)>\n<Terrain>\n<Wood>300</Wood>/Ground Low Air\n</Terrain>\n</(0,1)>\n</Map>\nThe above specification demonstrates several complex features. In the first cell the terrain\nis specified as high ground and air but there is a gold deposit worth 1000 units on it. That is to say, units that can pass through air or ground can occupy this space. In the second cell the terrain starts as wood but once the 300 units of wood is removed it becomes low ground, this allows for the generation of temporary obstructions.\nWhen an RTS AI receives an update from the game engine about the state of the\nenvironment, there is a large amount of data that is given. However, the XML structure allows for rapid parsing of the data into relevant information. For example, in a standard 128 X 128 map there is information about 16,384 grid cells. However, like human players a RTS AI agent will only care about a small subset of these cells at any one time, specifically the cells that are within the vision of its buildings and units."

      "heading" : "Game Management",
      "text" : "The RTS game management system has already been developed for artificial intelligence competition. The game management system accepts the connection of an AI system. The system designates which faction it intends to play as. The game manager selects a map, informs the AI system of their opponent’s race, and sends a signal when the match begins.\nThe game management system maintains the true state of the game. That is to say the\ngame management system keeps track of units, buildings, resources and map conditions. AI systems store separately what they believe to be the true state of the world. By querying the game management system for updates about the current state of the map, a player’s stored state can be brought into alignment with current state of the game. Below is a diagram of the system combined with the RTS language. The aforementioned system has been used by AI StarCraft competition for the past several years.\nThe authors’ contend that there is no need for the underlying system to be modified.\nRather the messages should be standardized, thus allowing an AI to interact with any RTS game. For standardization purposes updates of the system should be given in the aforementioned formats. The information given to the AI system should be limited by the vision of the AI’s current units and buildings.\nIn RTS games there are several actions that a player can take. The RTS language has\ndeveloped keywords for the following task:\n1. Construct Building – Construct(buildingName, X-position, Y-position) 2. Move a Unit or Building – Move(Unique ID, X-Position, Y- Position) 3. Train – Train(Training location Unique ID, Name of unit/upgrade), 4. Gather Resource – Gather(Unit Unique ID, X-Position, Y-Position) 5. Attack – (Allied Unique ID, Enemy Unique ID) 6.

Additionally, the property of the grid box that is formed by 4 pairs of x and y coordinates is defined by the lowest x and y coordinate. <0, 0 >\n<Terrain> Sea\n</Terrain> </0, 0> <1, 0 >\n<Terrain> Grass\n</Terrain> </1, 0> <0, 1 >\n<Terrain> Grass\n</Terrain> </0, 1> <1, 1 >\n<Terrain> Dirt\n</Terrain> </1, 1>\n0,0 0,1 1,0 1,1"
