      "text" : "Con eptual graphs (CGs) have been proposed as a knowledge representation and reasoning model, mathemati ally founded both on logi s and graph theory (Sowa, 1984). Though they have been mainly studied as a graphi al interfa e for logi s or as a diagrammati system of logi s (for instan e, see Wermelinger, 1995, for general CGs equivalent to FOL), their graph-theoreti foundations have been less investigated. Most works in this area are limited to simple on eptual graphs, or simple graphs (Sowa, 1984; Chein & Mugnier, 1992), whi h\norrespond to the positive, onjun tive and existential fragment of FOL without fun tions.\nThis model has three fundamental hara teristi s:\n1. obje ts are bipartite labelled graphs (nodes represent entities and relations between\nthese entities);\n2. reasonings are based on graph-theoreti operations, relying on a kind of graph homo-\nmorphism alled proje tion;\n3. it is logi ally founded, reasonings being sound and omplete w.r.t. FOL semanti s,\nusually by way of the translation alled .\nMain extensions of the simple graphs model, keeping graph homomorphism based operations and sound and omplete semanti s, are inferen e rules (Gosh & Wuwongse, 1995; Salvat & Mugnier, 1996; Salvat, 1998) and nested graphs (Chein, Mugnier, & Simonet, 1998; Preller, Mugnier, & Chein, 1998); for general CGs equivalent to FOL, an original dedu tion\n2002 AI A ess Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nBaget & Mugnier\nsystem (Kerdiles, 1997) ombines analyti tableaux with the simple graphs proje tion. Some kind of onstraints have been proposed to validate a knowledge base omposed of simple graphs (Mineau & Missaoui, 1997; Dibie, Haemmerlé, & Loiseau, 1998).\nWe present here a family of extensions of the simple graphs model. The ommon ground for these extensions is that obje ts are olored simple graphs representing fa ts, rules or\nonstraints, and operations are based upon proje tion. Given a knowledge base K and a simple graph Q (whi h may represent a query, a goal, . . . , depending on the appli ation), the dedu tion problem asks whether Q an be dedu ed from K. A ording to the kinds of obje ts\nonsidered in K, di erent reasoning models are obtained, omposing the SG family. Though similar notions of rules and onstraints an be found in the CG literature, their ombination in reasonings had never been studied. One interest of our approa h thus resides in providing a unifying framework ombining rules and onstraints in di erent ways.\nIn this paper, we fo us on the formal de nitions of these models, in luding their operational semanti s and relationships with FOL, and we study the de idability and omplexity of their asso iated de ision problems, namely onsisten y and dedu tion. These results extend and omplete the ones already published by the authors (Baget & Mugnier, 2001). Though both onsisten y and dedu tion are unde idable in the most general model of this family, we had already used a de idable subset of rules to solve the Sisyphus-I problem, a test-bed proposed in the knowledge a quisition ommunity (Baget, Genest, & Mugnier, 1999). We present here for the rst time a detailed analysis of omplexity when we restri t the knowledge base to this kind of rules ( alled range restri ted rules). We also study parti ular ases of onstraints.\nIn se tion 2 basi de nitions and results about simple graphs are re alled. Se tion 3 presents an overview of the SG family. In parti ular, we explain why we onsider graphi al features of the simple graphs model as essential for knowledge modeling and point out that these properties are preserved in the SG family. In next se tions we study the di erent members of the family. Rules are introdu ed in se tion 4, onstraints in se tion 5, and se tion 6 studies models ombining rules and onstraints. As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, the asso iated de ision problems are not de idable, but we exhibit a ondition ( nite expansion sets) under whi h omputations always stop. In the parti ular ase of range restri ted rules, the omplexity of these problems fall into the polynomial hierar hy. Se tion 7 is devoted to these de idable ases. In se tion 8, relationships with other works are established. In parti ular we point out algorithmi onne tions with onstraint satisfa tion problems (CSP) and show that the problem of he king the onsisten y of a knowledge base omposed of simple graphs and onstraints (SGC- onsisten y) is equivalent to that of de iding the onsisten y of a mixed CSP (MIXED-SAT, Fargier, Lang, & S hiex, 1996)."

      "text" : "Basi ontologi al knowledge is en oded in a stru ture alled a support. Fa tual knowledge is en oded into simple graphs (SGs), de ned with respe t to a given support. A SG is a bipartite labelled graph (stri tly speaking, it is a multigraph, sin e there an be several edges between two nodes). One lass of nodes represents entities, the other lass represents relationships between these entities. Nodes are labelled by elements of the support. Elementary reasonings are omputed by a graph homomorphism alled proje tion.\nDe nition 1 (Support) A support is a 4-tuple S = (T\nC\n; T\nR\n;I; ). T\nC\nand T\nR\nare two\npartially ordered nite sets, respe tively of on ept types and relation types. T\nR\nis par-\ntitioned into subsets T\n1 R : : : T k R of relation types of arity 1 : : : k respe tively (k 1). Two\nelements of distin t subsets are in omparable. Both orders on T\nC\nand T\nR\nare denoted by\n(x y means that x is a subtype of y). I is the set of individual markers. T\nC\n, T\nR\nand I\nare pairwise disjoint. is a mapping from I to T\nC\n. We denote by the generi marker,\nwhere =2 I. A partial order on I [ f g onsiders elements of I as pairwise in omparable, and as its greatest element.\nAll partial orders will be denoted by , and, if needed, indexed by the name of the set on whi h they are de ned. In this paper the intuitive meaning of x y is always x is a spe ialization of y. Fig. 1 partially des ribes a support, whi h will be used in further examples.\nPSfrag repla ements\nDe nition 2 (Simple Graph) A simple graph G, de ned over a support S, is a nite bipartite multigraph (V = (V\nC\n; V\nR\n); U; ). V\nC\nand V\nR\nare the node sets, respe tively of\non ept nodes and of relation nodes. U is the multiset of edges. Edges in ident on a relation node are totally ordered; they are numbered from 1 to the degree of the node. An edge numbered i between a relation node r and a on ept node is denoted by (r; i; ) and identi es a unique element of U . U will also be seen as a set of su h triples.\nEa h node has a label given by the mapping . A relation node r is labelled by type(r),\nan element of T\nR\n, alled its type, and the degree of r must be equal to the arity of type(r).\nThus, if r 2 T\nk R , jf(r; i; )j(r; i; ) 2 Ugj = k and fij(r; i; ) 2 Ug = f1; ::: kg. A on ept\nBaget & Mugnier\nnode is labelled by a pair (type( ), marker( )), where type( ) is an element of T\nC\n, alled\nits type, and marker( ) is an element of I [ f g, alled its marker. If marker( ) is an individual marker m, then type( )= (m).\nA on ept node with a generi marker is alled a generi node (it refers to an unspe i ed\nentity of a ertain type); otherwise it is alled an individual node (it refers to a spe i individual de ned in the support). We will adopt the following lassi al onventions about SGs. In the drawing of a SG, on ept nodes are represented by re tangles and relation nodes by ovals. In textual notation, re tangles are repla ed by [℄ and ovals by (). Generi markers are omitted. Thus a generi on ept label (t; ) is simply noted t. An individual\non ept label (t;m) is noted t : m. When in our examples we use binary relations, we may repla e numbers on edges by dire ted edges: a binary relation node is then in ident to exa tly one in oming and one outgoing edge. Fig. 2 shows two ( onne ted) simple graphs G and Q assumed to be de ned over the support of Fig. 1. PSfrag repla ements\nThe elementary reasoning operation, proje tion, is a kind of graph homomorphism that preserves the partial order de ned on labels. Let us rst pre ise this order for on ept node labels. We have de ned the following partial order on the marker set I [ f g: is the greatest element (for all m 2 I, m ) and elements of I are pairwise non omparable. Then the partial order on on ept node labels is the produ t of the partial orders on T\nC\nand\nI [ f g, i.e. (t;m) (t\n0\n;m\n0\n) i t t\n0\nand m m\n0\n. In other words, a on ept label (t;m) is\nmore spe i than a on ept label (t\n0\n;m\n0\n) if t is a subtype of t\n0\nand, if m\n0\n= , then m an\nbe any marker, otherwise m must be equal to m\n0\n.\nDe nition 3 (Proje tion) Let Q and G be two SGs de ned on a support S. A proje tion from Q into G is a mapping from V\nC\n(Q) to V\nC\n(G) and from V\nR\n(Q) to V\nR\n(G) whi h\npreserves edges (it is a bipartite graph homomorphism) as well as their numbering, and may spe ialize on ept and relation node labels:\n1. 8(r; i; ) 2 U(Q); ( (r); i; ( )) 2 U(G);\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\n2. 8x 2 V (Q); ( (x)) (x)\nWe note Q G (Q subsumes G) if there exists a proje tion from Q into G. Typi ally, Q represents a query, G a fa t, and proje tions from Q to G de ne answers to Q. In Fig. 2, suppose Resear her Person, then there is one proje tion from Q into G. The image of Q by this proje tion is the subgraph G 0 of G."

Given a support S, a onstant is assigned to ea h individual marker and an n-adi (resp. a unary) predi ate is assigned to ea h n-adi relation (resp. on ept) type. For simpli ity, we onsider that ea h onstant or predi ate has the same name as the asso iated element of the support. A set of formulas (S) is assigned to any support S, translating partial orders on types. More spe i ally, for all distin t types t\n1\nand t\n2\nsu h that t\n2\nt\n1\n, one has the\nformula 8x\n1\n:::x\np\n(t\n2\n(x\n1\n; :::; x\np\n) ! t\n1\n(x\n1\n; :::; x\np\n)), where p = 1 for on ept types, and p is\notherwise the arity of the relation type. Given any SG G, a formula (G) is built as follows. A term is assigned to ea h on ept node: a distin t variable for ea h generi node, and the\nonstant orresponding to its marker otherwise. Then an atom t( ) (resp. t(\n1\n; ::: ;\nk\n)) is\nasso iated to ea h on ept node (resp. relation node r of arity k), where t is the type of the node, and (resp.\ni\n) is the term assigned to this node (resp. assigned to the ith neighbour\nof r).

Figure 3 shows a ounter-example to proje tion ompleteness when SGs are not in normal form: G for instan e does not proje t to H, even if both SGs have the same logi al semanti s, but it proje ts to nf (H).

Then Q nf(G) if and only if (S); (G) (Q).\nBaget & Mugnier\nWe laimed in the introdu tion that SGs are equivalent to the positive, onjun tive and existential fragment of FOL without fun tions (let us denote it by FOL(^, 9)). One embedding is immediate (from FOL to SGs), but requires the de nition of a support that does not add anything to the semanti s of the involved graphs. A at support is a support whose translation by is empty, i.e. where all distin t types are non omparable. If V is the vo abulary ( onstants and predi ates) for a set of formulas, we onsider the at support S\nf\n(V ) = (T\nC\n; T\nR\n;I) where T\nC\nis restri ted to the element >\nC\n, the relation types of T\ni R are\nthe predi ates of arity i in V , and the individual markers of I are the onstants in V .\nProperty 1 (Embedding FOL(^, 9) into SG) There is a bije tion f2g mapping the set of FOL(^, 9) formulas over a vo abulary V to the set of normal SGs de ned on the at support S\nf\n(V ) su h that, for any two formulas g and h, g h i there is a proje tion from\nf2g(h) into f2g(g).\nProof: Let f be a FOL(^, 9) formula over a vo abulary V . The SG f2g(f) de ned on the support S\nf\n(V ) is built as follows: to ea h term of f we asso iate a on ept node typed\n>\nC\n(generi if the term is a variable, individual with a marker if the term is the onstant\n), and to ea h atom t(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nq\n) we asso iate a relation node r typed t, su h that, for\n1 i q, the ith neighbor of r is the on ept node asso iated to x\ni\n.\nThe mapping f2g is learly inje tive, i.e. it maps di erent formulas (not identi al up to variable renaming) to di erent SGs (not identi al up to an isomorphism). Moreover, it is a bije tion if we restri t SGs to those in normal form.\nLet us now onsider the FOL(^, 9) formula f = 9~x\ni\n( (~x\ni\n)) (where (~x\ni\n) is a onjun tion\nof atoms whose variables belong to ~x\ni\n). The >\nC\n-enri hed formula of f is the formula\nte(f) = 9~x\ni\n( (~x\ni\n) ^ (~x\ni\n)) where (~x\ni\n) is the onjun tion of the atoms >\nC\n(x), for every\nterm x in f . We now prove the property by pointing out that, 1) for f and g two FOL(^, 9) formulas, f g i te(f) te(g), and 2) for any FOL(^, 9) formula f , te(f) = (f2g(f)), and on lude using Th. 1. 2\nFor the other dire tion, the apparent problem is that formulas assigned to the support by are universally quanti ed and are used in the dedu tion pro ess. However, we an do without them, by en oding the partial order on types dire tly in the SGs.\nProperty 2 (Embedding SG into FOL(^, 9)) There is a inje tive appli ation g2f mapping the set of normal SGs de ned on a support S to the set of FOL(^, 9) formulas su h that, for any two SGs G and H de ned on S, there is a proje tion from H into G i g2f(G) g2f(H).\nProof: Let G be a graph de ned on a support S. The expansion of G, exp(G), is the SG de ned on the at support S\nf\n(V ) (where V is the vo abulary for the formulas of (S)),\nbuilt as follows: 1) for every on ept node x = [t : m℄ of G, exp(G) ontains an asso iated\non ept node x\n0\n= [>\nC\n: m℄, s.t., for ea h on ept type t\n0\n2 S greater or equal to t, a unary\nrelation node of type t\n0\nlinked to x\n0\nand 2) for every relation node x of G (of type r and\narity k), for every relation type r\n0\n2 S s.t. r r\n0\n, we add in exp(G) a relation node typed\nr\n0\nwith same neighbors as x. We now de ne the appli ation g2f as Æ exp, and on lude\nusing Th. 1, noti ing that (S\nf\n(V )) = ;.\n2\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nUsing similar transformations, a lose relationship to the problem of query ontainment studied in the database eld has been shown: he king query ontainment for non re ursive\nonjun tive queries is equivalent to he king proje tion between SGs (Chein et al., 1998;\nMugnier, 2000)."

In the following de nition, for instan e, the SG G represents a set of SGs.\nDe nition 4 (SG-dedu tion) Let G and Q be two SGs de ned on a support S. Q an be dedu ed from G if Q G.\nChein and Mugnier (1992) have shown that proje tion he king is NP- omplete with a redu tion from lique. Equivalen e with CSP (satis ability of a onstraint network) was also used later (Feder & Vardi, 1993; Mugnier & Chein, 1996), and independently in a very similar model by Rudolf (1998) (see part 8 of this paper). We give below another proof of this result based on a redu tion from 3-SAT. Though more ompli ated than the previous ones, this redu tion is the basis for other redu tions presented later in this paper.\nThe following theorem keeps into a ount the omplexity of on ept and relation type he king, though in this paper this test an obviously be performed in polynomial time sin e on ept and relation types are only labels partially ordered in a hierar hy.\nTheorem 2 (Chein & Mugnier, 1992) SG-dedu tion is a NP- omplete problem, i type he king in S belongs to NP.\nProof: First see that if type he king is in NP, then SG-dedu tion is also in NP: a proje tion, enri hed by erti ates for all type he ks used, is a polynomial erti ate. The re ipro al is obviously true. We now show that, even if type he king an be done in (1), SG-dedu tion is NP- omplete.\nLet us now build a redu tion from 3-SAT. The input of 3-SAT is a formula F in 3- onjun tive normal form (3-CNF), i.e. a onjun tion of disjun tions ( lauses), ea h with at most three literals, and the question is whether there is a truth assignment of the variables of F su h that F is true. Noti e the lassi al 3-SAT problem onsiders lauses with exa tly three literals, but for further proofs we prefer to use the above variant.\nLet F = C\n1\n^ : : : ^ C\nk\nbe an instan e of 3-SAT. W.l.o.g. we suppose that ea h variable\nappears at most on e in a lause. Let us reate four on ept types for ea h variable x: x, xf, xt and xv. We also reate one relation type C\ni\nfor ea h lause C\ni\n, and a relation type val.\nEa h on ept type xv is greater than xt and xf, these are the only possible omparisons between distin t types.\nWe build the graph G(F) as follows: for every variable x in F , we have three on ept nodes [x℄, [xt℄ and [xf℄ in G(F) and two relation nodes typed val linking the rst to the latter ones (intuitively, it means that the variable x an be valuated by true or false).

      "text" : "A modeling viewpoint From a modeling viewpoint, we see two essential properties in the simple graph model. The obje ts, simple graphs, are easily understandable by an enduser (a knowledge engineer or even an expert). And reasonings are easily understandable too, for two reasons: proje tion is a graph mat hing operation, thus easily interpretable and visualisable; and the same language is used at interfa e and operational levels.\nAlthough there is a gap between the theoreti al foundations studied here and a language usable in real appli ations, we would like to brie y mention two proje ts in whi h these properties have been exhibited. The rst one is an experiment in do ument retrieval done by Genest (2000). In this work, on eptual graphs are used to de ne a language for indexing and querying do uments. Con ept types are taken from the thesaurus of RAMEAU (about 400 000 types), a do umentary language used in most fren h publi and universitary libraries. The experiment proved the feasibility of the proposed system (w.r.t. omputing time) and an improved relevan e w.r.t. to the existing system based upon RAMEAU, mainly due to the use of semanti relations instead of keywords only. One side e e t was also to prove the interest of simple graphs from a modeling viewpoint. Indeed, their graphi al properties enabled to build an indexing/querying tool that was onsidered as easy to use for the indexers. The users were master humanities students, not aware from on eptual graphs neither from RAMEAU; with the software and an indexing guide, they be ame qui kly able to build indexations, that were onsidered of high quality by a senior librarian.\nThe se ond proje t takes pla e in knowledge engineering (Bos, Botella, & Vanheeghe, 1997). Its purpose is the onstru tion of tools for modeling and simulating human organizations, as emergen y pro edures for instan e. One main di ulty in knowledge engineering is to validate a modeling, i.e. to he k that the expert reasoning is orre tly modeled. This validation is usually done when the design is a hieved, here by simulating the onstru ted modeling of the organization. At this nal stage, modi ations are very ostly. The key idea of the proje t is to over ome this di ulty by giving the expert the ability to use simulation inside the design y le as a mean of enri hing and building his modeling. This implies that the hosen modeling language enables the expert to follow reasonings step by step, dire tly on his own modelization. It was de ided to build su h a language upon on eptual graphs. General on eptual graphs equivalent to FOL were not onsidered as good andidates be-\nause they are indeed a diagrammati system of logi that is not at the expert level. Instead, the language was grounded upon simple graphs and extensions (su h as nestings of graphs) keeping their readability. Operations mixed simple graph dedu tion (i.e. proje tion) with non de larative pro edures. First experiments were on lusive.\nA omputational viewpoint From a omputational viewpoint, we think that graphbased reasonings, bene tting from graph-theoreti al results, an bring an interesting perspe tive to logi programming. By example, the equivalen e between SG proje tion and\nBaget & Mugnier\ndedu tion in FOL(^;9) an be seen as an alternative version of the homomorphism theorem (Chandra & Merlin, 1977), onsidered as fundamental for database queries optimization (Abiteboul, Hull, & Vianu, 1995). Other results are obtained from onstraint programming. The strong equivalen e between SG-dedu tion and the Constraint Satisfa - tion Problem (see Se t. 8, where the transformations used keep all solutions and preserve the stru ture of the onstraint network in the query) allows to translate the results obtained in this latter ommunity (by example, tra table ases based upon the stru ture of the graph, Gottlob, Leone, & S ar ello, 1999), rst to SG-dedu tion, then to dedu tion in FOL(^;9).\nThe graph stru ture an also be used to develop e ient algorithms in more general models of the SG family: in the model we all SR (see below), Coulondre and Salvat (1998) use the graph-based notion of pie e to build an e ient ba kward- haining algorithm. To enhan e the forward- haining algorithm used in the more general models of the SG family, Baget (2001) expresses dependen ies between rules and onstraints in terms of a graph homomorphism.\nOur aim is thus to build formal extensions of simple on eptual graphs, keeping readability of obje ts as well as reasonings, and preferably, logi ally founded. The SG family is a rst step in this dire tion."

A ording to the kinds of obje ts omposing K, one obtains the di erent members of the family. In the basi model SG, K is omposed of a set G of simple graphs representing fa ts, and solving Dedu tion amounts to he k whether there is a proje tion from Q into G. Rules and onstraints are more omplex obje ts based upon simple graphs, and operations dealing with these obje ts are based upon proje tion.\nThroughout this se tion, we will use examples inspired from a modelization of a knowledge a quisition ase study, alled Sysiphus-I: it des ribes a resour e allo ation problem, where the aim is to assign o es to persons of a resear h group while ful lling some onstraints (Baget et al., 1999).\nRules A rule expresses knowledge of form if A is present then B an be added .

The rule R\n3\nsays that every resear her is member of a proje t ( if there is a resear her\nx, there is a proje t of whi h x is a member ).\nRules are used to enri h fa ts: if the hypothesis of a rule an be proje ted into a SG, then the rule is appli able to this SG, and its on lusion an be added to the SG a ording to the proje tion. Noti e that ea h proje tion of a same rule to a SG de nes a di erent way of applying this rule and is likely to add new information to the SG.

There\nare two ways of applying this rule, depending on whether its hypothesis is mapped onto the path [Offi e:#1℄->(adjoin)->[Offi e:#2℄->(adjoin)->[Offi e:#3℄ or onto the path [Offi e:#2℄->(adjoin)->[Offi e: #3℄->(adjoin)->[Offi e:#4℄. In the rst\nase for instan e, a relation node (near) with prede essor [Offi e:#1℄ and su essor [Offi e:#3℄ is added to the SG. Noti e that in this example, applying all rules in all possible ways as long as they add new information is a nite pro ess (leading to the graph H of Figure 6) but it is not true in general.\nWhen the KB is omposed of a set of fa ts G and a set of rules R, the Dedu tion problem asks whether there is a sequen e of rule appli ations enri hing the fa ts su h that the goal Q an be rea hed, i.e. leading to a graph into whi h the SG Q an be proje ted. E.g.\nonsider the fa t G of Figure 6, and let Q be the SG [Offi e:#4℄->(near)->[Offi e℄ ( is #4 near an o e? ). Q does not proje t into G, but applying the rules, one adds the information [Offi e:#4℄->(near)->[Offi e:#3℄ (also [Offi e:#4℄->(near)->[Offi e:#2℄), thus answering Q.\nConstraints A onstraint an be positive or negative, expressing knowledge of form if A holds, so must B , or if A holds, B must not . It is also a bi olored simple graph: the rst olor de nes the ondition part (or trigger), and the se ond olor the mandatory (or forbidden) part. A SG G satis es a positive onstraint C if ea h proje tion from the\nondition part of C into G an be extended to a proje tion of the whole C. And G satis es a negative onstraint if no proje tion of the ondition of C into G an be extended to a proje tion of the whole C. Fig. 7 shows two onstraints. The negative onstraint C\n1\nBaget & Mugnier\n1\n2\nexpresses that two persons working together should not share an o e . The SG G of Fig 2 does not satisfy this onstraint be ause there is a resear her who works with resear her K (proje tion of the ondition part of C1) and they share o e #124 (extension of the proje tion to a proje tion of the whole C1). The positive onstraint C\n2\nexpresses that the\no e of a head of group must be near the o es of all se retaries.\nWhen the KB is omposed of a set of fa ts G and a set of onstraints C, the role of onstraints is to de ne the onsisten y of the base, i.e. of G. The base is said to be onsistent if all onstraints are satis ed. Provided that the base is onsistent, dedu tion is done as in SG. Even if they are both bi olored graphs, onstraints are not to be onfused with rules. Consider for instan e the bi olored graph R\n3\nof Figure 5: as a rule, it says that\nevery resear her is a member of a proje t. Take the fa t G = [Resear her:K.℄ and the query Q=[Resear her:K.℄->(member)->[Proje t℄ ( is K. member of a proje t? ). If Q is asked on K = (G;R = fR3g), the answer is yes . Now, see R\n3\nas a positive onstraint C. It\nsays that every resear her must be a member of a proje t. K = (G; C = fCg) is in onsistent, thus nothing an be dedu ed from it, in luding Q. The KB has to be repaired rst.\nCombining rules and onstraints Let us ombine rules and onstraints in reasoning. We distinguish now between two kinds of rules: inferen e rules and evolution rules.\nInferen e rules represent impli it knowledge that is made expli it by rule appli ations. This is the ase for rules seen above (Figure 5). Fa ts and inferen e rules an be seen as des ribing a world, and applying a rule modi es the expli it des ription of the world (the fa ts). Now, if we onsider a KB omposed of a set of fa ts G, a set of inferen e rules R, and a set of onstraints C, the notion of onsisten y has to take rules into a ount. For instan e, add to the SGs G and H of Figure 6 the following information about o e assignments: [HeadOfgroup:L.℄->(in)->[Offi e:#1℄, [Se retary:H.℄->(in)->[Offi e:#2℄ and [Se retary:P.℄->(in)->[Offi e:#3℄. Let G 0 and H 0 be the (normal) SGs obtained. Consider the world omposed of the SG G 0 , inferen e rules fR\n1\n; R\n2\ng of Figure 5, and the\npositive onstraint C\n2\nof Figure 7. The SG G\n0\nalone does not satisfy the onstraint C2\n(be ause the head of group L. is in o e #1, and the se retary P. is in o e #3 , but it does not hold that #1 is near #3 ). But after a ertain number of rule appli ations, it does. Thus the KB is said to be onsistent. In this ase it is easy to de ne and he k\nonsisten y be ause the world des ription an be ompletely expli ited by a nite SG (the\ngraph H\n0\n, said to be full w.r.t. R), thus it su es to he k that this graph is onsistent.\nIn general ase, onsisten y relies on whether ea h onstraint violation an be repaired\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nby rule appli ations, as will be formally de ned later. As with simpler worlds des ribed by fa ts only, dedu tion is not possible on in onsistent knowledge bases.\nEvolution rules represent possible a tions leading from one world to another one. E.g. onsider the olored graph of Figure 8. As an inferen e rule, it would allow to dedu e that all persons are in all o es. As an evolution rule, it says that when there are a person and an o e, a possible a tion is to assign this o e to that person . Consider a KB omposed of a set of fa ts G, a set of evolution rules E , and a set of onstraints C. Fa ts des ribe an initial world; evolution rules represent possible transitions from one world to other worlds;\nonstraints de ne onsisten y of ea h world; a su essor of a onsistent world is obtained by an evolution rule appli ation; given a SG Q, the dedu tion problem asks whether there is a path of onsistent worlds evolving from the initial one to a world satisfying Q.\nThe most general model of the SG family onsiders both kinds of rules, i.e. a set R of inferen e rules, and a set E of evolution rules. In the parti ular ase of the Sysiphus-I modelization, G andR des ribe the initial information about o e lo ations, persons and the group organization. R also en odes general knowledge (su h as properties of the dif relation put between two on ept nodes representing distin t entities). C represents obligations and interdi tions de ning what a eptable assignments are (in luding ardinality onstraints su h as a person annot be in several o es or a large o e annot ontain more than two persons , using the dif relation). E onsists of one evolution rule whose result is to pla e a person into an o e (it ould also be omposed of several rules onsidering spe i pre onditions before trying an assignment). The goal represents a situation where ea h person of the group has an o e. A solution to the problem is a world obtained from the initial one by a sequen e of o e assignments, where ea h person has an o e, while satisfying the allo ation onstraints."

Or, more spe i ally:\nProperty 5 A SG G -violates a positive onstraint C i , onsidering C as a rule, the appli ation of C on G a ording to produ es a graph not equivalent to G.\nProof: Let C be a onstraint and G be a SG su h that G satis es C. If\n0\nis a proje tion\nfrom C\n(0)\ninto G, let us onsider the graph G\n0\nobtained by the appli ation of C ( onsidered\nnow as a rule) on G a ording to\n0\n. Let us now build the following proje tion\n0\nfrom G\n0\ninto G: for ea h node v,\n0\n(v) = v if v belongs to G; otherwise, v is a opy of a node w of\nC\n(1)\n, and if is one of the proje tions from C into G that extends\n0\n, we have\n0\n(v) = (w).\nThen\n0\nis a proje tion of G\n0\ninto G, and sin e G trivially proje ts into G\n0\n, they are thus\nequivalent.\nThis proves the ( part of property 5. For the ) part, we use the following property, proved by Cogis and Guinaldo (1995). In their property (prop. 6 of their paper) the SGs\nonsidered are onne ted graphs, but the proof holds for non onne ted graphs.\nProperty 6 (Cogis & Guinaldo, 1995) Let G be a SG and irr(G) be one of its equivalent irredundant subgraphs (if G is not redundant then irr(G) = G). Then there exists a folding from G to irr(G), i.e. a proje tion f from G into irr(G), su h that the restri tion of f to nodes of irr(G) is the identity (for every node x of irr(G), f(x) = x).\nSuppose now G -violates C. Sin e onstraint violation is de ned with respe t to the irredundant form of a graph, we an onsider, without loss of generality, that G is irredundant. We denote by G 0 the graph obtained by the appli ation of C (again, onsidered now as a rule) on G a ording to . We prove that G 0 equivalent to G leads to a ontradi tion.\nIf G\n0\nis equivalent to G, then there exists a proje tion from G\n0\ninto G. And sin e G is an\nirredundant subgraph of G\n0\n, there exists a folding f from G\n0\ninto G (property 6). Consider\nnow\n0\nthe proje tion from C to G de ned as follows: for any node x of C\n(0)\n,\n0\n(x) =\nf( (x)), otherwise let x\n0\nbe the opy of x in G\n0\n, we have\n0\n(x) = f(x\n0\n). Sin e for all x in\nC\n(0)\n, f( (x)) = (x),\n0\nextends . This ontradi ts the hypothesis G -violates C . Thus\nG\n0\nis not equivalent to G. 2\nProperty 7 If a SG G satis es a positive onstraint C, then any graph in a fCg-derivation of G is equivalent to G.\nProof: Let G = G\n0\n; :::; G\nk\nbe a fCg-derivation of G. From property 5, ea h G\ni\n, 1 i k,\nis equivalent to G\ni 1\n, thus by transitivity, is equivalent to G. 2\nUsing soundness and ompleteness of the SR dedu tion, and properties 5 and 7, one\nobtains the following relation with FOL dedu tion.\nTheorem 7 A SG G violates a positive onstraint C i there exists a SG G\n0\nsu h that\n(S); (G); (C) (G\n0\n) and not (S); (G) (G\n0\n), where (C) is the translation of C\nonsidered as a rule.\nBaget & Mugnier\nThis theorem an be reformulated in terms of abdu tive inferen e (using in fa t indire t abdu tion, see, for example, Konolige, 1996). Indeed, given a ba kground theory\n= (S); (G) and an observation O = : (C), G violates C i there is an abdu tive\nexplanation for O of the form :F , where F is a formula belonging to FOL(^;9)."

Moreover, the origin and destination must be proje ted into disjoint paths (i.e. a node of the origin annot have the same image has a node of the destination). If we restri t ourselves in some way to good appli ations of rules of E( ), then we an verify that G(m 0 ) (G(m);U( )) i G(m 0 ) (G(m);R( ) [ E( )).\nThis restri tion is obtained by using onstraints, that will allow every good appli ation\nof a rule of E( ), and be violated by the obtained graph otherwise.

      "text" : "Let us now fo us on the rules that were used to solve the Sisyphus-I problem. A bi olored graph (rule or onstraint) is said to be range restri ted (r.r.) if its se ond part ( on lusion or obligation) does not omprise any generi on ept node. We use this expression by analogy\nBaget & Mugnier\nPSfrag repla ements\nwith the so- alled rules in Datalog, where all variables of the head must appear in the body (Abiteboul et al., 1995). Su h rules are also alled safe in the literature. Consider for instan e the rules of Fig. 5: R\n1\nand R\n2\nare range restri ted, while R\n3\nis not.\nAlso noti e that a range restri ted rule R an be de omposed into an equivalent set of rules D(R) with exa tly one node in on lusion (either an individual on ept node or a relation node). There is one rule for ea h node of the on lusion of R: for ea h individual node , one rule with same hypothesis as R and a on lusion restri ted to ; for ea h relation node r, one rule whose hypothesis is the disjoint union of the hypothesis of R and of all individual on ept nodes of the on lusion of R, and on lusion is r, with same neighbors as in R. The logi al interpretation of su h rules are (fun tion free) range restri ted Horn rules. If a SG Q is dedu ible from a set of r.r. rules R, then it is dedu ible from the set of their de ompositions D(R), and re ipro ally. However, as soon as onstraints are involved, this equivalen e does not hold any more.\nProperty 11 A set of range restri ted rules is a nite expansion set.\nProof: Sin e all graphs are put into normal form, an individual marker appears at most on e in a graph. The number of individual nodes reated by the set of rules is bounded by M = jRj max\nR2R\njR\n(1)\nj. So the number of relation nodes reated (no twin relation\nnodes are reated) is bounded by N =\nP\nk n=1 P n (jV C (G)j +M) n , where P n is the number\nof relation types with a given arity n appearing in a rule on lusion, and k is the greatest arity of su h a relation type. So the losure of a graph an be obtained with a derivation of length L N +M . We thus obtain G R in nite time. 2\nNote that, ontrary to general nite expansion sets, existen e of the losure and existen e of the full graph are equivalent notions in the ase of range restri ted rules. It follows from the proof of property 11 that the length of a derivation from G to G R is in O(n k+1 ), where n is the size of (G;R) and k is the greatest arity of a relation type appearing in a rule on lusion. This rough upper bound ould be re ned but it is su ient to obtain the following property, whi h will be used throughout the proofs of omplexity results involving range restri ted rules.\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nProperty 12 Under the assumption that the maximum arity of relation types is a onstant, given a range restri ted set of rules R, the length of an R-derivation from G is polynomially related to the size of (G;R).\nIn what follows, we assume that the arity of relation types is bounded by a onstant.\nTheorem 12 (Complexity with range restri ted rules) When E and R are range restri ted rules:\nDedu tion in SR is NP- omplete.\nConsisten y and dedu tion in SRC are\nP 2 - omplete.\nDedu tion in SEC and SREC is\nP 3 - omplete.\nProof: The following results heavily rely on Prop. 12: all derivations involved being of polynomial length, they admit a polynomial erti ate (the sequen e of proje tions used to build the derivation).\nNP- ompleteness of SR-dedu tion. The problem belongs to NP. Indeed, a polynomial\nerti ate is given by a derivation from G to a graph G\n0\n, followed by a proje tion from\nthe goal to G\n0\n. When R = ;, one obtains SG-dedu tion (proje tion he king), thus the\nNP- ompleteness.\nP 2 - ompleteness of SRC- onsisten y and SRC-dedu tion. Re all the onsisten y\nhe k involves the irredundant form of G. In order to lighten the problem formulation, we assume here that all SGs are irredundant, but irredundan y an be integrated without in reasing the onsisten y he k omplexity: see the proof of theorem 8. SRC- onsisten y belongs to P\n2\nsin e it orresponds to the language L = fx j 8y\n1\n9y\n2\nR(x; y\n1\n; y\n2\n)g, where\nx en odes an instan e (G;R; C) of the problem and (x; y\n1\n; y\n2\n) 2 R i y\n1\n= (d\n1\n;\n0\n), where\nd\n1\nis a derivation from G to G\n0\n,\n0\nis a proje tion from the trigger of a onstraint C\ni(0)\ninto G\n0\n, y\n2\n= (d\n2\n;\n1\n), d\n2\nis a derivation from G\n0\nto G\n00\nand\n1\nis a proje tion from C\ni\ninto\nG\n00\ns.t.\n1\n[C\ni(0)\n℄ =\n0\n. R is polynomially de idable and polynomially balan ed (sin e the\nlengths of d\n1\nand d\n2\nare polynomial in the size of the input). When R = ;, one obtains the\nproblem SGC- onsisten y, thus the\nP 2 - ompleteness. Sin e SRC-dedu tion onsists in\nsolving two independent problems, SRC- onsisten y (\nP 2 - omplete) and SR-dedu tion\n(NP- omplete), and sin e NP is in luded in\nP 2 , SRC-dedu tion is also P 2 - omplete.\nP 3 - ompleteness of SEC-dedu tion. As for SRC (see above), we assume that all SGs\nare irredundant. The question is are there a derivation from G to a SG G\n0\nand a proje tion\nfrom Q into G\n0\n, su h that for all G\ni\nof this derivation, for all onstraint C\nj\n, for all proje tion\nfrom C\nj(0)\ninto G\ni\n, there exists a proje tion\n0\nfrom C\nj\ninto G\ni\ns.t.\n0\n[C\nj(0)\n℄ = ? . R\nis polynomially de idable and polynomially balan ed (sin e the size of the derivation from G to G 0 is polynomially related to the size of the input). Thus, SEC-dedu tion is in P\n3\n.\nIn order to prove the ompleteness, we build a redu tion from a spe ial ase of the problem B\n3\n, where the formula is a 3-CNF (i.e. an instan e of 3-SAT): given a formula E, whi h is a\nonjun tion of lauses with at most 3 literals, and a partition fX\n1\n;X\n2\n;X\n3\ng of its variables,\ndoes there exist a truth assignment for the variables in X\n1\n, su h that for all truth assignment\nfor the variables of X\n2\n, there exists a truth assignment for the variables of X\n3\nsu h that E is\ntrue?

By applying on e the evolution rule E, we try some valuation of the variables in X\n1\nand obtain a world G\n1\n, that ontains an answer to Q. But this world has to satisfy the\npositive onstraint C\n+\n, expressing that for every valuation of the variables in X\n1\n[X\n2\n, there\nmust exist a valuation of the variables in X\n3\nsu h that the formula evaluates to true . If\nG\n1\nsatis es this onstraint, it means that we have found (by applying E) a valuation of the\nvariables in X\n1\nsu h that for all valuations of variables in X\n1\n[X\n2\n(whi h an be simpli ed\nin for all valuations of variables in X\n2\n, sin e there is only one su h valuation for X\n1\n), there\nis a valuation of the variables in X\n3\nsu h that the formula evaluates to true. Then there\nis an answer yes to the 3-SAT\n3\nproblem. Conversely, suppose an answer no to the SEC\nproblem. It means that for every world G\n1\nthat an be obtained by applying the rule E, the\nonstraint C\n+\nis violated (otherwise Q ould be proje ted into G\n1\nand the answer would be\nyes). Thus there is no assignment of the variables in X\n1\nsatisfying the onstraint, i.e. the\nanswer to the 3-SAT\n3\nproblem is no.\nP 3 - ompleteness of SREC-dedu tion. SREC-dedu tion stays in the same lass of\nomplexity as SEC-dedu tion. Indeed, the question is are there an RE-derivation from G\nto G\n0\nand a proje tion from Q to a SG G\n0\n, su h that for all G\ni\nof this derivation either equal\nto G or obtained by an immediate E-derivation, for all G\n0 i of this derivation derived from G i\nby an R-derivation, for all onstraint C\nj\n, for all proje tion from C\nj(0)\nto G\n0 i , there exists\nan R-derivation from G\n0 i to a SG G 00 i and a proje tion 0 from C j to G 00 i s.t. 0 [C j(0) ℄ = ?\nand the lengths of all derivations are polynomial in the size of the input.

Papadimitriou, 1994), thus the DP- ompleteness.\nSemi-de idability of SRC-in onsisten y: To prove the in onsisten y of a KB, we must nd some violation of a onstraint that will never be restored. But no violation of a negative onstraint an ever be restored (further rule appli ations an only add information, thus more possible proje tions, and annot remove the ulprit one). So we only have to prove that one\nonstraint of C an be dedu ed from (G;R): it is a semi-de idable problem. Unde idability of SRC-dedu tion follows: we must prove that Q an be dedu ed from (G;R), but that no onstraint of C an.\nThe arguments proving semi-de idability of dedu tion in SEC and unde idability of\ndedu tion in SREC are the same as the ones used in the proof of Th. 10. 2\nThe restri tion to negative onstraints de reases omplexity of problems in the SGC model, but it does not help mu h as soon as rules are involved, sin e these problems remain unde idable.

In onsisten y is thus in NP, and ompleteness follows from the parti ular ase when R is empty. For dedu tion, we must prove that no onstraint an be dedu ed from (G;R), but that Q an. So the problem is in DP. For ompleteness, remark that the problem is still omplete when R is empty (Th. 13).\nTo prove that SEC-dedu tion with r.r. rules and negative onstraints is\nP 2 - omplete,\nwe will rst show that it belongs to\nP 2 , then exhibit a redu tion from a P 2 - omplete\nproblem to its o-problem SEC-non-dedu tion (sin e o-\nP i = P i ).\nSEC-dedu tion orresponds to the language L = fx j 9y\n1\n8y\n2\nR(x; y\n1\n; y\n2\n)g, where x\nen odes an instan e (Q; (G; E ; C)) of the problem, and (x; y\n1\n; y\n2\n) 2 R if y\n1\nen odes an E-\nderivation from G to G\n0\nand a proje tion from Q to G\n0\n, and y\n2\nen odes a mapping from\nsome onstraint of C to G\n0\nthat is not a proje tion (note that if G\n0\ndoes not violate any\nonstraint, then no graph in the derivation from G to G\n0\ndoes).\nWe exhibit now a redu tion from the general SGC- onsisten y problem to SECnon-dedu tion with r.r. rules and negative onstraints. Let (G; C = fCg) be an instan e of SGC- onsisten y (w.l.o.g., we restri t the problem to onsider only one positive\nonstraint). The transformation we onsider builds an instan e of SEC-non-dedu tion\n(Q(C); (G; E(C); C (C))) as follows. We all the frontier of the positive onstraint C the set of nodes in the trigger (i.e. olored by 0) having at least one neighbor in the obligation. The de nition of olored graphs implies that frontier nodes are on ept nodes (their neighbors are thus relation nodes). Let us denote these frontier nodes by 1; : : : ; k. The evolution rule E(C) has for hypothesis the trigger of C, and for on lusion a relation node typed found, where found is a new k-ary relation type in omparable with all other types. The i th neighbor of this node is the on ept node i. Che k that E(C) is a range restri ted rule. The negative onstraint C (C) is the subgraph of C omposed of its obligation (C\n(1)\n)\nadded with nodes of the frontier and the relation node typed found, linked to the frontier nodes in the same way as above. Finally, the SG Q(C) is made of one relation node typed found and its neighbors frontier nodes. This transformation is illustrated in Fig. 18.\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nW.l.o.g. we an assume that G is irredundant: in that ase, SGC- onsisten y is still\nP 2 - omplete (see that the transformation used in the proof of Th. 8 produ es an irredundant graph G). Now suppose that (G; C) is onsistent: it means that either the trigger of C does not proje t into G, and in that ase, the rule E(C) will never produ e the needed (found) node, or every (existing) proje tion of the ondition of C into G = irr(G) an be extended to a proje tion of C as a whole. So every appli ation of E(C) produ es a violation of C (C). In both ases Q(C) annot be dedu ed from the knowledge base. Conversely, suppose that G -violates C, then the appli ation of E(C) following produ es a graph that does not violate C (C), and we an dedu e Q(C). 2\nThe above theorem shows a de rease in omplexity when general positive onstraints\nare restri ted to negative ones. SGC- onsisten y falls from\nP 2 to o-NP and, when\nalso onsidering range restri ted rules, SRC- onsisten y falls from\nP 2 to DP, and SEC-\ndedu tion falls from\nP 3 to P 2 . It would be interesting to exhibit parti ular ases of\nonstraints, more general than negative ones, that make this omplexity fall into interme-\ndiary lasses (by example DP and\nP 2 for SGC- onsisten y). Some synta ti restri tions\nwe de ned for rules are good andidates: though a nite expansion set of onstraints has no sense, let us onsider range restri ted onstraints. Let us also de ne dis onne ted onstraints as onstraints where the trigger and the obligation are not onne ted; su h onstraints in-\nlude the topologi al onstraints used in (Mineau & Missaoui, 1997).\nThe following property highlights the relationships of these parti ular ases with negative\nonstraints:\nProperty 13 Negative onstraints are a parti ular ase of both range-restri ted onstraints and dis onne ted onstraints.\nProof: As noti ed in se tion 5, a negative onstraint is equivalent to a positive onstraint whose obligation is omposed of one on ept node of type NotThere, where NotThere is in omparable with all other types and does not appear in any SG ex ept in C (it is thus a dis onne ted onstraint). W.l.o.g. this node an be labeled by an individual marker (whi h, as NotThere, appears only in C), thus leading to a onstraint whi h is both dis onne ted and range-restri ted. 2\nTheorem 15 (Complexity with dis onne ted onstraints) When C ontains only dis-\nonne ted onstraints:\nSGC- onsisten y be omes o-DP- omplete.\nSRC- onsisten y and SRC-dedu tion remain unde idable, but SRC- onsisten y be omes o-DP- omplete when rules are range-restri ted.\nSEC-dedu tion remains semi-de idable, but be omes\nP 2 - omplete when rules are\nrange-restri ted.\nSREC-dedu tion remains unde idable, but be omes\nP 2 - omplete when rules are\nrange-restri ted.\nBaget & Mugnier\nProof: SGC-in onsisten y belongs to DP, sin e we must prove that for one onstraint there is a proje tion of its trigger and no proje tion of its obligation. Completeness is proved with a redu tion from SAT/UNSAT (as in proof of Th. 13). SGC- onsisten y is thus o-DP- omplete.\nArguments for unde idability of SRC- onsisten y, SRC-dedu tion and SREC-dedu tion, as well as semi-de idability of SEC-dedu tion, are the same as in the proof of Th. 10: the onstraints we used were already dis onne ted.\nWhen rules are range-restri ted, SRC-in onsisten y belongs to DP: we must prove that the trigger of the onstraint an be dedu ed from (G;R), but not its obligation, and these problems belong respe tively to NP and o-NP. Completeness omes from the parti - ular ase where R is empty. SRC- onsisten y is thus o-DP- omplete.\nSEC-dedu tion belongs to\nP 2 when rules involved are range-restri ted. Though this\nproperty does not appear with an immediate formulation of the problem, it be omes obvious when the problem is stated as follows: does there exist a sequen e of graphs G = G\n0\n; : : : ; G\np\n; G\np+1\n, where G = G\n0\n; : : : ; G\np\nis an E-derivation and G\np+1\nis the disjoint\nunion of G\np\nand C\n(1)\n, a proje tion from Q to G\np\nand a proje tion from C\n(1)\nto a SG G\nk\n,\n0 k p + 1 su h that for every graph G\ni\n; 0 i < k,( ) for every mapping of C\n(0)\ninto G\ni\n, is not a proje tion ? . Noti e that no G\ni\nbefore G\nk\nin su h a sequen e triggers\nthe onstraint (C\n(0)\ndoes not proje t into G\ni\n) and that all G\ni\n, i k, satisfy it (sin e C\n(1)\nproje ts to G\ni\n), thus all G\ni\nof the sequen e are onsistent. G\np+1\nensures that C\n(1)\nproje ts\ninto at least one graph of the sequen e, whi h allows the above formulation of the problem. Completeness follows from the parti ular ase of negative onstraints.\nProof for SREC-dedu tion in the ase of range restri ted rules is similar: in the ex-\npression of the problem above, the derivation is now an (E[R)-derivation, the G\ni\nonsidered\nare only the ones obtained after the appli ation of a rule from E , and ( ) for every mapping\nof C\n(0)\ninto G\ni\nis repla ed by for every graph that an be R-derived from G\ni\n. 2\nUnfortunately, range-restri ted onstraints are tri kier to study: intuitively, onsisten y he king should be ome easier than with general onstraints, but the role of irredundan y is still un lear. Though it is easy to he k that SGC-dedu tion with range restri ted\nonstraints is at least DP-hard (transformation from SAT/UNSAT) and we have proven\n(though it is not in luded in this paper) that it is in\nP 2 (i.e. P NP ), we did not manage to\na hieve an exa t omplexity result for this problem.\nWe did not either manage to assign a omplexity lass for the SGC\nd\n-dedu tion and\nSR\nrr\nC\nd\n-dedu tion problems, though both problems trivially belong to\n2\nP.\nComplexity results obtained in this paper are summarized in table. 1. We also present in Fig. 19 a omplexity map emphasizing the relationships between problems. In this gure, if E denotes a set of bi olored graphs (rules or onstraints), E fes , E rr , E d respe tively denote its restri tion to a nite expansion set, range restri ted elements, or dis onne ted elements. C denotes a set of negative onstraints. All problems represented are omplete for their lass. Edges are dire ted from bottom to top. An edge from a problem P1 to a problem P2 means that P1 is a parti ular ase of P2. Moreover, in order that the map remains readable, problems whi h are intermediate between two problems P1 and P2 of the same omplexity lass, do not appear in the gure. The omplexity of su h problems an be obtained by lassifying them in the hierar hy.

      "text" : "One interesting relationship from an algorithmi viewpoint is with the CSP framework. Re-\nall the input of a onstraint satisfa tion problem (CSP) is a onstraint network, omposed of a set of variables, sets of possible values for the variables ( alled their domains) and a set of onstraints between the variables. The question is whether there is a solution to the CSP, i.e. an assignment of values to the variables that satis es the onstraints.\nThe onstraints involved in a lassi al CSP are simpler than ours. A tually, CSP or-\nresponds to the SG-dedu tion (proje tion) problem.\nSeveral authors noti ed the strong equivalen e between CSP and labelled graph homomorphism (Given two labeled graphs G and H, is there a homomorphism from G to H?). As far as we know, the rst paper on this subje t was (Feder & Vardi, 1993). In (Mugnier, 2000) orresponden es are detailed from Proje tion (Given two SGs G and H is there a proje tion from G to H ?) to CSP, and re ipro ally (developing the ones presented in (Mugnier & Chein, 1996)). Let us outline the ideas of the transformation from CSP to Proje tion, alled C2P . Consider a onstraint network P . P is transformed into two SGs G and H as follows. G translates the stru ture of P : ea h on ept node is generi and orresponds to a variable and ea h relation node orresponds to a onstraint (its ith neighbor is the on ept node orresponding to the ith variable of the onstraint). H represents the onstraint de nitions: there is one individual on ept node for ea h value of a variable domain, and one relation node for ea h tuple of ompatible values. Roughly said, there is a solution to P if there is a mapping from variables ( on ept nodes of G) to values ( on ept nodes of H) that satis es the onstraints (maps relation nodes of G onto relation nodes of H), i.e. a proje tion from G to H. The same result has been a hieved independently in the Attributed Graph Grammar formalism by Rudolf (1998).\nOne ould also see CSP as a parti ular ase of SGC- onsisten y: indeed, there is a proje tion from a SG G into a SG H if and only if H satis es the positive onstraint with an empty trigger and G as its obligation.\nBaget & Mugnier\nPSfrag repla ements\nPolynomial hierar hy\nTruly Unde idable\nSemi-De idable o-Semi-De idable\nDe idable\n3\nP\n3\nP\n3\nP\n2\nP\n2\nP\n2\nP\nDP o-DP\no-NP NP\nP\nSREC-dedu tion\nSRC- onsisten y\nSRC -dedu tion\nSRC - onsisten y\nSRC\nrr\n- onsisten y\nSR\nfes\nEC-dedu tion\nS(RE)\nfes\nC-dedu tion\nSR\nd\nE\nrr\nC\nrr\n-dedu tion\nSR\nfes\n-dedu tion\nSR-dedu tion\nSR\nrr\nE\nrr\nC-dedu tion\nSR\nrr\nC-dedu tion\nSGC- onsisten y\nSGC-dedu tion\nSGC\nd\n- onsisten y\nSGC\nd\n-dedu tion\nSE\nrr\nC\nd\n-dedu tion\nSE\nrr\nC-dedu tion\nSR\nrr\n-dedu tion\nSG-dedu tion\nSG\nT\n-dedu tion\nSR\nrr\nE\nrr\nC\nd\n-dedu tion\nSE\nrr\nC -dedu tion\nSGC - onsisten y\nSR\nrr\nC - onsisten y\nSR\nfes\nC - onsisten y\nSR\nrr\nC\nd\n-dedu tion\nSR\nrr\nC\nd\n- onsisten y\nSR\nrr\nC -dedu tion\nSGC -dedu tion\nFigure 19: Complexity Results: a Geography\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nNow, in order to deal with in omplete knowledge Fargier et al. (1996)\n1\nextend the\nCSP framework to mixed-CSP. In a mixed-CSP the set of variables is de omposed into\nontrollable and un ontrollable variables, say X and . The MIXED-SAT problem asks whether a binary mixed-CSP is onsistent, whi h an be reformulated as follows: is it true that every solution to the subnetwork indu ed by an be extended to a solution of the whole network? MIXED-SAT is shown to be P\n2\n- omplete. This result provides us another\nproof of\nP 2 - ompleteness for SGC- onsisten y. Indeed, any mixed-CSP an be translated\ninto an instan e of SGC- onsisten y. Using the C2P redu tion des ribed above, the mixed-CSP is mapped to SGs G and H. G is then provided with two olors, giving a positive onstraint C, whose trigger is the subgraph orresponding to the subnetwork indu ed by . The mixed-CSP is onsistent if and only if H satis es C. Fig. 20 illustrates this transformation. The onstraint network is omposed of the two variable sets X = fx\n1\n; x\n2\ng\nand = fl\n1\n; l\n2\ng and three onstraints C\n1\n, C\n2\nand C\n3\n. x\n1\nand x\n2\nhave same domain\nf1; 2; 3g and l\n1\nand l\n2\nhave same domain fa; bg. The onstraint de nitions are given in\nthe gure. All on ept types are supposed to be in omparable.\nPSfrag repla ements\nC\nC\nC\nLet us relate our de nitions to other de nitions of onstraints found in the CG literature. Our onstraints (let us all them SG- onstraints) are a parti ular ase of the minimal des riptive onstraints de ned in (Dibie et al., 1998): a minimal des riptive onstraint an be seen as a set of SG- onstraints with the same trigger; its intuitive semanti s is if A holds so must B\n1\nor B\n2\nor ... B\nk\n. A SG satis es a minimal des riptive onstraint if it satis es at\nleast one element of the set. Note that the disjun tion does not in rease the omplexity of the onsisten y he k relative to SG- onstraints. The proof of theorem 8 ( omplexity of SGC - onsisten y) an be used to show that onsisten y of minimal des riptive onstraints is also P\n2\n- omplete. Dibie et al. (1998) have pointed out that minimal des riptive onstraints\ngeneralize most onstraints found in the CG literature. A tually, these latter onstraints are also parti ular ases of SG- onstraints (for instan e, as already noti ed, the topologi al\nonstraints used by Mineau & Missaoui, 1997 are dis onne ted SG- onstraints). Let us add that, in these CG works, onstraints are used to he k onsisten y of SGs solely and not\n1. We thank Christian Bessière for this referen e.\nBaget & Mugnier\nof ri her knowledge bases omposed of rules (as in SRC) and they are not integrated into more omplex reasonings (as in SEC or in SREC).\nThere should be other onne tions with works about veri ation of knowledge bases omposed of logi al rules (for instan e Horn rules), namely with the works of Levy and Rousset (1996), in whi h onstraints are TGDs, thus have the same form than ours, but we did not nd dire t relationships between their framework and ours.\nAs both models are rooted in semanti networks, omparing on eptual graphs and des riptions logi s is a problem that has often been issued. Baader, Molitor, and Tobies (1999) have identi ed a fragment of the SG model (where simple graphs are restri ted to those having a tree-like stru ture, but onjun tive types are allowed) with a language alled ELIRO 1 : this equivalen e has led to a new tra tability result in des ription logi s. However, trying to identify larger fragments seems to be a dead-end: as pointed out by Mugnier (2000), proje tion annot handle negation on primitive types. On the other hand, even the most expressive des ription logi s annot express the whole FOL(^;9) fragment (Borgida, 1996). En oding some existing des ription logi s into models of the SG family is an interesting perspe tive, that ould allow one to identify new de idable lasses for our models, add type expressiveness to on eptual graphs, and may be y les in the des ription of DLs on epts."

      "text" : "We have proposed a family of models that an be seen as the basis of a generi modeling framework. Main features of this framework are the following: a lear distin tion between di erent kinds of knowledge, that t well with intuitive ategories, a uniform graph-based language that keeps essential properties of the SG model, namely readability of obje ts as well as reasonings. We guess this latter point is parti ularly important for the usability of any knowledge based system. In our framework, all kinds of knowledge are graphs easily interpreted, and reasonings an be graphi ally represented in a natural manner using the graphs themselves, thus explained to the user on its own modelization.\nTe hni al ontributions, w.r.t. previous works on on eptual graphs, an be summarized\nas follows:\nthe representation of di erent kinds of knowledge as olored SGs: fa ts, inferen e rules, evolution rules and onstraints.\nthe integration of onstraints into a reasoning model; more or less similar notions of a\nonstraint had already been introdu ed but were only used to he k onsisten y of a simple graph (as in the SGC model). The omplexity of onsisten y he king was not known.\na systemati study of the obtained family of models with a omplexity lassi ation of asso iated onsisten y/dedu tion problems, in luding the study of parti ular ases of rules and onstraints, whi h provide interesting omplexity results.\nWe also established links between onsisten y he king and FOL dedu tion, translating the onsisten y/dedu tion problems in terms of FOL dedu tion. It should be noti ed that the operational semanti s of models ombining rules and onstraints, namely SREC, SRC and SEC, is easy to understand but we were not able to give a global logi al semanti s. Indeed,\nThe Complexity of Rules and Constraints\nthere is an underlying non monotoni me hanism whose logi al interpretation should require non standard logi s. The de nition of a logi al semanti s for these models is thus an open problem."

Reasoning in this model an be expressed by a graph homomorphism alled proje tion, whose semanti s is usually given in terms of positive, onjun tive, existential FOL. We present here a family of extensions of this model, based on rules and onstraints, keeping graph homomorphism as the basi operation. We fo us on the formal de nitions of the di erent models obtained, in luding their operational semanti s and relationships with FOL, and we analyze the de idability and omplexity of the asso iated problems ( onsisten y and dedu tion). As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, these problems are not de idable, but we exhibit a ondition under whi h they fall in the polynomial hierar hy.
