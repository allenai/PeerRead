      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular those based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [1], powerfully model varying-length sequential data, achieving state-of-the-art results for problems spanning natural language processing, image captioning, handwriting recognition, and genomic analysis [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. LSTM RNNs can capture long range dependencies and nonlinear dynamics. Clinical time series data, as recorded in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), exhibit these properties and others, including irregular sampling and non-random missing values [11]. Symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome, for example, often do not appear for 24- 48 hours after lung injury [12]. Other approaches like Markov models, conditional random fields, and Kalman filters deal with sequential data, but are ill-equipped to learn long-range dependencies. Some models require domain knowledge or feature engineering, offering less chance for serendipitous discovery. Neural networks learn representations, potentially discovering unforeseen structure.\nThis paper presents a preliminary empirical study of LSTM RNNs applied to supervised phenotyping of multivariate PICU time series. We classify each episode as having one or more diagnoses from among over one hundred possibilities. Prior works have applied RNNs to health data, including electrocardiograms [13, 14, 15] and glucose measurements [16]. RNNs have also been used for prediction problems in genomics [8, 10, 9]. A variety of works have applied feed-forward neural networks to health data for prediction and pattern mining, but none have used RNNs or directly handled variable length sequences [17, 18, 19, 20]. To our knowledge, this work is the first to apply modern LSTMs to a large data set of multivariate clinical time series. Our experiments show that LSTMs can successfully classify clinical time series from raw measurements, naturally handling challenges like variable sequence length and high dimensional output spaces."

      "heading" : "2 Data Description",
      "text" : "Our experiments use a collection of fully anonymized clinical time series extracted from the electronic health records system at Children’s Hospital LA [11, 20] as a part of an IRB-approved study. The data consist of 10, 401 PICU episodes, each a multivariate time series of 13 variables including vital signs, lab results, and subjective assessments. The episodes vary in length from 12 hours to 30 days. Each episode has zero or more diagnostic labels from an in-house taxonomy, similar to ICD-9 codes, used for research and billing. There are 128 distinct labels indicating a variety of conditions, such as acute respiratory distress, congestive heart failure, seizures, renal failure, and sepsis.\nar X\niv :1\n51 0.\n07 64\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n6 O\nct 2\nThe original data are irregularly sampled multivariate time series with missing values and occasionally missing variables. We resample all time series to an hourly rate (similar to [11]), taking the mean measurement within each one hour window and filling gaps by propagating measurements forward or backward. When time series are missing entirely, we impute a clinically normal value.1 We rescale variables to a [0, 1] interval using ranges defined by clinical experts."

      "heading" : "3 Methods and Experiments",
      "text" : "We cast the problem of phenotyping clinical time series as multilabel classification, and our proposed LSTM RNN uses memory cells with forget gates as described in [21] but without peephole connections as described in [22]. As output, we use a fully connected layer atop the highest LSTM layer, with a sigmoid activation function because the problem is multilabel. Binary cross-entropy is the loss at each output node. Among architectures that we tested, the simplest and most effective passes over the data in chronological order, outputting predictions only at the final sequence step.\nWe train the network using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Absent momentum, the variance of the gradient is large, and single examples occasionally destroy the model. Interestingly, the presence of exploding gradients had no apparent connection to the loss on the particular example that caused it. To combat exploding gradients, we experimented with `22 weight decay, gradient clipping, and truncated backpropagation. We test various settings for the number of layers and nodes, choosing the best using validation performance.\nWe evaluate the LSTM-based models against a variety of baselines. All models are trained on 80% of the data and tested on 10%. The remaining 10% is used for hyper-parameter optimization, e.g., regularization strength and early stopping. We report micro- and macro-averaged area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) and F1 score. We also report precision at 10, which captures the fraction of true diagnoses among the model’s top 10 predictions, with a best possible score of 0.2818 on these data. We provide results for a base rate model that predicts diagnoses in descending order by incidence to provide a minimum performance baseline. Logistic regression with `22 regularization and carefully engineered features encoding domain knowledge formed a strong baseline. Nonetheless, an LSTM with two layers of 128 hidden units achieved the best overall performance on all metrics but precision at 10, while using only raw time series as input.\nOverall classification performance for 128 PICU phenotypes Model Micro AUC Macro AUC Micro F1 Macro F1 Precision at 10 Base rate 0.7170 0.5 0.1366 0.0339 0.0753 Linear, last 12 hours raw data 0.8041 0.7286 0.2263 0.1004 0.0986 Linear, engineered features 0.8277 0.7628 0.2498 0.1254 0.1085 LSTM, 2 layers, 128 nodes each 0.8324 0.7717 0.2577 0.1304 0.1078"

      "heading" : "4 Discussion",
      "text" : "Our results indicate that LSTM RNNs can be successfully applied to the problem of phenotyping critical care patients given clinical time series data. Promising early experiments with gradient normalization suggest that we can improve our results further. Our next steps to advance this research include advanced optimization and regularization strategies, techniques to directly handle missing values and irregular sampling, and extending this work to a larger PICU data set with a richer set of measurements, including treatments and medications. Additionally, there remain many questions about the interpretability of neural networks when applied to complex medical problems. We are developing methods to expose the patterns of health and illness learned by LSTMs to clinical users and to make practical use of the distributed representations learned by LSTMs in applications like patient similarity search.\n1Many variables are recorded at rates proportional to how quickly they change, and when a variable is entirely absent, it is often because clinical staff believed it to be normal and chose not to measure it."
