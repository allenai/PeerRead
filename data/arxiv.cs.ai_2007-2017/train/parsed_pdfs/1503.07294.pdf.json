      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "There are various ways human could express their feelings and emotions: speech, text, gesture, facial expression and so on. Due to the advance in Internet technology, they write reviews at online websites such as Amazon and CNet after they used certain products and services. Thus, Internet becomes a medium in communicating with other people of similar interest. Reviews give huge impacts on\nbusiness and social field. For business, a business company able to know how end users feel for their products from social perspective: the reviews actually can influence other people’s decisions and opinions regarding certain product.\nThe Quality in Use (QU) model by International Standard Organization (ISO) is the validated measured method to measure the quality of software or products which related to the outcome after user interacted with the products [2]. The indicators for QU model are effectiveness, efficiency and freedom from risk, satisfaction and context coverage [2]. According to Atoum and Bong, the reason that drives users to use a product is if the product is perceived able to achieve particular goals such as effectiveness and efficiency [1]. In this study, we intend to automatically reveal the indicators from a pool of software reviews without human intervention. These indicators are important as they are the key decision factors to be taken into a consideration before a company purchase and adopt particular software.\nAs the Internet and social media thrive, the vigorous rate of increasing number of user generated reviews or related text have made the analyzing task become tedious and difficult. In addition to the incongruent context such as emotion and personal preference, the process is further complicated with the different interpretation of ambiguous word expressed by different individuals.\nIn this paper, we investigate a computational way to help in assimilating the mountainous reviews into useful information to allow one to\nmake decision. We get QU indicators’ related behavioral variables and use their respective measurement scales to indicate the existence of QU indicators in reviews. We assume that when we able to relate similar measurement items to the reviews, we can infer their QU indicators."

      "text" : "Users write reviews to express their feelings and communicate with others after they used a certain product. Most of the text mining methods on user reviews are based on feature to determine the polarity (positive, neutral or negative). There are other information that can be revealed from the reviews such as the QU indicators, which determined if ICT products able to help to achieve an organization’s goals. Furthermore, interpreting reviews by human can cause bias and confusion as each of us have our own distinct interpretations. Thus, interpreting reviews sometime are subjectively depended on individual context. With this, we desire an approach to detect QU indicator from reviews without introducing bias."

      "heading" : "4 BACKGROUND",
      "text" : "Personal satisfaction, success of business and human safety are depended on high quality software and system [2]. It is important that product quality characteristics can be measured based on validated measurement methods according to International Standard derived from ISO/IEC 9126:1991. This international standard defines a QU model that composed of five characteristics that about “the outcome of interaction when a product is used in a\nparticular context of use” [2]. QU model is a model that represent “the degree to which a product or system can be used by specific users to meet their needs to achieve specific goals” [2]. Examples of the goals are effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction.\nFor the sake of brevity, in this study, we are focusing on three characteristics: effectiveness, efficiency and freedom from risk as QU indicators. The definitions for the three chosen QU indicators according to ISO 9241-11 [2] are given in Table 1.\nAs the formal definition of the three QU indicators from ISO document is rather brief, we reinforced the indicators with expert validated measurement scales from Human Behavioral Project [4]. The examples of the measuring scales for each indicator are shown in Table 2."

      "heading" : "5.1 Latent Semantic Analysis Universal Space and Subspace",
      "text" : "Latent semantic analysis (LSA) uses vector space model (VSM) to represent documents and words as vectors in a high dimensional vector space. The model defines the documents based on the sum of the words (or known as type) meanings. Therefore this can be used to find similar documents based on semantic meaning which does not necessitate that two similar documents must have the same words to define them as similar.\nAs explained by Martin and Berry [5], to create the vector space model, we form typeby-document matrix A from the documents. The rows of the matrix represent terms and column represents each document. The\nelements of matrix A, are the frequencies of the particular terms ( appear in each document ( .\nWeighting functions such as log entropy, term frequency-inverse document frequency\n(TFIDF) usually used to normalize the documents. The purpose is to give higher weights to the terms that appear in several documents but not all and give lower weights to the terms that frequently appear in many documents which are not significant. Once we created matrix A, we convert them into orthogonal components. Orthogonal matrix contain [5]:\nQ= I\nLSA used Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) to convert matrix A into orthogonal components. SVD can represent types and documents simultaneously that able to capture the underlying semantic meaning by manipulating the number of dimensions [5]. SVD for m x n matrix A is shown as below\n∑\nType vectors and document vectors are representing words and documents coordinates respectively in the semantic space. By choosing the number of dimensions, we can find significant words and documents representations which capture the main information. In order to create k-dimensional semantic space, the SVD truncated and created\nwhich reduce the dimension from r to k [5]. In this way, noises are removed and it captures the important semantic structure of types of documents [5]. Types or documents that contain similar meaning are located close to each other in this k-dimensional space. Once the vector space is created, we can project query: words or documents, find similar types or documents in this high dimensional space.\nOrthogonal matrix\nType vectors\nDocument vectors\nDiagonal matrix/ singular values\nIdentity matrix Transpose of Q\n(5.2 )\n(5.1)\n(5.2)\nWe treat query as document to be projected in the space which also known as “pseudodocument” [5], hereby it can be represented by,\nWhere vector is the weighted frequency of the types based on the types in query. The weights given are using weighting function. In our experiment, we build the k-dimensional semantic space (universal semantic space) using the set of paragraphs extracted from high quality journal. According to the findings presented by Martin and Berry [5], the best optimal choice for number of dimension, K is between 100 and 300. Hereby we have chosen K=300 in our experiments. Besides that, due to we are going to test on reviews, thus we also used set of Amazon reviews to build the space. We intend to build a universal semantic space that contains contexts related to both measurement scales and reviews. After we formed the semantic space, we projected our measurement scales into the space by sentences basic. We treat the measurement scales as “pseudo-document” because we want to get their positions in the semantic space.\nMeasurement scales act as the contexts for each QU indicators. After we have projected all measurement scales into the semantic space, we had created a new subspace known as “scale subspace”. This newly built subspace contains vectors of measurement scales. We then projected our reviews as second ‘pseudodocument” into the universal space yielding reviews vectors,\nTo combine both,\nWe can see that both reviews and measurement scales are now positioned in the same universal space. They have common weighted sum of type vectors ( scaled by the common singular values which derived from the universal space (shown by in formula 5.6). We can see that both items and reviews are utilized the universal semantic space that are rich with various words usage which can bring them closer to each other based on their words meaning in a reduced dimensionality space. We use cosine similarity measure to find similar measurement scales to our testing reviews based on their vectors in the newly built “items subspace” instead of the large universal semantic space. Which means the universal semantic space are act as the platform to improve the semantic similarity between the measurement scales and reviews. To summarize, we assume that when we build universal semantic space with huge amount of related documents, it can sufficiently define different “concepts”. Then the subspace is built based on our interest topics or concepts which related to the universal semantic space context."

The gold standard is a set of software review sentences crawled from the web and classified by the annotators. These sentences (at the end of the annotation process) will have the sentence quality-in-use topic, sentence polarity and indicating topic keyword(s). First, a set of reviews are crawled from software web sites Amazon.com and CNet.com respectively. These reviews are filtered. Then the top 10% reviews from each review rating are selected. Next, reviews are split into sentences. Finally, the sentences are given to annotators for tagging and annotation.\nBefore we run the experiments, we labelled each of the measurement scales and annotated reviews with the three QU indicators: efficiency, effectiveness, freedom from risk."

We would like to investigate how the different universal semantic space can affect the overall performance. Next, for every universal semantic space built, we created a subspace by projecting measurement scales and testing reviews based on common term weights that have been scaled and truncated in the universal semantic space. By using this subspace, we can find similar measurement scales based on cosine similarity between the vectors presented in the subspace. We filter the returned results and get the final review’s predicted indicators. We repeat each step for every testing review and report the precision."

Based on our study, this is the best optimum number to achieve the best accuracy. Next, we undergo several filtering steps on the results that we obtained to decide the best QU indicators for the review. The overall views of the filtering steps are illustrated by the pseudo code below:\nFrom the returned list of measurement scales, sorted by their similarity score, we need to check the variance of the similarity score between them. If the variance exceeded 0.2, we opt for the QU indicators with the highest similarity score. If the variance is less than 0.2, we infer the most similar QU indicators by taking the majority vote count of the indicators return from our result. If there is similar number of majority vote count obtained, we consider the QU indicators from the items that have the highest similarity score. Once we obtained the best predicted QU indicator for each reviews, we check with the actual labelled\nQU indicators and present the results in a confusion matrix. Next, we calculate precision, recall and F-measure based on the following formulas adapted from information retrieval proposed by Manning, Raghavan and Schütze [6]:\nPrecision, P (“Fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant”)\nRecall, R (“Fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved”)\nF-measure (“weighted harmonic mean of precision recall”)"

      "heading" : "9 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "The following figure shows the F-measure in predicting the three indicators using three subspaces built from different corpus as explained in Section 6.\nFigure 2 show that the overall best performance is using the journal paragraphs (Experiment 1). The overall average of F-measure is 0.3627. Although combining both journal paragraph and Amazon increases slightly the accuracy of Effectiveness, however, the other two indicators’ accuracies declined due to the presence of noises when combined both resources. The following example illustrated correctly predicted sentences which were in agreement with experts.\nWe can see above that even though the items and reviews do not have much overlapping words, they still can be detected as similar. This indicates our methods able to find similar documents based on word usages. However, there are several cases where our approach was unable to detect the correct indicators.\nCarefully analysis in Table 6 reveals that two sentences that have similar meaning does not necessarily end up in the same category due to different interpretation and annotation. Besides that, some of the reviews sentences are ambiguity which can be interpreted differently; in this case we need to look at the overall contexts. For example, “product worked great”, this reviews can belongs to any indicators based on what criteria that make the author think it works great. In our experiments, the testing category will be predicted according to the similar measurement scales that we used. However, we have proved that by enriching the semantic space it can improve the LSA performance in finding related texts. It actually improved the word usage and increases the accuracy. This is based on our findings in looking into the similar items context found individually.\nBased on the results, we found out that term weighting algorithm used affect the performance because some frequently occur words dominate the semantic space even though the words do not contribute much\ninformation needed. The results below show the comparison between TFIDF and log entropy.\nThe result showed that log entropy performs slightly better than TFIDF but still can be improved by considering other term weighting algorithm in future."

      "heading" : "10 FUTURE WORKS",
      "text" : "Although our study at this point is encouraging, the following are the planned future works.\n1. We intend to obtain more measurement items to be projected into the semantic space to better detect the QU characteristics in reviews. So far, some reviews not able to be detected due to the lacking of measurement items.\n2. Another approach to improve the performance is to enhance the semantic space by training it with more vocabularies. Based on the results, rich semantic space can help to improve overall performance.\n3. We would need to undergo detailed preprocessing on the reviews before it analyzed by LSA due to the noise in the reviews might affect the performance.\n4. In the semantic space, words with higher cooccurrence will dominate the overall\ninformation retrieval process. Log entropy performs better than TFIDF but it still cannot solve the main problem when the words are given wrong priority. We would like to take alternatives in investigating better approach in normalizing the weights to the main keywords which are more significant."

We adapted a set of measurement items from Human Behavior Project to determine if reviews are comply to QU characteristics. We proposed the method of LSA universal semantic space and subspace. We enriched the universal semantic space with reviews and QU indicators’ measurement scales context and build subspace to map similar reviews and measurement scales based on their semantic meaning. The reported results showed that QU indicators in reviews can be predicted with average F-measure of 0.3627. Several limitations caused this works even challenging\nwhere there exist different interpretations between our measurement scales and annotated reviews, ambiguous words usage. We realize that the usage of human words is varied and we shall improve the detection process by incorporate more vocabularies to enhance the semantic space and introducing better information retrieval algorithms to rigorously capture the main context."
