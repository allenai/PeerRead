Three popular weighting schemes were examined: the inverse document frequency weight, probabilistic weighting, and statistical language modelling. The Idea is to combine the statistical approaches with linguistic approaches to reach an optimal performance, and compare their effect on retrieval. The LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) Arabic Newswire data set was used with the Lemur Toolkit. The Best Match weighting scheme used in the Okapi retrieval system had the best overall performance of the three weighting algorithms used in the study, stoplists improved retrieval effectiveness especially when used with the BM25 weight.

      "text" : "Although most of the research in the field of information retrieval has focused on the English language, recently there has been a considerable amount of work and effort to develop information retrieval systems for languages other than English. Research and experimentation in the field of information retrieval in the Arabic language is relatively new and limited compared to the research that has been done in English, which has been dominant in the field of information retrieval for a long while. This is despite the fact that the Arabic Language is one of the five languages of the United Nations, the mother tongue of over 256 million people. In addition, because it is the language of the Qur’an, it is also the second language for many Moslems and Moslem countries around the world [4].\nThis study attempts to compare the use and effect of stop words for Arabic information retrieval. Using the Lemur Toolkit, a language modeling and information retrieval package (see Methodology for more details), multiple weighting schemes, and three stopword lists are implemented in order to determine the effect of\nstop words elimination on an Arabic information retrieval system.\nThe weighting schemes to be used are the TF*IDF weight, the best match weight (BM25), and the statistical language modelling (KL). Three stop words lists will be created, a general list, a corpusbased list, and a combined list. Although Stemming is an important factor when dealing with Arabic information retrieval, it was not implemented in this study in order to isolate the effect of stop words from any other factor."

      "text" : "Stopwords are very common words that appear in the text that carry little meaning; they serve only a syntactic function but do not indicate subject matter. These stopwords have two different impacts on the information retrieval process. They can affect the retrieval effectiveness because they have a very high frequency and tend to diminish the impact of frequency differences among less common words, affecting the weighting process. The removal of the\n2\nstopwords also changes the document length and subsequently affects the weighting process. They can also affect efficiency due to their nature and the fact that they carry no meaning, which may result in a large amount of unproductive processing [9]. The removal of the stopwords can increase the efficiency of the indexing process as 30 to 50% of the tokens in a large text collection can represent stopwords [18].\nIdentifying a stopwords list or a stoplist that contain such words in order to eliminate them from text processing is essential to an information retrieval system. Stoplists can be divided into two categories; domain independent stoplists and domain dependent stoplists. They can be created using syntactic classes or using corpus statistics, which is a more domain dependent approach, used for well-defined fields. They can also be created using a combination of the syntactic classes and corpus statistics to obtain the benefits of both approaches.\nFox [6] was the first to create an English stoplist to be used for general text based on word usage in English. He generated a stoplist that consisted of 421 words which was used later with in the Okapi retrieval system. Fox’s method in creating the list is the most frequently used method; it is a domain independent approach. The problem with this method is that there are several arbitrary decisions to be taken during the creation of the list, such as the cut-off point. The elimination of some words and addition of others is based on personal judgment, which requires a certain expertise with the language in hand. There is no general standard stoplist to use in an IR experiment for the Arabic language. The stoplist used in the Lemur Toolkit is the one created by Khoja [8] when she was creating her Arabic stemmer and is relatively short (168 words). This list was used by Larkey and Connell [11] and Larkey, Ballesteros and Connell [10]. Chen and Gey [5] used a list they created by translating an English list and augmenting it with high frequency words from the corpus creating a rather large list, 1,131 words. They do not discuss the effect of the list. Savoy and Rasolofo’s stoplist 1 [17] is a domain dependent list which has three problems. First they use some words preceded by the letter waw “و” which means “and” in 17 words including 11 duplicates. This letter comes in its separate format in a large portion of words in the Arabic language and could precede all the words in the language with no exceptions. A more efficient way to do this is to remove it using a good stemming algorithm. Second, they remove several other single letters with the waw namely the hamza “،”, alef “ا, أ”, ba’ “ب”, heh “ه”. Due to the way the Arabic language is written, these letters can come separately but they are still a part of the word and removing them changes the word meaning or leave it meaningless, e.g.\n1 The stoplists for all the languages are available at http://www.unine.ch/info/clef\nthe word “باَتك” which could mean book, writers, or a place for learning has the letter ba’ as a single separate letter and when it is removed the word is meaningless. The third problem is that some of the words used in it are not stopwords even though they appeared frequently in the analysis of the corpus statistics, for example, “تايلاولا” States, “ةدحتملا” United, “ةرهاقلا” Cairo, etc. In addition, it is a more domain dependent list so it may not be suitable for other collections."

These techniques are examined using a large corpus that was not available before the introduction of Arabic Cross-Language Retrieval at TREC 2001. The evaluation used the Lemur Toolkit with Arabic language capability.\nThe study evaluates these techniques using the standard recall and precision measures as the basis for comparison. It answers the following question:\n What is the effect of the stoplists on retrieval, i.e. how sensitive is retrieval to the use of stopwords;\nand which one of the lists, the general, the corpus based, or the combined list is superior to the other?\nFirst, performance of term weighting schemes without elimination of stopwords was compared, and then combinations of weighting schemes, and stoplists were run. Using statistical analysis, the effectiveness of all techniques was evaluated to determine which combination achieves the optimal performance for Arabic language retrieval."

The results of the experiments were mapped against the relevance judgments that are available for the data set. Standard recall and precision measures were calculated using the ireval.pl routine in the Toolkit. The evaluation was based on the use of eleven levels of recall creating the recall/precision matrix.\nThe Lemur toolkit was chosen for several reasons. It supports the construction of basic text retrieval systems using language modelling methods, as well as traditional methods such as those based on the vector space model and Okapi. It is available on the Web as open source software written in C and C++, and runs on both UNIX and Windows (NT). It was developed by collaboration between the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts and the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.\nArabic language capability was recently added to the Toolkit by Leah Larkey. This addition has solved the problem of the availability of an Arabic retrieval system for research and experimentation. The Toolkit uses Windows CodePage 1256 encoding (CP1256).\nThe Toolkit comes equipped with TextQueryRetMethods that implement a basic TF*IDF vector space model, Okapi, and a language modeling method using the Kullback-Leibler similarity measure between document and query language models. Initially these algorithms were used without stemming or stoplists. Each of these algorithms requires several parameters to be set in order to function properly. The parameters that were used were the default parameters set in Lemur. Several unofficial runs were conducted in an attempt to tune these parameters to the collection in hand but this did not improve the results over the defaults in Lemur.\nThese parameters are as follows: TF*IDF parameters: K1 = 1, B = 0.3; BM25 Parameters: K1 = 1.2, B = 0.75, K3 = 7; KL-Divergence Model parameter: The KL model needs only one parameter that is used for the smoothing algorithm applied in it. This study uses the\nsimple KL model with the Dirichlet Prior smoothing algorithm and the Dirichlet Prior parameter was set to 2000 as a typical value for that parameter since currently there is no good way of estimating it [23]."

      "heading" : "3.4. Stoplists",
      "text" : "A general stoplist was created, based on the Arabic language structure and characteristics without any additions. All possible words or articles that may be considered a stopword were collated from the different syntactic classes in Arabic in a systematic way to ensure the completeness of the list. The word categories [1, 2] that were used are:  Adverbs.  Conditional Pronouns.  Interrogative Pronouns.  Prepositions.  Pronouns.  Referral Names/Determiners.  Relative Pronouns  Transformers (verbs, letters).  Verbal Pronouns.  Other. Choosing a word from any of these categories was based on a personal judgment. Not all the words under these categories were used, as some of them were not considered stopwords.\nThe resulting list consisted of 1,377 words. The list was checked against Khoja [8] and Alshehri’s [3] lists, and two Standard English lists, the Okapi and SMART lists. The reason for having a large number of stopwords is due to the characteristics of the Arabic language. First, in Arabic several letters can be used as prefixes and may change the meaning of the word. These letters are (\" \" \"فكل\" \" \" \" أ\" \"ب \"), and they were used on some of the words, not all of them, that they could be used with. Second, a considerable number of the original words from these categories could be joined together and used as suffixes or prefixes, especially the pronouns. Finally, the conjunction letter WAW meaning “and” could be used in the same way but was not because it could be used for all Arabic words with no exception and it would not be realistic to use it.\nIn order to test the effect of a corpus-based stoplist, a second list was created. A cut-off point determining a certain number of words at which the list will stop, was decided based on the corpus statistics. Words occurring more than 25,000 times were used to create this list. Preliminary examination of the corpus wordfrequency statistics showed that this is a reasonable number to use as the cut-off point, even though it may appear to be an arbitrary decision.\nUnder this condition, 359 words occurred with a frequency of more than 25,000. Then doing a manual check to remove any content bearing word, which may not be considered a conventional stopword, from this list. The removal of these words is another\n4\narbitrary decision based on personal judgment, and the reason for doing this is that there are no clear rules on stopwords list creation. The resulting list contained 235 words. A third stoplist created using both the general and corpus-based stoplist. Combining both lists resulted in a list of 1,529 words. Of these 83 words were in common between the two lists."

The Friedman Two-Way ANOVA test and the Wilcoxon MatchedPaired Signed-Rank test were used for judging whether measured differences between different methods can be considered statistically significant or not.\nHull [7] has examined the validity of different statistical techniques that are used in comparing retrieval experimental results. He states that there are two non-parametric alternatives to the t-test that make no assumptions about the shapes of the distributions of the two variables, the Wilcoxon Matched-Paired Signed-Rank test and the sign test.\nThe sign test looks only at the sign of the difference, ignoring its magnitude. If one method performs better than the other far more frequently than would be expected on average, then this is strong evidence that it is superior. The Wilcoxon test replaces each difference with the rank of its absolute value. These ranks are then multiplied by the sign of the difference, and the sum of the ranks for each group is compared to its expected value under the assumption that the two groups are equal.\nThe reason for choosing the Wilcoxon signed rank test over the sign test is that it is a more powerful and indicative test as it considers the relative magnitude in addition to the direction of the differences considered [19]. It also assumes that as differences between pairs increase, significance also increases [16].\nHull also indicates that when comparing more than two retrieval methods, the Friedman Two-Way ANOVA is appropriate. It is a non-parametric equivalent to the One-Way ANOVA that does not require any assumptions. It is used to compare observations repeated on the same subjects, which is the case in hand. It uses the ranks of the data rather than their raw values to calculate the statistic [19].\nIn this study the Friedman Two-Way ANOVA test was used to indicate if there is a significant difference on multiple techniques, then it was followed by the Wilcoxon Matched-Paired Signed-Rank test which was used to test pair-wise differences.\n5"

This was not surprising considering the wide variety of techniques used but the test does not depict individual differences between two techniques.\nIn order to explore these differences, the techniques are grouped according to weighting scheme, and stoplists and combinations of them. For each group of retrieval techniques the significance testing starts with the Friedman Two-way ANOVA test to observe the differences between all techniques used are statistically significant. Then, a post-hoc test using the Wilcoxon Matched-Paired Signed-Rank test was performed to determine the difference between paired techniques. Due to the number of techniques used and the number of different combinations of them, it was impractical to do a pair-wise comparison on all of them.

The differences between the three weighting schemes were very minimal and not statistically significant.\nThe TF*IDF scheme is the best weighting scheme to be used with the Arabic language when used separately without stemming or stopwords removal. This contradicts some previous research indicating that the BM25 algorithm is better when used with Arabic [17].\nOne reason for this is that the term frequency portion of the TF*IDF scheme in Lemur is calculated using the term frequency portion in BM25 giving it the advantages of both of schemes. A second is that in Savoy and Rasolofo’s experiment the BM25 was combined with a stemmer which particularly boosts the results with Arabic language.\nThree stoplists were created for this study, a general stoplist, a corpus-based stoplist, and a combined stolist. The assumption here was that stopwords affect the retrieval process but the extent of this effect was not known. The results showed that this effect varies from one weighting scheme to the other. Combining the stoplists with the TFIDF and KL model did not make a substantial difference, only 0.1%-0.2% increase in the former and decrease in the latter.

Unfortunately there are no clear-cut rules on how to create a list like this and most of the decisions that were taken in creating this list were arbitrary.\nGenerally the overall performance of the general stoplist was better than the corpus-based stoplist and to some extent better than the combined stoplist. The list can be used as a standard list for Arabic retrieval regardless of the nature of the data used. The list will be added to the Lemur Toolkit making it available for research and further development as there are no publicly available stoplists for Arabic language.\nAs for the Lemur Toolkit, one of the main objectives of this study was to use it in experimenting with Arabic language retrieval. The addition of the Arabic language to the Lemur Toolkit will benefit the language as it facilitates the retrieval process whatever the approach that is followed. A major advantage of the toolkit is that it is open source software making it easy to add or modify applications.

In this study several retrieval techniques and their potential in improving retrieval effectiveness were explored. The effects of term weighting, and stopwords on Arabic retrieval were examined and compared using the Lemur Toolkit.\nThe best match algorithm, BM25, with the combined or general stoplist was the best performing function for retrieval in the Arabic language. The performance of a general stoplist or a combined list was relatively close. The use of any of them is recommended but the general stoplist is certainly preferred if we are dealing with a different corpus.\nThe Kullback-Leibler Divergence Model had problems performing with stopwords. Further investigation with the model could reveal the extent of this problem especially when dealing with different smoothing algorithms and variant query lengths.\n8\nDeveloping a new weighting algorithm that could use the characteristics of the Best Match algorithm, BM25, and combining it with language specific characteristics may lead to further improvements. For instance, using the syntactical structure of the Arabic sentence in calculating the term weight with the BM25 could improve upon the efficiency of this algorithm.\nLemur comes equipped with several applications; this study has used only a small percentage of these applications. Experimenting with the other applications provided by the toolkit to determine their performance in Arabic is another area that could be explored, for instance the use of feedback in retrieval, summarization…etc."

Three popular weighting schemes were examined: the inverse document frequency weight, probabilistic weighting, and statistical language modelling. The Idea is to combine the statistical approaches with linguistic approaches to reach an optimal performance, and compare their effect on retrieval. The LDC (Linguistic Data Consortium) Arabic Newswire data set was used with the Lemur Toolkit. The Best Match weighting scheme used in the Okapi retrieval system had the best overall performance of the three weighting algorithms used in the study, stoplists improved retrieval effectiveness especially when used with the BM25 weight. The overall performance of a general stoplist was better than the other two lists.",
