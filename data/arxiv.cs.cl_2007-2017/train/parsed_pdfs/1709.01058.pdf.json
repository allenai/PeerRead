      "text" : "Recently both question generation and question answering tasks are receiving increasing attention from both the industrial and academic communities. The task of question generation (QG) is to generate a fluent and relevant question given a passage and a target answer, while the task of question answering (QA) is to generate a correct answer given a passage and a question. Both tasks have massive industrial values: QA has been used in industrial products such as search engines, while QG is helpful for improving QA systems by automatically increasing the training data. It can also be used to generate question for educational purposes such as language learning.\nFor the QG task, existing work either entirely ignores the target answer (Du, Shao, and Cardie, 2017) while generating the corresponding question, or directly hard-codes the answer positions into the passage (Zhou et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Subramanian et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2017;\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nWang, Yuan, and Trischler, 2017; Yuan et al., 2017), so that sequence-to-sequence model (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le, 2014) can be simply utilized. These methods only highlight the answer positions, but neglect other potential interactions between the passage and the target answer. In addition, this kind of methods will shrivel when the target answer does not occur in the passage verbatim. For the QA task, most of the existing literatures (Wang and Jiang, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Xiong, Zhong, and Socher, 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2017) focus on the extractive QA scenario, where they assume that the target answer occurs in the passage verbatim. The task then is to extract a span of consecutive words from the passage as the final answer. However, these methods may not work well on the generative QA scenario, where the correct answer is not a span in the given passage.\nIn this paper, we cast both the QG and QA tasks into one process by firstly matching the input passage against the query, then generating the output according to the matching results. Our model follows the classic encoder-decoder framework, where the encoder takes a passage and a query as input, then performs query understanding by matching the query with the passage from multiple perspectives, and the decoder is an attention-based LSTM model with copy (Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; See, Liu, and Manning, 2017) and coverage (Tu et al., 2016; Mi et al., 2016) mechanisms. In the QG task, the input query is the target answer, and the decoder generates a question for the target answer, whereas in the QA task, the input query is a question, and the decoder generates the corresponding answer. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work dealing with both tasks using the same framework. In the QG task, we are the first to investigate query understanding before generating questions. By matching the target answer against the passage from multiple perspectives, our model captures more interactions between the answer and the passage, so that it can generate more precise question for the answer. Moreover, our model does not require that the answer literally occurs in the passage. In the QA task, our model generate answers word by word, and it has the capacity to generate answers that does not literally occur in the passage. Therefore, it naturally works for the generative QA scenario.\nWe first pretrain the model with the cross-entropy loss,\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n01 05\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nS ep\n2 01\n7\nthen fine tune with policy-gradient reinforcement learning to alleviate the exposure bias problem, resulted by sequence learning with the cross-entropy loss. In our policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, we adopt a similar sampling strategy as the scheduled sampling strategy (Bengio et al., 2015) for generating the sampled output. We perform experiments on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) for the QG task, and on the “description” subset of the MSMARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) dataset for the generative QA task. Experimental results on the QG task show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-arts methods, and the automatically generated questions can even improve an extractive QA system. For the generative QA task, our model shows better performances than other generative systems."

The model takes two components as input: a passage P = (p1, ..., pj , ..., pN ) of length N , and a query Q = (q1, ..., qi, ..., qM ) of length M , then generates the output sequence X = (x1, ..., xL) word by word. Specifically, the model follows the encoder-decoder framework. The encoder matches each time-step of the passage against all time-steps of the query from multiple perspectives, and encodes the matching result into a “Multi-perspective Memory”. In addition, the decoder generates the output sequence one word at a time based on the “Multi-perspective Memory”."

      "heading" : "Multi-Perspective Matching Encoder",
      "text" : "The left-hand side of Figure 1 depicts the architecture of our encoder. Its goal is to perform comprehensive understanding of the query and the passage. The encoder first represents all\nwords within the passage and the query with word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013). In order to incorporate contextual information into the representation of each time-step of the passage or the query, we utilize a bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) layer to encode the passage and the query individually:\n←− hqi = LSTM( ←−− hqi+1, qi) −→ hqi = LSTM( −−→ hqi−1, qi) ←− hpj = LSTM( ←−− hpj+1, pj) −→ hpj = LSTM( −−→ hpj−1, pj),\nwhere qi and pj are embedding of the i-th word in the query and the j-th word in the passage. Then, the contextual vectors for each time-step of the query and the passage are constructed by concatenating the outputs from the BiLSTM layer: hqi = [ ←− hqi ; −→ hqi ] and h p j = [ ←− hpj ; −→ hpj ].\nWe utilize a matching layer on top of the contextual vectors to match each time-step of the passage with all time-steps of the query. Apparently, this is the most crucial layer in our encoder. Inspired by Wang, Hamza, and Florian (2017), we adopt the multi-perspective matching method for the matching layer. We define four matching strategies, as shown in Figure 2, to match the passage with the query from multiple granularities.\n(1) Full-Matching. As shown in Figure 2 (a), each forward (or backward) contextual vector of the passage is compared with the last time-step of the forward (or backward) representation of the query.\n(2) Maxpooling-Matching. As shown in Figure 2 (b), each forward (or backward) contextual vector of the passage\nis compared with every forward (or backward) contextual vectors of the query, and only the maximum value of each dimension is retained.\n(3) Attentive-Matching. As shown in Figure 2 (c), we first calculate the cosine similarities between each forward (or backward) contextual vector of the passage and every forward (or backward) contextual vectors of the question. Then, we take the cosine similarities as the weights, and calculate an attentive vector for the entire query by weighted summing all the contextual vectors of the query. Finally, we match each forward (or backward) contextual vector of the passage with its corresponding attentive vector.\n(4) Max-Attentive-Matching. As shown in Figure 2 (d), this strategy is similar to the Attentive-Matching strategy. However, instead of taking the weighed sum of all the contextual vectors as the attentive vector, we pick the contextual vector with the highest cosine similarity as the attentive vector. Then, we match each contextual vector of the passage with its new attentive vector.\nThese four match strategies require a function fm to match two vectors. Theoretically, any functions for matching two vectors would work here. Inspired by Wang et al. (2016), we adopt the multi-perspective cosine matching function defined as:\nm = fm(v1, v2;W),\nwhere v1 and v2 are d-dimensional input vectors, W ∈ Rl×d is the learnable parameter of multi-perspective weight, and l is the number of perspectives. Each row Wk ∈ W represents the weights associated with one perspective, and the\nsimilarity according to that perspective is defined as:\nmk = cos(Wk ◦ v1,Wk ◦ v2),\nwhere ◦ is the element-wise multiplication operation. So fm(v1, v2;W) represents the matching results between v1 and v2 from all perspectives. Intuitively, each perspective calculates the cosine similarity between two input vectors, and it is associated with a weight vector trained to highlight different dimensions of the input vectors. This can be regarded as considering different part of the semantics captured in the vector.\nThe final matching vector mj for each time-step of the passage is the concatenation of the matching results of all four strategies. We also employ another BiLSTM layer on top of the matching layer to smooth the matching results. We concatenate the contextual vectors, hpj , of the passage and matching vectors to be the Multi-perspective Memory H, which contains both the passage information and the matching information."

      "heading" : "LSTM Decoder",
      "text" : "The right-hand side of Figure 1 is our decoder. Basically, it is an attention-based LSTM model (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio, 2014) with copy and coverage mechanisms. The decoder takes the “Multi-perspective Memory” as the attention memory, and generates the output one word at a time.\nConcretely, while generating the t-th word xt, the decoder considers five factors as the input: (1) the “Multiperspective Memory” H = {h0, ..., hi, ..., hN}, where each vector hi ∈ H aligns to the i-th word in the passage; (2) the previous hidden state of the LSTM model st−1; (3) the embedding of previously generated word xt−1; (4) the previous context vector ct−1, which is calculated from the attention mechanism with H being the attentional memory; and (5) the previous coverage vector ut−1, which is the accumulation of all attention distributions so far. When t = 0, we initialize s−1, c−1 and u−1 as zero vectors, and fix x−1 to be the embedding of the sentence start token “<s>”.\nFor each time-step t, the decoder first feeds the concatenation of the previous word embedding xt−1 and context vector ct−1 into the LSTM model to update the hidden state:\nst = LSTM(st−1, [xt−1, ct−1])\nSecond, the attention distribution αt,i for each time-step of the “Multi-perspective Memory” hi ∈ H is calculated with the following equations:\net,i = v T e tanh(Whhi +Wsst +Wuut−1 + be) αt,i = exp(et,i)∑N j=1 exp(et,j)\nwhereWh,Ws,Wv , be and ve are learnable parameters. The coverage vector ut is then updated by ut = ut−1 + αt. And the new context vector ct is calculated via:\nct = N∑ i=1 αt,ihi\nThen, the output probability distribution over a vocabulary of words at the current state is calculated by:\nPvocab = softmax(V2(V1[st, ct] + b1) + b2),\nwhere V1, V2, b1 and b2 are learnable parameters. The number of rows in V2 represents the number of words in the vocabulary.\nOn top of the LSTM decoder, we adopt the copy mechanism (Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; See, Liu, and Manning, 2017) to integrate the attention distribution into the final vocabulary distribution. The probability distribution is defined as the interpolation between two probability distributions:\nPfinal = gtPvocab + (1− gt)Pattn,\nwhere gt is the switch for controlling generating a word from the vocabulary or directly copying it from the passage. Pvocab is the generating probability distribution as defined above, and Pattn is calculated based on the attention distribution αt by merging probabilities of duplicated words. Intuitively, gt is relevant to the current decoder state, the attention results and the input. Therefore, inspired by See, Liu, and Manning (2017), we define it as:\ngt = σ(w T c ct + w T s st + w T x xt−1 + bg),\nwhere vectors wc, ws, wx and scalar bg are learnable parameters."

      "text" : "A common way of training a sequence generation model is to optimize the log-likelihood of the gold-standard output sequence Y ∗ = y∗0 , ..., y ∗ t , ..., y ∗ T with the cross-entropy loss:\nlce = − T∑\nt=1\nlog p(y∗t |y∗t−1, ..., y∗0 , X; θ),\nwhere X is the model input, and θ represents the trainable model parameters.\nHowever, this method suffers from two main issues. First, during the training stage, the ground-truth of the previous word y∗t−1 is taken as the input to predict the probabilities of the next word yt. But, in the testing stage, the groundtruth y∗t−1 is not available, and the model has to rely on the previously generated word yt−1. If the model selected a different yt−1 than the ground-truth y∗t−1, then the following generated sequence could deviate from the gold-standard sequence. This issue is known as the “exposure bias problem”. Second, models trained with the cross-entropy loss are optimized for the log-likelihood of a sequence which is different from the evaluation metrics.\nIn this work, we utilize a reinforcement learning method to address the exposure bias problem and directly optimize the evaluation metrics. Concretely, we adopt the “REINFORCE with a baseline” algorithm (Williams, 1992), a wellknown policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm, to train our model, because it has shown the effectiveness for several sequence generation tasks (Paulus, Xiong, and\nData: gold-standard sequence Y ∗\nData: greedy search sequence Ŷ Result: sampled sequence Y s\n1 S ← []; 2 for i in range(len(Y ∗)) do 3 if i < len(Ŷ ) then 4 if random.random() < pflip then 5 S.append(Ŷ [i]) ; 6 else 7 S.append(Y ∗[i]) ; 8 end 9 else\n10 S.append(Y ∗[i]) ; 11 end"

      "text" : "Algorithm 1: Scheduled Sampling Strategy\nSocher, 2017; Rennie et al., 2016). Formally, the loss function is defined as:\nlrl = (r(Ŷ )− r(Y s)) T∑\nt=1\nlog p(yst |yst−1, ..., ys0, x; θ),\nwhere Y s = ys0, ..., y s T is the sampled sequence, Ŷ is the sequence generated from a baseline, and the function r(Y ) is the reward calculated based on the evaluation metric. Intuitively, the loss function lrl enlarges the log-probability of the sampled sequence Y s, if Y s is better than the baseline Ŷ in terms of the evaluation metric r(Y ), or vice versa. In this work, for the QG task, we use the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) as the reward, and for the QA task, we use the ROUGE score (Lin, 2004) as the reward.\nFollowing Rennie et al. (2016), we take the greedy search result from the current model as the baseline sequence Ŷ . Rennie et al. (2016) generated the sampled sequence Y s according to the probability distribution of p(yst |yst−1, ..., ys1, x; θ). However, this sampling strategy doesn’t work well for our tasks. One possible reason is that our tasks have much larger search space. Inspired by Bengio et al. (2015), we designed a new “Scheduled Sampling” strategy to construct the sampled sequence Y s from both the gold-standard sequence Y ∗ and the greedy search sequence Ŷ . As shown in Algorithm 1, it goes through the gold-standard sequence Y ∗ word by word (Line 2), and replaces with the corresponding word from the greedy search sequence Ŷ with probability pflip (Line 4-8). If the greedy search sequence is shorter than the gold-standard sequence, the ground-truth word is used after exceeding the end of the greedy search sequence (Line 10). Our experiments show that sampling the sequence according to the model distribution, as Rennie et al. (2016) does, usually produces outputs worse than the greedy search sequence, so it does not help very much. On the other hand, our sampling strategy usually generates better outputs than the greedy search sequence."

      "text" : "We conduct experiments on two tasks: question generation (QG) and generative question answering (QA).\nQuestion Generation For the QG task, we evaluate the quality of generated questions with some automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and ROUGE (Lin, 2004), as well as their effectiveness in improving an extractive QA system. We conduct experiments on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) by comparing our model with Du, Shao, and Cardie (2017) and Zhou et al. (2017) in terms of BLEU, METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) and ROUGE. The dataset contains 536 articles and over 100k questions related to the articles. Here, we follow Du, Shao, and Cardie (2017) and Zhou et al. (2017) to conduct experiments on the accessible part as our entire dataset. Since Du, Shao, and Cardie (2017) and Zhou et al. (2017) conducted their experiments using different training/dev/test split, we conduct experiments on both splits, and compare with their reported performance.\nIn addition, we also evaluate our model from a more practical aspect by examining whether the automatically generated questions are helpful for improving an extractive QA system. We use the data split of Du, Shao, and Cardie (2017), and conduct experiments on low-resource settings, where only (10%, 20%, or 50%) of the human-labeled questions in the training data are available. For example, in the 10% setting, we first train our QG model with the 10% available training data, then generate questions for the remaining 90% instances in the training data, where the human-labeled questions are abandoned.1 Finally, we train an extractive QA system with the 10% human-labeled questions and the 90% automatically generated questions. The extractive QA system we choose is Wang et al. (2016), but our framework does not make any assumptions about the extractive QA systems being used.\nGenerative QA For this task, we conduct experiments on the MS MARCO dataset (Nguyen et al., 2016), which contains around 100k queries and 1M passages. The designing purpose of this dataset is to generate the answer given the top 10 returned documents from a search engine, and the answer is not necessary in the documents. Even though the answers in this dataset are human generated rather than extracted from candidate documents, we found that the answers of around 66% questions can be exactly matched in the passage, and a large number of the remaining answers\n1We assume the gold answers are available when generating questions for the remaining 90% instances, and leave automatic answer selection as future work, since the primary goal here is to evaluate the quality of automatically generated questions.\njust have a small difference with the content in the passages.2 Among all types of questions (“numeric”, “entity”, “location”, “person” and “description”), the “description” subset has the most percentage of answers that can not be exactly matched in the passage. Therefore, for the generative QA experiments, we follow Nguyen et al. (2016) to conduct experiments on the “description” subset, and compare with their reported results.\nFor both tasks, our model is first trained for 15 epochs with the cross-entropy loss, then fine-tuned for 15 epochs using our policy gradient algorithm. Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is used for parameter optimization, and the learning rate is set to 0.005 and 0.0001 for cross entropy and policy gradient phases respectively. The encoder and decoder share the same pre-trained word embeddings, which are the 300-dimensional GolVe (Pennington, Socher, and Manning, 2014) word vectors pre-trained from the 840B common crawl corpus, and the embeddings are not updated during training. For all experiments, the flip probability pflip is set 0.1, the number of perspectives l is set 5, and the weight for the coverage loss η is set 0.1. For all experiments, the model yielding the best performance on the dev set is picked for evaluation on the test set."

We also implement two versions of our model: (1) MPQG is our model only trained with the cross-entropy loss, and (2) MPQG+R is our model fine-tuned with the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm after pretraining.\nFirst, our MPQG model outperforms the comparing systems on both data splits, which shows the effectiveness of our multi-perspective matching encoder. Our MPQG model, which only takes word features, shows even better performance than the feature-rich (POS tag and NER) system of Zhou et al. (2017).

Therefore, the generated questions are independent of the target answer. Zhou et al. (2017) hard-coded the target answer positions into the passage, and employed the sequence-to-sequence model to consume the positionencoded passages, then generate the questions. This method only considered the target answer positions, but neglected the relations between the target answer and other parts of the passage. If the target answer does not literally occur in the passage, this method will shrivel. Conversely, our MPQG model matches the target answer against the passage from multiple perspectives. Therefore, it can capture more interactions between the target answer and the passage, and result in more suitable question for the target answer.\nSecond, our MPQG+R model works better than the MPQG model on both splits, showing the effectiveness of our policy gradient training algorithm.\nTo better illustrate the advantage of our model, we show some comparative results of different models in Table 2, where the Baseline system is our implementation of Zhou et al. (2017) without rich features. Generally, our MPQG model generates better questions than Zhou et al. (2017). Taking the first case as an example, the baseline fails to recognize that “1856” is the year when “nikola tesla” is born, while our MPQG learns that from the pattern “day month year - day month year”, which frequently occurs in the training data. For the third case, the baseline fails to generate the\ncorrect output as the query is very long and complicated. On the other hand, our MPQG model is able to capture that, because it performs comprehensive matching between the target answer and the passages. In addition, our MPQG+R model fixes some small mistakes of MPQG by directly optimizing the evaluation metrics, such as the second case in Table 2."

Here F1 measures the overlap between the prediction and the reference in terms of bags of tokens, and exact match (EM) measures the percentage where the prediction is identical to the reference (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). The baseline is trained only on the part where gold questions are available, while the others are trained on the combination of the gold questions and the automatically generated questions, but with different methods of generating questions: (1) w/ window, a strong baseline from Yang et al.

This shows the effectiveness of our model. Second, the comparing results between w/ MPQG+R and w/ window show that the improvements of w/ MPQG+R are not due to simply enlarging the training data, but because of the higher quality of the generated questions. Yang et al. (2017) showed that w/ window can significantly improve their baseline, while it is not true in our experiment.

On the other hand, our model can conduct both tasks of QG and QA.\nFor question answering (QA), most previous works (Wang and Jiang, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Xiong, Zhong, and Socher, 2016; Seo et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2016; Yu et al., 2016; Dhingra et al., 2017) focus on the extractive QA scenario, which predicts a continuous span in the passage as the answer. Obviously, they rely on the assumption that the answer can be exactly matched in the passage. On the other hand, our model performs generative QA, which generates the answer word-by-word, and does not rely on this assumption. The generative QA is valuable for studying, as we can not guarantee the assumption being true for all scenarios. Tan et al. (2017) claims to perform generative QA, but it still relies on an extractive QA system by generating answers from the extractive results. One notable exclusion is Yin et al. (2015), which generate factoid answers from a knowledge base (KB). One significant difference is that their method matches the query against a KB, whereas ours performs matching against unstructured texts.

Following the encoder-decoder framework, a multi-perspective matching encoder is designed to perform query and passage understanding, and an LSTM model with coverage and copy mechanisms is leveraged as the decoder to generate the target sequence. In addition, we leverage a policy gradient learning algorithm to alleviate the exposure bias problem, which generative models suffer from when training with the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on both question generation and question answering tasks show superior performances of our model, which outperforms the state-of-the-art models. From the results we conclude that query understanding is important for question generation, and that policy gradient is effective on tackling the exposure bias problem resulted by training with cross-entropy loss."

    "abstractText" : "We propose a query-based generative model for solving both tasks of question generation (QG) and question answering (QA). The model follows the classic encoderdecoder framework. The encoder takes a passage and a query as input then performs query understanding by matching the query with the passage from multiple perspectives. The decoder is an attention-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model with copy and coverage mechanisms. In the QG task, a question is generated from the system given the passage and the target answer, whereas in the QA task, the answer is generated given the question and the passage. During the training stage, we leverage a policy-gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to overcome exposure bias, a major problem resulted from sequence learning with cross-entropy loss. For the QG task, our experiments show higher performances than the state-of-the-art results. When used as additional training data, the automatically generated questions even improve the performance of a strong extractive QA system. In addition, our model shows better performance than the state-of-the-art baselines of the generative QA task.",
