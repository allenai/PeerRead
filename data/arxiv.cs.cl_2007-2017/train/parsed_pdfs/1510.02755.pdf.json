      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Content based Document Classification is one of the biggest challenges in the context of free text mining. This is a problem relevant to many areas of Physical and Social Sciences. At a basic level, it is a challenge of identifying features, useful for classification, in qualitative data. At a more applied level, it can be used for classifying sources (Human, Machine or Nature) of such data. Among the more important recent applications, we note its usage in the Social Networking sites (see [1], [2], [5] and [6]), Medical Sciences [3] and Media [4] among others.\nOne of the major problems with most data classification models is that the classification is essentially blind. Current algorithms on document classifications mostly rely on cluster analysis based on bag-ofwords approach. The basic classifiers that use a bag-of-words approach, or more sophisticated Bayesian classification algorithms all mostly use word frequency in one form or the word. Word sense is almost always ignored. Such methods rely on an ad-hoc idea of the correlatedness between words. While the blind approach should work if we have a documents of reasonable size or a large corpus to begin with, so that we have an easier time picking up signatures of \"good\" or \"bad\" sets, such a method may not work with a smaller size of the set. An author may use a diverse vocabulary, so that overall frequency of good or bad words are low, thereby making classification harder. For example, if \"good\" is a positive word and in the document the author uses the term \"awesome \" multiple times and \"good\" never, we may not capture the document author's positive sentiment by our mechanism. This becomes an especially relevant concern while sentiment extraction from smaller documents, like a tweet or a product review at an online sight.\nHowever such methods are still being applied to many modern scientific dilemmas because of the urgency of the problems.

      "heading" : "1.1 Abstraction of Document in Classification Problem:",
      "text" : "In a typical problem, we are given a set of documents and two prefixed classes in which the documents have to be classified. We have to develop an optimum rule for this classification. The collection of documents is called a corpus.\nThere are multiple ways to visualize a document, the most common among which is the bag-of-words approach. Let our corpus be called c, which contains n documents, namely {d1,d2,...,dn }. Each di contains a finite collection of words, call them {wi1, wi2,...,win}.\nIn Bag-of-Words approach, we can consider the words in conjunction with their frequencies in the document, which, after stemming, are used for classification. However, this destroys the ordering of words which may lead to higher misclassification probability. It makes more sense to consider the document as a finite sequence of words where repetitions are possible.\nOur approach is as follows. Given a training dataset, and assuming a binary classification setup into categories A and B representing good and bad respectively; from our training dataset we can construct two distinct weighted networks of words and phrases that represent the “closeness” of the words and eventually helps us to decide the classification of a document based on the closeness of the contents of this new document with either the “good” network or the “bad”. Thus, in the end, each document belongs to one of the two possible classes - category A or category B. We also extract a set of correlated words or phrases as our features set to be used for further classification.\nHere we will be using WordNet which provides a semantic lexicon for English. WordNet is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2. Structure of WordNet",
      "text" : "WordNet is a lexical dictionary available online free of cost. WordNet is somewhat of an extended version of a thesaurus. The main relation among words in WordNet is synonymy, as between the words shut and close or car and automobile. Synonyms--words that denote the same concept and are interchangeable in many contexts--are grouped into unordered sets (synsets). Each of WordNet’s 117 000 synsets is linked to other synsets by means of a small number of “conceptual relations.” Additionally, a synset contains a brief definition and, in most cases, one or more short sentences illustrating the use of the synset members. Word forms with several distinct meanings are represented in as many distinct synsets. Thus, each form-meaning pair in WordNet is unique.\nBoth nouns and verbs are organized into hierarchies, defined by hypernym or IS A relationships. For instance, one sense of the word dog is found following hypernym hierarchy; the words at the same level represent synset members. Each set of synonyms has a unique index.\ndog, domestic dog, Canisfamiliaris\n=>carnivore\n=>placental, placental mammal, eutherian, eutherian mammal\n=>mammal\n=>vertebrate, craniate\n=>chordate\n=>animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna\n=> ...\nAt the top level, these hierarchies are organized into 25 beginner \"trees\" for nouns and 15 for verbs (called lexicographic files at a maintenance level). All are linked to a unique beginner synset, \"entity.\" Noun hierarchies are far deeper than verb hierarchies\nAdjectives are not organized into hierarchical trees. Instead, two \"central\" antonyms such as \"hot\" and \"cold\" form binary poles, while 'satellite' synonyms such as \"steaming\" and \"chilly\" connect to their respective poles via a \"similarity\" relations. The adjectives can be visualized in this way as \"dumbbells\" rather than as \"trees.\""

      "heading" : "2.1 Notion of Semantic Similarity",
      "text" : "It is easy to define a similarity measure between word pairs via WordNet. WordNet already has a few existing Perl modules. Wordnet:similarity uses a \"is-as\" relationship between nouns to classify them in the same synset. For example, \"dog\" and \"animal\" are closer than \"dog\" and \"closet\" is. Also another point to note is that this “is-as” relationship does not cross parts of speech boundary.\nThis, however, only captures a small notion of similarity between words as there can be many other relations aside from “is-as”. WordNet also contains other non-hierarchical relationships between words which are expanded upon in a “gloss” or definition added."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1.1 Path Similarity",
      "text" : "There are multiple notions of similarity possible in WordNet Lexicography. The three major ones, based on path length, are:\n lch (Leacock & Chodorow 1998) measure =\nwhere d(.,.) is the shortest path between\ntwo concepts a and b in the “is-a” system.\n wup (Wu & Palmer 1994) measure =\nwhere LCS or least\ncommon subsumer of the two concepts is the most specific concept they have as an ancestor.\n path measure =\n, i.e., the path measure is equal to the inverse of the shortest path length\nbetween two concepts.\nIn this regard we start to view documents as a point in the co-ordinate system where X-axis indicates the degree of inclination towards the bad set and Y-axis indicates the degree of inclination towards the good set.\n2.2 Operational Approach\nand with two existing groups of words to be used for classification. Call them w0G = {w1G,...,wnG} and w0B = {w1B,...,wnB}.\nThis wordlist can be given to us, or be captured from a training set. Suppose the wordlist is given. We\ncan then proceed for classification. Pick the document di = {wi1, wi2,...,win}. For each word in the document we calculate the distances from the words of w0G and w0B. We consider the proportion of classification of words to each group. We prefix {ϵ1, ϵ2} in such a way that pA > ϵ1 we classify to group 1; pB > ϵ2 we classify to group 2, anything in between we fail to classify.\nEach word from the WordNet are taken and its distance from categories A is compared with the distance from category B. The distance between two words is considered in terms of number of nodes (intermediate words) between them. If the distance from the category A is greater than the distance from category B then the word which has been taken from the WordNet will be a similar sounding word of category B and thus it will get appended to category B otherwise it gets appended to category A. Like this we can split the words into two categories and expand the given two set of words which will be used later to classify a data. The diagram below illustrates the idea of and leads to the Algorithm that we develop.\n2.3 Graphical Position of a Document in a Appropriate Coordinate System:\nIt is not essential that every document can be sufficiently polarized to have a strong inclination towards to a particular word group. Also, the information content of one document may be higher than that of another document. Say, two newspapers may both support a political party, but one is subtle and another is more vocal. Simply classifying them to the same group ignores the distance in opinion among them. This may also lead to high degree of misclassification in sparse or small sized documents, like tweets, where our strength of evidence is low. In such a case it makes more sense to also report our degree of belief about the classification aside from the class itself. The strength of evidence can be calculated by many metrics, we use the proportion of words classified to group as the strength. Thus, depending on situation, a document may convey strong feelings in favour of both groups simultaneously- for example, an IMDB review that criticizes the action sequences in a movie yet praises the screenplay.\nStarting from the selected list of \"good\" and \"bad\" words, it becomes imperative to create a classification method from both these wordlists. We need to find, in our test datasets, a frequency based measure for this classification. So, starting from the original set, we pick each document with the good words in them and the bad words in them and calculate the frequency of these words in each of the documents. A proportion of words classified as \"good\" and \"bad\" weighted by their frequencies is used for classification. A diagrammatic representation of the algorithm to capture the frequencies of the words is given below."

ALGORITHM\nWe estimate the semantic relatedness of two nouns distance (A, B) as follows:\n• If either A or B is not a WordNet noun, the distance is infinity. • Otherwise, the distance is the minimum length of any ancestral path between any synset v of A and any synset w of B.\nIn this context, we consider the word interchangeably as both words and particular two-word phrases. We proceed in the following manner. Randomly select a document from cG, the corpus of documents in the good set already classified. Call it dG = {w1G,...,wnG}. Similarly define dB = {w1B,...,wnB}.\nWe call = {w1G,...,wnG} and\n= {w1B,...,wnB}.\nNow pick a document, say dG1. Calculate the semantic distance from each word in dG1 from dG and dB. If the word wi is classified to either of these groups, disregard. Else, we append the word wi to our set of good words . Similarly for a “bad” document, we append words to .\nProceed to cover all documents in the training set. Now, this set may have multiple redundancies. We can repeat the procedure by selecting a different choice of initial starting document dG and dB. Let us thus obtain by m repetitions, the set {mGi}, {mBi}, i=1,....,m. From here we select mG to contain the k words from {mGi} that are repeated the maximum number of times. Similarly for mB.\nWe start with two categories of good and bad datasets, and an original collection of words for each set. We want to build up a set of words to extend our initial sets for further classification. We want to empirically determine the threshold values for each of the classes. By our algorithm, for each word to be appended to the good or the bad set, we also need to find the threshold values empirically. So, we randomly select 25000 synsets and apply our algorithm there so as to ascertain the appropriate levels of the threshold."

Thus, via these words, any compound sentence can be broken down into a sequence of {+1,-1} where +1 indicates sentiment towards a good set and -1 that towards a bad.

    "abstractText" : "Content based Document Classification is one of the biggest challenges in the context of free text mining. Current algorithms on document classifications mostly rely on cluster analysis based on bagof-words approach. However that method is still being applied to many modern scientific dilemmas. It has established a strong presence in fields like economics and social science to merit serious attention from the researchers. In this paper we would like to propose and explore an alternative grounded more securely on the dictionary classification and correlatedness of words and phrases. It is expected that application of our existing knowledge about the underlying classification structure may lead to improvement of the classifier's performance.",
