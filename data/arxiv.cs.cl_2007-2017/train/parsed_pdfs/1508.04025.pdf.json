      "text" : "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) achieved state-of-the-art performances in large-scale translation tasks such as from English to French (Luong et al., 2015) and English to German (Jean et al., 2015). NMT is appealing since it requires minimal domain knowledge and is conceptually simple. The model by Luong et al. (2015) reads through all the source words until the end-ofsentence symbol <eos> is reached. It then starts\n1All our code and models are publicly available at http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt.\nemitting one target word at a time, as illustrated in Figure 1. NMT is often a large neural network that is trained in an end-to-end fashion and has the ability to generalize well to very long word sequences. This means the model does not have to explicitly store gigantic phrase tables and language models as in the case of standard MT; hence, NMT has a small memory footprint. Lastly, implementing NMT decoders is easy unlike the highly intricate decoders in standard MT (Koehn et al., 2003).\nIn parallel, the concept of “attention” has gained popularity recently in training neural networks, allowing models to learn alignments between different modalities, e.g., between image objects and agent actions in the dynamic control problem (Mnih et al., 2014), between speech frames and text in the speech recognition task (?), or between visual features of a picture and its text description in the image caption generation task (Xu et al., 2015). In the context of NMT, Bahdanau et al. (2015) has successfully applied such attentional mechanism to jointly translate and align words. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any other work exploring the use of attention-based architectures for NMT.\nIn this work, we design, with simplicity and ef-\nfectiveness in mind, two novel types of attentionbased models: a global approach in which all source words are attended and a local one whereby only a subset of source words are considered at a time. The former approach resembles the model of (Bahdanau et al., 2015) but is simpler architecturally. The latter can be viewed as an interesting blend between the hard and soft attention models proposed in (Xu et al., 2015): it is computationally less expensive than the global model or the soft attention; at the same time, unlike the hard attention, the local attention is differentiable almost everywhere, making it easier to implement and train.2 Besides, we also examine various alignment functions for our attention-based models.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate that both of our approaches are effective in the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. Our attentional models yield a boost of up to 5.0 BLEU over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. For English to German translation, we achieve new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for both WMT’14 and WMT’15, outperforming previous SOTA systems, backed by NMT models and n-gram LM rerankers, by more than 1.0 BLEU. We conduct extensive analysis to evaluate our models in terms of learning, the ability to handle long sentences, choices of attentional architectures, alignment quality, and translation outputs."

      "text" : "A neural machine translation system is a neural network that directly models the conditional probability p(y|x) of translating a source sentence, x1, . . . , xn, to a target sentence, y1, . . . , ym.3 A basic form of NMT consists of two components: (a) an encoder which computes a representation s for each source sentence and (b) a decoder which generates one target word at a time and hence decomposes the conditional probability as:\nlog p(y|x) = ∑m\nj=1 log p (yj|y<j, s) (1)\nA natural choice to model such a decomposition in the decoder is to use a\n2There is a recent work by Gregor et al. (2015), which is very similar to our local attention and applied to the image generation task. However, as we detail later, our model is much simpler and can achieve good performance for NMT.\n3All sentences are assumed to terminate with a special “end-of-sentence” token <eos>.\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which most of the recent NMT work such as (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015) have in common. They, however, differ in terms of which RNN architectures are used for the decoder and how the encoder computes the source sentence representation s.\nKalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013) used an RNN with the standard hidden unit for the decoder and a convolutional neural network for encoding the source sentence representation. On the other hand, both Sutskever et al. (2014) and Luong et al. (2015) stacked multiple layers of an RNN with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden unit for both the encoder and the decoder. Cho et al. (2014), Bahdanau et al. (2015), and Jean et al. (2015) all adopted a different version of the RNN with an LSTM-inspired hidden unit, the gated recurrent unit (GRU), for both components.4\nIn more detail, one can parameterize the probability of decoding each word yj as:\np (yj|y<j, s) = softmax (g (hj)) (2)\nwith g being the transformation function that outputs a vocabulary-sized vector.5 Here, hj is the RNN hidden unit, abstractly computed as:\nhj = f(hj−1, s), (3)\nwhere f computes the current hidden state given the previous hidden state and can be either a vanilla RNN unit, a GRU, or an LSTM unit. In (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015), the source representation s is only used once to initialize the decoder hidden state. On the other hand, in (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015) and this work, s, in fact, implies a set of source hidden states which are consulted throughout the entire course of the translation process. Such an approach is referred to as an attention mechanism, which we will discuss next.\nIn this work, following (Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015), we use the stacking LSTM architecture for our NMT systems, as illustrated\n4They all used a single RNN layer except for the latter two works which utilized a bidirectional RNN for the encoder.\n5One can provide g with other inputs such as the currently predicted word yj as in (Bahdanau et al., 2015).\nin Figure 1. We use the LSTM unit defined in (Zaremba et al., 2015). Our training objective is formulated as follows:\nJt = ∑\n(x,y)∈D − log p(y|x) (4)\nwith D being our parallel training corpus."

      "heading" : "3 Attention-based Models",
      "text" : "Our various attention-based models are classifed into two broad categories, global and local. These classes differ in terms of whether the “attention” is placed on all source positions or on only a few source positions. We illustrate these two model types in Figure 2 and 3 respectively.\nCommon to these two types of models is the fact that at each time step t in the decoding phase, both approaches first take as input the hidden state ht at the top layer of a stacking LSTM. The goal is then to derive a context vector ct that captures relevant source-side information to help predict the current target word yt. While these models differ in how the context vector ct is derived, they share the same subsequent steps.\nSpecifically, given the target hidden state ht and the source-side context vector ct, we employ a simple concatenation layer to combine the information from both vectors to produce an attentional hidden state as follows:\nh̃t = tanh(Wc[ct;ht]) (5)\nThe attentional vector h̃t is then fed through the softmax layer to produce the predictive distribution formulated as:\np(yt|y<t, x) = softmax(Wsh̃t) (6)\nWe now detail how each model type computes the source-side context vector ct."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Global Attention",
      "text" : "The idea of a global attentional model is to consider all the hidden states of the encoder when deriving the context vector ct. In this model type, a variable-length alignment vector at, whose size equals the number of time steps on the source side, is derived by comparing the current target hidden state ht with each source hidden state h̄s:\nat(s) = align(ht, h̄s) (7)\n= exp\n( score(ht, h̄s) )\n∑ s′ exp ( score(ht, h̄s′) )\nHere, score is referred as a content-based function for which we consider three different alternatives:\nscore(ht, h̄s)=\n\n \n \nh ⊤ t h̄s dot h ⊤ t Wah̄s general v ⊤ a tanh ( Wa[ht; h̄s] ) concat\nBesides, in our early attempts to build attentionbased models, we use a location-based function in which the alignment scores are computed from solely the target hidden state ht as follows:\nat = softmax(Waht) location (8)\nGiven the alignment vector as weights, the context vector ct is computed as the weighted average over all the source hidden states.6\nComparison to (Bahdanau et al., 2015) – While our global attention approach is similar in spirit to the model proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2015), there are several key differences which reflect how we have both simplified and generalized from the original model. First, we simply use hidden states at the top LSTM layers in both the encoder and decoder as illustrated in Figure 2. Bahdanau et al. (2015), on the other hand, use the concatenation of the forward and backward source hidden states in the bi-directional encoder\n6Eq. (8) implies that all alignment vectors at are of the same length. For short sentences, we only use the top part of at and for long sentences, we ignore words near the end.\nand target hidden states in their non-stacking unidirectional decoder. Second, our computation path is simpler; we go from ht → at → ct → h̃t then make a prediction as detailed in Eq. (5), Eq. (6), and Figure 2. On the other hand, at any time t, Bahdanau et al. (2015) build from the previous hidden state ht−1 → at → ct → ht, which, in turn, goes through a deep-output and a maxout layer before making predictions.7 Lastly, Bahdanau et al. (2015) only experimented with one alignment function, the concat product; whereas we show later that the other alternatives are better."

      "heading" : "3.2 Local Attention",
      "text" : "The global attention has a drawback that it has to attend to all words on the source side for each target word, which is expensive and can potentially render it impractical to translate longer sequences, e.g., paragraphs or documents. To address this deficiency, we propose a local attentional mechanism that chooses to focus only on a small subset of the source positions per target word.\nThis model takes inspiration from the tradeoff between the soft and hard attentional models proposed by Xu et al. (2015) to tackle the image caption generation task. In their work, soft attention\n7We will refer to this difference again in Section 3.3.\nrefers to the global attention approach in which weights are placed “softly” over all patches in the source image. The hard attention, on the other hand, selects one patch of the image to attend to at a time. While less expensive at inference time, the hard attention model is non-differentiable and requires more complicated techniques such as variance reduction or reinforcement learning to train.\nOur local attention mechanism selectively focuses on a small window of context and is differentiable. This approach has an advantage of avoiding the expensive computation incurred in the soft attention and at the same time, is easier to train than the hard attention approach. In concrete details, the model first generates an aligned position pt for each target word at time t. The context vector ct is then derived as a weighted average over the set of source hidden states within the window [pt−D, pt+D]; D is empirically selected.8 Unlike the global approach, the local alignment vector at is now fixed-dimensional, i.e., ∈ R2D+1. We consider two variants of the model as below.\nMonotonic alignment (local-m) – we simply set pt = t assuming that source and target sequences are roughly monotonically aligned. The alignment vector at is defined according to Eq. (7).9\nPredictive alignment (local-p) – instead of assuming monotonic alignments, our model predicts an aligned position as follows:\npt = S · sigmoid(v ⊤ p tanh(Wpht)), (9)\nWp and vp are the model parameters which will be learned to predict positions. S is the source sentence length. As a result of sigmoid, pt ∈ [0, S]. To favor alignment points near pt, we place a Gaussian distribution centered around pt . Specifically, our alignment weights are now defined as:\nat(s) = align(ht, h̄s) exp\n(\n− (s− pt)\n2\n2σ2\n)\n(10)\nWe use the same align function as in Eq. (7) and the standard deviation is empirically set as σ= D2 . Note that pt is a real nummber; whereas s is an integer within the window centered at pt.10\n8If the window crosses the sentence boundaries, we simply ignore the outside part and consider words in the window.\n9local-m is the same as the global model except that the vector at is fixed-length and shorter.\n10local-p is similar to the local-m model except that we dynamically compute pt and use a truncated Gaussian distribution to modify the original alignment weights align(ht, h̄s) as shown in Eq. (10). By utilizing pt to derive at, we can compute backprop gradients for Wp and vp. This model is differentiable almost everywhere.\nComparison to (Gregor et al., 2015) – have proposed a selective attention mechanism, very similar to our local attention, for the image generation task. Their approach allows the model to select an image patch of varying location and zoom. We, instead, use the same “zoom” for all target positions, which greatly simplifies the formulation and still achieves good performance."

      "heading" : "3.3 Input-feeding Approach",
      "text" : "In our proposed global and local approaches, the attentional decisions are made independently, which is suboptimal. Whereas, in standard MT, a coverage set is often maintained during the translation process to keep track of which source words have been translated. Likewise, in attentional NMTs, alignment decisions should be made jointly taking into account past alignment information. To address that, we propose an inputfeeding approach in which attentional vectors h̃t are concatenated with inputs at the next time steps as illustrated in Figure 4.11 The effects of having such connections are two-fold: (a) we hope to make the model fully aware of previous alignment choices and (b) we create a very deep network spanning both horizontally and vertically.\nComparison to other work – Bahdanau et al. (2015) use context vectors, similar to our ct, in building subsequent hidden states, which can also achieve the “coverage” effect. However, there has not been any analysis of whether such connections are useful as done\n11If n is the number of LSTM cells, the input size of the first LSTM layer is 2n; those of subsequent layers are n.\nin this work. Also, our approach is more general; as illustrated in Figure 4, it can be applied to general stacking recurrent architectures, including non-attentional models.\nXu et al. (2015) propose a doubly attentional approach with an additional constraint added to the training objective to make sure the model pays equal attention to all parts of the image during the caption generation process. Such a constraint can also be useful to capture the coverage set effect in NMT that we mentioned earlier. However, we chose to use the input-feeding approach since it provides flexibility for the model to decide on any attentional constraints it deems suitable."

For end-to-end NMT systems, to the best of our knowledge, (Jean et al., 2015) is the only work experimenting with this language pair and currently the SOTA system.

    "abstractText" : "An attentional mechanism has lately been used to improve neural machine translation (NMT) by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence during translation. However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches on the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems that already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures yields a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT’15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.1",
