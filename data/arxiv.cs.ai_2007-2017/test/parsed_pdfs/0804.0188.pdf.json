      "text" : "Support vector machines (SVM) have become a central tool for solving binary classification problems. A critical step in support vector machine classification is choosing a suitable kernel matrix, which measures similarity between data points and must be positive semidefinite because it is formed as the Gram matrix of data points in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This positive semidefinite condition on kernel matrices is also known as Mercer’s condition in the machine learning literature. The classification problem then becomes a linearly constrained quadratic program. Here, we present an algorithm for SVM classification using indefinite kernels1, i.e. kernel matrices formed using similarity measures which are not positive semidefinite.\nOur interest in indefinite kernels is motivated by several observations. First, certain similarity measures take advantage of application-specific structure in the data and often display excellent empirical classification performance. Unlike popular kernels used in support vector machine classification, these similarity matrices are often indefinite, so do not necessarily correspond to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. (See Ong et al. (2004) for a discussion.)\nIn particular, an application of classification with indefinite kernels to image classification using Earth Mover’s Distance was discussed in Zamolotskikh and Cunningham (2004). Similarity measures for protein sequences such as the Smith-Waterman and BLAST scores are indefinite yet have provided hints for constructing useful positive semidefinite kernels such as those decribed in Saigo et al. (2004) or have been transformed into positive semidefinite kernels with good empirical performance (see Lanckriet et al. (2003), for example). Tangent distance similarity measures, as\n∗ORFE Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544. rluss@alumni.princeton.edu †ORFE Department, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544. aspremon@princeton.edu 1A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems\n(NIPS) 2007 conference and is available at http://books.nips.cc/nips20.html\ndescribed in Simard et al. (1998) or Haasdonk and Keysers (2002), are invariant to various simple image transformations and have also shown excellent performance in optical character recognition. Finally, it is sometimes impossible to prove that some kernels satisfy Mercer’s condition or the numerical complexity of evaluating the exact positive kernel is too high and a proxy (and not necessarily positive semidefinite) kernel has to be used instead (see Cuturi (2007), for example). In both cases, our method allows us to bypass these limitations. Our objective here is to derive efficient algorithms to directly use these indefinite similarity measures for classification.\nOur work closely follows, in spirit, recent results on kernel learning (see Lanckriet et al. (2004) or Ong et al. (2005)), where the kernel matrix is learned as a linear combination of given kernels, and the result is explicitly constrained to be positive semidefinite. While this problem is numerically challenging, Bach et al. (2004) adapted the SMO algorithm to solve the case where the kernel is written as a positively weighted combination of other kernels. In our setting here, we never numerically optimize the kernel matrix because this part of the problem can be solved explicitly, which means that the complexity of our method is substantially lower than that of classical kernel learning algorithms and closer in practice to the algorithm used in Sonnenberg et al. (2006), who formulate the multiple kernel learning problem of Bach et al. (2004) as a semi-infinite linear program and solve it with a column generation technique similar to the analytic center cutting plane method we use here."

      "text" : "Several methods have been proposed for dealing with indefinite kernels in SVMs. A first direction embeds data in a pseudo-Euclidean (pE) space: Haasdonk (2005), for example, formulates the classification problem with an indefinite kernel as that of minimizing the distance between convex hulls formed from the two categories of data embedded in the pE space. The nonseparable case is handled in the same manner using reduced convex hulls. (See Bennet and Bredensteiner (2000) for a discussion on geometric interpretations in SVM.)\nAnother direction applies direct spectral transformations to indefinite kernels: flipping the negative eigenvalues or shifting the eigenvalues and reconstructing the kernel with the original eigenvectors in order to produce a positive semidefinite kernel (see Wu et al. (2005) and Zamolotskikh and Cunningham (2004), for example). Yet another option is to reformulate either the maximum margin problem or its dual in order to use the indefinite kernel in a convex optimization problem. One reformulation suggested in Lin and Lin (2003) replaces the indefinite kernel by the identity matrix and maintains separation using linear constraints. This method achieves good performance, but the convexification procedure is hard to interpret. Directly solving the nonconvex problem sometimes gives good results as well (see Woźnica et al. (2006) and Haasdonk (2005)) but offers no guarantees on performance."

      "text" : "In this work, instead of directly transforming the indefinite kernel, we simultaneously learn the support vector weights and a proxy Mercer kernel matrix by penalizing the distance between this proxy kernel and the original, indefinite one. Our main result is that the kernel learning part of that problem can be solved explicitly, meaning that the classification problem with indefinite kernels can simply be formulated as a perturbation of the positive semidefinite case.\nOur formulation can be interpreted as a penalized kernel learning problem with uncertainty on the input kernel matrix. In that sense, indefinite similarity matrices are seen as noisy observations of a true positive semidefinite kernel and we learn a kernel that increases the generalization performance. From a complexity standpoint, while the original SVM classification problem with indefinite kernel is nonconvex, the penalization we detail here results in a convex problem, and hence can be solved efficiently with guaranteed complexity bounds.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formulate our main classification result and detail its interpretation as a penalized kernel learning problem. In Section 3 we describe three algorithms for solving this problem. Section 4 discusses several extensions of our main results. Finally, in Section 5, we test the numerical performance of these methods on various data sets.\nNotation We write Sn (Sn+) to denote the set of symmetric (positive-semidefinite) matrices of size n. The vector e is the n-vector of ones. Given a matrix X, λi (X) denotes the i\nth eigenvalue of X. X+ is the positive part of the matrix X, i.e. X+ = ∑ i max(0, λi)viv T i where λi and vi are the i th eigenvalue and eigenvector of the matrix X. Given a vector x, ‖x‖1 = ∑ |xi|."

We formulate the kernel learning problem as in Lanckriet et al. (2004), where the authors minimize an upper bound on the misclassification probability when using SVM with a given kernel K. This upper bound is the generalized performance measure\nωC(K) = max {0≤α≤C,αT y=0}\nαT e− Tr(K(Y α)(Y α)T )/2 (1)\nwhere α ∈ Rn and C is the SVM misclassification penalty. This is also the classic 1-norm soft margin SVM problem. They show that ωC(K) is convex in K and solve problems of the form\nmin K∈K ωC(K) (2)\nin order to learn an optimal kernel K∗ that achieves good generalization performance. When K is restricted to convex subsets of Sn+ with constant trace, they show that problem (2) can be reformulated as a convex program. Further restrictions to K reduce (2) to more tractable optimization problems such as semidefinite and quadratically constrained quadratic programs. Our goal is to solve a problem similar to (2) by restricting the distance between a proxy kernel used in classification and the original indefinite similarity measure."

When K is positive semidefinite, this problem is a convex quadratic program. Suppose now that we are given an indefinite kernel matrix K0 ∈ S\nn. We formulate a new instance of problem (2) by restricting K to be a positive semidefinite kernel matrix in some given neighborhood of the original (indefinite) kernel matrix K0 and solve\nmin {K 0, ‖K−K0‖2F≤β} max {αT y=0, 0≤α≤C}\nαT e− 1\n2 Tr(K(Y α)(Y α)T )\nin the variables K ∈ Sn and α ∈ Rn, where the parameter β > 0 controls the distance between the original matrix K0 and the proxy kernel K. This is the kernel learning problem (2) with K = {K 0, ‖K−K0‖ 2 F ≤ β}. The above problem is infeasible for small values of β, so we replace here the hard constraint on K by a penalty ρ on the distance between the proxy kernel and the original indefinite similarity matrix and solve instead\nmin {K 0} max {αT y=0, 0≤α≤C}\nαT e− 1\n2 Tr(K(Y α)(Y α)T ) + ρ‖K −K0‖ 2 F (3)\nBecause (3) is convex-concave and the inner maximization has a compact feasible set, we can switch the max and min to form the dual\nmax {αT y=0,0≤α≤C} min {K 0}\nαT e− 1\n2 Tr(K(Y α)(Y α)T ) + ρ‖K −K0‖ 2 F (4)\nin the variables K ∈ Sn and α ∈ Rn. We first note that problem (4) is a convex optimization problem. The inner minimization problem is a convex conic program on K. Also, as the pointwise minimum of a family of concave quadratic functions of α, the solution to the inner problem is a concave function of α, hence the outer optimization problem is also convex (see Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004) for further details). Thus, (4) is a concave maximization problem subject to linear constraints and is therefore a convex problem in α. Our key result here is that the inner kernel learning optimization problem in (4) can be solved in closed form.\nTheorem 1 Given a similarity matrix K0 ∈ S n, a vector α ∈ Rn of support vector coefficients and the label matrix Y = diag(y), the optimal kernel in problem (4) can be computed explicitly as:\nK∗ = (K0 + (Y α)(Y α) T /(4ρ))+ (5)\nwhere ρ ≥ 0 controls the penalty.\nProof. For a fixed α, the inner minimization problem can be written out as\nmin {K 0}\nαT e+ ρ(Tr(KTK)− 2Tr(KT (K0 + 1\n4ρ (Y α)(Y α)T )) + Tr(KT0 K0))\nwhere we have replaced ‖K−K0‖ 2 F = Tr((K−K0) T (K−K0)) and collected similar terms. Adding and subtracting the constant ρTr((K0+ 1 4ρ(Y α)(Y α) T )T (K0+ 1 4ρ(Y α)(Y α) T )) shows that the inner minimization problem is equivalent to the problem\nminimize ‖K − (K0 + 1 4ρ(Y α)(Y α) T )‖2F subject to K 0\nin the variable K ∈ Sn, where we have dropped the remaining constants from the objective. This is the projection of the matrix K0 +(Y α)(Y α)\nT /(4ρ) on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices, which yields the desired result.\nPlugging the explicit solution for the proxy kernel derived in (5) into the classification problem (4), we get\nmax {αT y=0, 0≤α≤C}\nαT e− 1\n2 Tr(K∗(Y α)(Y α)T ) + ρ‖K∗ −K0‖ 2 F (6)\nin the variable α ∈ Rn, where (Y α)(Y α)T is the rank one matrix with coefficients yiαiαjyj. Problem (6) can be cast as an eigenvalue optimization problem in the variable α. Letting the eigenvalue decomposition of K0 + (Y α)(Y α) T /(4ρ) be V DV T , we get K∗ = V D+V T , and with vi the i th column of V , we can write\nTr(K∗(Y α)(Y α)T ) = (Y α)TV D+V T (Y α)\n= ∑\ni\nmax\n(\n0, λi\n(\nK0 + 1\n4ρ (Y α)(Y α)T\n))\n(αTY vi) 2.\nUsing the same technique, we can also rewrite the term ‖K∗ −K0‖ 2 F using this eigenvalue decomposition. Our original optimization problem (4) finally becomes\nmaximize αT e− 1 2\n∑\nimax(0, λi(K0 + (Y α)(Y α) T /4ρ))(αT Y vi) 2\n+ρ ∑ i (max(0, λi(K0 + (Y α)(Y α) T /4ρ)))2 −2ρ ∑\ni Tr((viv T i )K0)max(0, λi(K0 + (Y α)(Y α) T /4ρ)) + ρTr(K0K0)\nsubject to αT y = 0, 0 ≤ α ≤ C\n(7)\nin the variable α ∈ Rn. By construction, the objective function is concave, hence (7) is a convex optimization problem in α.\nA reformulation of problem (4) appears in Chen and Ye (2008) where the authors move the inner minimization problem to the constraints and get the following semi-infinite quadratically constrained linear program (SIQCLP):\nmaximize t\nsubject to αT y = 0, 0 ≤ α ≤ C\nt ≤ αT e− 1 2 Tr(K(Y α)(Y α)T ) + ρ‖K −K0‖ 2 F ∀K 0.\n(8)\nIn Section 3, we describe algorithms to solve our eigenvalue optimization problem in (7), as well as an algorithm from Chen and Ye (2008) that solves the different formulation in (8), for completeness."

      "text" : "Our explicit solution of the optimal kernel given in (5) is the projection of a penalized rank-one update to the indefinite kernel on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. As ρ tends to infinity, the rank-one update has less effect and in the limit, the optimal kernel is given by zeroing out the\nnegative eigenvalues of the indefinite kernel. This means that if the indefinite kernel contains a very small amount of noise, the best positive semidefinite kernel to use with SVM in our framework is the positive part of the indefinite kernel.\nThis limit as ρ tends to infinity also motivates a heuristic for transforming the kernel on the testing set. Since negative eigenvalues in the training kernel are thresholded to zero in the limit, the same transformation should occur for the test kernel. Hence, to measure generalization performance, we update the entries of the full kernel corresponding to training instances by the rank-one update resulting from the optimal solution to (7) and threshold the negative eigenvalues of the full kernel matrix to zero to produce a Mercer kernel on the test set."

We refer the reader to Kulis et al. (2006) for another kernel learning example using this method. Given the eigenvalue decomposition X = V DV T , by changing basis this problem can be reduced to the decomposition of the diagonal plus rank-one matrix, D+ρuuT , where u = V Tα. First, the updated eigenvalues are determined by solving the secular equations\ndet(D + ρuuT − λI) = 0,\nwhich can be done in O(n2). While there is an explicit solution for the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues, they are not stable because the eigenvalues are approximated. This instability is circumvented by computing a vector û such that approximate eigenvalues λ are the exact eigenvalues of the matrix D + ρûûT , then computing its stable eigenvectors explicitly, where both steps can be done in O(n2) time. The key is that D + ρûûT is close enough to our original matrix so that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are stable approximations of the true values. Finally, the eigenvectors of our original matrix are computed as VW , with W as the stable eigenvectors of D + ρûûT . Updating the eigenvalue decomposition is reduced to an O(n2) procedure plus one matrix multiplication, which is then the complexity of one gradient computation.\nWe note that eigenvalues of symmetric matrices are not differentiable when some of them have multiplicities greater than one (see Overton (1992) for a discussion), but a subgradient can be used instead of the gradient in all the algorithms detailed here. Lewis (1999) shows how to compute an approximate subdifferential of the k-th largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix.

The method is only efficient if the projection step is numerically cheap. The complexity of each iteration then breaks down as follows: Step 1. This requires an eigenvalue decomposition that is computed in O(n2) plus one matrix multiplication as described above. Experiments below use a stepsize of 5/k for IndefiniteSVM and 10/k for PerturbSVM (described in Section 4.3) where k is the iteration number.

Plugging in (16) into (15), the resulting formulation can be rewritten as the convex eigenvalue optimization problem\nmaximize αT y − ǫ|α| − 1 2\n∑\nimax(0, λi(K0 + αα T /(4ρ)))(αT vi) 2\n+ρ ∑ i (max(0, λi(K0 + αα T /4ρ)))2 −2ρ ∑\ni Tr((viv T i )K0)max(0, λi(K0 + αα T /(4ρ))) + ρTr(K0K0)\nsubject to αT e = 0,−C ≤ α ≤ C\n(17)\nin the variable α ∈ Rn. Again, a proxy kernel given by (16) can be produced from any feasible solution α ∈ Rn. Plugging the proxy kernel into problem (15) allows us to compute an upper bound on the optimum value of problem (15) by solving a support vector regression problem."

In this case, we learn another kernel that decreases the upper bound on generalization performance and produces perturbed support vectors. We can again interpret the input as a noisy kernel, and as such, one that will achieve suboptimal performance. If the input kernel is the best kernel to use (i.e. is not noisy), we will observe that our framework achieves optimal performance as ρ tends to infinity (through cross validation), otherwise we simply learn a better kernel using a finite ρ.\nWhen the similarity measure K0 is positive semidefinite, the proxy kernel K ∗ in Theorem 1\nsimplifies to a rank-one update of K0\nK∗ = K0 + (Y α ∗)(Y α∗)T /(4ρ) (21)\nwhereas, for indefiniteK0, the solution was to project this matrix on the cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

Since H is rank-one, the result follows from Theorem 3.2 of Higham (2002).\nNotice that Theorem 3 is a generalization of Theorem 1 where we had H = eeT . In constructing a rank-one penalty matrix H, we simply assign penalties to each training point. The componentwise penalty formulation can also be extended to true kernels.

      "heading" : "5.1 Generalization with indefinite kernels",
      "text" : "We compare our method for SVM classification with indefinite kernels to several kernel preprocessing techniques discussed earlier. The first three techniques perform spectral transformations on the indefinite kernel. The first, called denoise here, thresholds the negative eigenvalues to zero. The second transformation, called flip, takes the absolute value of all eigenvalues. The last transformation, shift, adds a constant to each eigenvalue, making them all positive. See Wu et al. (2005) for further details. We also implemented an SVM modification (denoted Mod SVM ) suggested in Lin and Lin (2003) where a nonconvex quadratic objective function is made convex by replacing the indefinite kernel with the identity matrix. The kernel only appears in linear inequality constraints that separate the data. Finally, we compare our results with a direct use of SVM classification on the original indefinite kernel (SVM converges but the solution is only a stationary point and not guaranteed to be optimal).\nWe first experiment on data from the USPS handwritten digits database Hull (1994) using the indefinite Simpson score and the one-sided tangent distance kernel to compare two digits. The tangent distance is a transformation invariant measure—it assigns high similarity between an image and slightly rotated or shifted instances—and is known to perform very well on this data set. Our experiments symmetrize the one-sided tangent distance using the square of the mean tangent distance defined in Haasdonk and Keysers (2002) and make it a similarity measure by negative exponentiation. We also consider the Simpson score for this task, which is much cheaper to compute (a ratio comparing binary pixels). We finally analyze three data sets (diabetes, german and ala) from the UCI repository (Asuncion and Newman 2007) using the indefinite sigmoid kernel.\nThe data is randomly divided into training and testing data. We apply 5-fold cross validation and use an average of the accuracy and recall measures (described below) to determine the optimal parameters C, ρ, and any kernel inputs. We then train a model with the full training set and optimal parameters and test on the independent test set.\nTable 1 provides summary statistics for these data sets, including the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the training similarity matrices. We observe that the Simpson are highly indefinite, while the one-sided tangent distance kernel is nearly positive semidefinite. The spectrum of sigmoid kernels varies greatly across examples because it is very sensitive to the sigmoid kernel parameters. Table 2 compares accuracy, recall, and their average for denoise, flip, shift, modified SVM, direct SVM and the indefinite SVM algorithm described in this work.\nBased on the interpretation from Section 2.3, Indefinite SVM should be expected to perform at least as well as denoise; if denoise were a good transformation, then cross-validation over ρ should choose a high penalty that makes Indefinite SVM and denoise nearly equivalent. The rank-one update provides more flexibility for the transformation and similarities concerning data points xi that are easily classified (αi = 0) are not modified by the rank-one update. Further interpretation for the specific rank-one update is not currently known. However, Chen et al. (2009) recently proposed spectrum modifications in a similar manner to Indefinite SVM. Rather than perturb the entire indefinite similarity matrix, they perturb the spectrum directly allowing improvements over the denoise as well as flip transformations. They also note that Indefinite SVMmight perform better on sparse kernels because the rank-one update may then allow inference of hidden relationships.\nWe observe that Indefinite SVM performs comparably on all USPS examples (slightly better for the highly indefinite Simpson kernels), which are relatively easy classification problems. As expected, classification using the tangent distance outperforms classification with the Simpson score but, as mentioned above, the Simpson score is cheaper to compute. We also note that other\ndocumented classification results on this USPS data set perform multi-classification, while here we only perform binary classification. Classification of the UCI data sets with sigmoid kernels is more difficult (as demonstrated by lower performance measures). Indefinite SVM here is the only technique that outperforms in at least one of the measures across all three data sets."

We also test these two techniques on positive semidefinite kernels formed using noisy USPS data sets (created by adding uniformly distributed noise in [-1,1] to each pixel before normalizing to [0,1]), in which case PerturbSVM can be seen as optimally denoised support vector machine classification. We again cross-validate on a training set and test on the same independent group of examples used in the experiments above. Optimal parameters from classification of unperturbed data were used to train classifiers for perturbed data. Results are summarized in Table 3.\nThese results show that PerturbSVM performs at least as well in almost all cases. As expected, noise decreased generalization performance in all experiments. Except in the USPS-4-6-gaussian example, the value of ρ selected was not the highest possible for each test where PerturbSVM outperforms SVM in at least one measure; this implies that the support vectors were perturbed to improve classification. Overall, when zero or moderate noise is present, PerturbSVM does improve performance over regular SVM as shown. When too much noise is present however (for example, pixel data with range in [-1,1] was modified with uniform noise in [-2,2] before being normalized to [0,1]), the performance of both techniques is comparable.\nTP+TN+FP+FN\n, Recall = TP\nTP+FN\n,\nand Average = (Accuracy + Recall)/2."

Average results and standard deviation are displayed in Figure 1 in semilog scale (note that the codes were not stopped here and that the target duality gap improvement is usually much smaller than 10−8). As expected, ACCPM converges much faster (in fact linearly) to a higher precision, while each iteration requires solving a linear program of size n. The gradient projection method converges faster in the beginning but stalls at higher precision, however each iteration only requires a rank one update on an eigenvalue decomposition.\nWe finally examine the computing time of IndefiniteSVM using the projected gradient method\nand ACCPM and compare them with the SIQCLP method of Chen and Ye (2008). Figure 2 shows total runtime (left) and average iteration runtime (right) for varying problem dimensions on an example from the USPS data with Simpson kernel. Experiments are averaged over 10 random data subsets and we fix C = 10 with a tolerance of .1 for the duality gap. For the projected gradient method, increasing ρ increases the number of iterations to converge; notice that the average time per iteration does not vary over ρ. SIQCLP also requires more iterations to converge for higher ρ, however the average iteration time seems to be less for higher ρ, so no clear pattern is seen when varying ρ. Note that the number of iterations required varies widely (between 100 and 2000 iterations in this experiment) as a function of ρ, C, the chosen kernel and the stepsize.\nResults for ACCPM and SIQCLP are shown only up to dimensions 500 and 300, respectively, because this sufficiently demonstrates that the projected gradient method is more efficient. ACCPM clearly suffers from the complexity of the analytic center problem each iteration. However, improvements can be made in the SIQCLP implementation such as using a regularized version of an efficient MKL solver (e.g. Rakotomamonjy et al. (2008)) to solve problem (13) rather than MOSEK. SIQCLP is also useful because it makes a connection between the indefinite SVM formulation and multiple kernel learning. We observed from experiments that the duality gap found from SIQCLP is tighter than the upper bound on the duality gap used for the projected gradient method. This could potentially be used to create a better stopping condition, however the complexity to derive the tighter duality gap (solving regularized MKL) is much higher than that to compute our current gap (solving a single SVM)."

Table 1 provides summary statistics for these data sets, including the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of the training similarity matrices. We observe that the Simpson are highly indefinite, while the one-sided tangent distance kernel is nearly positive semidefinite. The spectrum of sigmoid kernels varies greatly across examples because it is very sensitive to the sigmoid kernel parameters. Table 2 compares accuracy, recall, and their average for denoise, flip, shift, modified SVM, direct SVM and the indefinite SVM algorithm described in this work. Based on the interpretation from Section 2.3, Indefinite SVM should be expected to perform at least as well as denoise; if denoise were a good transformation, then cross-validation over ρ should choose a high penalty that makes Indefinite SVM and denoise nearly equivalent. The rank-one update provides more flexibility for the transformation and similarities concerning data points xi that are easily classified (αi = 0) are not modified by the rank-one update.

Experiments are averaged over 10 random data subsets and we fix C = 10 with a tolerance of .1 for the duality gap. For the projected gradient method, increasing ρ increases the number of iterations to converge; notice that the average time per iteration does not vary over ρ. SIQCLP also requires more iterations to converge for higher ρ, however the average iteration time seems to be less for higher ρ, so no clear pattern is seen when varying ρ. Note that the number of iterations required varies widely (between 100 and 2000 iterations in this experiment) as a function of ρ, C, the chosen kernel and the stepsize. Results for ACCPM and SIQCLP are shown only up to dimensions 500 and 300, respectively, because this sufficiently demonstrates that the projected gradient method is more efficient. ACCPM clearly suffers from the complexity of the analytic center problem each iteration. However, improvements can be made in the SIQCLP implementation such as using a regularized version of an efficient MKL solver (e.g. Rakotomamonjy et al. (2008)) to solve problem (13) rather than MOSEK.",

    "abstractText" : "We propose a method for support vector machine classification using indefinite kernels. Instead of directly minimizing or stabilizing a nonconvex loss function, our algorithm simultaneously computes support vectors and a proxy kernel matrix used in forming the loss. This can be interpreted as a penalized kernel learning problem where indefinite kernel matrices are treated as noisy observations of a true Mercer kernel. Our formulation keeps the problem convex and relatively large problems can be solved efficiently using the projected gradient or analytic center cutting plane methods. We compare the performance of our technique with other methods on several standard data sets.",
