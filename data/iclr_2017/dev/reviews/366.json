{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models", "abstract": "Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This is an interesting paper on a VAE framework for topic models.

The authors compare NVI-LDA to standard inference schemes such as CGS and online SVI. The authors also evaluate NVI on a different model ProdLDA (not sure this model has been proposed before in the topic modeling literature though?)\n\nIn general, I like the direction of this paper and NVI looks promising for LDA. The experimental results however confound model vs inference which makes it hard to understand the significance of the results. Furthermore, the authors don't discuss hyper-parameter selection which is known to significantly impact performance of topic models. This makes it hard to understand when the proposed method can be expected to work. \n\nCan you maybe generate synthetic datasets with different Dirichlet distributions and assess when the proposed method recovers the true parameters?\n\nFigure 1: Is this prior or posterior? The text talks about sparsity whereas the y-axis reads \"log p(topic proportions)\" which is a bit confusing.\n\nSection 3.2: it is not clear what you mean by unimodal in softmax basis. Consider a Dirichlet on K-dimensional simplex with concentration parameter alpha/K where alpha<1 makes it multimodal. Isn't the softmax basis still multimodal?\n\nNone of the numbers include error bars.

The paper shows a nice trick to approximate Dirichlet prior using softmax basis with a Gaussian and then the model is trained to maximize the variational lower bound.

The results look promising and the experimental protocol sounds fine.\n\nMinor comments:\nPlease add citation to [1] or [2] for neural variational inference, and [2] for VAE. \nA typo in \u201cThis approximation to the Dirichlet prior p(\u03b8|\u03b1) is results in the distribution\u201d, it should be \u201cThis approximation to the Dirichlet prior p(\u03b8|\u03b1) results in the distribution\u201d\n\nIn table 2, it is written that DMFVI was trained more than 24hrs but failed to deliver any result, but why not wait until the end and report the numbers?\n\nIn table 3, why are the perplexities of LDA-Collapsed Gibbs and NVDM are lower while the proposed models (ProdLDA) generates more coherent topics? What is your intuition on this?\n\nHow does the training speed (until the convergence) differs by using different learning-rate and momentum scheduling approaches shown as in figure 1?\n\nIt may be also interesting to add some more analysis on the latent variables z (component collapsing and etc., although your results indirectly show that the learning-rate and momentum scheduling trick removes this issue).\n\nOverall, the paper clearly proposes its main idea, explain why it is good to use NVI, and its experimental results support the original claim.
