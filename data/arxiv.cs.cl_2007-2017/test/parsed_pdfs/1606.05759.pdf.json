      "text" : "We describe the Egyptian Arabic-to-English statistical machine translation (SMT) system of the QCN team for the NIST OpenMT’2015 evaluation campaign. The QCN team included the Qatar Computing Research Institute, Columbia University, and New York University in Abu Dhabi.\nThe OpenMT 2015 translation task asked participants to build systems that can translate Egyptian Arabic from three different genres (SMS, chat, and speech) into English. The challenges presented by this multigenre task were many, ranging from scarcity of parallel data for training, to noisy source text and heterogeneity of the references. For example, large portions of the provided data consisted of romanized Egyptian Arabic (aka Arabizi) rather than using the Arabic script.\nTherefore, several preprocessing steps were needed in order to clean the data before building our SMT system. First, we converted all Arabizi to Arabic script; we then normalized it, trying to make it more like MSA. We also morphologically segmented long Arabic words using segmentation schemes that are standard for MSA but harder to do for dialectal Arabic. We used a statistical phrase-based MT system – Moses (Koehn et al., 2007). We experimented with different data processing schemes and different SMT system settings to achieve better translation quality. Here are the major settings: Egyptian Arabic segmentation (ATB, S2, D3), Egyptian Arabic to MSA conversion, sparse features, class-based models, neural network joint language model, hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration mining, domain adaptation, and data selection for tuning.\nIt is worth mentioning that given the abovementioned challenges, preprocessing by itself yielded the largest gains. The Egyptian Arabic segmentation gave us an improvement of up to 3 BLEU points. The hierarchically-interpolated language model added 1 extra BLEU point. The sparse features, class-based models, and neural network joint language models further improved translation quality by 0.66, 0.70 and 0.43 BLEU points absolute, respectively. In the next sections, we discuss in detail the different settings and decisions we made when preparing our submission.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the data preprocessing techniques and tools we tried, Section 3 explains in detail the non-standard features and components we tried in our SMT experiments, and Section 4 describes the actual system we submitted for the competition. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of the main points."

      "text" : "The NIST dataset contained text from three different genres: short text messages (SMS), chat (CHT), and transcribed conversational speech (CTS). We tackled each of the three genres separately, i.e., we built genre-specific systems. Furthermore, we split the provided training data for each genre into separate training and development sets by reserving approximately 3,000 sentences (the number of sentences is approximate as we did the splitting at the document level) from each set for development, and we used the rest for training.\nFor evaluation, the organizers provided two additional datasets: (i) an official devtest dataset (Test), and (ii) a small gold dataset (TestG), which is a subset of Test. The genres of the datasets were specified, and thus there was no need to train a system for automatic genre identification."

      "text" : "For training purposes, some datasets for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) were provided in addition to the Egyptian Arabic data (SMS, CHT, CTS) described above. These datasets consisted mostly of newswire text (i.e., a different genre), and thus we processed them using a standard MSA tool: MADAMIRA in MSA mode (Pasha et al., 2014). The MSA data was used to build a second phrase table to be then combined with some of the genrespecific phrase tables. We planned to match the same morphological tokenization schemes used for Egyptian Arabic, but at the end, we only used ATB segmentation for MSA. For more information on Arabic morphology challenges and tokenization schemes, see Habash (2010)."

The Arabic side of the SMS and CHT data had elongations and spelling mistakes. Therefore, we normalized the elongations and we standardized the spelling variations.\nParts of the SMS and CHT data contained romanized Arabic text (aka Arabizi), which is Arabic written using the Roman alphabet. In order to homogenize the input data, we converted the Arabizi into the standard Arabic script (utf8).\nGiven the conversational nature of SMS and chat, a further complication with converting romanized text into the Arabic script was that the text was usually affected by code-switching into English; therefore, it was important for us to identify the English words and not to try to convert them to Arabic. We solved these issues using the 3ARRIB tool (Al-Badrashiny et al., 2014).\nOn the English side of the data, there were multiple translation options, where typically the first option was the intended meaning and the second one the literal meaning of the Arabic text. We chose to use the intended meaning only.\nFinally, in all processing, for both Arabic and English, we made sure the emoticons were not affected by the tokenization or the translation."

      "heading" : "2.3 Egyptian Arabic Segmentation",
      "text" : "A major issue when training an SMT system for the present edition of the task is the small size of the provided SMS, CHT and CTS datasets, which means that data sparseness is a severe problem. One common way to reduce it, at least on the Arabic side, where it is more severe, is to segment the Arabic words into multiple tokens, e.g., by separating the main word from the attached conjunctions, pronouns, articles, etc. Since these are separate words in English, such a segmentation not only reduces sparseness, but also yields improved word mapping to English, thus ultimately helping word alignments and translation model estimation for SMT. The value of Arabic tokenization for SMT, especially under low resource conditions, has been demonstrated by a number of researchers in the past, e.g., (Badr et al., 2008; El Kholy and Habash, 2012; Habash et al., 2013; Al-Mannai et al., 2014).\nWe experimented with common segmen-\ntation schemes such as D3, S2 and ATB (Badr et al., 2008; Habash, 2010). For tokenization, we used MADAMIRA (Pasha et al., 2014), a fast and efficient implementation of MADA for MSA (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Habash et al., 2009), and MADA-ARZ, a version of MADA for Egyptian Arabic (Habash et al., 2013). Table 1 compares the results of using different segmentation schemes including no segmentation. We see gains of up to 3 BLEU points absolute on Test when using segmentation compared to no segmentation. However, the differences between the various schemes (ATB, S2 and D3) are small."

      "heading" : "2.4 Egyptian to MSA Conversion",
      "text" : "Another way to reduce data sparseness is by using additional out-of-domain data, e.g., newswire; this means a double domain shift: (i) from an informal text genre to newswire, and also (ii) from dialectal Arabic to MSA. While it is hard to do anything about the domain shift, the dialectal shift is somewhat easier to address. Changes between dialects are often systematic and many of the differences are at the level of individual words.\nPrevious work has shown that converting Egyptian to MSA makes it easier to use MSA resources for translating dialectal Arabic (Mohamed et al., 2012; Salloum and Habash, 2011; Zbib et al., 2012; Salloum and Habash, 2013; Sajjad et al., 2013a; Durrani et al., 2014a). So, we experimented with converting Egyptian to MSA using an inhouse tool (Sajjad et al., 2013a), which performs character-level transformations for each Egyptian word in isolation to generate an MSA version thereof. We then trained an SMT system on this converted data.\nThe results are shown in Table 2. We can see that converting Egyptian to MSA yields improvements that are systematic across the three genres and also across the two test datasets. However, this improvement is not very large and ranges from 0.18 to 0.70 BLEU points absolute.\nFurther segmenting the MSA-like Egyptian using MADA ATB yielded very mixed results: in some cases, it added 0.93 BLEU points absolute, but in other there was a drop of 0.76. This could be because of the highly dialectal nature of the NIST data, which differs from MSA in lexical choice, which our tool cannot handle. Our Egyptian to MSA tool works at the character level and converts to MSA only those Egyptian words that are different at the character level.\nIn general, full conversion of dialectal Arabic to MSA would require not only word-level transformations but also phrase-level ones (Wang et al., 2012), while taking context into account (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012), and also modeling morphological phenomena (Nakov and Ng, 2011). There are also potential gains from a smarter character alignment models (Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013), or even from using a specialized decoder (Wang and Ng, 2013). Ultimately, the real benefit is when combining the adapted version of the smaller dialect with a large dataset in the bigger dialect (Nakov and Ng, 2012), which we will do below."

      "heading" : "3 Translation System Characteristics",
      "text" : "We started our experiments from a strong baseline system, which was originally designed for MSA to English translation (Sajjad et al., 2013b). We then extended it with some additional models and features (Durrani et al., 2014b). Most notably, we used minimum Bayes risk decoding (MBR) (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), monotone-at-punctuation reordering, dropping of out-of-vocabulary words, operation sequence model for reordering (OSM) (Durrani et al., 2011; Durrani et al., 2013b), a smoothed BLEU+1 version of PRO for parameter tuning (Nakov et al., 2012), etc.\nGiven this baseline system, we experimented with several further extensions, which we will describe below. Some of them were eventually included in our final submission."

      "text" : "First, we experimented with building a hierarchically-interpolated language model for each genre (i.e., CTS, SMS, and CHT). We tuned each model to minimize the perplexity on a held-out set for that target genre.\nWe examined the text resources that were available for training an English language model, and we split them into six groups: (1) Egyptian-source (the target sides of the CTS, CHT and CTS training bi-texts), (2) MSA GALE News (GALE P3 {R1,R2},P4{R1,2,3}), (3) Chinese GALE (GALE P2 {BC,BC,BL,NG}), (4) MSA NEWS (newsetirr, news-par, news-trans, ISI), (5) MSA GALE non-news (GALE P1 {BLOG} P2 {BC1, BC2, WEB}), and (6) Gigaword v5, split into four subgroups by year (Guzmán et al., 2012) (1994-1997, 1998-2001, 2002-2005, 2006-2010).\nFor each such group, (i) we built an individual 5-gram language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing for each member of the group, and (ii) we interpolated these language models into a single language model, minimizing the perplexity for the target genre. Then, (iii) we performed a second (hierarchical) interpolation, this time combining the resulting six group language models, again minimizing the perplexity for the target genre. We used the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to build the language models.\nTable 4 shows the results of using interpolated language model for each domain in comparison with using a language model built on the concatenation of the English side of the SMS, CHT and CTS corpora. The interpolated language model consistently improved all genres with a maximum\nimprovement of up to 1 BLEU points on Test."

      "heading" : "3.2 Translation Model with Sparse Features",
      "text" : "The next thing we experimented with were sparse features (Chiang et al., 2009), which are a recent addition to the Moses SMT toolkit. In particular, we used target and source word insertion features: (i) top 50, and (ii) all. The latter worked better, and thus we only show results for it.\nThe results for all are shown in Table 5, where we can see that sparse features only helped for CHT, while they were harmful for CTS, and yielded mixed results for SMS. Thus, in our final system, we only used them for CHT."

We also experimented with OSM models (Durrani et al., 2013a) over cluster IDs (Durrani et al., 2014c; Bisazza and Monz, 2014). Normally, the lexically-driven OSM model falls back to context sizes of 2-3 operations due to data sparseness, but learning operation sequences over cluster IDs enabled us to learn richer translation and reordering patterns that can generalize better in sparse conditions.\nTable 6 shows the experimental results when adding a target language model and an OSM model over cluster IDs. We can see that these class-based models yielded consistent improvements in all cases. We also tried using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) for clustering, but the results did not improve any further and they were occasionally worse than those with mkcls. We tried\nboth with 50 and 500 classes, but using additional classes did not help."

      "heading" : "3.4 Unsupervised Transliteration Models",
      "text" : "A consequence of data sparseness is that at test time, the SMT system would see many unknown or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. One way to cope with them is to just pass them through untranslated. This works somewhat fine with newswire text and for languages with (roughly) the same alphabet, e.g., English and Spanish, as many OOVs are likely to be named entities (persons, locations, organizations), and are thus likely to be preserved in translation.\nHowever, for languages with different scripts, such as Arabic and English, passing through is not a good idea, especially when translating into English as words in Arabic script do not naturally appear in English. In that case, it is much safer just to drop the OOVs, which is best done at decoding time; this was indeed our baseline strategy.\nA better way is to transliterate OOV words either during decoding or in a post-processing step (Sajjad et al., 2013c). We also experimented with this approach. For this purpose, we built an unsupervised transliteration model (Durrani et al., 2014d) based on EM as proposed in (Sajjad et al., 2011). Unfortunately, it did not help much, probably because in these informal genres the OOVs are rarely named entities; they are real words, which need actual translation, not transliteration."

Major performance gains have already been demonstrated for speech recognition, and there have been successful applications to semantics.\nMost importantly for us, last year, very sizable performance gains were also reported for SMT using a neural joint language model or NNJM (Devlin et al., 2014).\nWe tried the Moses implementation of JNLM using the settings described in (Birch et al., 2014). While we managed to achieve consistent improvements for all three genres and for both test sets, as Table 7 shows, these gains are modest, 0.04–0.57 BLEU points absolute, which is far from what was reported in (Devlin et al., 2014). It is unclear what the reasons are, but it could have to do with the small size of our training bitexts and the informal genres we are dealing with."

Next, we experimented with building separate phrase tables, one in-domain and one out-of-domain, and then (a) using phrase table backoff, or (b) merging phrase tables and reordering tables as in (Nakov, 2008; Nakov and Ng, 2009; Sajjad et al., 2013b).\nThe results of our domain adaptation experiments when testing on SMS as the target genre are shown in Table 8. Note that the results on Test and on TestG differ a lot, and thus we focus on Test as it is much larger. We can see that the best way to combine SMS, CHT and CTS is simply to concatenate them, which yields +2.5 BLEU points of improvement absolute over training on SMS data only. Further small gains can be achieved by\nmerging the resulting SMS+CHT+CTS phrase table with a phrase table trained on MSA, where the two tables are merged using extra indicator features as described in (Nakov, 2008)."

      "heading" : "3.7 Tuning",
      "text" : "Our phrase-based SMT system combines different features in a log-linear model. We tune the weights for the individual features of that model by optimizing BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) on a tuning dataset from the same genre as that in the test. We use PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011), but with smoothed BLEU+1 as proposed in (Nakov et al., 2012). We allowed the optimizer to run for up to 25 iterations, and to extract 1000-best lists on each iteration.\nThe choice of tuning set has been shown to have a huge impact on the quality of the learned parameters (Nakov et al., 2013a). In particular, PRO is very sensitive to length, which can result in pathological translations in some circumstances (Nakov et al., 2013b).\nGiven that there were no official development sets for this year, we synthesized datasets that are specific for CTS and SMS, based on sentencelength as a selection criterion.1 This is crucial to remove potentially noisy data. It can also help to speed up the tuning process.\nIn order to achieve this, we filtered all sentence\n1The CHT sentences were generally of reasonable length, and thus we did not apply filtering for them.\npairs for which either the source or the target sentences were shorter than 4 words or longer than 25 words. The cut-offs were determined empirically by analyzing the kernel density estimations (KDE α = 0.3).\nTable 9 compares tuning on an unfiltered and on a filtered tuning set. For SMS, using a filtered tuning set yields mixed results: we see a drop in BLEU on Test and a gain on TestG. For CTS, filtering helped both on Test and on TextG, with a gain on the former of +0.63."

For this purpose, we used the Multi-Engine MT system, or MEMT, (Heafield et al., 2009), which has been proven effective in such a setup and has contributed to achieving state-of-the-art results in a related competition in the past (Sajjad et al., 2013b).\nThe results are shown in Table 10. We can see that using output combination yields notable improvement for SMS and CHT. However, for CTS, BLEU dropped by 0.45 points on Test. Thus, we submitted as a primary system the output combination for SMS and CHT, but our best individual system for CTS (which uses D3 segmentation)."

The system was ranked second in the competition on all three genres: SMS, chat, and speech.\nGiven the informal dialectal nature of these genres, we benefited from careful pre-processing, cleaning, and normalization, which yielded an improvement of up to 3 BLEU points over a strong baseline.\nWe further added a number of extra advanced features, which yielded 2.5 more BLEU points of absolute improvement on top of that due to pre-processing. In particular, sparse features contributed 0.7 BLEU points for CHT, class-based models added 0.7 and 0.6 BLEU points for CHT and SMS, respectively, and NNJM yielded gains of up to 0.4 BLEU points absolute."

Thus, our efforts focused on processing and standardizing Arabic, e.g., using tools such as 3arrib and MADAMIRA. We further trained a phrase-based SMT system using state-of-the-art features and components such as operation sequence model, class-based language model, sparse features, neural network joint model, genrebased hierarchically-interpolated language model, unsupervised transliteration mining, phrase-table merging, and hypothesis combination. Our system ranked second on all three genres.",
