      "text" : "In undirected graphical models or Markov random fields, each node represents a random variable while the set of edges specifies the conditional independencies of the underlying distribution. When the random variables are jointly Gaussian, the models are called Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) or Gauss Markov random fields. GGMs, such as linear state space models, Bayesian linear regression models, and thin-membrane/thin-plate models, have been widely used in communication, image processing, medical diagnostics, and gene regulatory networks. In general, a larger family of graphs represent a larger collection of distributions and thus can better approximate arbitrary empirical distributions. However, many graphs lead to computationally expensive inference and learning algorithms. Hence, it is important to study the trade-off between modeling capacity and efficiency.\nBoth inference and learning are efficient for tree-structured graphs (graphs without cycles): inference can be computed exactly in linear time (with respect to the size of the graph) using belief propagation (BP) [1] while the learning problem can be solved exactly in quadratic time using the Chow-Liu algorithm [2]. Since trees have limited modeling capacity, many models beyond trees have been proposed [3, 4, 5, 6]. Thin junction trees (graphs with low tree-width) are extensions of trees, where inference can be solved efficiently using the junction algorithm [7]. However, learning\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n22 41\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 0\nN ov\njunction trees with tree-width greater than one is NP-complete [6] and tractable learning algorithms (e.g. [8]) often have constraints on both the tree-width and the maximum degree. Since graphs with large-degree nodes are important in modeling applications such as social networks, flight networks, and robotic localization, we are interested in finding a family of models that allow arbitrarily large degrees while being tractable for learning.\nBeyond thin-junction trees, the family of sparse GGMs is also widely studied [9, 10]. These models are often estimated using methods such as graphical lasso (or l-1 regularization) [11, 12]. However, a sparse GGM (e.g. a grid) does not automatically lead to efficient algorithms for exact inference. Hence, we are interested in finding a family of models that are not only sparse but also have guaranteed efficient inference algorithms.\nIn this paper, we study the family of GGMs with small feedback vertex sets (FVSs), where an FVS is a set of nodes whose removal breaks all cycles [13]. The authors of [14] have demonstrated that the computation of exact means and variances for such a GGM can be accomplished, using message-passing algorithms with complexity O(k2n), where k is the size of the FVS and n is the total number of nodes. They have also presented results showing that for models with larger FVSs, approximate inference (obtained by replacing a full FVS by a pseudo-FVS) can work very well, with empirical evidence indicating that a pseudo-FVS of size O(log n) gives excellent results. In Appendix A we will provide some additional analysis of inference for such models (including the computation of the partition function), but the main focus is maximum likelihood (ML) learning of models with FVSs of modest size, including identifying the nodes to include in the FVS.\nIn particular, we investigate two cases. In the first, all of the variables, including any to be included in the FVS are observed. We provide an algorithm for exact ML estimation that, regardless of the maximum degree, has complexityO(kn2 +n2 log n) if the FVS nodes are identified in advance and polynomial complexity if the FVS is to be learned and of bounded size. Moreover, we provide an approximate and much faster greedy algorithm when the FVS is unknown and large. In the second case, the FVS nodes are taken to be latent variables. In this case, the structure learning problem corresponds to the (exact or approximate) decomposition of an inverse covariance matrix into the sum of a tree-structured matrix and a low-rank matrix. We propose an algorithm that iterates between two projections, which can also be interpreted as alternating low-rank corrections. We prove that even though the second projection is onto a highly non-convex set, it is carried out exactly, thanks to the properties of GGMs of this family. By carefully incorporating efficient inference into the learning steps, we can further reduce the complexity to O(kn2 + n2 log n) per iteration. We also perform experiments using both synthetic data and real data of flight delays to demonstrate the modeling capacity with FVSs of various sizes. We show that empirically the family of GGMs of size O(log n) strikes a good balance between the modeling capacity and efficiency. Related Work In the context of classification, the authors of [15] have proposed the tree augmented naive Bayesian model, where the class label variable itself can be viewed as a size-one observed FVS; however, this model does not naturally extend to include a larger FVS. In [16], a convex optimization framework is proposed to learn GGMs with latent variables, where conditioned on a small number of latent variables, the remaining nodes induce a sparse graph. In our setting with latent FVSs, we further require the sparse subgraph to have tree structure."

      "text" : "Each undirected graphical model has an underlying graph G = (V, E), where V denotes the set of vertices (nodes) and E the set of edges. Each node s ∈ V corresponds to a random variable xs. When the random vector xV is jointly Gaussian, the model is a GGM with density function given by p(x) = 1Z exp{− 1 2x\nTJx + hTx}, where J is the information matrix or precision matrix, h is the potential vector, and Z is the partition function. The parameters J and h are related to the mean µ and covariance matrix Σ by µ = J−1h and Σ = J−1. The structure of the underlying graph is revealed by the sparsity pattern of J : there is an edge between i and j if and only if Jij 6= 0.\nGiven samples {xi}si=1 independently generated from an unknown distribution q in the family Q, the ML estimate is defined as qML = arg minq∈Q ∑s i=1 log q(x\ni). For Gaussian distributions, the empirical distribution is p̂(x) = N (x; µ̂, Σ̂), where the empirical mean µ̂ = 1s ∑s i=1 x i and the\nempirical covariance matrix Σ̂ = 1s ∑s i=1 x i ( xi )T − µ̂µ̂T . The Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence\nbetween two distributions p and q is defined as DKL(p||q) = ´ p(x) log p(x)q(x) dx. Without loss of generality, we assume in this paper the means are zero.\nTree-structured models are models whose underlying graphs do not have cycles. The ML estimate of a tree-structured model can be computed exactly using the Chow-Liu algorithm [2]. We use ΣCL = CL(Σ̂) and ECL = CLE(Σ̂) to denote respectively the covariance matrix and the set of edges learned using the Chow-Liu algorithm where the samples have empirical covariance matrix Σ̂."

      "text" : "In this section we briefly discuss some of the ideas related to GGMs with FVSs of size k, where we will also refer to the nodes in the FVS as feedback nodes. An example of a graph and its FVS is given in Figure 1, where the full graph (Figure 1a) becomes a cycle-free graph (Figure 1b) if nodes 1 and 2 are removed, and thus the set {1, 2} is an FVS.\n.\n1\n1\nGraphs with small FVSs have been studied in various contexts. The authors of [17] have characterized the family of graphs with small FVSs and their obstruction sets (sets of forbidden minors). FVSs are also related to the “stable sets” in the study of tournaments [18].\nGiven a GGM with an FVS of size k (where the FVS may or may not be given), the marginal means and variances µi = ( J−1h ) i and Σii = ( J−1 ) ii\n, for ∀i ∈ V can be computed exactly with complexity O(k2n) using the feedback message passing (FMP) algorithm proposed in [14], where standard BP is employed two times on the cycle-free subgraph among the non-feedback nodes while a special message-passing protocol is used for the FVS nodes. We provide a new algorithm in Appendix D, to compute det J , the determinant of J , and hence the partition function of such a model with complexity O(k2n). The algorithm is described and proved in Appendix A. An important point to note is that the complexity of these algorithms depends simply on the size k and the number of nodes n. There is no loss in generality in assuming that the size-k FVS F is fully connected and each of the feedback nodes has edges to every non-feedback node. In particular, after re-ordering the nodes so that the elements of F are the first k nodes (T = V \\F is the set of non-\nfeedback nodes of size n− k), we have that J = [ JF J T M\nJM JT\n] 0, where JT 0 corresponds to\na tree-structured subgraph among the non-feedback nodes, JF 0 corresponds to a complete graph among the feedback nodes, and all entries of JM may be non-zero as long as JT − JMJ−1F JTM 0 (while Σ = [ ΣF Σ T M\nΣM JT\n] = J−1 0 ). We will refer to the family of such models with a given\nFVS F as QF , and the class of models with some FVS of size at most k as Qk.1 If we are not explicitly given an FVS, though the problem of finding an FVS of minimal size is NP-complete, the authors of [19] have proposed an efficient algorithm with complexity O(min{m log n, n2}), where m is the number of edges, that yields an FVS at most twice the minimum size (thus the inference complexity is increased only by a constant factor). However, the main focus of this paper, explored in the next section, is on learning models with small FVSs (so that when learned, the FVS is known). As we will see, the complexity of such algorithms is manageable. Moreover, as our experiments will demonstrate, for many problems, quite modestly sized FVSs suffice."

(1)\nThis optimization problem is defined on a highly non-convex set QF with combinatorial structures: indeed, there are (n − k)n−k−2 possible spanning trees among the subgraph induced by the nonfeedback nodes. However, we are able to solve Problem (1) exactly using the conditioned Chow-Liu algorithm described in Algorithm 1.2 The intuition behind this algorithm is that even though the entire graph is not tree, the subgraph induced by the non-feedback nodes (which corresponds to the distribution of the non-feedback nodes conditioned on the feedback nodes) has tree structure, and thus we can find the best tree among the non-feedback nodes using the Chow-Liu algorithm applied on the conditional distribution. To obtain a concise expression, we also exploit a property of Gaussian distributions: the conditional information matrix (the information matrix of the conditional distribution) is simply a submatrix of the whole information matrix. In Step 1 of Algorithm 1, we compute the conditional covariance matrix using the Schur complement, and then in Step 2 we use the Chow-Liu algorithm to obtain the best approximate ΣCL (whose inverse is tree-structured). In Step 3, we match exactly the covariance matrix among the feedback nodes and the covariance matrix between the feedback nodes and the non-feedback nodes. For the covariance matrix among the non-feedback nodes, we add the matrix subtracted in Step 1 back to ΣCL. Proposition 1 states the correctness and the complexity of Algorithm 1.

In this subsection, we present both exact and approximate algorithms for learning models with FVS of size no larger than k (i.e., in Qk).

However, as our empirical results suggest, choosing k = O(log(n)) works well, leading to quasi-polynomial complexity even for this exact algorithm. That observation notwithstanding, the following greedy algorithm (Algorithm 2), which, at each iteration, selects the single best node to add to the current set of feedback nodes, has polynomial complexity for arbitrarily large FVSs.

The general form of the algorithm is as follows:\n1. Project onto the empirical distribution:\np̂(t)(xF ,xT ) = p̂(xT )q (t)(xF |xT ).\n2. Project onto the best fitting structure on all variables:\nq(t+1)(xF ,xT ) = arg min q(xF ,xT )∈QF DKL(p̂ (t)(xF ,xT )||q(xF ,xT )).\nIn the first projection, we obtain a distribution (on both observed and latent variables) whose marginal (on the observed variables) matches exactly the empirical distribution while maintaining the conditional distribution (of the latent variables given the observed ones). In the second projection we compute a distribution (on all variables) in the family considered that is the closest to the distribution obtained in the first projection. We found that among various EM type algorithms, this formulation is the most revealing for our problems because it clearly relates the second projection to the scenario where an FVS F is both observed and known (Section 4.1.1). Therefore, we are able to compute the second projection exactly even though the graph structure is unknown (which allows any tree structure among the observed nodes).

In projection P1, three blocks of the information matrix remain the same; In projection P2, three blocks of the covariance matrix remain the same.\nThe two projections in Algorithm 3 can also be interpreted as alternating low-rank corrections : indeed,\nIn P1 Ĵ (t) =\n[ 0 0\n0 (\nΣ̂T )−1 ]+ [ J (t)F J\n(t) M\n]( J\n(t) F )−1 [ J (t) F ( J (t) M )T ] ,\nand in P2 Σ(t+1) = [ 0 0\n0 CL(Σ̂T |F )\n] + [ Σ̂ (t) F\nΣ̂ (t) M\n]( Σ̂\n(t) F )−1 [ Σ̂ (t) F ( Σ̂ (t) M )T ] ,\nwhere the second terms of both expressions are of low-rank when the size of the latent FVS is small. This formulation is the most intuitive and simple, but a naive implementation of Algorithm 3 has complexity O(n3) per iteration, where the bottleneck is inverting full matrices Ĵ (t) and Σ(t+1). By carefully incorporating the inference algorithms into the projection steps, we are able to further exploit the power of the models and reduce the per-iteration complexity toO(kn2+n2 log n), which is the same as the complexity of the conditioned Chow-Liu algorithm alone. We have the following proposition. Proposition 2. Using Algorithm 3, the objective function of (3) decreases with the number of iterations, i.e., DKL(N (0, Σ̂T )||N (0,Σ(t+1)T )) ≤ N (0, Σ̂T )||N (0,Σ (t) T )). Using an accelerated version of Algorithm 3, the complexity per iteration is O(kn2 + n2 log n).\nDue to the page limit, we defer the description of the accelerated version (the accelerated latent Chow-Liu algorithm) and the proof of Proposition 2 to Appendix C. In fact, we never need to explicitly invert the empirical covariance matrix Σ̂T in the accelerated version.\nAs a rule of thumb, we often use the spanning tree obtained by the standard Chow-Liu algorithm as an initial tree among the observed nodes. But note that P2 involves solving a combinatorial problem exactly, so the algorithm is able to jump among different graph structures which reduces the chance\nof getting stuck at a bad local minimum and gives us much more flexibility in initializing graph structures. In the experiments, we will demonstrate that Algorithm 3 is not sensitive to the initial graph structure."

      "text" : "In this section, we present experimental results for learning GGMs with small FVSs, observed or latent, using both synthetic data and real data of flight delays. Fractional Brownian Motion: Latent FVS We consider a fractional Brownian motion (fBM) with Hurst parameter H = 0.2 defined on the time interval (0, 1]. The covariance function is Σ(t1, t2) = 1 2 (|t1|\n2H + |t2|2H − |t1 − t2|2H). Figure 2 shows the covariance matrices of approximate models using spanning trees (learned by the Chow-Liu algorithm), latent trees (learned by the CLRG and NJ algorithms in [21]) and our latent FVS model (learned by Algorithm 3) using 64 time samples (nodes). We can see that in the spanning tree the correlation decays quickly (in fact exponentially) with distance, which models the fBM poorly. The latent trees that are learned exhibit blocky artifacts and have little or no improvement over the spanning tree measured in the K-L divergence. In Figure 3, we plot the K-L divergence (between the true model and the learned models using Algorithm 3) versus the size of the latent FVSs for models with 32, 64, 128, and 256 time samples respectively. For these models, we need about 1, 3, 5, and 7 feedback nodes respectively to reduce the K-L divergence to 25% of that achieved by the best spanning tree model. Hence, we speculate that empirically k = O(log n) is a proper choice of the size of the latent FVS. We also study the sensitivity of Algorithm 3 to the initial graph structure. In our experiments, for different initial structures, Algorithm 3 converges to the same graph structures (that give the K-L divergence as shown in Figure 3) within three iterations. Performance of the Greedy Algorithm: Observed FVS In this experiment, we examine the performance of the greedy algorithm (Algorithm 2) when the FVS nodes are observed. For each run, we construct a GGM that has 20 nodes and an FVS of size three as the true model. We first generate a random spanning tree among the non-feedback nodes. Then the corresponding information matrix J is also randomly generated: non-zero entries of J are drawn i.i.d. from the uniform distribution U [−1, 1] with a multiple of the identity matrix added to ensure J 0. From each generated GGM, we draw 1000 samples and use Algorithm 2 to learn the model. For 100 runs that we have performed, we recover the true graph structures successfully. Figure 4 shows the graphs (and the K-L divergence) obtained using the greedy algorithm for a typical run. We can see that we have the most divergence reduction (from 12.7651 to 1.3832) when the first feedback node is selected. When the size of the FVS increases to three (Figure 4e), the graph structure is recovered correctly.\nFlight Delay Model: Observed FVS In this experiment, we model the relationships among airports for flight delays. The raw dataset comes from RITA of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. It contains flight information in the U.S. from 1987 to 2008 including information such as scheduled departure time, scheduled arrival time, departure delay, arrival delay, cancellation, and reasons for cancellation for all domestic flights in the U.S. We want to model how the flight delays at different airports are related to each other using GGMs. First, we compute the average departure delay for each day and each airport (of the top 200 busiest airports) using data from the year 2008. Note that the average departure delays does not directly indicate whether an airport is one of the major airports that has heavy traffic. It is interesting to see whether major airports (especially those notorious for delays) correspond to feedback nodes in the learned models. Figure 5a shows the best tree-structured graph obtained by the Chow-Liu algorithms (with input being the covariance matrix of the average delay). Figure 5b–5d show the GGMs learned using Algorithm 2. It is interesting that the first node selected is Nashville (BNA), which is not one of the top “hubs” of the air system. The reason is that much of the statistical relationships related to those hubs are approximated well enough, when we consider a 1-FVS approximation, by a spanning tree (excluding BNA) and it is the breaking of the cycles involving BNA that provide the most reduction in K-L divergence over a spanning tree. Starting with the next node selected in our greedy algorithm, we begin to see hubs being chosen. In particular, the first ten airports selected in order are: BNA, Chicago, Atlanta, Oakland, Newark, Dallas, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC, Salt Lake City. Several major airports on the coasts (e.g., Los Angeles and JFK) are not selected, as their influence on delays at other domestic airports is well-captured with a tree structure."

From Step 3, we can get ĴF = JF − [ g1 g2 · · · gk ]T JT [ g1 g2 · · · gk ] = JF − ( J−1T JM )T JT ( J−1T JM\n) = JF − JTMJ−1T JM .

(10)\nHence, we have proved the correctness of the algorithm. Now we calculate the complexity. The first step of Algorithm 4 has complexity O(n − k) using BP. Step 2 takes O ( k2(n− k) ) and the\ncomplexity of Step 3 is O(k3). Finally the complexity of Step 4 is O(n) since T is a tree. The total complexity is thus O(k2n). This completes the proof for Proposition3.\nNote that if the FVS is not given, we can use the factor-2 approximate algorithm in [19] to obtain an FVS of size at most twice the minimum size with complexity O(min{m log n, n2}), where m is the number of edges."

      "text" : "B.1 Preliminaries\nProposition 1 states that Algorithm 1 computes the ML estimate with covariance ΣML (together with EML, the set of edges among the non-feedback nodes) exactly with complexity O(kn2 + n2 log n), and that JML ∆ = Σ−1ML can be computed with additional complexity O(k2n).\nFirst, we define the following information quantities:\n1. The entropy Hpx(x) = − ´ x px(x) log px(x)dx\n2. The conditional entropy Hpx,y(x|y) = − ´ x,y px,y(x,y) log px|y(x|y)dxdy 3. The mutual information Ipx,y(x;y) = ´ x,y px,y(x,y) log p(x)p(y) p(x,y) dxdy\n4. The conditional mutual information\nIpx,y,z(x;y|z) = ˆ x,y,z px,y,z(x,y, z) log p(x,y|z) p(x|z)p(y|z) dxdy\n5. The conditional K-L divergence: D(p̂x|y||qx|y|p̂y) ∆ = D(p̂x,y||qx|yp̂y).\nThe (conditional) K-L divergence is always nonnegative. It is zero if and only if the two distributions are the same (almost everywhere). When there is no confusion, the subscripts in the distributions are often omitted, e.g., Ipx,y(x;y) written as Ip(x;y). With a slight abuse of notation, l we use p(xF ) to denote the marginal distribution of xF under the joint distribution p(x), and similarly p(xT |xF ) to denote the conditional distribution of xT given xF under the joint distribution p(x).\nThe standard Chow-Liu Algorithm for GGMs is summarized in 5. The complexity is O(n2 log n). Note that in Step 3, for a fixed i, for any (i, j) /∈ ET , Σij can be computed following a topological order of with i being the root. Hence, by book-keeping the computed products along the paths, the complexity of computing each Σij is O(1).\nAlgorithm 5 the Chow-Liu Algorithm for GGMs Input: the empirical covariance matrix Σ̂ Output: ΣCL and ECL\n1. Compute the correlation coefficients ρij = Σ̂ij√ Σ̂iiΣ̂jj\n2. Find an MST (maximum weight spanning tree) of the complete graph with weights |ρij | for edge (i, j). The edge set of the tree is denoted as ET .\n3. For all i ∈ V, (ΣCL)ii = Σ̂ii; for (i, j) ∈ ET , (ΣCL)ij = Σ̂ij ; for (i, j) /∈ ET , (ΣCL)ij = √ ΣiiΣjj ∏ (l,k)∈Path(i,j) ρlk, where Path(i, j) is the set of edges on the unique\npath between i and j in the spanning tree.\nB.2 Lemmas\nLemma 2 is a well-known result stated without proof. Lemma 2. The p.d.f. of a tree-structured model T = (V, E) can be factorized according to either of the following two equations:\n1. p(x) = p(xr) ∏ i∈V\\r p(xi|xπ(i)), where r is an arbitrary node selected as the root and\nπ(i) is the unique parent of node i in the tree rooted at r.\n2. p(x) = ∏ i∈V p(xi) ∏ (i,j)∈E p(xi,xj) p(xi)p(xj) .\nFor a given F and a fixed tree T with edge set ET among the non-feedback nodes, Lemma 3 gives a closed form solution that minimizes the K-L divergence.\nLemma 3.\nmin q∈QF,T DKL(p̂||q) = −Hp̂(x) +Hp̂(xF ) + ∑ i∈V\\F Hp̂(xi|xF )− ∑ (i,j)∈ET Ip̂(xi;xj |xF ), (11)\nwhere QF,T is the set of distributions defined on a graph with a given FVS F and a given spanning tree T among the non-feedback nodes. The minimum K-L divergence is obtained if and only if: 1) q(xF ) = p̂(xF ); 2) q(xF , xi, xj) = p̂(xF , xi, xj) for any (i, j) ∈ ET .\nProof. With fixed F and T ,\nDKL(p̂||q) = ˆ p̂(x) log p̂(x)\nq(x) dx\n= −Hp̂(x)− ˆ p̂(x) log q(x)dx = −Hp̂(x)− ˆ p̂(x) log (q(xF )q(xT |xF )) dx\n(a) = −Hp̂(x)− ˆ p̂(x) log q(xF )q(xr|xF ) ∏ i∈V\\F\\r q(xi|xF ,xπ(i))  dx = −Hp̂(x)− ˆ p̂(xF ) log q(xF )dxF − ˆ p̂(xF ,xr) log q(xr|xF )dxFdxr\n− ∑\ni∈V\\F\\r\nˆ p̂(xF ,xπ(i),xi) log q(xi|xF ,xπ(i))dxFdxπ(i)dxi\n(b) = −Hp̂(x) +Hp̂(xF ) +D(p̂F ||qF ) +Hp̂(xr|xF ) +D(p̂r|F ||qr|F |p̂F ) + ∑\ni∈V \\F\\r\nHp̂(xi|xF,π(i)) +D(p̂i|F,r||qi|F,r|p̂F,r)\n(c) ≥ −Hp̂(x) +Hp̂(xF ) +Hp̂(xr|xF ) + ∑\ni∈V \\F\\r\nHp̂(xi|xF,π(i)), (12)\nwhere (a) is obtained by using Factorization 1 in Lemma 2 with an arbitrary root node r; (b) can be directly verified using the definition of the information quantities, and the equality in (c) is satisfied when qF = p̂F , qr|F = p̂r|F , and qi|F,π(i) = p̂i|F,π(i),∀i ∈ T\\r, or equivalently when\nqF = p̂F\nqF,i,j = p̂F,i,j ,∀(i, j) ∈ ET . (13)\nNext, we derive another expression of (12). By substituting (13) into Factorization s of Lemma 2, we have\nq∗(x) = p̂(xF ) ∏ i∈T p̂(xi|xF ) ∏\n(i,j)∈ET\np̂(xi,xj |xF ) p̂(xi|xF )p̂(xj |xF ) .\nHence,\nmin q∈QF,T\nD(p̂||q) = D(p̂||q∗)\n−Hp̂(x) +Hp̂(xF ) + ∑ i∈V \\F Hp̂(xi|xF ) (14)\n+ ∑\n(i,j)∈ET\nˆ p̂F,i,j(xF ,xi,xj) log\np̂(xi,xj |xF ) p̂(xi|xF )p̂(xj |xF ) dxFdxidxj (15)\n= Hp̂(x) +Hp̂(xF ) + ∑ i∈V \\F Hp̂(xi|xF ) (16)\n− ∑\n(i,j)∈ET\nˆ p̂F,i,j(xF ,xi,xj) log\np̂(xi|xF )p̂(xj |xF ) p̂(xi,xj |xF ) dxFdxidxj (17)\n= −Hp̂(x) +H(p̂F ) + ∑ i∈V\\F H(p̂i|F |xF )− ∑ (i,j)∈ET Ip̂(xi;xj |xF ). (18)\nWe have thus proved Lemma 3.\nThe following Lemma 4 gives a closed-form expression for the K-L divergence between two Gaussians. It can be verified by calculus and the proof is omitted.\nLemma 4. For two n-dimensional Gaussian distributions p̂(x) = N (x; µ̂, Σ̂) and q(x) = N (x;µ,Σ), we have\nD(p̂||q) = 1 2\n( Tr ( Σ−1Σ̂ ) +(µ− µ̂) T Σ−1 (µ− µ̂)− n ln det ( Σ−1Σ̂ )) . (19)\nAn immediate implication of Lemma 4 is that when learning GGMs we always have that µML = µ̂ if there is no constraint on the mean in.\nLemma 5. If a symmetric positive definite matrix Σ is given and we know that its inverse J = Σ−1 is sparse with respect to a tree T = (V, E), then the non-zero entries of J can be computed using (20) in time O(n).\nJij =  (1− deg(i)) Σ−1ii + ∑ j∈N (i) ( Σii − ΣijΣ−1jj Σji )−1 i = j ∈ V Σij Σ2ij−ΣiiΣjj\n(i, j) ∈ E 0 otherwise,\n(20)\nwhere N (i) is the set of neighbors of node i in T ; deg(i) is the degree of i in T .\nProof. Since Σ 0, we can construct a Gaussian distribution p(x) with zero mean and covariance matrix Σ. The distribution is tree-structured because J = Σ−1 has tree structure T . Hence, we have the following factorization.\np(x) = ∏ i∈V p(xi) ∏ (i,j)∈E p(xi, xj) p(xi)p(xj) ,\nwhere\np(x) = 1\n(2π) n 2 (det J)\n− 12 exp{−1 2 xTJx}\np(xi) = 1\n(2π) 1 2Pii 1 2\nexp{−1 2 xTΣ−1ii x}\np(xi, xj) = 1\n2π ( det [ Σii Σij Σji Σjj ]) 1 2\nexp{−1 2 xT [ Σii Σij Σji Σjj ]−1 x}.\nBy matching the quadratic coefficient in the exponents, we have that\nJii = Σ −1 ii + ∑ j∈N (i) (([ Σii Σji Σij Σjj ]−1) 11 − Σ−1ii )\n= (1− deg(i)) Σ−1ii + ∑\nj∈N (i)\n( Σii − ΣijΣ−1jj Σji )−1 and for (i, j) ∈ E ,\nJij = ([ Σii Σij Σji Σjj ]−1) 12\n= Σij\nΣ2ij − ΣiiΣjj\nThe complexity of computing each Jij , (i, j) ∈ E is O(1) and the complexity of computing each Jii is O(deg i). Since Σi∈V deg(i) equals twice the number of edges, which is O(n), the total complexity is O(n).\nLemma 6. (The matrix inversion lemmas) If [ A B C D ] is invertible, we have[\nA B C D\n]−1 = [ (A−BD−1C)−1 −(A−BD−1C)−1BD−1 −D−1C(A−BD−1C)−1 D−1 +D−1C(A−BD−1C)−1BD−1 ] (21)\nor[ A B C D ]−1 = [ A−1 +A−1B(D − CA−1B)−1CA−1 −A−1B(D − CA−1B)−1 −(D − CA−1B)−1CA−1 (D − CA−1B)−1 ] (22)\nand ( A−BD−1C )−1 = A−1 +A−1B(D − CA−1B)−1CA−1. (23)\nThe proof of Lemma 6 can be found in standard matrix analysis books.\nB.3 Proof of Proposition 1\nProof. For a fixed FVS F , the LHS of (11) is only a function of the spanning tree among the nonfeedback nodes. Hence, the optimal set of edges among the non-feedback nodes can be obtained by finding the maximum spanning tree of the subgraph induced by T with Ip̂(xi;xj |xF ) ≥ 0 being the edge weight between i and j. 4\n4In fact, we have given an algorithm to learn general models (not only GGMs, but also other models, e.g., discrete ones) defined on graphs with a given FVS F . However, we do not explore the general setting in this paper.\nFor Gaussian distributions, the covariance matrix of the distribution p̂(xT |xF ) depends only on the set F but is invariant to the value of xF . Hence, finding the optimal edge set of the tree part is equivalent to running the Chow-Liu algorithm with the input being the covariance matrix of p̂T |F (xT |xF ), which is simply Σ̂T |F = Σ̂T − Σ̂M Σ̂−1F Σ̂TM . Let ECL = CLE(Σ̂T |F ) and ΣCL = CL(Σ̂T |F ). Denote\nthe optimal covariance matrix as ΣML = [ ΣMLF ( ΣMLM )T ΣMLM Σ ML T ] . According to (13), we must have ΣMLF = Σ̂F and Σ ML M = Σ̂M . From (13) the corresponding conditional covariance matrix Σ ML T |F of\nΣML must equal ΣCL. Hence, we have ΣMLT |F = Σ ML T − ΣMLM ( ΣMLF )−1 ( ΣMLM )T = ΣCL. Therefore, we can obtain ΣMLT = CL(Σ̂T |F ) + Σ̂M Σ̂ −1 F Σ̂ T M . We also have that EML = ECL since EML is defined to be the set of edges among the feedback nodes.\nNow we analyze the complexity of Algorithm 1. The matrix Σ̂T |F is computed with complexity O(kn2). Computing the maximum weight spanning tree algorithm has complexity O(n2 log n) using Kruskal’s algorithm (the amortized complexity can be further reduced, but it is not the focus of this paper). Other operations have complexity O(n2). Hence, the total complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(kn2 + n2 log n).\nNext we proceed to prove that we can compute all the non-zero entries of JML = (ΣML) −1 in time O(k2n).\nLet JML = [ JMLF ( JMLM )T JMLM J ML T ] . We have that JMLT = ( CL(Σ̂T |F ) )−1 has tree structure with T . Therefore, the non-zero entries of JMLT can be computed with complexity O(n− k).from Lemma 5. From (22) we have\nJMLM = −JMLT ΣMLM ( ΣMLF )−1 , (24)\nwhich can be computed with complexityO(k2n) by matrix multiplication in the regular order. Note that JMLT Σ ML M is computed in O(kn) since JMLT only has O(n) non-zero entries.\nFrom (22) we have\nJMLF = ( ΣMLF )−1 ( I + (( ΣMLM )T JMLT ) ( ΣMLM ( ΣMLF ))) ,\nwhich has complexity O(k2n) following the order specified by the parentheses. Note that( PMLM )T JMLT is computed in O(kn) because JMLT only has O(n) non-zero entries. Hence, we need extra complexity of O(k2n) to compute all the non-zero entries of JML. We have therefore completed the proof for Proposition 1.\nFor easy reference, we summarize the procedure to compute JML in Algorithm 6.\nAlgorithm 6 Compute JML = (ΣML) −1 after running Algorithm 1\n1. Compute JMLT using (20) 2. Compute JMLM = −JMLT ΣMLM Σ −1 F using sparse matrix multiplication\n3. Compute ( ΣMLF )−1 ( I + (( ΣMLM )T JMLT ) ( ΣMLM ( ΣMLF ))) following the order specified by\nthe parentheses using sparse matrix multiplication."

A necessary condition for the objective function to remain the same is that D(p̂(t)(xF ,xT )||p̂(t+1)(xF ,xT )) = 0, which implies that p̂(t)(xF ,xT ) = p̂(t+1)(xF ,xF ). Hence, it further implies that q(t)(xF ,xT ) = q(t+1)(xF ,xT ) under non-degenerate cases.
