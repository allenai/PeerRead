      "text" : "Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk or Crowdflower, have recently gained immense popularity due to their elegant framework, where a task requester can get work done by numerous virtual workers for very low compensation. One common problem in these platforms is that workers have to suffer huge latency to find suitable tasks, which creates dissatisfaction and eventually leads to the abandonment of the platform. Task recommendation problems are studied in the crowdsourcing context, where the objective is to recommend a set of tasks to each worker such that these tasks are best suited for the workers (Geiger and others 2014; Yuen and others 2012). In this work, we aim at leveraging the task completion history of the workers (referred to as implicit feedback) and augment that with explicit task characteristics or features to recommend tasks to the workers. Our focus of investigation is limited to citizen science crowdsourcing applications where the importance of effective task recommendation is pivotal (Xue and others 2013). We focus on the crowdsourcing of biodiversity observations, where volunteer visit sites, observe species, and report their findings via web applications. Currently, a volunteer, upon identifying a species, uploads information into the server specifying the details of the identification. A common problem which frequently occurs in this scenario is incorrect identification. A reliable task recommender system\nCopyright c© 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\ncan alleviate the problem. If we have historical data on how many tasks a volunteer has successfully performed and those observations are on what species and from which locations, then we can lower the risk in incorrect identification by asking volunteers to identify species they have prior experience with."

      "text" : "Notations: W = 〈w1, w2, w3 . . . wnw〉 and T = 〈t1, t2, t3, . . . tnt〉 represents the set of workers and tasks respectively. The relationship between workers and tasks is represented by matrix Cnw×nt , where cwi represents the number of times worker w has completed task i. The preference matrix P is a boolean version of C, such that pwi = 1, if cwi ≥ 1, otherwise pwi = 0. Ynt×nl represents the explicit task feature matrix, where yil ∈ {0, 1} denotes the absence or presence of feature l for task i. Worker feature preference matrix is denoted as Xnw×nl . Additionally, Unw×nf and Vnt×nf are the two latent factor matrices, where U is for the workers and V is for the tasks.\nFormulation 1 - Feature Preference Model: We assume that the reason that a particular worker has completed a particular task is because the worker has a hidden preference over the task features which we want to uncover. As an example, if locations are used as task features, we can learn the preference of workers for different location, which can be used for recommend new task to workers. Based on the explicit knowledge of task feature matrix Y and worker task completion matrix we learn the preference of each worker in the feature space or X . Formally, we want to minimize the following objective function.\nM = ∑ w,i qwi(pwi − xwyi)2 + λ(‖X‖2) (1)\nX ≥ 0 (2) qwi = 1 + α× cwi (3)\nHere, qwi is designed such that, the weight of positive signals is amplified. Q denotes the matrix representing the values of qwi for all workers and tasks. If a particular observation has high confidence the system will choose xw such that xwyi becomes close to 1. α is set to a positive value indicating the confidence for the positive signals over negative signals. By solving M , we get the solution for user\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n03 29\n1v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 S\nep 2\n01 6\nvector, xw = (Y tQwY + λI)−1Y tQwPw. Due to the nonnegativity constratint ofX , we solve the following optimization problem as ‖(Y tQwY +λI)xw−Y tQwPw‖2. We refer to our algorithm as Feat-Based-NNLS or Feature Based Non-Negative-Least Square.\nFormulation 2: Latent Factor Model: We consider the following objective function for task recommendation -\n(4)\nM = ∑ w,i qwi(pwi − uwvi)2\n+ λ(‖U‖2 + ‖V ‖2 − ∑ i,i′ vtiv ′ iSim(i, i ′))\nHere, the goal is to find U and V such that it minimizes the error, where λ is the regularization parameter. For any new task, the predicted recommendation score is calculated by multiplying Uw with Vi. To incorporate the task similarity into the latent factor based formulation, we add a penalty term in the equation. Our intuition is that if the similarity between any two tasks is high, then they should also be similar in the latent factor space. Our notion of task similarity is defined as sim(ti, tj) = 1\n1+e−Y t i Yj . The analytical solution for U and V is given below.\nuw = (V tQuV + λI)−1V tQwPw (5)\nvi = (U tQiU + λI)−1(U tQiPi + λ ∗ 0.5 ∗ nt∑ i′=1 Sim(i, i′)v′i)\n(6)\nWe solve the optimization problem by alternating and fixing U and V . This method is referred to as Implicit Factorization with Task Similarity or IFTS."

      "text" : "Dataset: We collected data from a popular citizen science platform named Ebird 1. Ebird is a popular citizen science platform for bird observations. We crawled all the observations from year 2012 and randomly choose a set of 5000 workers for our experiments leading to 1767 tasks with a total number of 2.5 million observations. We used 294 locations as task features.Evaluation: We evaluate our methods using a hold out test set. We randomly choose 90% of our data as the training set and remaining 10% as the test set which gives us the ground truth. All the results are an average of three runs.\nImplemented Baseline Algorithms: i)Implicit-ALS-Neg: This algorithm is implemented according to (Lin and others 2014).The algorithm uses alternating least square method considering negative signals. If a worker has not completed a task then the total number of times that task has been completed by other users is considered as the weight of the negative signal. ii) Feature-Based-Reg: We assume that the task-feature matrix V is given to us. We solve the regularized regression (Wu and others 2006) problem (Cij −xiyj)2+λ‖X‖2 to find X .\n1Ebird.org\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1\nPr ec is io n\nRecall\nFeature-Based-NNLS\nFeature-Based-Regression\nImplicit-ALS-Negative\nIFTS\nFigure 1: PR Curve\nAlgorithm MPR Impl-ALS-Neg 17.3 Feat-Based-Reg 13.706 Feat-Based-NNLS 5.68 IFTS 6.87\nTable 1: MPR\nEvaluation Metrics: We use Mean Percentile Ranking(MPR) proposed by (Hu and others 2008) for evaluating implicit feedback. The mathematical formula to calculate MPR is ∑ ij cijρij∑\nij cij . ρij is the percentile ranking of\nthe task j for worker i. Our recommendation is based on the estimated Worker-Task Preference matrix, P̂ . For Feat-Based-NNLS, P̂ = XY , where X is WorkerFeature matrix and Y is Task-Feature matrix. For IFTS, P̂ = UV . We experimented with different values of α and choose α = 50. We also use Precision Recall curve as our second evaluation method. In this method, we want to evaluate our method based on how many task in the test set we can correctly predict by taking only (t%) of the top-tasks. We vary t (in an increment of 1%) in a continuous manner and obtain PR curve.\nSummary of Results: The objective of our empirical study is to see how effective our proposed task recommendation models are in comparison with the baseline models. Our proposed algorithm Feature-Based-NNLS convincingly outperforms the baseline algorithms in both MPR and PR-Curve. The reason behind the worse performance of Implicit-ALS-Negative is that the worker does not choose tasks from a list of available task list, so a task that hasn’t been attempted by the user really has no preference rather than “negative preference”. IFTS also performs reasonably well compare to other methods."

We are the first to treat workertask completion history as implicit observations and incorporate task feature information for recommendation. Works in recommender systems such as (Forbes and Zhu 2011; Nguyen and Zhu 2013; Koren 2008) mostly rely on explicit feedback or content based feedback, whereas our model relies on implicit feedback. This precludes direct adaptation of their techniques."
