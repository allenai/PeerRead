      "text" : "Recent several years have witnessed the rapid development of neural machine translation (NMT) [Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015], which advocates the use of neural networks to directly model the translation process in an endto-end way. Thanks to the capability of learning representations from training data, NMT systems have achieved significant improvements over conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) across a variety of language pairs [JunczysDowmunt et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016].\nHowever, there still remains a major challenge for NMT: large-scale parallel corpora are usually non-existent for most language pairs. This is unfortunate because NMT is a datahungry approach and requires a large amount of data to fully train model parameters. Without sufficient training data, NMT tends to learn poor estimates on low-count events. Zoph et al. [2016] indicate that NMT obtains much worse translation quality than SMT when only small-scale parallel corpora are available.\nAs a result, improving neural machine translation on resource-scarce language pairs has attracted much attention in the community [Firat et al., 2016; Zoph et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016]. Most existing methods focus on leveraging data of multiple resource-rich language pairs to im-\nprove NMT for resource-scarce language pairs. Firat et al. [2016] propose multi-way, multilingual neural machine translation to achieve direct source-to-target translation even without parallel data available. Zoph et al. [2016] present a transfer learning method that transfers the model parameters trained for resource-rich language pairs to initialize and constrain the translation model training of resource-scarce language pairs. Johnson et al. [2016] introduce a universal NMT model for all language pairs, which takes advantage of multilingual data to improve NMT for all languages involved.\nBridging source and target languages with a pivot language is another important direction, which has been intensively studied in conventional SMT [Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Zahabi et al., 2013; El Kholy et al., 2013]. Pivot-based approaches assume that there exist source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora, which can be used to train source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models, respectively. One of the most representative approaches, triangulation approach, is to construct a source-to-target phrase table through combining source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target phrase tables. Another representative approach adopts a pivot-based translation strategy. As a result, source-to-target translation can be divided into two steps: the source sentence is first translated into a pivot sentence using the source-topivot model, which is then translated to a target sentence using the pivot-to-target model. Pivot-based approaches have been widely used in SMT due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and minimum requirement of multilingual data. Recently, Johnson et al. [2016] adapt pivot-based approaches to NMT and show that their universal model without incremental training achieves much worse translation performance than pivot-based NMT.\nHowever, pivot-based approaches often suffer from the error propagation problem: the errors made in the sourceto-pivot translation will be propagated to the pivot-to-target translation. This can be partly attributed to the discrepancy between source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora since they are usually loosely-related or even unrelated. To aggregate the situation, source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models are trained independently, which further enlarges the gap between source and target languages.\nIn this work, we propose an approach to joint training for pivot-based neural machine translation. The basic idea is to\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n04 92\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Fe\nb 20\n17\nconnect the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target NMT models and enable them to interact with each other during training. This can be done either by encouraging the sharing of word embeddings on the pivot language or by maximizing the likelihood of the cascaded model on a small source-target parallel corpus. Experiments on the Europarl and WMT corpora show that joint training of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models obtains significant improvements over independent training."

      "text" : "Given a source language sentence x and a target language sentence y, we use P (y|x;θx→y) to denote a standard attention-based neural machine translation model [Bahdanau et al., 2015], where θx→y is a set of model parameters.\nIdeally, the source-to-target model can be trained on a source-target parallel corpus Dx,y = {〈x(s),y(s)〉}Ss=1 using maximum likelihood estimation:\nθ̂x→y = argmax θx→y\n{ L(θx→y) } (1)\nwhere the log-likelihood is defined as\nL(θx→y) = S∑\ns=1\nlogP (y(s)|x(s);θx→y) (2)\nUnfortunately, parallel corpora are usually not readily available for low-resource language pairs. Instead, one can assume that there exist a third language called pivot with source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora available. As a result, it is possible to bridge the source and target languages with the pivot [Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Zahabi et al., 2013; El Kholy et al., 2013].\nLet z be a pivot language sentence. The source-to-target model can be decomposed into two sub-models by treating the pivot sentence as a latent variable:\nP (y|x;θx→z,θz→y) = ∑ z P (z|x;θx→z)P (y|z;θz→y) (3)\nLet Dx,z = {〈x(m), z(m)〉}Mm=1 be a source-pivot parallel corpus, and Dz,y = {〈z(n),y(n)〉}Nn=1 be a pivot-target parallel corpus. The source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models can be independently trained on the two parallel corpora, respectively:\nθ̂x→z = argmax θx→z\n{ L(θx→z) } (4)\nθ̂z→y = argmax θz→y\n{ L(θz→y) } (5)\nwhere the log-likelihoods are defined as:\nL(θx→z) = M∑\nm=1\nlogP (z(m)|x(m);θx→z) (6)\nL(θz→y) = N∑\nn=1\nlogP (y(n)|z(n);θz→y) (7)\nAs Figure 1 shows, a pivot-based translation strategy is usually adopted. Given an unseen source sentence to be translated x, the decision rule is given by:\nŷ = argmax y {∑ z P (z|x; θ̂x→z)P (y|z; θ̂z→y) } (8)\nDue to the exponential search space of the pivot language, the decoding process is usually approximated with two steps. The first step translates the source sentence x into a pivot sentence:\nẑ = argmax z\n{ P (z|x; θ̂x→z) } (9)\nThen, the pivot sentence is translated to a target sentence:\nŷ = argmax y\n{ P (y|ẑ; θ̂z→y) } (10)\nAlthough pivot-based approaches are widely for addressing the data scarcity problem in machine translation, they suffer from cascaded translation errors: the mistakes made in the source-to-pivot translation as shown in Eq. (9) will be propagated to the pivot-to-target translation as shown in Eq. (10). This can be partly attributed to the model discrepancy problem: the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models are quite different in terms of vocabulary and parameter space because the source-pivot and pivot-target parallel corpora are usually loosely-related or even unrelated. To make things worse, the source-to-pivot model P (z|x;θx→z) and the pivot-to-target model P (y|z;θz→y) are trained on the two parallel corpora independently, which further increases the discrepancy between two models.\nTherefore, it is important to reduce the discrepancy between source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models to further improve pivot-based neural machine translation."

The basic idea is to connect source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models and enable them to interact with each other during training. Our new training objective is given by:\nJ (θx→z,θz→y) = L(θx→z) + L(θz→y) + λR(θx→z,θz→y) (11)\nNote that the training objective consists of three parts: the source-to-pivot likelihoodL(θx→z), the pivot-to-target likelihood L(θz→y), and a connection term R(θx→z,θz→y). The hyper-parameter λ is used to balance the preference between likelihoods and the connection term.\nWe expect that the connection term associates the sourceto-pivot model θx→z with the pivot-to-target model θz→y and enables the interaction between two models during training. In the following subsection, we will introduce the three connection terms used in our experiments."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.2 Connection Terms",
      "text" : "It is difficult to connect the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models during training because the source-to-pivot and pivotto-target models are distantly-related by definition. More importantly, NMT lacks linguistically interpretable language structures such as phrases in SMT to achieve a direct connection at the parameter level [Wu and Wang, 2007].\nFortunately, both the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models include the word embeddings of the pivot language as parameters. It is possible to connect the two models via pivot word embeddings.\nMore formally, let Vzx→z be the pivot vocabulary of the source-to-pivot model and Vzz→y be the pivot vocabulary of the pivot-to-target model. We use w to denote a word in the pivot language and θwx→z ∈ Rd to denote the vector representation of w in the source-to-pivot model. θwz→y ∈ Rd is defined in a similar way.\nOur first connection term encourages the two models to generate the same vector representations for pivot words in the intersection of two vocabularies:\nRhard(θx→z,θz→y) = ∏\nw∈Vzx→z∩Vzz→y\nδ(θwx→z,θ w z→y) (12)\nwhere δ(θwx→z,θ w z→y) = 1 if the two vectors θ w x→z and θ w z→y are identical. Otherwise, δ(θwx→z,θ w z→y) = 0.\nAs word embeddings seem hardly to be exactly identical due to the divergence of natural languages, an alternative is to soften the above hard matching constraint by penalizing the Euclidean distance between two vectors:\nRsoft(θx→z,θz→y) = − ∑\nw∈Vzx→z∩Vzz→y\n||θwx→z − θwz→y||2 (13)\nThe third connection term assumes that there is a small bridging source-target parallel corpus Dx,y =\n{〈x(s),y(s)〉}Ss=1 (Bridging Corpus) available. The connection term is defined as the log-likelihood of the bridging data:\nRlikelihood(θx→z,θz→y)\n= S∑ s=1 logP (y(s)|x(s);θx→z,θz→y) (14)\n= S∑ s=1 log ∑ z P (z|x(s);θx→z)P (y(s)|z;θz→y)(15)"

However, calculating the gradients of the third connection term Rlikelihood(θx→z,θz→y) involves enumerating all possible pivot sentences in an exponential search space (see Eq. (15)).\nTo alleviate this problem, we follow standard practice to use a subset to approximate the full space [Shen et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2016]. Two methods can be used to generate a subset: sampling k translations from the full space [Shen et al., 2016] or generating a top-k list of candidate translations [Cheng et al., 2016]. We find that using top-k lists leads to better results than sampling in our experiments.\nWe use standard mini-batched stochastic gradient descent algorithms to optimize model parameters. In each iteration, three mini-batches are constructed by randomly selecting sentence pairs from the source-pivot parallel corpus Dx,z , the pivot-target parallel corpus Dz,y , and the bridging sourcetarget parallel corpus Dx,y (only available for the third connection term), respectively. After separate gradient calculation in each mini-batch, the gradients are collected to update model parameters."

German-English-French: German as the source language, English as the pivot language, and French as the target language.\nTable 1 shows the statistics of the Europarl and WMT corpora used in our experiments. We use tokenize.perl script for tokenization. For each language pair, we remove the empty lines and retain sentence pairs with no more than 50 words. To avoid the intersection of the source-pivot and pivot-target corpora, we split the overlapped pivot-language sentences of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target corpora into two separate parts with equal size and merge them separately with the non-overlapping parts for each language pair.\nThe Europarl corpus consists of 850K Spanish-English sentence pairs with 22.32M Spanish words and 21.44M English words, 840K German-English sentence pairs with 20.88M German words and 21.91M English words, and 900K English-French sentence pairs with 22.56M English words and 25.00M French words. The WMT 2006 shared task datasets are used as the development and test sets. The evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU [Papineni et al., 2002] as calculated by the multi-bleu.perl script.\nThe WMT corpus is composed of the Common Crawl, News Commentary, Europarl v7 and UN corpora. The Spanish-English parallel corpus consists of 6.78M sentence pairs with 183.01M Spanish words and 166.28M English words. The English-French parallel corpus comprises 9.29M sentence pairs with 227.06M English words and 258.95M French words. The newstest2011 and newstest2012 datasets serve as development and test sets. We use case-sensitive BLEU as the evaluation metric.\nWe use the attention-based neural machine translation system RNNSEARCH [Bahdanau et al., 2015] in our experiments. For the Europarl corpus in Table 1, we set the vo-\ncabulary size of all the languages to 30K which covers over 99% of words for English, Spanish and French and over 97 % for German. We follow Jean et al. [2015] to address rare words. For Spanish-English and English-French corpora from the WMT corpus, due to large vocabulary size, we adopt byte pair encoding [Sennrich et al., 2016b] to split rare words into sub-words. The size of sub-words is set to 43K, 33K, 43K respectively for Spanish, English, and French. These sub-words cover 100% of the text.\nWe set the hyper-parameter λ for balancing between likelihood and the connection term to 1.0. The threshold of gradients is set to 0.1. The bridging source-target parallel corpus contains 100K sentence pairs that do not overlap with the training data. We set k to 10 for calculating top-k lists to approximate the full search space. The parameters for the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models in the likelihood connection term are initialized by pre-trained model parameters."

For the source-to-target translation task, we present source-to-pivot, pivot-to-target and source-to-target translation results compared with independent training. In Spanish-to-French translation task, soft connection achieves significant improvements in Spanish-to-French and Spanishto-English directions although hard connection still performs comparably with independent training. In German-to-French translation task, soft and hard connections also achieve comparable performances with independent training.\nIn contrast, we find that likelihood connection dramatically improves translation performance on both Spanish-to-French and German-to-French corpora (up to +2.80 BLEU scores in Spanish-to-French and up to 2.23 BLEU scores in Germanto-French). The significant improvements for source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target directions are also observed. This sug-\ngests that introducing source-to-target parallel corpus to maximize P (y|x;θx→z,θz→y) with z as latent variables makes the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models improved collaboratively.\nTable 3 shows pivot and target translation examples of in-\ndependent training and our approaches. Apparently, our approaches improve translation quality of both pivot sentences and target sentences.\nAccording to Eq. (3), the cost of the source-to-target model can be decomposed into the cost of source-to-pivot and pivotto-target models. Because we have a small test trilingual corpus, (Spanish, English, French), we use the English sentence to approximate the latent variables in Eq. (3). Then we calculate the cost of Spanish-to-French on the trilingual corpus."

We observe that performance is much worse than that in Table 2 and Table 4 using the pivot-based translation strategy. It indicates that NMT yields poor performance on low-resource languages and the pivot-based translation strategy remedies the drawback to alleviate data scarcity effectively.\nWe also investigate the effect of the data size of bridging corpora on the likelihood connection. Table 7 shows that using a small parallel corpus (1K sentence pairs) has made a measurable improvement. When more than 50K sentence pairs are added, the further improvements become modest.\nThis finding suggests that a small corpus suffices to enable the likelihood connection to reach the reasonable performance."

Zhang and Zong [2016] propose two approaches, self-training algorithm and multi-task learning framework, to incorporate source-side monolingual corpora. Cheng et al. [2016] introduce an autoencoder framework to reconstruct monolingual sentences using source-to-target and target-to-source NMT models. The proposed model can exploit both source and target monolingual corpora. In contrast to Cheng et al. [2016], the objective of our likelihood connection is to maximize the probability of target-language sentences through pivot sentences given source sentences.

Although this problem can be alleviated by exploiting a pivot language to bridge the source and target languages, the source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models are usually independently trained. In this work, we introduce a joint training algorithm for pivot-based neural machine translation. We propose three methods to connect the two models and enable them to interact with each other during training. Experiments on Europarl and WMT corpora show that joint training of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target models leads to significant improvements over independent training across various languages.",
