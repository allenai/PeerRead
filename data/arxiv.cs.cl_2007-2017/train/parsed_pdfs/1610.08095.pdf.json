      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION User-generated reviews are a valuable resource to help people make decisions. Reviews may contain a wide range of both objective and subjective product-related information, including features of the product, evaluations of its positive and negative attributes, and various personal experiences and niche use-cases. Although a key factor in guiding many people’s decisions, it can be time-consuming for a user to digest the content in large volumes of reviews, many of which may not be relevant to their own opinions or interests.\nIn addition to passively searching for information that users are interested in among reviews, a number of ecommerce websites, such as Amazon and ebay, also provide community question answering systems where users can ask and answer specific product-related questions. While such systems allow users to seek targeted information (as opposed for searching for it in reviews), asking the community is still time-consuming in the sense that the user must wait for a response, and even then may have quite different preferences from the user who answers their questions.\nThe above issues motivate us to study systems that help users to automatically navigate large volumes of reviews in\norder to locate relevant and informative opinions, in response to a particular query.\nThis kind of ‘opinion question answering’ system (opinion QA) is quite different from typical community question answering (cQA) systems. In particular, traditional cQA systems are usually concerned with objective information, such that answers can be generated by constructing and exploring a knowledge-base which is composed of facts.\nHowever, for the opinion QA problem, users often ask for subjective information, such as “Is this a good lens for my Nikon D3300 camera?” Such a seemingly simple question is complex because it depends on (a) objective information (is the lens even compatible?); (b) subjective information (whether it’s ‘good’ is a matter of opinion); and (c) personalization (which answer is correct for the user asking the question; are they an expert? an amateur? on a budget? etc.). Perhaps not surprisingly, opinion QA systems generate a wide variety of subjective and possibly contradictory answers (see Figure 1, from Amazon).\nIdeally answers to this kind of question should leverage data describing personal opinions and experiences, such as the kind of information available in product reviews. To build systems capable of leveraging such information, a series of methods [1]–[3] for product-related opinion ques-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n08 09\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 2\n5 O\nct 2\n01 6\ntions answering have been developed. These methods can automatically retrieve potential answers from reviews based on different linguistic features. Many of these approaches develop information retrieval systems where traditional text similarity measures are explored and text fragments are filtered based on question types or the attributes of the product that users refer to in their questions [1], [2].\nRecently, a supervised approach, Mixtures of Opinions for Question Answering (MoQA) [3], was developed for opinion QA systems using product reviews. There, product-related questions were categorized into two types as follows: • Binary questions. A large fraction of questions in real-\nworld opinion QA data are binary questions where answers amount to either ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Such answers can easily be detected (i.e., to build a labeled dataset) in a supervised setting using a binary classifier [4]. When addressing binary questions, we are interested both in mining relevant opinions from reviews, but also providing a yes/no answer directly. • Open-ended questions. In addition to binary questions, a significant number of product-related questions are open-ended, or compound questions (etc.). It is usually impractical to answer such questions directly with an automated system. Instead, we are more interested in learning a good relevance function which can help us retrieve useful information from reviews, so that the user can be aided in reaching a conclusion themselves. In this paper, we continue to study these two types of questions. Where we extend existing work, and the main contribution of our paper, is to explicitly account for the fact that questions may have multiple, subjective, and possibly contradictory answers.1 We evaluate our system by collecting a new QA dataset from Amazon.com—consisting of 800 thousand questions and 3.1 million answers, which uses all of the available answers for training (in contrast to previous approaches, where each question was associated with only a single answer).\nOur main goals are to show quantitatively that by leveraging multiple answers in a supervised framework we can provide more accurate responses to both subjective and objective questions (where ‘accurate’ for a subjective question means that we can correctly estimate the distribution of views). Qualitatively, we aim to build systems that are capable of presenting users with a more nuanced selection of supporting evidence, capturing the full spectrum of relevant opinions."

      "text" : "Addressing this new view of question-answering is challenging, and requires new techniques to be developed in order to make use of multiple, possibly contradictory labels\n1Note that even binary questions may still be subjective, such that both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ answers may be possible.\nwithin a supervised framework. We identify two main perspectives from which ambiguity and subjectivity in productrelated opinion QA systems can be studied:\n• Multiple Answers. We notice that in previous studies, only one ground-truth answer is included for each question. However, in real-world opinion QA systems, multiple answers are often available. We find this to be true both for binary and open-ended questions. When multiple answers are available, they often describe different aspects of the questions or different personal experiences. By including multiple answers at training time, we expect that the relevant reviews retrieved by the system at test time should cover those subjective responses more comprehensively. • Subjective Reviews. In addition, as indicated in traditional opinion mining studies, reviews as reflections of users’ opinions may be subjective since different reviewers may have different expertise and bias. In some review websites, such as Amazon.com, review rating scores and review helpfulness can be obtained, which could be good features reflecting the subjectivity of the reviews. Intuitively, subjective information may affect the language that users apply to express their opinion so that their reviews should be handled to address questions accordingly. For example, ‘picky’ reviewers may tend to provide negative responses while ‘generous’ reviewers may usually provide more favorable information about the product. This motivates us to apply user modeling approaches and incorporate more subjective review-related features into opinion QA systems.\nThe above observations provide us with a strong motivation to study ambiguity and subjectivity from the perspective of multiple answers and subjective reviews in opinion QA systems. We conclude by stating the problem specifically as follows:\nGoal: Given a question related to a product, we would like to determine how relevant each review of that product is to the question with emphasis on modeling ambiguity and subjectivity, where ‘relevance’ is measured in terms of how helpful the review will be in terms of identifying the proper response (or responses) to the question."

      "heading" : "A. Standard Relevance Measures",
      "text" : "We first describe two kinds of similarity measures for relevance ranking in the context of our opinion QA problem as follows.\n1) Okapi BM25: One of the standard relevance ranking measures for information retrieval, Okapi BM25 is a bag-ofwords ‘tf-idf’-based ranking function that has been successfully applied in a number of problems including QA tasks [5], [6]. Particularly, for a given question q and a review r, the standard BM25 measure is defined as\nbm25 (q, r) = n∑ i=1 idf (qi)× f(qi, r)× (k1 + 1) f(qi, r) + k1 × (1− b+ b× |r|avgrl ) , (1)\nwhere qi, i = 1, . . . , n are keywords in q, f(qi, r) denotes the frequency of qi in r, |r| is the length of review r and avgrl is the average review length among all reviews.3 Here idf (qi), the inverse document frequency of qi, is defined as\nidf(qi) = log N − n(qi) + 0.5 n(qi) + 0.5 , (2)\nwhere N = |R| is the total number of reviews and n(qi) is the number of reviews which contain qi.\n2) Rouge-L: Next we consider another similarity measure, Rouge-L [7], which is a Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) based statistic. For a question q and a review r, if the length of their longest common subsequence is denoted as LCS (q, r), then we have RLCS = LCS (q, r)/|q| and PLCS = LCS (q, r)/|r|. Now Rouge-L is defined as\nFLCS = (1 + β2)RLCSPLCS RLCS + β2PLCS , (3)\nwhere β = PLCS/RLCS .\n3In practice we set k1 = 1.5 and b = 0.75."

      "heading" : "B. Mixtures of Experts",
      "text" : "Mixtures of experts (MoE) [8] is a supervised learning approach that smoothly combines the outputs of several ‘weak’ classifiers in order to generate predictions. Here, this method can be applied for opinion QA systems where each individual review is regarded as a weak classifier that makes a prediction about the response to a query. For each classifier (review), we output a relevance/confidence score (how relevant is this review to the query?), as well as a prediction (e.g. is the response ‘yes’ based on the evidence in this review?). Then an overall prediction can be obtained for a particular question by combining outputs from all reviews of a product, weighted by their confidence.\n1) MoE for binary questions: For a binary question, each classifier produces a probability associated with a positive label, i.e., a probability that the answer is ‘yes.’ Suppose for a question q, the associated features (including the text itself, the identity of the querier, etc.) are denoted Xq and the label for this question is denoted as yq (yq ∈ {0, 1}). Then we have\nP (yq|Xq) = ∑ r∈Rq how relevant is r︷ ︸︸ ︷ P (r|Xq) × prediction from r︷ ︸︸ ︷ P (yq|r,Xq) , (4)\nwhere r is a review among the set of reviews Rq associated with the question q. In (4), P (r|Xq) measures the confidence of review r’s ability in terms of responding to the question q, and P (yq|r,Xq) is the prediction for q given by review r. These two terms can be modeled as follows:\n(Relevance) P (r|Xq) = exp(vq,r)/ ∑\nr′∈Rq\nexp(vq,r′);\n(Prediction) P (yq = 1|r,Xq) = σ(wq,r), (5)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) is the sigmoid function. Here vq,r and wq,r are real-valued (i.e., unnormalized) ‘relevance’ and ‘prediction’ scores where multiple question and review related features can be involved.\n2) MoE for open-ended questions: Similarly, for an openended question, we may be interested in whether a ‘true’ answer aq is preferred over some arbitrary non-answer ā. For this we have a similar MoE structure as follows:\nP (aq > ā|Xq) = ∑ r∈Rq P (r|Xq)P (aq > ā|r,Xq). (6)\nThe relevance term can be kept the same while we have a slightly different prediction term:\nP (aq > ā|r,Xq) = σ(waq>ā,r). (7)\nHere waq>ā,r is a real-valued ‘prediction’ score where multiple answer and review features can be included."

If only one label is included for a question in the training procedure, we can train by maximizing the following log-likelihood:\nL = logP (Y|X ) = ∑ q [yq log pq + (1− yq) log(1− pq)] (8)\nwhere Θ includes all parameters and pq is modeled as in (4).\nA number of features can be applied to define the ‘relevance’ (vq,r) and ‘prediction’ (wq,r) functions. Previously in [3], only text features were used to define pairwise similarity measures and bilinear models. Starting with the same textonly model, suppose fq and fr are vectors with length N that represent bag-of-words text features for question q and review r. Then we define the ‘relevance’ function as follows:\nvq,r = pairwise similarities (bm25 etc.)︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈κ, s(q, r)〉 + term-to-term similarity︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈η,fq ◦ fr〉 , (9)\nwhere x◦y is the Hadamard product. Note that we have two parts in vq,r: (1) a weighted combination of state-of-the-art pairwise similarities; and (2) a parameterized term-to-term similarity. Following [3], we include BM25 [5] and RougeL [7] measures in s(q, r). Recall that the purpose of this function is to learn a set of parameters {κ,η} that ranks reviews in order of relevance.\nIn addition, we define the following prediction function:\nwq,r = interaction between q. & r. text︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈µ,fq ◦ fr〉 + prediction from r. text︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈ξ,fr〉 . (10)\nThe idea here is that the first term models the interaction between the question and review text, while the second models only the review (which can capture e.g. sentiment words in the review).\nTraining: Finally, to optimize the parameters Θ = {κ,η,µ,u} from (9) and (10), we apply L-BFGS [9]. To avoid overfitting, this model also includes a simple L2 regularizer on all model parameters."

      "text" : "So far, we have followed the basic approach of [3], assuming text-only features, and a single label (answer) associated with each question. But as we find in our data (see Section V), responses in real-world opinion QA systems have significant ambiguity, even for binary questions. However, in previous studies, only a single response was considered to each question. In this section we develop additional machinery allowing us to model ambiguity and subjectivity, and in particular to handle training data with multiple (and possibly contradictory) answers."

      "heading" : "A. Modeling Ambiguity: Learning with Multiple Labels.",
      "text" : "Notice that in the previous log-likelihood exppression (8), only one label can be included for each question. Below are two options to extend this framework to handle multiple labels.\n1) KL-MoE: A straightforward approach is to replace the single label yq in (8) by the the fraction of positive labels rq = n+q /(n + q + n − q ), where n + q , n − q are the number of positive and negative (yes/no) answers for question q. If we assume that for a question q, the response provided from the answers given follows Bernoulli(rq) and the response predicted from reviews follows Bernoulli(pq), then the objective function∑\nq\n[rq log pq + (1− rq) log(1− pq)] (11)\ncan be regarded as the summation of the KL-divergences between answers and predictions for all questions.\n2) EM-MoE: Note that only the ratio of positive and negative labels is included in the previous KL-divergence loss (11), while the real counts of positive and negative labels are discarded. However, this fraction may not be enough to model the strength of the ambiguity (or controversy) in the question. For example, a question with 10 positive and 10 negative labels seems more controversial than a question with 1 positive and 1 negative label. However, their positive/negative ratios rq are the same.\nTo distinguish such cases, instead of applying a fixed ratio rq , we use two sets of parameters, allowing us to incorporate multiple noisy labels at training time, and to update (our noisy estimate of) rq based on multiple labels yq,j and generated predictions pq iteratively using the EM-algorithm.\nSpecifically, for a binary question q, we model its ‘true’ answer yq as an unknown with probability distribution P (yq = 1|Xq,Θ), which is assumed to generate the provided (noisy) labels yq,j (j = 1, . . . , nq) independently.\nThen the joint probability of the observed labels is given by\nP (yq,1, . . . , yq,nq |Xq,Θ) = ∑\ni∈{0,1}\nP (yq,1, . . . , yq,nq |yq = i,Xq,Θ)P (yq = i|Xq,Θ)\n= ∑\ni∈{0,1} ( nq∏ j=1 P (yq,j |yq = i,Xq,Θ) ) P (yq = i|Xq,Θ)\n(12) Here we separate the joint probability into two parts: • P (yq = i|Xq,Θ) models the estimated distribution of the\n‘true’ answer yq from the provided reviews. • ∏nq\nj=1 P (yq,j |yq = i,Xq,Θ) models the probability of a given ground-truth label yq,j as a function of yq . Letting αq = P (yq,j = 1|yq = 1, Xq,Θ) and βq = P (yq,j = 0|yq = 0, Xq,Θ) for all j ∈ Sq , then αq and βq represent the ‘sensitivity’ (probability of a positive observation if the true label is positive) and ‘specificity’ (probability of a negative observation if the label is negative) for question q.\nNote that ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ questions may not be symmetric concepts (i.e., different types of questions may be more likely to have yes vs. no answers). Thus we model sensitivity and specificity separately, using features from the question text as prior knowledge. Specifically, we model α and β as:\nαq = σ(〈γ1,fq〉); βq = σ(〈γ2,fq〉). (13)\nThen we have the following joint distributions which are denoted as aq and bq:\naq := nq∏ j=1 P (yq,j |yq = 1, Xq,Θ) =α n+q q (1− αq)n − q\nbq := nq∏ j=1 P (yq,j |yq = 0, Xq,Θ) =(1− βq)n + q β n−q q .\n(14)\nNow based on (12), (13), and (14), we can consider maximizing following log-likelihood:\nL = logP (Y|X ,Θ) = ∑ q logP (yq,j , j = 1, . . . , nq|Xq)\n= ∑ q log (aqpq + bq(1− pq)) , (15)\nwhere pq = P (yq = 1|Xq,Θ) is modeled based on (4), (5), (9) and (10). Here the parameter set is Θ = {κ,η,µ,u,γ1,γ2}.\nInference: In contrast to MoE and KL-MoE, directly optimizing (15) is non-trivial. However, we can apply the EM Algorithm [10] to optimize it by estimating the label yq and the parameters Θ iteratively.\nBy introducing the missing labels {yq}, we have a complete likelihood expression\nLc = ∑ q (yq log aqpq + (1− yq) log bq(1− pq)) . (16)\n• In the E-step, we assume that parameters Θ are given. Then we take the expectation of yq in (16) and we obtain a new objective:\nELc = ∑ q (tq log aqpq + (1− tq) log bq(1− pq)) , (17)\nwhere\ntq = P (yq = 1|yq,1, ..., yq,nq , Xq) = aqpq\naqpq + bq(1− pq) .\n• In the M-step, once tq is obtained, similar to MoE and KL-MoE, we can apply L-BFGS [9] to optimize ELc with respect to Θ.\nThese two procedures are repeated until convergence.\nB. Incorporating Subjective Information\nEM-MoE-S. Subjective information from reviews (and reviewers) can be included to enhance the performance of both our relevance and prediction functions, including features such as review helpfulness, reviewer expertise, rating scores and reviewer biases. We can incorporate these features into our previous expressions for vq,r and wq,r as follows:\nvq,r = pairwise similarities︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈κ, s(q, r)〉 + term-to-term similarity︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈η,fq ◦ fr〉 + review’s helpfulness︷ ︸︸ ︷ 〈g,hr〉 + reviewer’s expertise︷︸︸︷ eur\nwq,r =( 〈µ,fq ◦ fr〉︸ ︷︷ ︸ interaction bet. q. &r. text + 〈ξ,fr〉︸ ︷︷ ︸ prediction from r. text )× (1 + c · rtr︸ ︷︷ ︸ rating score + bur︸︷︷︸ reviewer’s bias ).\n(18) As shown in Figure 1, here rtr is the star rating score and hr = (h (1) r , h (2) r )T represents the helpfulness features of review r where h(1)r , h (2) r are fractions of users who respectively find or do not find the review helpful. eur and bur are parameters that make up a simple user model; the former captures the overall tendency for a user u to write reviews that are likely to be ‘relevant,’ while the latter captures the tendency of their reviews to support positive responses. Note that both parameters are latent variables that are automatically estimated when we optimize the likelihood expression above."

As with binary questions, these open-ended questions may be subjective and multiple answers often exist in our data. What is different is that it is difficult for us to automatically judge whether these answers are consistent or not. Thus we aim to generate\ncandidate answers that cover the spectrum of ground-truth answers as much as possible.\nFirst we give some more detail about the basic framework with a single open-ended answer, which we described briefly in Section II-B2.

Among our labeled data, this approach achieved 97% precision and 82% recall in this manually labeled dataset.5\nFollowing this, we developed a simple logistic regression model to label observed answers to these binary questions. The features we applied are the frequency of each unigram plus whether the first word is ‘yes’ or whether it is ‘no’ (as is often the case in practice). Notice that since we want to study ambiguity that arises due to the question itself rather than due to any error in our machine labels, we need to ensure that the binary labels obtained from this logistic model are as accurate as possible. Thus again we sacrifice some recall and keep only those answers about which the regressor is most confident (here we kept the top 50% of most confident predictions). This gave us zero error on the held-out manually labeled data from [3]. Ultimately we obtained 88,559 questions with 197,210 highly confident binary labels of which around 65% are positive.

One might expect that the answer to such a question would be an unambiguous ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ since it is a (seemingly objective) question about compatibility. However the answers prove to be inconsistent since different users focus on different aspects of the product. Thus even seemingly objective questions question can prove to be ‘ambiguous,’ demonstrating the need for a model that handles such conflicting evidence. Ideally a system to address such a query would retrieve relevant reviews covering a variety of angles and in this case provide an overall neutral prediction.\nUltimately, around 14% of the questions in our dataset are ambiguous (i.e., multiple binary labels are inconsistent). Distributions of ambiguous/non-ambiguous questions are plotted in Figure 2a.

Since multiple labels are collected for a single question, and since we are comparing against methods capable of predicting only a single label, it is difficult to evaluate which system’s predictions are most ‘correct’ in the event of a conflict. Thus for evaluation we build two test sets consisting of decreasingly ambiguous questions. Our hope then is that by modeling ambiguity and personalization during training, our system will be more reliable even for unambiguous questions. We build two evaluation sets as follows: • Silver Standard Ground-truth. Here we simply regard\nthe majority vote among ambiguous answers as the ‘true’ label (questions with ties are discarded). • Gold Standard Ground-truth. More aggressively, here we ignore all questions with conflicting labels. For the remaining questions, we have consistent labels that we regard as ground-truth.\nNotice that all the questions and labels (ambiguous or otherwise) in the training set are involved in the training procedure of KL-MoE, EM-MoE and EM-MoE-S. We only attempt to resolve ambiguity when building our test set for evaluation.\nNaturally, it is not possible to address all questions using the content of product reviews. Thus we are more interested in the probability that the model will rank a random positive instance higher than a random negative one. We adopt the standard AUC measure, which for binary predictions is defined as:\nAUC b = ∫ ∞ −∞ TPR(t) d(FPR(t)), (26)\nwhere t is a threshold between 0 and 1. Suppose the label for question q is yq and the predicted probability of being positive from a particular model is p̂q . Then we have\nTPR(t) = ∑ q 1p̂q≥t,yq=1∑\nq 1yq=1 ; FPR(t) =\n∑ q 1p̂q≥t,yq=0\n1yq=0 .\nNote that this is different from the AUC in equation (23), which is in the context of open-ended questions. Note that a naı̈ve classifier (random predictions, random confidence ranks) has an AUC of 0.5.\n2) Baselines: We compare the performance of the following methods: • MoE. This is a state-of-the-art method for opinion QA\nfrom [3]. This is the model described in Section II-B. Here only a single label (the top-voted) is used for training, and text features from the reviews are included. • KL-MoE. This is a straightforward approach to include multiple labels by replacing a single label yq by the ratio of positive vs. negative answers (rq = n+q /(n + q + n − q ) in\n(8) (see Sec. III-A). • EM-MoE. To include all the labels instead of just a\nratio, we use an EM-like approach to update our estimates of noisy labels and parameters iteratively. Here question text features are used as prior knowledge to model the ‘sensitivity’ and ‘specificity’ regarding a question. • EM-MoE-S. Note that the above models only make use of features from reviews, and are designed to measure the performance improvements that can be achieved by harnessing multiple labels. For our final method, we include other subjective information into our model, such as user bieses, rating features, etc. (see Sec. III-B).\nUltimately the above baselines are intended to demonstrate: (a) the performance of the existing state-of-the-art (MoE); (b) the improvement from leveraging conflicting labels during training (KL-MoE and EM-MoE); and (c) the improvement from incorporating additional subjective information in the data (EM-MoE-S).\n3) Results and Discussion: Results of the above methods in terms of the AUC are shown in Table III. We notice that while KL-MoE is not able to improve upon MoE for\nall categories, EM-MoE and EM-MoE-S yield consistent improvements in all cases.6 This improvement is relatively large for some large categories, such as Cell Phones & Accessories and Electronics. Incorporating subjective features (EM-MoE-S) seems to help most for large categories, indicating that it is useful when enough training data is available to make the additional parameters affordable.\nWhen modeling ambiguity in opinion QA systems, a possible reason for the failure of KL-MoE is that the ratio rq involved in the objective function may not be a representative label for training. If the observed positive label ratio rq does not properly reflect the ‘true’ distribution, it could adversely affect the optimization procedure. In our EM-like frameworks, i.e., EM-MoE and EM-MoE-S, this ratio is replaced by a posterior probability, tq , which is updated iteratively. These EM-like frameworks are relatively more robust to data with multiple noisy labels compared with KL-MoE.\nEM-MoE-S includes subjective information related to reviews and reviewers. Due to the number of parameters involved, modeling reviewer expertise and bias is only useful for users who write several reviews, which is indeed a small fraction of reviewers. Thus in the larger categories these terms appear more useful, once we have enough observations to successfully model them.\nNote that the AUC represents the ranking performance on all questions. Generally, this value is relatively low in our experiments. This is presumably due to the simple fact that many questions cannot be answered based on the evidence in reviews. Since all of the methods being compared output confidence scores, we are interested in whether competing systems are correct in those instances where they have high confidence. If Q denotes the set of all the questions and Qa denotes the set of questions associated with the first largest (1−a)|Q| values of |p̂q−0.5| (i.e., the most confident about either a yes or a no answer), then we have the following measure for a given confidence threshold 0 ≤ a ≤ 1:\naccuracy@a = 1 |Qa| ∑ q∈Qa (1p̂q≥0.5,yq=1 + 1p̂q<0.5,yq=0). (27)\nRecall that the AUC measures the model’s ability to rank questions appropriately based on the ground-truth positive and negative labels. In contrast, the accuracy@a instead measures the model’s ability to correctly predict labels of those questions with highly confident output ranks. We plot this accuracy score as a function of a for the smallest category (Automotive) and the largest category (Electronics) in Figure 3. We notice that the improvement from modeling ambiguity (MoE vs. others) is relatively consistent for all confidence levels. However, modeling subjective information only seems to improve the performance on the most highly\n6Improvements in accuracy over MoE are statistically significant at the 1% level or better.\nconfident instances. For a small category like Automotive, since there is too little data to model those inactive reviewers, the EM-MoE-S model performs poorly on lowconfidence instances."

      "heading" : "B. Open-ended Questions",
      "text" : "After our previous procedure to distinguish binary vs. open-ended questions, we are left with a total of 698,618 open-ended questions (85% of all the questions) in our dataset. We plot the distribution of the number of answers provided to each open-ended question in Figure 2b and find that the majority of these questions have more than one answer provided.\n1) Evaluation Methodology: Our goal here is to explore whether using multiple answers at training time can provide us with more accurate results, in terms of the AUC of (23). In practice, for each answer a, we randomly sample one alternative non-answer ā from the pool of all answers.\nSuppose the output probability that answer a to question q is preferred over a non-answer ā is p̂q,a>ā. Then the AUC measure is defined as\nAUC o = 1 |Q| ∑ q 1 |Aq| ∑ a∈Aq 1(p̂q,a>ā > 0.5). (28)\nNote that although different answers are involved in the training procedures for different models, this evaluation measure is calculated in the same format for the same test data.\n2) Baselines: We compare the performance of the following methods: • s-MoE. This is the method from [3]. Here only the top-\nvoted answer is included for training. • m-MoE. We include all answers for each question in\nthis method and optimize the objective function in (24). Thus we evaluate whether training with multiple answers improves performance. • m-MoE-S. Similarly, we add additional subjective information to our model in order to evaluate the contribution of subjective features.\nAgain our evaluation is intended to compare (a) the performance of the existing state-of-the-art (s-MoE); (b) the improvement when training with multiple answers (m-MoE); and (c) the impact of including subjective features in the model (m-MoE-S).\n3) Results and Discussion: Results from s-MoE, mMoE and m-MoE-S are included in Table IV. We find that including multiple answers in our training procedure helps us to obtain slightly better results, while incorporating subjective information was not effective here. A possible reason could be that open-ended questions may not be as polarized as binary questions so that subjective information may not be as good an indicator as compared to the content of the review itself."

      "heading" : "VII. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "There are several previous studies considering the problem of opinion question answering [1]–[3], [13]–[17], where questions are subjective and traditional QA approaches may not be as effective as they have been for factual questions. Yu and Hatzivassiloglou [18] first proposed a series approaches\nto separate opinions and facts and identify the polarities of opinion sentences. Ku et al. [19] applied a two-layer framework to classify questions and estimated question types and polarities to filter irrelevant sentences. Li et al. [16] proposed a graph-based approach that regarded sentences as nodes and weighted edges by sentences similarity; by constructing such a graph, they could apply an ‘Opinion PageRank’ model and an ‘Opinion HITS’ model to explore different relations. Particularly for product-related opinion QA, i.e., addressing product-related questions with reviews, an aspect-based approach was proposed where aspect-rating data were applied [1]. In Yu et al. [2], a new model was developed to generate appropriate answers for opinion questions by exploiting the hierarchical organization of consumer reviews. Most recently, a supervised learning approach, MoQA, was proposed for the product-related opinion QA problem, where a mixture of experts model was applied and each review was regarded as an expert [3].\nOpinion mining is a broad topic where customer reviews are a powerful resource to explore. A number of opinion mining studies focus on opinion summarization [20], and opinion retrieval and search in review text [21]. In addition, review text can be used to improve recommender systems by modeling different aspects related to customers’ opinions [22], [23]. Subjective features and user modeling approaches were frequently applied in these studies, though they were not considered for the opinion QA problem.\nThe major technique of modeling ambiguity with multiple labels in this study is inspired by approaches for resolving noisy labels in crowdsourcing tasks [24]. Notice that the main target of crowdsourcing is to resolve conflicts from annotators and obtain the actual label instead of directly providing accurate predictions from data, which is different from the setting of answering subjective questions as in our opinion QA problem. In essence, our study can be regarded as a combination of question answering, opinion mining and the idea of learning from crowds."

    "abstractText" : "Product review websites provide an incredible lens into the wide variety of opinions and experiences of different people, and play a critical role in helping users discover products that match their personal needs and preferences. To help address questions that can’t easily be answered by reading others’ reviews, some review websites also allow users to pose questions to the community via a question-answering (QA) system. As one would expect, just as opinions diverge among different reviewers, answers to such questions may also be subjective, opinionated, and divergent. This means that answering such questions automatically is quite different from traditional QA tasks, where it is assumed that a single ‘correct’ answer is available. While recent work introduced the idea of question-answering using product reviews, it did not account for two aspects that we consider in this paper: (1) Questions have multiple, often divergent, answers, and this full spectrum of answers should somehow be used to train the system; and (2) What makes a ‘good’ answer depends on the asker and the answerer, and these factors should be incorporated in order for the system to be more personalized. Here we build a new QA dataset with 800 thousand questions—and over 3.1 million answers—and show that explicitly accounting for personalization and ambiguity leads both to quantitatively better answers, but also a more nuanced view of the range of supporting, but subjective, opinions.",
