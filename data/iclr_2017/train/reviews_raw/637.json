{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Rule Mining in Feature Space", "abstract": "Relational embeddings have emerged as an excellent tool for inferring novel facts from partially observed knowledge bases. Recently, it was shown that some classes of embeddings can also be exploited to perform a simplified form of rule mining. By interpreting logical conjunction as a form of composition between re- lation embeddings, simplified logical theories can be mined directly in the space of latent representations. In this paper, we present a method to mine full-fledged logical theories, which are significantly more expressive, by casting the semantics of the logical operators to the space of the embeddings. In order to extract relevant rules in the space of relation compositions we borrow sparse reconstruction pro- cedures from the field of compressed sensing. Our empirical analysis showcases the advantages of our approach.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper aims to mine explicit rules from KB embedding space, and casts it into a sparse reconstruction problem.

The idea is to interpret the successive application of relationships as the multiplication of the relation-dependent matrices in non-negative RESCAL. \n\nThe experimental section provides an evaluation of the rules that are found by the algorithm. Nonetheless, the work seems only at its first stages for now, and many questions are left open:\n\n1) while the approach to find rules seems very general, the reason why it should work is unclear. What properties of the embedding space or of the initial algorithm are required for this approach to find meaningful rules? Can we apply the same principles to other algorithms than non-negative RESCAL?\n\n2) there is no real evaluation in terms of link prediction. How can we use these rules in conjunction with the original algorithm to improve link prediction? What performance gains can be expected? Can these rules find links that would not be found be the original algorithm in the first place?\n\n3) scaling: for now the number of parameters of the rule miner is (#relationships)^(max. path length + 1).
