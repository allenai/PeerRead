      "text" : "Convolution neural networks (CNNs) [1] consist of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers. Convolution layers take inner product of the linear filter and the underlying receptive field followed by a nonlinear activation function at every local portion of the input. The resulting outputs are called feature maps. The visualization of CNN [2] gives hint that the activations in the feature map correspond to some latent concepts, a bigger value in the feature map indicates a higher probability that the corresponding input patch contains the latent concept. Thus we can view the activations in the feature maps as confidence values of latent concepts. The convolutional filter can also be seen as a linear binary classifier for local patches, and the separation hyperplane is defined by the filter.\nThe above process suffices when the latent concepts are linearly separable. However, the confidence of a latent concept is often a highly nonlinear function of the input data[3], leading to complex separation hyperplanes. The conventional CNN utilizes nonlinear rectifier layer to achieve better overall discriminability in the whole architecture while leaves the underlying assumption that the local latent concepts are linearly separable. Here, we argue that more discriminative local latent concept modeling can be achieved by replacing the conventional convolutional operation with a nonlinear network structure which we call “micro network”. In this work, we choose multilayer perceptron as the instantiation of the micro network, which is a universal function approximator and a neural network trainable by back-propagation.\nThe resulting structure compared with CNN is illustrated in Figure 1 which we call a mlpconv layer. Both the linear convolutional layer and the mlpconv layer map the local receptive field to a confidence value of the latent concept. The mlpconv consists of multiple fully-connected layers with nonlinear activation functions. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the multilayer perceptron over the input in a similar manner of CNN and are then fed into the next layer. The overall structure of our classification network is the stacking of multiple mlpconv layers. It is called “Network In Network” as we have micro networks to convolve the input of mlpconv layers which are composing\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n44 00\nv1 [\ncs .N\nE ]\n1 6\nD ec\n2 01\nelements of the overall deep network. Benefiting from more discriminative local micro network modeling, the feature maps obtained have much stronger semantic meaning. Therefore, instead of adopting the traditional fully connected layers for classification in CNN, we directly output the average of the feature maps from the last mlpconv layer as the confidence of categories via a global average pooling layer. The resulting vector is then softmaxed and used for classification."

      "text" : "Classic convolutional neuron networks consist of alternatively stacked convolutional layers and spatial pooling layers. The convolutional layers generate feature maps by a linear convolutional filter followed by a nonlinear activation function (rectifier, sigmoid, tanh, etc.). Using linear rectifier as an example, the feature map can be calculated as in Equation 1.\nfi,j,k = relu(w T k xi,j) (1)\nHere i and j are the pixel indexes in the feature map, xij stands for the input patch centered at location (i, j), and k is used to index the channels of the feature map.\nThis linear convolution is sufficient when the instances of the latent concepts are linearly separable. However, the confidence of the latent concepts are generally highly nonlinear functions of the input data. In conventional CNN, this might be compensated by utilizing an over-complete set of filters [4] to cover all variations latent concepts. Namely, individual linear filters can be learned to detect different variations of a same concept. However, having too many filters for a single concept imposes extra burden on the next layer, which needs to consider all combinations of variations from the previous layer[5]. As in CNN, filters from higher layers map to larger regions in the original input. It generates a higher level concept by combining the lower level concept from the layer below. Therefore, we argue that it would be beneficial to do a better classification on each local patches, before combining them into higher level concepts.\nIn the recent maxout networks [6], the number of feature maps is reduced by maximum pooling over affine feature maps. Maximization over linear functions makes a piecewise linear approximator which is capable of approximating any convex functions. Compared to conventional convolutional layers which perform linear separation, maxout network is more potent as it can separate convex sets which is the super set of linear subspaces. This improvement endows maxout network with the best performances on several benchmark datasets.\nHowever, maxout network imposes the prior that instances of a latent concept lie within a convex set in the input space which does not necessarily hold. It would be necessary to employ a more general function approximator when the distributions of the latent concepts are more complex. We seek to achieve this by introducing the novel “Network In Network” structure, in which a micro network is introduced within each convolutional layer as a stronger classifier for local patches."

      "text" : "Given no priors about the distributions of the latent concepts, it is desirable to use a universal function approximator for modeling of the local patches, as it is capable of approximating more general probability functions of the latent concepts. Radial basis network and multilayer perceptron are two well known universal function approximators. We choose multilayer perceptron in this work for two reasons: 1. Multilayer perceptron is compatible with the structure of convolutional neural networks, which is trained using back-propagation. 2. Multilayer perceptron can be a deep model itself, which is consistent with the spirit of feature re-use [3]. This new type of layer is called mlpconv in this paper, in which MLP replaces the linear filter and convolves over the input.\nFigure 1 illustrates the difference between linear convolutional layer and mlpconv layer. Note that in Figure 1 the generation of only one feature map is shown. When the mlpconv layer generates multiple feature maps (which is always the case), they can either each own a multilayer perceptron or share the hidden nodes. We choose the shared scheme because it requires less computation with the same number of parameters. The calculation performed by mlpconv layer is shown in Equation 2.\nf1i,j,k1 = relu(w 1 k1 T xi,j + bk1) ... fni,j,kn = relu(w n kn T fn−1i,j + bkn) (2)\nHere n is the number of layers in the multilayer perceptron. Rectified linear unit is used as the activation function in the multilayer perceptron.\nFrom cross channel(feature map) pooling point of view, Equation 2 is equivalent to multi step parametric cross channel pooling. Each pooling layer performs weighted linear recombination on the input feature maps, which then go through a rectifier linear unit. The cross pooled feature maps are cross pooled again and again in the next layers. This deep parametric cross channel pooling structure allows complex and learnable interactions of cross channel information.\nComparison to maxout layers: maxout layers in the maxout network performs max pooling across multiple affine feature maps [6]. The feature maps of maxout layers are calculated as in Equation 3.\nfi,j,k = max n\n(wTknxi,j) (3)\nMaxout over linear functions forms a piecewise linear function which is capable of modeling any convex function. For a convex function, samples with function values below a specific threshold form a convex set. Therefore, by approximating convex functions of the local patch, maxout has the capability of forming separation hyperplanes for concepts whose samples are within a convex set (i.e. l2 balls, convex cones). Mlpconv layer differs from maxout layer in that the convex function approximator is replaced by a universal function approximator, which has more capability in modeling various distributions of latent concepts."

      "text" : "Conventional convolutional neural networks perform convolution in the lower layers of the network. For classification, the feature maps of the last convolutional layer are vectorized and fed into fully connected layers followed by a softmax logistic regression layer [7] [6] [8]. This structure bridges the convolutional structure with traditional neural network classifiers. It treats the convolutional layers as feature extractors, and the resulting feature is classified in a traditional way.\nHowever, the fully connected layers are prone to overfitting, thus hampering the generalization ability of the overall network. Dropout is proposed by Hinton et al. [9] as a regularizer which randomly sets half of the activations from the fully connected layers to zero during training. It has successfully shown improvements on the generalization ability and largely prevents overfitting [7].\nIn this paper, we propose another strategy called global average pooling to improve the generalization ability of the network. The idea is to generate one feature map for each corresponding category of the classification task in the last mlpconv layer. Instead of adding fully connected layers on top of the feature maps, we take the average of each feature map, and the resulting vector is fed directly into the softmax layer. A vectorized view of global average pooling is that the output of the last mlpconv layer is forced into orthogonal subspaces for different categories of inputs. However, for fully connected layers, it does not impose this constraint. Another advantage of the global average pooling over fully connected layers is that there is no parameter to optimize thus overfitting is avoided.\nWe can see global average pooling as a structural regularizer that explicitly enforces feature maps to be confidence maps of concepts (categories in the last mlpconv layer). This is made possible by the mlpconv layer, as the multilayer perceptron can better model the confidence of the concepts."

As a regularizer, dropout is applied on the outputs of all but the last mlpconv layers. Unless stated specifically, all the networks used in the experiment section use global average pooling instead of fully connected layers at the top of the network.

We use the last 10,000 images of the training set as validation data.\nThe network used for CIFAR-10 contains three mlpconv layers, each of which uses a three layer perceptron to convolve its input. The number of feature maps for each mlpconv layer is set to the same number as in the corresponding maxout network. Two hyper-parameters are tuned using the validation set, i.e. the local receptive field size and the weight decay. After that the hyperparameters are fixed and we re-train the network from scratch with both the training set and the validation set. The resulting model is used for testing. We obtain a test error of 10.41% on this dataset, which improves more than one percent compared to the state-of-the-art. A comparison with previous methods is shown in Table 1.\nTo be consistent with previous works, we also evaluate our method on the CIFAR-10 dataset with translation and horizontal flipping augmentation.

The result is compared with previous works that adopted convolutional structures, and are shown in Table 4\nWe do not achieve better performance than the current best for the MNIST dataset.

      "heading" : "4.6 Global Average Pooling as a Regularizer",
      "text" : "Global average pooling layer is similar to fully connected layer in that they both perform linear transformations of the vectorized feature maps. The difference lies in the transformation matrix. For global average pooling, the transformation matrix is prefixed and it is non-zero only on block diagonal elements which share the same value. Fully connected layers can have dense transformation matrices and the values are subject to back-propagation optimization. To study the regularization effect of global average pooling, we replace the global average pooling layer with a fully connected layer, while the other parts of the model remain the same. We evaluated this model with and without dropout before the fully connected linear layer. Both models are tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a comparison of the performances are shown in Table 5.\nAs is shown in Table 5, fully connected layer without dropout regularization gave the worst performance (11.59%). It is expected as the fully connected layer overfits to the training data if no regularizer is applied. Adding dropout before the fully connected layer reduced the testing error (10.88%). Global average pooling has achieved the lowest testing error (10.41%) among the three.\nWe then explored whether the global average pooling had the same regularization effect for conventional CNNs. We instantiated a conventional CNN as described by Hinton et al. [9], which consists of three convolutional layers and one local connection layer. The local connection layer generated 16 feature maps which were fed to a fully connected layer with dropout. To make the comparison fair, we reduced the feature map number of the local connection layer from 16 to 10, since only one feature map is allowed for each category in the global average pooling scheme. A equivalent network with global average pooling is then created by replacing the dropout + fully connected layer with global average pooling. The performances were tested on the CIFAR-10 dataset.\nWe achieved a similar performance (15.99%) as reported by Hinton et al. [9] for convectional CNN with fully connected layer and dropout. Replacing the fully connected layer with global average pooling layer slightly hampered the performance (test error 16.46%). As the global average pooling enforces each feature map to be correspondence to one of the categories in the classification task, it work out in NIN because the multilayer perceptrons in mlpconv layers made the feature maps more semantic meaningful. But for linear convolutional layers this constraint might be too strong. Nevertheless, the regularization effect is still obvious as the error rate is 17.56% when using no regularizer at all."

      "text" : "We explicitly enforce feature maps in the last mlpconv layer of NIN to be confidence maps of the categories by means of global average pooling, which is possible only with stronger local receptive field modeling, e.g. mlpconv in NIN. To understand how much this purpose is accomplished, we extract and directly visualize the feature maps from the last mlpconv layer of the trained model for CIFAR-10.\nFigure 3 shows some examplar images and their corresponding feature maps for each of the ten categories selected from CIFAR-10 test set. It is expected that largest activations are observed in the feature map corresponding to the ground truth category of the input image; as this is enforced by global average pooling. Within the feature map of the ground truth category, we observed that the strongest activations appear roughly at the same region of the object in the original image. It is especially true for structured objects, for examples the car in the second row of Figure 3. Note that the feature maps for the categories are trained with only category information. Better results are expected if bounding boxes of the objects are used for fine grained labels. Another interesting observation in Figure 3 is the confusion between categories. For example, the car in the second row has some activations in the feature map for truck; the deer in the fifth row has some activations in the feature map for horse.\nThe visualization again demonstrates the effectiveness of NIN. It is achieved via a stronger local receptive field modeling using mlpconv layers, the global average pooling then enforces the learning of category level feature maps. Further exploration can be made towards general object detection. Detection results can be achieved based on the category level feature maps in the same flavor as in the scene labeling work of Farabet et al. [16]"

    "abstractText" : "We propose a novel network structure called “Network In Network”(NIN) to enhance the model discriminability for local receptive fields. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to handle the variance of the local receptive fields. We instantiate the micro neural network with a nonlinear multiple layer structure which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner of CNN and then fed into the next layer. The deep NIN is thus implemented as stacking of multiple sliding micro neural networks. We demonstrated state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR 10/100, SVHN and MINST datasets.",
