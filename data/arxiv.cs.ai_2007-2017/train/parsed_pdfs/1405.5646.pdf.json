      "text" : "Optimization problems related to strings—such as protein or DNA sequences—are very common in bioinformatics. Examples include string consensus problems such as the far-from most string problem [20, 19], the longest common subsequence problem and its variants [14, 22], and alignment problems [12]. These problems are often computationally very hard, if not even NP -hard [9]. In this work we deal with the minimum common string partition (MCSP) problem, which can be described as follows. We are given two related input strings that have to be partitioned each into the same collection of substrings. The size of the collection is subject to minimization. A formal description of the problem will be provided in Section 1.1. The MCSP problem has applications, for example, in the bioinformatics field. Chen et al. [2] point out that the MCSP problem is closely related to the problem of sorting by reversals with duplicates, a key problem in genome rearrangement.\nar X\niv :1\n40 5.\n56 46\nv1 [\ncs .A\nIn this paper we introduce the first integer linear program (ILP) for solving the MCSP problem. An experimental evaluation on problem instances from the related literature shows that this ILP can be efficiently solved, for example, by using any version of IBM ILOG CPLEX. However, a study on new instances of larger size demonstrates the limitations of the model. Therefore, we additionally introduce a deterministic 2-phase heuristic which is strongly based on the original ILP. The experimental evaluation shows that the heuristic is applicable to larger problem instances than the original ILP. Moreover, it is shown that the heuristic outperforms competitor algorithms from the related literature on known problem instances."

      "text" : "The MCSP problem can technically be described as follows. Given are two input strings s1 and s2, both of length n over a finite alphabet Σ. These two strings are required to be related, which means that each letter appears the same number of times in each of them. Note that this definition implies that s1 and s2 have the same length. A valid solution to the MCSP problem is obtained by partitioning s1 into a set P1 of non-overlapping substrings, and s2 into a set P2 of non-overlapping substrings, such that P1 = P2. Moreover, we are interested in finding a valid solution such that |P1| = |P2| is minimal.\nConsider the following example. Given are DNA sequences s1 = AGACTG and s2 = ACTAGG. Obviously, s1 and s2 are related because A and G appear twice in both input strings, while C and T appear once. A trivial valid solution can be obtained by partitioning both strings into substrings of length 1, that is, P1 = P2 = {A,A,C,T,G,G}. The objective function value of this solution is 6. However, the optimal solution, with objective function value 3, is P1 = P2 = {ACT,AG,G}."

      "text" : "The MCSP problem has been introduced by Chen et al. [2] due to its relation to genome rearrangement. More specifically, it has applications in biological questions such as: May a given DNA string possibly be obtained by rearrangements of another DNA string? The general problem has been shown to be NP -hard even in very restrictive cases [10]. Other papers concerning problem hardness consider, for example, the k-MCSP problem, which is the version of the MCSP problem in which each letter occurs at most k times in each input string. The 2-MCSP problem was shown to be APX-hard in [10]. When the input strings are over an alphabet of size c, the corresponding problem is denoted as MCSPc. Jiang et al. proved that the decision version of the MCSPc problem is NP -complete when c ≥ 2 [15].\nThe MCSP has been considered quite extensively by researchers dealing with the approximability of the problem. Cormode and Muthukrishnan [4], for example, proposed an O(lognlog∗n)-approximation for the edit distance with moves problem, which is a more general case of the MCSP problem. Shapira and Storer [21] extended on this result. Other approximation approaches for the MCSP problem have been proposed in [18]. In this context, Chrobak et al. [3] studied a simple greedy approach for the MCSP problem, showing that the approximation ratio concerning the 2-MCSP problem is 3, and for the 4-MCSP problem the approximation ratio is Ω(log(n)). In the case of the general MCSP problem, the approximation ratio is between Ω(n0.43) and O(n0.67), assuming that the input strings use an alphabet of size O(log(n)). Later Kaplan and Shafir [16] raised the lower bound to Ω(n0.46).\nKolman proposed a modified version of the simple greedy algorithm with an approximation ratio of O(k2) for the k-MCSP [17]. Recently, Goldstein and Lewenstein proposed a greedy algorithm for the MCSP problem that runs in O(n) time (see [11]). He [13] introduced a greedy algorithm with the aim of obtaining better average results.\nDamaschke [5] was the first one to study the fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of the problem. Later, Jiang et al. [15] showed that both the k-MCSP and MCSPc problems admit FPT algorithms when k and c are constant parameters. Finally, Fu et al. [8] proposed a O(2nnO(1)) time algorithm for the general case and an O(n(logn)2) time algorithm applicable under some constraints.\nTo our knowledge, the only metaheuristic approaches that have been proposed in the related literature for the MCSP problem are (1) the MAX -MIN Ant System by Ferdous and Sohel [6, 7] and (2) the probabilistic tree search algorithm by Blum et al. [1]. Both works applied their algorithm to a range of artificial and real DNA instances from [6]."

The second column contains the results of the greedy algorithm from [3] (results were taken from [6]). The third column provides the value of the best solution found in four independent runs per problem instance (with a CPU time limit of 7200 seconds per run) by the Aco approach by Ferdous and Sohel [6, 7].2 The fourth column provides the value of the best solution found in 10 independent runs per problem instance (with a CPU time limit of 1000 seconds per run) by the probabilistic tree search algorithm (henceforth labelled TreSea) by Blum et al. [1]. TreSea was run on the same machines as the ones used for the current work. Finally, the last four table columns are dedicated to the presentation of the results provided by solving model Ilporig. The first one of these columns provides the value of the best solution found within 3600 CPU seconds. In case the optimality of the corresponding solution was proved by CPLEX, the value is marked by an asterix. The second column dedicated to Ilporig provides the computation time (in seconds). In case of having solved the corresponding problem to optimality, this column only displays one value indicating the time needed by CPLEX to solve the problem. Otherwise, this column provides two values in the form X/Y, where X corresponds to the time at which CPLEX was able to find the first valid solution, and Y corresponds to the time at which CPLEX found the best solution within 3600 CPU seconds. The third one of the columns dedicated to Ilporig shows the optimality gap, which refers to the gap between the value of the best valid solution and the current lower bound at the time of stopping a run. Finally, the last column indicates the size of set B, that is, the size of the complete set of common blocks. Note that this value corresponds to the number of variables used by Ilporig. The best result (among all algorithms) for each problem instance is marked by a grey background, and the last row of each table provides averages over the whole table.\nThe following conclusions can be drawn when analyzing the results. First, CPLEX is able to solve all instances of Group1 to optimality. This is done, on average, in about 13 seconds. Moreover, none of the existing algorithms was able to find any of these optimal solutions. Second, CPLEX was also able to find new best-known solutions for all remaining 35 problem instances, even though it was not able to prove optimality within 3600 CPU seconds, which is indicated by the positive optimality gaps. An exception is instance 1 of set Real which also could be solved to optimality. Third, the improvements over the competitor algorithms obtained by solving Ilporig with CPLEX are remarkable. In particular, the average improvement (in percent) over TreSea, the best competitor from the literature, is 4.8% in the case of Group1, 9.2% in the case of Group2, 9.7% in the case of Group3, and 9.8% in the case\n2In this context, note that the experiments for Aco were performed on a computer with an ”Intel(R) 2 Quad” CPU with 2.33 GHz and 4 GB of RAM.\nof Real.\nIn order to study the limits of solving Ilporig with CPLEX we randomly generated larger DNA instances. In particular, we generated one random instance for each input string size from {800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, 2000}. CPLEX was stopped when at least 3600 CPU seconds had passed and at least one feasible solution had been found. However, if after 12 CPU hours still no feasible solution was found, the execution was stopped as well. The\nresults are shown in Table 5. The first column of this table provides the length of the corresponding random instance. The remaining four columns contain the same information as already explained in the context of Tables 1-4, just that column time (s) simply provides the computation time (in seconds) at which the best solution was found. Analyzing the results we can observe that the application of CPLEX to Ilporig quickly becomes unpractical with growing input string size. For example, the first valid solution for the instance with string length 1400 was found after 20616 seconds. Concerning the largest problem instance, no valid solution was found within 12 CPU hours."

      "text" : "As shown at the end of the previous section, the application of CPLEX to Ilporig reaches its limits starting from an input string size of about 1200. However, if it were possible to considerably reduce the size of the set of common blocks (B), mathematical programming might still be an option to obtain good (heuristic) solutions. With this idea in mind we studied the distribution of the lengths of the strings of the common blocks in B for all 45 problem instances. This distribution is shown—averaged over the instances of each of the four instance sets–in Figure 1. Analyzing these distributions it can be observed, first of all,\nthat the distribution does not seem to depend on instance size.3 However, the important aspect to observe is that around 75% of all the common blocks contain strings of length 1. Moreover, only a very small portion of these common blocks will form part of an optimal solution. In comparison, it is reasonable to assume that a much larger percentage of the blocks corresponding to large strings will form part of an optimal solution. These observations gave rise to the heuristic which is outlined in the following."

      "heading" : "3.1 Heuristic",
      "text" : "The proposed heuristic works in two phases. In the first phase, a subset of B (the complete set of common blocks) must be chosen. For this purpose, let B≥l (where l ≥ 1) denote the subset of B that contains all common blocks bi from B with |ti| ≥ l, that is, all blocks whose corresponding string is longer or equal than l. Note, in this context, that B≥1 = B. Moreover, note that |B≥1| ≥ |B≥2| ≥ |B≥3| ≥ . . . ≥ |B≥∞|. Let lmax be the smallest value for l such that |B≥lmax | > 0. Observe that B≥lmax only contains the common blocks with the longest strings. Having chosen a specific value for l from [2, lmax], the following ILP, henceforth referred to as Ilpph1, may be solved.\n3Most probably the distribution would change in some way when changing the size of the alphabet.\nmax ∑\nbi∈B≥l\n(C · |ti| − 1) · xi\nsubject to:∑ bi∈B≥l |ti| · xi ≤ n\n∑ bi∈B≥l M1i,j · xi ≤ 1 for j = 1, . . . , n\n∑ bi∈B≥l M2i,j · xi ≤ 1 for j = 1, . . . , n\nxi ∈ {0, 1} for bi ∈ B≥l\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\nIlpph1 is based on a binary variable xi for each common block bi ∈ B≥l. Moreover, matrices M1 and M2 are the same as the ones introduced in Section 2.2, that is, they are defined over the whole set B. The objective function basically maximizes the sum of the lengths of the strings corresponding to the chosen common blocks. However, the length of the string corresponding to each block is multiplied by a large-enough constant C, and the result is decremented by one. This has the following effect. In case of several solutions for which the sum of the lengths of the strings corresponding to the selected common blocks is equal, the program prefers the solution that reaches this sum with fewer common blocks. The constraints (6-8) are the same as in Ilporig (see Section 2.2), apart from the fact that all equality symbols are replaced by the ≤-symbol. In short, the idea of Ilpph1 is to produce a partial solution for the original MCSP that covers as much as possible of both input strings, while choosing as few common blocks as possible.\nSolving Ilpph1 will henceforth be referred to as phase 1 of the proposed heuristic. Let us denote by Sph1 the solution provided by phase 1.4 Due to the constraints of Ilpph1 this solution is a valid partial solution to the original MCSP problem. The idea of the second phase is then to produce the best complete solution possible that contains Sph1. This is done by solving the following ILP, henceforth referred to as Ilpph2.\nmin ∑\nbi∈Bph2\nxi\nsubject to:∑ bi∈Bph2 |ti| · xi = n\n∑ bi∈Bph2 M1i,j · xi = 1 for j = 1, . . . , n\n∑ bi∈Bph2 M2i,j · xi = 1 for j = 1, . . . , n\nxi = 1 for bi ∈ Sph1 xi ∈ {0, 1} for bi ∈ Bph2\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n4Remember that solutions are subsets of B.\nHereby, Bph2 := B(Sph1) ⊂ B is the set of common blocks that may be added to Sph1 without violating any constraints.5 Note that model Ilpph2 is the same as model Ilporig, just that Ilpph2 only considers common blocks from Bph2 and that it forces any solution to contain all common blocks from Sph1; see constraints (13). This completes the description of the heuristic."

The two ILP models were solved with IBM ILOG CPLEX V12.1, and the same machines as for the experimental evaluation of Ilporig were used for running the experiments.\nAs mentioned before, the heuristic may be applied for any value of l from the interval [2, lmax]. In fact, we applied the heuristic to each of the 45 problem instances from sets Group1, Group2, Group3, and Real, with all possible values for l. In order not to spend too much computation time the following stopping criterion was used for each call to CPLEX concerning any of the two involved ILP models. CPLEX was stopped (1) in case a provenly optimal solution was obtained or (2) in case at least 50 CPU seconds were spent and the first valid solution was obtained. The overall result of the heuristic for a specific problem instance is the value of the best solution found for any value of l. Moreover, as computation time we provide the sum of the computation times spend for all applications for different value of l.\nThe results are shown in Table 6, which contains one subtable for each of the four instance sets. Each subtable has the following format. The first column provides the instance identifier. The second column contains the value of the best solution found in the literature.

The first one of these columns contains the value of the best solution generated by the heuristic, while the second column provides the total computation time (in seconds).

Moreover, the best result for each instance is marked by a grey background, and those cases in which the result of applying CPLEX to Ilporig could be matched are marked by a ”+” symbol.\nThe results allow to make the following observations. First, our heuristic is able to improve the best-known result from the literature in 37 out of 46 cases. In further six cases the bestknown results from the literature are matched. Finally, in two remaining cases the heuristic is not able to produce a solution that is at least as good as the best-known solution known from the literature. Overall, the heuristic improves by 3.4% (on average) over the best known results from the literature. On the downside, the heuristic is only able to match the results of applying CPLEX to model Ilporig in three out of 45 cases. However, this changes with growing instance size, as we will show later in Section 3.4."

Finally, the bars in the background of the graphic present the values of the solutions that were generated with different values of l. The graphics on the right hand side present the corresponding computation times required by solving the different models.\nThe following observations can be made. When the value of l is close to the lower or\nthe upper bound—that is, either close to 2 or close to lmax—one of the two involved sets of common blocks is quite large, and, therefore, the computation time needed for solving the corresponding ILP may be large, in particular when the input instance is rather large. On the contrary, for intermediate values of l, the size of both involved sets of common blocks is moderate, and, therefore, CPLEX is rather fast in providing solutions, even if the optimal solution is not found (or can not be proven) within 50 CPU seconds. Moreover, the best results are usually obtained for intermediate values of l.

First, apart from the smallest problem instance, the heuristic outperforms the application of CPLEX to model Ilporig. Moreover, this is achieved in a fraction of the time needed by CPLEX. Finally, it is reasonable to assume that the success of the heuristic is due to an important reduction of the common blocks that are considered (see last table column). In general, the heuristic only considers between 3.3% and 6.5% of all common blocks.

The results show that provenly optimal solutions can be obtained for problem instances of small and medium size from the literature by solving the proposed integer linear programming model with CPLEX.
