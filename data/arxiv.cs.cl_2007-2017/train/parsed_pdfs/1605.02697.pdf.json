      "text" : "With the advances of natural language processing and image understanding, more complex and demanding tasks have become within reach. Our aim is to take advantage of the most recent developments to push the state-of-the-art for answering natural language questions on real-world images. This task unites inference of a question intent and visual scene understanding with an answer generation task.\nRecently, architectures based on the idea of layered, endto-end trainable artificial neural networks have improved the state of the art across a wide range of diverse tasks. Most prominently Convolutional Neural Networks have raised the bar on image classification tasks [Krizhevsky et al., 2012] and Long Short Term Memory Networks [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] are dominating performance on a range of sequence prediction tasks such as machine translation [Sutskever et al., 2014].\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n02 69\n7v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n4 N\nov 2\nMost recently, these two trends of employing neural architectures have been combined fruitfully with methods that can generate image [Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015] and video descriptions [Venugopalan et al., 2015a]. Both are conditioned on the visual features that stem from deep learning architectures and employ recurrent neural network approaches to produce descriptions.\nTo further push the boundaries and explore the limits of deep learning architectures, we propose an architecture for answering questions about images. In contrast to prior work, this task needs conditioning on language as well visual input. Both modalities have to be interpreted and jointly represented as an answer depends on inferred meaning of the question and image content.\nWhile there is a rich body of work on natural language understanding that has addressed textual question answering tasks based on semantic parsing, symbolic representation and deduction systems, which also has seen applications to question answering about images [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a], there is evidence that deep architectures can indeed achieve a similar goal [Weston et al., 2014]. This motivates our work to seek end-to-end architectures that learn to answer questions in a single, holistic model.\nWe propose Ask Your Neurons, an approach to question answering with a recurrent neural network at its core. An overview is given in Figure 1. The image information is encoded via a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the question together with the visual representation is fed into a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The system is trained to produce the correct answer to the question about the image. CNN and LSTM are trained jointly and end-toend starting from words and pixels.\nOutline. In Section 3, we present our novel approach based on recurrent neural networks for the challenging task of answering questions about images, which we presented originally in Malinowski et al. [2015]. The approach combines a CNN with an LSTM into an end-to-end architecture that predicts answers conditioning on a question and an image. Section 4 shows that the proposed approach doubles performance compared to a prior symbolic approach on this task. We collect additional data to study human consensus on this task, propose two new metrics sensitive to these effects, and provide a new baseline, by asking humans to answer the questions without observing the image. We demonstrate a variant of our system that also answers question without accessing any visual information, which beats the human baseline. We also frame the multimodal approach to answer questions about images that combines LSTM with CNN [Malinowski et al., 2015] as a special instance of an encoder-decoder framework. This modular perspective, shown in Section 3.2, allows us to study different design choices on a large scale visual question answering dataset VQA.\nSection 6 shows our analysis that leads to an improved visual question answering architecture. A deeper visual encoding together with several important design choices lead to a model that achieves stronger performance on VQA and DAQUAR datasets."

      "text" : "Since we have proposed a challenge and first methods for answering questions about real-world images [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a,b, 2015, Malinowski et al., 2015], frequently also referred to as “Visual Question Answering”, numerous follow up works have appeared. In the following we first discuss related tasks and subtasks, then early approaches to tackle a broader Visual Turing Test and datasets proposed for it. Finally, we discuss the relations to our work.\n2.1 Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition\nOne component to answer questions about images is to extract information from visual content. Since the proposal of AlexNet [Krizhevsky et al., 2012], Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become dominant and most successful approaches to extract relevant representation from the image. CNNs directly learn the representation from the raw image data and are trained on large image corpora, typically ImageNet [Russakovsky et al., 2014]. Interestingly, after these models are pre-trained on ImageNet, they can typically be adapted for other tasks. In this work, we evaluate how well the most dominant and successful CNN models can be adapted for the Visual Turing Test. Specifically, we evaluate AlexNet [Krizhevsky et al., 2012], VGG [Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014], GoogleNet [Szegedy et al., 2014], and ResNet [He et al., 2015]. These models, reportedly, achieve more and more accurate results on the ImageNet dataset, and hence, arguably, serve as increasingly stronger models of visual perception.\n2.2 Encodings for text sequence understanding\nThe other important component to answer a question about an image is to understand the natural language question, which means here building a representation of a variable length sequence of words (or characters, but we will focus only on the words in this work). The first approach is to encode all words of the question as a Bag-Of-Words [Manning and Schütze, 1999], and hence ignoring an order in the sequence of words. Another option is to use, similar to the image encoding, a CNN with pooling to handle variable length input [Kim, 2014, Kalchbrenner et al., 2014]. Finally, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are methods developed to\ndirectly handle sequences, and have shown recent success on natural language tasks such as machine translation [Cho et al., 2014, Sutskever et al., 2014]. In this work we investigate a Bag-Of-Words (BOW), a CNN, and two RNN variants (LSTM [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] and GRU [Cho et al., 2014]) to encode the question.\n2.3 Combining RNNs and CNNs for description of visual content\nThe task of describing visual content like still images as well as videos has been successfully addressed with a combination of encoding the image with CNNs and decoding, i.e. predicting the sentence description with an RNN [Donahue et al., 2015, Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015, Venugopalan et al., 2015b, Vinyals et al., 2014, Zitnick et al., 2013]. This is achieved by using the RNN model that first gets to observe the visual content and is trained to afterwards predict a sequence of words that is a description of the visual content. Our work extends this idea to question answering, where we formulate a model trained to either generate or classify an answer based on visual as well as natural language input.\n2.4 Grounding of natural language and visual concepts\nDealing with natural language input does involve the association of words with meaning. This is often referred to as the grounding problem - in particular if the “meaning” is associated with a sensory input. While such problems have been historically addressed by symbolic semantic parsing techniques [Krishnamurthy and Kollar, 2013, Matuszek et al., 2012], there is a recent trend of machine learning-based approaches [Kong et al., 2014, Karpathy et al., 2014, Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015, Akata et al., 2016, Hu et al., 2016b, Rohrbach et al., 2015a, Mao et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016, Hu et al., 2016a, Plummer et al., 2016] to find the associations. These approaches have partially been enabled by recently proposed larger scale datasets [Kazemzadeh et al., 2014, Plummer et al., 2015, Yu et al., 2016], providing phrases or referential expressions which are associated with their corresponding image location. Answering questions about images can be interpreted as first grounding the question in the image and then predicting an answer. Our approach thus is similar to the latter approaches in that we do not enforce or evaluate any particular representation of “meaning” on the language or image modality. We treat this as latent and leave it to the joint training approach to establish an appropriate hidden representation to link the visual and textual representations.\n2.5 Textual question answering\nAnswering on purely textual questions has been studied in the NLP community [Berant and Liang, 2014, Liang et al., 2013] and state of the art techniques typically employ semantic parsing to arrive at a logical form capturing the intended meaning and infer relevant answers. Only recently, the success of the previously mentioned neural sequence models, namely RNNs, has carried over to this task [Iyyer et al., 2014, Weston et al., 2014]. More specifically Iyyer et al. [2014] use dependency-tree Recursive NN instead of LSTM, and reduce the question-answering problem to a classification task. Weston et al. [2014] propose different kind of network - memory networks - that is used to answer questions about short stories. In their work, all the parts of the story are embedded into different “memory cells”, and next a network is trained to attend to relevant cells based on the question and decode an answer from that. A similar idea has also been applied to question answering about images, for instance by Yang et al. [2015].\n2.6 Towards a Visual Turing Test\nRecently, a large number architectures have been proposed to approach the Visual Turing Test [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014b], in which they mainly tackle a particularly important subtask that tests machines regarding their abilities to answer to questions about real-world images. Such methods range from symbolic to neural based. There are also architectures that combine both symbolic and neural paradigms together. Some approaches use explicit visual representation in the form of bounding boxes surrounding objects of interest, while other use global full frame image representation, or soft attention mechanism. Yet others use an external knowledge base that helps in answering questions.\nSymbolic based approaches. In our first work towards a Visual Turing Test [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a], we present a question answering system based on a semantic parser on a varied set of human question-answer pairs. Although it is the first attempt to handle question answering on DAQUAR, and despite its introspective benefits, it is a rule-based approach that requires a careful schema crafting, is not that scalable, and finally it strongly depends on the output of visual analysis methods as joint training in this model is not yet possible. Due to such limitations, the community has rather shifted towards either neural based or combined approaches.\nDeep Neural Approaches with full frame CNN. Several contemporary approaches use a global image representation, i.e. they encode the whole image with a CNN. Questions are then encoded with an RNN [Malinowski et al., 2015, Ren et al., 2015, Gao et al., 2015] or a CNN [Ma et al., 2016].\nIn contrast to symbolic based approaches, neural based architectures offer scalable and joint end-to-end training that liberates them from ontological commitment that would otherwise be introduced by a semantic parser. Moreover, such approaches are not ‘hard’ conditioned on the visual input and therefore can naturally take advantage of different language biases in question answer pairs, which can be interpret as learning common sense knowledge.\nAttention-based Approaches. Following Xu et al. [2015], who proposed to use spatial attention for image description, Yang et al. [2015], Xu and Saenko [2015], Zhu et al. [2016], Chen et al. [2015], Shih et al. [2016], Fukui et al. [2016] predict a latent weighting (attention) of spatially localized images features (typically a convolutional layer of the CNN) based on the question. The weighted image representation rather than the full frame feature representation is then used as a basis for answering the question. In contrast to the previous models using attention, Dynamic Memory Networks (DMN) [Kumar et al., 2015, Xiong et al., 2016] first pass all spatial image features through a bi-directional GRU that captures spatial information from the neighboring image patches, and next retrieve an answer from a recurrent attention based neural network that allows to focus only on a subset of the visual features extracted in the first pass. Another interesting direction has been taken by Ilievski et al. [2016] who run state-of-the-art object detector of the classes extracted from the key words in the question. In contrast to other attention mechanisms, this approach offers a focused, question dependent, “hard” attention.\nAnswering with an external knowledge base. Wu et al. [2016] argue for an approach that first represents an image as an intermediate semantic attribute representation, and next query external knowledge sources based on the most prominent attributes and relate them to the question. With the help of such external knowledge bases, this approach captures richer semantic representation of the world, beyond what is directly contained in images.\nCompositional approaches. A different direction is taken by Andreas et al. [2016b,a] who predict the most important components to answer the question with a natural language parser. The components are then mapped to neural modules, which are composed to a deep neural network based on the parse tree. While each question induces a different network, the modules are trained jointly across questions. This work compares to Malinowski and Fritz [2014a] by exploiting explicit assumptions about the compositionality of natural language sentences. Related to the Visual Turing Test, Malinowski and Fritz [2014c] have also combined a neural based representation with the compositionality of the language for the text-to-image retrieval task.\nDynamic parameters. Noh et al. [2015] have an image recognition network and a Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) that dynamically change the parameters (weights) of visual representation based on the question. More precisely, the parameters of its second last layer are dynamically predicted from the question encoder network and in this way changing for each question. While question encoding and image encoding is pre-trained, the network learns parameter prediction only from image-question-answer triples.\n2.7 Datasets for visual question answering\nDatasets are a driving force for the recent progress in visual question answering. A large number of visual question answering datasets have recently been proposed. The first proposed datasets is DAQUAR [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a], which contains about 12.5 thousands manually annotated question-answer pairs about 1449 indoor scenes [Silberman et al., 2012]. While the dataset originally contained a single answer (that can consist of multiple words) per question, in this work we extend the dataset by collecting additional answers for each questions. This captures uncertainties in evaluation. We evaluate our approach on this dataset and discuss several consensus evaluation metrics that take the extended annotations into account. In parallel to our work, Geman et al. [2015] developed another variant of the Visual Turing Test. Their work, however, focuses on sequences of yes/no type of questions, and provides detailed object-scene annotations.\nShortly after the introduction of DAQUAR, three other large-scale datasets have been proposed. All are based on MS-COCO [Lin et al., 2014]. Gao et al. [2015] have annotated about 158k images with 316k Chinese question answer pairs together with their corresponding English translations. Ren et al. [2015] have taken advantage of the existing annotations for the purpose of image description generation task and transform them into question answer pairs with the help of a set of hand-designed rules and a syntactic parser [Klein and Manning, 2003]. This procedure has approximately generated 118k question answer pairs. Finally and currently the most popular, large scale dataset on question answering about images is VQA [Antol et al., 2015]. It has approximately 614k questions about the visual content of about 205k real-world images (the whole VQA dataset also contains 150k questions about 50k abstract scenes that are not considered in this work). Similarly to our Consensus idea, VQA provides 10 answers per each image. For the purpose of the challenge the test answers are not publicly available. We perform one part of the experimental analysis in this paper on the VQA dataset, examining different variants of our proposed approach.\nAlthough simple, automatic performance evaluation metrics have been a part of building first visual question answer-\ning datasets [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a,b, 2015], Yu et al. [2015] have simplified the evaluation even further by introducing Visual Madlibs - a multiple choice question answering by filling the blanks task. In this task, a question answering architecture has to choose one out of four provided answers for a given image and the prompt. Formulating question answering task in this way has wiped out ambiguities in answers, and just a simple accuracy metric can be used to evaluate different architectures on this task. Yet, the task requires holistic reasoning about the images, and despite of simple evaluation, it remains challenging for machines.\nThe Visual7W [Zhu et al., 2016] extends canonical question and answer pairs with additional groundings of all objects appearing in the questions and answers to the image by annotating the correspondences. It contains natural language answers, but also answers which require to locate the object, which is then similar to the task of explicit grounding discussed above. Visual7W builds question answer pairs based on the Visual Genome dataset [Krishna et al., 2016], and contains about 330k questions. In contrast to others such as VQA [Antol et al., 2015] or DAQUAR [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a] that has collected unconstrained question answer pairs, the Visual Genome focuses on the six, so called, Ws: what, where, when, who, why, and how, which can be answered with a natural language answer. An additional 7th question – which – requires a bounding box location as answer. Similarly to Visual Madlibs [Yu et al., 2015], Visual7W also contains multiple-choice answers.\nRelated to Visual Turing Test, Chowdhury et al. [2016] have proposed collective memories and Xplore-M-Ego - a dataset of images with natural language queries, and a media retrieval system. This work focuses on a user centric, dynamic scenario, where the provided answers are conditioned not only on questions but also on the geographical position of the questioner.\nMoving from asking questions about images to questions about video enhances typical questions with temporal structure. Zhu et al. [2015] propose a task which requires to fill in blanks the captions associated with videos. The task requires inferring the past, describing the present and predicting the future in a diverse set of video description data ranging from cooking videos [Regneri et al., 2013] over web videos [Trecvid, 2014] to movies [Rohrbach et al., 2015b]. Tapaswi et al. [2016] propose MovieQA, which requires to understand long term connections in the plot of the movie. Given the difficulty of the data, both works provide multiplechoice answers.\n2.8 Relations to our work\nThe original version of this work [Malinowski et al., 2015] belongs to the category of “Deep Neural Approaches with full frame CNN”, and is among the very first methods of\nthis kind (Section 3.1). We extend [Malinowski et al., 2015] by introducing a more general and modular encoder-decoder perspective (Section 3.2) that encapsulates a few different neural approaches. Next, we broaden our original analysis done on DAQUAR (Section 4) to the analysis of different neural based approaches on VQA showing the importance of getting a few details right together with benefits of a stronger visual encoder (Section 6). Finally, we transfer lessons learnt from VQA [Antol et al., 2015] to DAQUAR [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a], showing a significant improvement on this challenging task (Section 6)."

      "text" : "Answering questions about images can be formulated as the problem of predicting an answer a given an image x and a question q according to a parametric probability measure:\nâ = argmax a∈A\np(a|x, q;θ) (1)\nwhere θ represent a vector of all parameters to learn and A is a set of all answers. The question q is a sequence of words, i.e. q = [q1, . . . , qn], where each qt is the t-th word question with qn = “?” encoding the question mark - the end of the question. In the following we describe how we represent x, a, q, and p(·|x, q;θ) in more details.\nIn a scenario of multiple word answers, we consequently decompose the problem to predicting a set of answer words aq,x = { a1,a2, ...,aN (q,x) } , where at are words from a finite vocabulary V ′, and N (q, x) is the number of answer words for the given question and image. In our approach, named Ask Your Neurons, we propose to tackle the problem as follows. To predict multiple words we formulate the problem as predicting a sequence of words from the vocabulary V := V ′ ∪ {$} where the extra token $ indicates the end of the answer sequence, and points out that the question has been fully answered. We thus formulate the prediction procedure recursively:\nât = argmax a∈V\np(a|x, q, Ât−1;θ) (2)\nwhere Ât−1 = {â1, . . . , ât−1} is the set of previous words, with Â0 = {} at the beginning, when our approach has not given any answer word so far. The approach is terminated when ât = $. We evaluate the method solely based on the predicted answer words ignoring the extra token $. To ensure uniqueness of the predicted answer words, as we want to predict the set of answer words, the prediction procedure can be be trivially changed by maximizing over V \\ Ât−1. However, in practice, our algorithm learns to not predict any previously predicted words.\nIf we only have single word answers, or if we model each multi-word answer as a different answer (i.e. vocabulary entry), we use Equation 1 only once to pick the most likely answer.\nIn the following we first present a Ask Your Neurons that models multi-word answers with a single recurrent network for question and image encoding and answer prediction (Section 3.1) and then present a more general and modular framework with question and image encoders, as well as answer decoder as modules (Section 3.2).\n3.1 Method\nAs shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we feed our approach Ask Your Neurons with a question as a sequence of words. Since our problem is formulated as a variable-length inputoutput-sequence, we decide to model the parametric distribution p(·|x, q;θ) of Ask Your Neurons with a recurrent neural network and a softmax prediction layer. More precisely, Ask Your Neurons is a deep network built of CNN [LeCun et al., 1998] and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997]. We decide on LSTM as it has been recently shown to be effective in learning a variable-length sequence-to-sequence mapping [Donahue et al., 2015, Sutskever et al., 2014].\nBoth question and answer words are represented with one-hot vector encoding (a binary vector with exactly one non-zero entry at the position indicating the index of the word in the vocabulary) and embedded in a lower dimensional space, using a jointly learnt latent linear embedding. In the training phase, we augment the question words sequence q with the corresponding ground truth answer words sequence a, i.e. q̂ := [q,a]. During the test time, in the prediction phase, at time step t, we augment q with previously predicted answer words â1..t := [â1, . . . , ât−1], i.e. q̂t := [q, â1..t]. This means the question q and the previous answer words are encoded implicitly in the hidden states of the LSTM, while the latent hidden representation is learnt.

      "text" : "As visualized in detail in Figure 3, the LSTM unit takes an input vector vt at each time step t and predicts an output word zt which is equal to its latent hidden state ht. As discussed above, zt is a linear embedding of the corresponding answer word at. In contrast to a simple RNN unit, the LSTM unit additionally maintains a memory cell c. This allows to learn long-term dynamics more easily and significantly reduces the vanishing and exploding gradients problem [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997]. More precisely, we use the LSTM unit as described in Zaremba and Sutskever [2014]. With the sigmoid nonlinearity σ : R 7→ [0, 1], σ(v) = (1 + e−v)−1 and the hyperbolic tangent nonlinearity φ : R 7→ [−1, 1], φ(v) = ev−e−vev+e−v = 2σ(2v) − 1, the LSTM updates for time step t given inputs vt, ht−1, and the memory cell ct−1 as follows:\nit = σ(Wvivt +Whiht−1 + bi) (3)\nf t = σ(Wvfvt +Whfht−1 + bf ) (4)\not = σ(Wvovt +Whoht−1 + bo) (5)\ngt = φ(Wvgvt +Whght−1 + bg) (6)\nct = f t ct−1 + it gt (7) ht = ot φ(ct) (8)\nwhere denotes element-wise multiplication.

As Figures 1 and 2 suggest, all the output predictions that occur before the question mark are excluded from the loss computation, so that the model is penalized solely based on the predicted answer words.\nQuestion Encoder\nVisual Encoder C Answer Decoder\nFig. 4 Our Refined Ask Your Neurons architecture for answering questions about images that includes the following modules: visual and question encoders, and answer decoder. A multimodal embedding C combines both encodings into a joint space that the decoder decodes from. See Section 3.2 for details.\n3.2 Refined Ask Your Neurons\nIn the previous section, we have described how to achieve visual question answering with a single recurrent network for question and image encoding and answering. In this section, we abstract away from the particular design choices taken and describe a modular framework, where a question encoder has to be combined with a visual encoder in order to produce answers with an answer decoder (Figure 4). This modular representation allows us to systematically investigate and evaluate a range of design choices of different encoders, multimodal embeddings, and decoders."

      "text" : "The main goal of a question encoder is to capture a meaning of the question, which we write here as Ψ(q). Such an encoder can range from a very structured ones like Semantic Parser used in Malinowski and Fritz [2014a] and Liang et al. [2013] that explicitly model compositional nature of the question, to orderless Bag-Of-Word (BOW) approaches that merely compute a histogram over the question words (Figure 6). In this work, we investigate a few encoders within such spectrum that are compatible with the proposed Deep Learning approach: Two recurrent question encoders, LSTM [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997] (see Section 3.1.1) and GRU [Cho et al., 2014], that assume a temporal ordering in questions, as well as the aforementioned BOW.\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU).

Accordingly, each feature vector in fI corresponds to a 32⇥ 32 pixel region of the input images. We denote by fi, i 2 [0, 195] the feature vector of each image region.\nThen for modeling convenience, we use a single layer perceptron to transform each feature vector to a new vector that has the same dimension as the question vector (described in Sec. 3.2):\nvI = tanh(WIfI + bI), (2)\nwhere vI is a matrix and its i-th column vi is the visual feature vector for the region indexed by i.\n3.2.

A forget gate ft controls how much information from past state ct 1 is preserved. An input gate it controls how much the current input xt updates the memory cell. An output gate ot controls how much information of the memory is fed to the output as hidden state.

The weight matrix and bias are parameters of the LSTM and are learned on training data.\nunigram bigram\ntrigram max pooling over time\nconvolution\nw hat are sitting bicycle …Question:\nembedding\nFigure 4: CNN based question model\nIn this study, we also explore to use a CNN similar to [11] for question representation. Similar to the LSTMbased question model, we first embed words to vectors xt = Weqt and get the question vector by concatenating the word vectors:\nx1:T = [x1, x2, ..., xT ]. (10)\nThen we apply convolution operation on the word embedding vectors. We use three convolution filters, which have the size of one (unigram), two (bigram) and three (trigram) respectively. The t-th convolution output using window size c is given by:\nhc,t = tanh(Wcxt:t+c 1 + bc). (11)\nThe filter is applied only to window t : t + c 1 of size c. Wc is the convolution weight and bc is the bias. The feature map of the filter with convolution size c is given by:\nhc = [hc,1, hc,2, ..., hc,T c+1]. (12)\nThen we apply max-pooling over the feature maps of the convolution size c and denote it as\nh̃c = max t [hc,1, hc,2, ..., hc,T c+1]. (13)\nBag-Of-Word (BOW). Conceptually the simplest encoder, the BOW approach (Figure 6) sums over the words embeddings:\nΨBOW(q) := n∑ t We(qt). (13)\nwhereW e is a m trix and qt is one-hot binary vector of the word with exactly one 1 pointing to a place of the ’word’ in the vocabulary (Figure 6). BOW does not encode the ordering of words in the question, so that especially questions with swapped arguments of spatial prepositions become indistinguishable, i.e. ΨBOW(red chair left of sofa) = ΨBOW(red sofa left of chair) in the BOW sentence representation.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been proposed to encode language [Kim, 2014, Kalchbrenner et al., 2014, Ma et al., 2016, Yang et al., 2015] and since have shown to be fast to compute and result in good accuracy. Since they consider a larger context, they arguably maintain more structure than BOW, but do not model such long term dependencies as recurrent neural networks. Figure 5 depicts our CNN architecture, which is very similar to Ma et al. [2016] and Yang et al. [2015], that convolves word embeddings with three convolutional kernels of length 1, 2 and 3. For the sake of clarity, we only show two kernels in the figure. We either learn them jointly with the whole model or use GLOVE [Pennington et al., 2014] in our experiments. We call such architecture with 1, ..., n kernel lengths n views CNN. At the end, the kernel’s outputs are temporarily aggregated for the final question’s representation. We use either sum pooling or a recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) to accomplish this step."

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art framework that provide features from images. The typical protocol of using the visual models is to first pre-train them on the ImageNet dataset [Russakovsky et al., 2014], a large scale recognition dataset, and next use them as an input for the rest of the architecture. Fine-tuning the weights of the encoder to the task at hand is also possible. In our experiments, we use chronologically the oldest CNN architecture fully trained on ImageNet – a Caffe implementation of AlexNet [Jia et al., 2014, Krizhevsky et al., 2012] – as well as the recently introduced deeper networks – Caffe implementations of GoogLeNet and VGG [Szegedy et al., 2014, Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014] – to the most recent extremely deep architectures – a Facebook implementation of 152 layered ResidualNet [He et al., 2015].

In addition, in Section 4.2, we analyze how well questions can be answered without using the image in order to gain an understanding of biases in form of prior knowledge and common sense. We provide a new human baseline for this task. In Section 4.3 we discuss ambiguities in the question answering tasks and analyze them further by introducing metrics that are sensitive to these phenomena. In particular, the WUPS score [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a] is extended to a consensus metric that considers multiple human answers.

We evaluate our approach from Section 3 on the DAQUAR dataset [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a], which provides 12, 468 human question answer pairs on images of indoor scenes [Silberman et al., 2012] and follow the same evaluation protocol by providing results on accuracy and the WUPS score at {0.9, 0.0}. We run experiments for the full dataset as well as their proposed reduced set that restricts the output space to only 37 object categories and uses 25 test images. In addition, we also evaluate the methods on different subsets of DAQUAR where only 1, 2, 3 or 4 word answers are present.\nWe use default hyper-parameters of LSTM [Donahue et al., 2015] and CNN [Jia et al., 2014]. All CNN models are first pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset [Russakovsky et al., 2014], and next we randomly initialize and train the last layer together with the LSTM network on the task. We find this step crucial to obtain good results. We have explored the use of a 2 layered LSTM model, but have consistently obtained worse performance. In a pilot study, we have found that GoogleNet architecture [Jia et al., 2014, Szegedy et al., 2014] consistently outperforms the AlexNet architecture [Jia et al., 2014, Krizhevsky et al., 2012] as a CNN model for our task and model.\nWUPS scores. We base our experiments and the consensus metrics on WUPS scores [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a]. The metric is a generalization of the accuracy measure that accounts for word-level ambiguities in the answer words. For instance ‘carton’ and ‘box’ can be associated with a similar concept, and hence models should not be strongly penalized for this type of mistakes. Formally:\nWUPS(A, T ) = 1\nN N∑ i=1 min{ ∏ a∈Ai max t∈T i µ(a, t),\n∏ t∈T i max a∈Ai µ(a, t)}\nTo embrace the aforementioned ambiguities, Malinowski and Fritz [2014a] suggest using a thresholded taxonomy-based\nWu-Palmer similarity [Wu and Palmer, 1994] for µ. Smaller thresholds yield more forgiving metrics. As in Malinowski and Fritz [2014a], we report WUPS at two extremes, 0.0 and 0.9.\n4.1 Evaluation of Ask Your Neurons\nWe start with the evaluation of our Ask Your Neurons on the full DAQUAR dataset in order to study different variants and training conditions. Afterwards we evaluate on the reduced DAQUAR for additional points of comparison to prior work.\nResults on full DAQUAR. Table 1 shows the results of our Ask Your Neurons method on the full set (“multiple words”) with 653 images and 5673 question-answer pairs available at test time. In addition, we evaluate a variant that is trained to predict only a single word (“single word”) as well as a variant that does not use visual features (“Question-only”). Note, however, that “single word” refers to a training procedure. All the methods in Table 1 are evaluated on the full DAQUAR dataset at test time that also contains multi-word answers. In comparison to the prior work [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a] (shown in the first row in Table 1), we observe strong improvements of over 9% points in accuracy and over 11% in the WUPS scores (second row in Table 1 that corresponds to “multiple words”). Note that, we achieve this improvement despite the fact that the only published number available for the comparison on the full set uses ground truth object annotations [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a] – which puts our method at a disadvantage. Further improvements are observed when we train only on a single word answer, which doubles the accuracy obtained in prior work. We attribute this to a joint training of the language and visual representations and the dataset bias, where about 90% of the answers contain only a single word.\nWe further analyze this effect in Figure 7, where we show performance of our approach (“multiple words”) in dependence on the number of words in the answer (truncated at 4 words due to the diminishing performance). The performance of the “single word” variants on the one-word subset are shown as horizontal lines. Although accuracy drops rapidly for longer answers, our model is capable of producing a significant number of correct two words answers. The “single word” variants have an edge on the single answers and benefit from the dataset bias towards these type of answers. Quantitative results of the “single word” model on the one-word answers subset of DAQUAR are shown in Table 2. While we have made substantial progress compared to prior work, there is still a 30% points margin to human accuracy and 25 in WUPS score (“Human answers” in Table 1).\nLater on, in Section 7, we will show improved results on DAQUAR with a stronger visual model and a pre-trained word embedding, with ADAM [Kingma and Ba, 2014] as\nAccu- WUPS WUPS racy @0.9 @0.0\nAsk Your Neurons (ours) 21.67 27.99 65.11\nQuestion-only (ours) 19.13 25.16 61.51\nTable 2 Results of the single word model on the one-word answers subset of DAQUAR, all classes, single reference, in %.\n1 2 3 4\n0\n10\n20\n30\nWords number\nA cc\nur ac\ny\n1 2 3 4\n0\n10\n20\n30\nWords number\nW U\nPS 0.\n9\nFig. 7 Question-only (blue bar) and Ask Your Neurons (red bar) “multi word” models evaluated on different subsets of DAQUAR.

We also put the method in a broader context, and compare with other approaches.\nResults on reduced DAQUAR. In order to provide performance numbers that are comparable to the proposed MultiWorld approach in Malinowski and Fritz [2014a], we also run our method on the reduced set with 37 object classes and only 25 images with 297 question-answer pairs at test time.\nTable 3 shows that Ask Your Neurons also improves on the reduced DAQUAR set, achieving 34.68% Accuracy and 40.76% WUPS at 0.9 substantially outperforming Malinowski and Fritz [2014a] by 21.95 percent points of Accuracy and 22.6 WUPS points. Similarly to previous experiments, we achieve the best performance using the “single word” variant of our method. Note that Ren et al. [2015] reported 36.94%, 48.15%, and 82.68% Accuracy, WUPS at 0.9, and WUPS at 0.0 respectively. However, they use another variant of our reduced DAQUAR dataset, where all the multiple word answers are removed. This roughly accounts for 98% of the original reduced DAQUAR dataset.\n4.2 Answering questions without looking at images\nIn order to study how much information is already contained in questions, we train a version of our model that ignores the visual input. The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 3 under “Question-only (ours)”. The best “Question-only” models with 17.15% and 32.32% compare very well in terms of accuracy to the best models that include vision.

It turns out that humans can guess the correct answer in 7.86% of the cases by exploiting prior knowledge and common sense. Interestingly, our best “Question-only” model outperforms the human baseline by over 9 percent points. A substantial number of answers are plausible and resemble a form of common sense knowledge employed by humans to infer answers without having seen the image.\n4.3 Human Consensus\nWe observe that in many cases there is an inter human agreement in the answers for a given image and question and this is also reflected by the human baseline performance on the question answering task of 50.20% (“Human answers” in Table 1). We study and analyze this effect further by extending our dataset to multiple human reference answers in Section 4.3.1, and proposing a new measure – inspired by the work in psychology [Cohen et al., 1960, Fleiss and Cohen, 1973, Nakashole et al., 2013] – that handles agreement in Section 4.3.2, as well as conducting additional experiments in Section 4.3.3."

Figure 8 shows the fraction of the data where the answers agree between all available questions (“100”), at least 50% of the available questions and do not agree at all (no agreement - “0”). We observe that for the majority of the data, there is a partial agreement, but even full disagreement is possible. We split the dataset into three parts according to the above criteria “No agreement”, “≥ 50% agreement” and “Full agreement” and evaluate our models on these splits (Table 4 summarizes the results). On subsets with stronger agreement, we achieve substantial gains of up to 10% and 20% points in accuracy over the full set (Table 1) and the Subset: No agreement (Table 4), respectively.

It cooperates well with WUPS at 0.9, which takes word ambiguities into account, gaining an 18% higher score.\n4.4 Qualitative results\nWe show predicted answers of different architecture variants in Tables 19, 20, and 21. We chose the examples to highlight differences between Ask Your Neurons and the “Questiononly”. We use a “multiple words” approach only in Table 20, otherwise the “single word” model is shown. Despite some failure cases, “Question-only” makes “reasonable guesses” like predicting that the largest object could be table or an object that could be found on the bed is a pillow or doll.\nFig. 9 Figure showing correlation between question and answer words of the “Question-only” model (at x-axis), and a similar correlation of the “Human-baseline” [Malinowski and Fritz, 2014a] (at y-axis).\n4.5 Failure cases\nWhile our method answers correctly on a large part of the challenge (e.g.≈ 35 WUPS at 0.9 on “what color” and “how many” question subsets), spatial relations (≈ 21 WUPS at 0.9) which account for a substantial part of DAQUAR remain challenging. Other errors involve questions with small objects, negations, and shapes (below 12 WUPS at 0.9). Too few training data points for the aforementioned cases may contribute to these mistakes. Table 21 shows examples of failure cases that include (in order) strong occlusion, a possible answer not captured by our ground truth answers, and unusual instances (red toaster).\n4.6 Common Sense Knowledge\nAlthough “Question-only” ignores the image, it is still able to make “reasonable guesses” by exploiting biases captured by the dataset. Some of such biases we interpret as a type of a common sense knowledge. For instance, “tea kettle” often sits on the oven, cabinets are usually “brown”, “chair” is typically placed in front of a table, and we commonly keep a “photo” on a cabinet (Table 22, 24, 25, 28). On the other hand, some other biases are hardly related to the common sense knowledge. For instance, “11” as the answer to the question “How many bottles are on the desk?” or a “clock” as the answer to the question “what is the black and white object on the top right of the brown board?”. This effect is analysed in Figure 9. Each data point in the plot represents the correlation between a question and a predicted answer words for our “Question-only” model (x-axis) versus the correlation in the human answers (y-axis). Despite the reasonable guesses of the “Question-only” architecture, the “Ask Your Neurons” predicts in average better answers (shown in Table 1). For instance in Table 26 the “Questiononly” model incorrectly answers “6” on the question “How\nmany burner knobs are there ?” because it has seen only this answer during the training with exactly the same question but on different image."

      "heading" : "5 Extended Experiments on DAQUAR",
      "text" : "In this section, we first extend our experiments with other baseline methods, and next, guided by our findings on VQA shown in Section 7, we show the results with the refined model in the context of a larger body of results on DAQUAR.\nBaseline methods. To gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of our neural-based approach, we relate the obtained results to other baseline techniques. Similar baselines were also introduced in Antol et al. [2015] and Ren et al. [2015], although they target either a different dataset or another variant of DAQUAR. The Constant technique uses the most frequent answer in the training set to answer to every question in the test set. In Constant, per question type, we first break all questions into a few categories and then use the most frequent answer per category to answer to every question in that category at the test time. Table 7 provides more details on the chosen categories. Look-up table builds a hash map from a textual question into the most frequent answer for that question at the training time. At the test time, the method just looks up the answer for the question in the hashmap. If the question exists then the most popular answer for that question is provided, otherwise an ‘empty’ answer is given. In addition, we also remove articles, such as ‘the’ and ‘a’, from all the questions. However, this brings only a minor improvement. Finally, we experiment with two nearestneighbor methods. Both methods rely on a Bag-of-Words representation of questions, where every question word is encoded by GLOVE [Pennington et al., 2014]. In the following, we call this the representation the semantic space. Nearest Neighbor, Question-only searches at test time for the most similar question in the semantic space from the training set. Then it takes the answer that corresponds to this question. Nearest Neighbor is inspired by a similar baseline introduced in Antol et al. [2015]. At the test time we first search for the 4 most similar questions in the semantic space available in the training set. Next, we form candidate images that correspond to the aforementioned 4 questions. At the last step, we choose an answer that is associated with the best match in the visual space. The latter is done by a cosine similarity between global CNN representations of the test image and every candidate image. We experiment with several CNN representations (VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet152) but to our surprise there is little performance difference between them. We decide to use GoogLeNet as the results are slightly better.\nBaseline results. Constant shows how the dataset is biased w.r.t. the most frequent answer. This answer turns out to be the number “2”, which also explain a good performance of Ask Your Neurons on the “how many” question subset in DAQUAR. Constant, per question type shows that question types provide quite strong clues for answering questions. Kafle and Kanan [2016] take advantage of such clues in their Bayesian and Hybrid models (in Table 9, we only show a better performing Hybrid model). Our next baseline, Lookup table can be seen as an extreme case of the Constant, per question type model. It also gives surprisingly good results even though it cannot answer to novel questions. This result also confirms our intuitions that “Question-only” biases are important in the ‘question answering about images’ datasets. Finally, next nearest-neighbor baselines show that a visual representation still helps.\nState-of-the-Art. Based on our further analysis on VQA (for more details we refer to Section 6 and Section 7), we have also applied the improved model to DAQUAR, and we significantly outperform Malinowski et al. [2015] presented in Section 4. In the experiments, we first choose last 10% of training set as a validation set in order to determine a number of training epochs K, and next we train the model for K epochs. We evaluate model on two variants of DAQUAR: all data points (‘all’ in Table 9), and a subset (‘single word’ in Table 9) containing only single word answers, which consists of about 90% of the original dataset. As Table 9 shows, our model, Vision + Language with GLOVE and Residual Net that sums visual and question representations, outperforms the model of Malinowski et al. [2015] by 5.05, 4.50, 0.80 of Accuracy, WUPS at 0.9, and WUPS at 0.0 respectively. This shows how important a strong visual model is, as well as the aforementioned details used in training. Likewise to our conclusions on VQA, we are also observing an improvement with attention based models (comparison in Attention and Global sections in Table 9)."

      "text" : "While Section 4 analyses our original architecture [Malinowski et al., 2015] on the DAQUAR dataset, in this section, we analyze different variants and design choices for neural question answering on the large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset [Antol et al., 2015]. It is currently one of the largest and most popular visual question answering dataset with human question answer pairs. In the following, after describing the experimental setup (Section 6.1), we first describe several experiments which examine the different variants of question encoding, only looking at language input to predict the answer (Section 6.1), and then, we examine the full model (Section 6.3).\n6.1 Experimental setup\nWe evaluate on the VQA dataset [Antol et al., 2015], which is built on top of the MS-COCO dataset [Lin et al., 2014]. Although VQA offers a different challenge tasks, we focus our efforts on the Real Open-Ended Visual Question Answering challenge. The challenge consists of 10 answers per question with about 248k training questions, about 122k validation questions, and about 244k test questions.\nAs VQA consist mostly of single word answers (over 89%), we treat the question answering problem as a classifi-\ncation problem of the most frequent answers in the training set. For the evaluation of the different model variants and design choices, we train on the training set and test on the validation set. Only the final evaluations (Table 17) are evaluated on the test set of the VQA challenge, we evaluate on both parts test-dev and test-standard, where the answers are not publicly available. As a performance measure we use a consensus variant of accuracy introduced in Antol et al. [2015], where the predicted answer gets score between 0 and 1, with 1 if it matches with at least three human answers. We use ADAM [Kingma and Ba, 2014] throughout our ex-\nkernel length single view multi view k = k ≤ k\n1 47.43 47.43 2 48.11 48.06 3 48.26 48.09 4 48.27 47.86\nperiments as we found out it performs better than SGD with momentum. We keep default hyper-parameters for ADAM. Employed Recurrent Neural Networks maps input question into 500 dimensional vector representation. All the CNNs for text are using 500 feature maps in our experiments, but the output dimensionality also depends on the number of views. In preliminary experiments, we found that removing question mark ‘?’ in the questions slightly improves the results, and we report the numbers only with this setting. Since VQA has 10 answers associated with each question, we need to consider a suitable training strategy that takes this into account. We have examined the following strategies: (1) picking an answer randomly, (2) randomly but if possible annotated as confidently answered, (3) all answers, or (4) choosing the most frequent answer. In the following, we only report the results using the last strategy as we have found out little difference in accuracy between the strategies. To allow training and evaluating many different models with limited time and computational power, we do not fine-tune the visual representations in these experiments, although our model would allow us to do so. All the models, which are publicly available together with our tutorial [Malinowski and Fritz, 2016] 2, are implemented in Keras [Chollet, 2015] and Theano [Bastien et al., 2012].\n6.2 Question-only\nWe start our analysis from “Question-only” models that do not use images to answer on questions. Note that the “Questiononly” baselines play an important role in the question answering about images tasks since how much performance is\n2 https://github.com/mateuszmalinowski/ visual_turing_test-tutorial\ntop frequent answers Encoder 1000 2000 3000\nBOW 47.91 48.13 47.94 CNN 48.53 48.67 48.57 LSTM 48.58 48.86 48.65\nTable 12 Results on VQA validation set, “Question-only” model: Analysis of the number of top frequent answer classes, with different question encoders.

To understand better different design choices, we have conducted our analysis along the different ‘design’ dimensions."

We also tried to run simultaneously a few kernels with different lengths. In Table 10 (right column) one view corresponds to a kernel length 1, two views correspond to two kernels with length 1 and 2, three views correspond to length 1, 2 and 3, etc. However, we find that the best performance still achieve with a single view and kernel length 3 or 4."

Surprisingly, such a simple approach gives very competitive results (first row in Table 11) compared to the CNN encoding discussed in the previous section (second row).\nRecurrent questions encoder.

To address such shortcoming, we investigate the pre-trained word embedding transformation GLOVE [Pennington et al., 2014] that encodes question words (technically it maps one-hot vector into a 300 dimensional real vector). This choice naturally extends the vocabulary of the question words to about 2 million words extracted a large corpus of web data – Common Crawl [Pennington et al., 2014] – that is used to train the GLOVE embedding. Since the BOW architecture in this scenario becomes shallow (only classification weights are learnt), we add an extra hidden layer between pooling and classification (without this embedding, accuracy drops by 5%). Table 11 (right column) summarizes our experiments with GLOVE. For all question encoders, the word embedding consistently improves performance which confirms that using a word embedding model learnt from a larger corpus helps. LSTM benefits most from GLOVE embedding, archiving the overall best performance with 48.58% accuracy."

We can see that on one hand methods that use contextual language information such as CNN and LSTM are performing better, on the other hand adding strong vision becomes crucial. Furthermore, we use the best found models to run experiments on the VQA test sets: test-dev2015 and teststandard. To prevent overfitting, the latter restricts the number of submissions to 1 per day and 5 submissions in total. Here, we also study the effect of larger datasets where first we train only on the training set, and next we train for 20 epochs on a joint, training and validation, set. When we train on the join set, we consider question answer pairs with answers among 2000 the most frequent answer classes from the training and validation sets. Training on the joint set have gained us about 0.9%. This implies that on one hand having more data indeed helps, but arguably we also need better models that exploit the current training datasets more effectively.

Table 18 compares our Refined Ask Your Neurons model with other approaches. Some methods, likewise to our approach, use global image representation, other attention mechanism, yet other dynamically predict question dependent weights, external textual sources, or fuse compositional question’s representation with neural networks. Table 18 shows a few trends. First of all, a better visual representation significantly helps (Table 15). Most of the leading approaches to VQA also uses variants of ResNet, which is among the strongest approaches to the image classification task. It is, however, important to normalize the visual features (Table 13). Additionally, all the best models use an explicit attention mechanism (e.g. DMN+, FDA, SAN, POSTECH, MCB, HieCoAtt)\nIn this work, however, we focus on the extension of the plain “Ask Your Neurons” model that uses a global, fullframe image representation. A similar representation is used in Refined Ask Your Neurons, iBOWIMG, VQA team, and LSTM Q+I. The best performing approaches also use different variants of the Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM and GRU are the most popular). Such a question encoding outperforms Bag-of-Words representations (iBOWIMG in Table 18, and BOW in Table 14). As we hypothesize, a multimodal embedding plays an important role. This is not only shown in Table 13, but also emphasized in two leading approaches to VQA (MCB and SNUBI). Both methods use novel multimodal embedding techniques that build upon the element-wise multiplication. Finally, using external textual resources also seems to be beneficial (AMA)."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "We have presented a neural architecture for answering natural language questions about images that contrasts with prior efforts based on semantic parsing and outperforms a prior symbolic based approach by doubling performance on this challenging task. A variant of our model, that does not use the image to answer the question, already explains a substantial part of the overall performance and helps to understand the contribution of the visual features in this task. From a comparison with the human baseline where humans are not\nshown the image to answer the question, we conclude that this language-only model has learnt biases and patterns that can be seen as forms of common sense and prior knowledge that are also used by humans to accomplish this task. We have extended our existing DAQUAR dataset to the new DAQUAR-Consensus, which now provides multiple reference answers which allows to study inter-human agreement and consensus on the question answering task. We propose two new metrics: “Average Consensus”, which takes into account human disagreement, and “Min Consensus” that captures disagreement in human question answering. Finally, we extend our analysis to the large-scale VQA dataset showing competitive performance, yet still using global visual model, and training the model solely on the provided question answer image triples. A broader analysis of the different Deep Learning components and design choices in our model has led to improved results and highlights the importance of a strong visual model.\nAcknowledgements Marcus Rohrbach was supported by a fellowship within the FITweltweit-Program of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD).

We experiment with several CNN representations (VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet152) but to our surprise there is little performance difference between them. We decide to use GoogLeNet as the results are slightly better. Baseline results. Constant shows how the dataset is biased w.r.t. the most frequent answer. This answer turns out to be the number “2”, which also explain a good performance of Ask Your Neurons on the “how many” question subset in DAQUAR.

We evaluate our approaches on the DAQUAR as well as the VQA dataset where we also report various baselines, including an analysis how much information is contained in the language part only. To study human consensus, we propose two novel metrics and collect additional answers which extend the original DAQUAR dataset to DAQUAR-Consensus.
