      "text" : "The predictability of symbols in strings is the most fundamental concept of information encoding in general, and natural language production in particular. Shannon [29] defined the entropy - or average information content as a\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n06 99\n6v 1\nmeasure of uncertainty or “choice” inherent to strings of symbols. Since then, Shannon [28] and others have undertaken great efforts to estimate precisely the entropy of written English [4, 12, 8, 27], and other languages [1, 17, 18].\nIn computational linguistics, entropy - and related measures - have been widely applied to tackle problems relating to machine translation [2, 20], distributional semantics [10, 22, 26, 25], information retrieval [3, 30, 16], and multiword expressions [33, 24]. All these accounts crucially hinge upon estimating the probability and uncertainty associated with words - i.e. the word entropy - in a given text and language.\nThere are two central questions associated with this estimation: 1) what is the text size (in number of tokens) at which word entropies converge to a stable value? 2) How much systematic difference in word entropies do we find across different languages? The first question is related to the problem of data sparsity. The performance of NLP tools relying on word probabilities is lower-bounded by the minimum text size at which word entropies can still be reliably estimated. The second question relates to the applicability of NLP tools across different languages. The performance of a single tool can be systematically biased in a specific language due to generally higher or lower word entropies.\nIn this study, we use a state-of-the-art method to estimate block entropies [19], and also implement a source entropy estimator [8]. This allows us to establish word entropy convergence points for parallel texts of up to 30M tokens in 21 languages. Based on these analyses, we select texts with sufficiently large token counts from a massively parallel corpus and estimate word entropies across 1360 texts and 1001 languages."

      "heading" : "2 Motivation",
      "text" : "A fundamental property of words is their frequency of occurrence, and hence their probability in language production. This probability is at the heart of many applications in natural language processing.\nFor example, the probability of an expert translating the English word the into German der can be estimated as\np̂(der|the) = p̂(der, the)/p̂(the). (1)\nThis is the conditional probability of finding der in a word aligned German translation where we have the in the English original. More generally, we\ncould have a set of possible German translations\nS = {der, die, das, dem, den, des} (2)\nassigned with estimated probabilities:\np̂(der) + p̂(die) + p̂(das) + p̂(dem) + p̂(den) + p̂(des) = 1. (3)\nIn the uniform case, all of these are assigned probability 1/6, and there is maximum uncertainty about which German word corresponds to English the. In the clearest case, one of the probabilities is 1 and the others are 0. The entropy over such a distribution of word probabilities measures exactly this uncertainty or “choice”. In our example of German articles, the word entropy is ≈ 2.6 in the uniform case and 0 in the clear case. Entropy calculation is detailed below (Section 4)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1 Entropy in statistical machine translation",
      "text" : "Given the example above, the task of a machine translation system is to map the English word the onto the correct choice from the set of German translations. The maximum entropy approach [2], for instance, requires that the probabilities are estimated as accurately as possible from the given training data. Probabilities which cannot be estimated reliably are then chosen in a way to maximize the overall entropy of the model.\nCrucially, the translation difficulty in such an account is a direct function of the entropy of the word distribution. In the English-to-German mapping - with uniform probabilities - there are 2.6 bits of “choice”, whereas in the German-to-English mapping there are 0 bits of “choice”.\nThis is closely related to Koehn’s [11] finding that when translating into English from 10 different source languages, BLEU scores negatively correlate with the number of words in the source language. Hence, it is a harder problem to translate into a language with higher word entropies than to translate into a language with lower word entropies - everything else being equal. From this perspective, estimating the entropy of word distributions can help to predict translation performance."

      "heading" : "2.2 Entropy in distributional semantics",
      "text" : "Measures of semantic content and similarity [25, 26, 22, 10] often also rely on information-theoretic concepts. For example, the classical study by Resnik [25] defines the similarity between two concepts c1 and c2 in a semantic hierarchy as\nsim(c1, c2) = max c ∈ S(c1,c2)\n[−log p(c)], (4)\nwith S(c1, c2) being the set of concepts which subsume both c1 and c2. To get the information content −log p(c), the probability of a shared concept p(c) is estimated from corpus data as\np̂(c) = freq(c)/N, (5)\nwhere freq(c) is the count of word tokens (nouns in this case) per concept (e.g. occurrences of dollar, euro, and coin would count towards the frequency of the concept money), and N is the overall number of word tokens observed. Note that via the estimated p̂(c) this similarity measure depends on the overall distribution of word probabilities, i.e. the word entropy. Namely, for a language with more word types of overall lower token frequencies the probability p̂(c) is biased to be lower on average, and hence the information content −log p(c) is biased to be higher.\nSimilar considerations apply to finding hypernyms in vector spaces [26], measuring semantic content to establish asymmetries between derived words and their base forms [22], as well as measuring differences in semantic content to establish hyponym-hypernym relations [10].\nOverall, estimating a) the convergence points (in number of word tokens), and b) reliable approximations for word entropies are crucial prerequisites for understanding the performance of translation systems, semantic similarity measures, and more generally, any NLP tool that relies on probabilities of words.\nThese estimations are also relevant for efforts to broaden the scope of NLP to lesser known languages [14, 21, 23, 7], and to establish quantitative and corpus-based methods in linguistic typology [6, 32, 31]."

However, in computational linguistics, word tokens are are a common working unit.\nA word token is here defined as a string of alphanumeric UTF-8 characters delimited by white spaces, with all letters converted to lower case and punctuation removed. Note that scripts of Mandarin Chinese (cmn) and Khmer (khm), for instance, delimit phrases and sentences by white spaces, rather than words. However, such scripts constitute a negligible proportion of our sample (≈ 0.01%). In fact, ≈ 90% of the texts are written in Latin script.\nGiven words as basic information encoding units, we can estimate the word entropy as outlined in the following."

Word type probabilities are distributed according to p(w) = Pr(T = w) for w ∈ V . Given these definitions, the entropy of T can be calculated as [29]\nH(T ) = − V∑ i=1 p(wi) log2(p(wi)).

Take the first verse of the English Bible as a text.\nin the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and the earth was waste and empty [...]\nIn this example, the word type the occurs 4 times, and occurs 3 times, etc. As a simple approximation, p(wi) can be estimated via the maximum likelihood method:\np̂(wi) = fi∑V j=1 fj , (5)\nwhere the denominator is the overall number of word tokens. For the Bible verse we would thus have:\nH(T ) = −( 4 17 log2( 4 17 ) + 3 17 log2( 3 17 ) + . . . + 1 17 log2( 1 17 )) ≈ 3.2 (6)\nHowever, there are two main caveats with this so-called plug-in approach: Firstly, it has been shown that the maximum likelihood estimator is unreliable, especially for small text sizes [19, 9], i.e. small ∑V\nj=1 fj. A range of remedies have been proposed to overcome this problem [27, 19, 9, 13].\nSecondly, estimating the entropy from raw counts assumes that word tokens are drawn independently from a multinomial distribution, meaning\nthere are no dependencies between words. Clearly, this requirement is not met for natural languages [13].\nTo overcome this problem, instead of using unigrams as “blocks” of information encoding, we could use bigrams, trigrams, n-grams, and thus increase block sizes to 2, 3, n. This yields block entropies [27] defined as\nHn(T ) = − V∑ i=1 p(wi, wi+1, ..., wn)× log2(p(wi, wi+1, ..., wn)), (6)\nwhere n is the block size. If n is big enough to take into account most longrange correlations between word tokens, then Hn(T ) is a close approximation of H(T ). However, since the number of different blocks grows exponentially with n, very big corpora are needed to get reliable estimates. Note that Schürmann & Grassberger [27] use an English corpus of 70M words and assert that entropy estimation beyond a block size of 5 letters (not words) is already unreliable. We will therefore stick with block sizes of 1, i.e. unigram entropies here.\nHowever, we implement a more parsimonious approach taking into account dependencies between words. This is based on the theory behind Lempel-Ziv compression [34, 35]."

      "text" : "Instead of calculating Hn(T ) with ever increasing block sizes n, Kontoyiannis et al. [12] and Gao et al. [8] suggest to use the findings on optimal compression by Ziv & Lempel [34, 35].\nMore precisely, [8] show that entropy estimation based on the so-called increasing window estimator, or LZ78 estimator [5], is efficient in terms of convergence.\nApplied to the problem of estimating word entropies, the method works as follows: for any given word token ti in a text find the longest matchlength l for which the string s = (ti, ti+1, ..., ti+l) matches a preceding string in (t1, ..., ti−1). Formally, define l as\nli = 1 + max{0 ≤ l ≤ i : si+l−1i = s j+l−1 j for some 0 ≤ j ≤ i− 1}. (7)\nThis is an adaptation of Gao et al.’s [8] match-length definition.2 To illustrate this, take the example of the English Bible again:\nin1 the2 beginning3 god4 created5 the6 heavens7 and8 the9 earth10 and11 the12 earth13 was14 waste15 and16 empty17 [...]\nFor the word token beginning, in position 3, there is no match in the preceding string (in the). Hence, the match-length l3 is 0(+1) = 1. If we look at and in position 11, then the longest matching string is and the earth. Hence, the match-length l11 is 3(+1) = 4.\nNote that the average match-lengths across all word tokens reflect the redundancy in the string - which is the inverse of unpredictability. Based on this connection, Gao et al. [8] (Equation 6) show that the entropy of the string can be approximated as\nH̃(T ) = 1\nN N∑ i=2 log2(i) li , (8)\nwhere N is the overall number of tokens, and i is the position in the string. This approximates the entropy rate, or per-symbol entropy [8], which is denoted as h by Lesne et al. [13], and for which holds\nh = lim N→∞\nH(tN+1|t1, t2, ..., tN). (9)\nIn other words, as the number of tokens N approaches infinity, h reflects the average information content of a token tN+1 conditioned on all preceding tokens. So h accounts for all statistical dependencies between tokens [13].\nWe will call h and its approximation H̃(T ) the source entropy - after Shannon’s [29] formulation of the entropy of an information source.3\n2Note that Gao et al. [8] give a more general definition that also holds for the so-called sliding window, or LZ77 estimator.\n3Note that in the limit, i.e. as block sizes n approach infinity, block and source entropies are the same. Also, for an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variable, the block entropy of block size 1, i.e. H1(T ), is identical to the source entropy h [13]. However, as pointed out above, in natural languages words are not independently distributed.\n9\n10"

If we choose SD < 0.05 as a convergence criterion, then we get the convergence points per language given in Table 2.\nNote that all 21 languages converge to stable entropies below text sizes of 100K tokens, with a maximum of 70K tokens (bg and ro) and an average of 35K for source and 38K for block entropies.

Again, source entropies are systematically lower than block entropies.\nIt is remarkable that given the wide range of potential entropies - from 0 to >16 - most natural languages fall on a relatively narrow spectrum.

      "text" : "Independent of the estimation method - using block or source entropies - texts of 100K tokens are generally sufficient to estimate values reliably. This was shown across 21 languages of the EPC. Of course, this is not to say that there are no texts/languages in a bigger corpus like the PBC for which convergence might take longer. Note that the 21 EPC languages cover around 50% of the full range of values across the PBC sample. For example, block entropies range from ≈ 9 for English to ≈ 12 for Finnish in the EPC, and from ≈ 6 to ≈ 13 in the PBC.\n6Five clear outliers were removed here. These are texts of languages like Chinese (cmn) and Khmer (khm), which rather delimit phrases and sentences by white spaces. These have incommensurable source and block entropies.\nMoreover, there is a strong correlation between block and source entropies. This is somewhat surprising considering that the probabilities of word occurrences are generally assumed to be strongly dependent on co-text. Of course, there is a co-text effect. It yields source entropies which are lower than block entropies. However, the difference between them is systematic and allows us to predict source entropies from unigram block entropies. Namely, a linear model fitted through the points in Figure 4 can be specified as\nH̃(T ) = −1.59 + 0.82H1(T ). (10) Via Equation 10 we can convert block entropies into source entropies with a mean difference of 0.03. Note that estimating source entropies requires searching strings of length i − 1. As i increases, the CPU time per additional word token increases linearly, whereas unigram block entropies can be estimated based on dictionaries of word types and their token frequencies, and the processing time per additional word token is constant. Hence, Equation 10 can help to reduce processing cost."

As is shown in Figure 5, Koehn’s BLEU scores for pairwise translations correlate with the pairwise ratios of entropies (r = 0.58, p < 0.0001).\nFor example, Finnish (fi) is a high entropy language (H̃(T ) = 8.35) compared to English (en) (H̃(T ) = 6.32). Translating from Finnish to English gives a BLEU score of 21.8, and from English to Finnish 13. As pointed out above, this is due to the fact that translating into a higher entropy language means having more “choice” - or uncertainty - when translating words (or phrases). So the low performance from English to Finnish is predicted by a low English-to-Finnish entropy ratio (6.32/8.35 = 0.76), compared to the Finnish-to-English ratio (8.35/6.32 = 1.32)."

For example, words in Finnish are biased to have higher information content on average than words in English. This bias is a problem for the cross-linguistic application of similarity measures.

Based on these findings, we estimated entropies across 1360 texts and 1001 languages. Furthermore, we have shown empirically that there is a strong correlation between block and source entropies across these languages.\nOverall, our results help to understand better the performance of multilingual translation systems, and to make measures in distributional semantics cross-linguistically applicable."

Our results help to establish quantitative language comparisons, to understand the performance of multilingual translation systems, and to normalize semantic similarity measures.",
