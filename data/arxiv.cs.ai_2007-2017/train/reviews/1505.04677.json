We introduce notions of saturation and witnessed non-redundancy of sets of graded attribute implications are show that bases of graded attribute implications given by systems of pseudo-intents correspond to non-redundant sets of graded attribute implications with saturated consequents where the non-redundancy is witnessed by antecedents of the contained graded attribute implications. We introduce an algorithm which transforms any complete set of graded attribute implications parameterized by globalization into a base given by pseudo-intents. Experimental evaluation is provided to compare the method of obtaining bases for general parameterizations by hedges with earlier graph-based approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 May 2015 15:15:53 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04677v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vilem vychodil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04677"}
