      "text" : "1 Disjunctive Normal Networks Mehdi Sajjadi, Mojtaba Seyedhosseini and Tolga Tasdizen, Senior Member, IEEE,\nAbstract—Artificial neural networks are powerful pattern classifiers; however, they have been surpassed in accuracy by methods such as support vector machines and random forests that are also easier to use and faster to train. Backpropagation, which is used to train artificial neural networks, suffers from the herd effect problem which leads to long training times and limit classification accuracy. We use the disjunctive normal form and approximate the boolean conjunction operations with products to construct a novel network architecture. The proposed model can be trained by minimizing an error function and it allows an effective and intuitive initialization which solves the herdeffect problem associated with backpropagation. This leads to state-of-the art classification accuracy and fast training times. In addition, our model can be jointly optimized with convolutional features in an unified structure leading to state-of-the-art results on computer vision problems with fast convergence rates. A GPU implementation of LDNN with optional convolutional features is also available\nI. INTRODUCTION\nAN artificial neural network (ANN) consisting of onehidden layer of squashing functions is an universal approximator for continuous functions defined on the unit hypercube [1], [2]. However, until the introduction of the backpropagation algorithm [3], training such multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks was not possible in practice. The backpropagation algorithm propelled MLPs to be the method of choice for many classification and regression applications. However, eventually MLPs were replaced by more recent techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) [4] and random forests (RF) [5]. In addition to being surpassed in accuracy by these modern techniques, an important drawback of MLPs has been the high computational cost of training emphasized by growing data set sizes and dimensionality. An underlying reason for the limited accuracy and high computational cost of training is the herd-effect problem [6]. During backpropagation each hidden unit tries to evolve into a useful feature detector from a random initialization; however, this task is complicated by the fact that all units are changing at the same time without any direct communication between them. Consequently, hidden units can not effectively subdivide the necessary computational tasks among themselves leading to a complex dance which can take a long time to settle down.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new network architecture that overcomes the difficulties associated with MLPs and backpropagation for supervised learning. Our network consists of one adaptive layer of feature detectors implemented by logistic sigmoid functions followed by two fixed layers of logical units that compute conjunctions and disjunctions, respectively. We call the proposed network architecture Logistic Disjunctive\nThe authors are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112 USA e-mail: mehdi@sci.utah.edu\nNormal Network (LDNN). Unlike MLPs, LDNNs allow for a simple and intuitive initialization of the network weights which avoids the herd-effect. Furthermore, due to the single adaptive layer, it allows larger step sizes in minimizing the error function. We also propose a deep learning structure which consists of automatic convolutional feature extractors and LDNNs as efficient classifiers. The proposed structure performs automatic feature extraction and classification simultaneously and in an unified structure. Finally, we present results of experiments on LDNN for general classification and image classification using proposed deep structure. For general classification, we conducted experiments on 10 binary and 6 multi-class classification problems. LDNNs outperformed MLPs in every case both in terms of accuracy and computational speed. LDNNs produced the best accuracy in 11 out of the 16 classification problems in comparison to SVMs and RFs. For image classification, we tested our deep structure on 5 popular datasets. Our model was able to achieve state-ofthe-art performance on 2 out of 5 datasets and competitive results on the rest."

      "text" : "Extensive research has been performed on variants of the backpropagation algorithm including batch vs. stochastic learning [7], [8], squared error vs. cross-entropy [9] and optimal learning rates [10], [11]. Many other practical choices including normalization of inputs, initialization of weights, stopping criteria, activation functions, target output values that will not saturate the activation functions, shuffling training examples, momentum terms in optimization, and optimization techniques that make use of the second-order derivatives of the error are summarized in [12]. More recently, Hinton et al. proposed a Dropout scheme for backpropagation which helps prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors [13]. Despite the extensive effort devoted to making learning MLPs as efficient as possible, the fundamental problems outlined in Section I remain because they arise from the architecture of MLPs. Contrastive divergence [14], [15] can be used to pre-train networks in an unsupervised manner prior to backpropagation such that the herd-effect problem is alleviated. Contrastive divergence has been used successfully to train deep networks. The LDNN model proposed in this paper can be seen as an architectural alternative for supervised learning of ANNs.\nThe idea of representing classification functions in disjunctive form has been previously explored in the literature. Fuzzy min-max networks [16], [17], [18] represent the classification function as the union of axis aligned hypercubes in the feature space. The most important drawback of this model is its limitation to axis aligned decision boundaries which can significantly increase the number of conjunctions necessary\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n85 34\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 0\nD ec\n2 01\n4\n2 for a good approximation. We construct a significantly more efficient approximation by using an union of convex polytopes. Furthermore, fuzzy min-max neural networks employ an adhoc expansion-contraction scheme for learning, whereas we formulate learning as an energy minimization problem. Lu et al. [19] proposed a multi-sieving network that decomposes learning tasks. Lee et al. [20] proposed a disjunctive fuzzy network which is based on prototypes; however, it lacks an objective function and is based on an adhoc training procedure. Similarly, the modular network proposed by Lu and Ito [21] removes the axis aligned hypercube restriction from fuzzy min-max networks; however, their network can not be learned by minimizing a single energy function. Our LDNN model uses differentiable activation functions which makes it possible to optimize the network parameters in an unified manner by minimizing a single energy function. We show that unified training of our classifier results in very significant accuracy advantages over the modular network. Differentiable approximations of min-max functions have been used to construct fuzzy neural network that can be trained using steepest descent [22], [23], [24], [25], but these have produced results that are significantly less accurate than stateof-the-art classification techniques. A closely related approach to ours is adaptive mixtures of local experts which uses a gating network to stochastically select the output from a set of feedforward networks [26]. The reader is referred to [27] for a survey of mixture of expert methods. The products of experts approach models complex probability distributions by multiplying simpler distributions is also related [28].\nBesides the network approaches discussed in the previous paragraph, the idea of partitioning the decision space and learning simpler decision functions in each partition has been explored. Mixture discriminant analysis treats each class as a mixture of Gaussians and learns discriminants between the Gaussians [29]. Subclass discriminant analysis also relies on modeling classes as mixtures of Gaussians prior to learning discriminant [30]. Local linear discriminant analysis clusters the data and learns a linear discriminant in each cluster [31]. In these approaches partitioning of the space is treated as a step independent from the supervised learning step. Wang and Saligrama, proposed a more recent approach that unifies space partitioning and supervised learning [32]. While this method is related in concept to our disjunctive learning, in Section IV-C we show that LDNNs outperform space partitioning by a large margin. Dai et al. proposed an approach which places local classifiers close to the global decision boundary [33]. Toussaint and Vijayakumar propose a products-of-sigmoids model for discontinuously switching between local models [34]. Another approach greedily builds a piecewise linear classifier by adding classifiers in regions of error clusters [35]. Local versions of SVMs have also been explored [36], [37]. A specific type of local classification is based on the idea of pairwise coupling between positive and negative examples or clusters is conceptually close to the initialization we propose for our LDNN model. These methods typically employ a clustering algorithm, learning classifiers between pairs of positive and negative clusters found by clustering, finally followed by a combination scheme such as voting to integrate the pairwise\nclassifiers into a single decision [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. The modular network [21] discussed previously also falls into this category.\nDespite the limitations mentioned earlier, artificial neural networks are the basis for highly successful Convolutional Neural Networks [45], [46] (ConvNet). ConvNets are special types of neural networks based on two properties: local connectivity and weight sharing. In general, a ConvNet consists of a few convolutional layers followed by one or more fully connected layers. The training process is done using error back-propagation all the way to the first layer. ConvNets have shown impressive results on many vision tasks including but not limited to classification, detection, localization and scene labeling [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]. They work best when large labeled data is available for training. For example, the state-ofthe-art results for large 1000-category ImageNet [52] dataset was significantly improved using ConvNets [53]. The main reason for this success is that ConvNets are strong feature learners for images. However, the classifier part in a ConvNet consists of one or a few layers of fully connected neural networks. These fully connected layers exhibit the limitations of MLPs including the herd-effect problem discussed earlier. There is a whole body of literature on the general task of classification in the past two decades that ConvNets simply cannot directly exploit in an unified structure because the classifier of choice is usually incompatible with learning by back-propagation and training the feature extractor and classifier independently does not lead to a structure with optimum performance. Usually, joint optimization of deep structures leads to a better solution or at least improves the result of layer-wise learning [14].\nIn this paper, we proposed a deep model which replaces fully connected layers with LDNN. We compared this model with state-of-the-art methods. These models are based on ConvNet. A notable and successful example is MCDNN proposed by Ciresan et al. [49]. In this model, they train multiple networks with slightly distorted and different inputs. The final classification is obtained by a voting scheme over probabilities of different networks.\nThe state-of-the-art results on many image classification datasets are achieved by DropConnect proposed by Wan et al. [50]. The idea of DropConnect is inspired by Dropout [13]. They randomly drop the connections between the nodes instead of dropping output nodes of intermediate layers. We compared our model to ConvNets that use DropConnect in their fully connected layers. We show that our method is able to achieve competitive results with fewer epochs and smaller training parameters in most of the cases. Another recent example proposed by Goodfellow et al. is Maxout Networks [51]. Instead of using an activation function over the output of a single node, they take the maximum output of a group of hidden nodes as the output. Here, the Max operator acts as an activation function. They also use a similar approach for convolutional layers. We provide comparisons with Maxout networks. But in general, they require significantly large networks because the output of a node or a convolutional map is determined by maximum of several input nodes or maps.\n3"

      "text" : "Consider the binary classification problem f : Rn → B where B = {0, 1}. Let Ω+ = {x ∈ Rn : f(x) = 1}. Lets approximate Ω+ as the union of N convex polytopes Ω̃+ = ∪Ni=1Pi where the i’th polytope is the intersection Pi = ∩Mij=1Hij of Mi half-spaces Hij = {x ∈ Rn : hij(x) > 0}. We can replace Mi with M = maxiMi without loss of generality. Hij is defined in terms of its indicator function\nhij(x) =\n{ 1, ∑n k=1 wijkxk + bij ≥ 0\n0, otherwise , (1)\nwhere wijk and bij are the weights and the bias term. Any Boolean function b : Bn → B can be written as a disjunction of conjunctions, also known as the disjunctive normal form [54]. Hence, we can construct the function\nf̃(x) = N∨ i=1  M∧ j=1 hij(x)  ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nbi(x)\n(2)\nsuch that Ω̃+ = {x ∈ Rn : f̃(x) = 1}. Since Ω̃+ is an approximation to Ω+, it follows that f̃ is an approximation to f . Our next step is to provide a differentiable approximation to this disjunctive normal form. First, the conjunction of binary variables\n∧M j=1 hij(x) can be replaced by the product∏M\nj=1 hij(x). Then, using De Morgan’s laws [54] we can replace the disjunction of the binary variables ∨N i=1 bi(x)\nwith ¬ ∧N\ni=1 ¬bi(x), which in turn can be replaced by the expression 1− ∏N i=1(1− bi(x)). Finally, we can approximate the perceptrons hij(x) with the logistic sigmoid functions\nσij(x) = 1 1 + e− ∑n k=1 wijkxk+bij . (3)\nThis yields the differentiable approximation to f̃\nf̂(x) = 1− N∏ i=1 (1− M∏ j=1\nσij(x)︸ ︷︷ ︸ gi(x) ), (4)\nwhich can also be visualized as a network (Figure 1). We refer to the proposed network architecture as LDNN. The only adaptive parameters of the LDNN are the weights and biases of the first layer of logistic sigmoid functions. The second layer consists of N soft NAND gates which implement the logical negations of the conjunctions gi(x) using products. The output layer is a single soft NAND gate which implements the disjunction using De Morgan’s law. We will refer to a LDNN classifier which has N NAND gates in the second layer and M discriminants per NAND gate as a N ×M LDNN. Note that other variations of disjunctive normal networks can be constructed by using any classifier that is differentiable with respect to its parameters in place of the logistic sigmoid functions."

      "text" : "Consider a set of training examples Γ = {(x, y(x))} where y(x) denotes the desired binary class corresponding to x. Let Γ+ and Γ− be the subsets of Γ for which y = 1 and y = 0, respectively. The disjunctive normal form permits a very simple and intuitive initialization of the network weights. To initialize a N ×M LDNN, we first partition Γ+ and Γ− into N and M clusters, respectively. Let vij = c+i − c − j where c + i and c−j are the centroids of the i’th positive and j’th negative clusters, respectively. We initialize the weight vectors as wij = vij/|vij|. Finally, we initialize the bias terms bij such that the logistic sigmoid functions σij(x) take the value 0.5 at the midpoints of the lines connecting the positive and negative cluster centroids. In other words, let bij = 〈wij , 0.5(c+i +c − j )〉 where 〈a,b〉 denotes the inner product of the vectors a and b. This procedure initilizes gi(x), the i’th conjunction in the second hidden layer of the LDNN, to a convex polytope which aims to separate the training instances in the i’th cluster of Γ+ from all training instances in Γ−. We give an intuitive description of LDNN initialization in the context of the two moons dataset. An illustration of this dataset and three clusters for each of the two classes are shown in (Figure 2a). Initial discriminants for the positive clusters taken one at a time are shown in (Figure 2b-d). The conjunction of these discriminants form convex polytopes for the positive clusters (Figure 2e-g). The disjunction of these conjunctions before and after weight optimization (Section III-C) are illustrated in (Figure 2h). This initialization procedure is similar to the modular neural network proposed by Lu and Ito (12) as well as to locally linear classifica-\n4 tion by pairwise coupling (20) in general. Each module in Lu and Ito’s modular network independently learns a linear classifier between a pair of positive and negative training data clusters. The key difference of our classifier from Lu and Ito’s network, as well as from locally linear classification by pairwise coupling in general, is that we learn all the linear discriminants simultaneously by minimizing a single error function. When each module is trained independently, the success of the initial clustering can strongly influence\nthe outcome. In Section IV, we show, using both real and artificial datasets, that this important disadvantage can create very significant differences in classification accuracy between modular networks and LDNNs."

The error is back-propagated through soft gates to update the learnable weights. It is also possible to calculate\n5 the sensitivities for the input vector:\n∂E ∂xk = 2(f(x)− y) N∑ i=1 ∏ r 6=i (1− gr(x))gi(x)×\nM∑ j=1 (1− σij(x))wijk, k = 1, . . . , n (10)\nThis allows us to train a convolutional feature extractor by back-propagating the error. In other words, we can seamlessly replace the fully-connected layers in ConvNet with LDNN. This combination is compatible because both ConvNet feature extractor and LDNN classifier are being trained using backpropagation via the chain rule. Our proposed structure is shown in Figure 3.\nFor the case of multiclass classification, we use multiple LDNNs (one for every class). In this setup, the backpropagated errors for all the LDNNs will be summed together to form the sensitivities for convolutional layers. Assuming that C is the number of classes:\n∂E ∂xk = C∑ c=1 2(fc(x)− yc) N∑ i=1 ∏ r 6=i (1− gcr(x))gci(x)\nM∑ j=1 (1− σcij(x))wcijk, k = 1, . . . , n (11)\nfc(x) is output of the LDNN corresponding to class c. yc (for c = 1, . . . , C) is the label vector for datapoint x. In the above equations, it is assumed that we are minimizing quadratic error. We can also minimize the cross-entropy loss function: E(W,Γ) = − ∑ (x,y)∈Γ y log f(x)+(1−y) log(1− f(x)). It must be noted that using multiple LDNNs does not make the algorithm noticeably slower compared to a similarly configured ConvNet.\nAssuming that we have L convolutional layers, the forward pass for this structure starts from (8). Beginning from input data, we use this equation recursively until we get the output maps of the last convolutional layer, which is XLj . The input for LDNN is formed by reshaping and concatenating the maps of the last convolutional layer into a vector:\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFig. 4.

Then we can perform the forward pass of LDNN using (4) and perform the backward pass using (6) and (7) to update LDNN weights and biases. Then we can use (11) to get sensitivities with respect to LDNN inputs: [∂E/∂x1, ∂E/∂x2, . . . , ∂E∂xn]. By reshaping this vector into 2D maps, we can get the sensitivities for maps in the last convolutional layer (i.e., ∂E/∂XLj ). Having these sensitivities, we can back-propagate the error to convolutional layers using (9)."

      "text" : "We first experimented with the two moons artificial dataset to evaluate the LDNN algorithm with and without the proposed clustering initialization. We also compare the LDNN model with the modular neural networks(ModN)) [21]. To construct the two moons dataset, we start by generating random radius and angle pairs (r, θ). For both moons, r is an uniform random variable between R −W/2 and R + W/2 where R and W are parameters that determine the radius and the width of the moons, respectively. For the top moon, θ is an uniformly distributed random variable between 0 and π. For the bottom moon, θ is an uniformly distributed random variable between π and 2π. The Cartesian coordinates for data points on the top and bottom moons are then generated as (R cos θ,R sin θ) and (R cos θ−W/2, R sin θ−α), respectively. The parameter α determines the vertical separation between the two moons. We generated a training and a testing dataset by using the parameters R = 1, W = 0.7, α = −0.7 which generates slightly overlapping classes. Both datasets contained 1000 instances on the top moon and 1000 instances on the bottom moon. Then, for each n ∈ [1, 7], we trained 50 n × n LDNNs starting from random parameter initializations, 50 n × n LDNNs initialized from k-means clustering with n clusters per moon and 50 n × n ModNs initialized from kmeans clustering with n clusters per moon.

Testing accuracies were computed over the second dataset which was not used in training. Table I shows the mean, minimum and maximum testing error over the 50 trials for each of the models. We observe that training the LDNN model starting from a random initialization is successful in general; however, the range of testing error rates varies by a larger amount compared to when a cluster initialization is used resulting in a slightly worse mean testing error. We also note that the LDNN model performs better both on average and when comparing the maximum error rates over the 50 trials than the ModN model. Figure 4 illustrates the output of the LDNN model for n = 3, which appears to be an appropriate choice based on Table I. The outputs of the 3 conjunctions are also shown separately to give further intuition into the behavior of the LDNN model. Notice the similarity to Figures 2(e-h)).\nThe two-spirals dataset is an extremely difficult dataset for the MLP architecture trained with the backpropagation algorithm [6]. The original dataset consists of 194 (x, y) pairs arranged in two interlocking spirals that orbit the origin three times. The classification task is to determine which spiral any given (x, y) point belongs to. We used the farthest distance clustering algorithm [55] for initialization of both models. The k-means clustering algorithm places most centroids near the origin where the data points are denser and fewer centroids on the spiral arms further from the origin where the data is sparser. On the other hand, the farthest distance clustering algorithm provides more uniformly distributed centroids which leads to better classification results with fewer clusters. We performed clustering with maximum distance thresholds 2.2, 2.0 and 1.5 resulting in 18, 21 and 27 clusters per class, respectively. For each of these, we trained a LDNN and a ModN. Note that the number of parameters in both models is the same for the same number of clusters. We used stochastic gradient descent with a step size of 0.3, a momentum term weight of 0.1 and 2, 000 epochs for training all models. LDNN achieved 0 percent training error in each of these cases while the ModN’s training error was 0.232, 0.062 and 0 percent, respectively. These results suggest that the unified learning framework of LDNN is able to capture the spiral dataset with many fewer parameters than independent, pairwise learning of discriminants as in [21]. Furthermore, it can be seen from Figure 5 that LDNN creates a much smoother approximation to the spirals than pairwise learning. Finally, we note that LDNN initialized randomly was not able to find a satisfactory\nlocal minimum of the error function via gradient descent. This is similar to the failure of the standard MLP architecture for this dataset. This observation underlines the importance of the existence of an intuitive initialization for the LDNN architecture."

For SVM training, each dimension of the feature vector was linearly scaled to the range [0, 1].

We also fine tuned the step size for gradient descent. The number of epochs for training was selected using the cross-validation set except for the IJCNN dataset. For the IJCNN dataset cross-validation set was also used in training as in [58] and the number of epochs was fixed at 20.\nFor MLP training, there are two main parameters. The first one is the number of hidden nodes which was varied from 2 to 40 to find the best test set accuracy. This was followed by fine tuning the step size for backpropagation. The number of epochs was chosen using the cross-validation set. We also trained a second MLP classifier (MLP-m) for which the number of hidden nodes was chosen as N ×M to match the total number of logistic sigmoid functions in the LDNN classifier. This was done to compare LDNN to a MLP with approximately the same degrees of freedom. It was not feasible to train the MLP-m classifier for 4 of the datasets due to extremely long training times. Similarly, a modular network, which we refer to as Mod-N, with the same number of conjunctions and disjunctions as the LDNN classifier was trained to control for the degrees of freedom.\nThere are three main parameters involved in RF training. The first one is the number of trees. We choose a sufficiently large number of trees to ensure that the out of bag error rate converges. The second parameter is the number of features that will be considered in every node of the tree. We tried a range of numbers around the square root of the number of features [5]. The last parameter is the fraction of total samples that will be used in the construction of each tree. We tried 2/3, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 and 1/5 as possible values for this parameter.\nFor SVM training, a RBF kernel was used for all datasets except for the MNIST dataset for which a 9th degree polynomial kernel was used [14]. For all datasets except MNIST, we used the grid search tool provided by the Libsvm guide [57] to set the parameters of the RBF kernel.\nThe training and model parameters selected for all models are listed in Table II.\n3) Results: All of the classifiers we consider, with the exception of SVM, are stochastic. Therefore, each experiment with the exception of SVM was repeated 50 times to obtain mean, minimum and maximum testing errors which are reported in Table II for all classifiers. The LDNN classifier outperformed MLPs for all datasets. Furthermore, LDNNs also outperform MLP-m in all datasets for which the MLPm classifier was trained. In 8 out of 10 datasets, the mean LDNN error was smaller than the minimum MLP error, and, in 5 out of 6 datasets, the mean LDNN error was smaller than the minimum MLP-m error. All algorithms were run on an Intel i7-3770 3.4 Ghz CPU. In all datasets LDNNs were significantly faster to train than the MLPs. These results signify that the LDNN network architecture and training offers a faster to train and more accurate alternative to MLPs and backpropagation. The LDNN classifier also outperformed the Mod-N classifier in all datasets including several datasets such as Forest cover type and Wisconsin breast cancer where the accuracy difference was very large. This emphasizes the importance of training the entire network in an unified manner.\nConsidering all of the classifiers tested, LDNNs had the lowest testing error in 7 out of 10 datasets. LDNNs outperformed SVMs in 8 out of 10 cases and RFs in 7 out of 10 cases. In 5 out of 10 cases the mean LDNN error was lower than the minimum RF error. The RF mean error was lower than the LDNN minimum error in only 2 out of 10 cases. Finally, LDNNs never severely over fit the data, whereas RFs has significant accuracy differences between training and testing sets for several datasets including Adult, PIMA Indian diabetes, German credit and Forest cover type."

In that paper, a SVM is trained on a feature set generated by a deep belief network. The model and classifier training parameters were chosen as described in Section IV-B2 and are reported in Table III. LDNN and RF experiments were repeated 20 times to obtain mean, minimum and maximum testing errors which are reported in Table III. The LDNN classifier is also related to the idea of space partitioning [32] which combines partitioning of the space and learning a local classifier for each partition into a global objective function for supervised learning. All space partitioning classifier results are reported from [32]. LDNNs had the best accuracy in 4 out of 6 datasets. Note that the minimum and maximum testing errors for LDNNs were equal for MNIST."

We incorporated our LDNN into a GPU implementation of ConvNet that is publicly available at [59]. Most of the experiments described here are done using this GPU implementation. In all the experiments, we found good parameters using cross-validation on a small portion of training data and repeat the training on all training data. For all the datasets, we repeated the experiments a number of times and report two numbers here. One is the average over error rates of different experiments and the other is the voting result of different experiments. For obtaining the voting result, we average the predicted probabilities of different experiments before calculating the error rate. Basically the only difference between multiple runs of the experiments for every dataset is the random initialization of weights."

      "heading" : "A. MNIST",
      "text" : "MNIST [46] is probably the most popular dataset in the area of digit classification. It contains 60000 training and 10000 test samples of size 28×28 pixels. We conducted two sets of experiments on this dataset: the first on unmodified MNIST data and the second on the MNIST with the augmented\n8 training set. For the first task, we used 2 convolutional layers as feature detectors. The first layer uses 7×7 filters and produces 20 maps. The second layer also uses 7×7 filters but produces 15 maps. Ten LDNNs perform the classification part (one per class). Every LDNN consists of 5 groups and 5 discriminants per group. No preprocessing was performed on this dataset. We trained 4 networks with this setting and used voting for the final classification. We did not use annealing, momentum or any type of regularization for this case. However, the convergence is very fast and on average it requires less than 20 epochs, significantly faster than any other neural networkbased method, which require hundreds of epochs to train\n[50], [60]. Furthermore, the number of trainable parameters in our case is less than in most other ConvNet-based methods. Using this setting, we obtained 0.38% test error rate on the unmodified MNIST dataset. Table IV compares this error rate to other algorithms. The solutions based on maxout Networks [51] (0.45%) and stochastic pooling [60] (0.47%) also use convolutional feature learning but require more trainable parameters or training epochs. For example, stochastic pooling uses 3 convolutional layers with 64 maps in each layer and 280 training epochs. Results of Maxout Networks are obtained by using 3 convolutional layers and 96 maps in each of them. In a matched experiment, we compared the convergence properties\nof our method to conventional ConvNet. The number of nodes in fully-connected layer of ConvNet is set to be the same as the number of linear discriminants in LDNN. For ConvNet, another layer of weights was added to connect the fullyconnected layer to ten outputs. Everything else is exactly the same for both structures. The convergence plot is shown in Figure 6. We can see that our structure performs better in terms of accuracy and convergence. It must be noted that a conventional ConvNet is significantly faster to converge compared to structures with Dropout or DropConnect.\nWe obtained the results of the first experiment using a simple MATLAB implementation, mainly because the GPU implementation does not allow for any arbitrary choice for the number of maps per layer. However, for the second task of MNIST discussed below and the rest of experiments we used the GPU implementation. In addition, for the first task of MNIST we used quadratic error. For the rest of the experiments, however, the cross-entropy error was minimized.\nFor the second task, we used data translation, rotation and scaling. Image translation was achieved by cropping the\n10\noriginal images to 24×24 patches picked at random locations. Random rotations of maximum 15 degrees and random scaling of maximum 15% of the original size were also used during training. For this task, we opted for a network with two larger convolutional layers. For the first layer, 5×5 filters were used to produce 64 maps, and 4×4 filters were used in the second one to produce 128 maps. LDNNs with 4 groups and 4 discriminants per group perform the classification part. We did not use any preprocessing for this task. We trained 5 networks for 100, 15 and 15 epochs with corresponding learning rates of 1e-3, 1e-4 and 1e-5. An error rate of 0.19% was achieved by voting the results of these 5 networks. Table V compares this result to other methods. The result of DropConnect [50] (0.21%) is obtained after 1000 epochs of training, which is nearly 10 times more than our training epochs. Our best results over different runs of the algorithm was 0.22% for a single model network. For comparison, the 0.23% error rate reported in [49] obtained by voting of 35 single networks."

Our setup for this dataset consists of 2 convolutional layers followed by two locally connected layers. There are 64 maps in each convolutional layer and 32 maps in each locally connected layer. Filters are 5×5 in convolutional layers and 3×3 in locally connected layers (the same as ’layers-conv-local-13pct.cfg’ of [59]). LDNNs with 7 groups and 7 discriminants per group were used for classification. Training data was also augmented with image translations, which is done by taking 24×24 cropped versions of the original images at random locations. A common preprocessing for this dataset is to subtract the per pixel mean of the training set from every image [13]. We trained 5 networks for 500, 20 and 20 epochs with corresponding learning rates of 1e-3, 1e-4 and 1e-5 for convolutional layers and 1e-2, 1e-3 and 1e-4 for LDNN layer. We obtained 9.39% error rate by voting these 5 single networks. The state-of-the-art result for this task is 9.32% reported by Wan et al. [50] and obtained by voting of 12 networks. They also used the same GPU implementation of [59] to obtain this number. Their model, however, is based on ’layers-conv-local-11pct.cfg’ setting, which is a slightly more complex model. This setting contains two extra response normalization layers and the first locally connected layer contains 64 maps (vs. 32 in our setting). Another notable difference is that they trained their network for over 1000 epochs. In comparison, our network converged in 540 epochs, which is nearly half of their number of epochs. It must\nbe noted that our method achieves better average error rate compared to other models that use multiple networks. The result of Maxout networks [51] obtained by a much bigger network which has 3 convolutional layers with 192, 384 and 384 maps respectively.

Generally, SVHN is a more difficult task than MNIST because of the large variations in the images.\n11\nIt is common to apply local contrast normalization to each 3 RGB channel of the input image in order to reduce the effect of variations of the images [65]. We did not perform any kind of preprocessing for this dataset. We simply converted the color images to grayscale by removing hue and saturation information. The feature extractor is similar to CIFAR10. We used locally connected layers with 64 maps for this case. LDNNs with 4 groups and 4 discriminants per group perform the classification. We did a careful annealing in this case and trained the model for 200, 20, 20 and 10 epochs with learning rates of 1e-3, 1e-4, 1e-5 and 5e-6. Image translation, rotation and scaling were also applied during training. Images were cropped to 28×28 at random locations for image translation. For the last 10 epochs, we turned off image rotation and scaling. Four networks were trained using this setting and we obtained a 1.92% error rate after voting. Table VIII compares this number to other results. The 1.94% reported by Wan et al. [50] is obtained after 150 epochs. This faster convergence is probably because of their preprocessing scheme.

      "heading" : "VI. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We believe that the LDNN network architecture and training can become a favorable alternative to MLPs for supervised learning with artificial neural networks. The LDNN classifier has several advantages over MLPs: First, LDNNs allow for a simple and intuitive initialization of the network weights before supervised learning that avoids the herd-effect. Second, due to the single adaptive layer, learning can use larger step-sizes in gradient descent. We demonstrated empirically that LDNNs are significantly faster to train and are more accurate than MLPs. Similar to MLPs, the LDNN classifier also requires the choice of model complexity. The number of conjunctions (number of positive training clusters) and the number of logistic sigmoid functions per conjunction (number of negative training clusters) need to be chosen. However, the complexity of the model could be chosen automatically by either using a validation set, as commonly done for\nSVM training, or by initializing the LDNN in different ways. For instance, sequential covering algorithms can be used to generate a set of rules [66]. Each rule is a conjunction and the final classification is a disjunction of these conjunctions which can easily be converted to a LDNN classifier and fine tuned using gradient descent.\nWhile LDNNs are similar in architecture to modular neural networks [21], they are significantly more accurate owing to the unified training of the network that we introduced. LDNNs outperformed RFs in 13 of the 16 datasets and outperformed SVMs in 12 of the 16 datasets. Based on these results and observations, we believe that LDNNs should be considered as a state-of-the art classifier that provides a viable alternative to RFs and SVMs. Further improvements in accuracy can be possible by using cross-entropy instead of the square error criterion or by using adaptive step sizes for training LDNNs. Another possibility is to use more powerful nonlinear discriminants such as conic sections in (3).\nFinally, our deep structure is a novel combination of a powerful automatic feature learner and LDNN as an efficient classifier. The whole structure is jointly optimized using backpropagation via the chain rule. We demonstrated its reliability through different experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, NORB, SVHN and CIFAR100 datasets. We showed that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art results on these datasets using the proposed structure. Furthermore, in most of the cases, the average error rate of our structure is better than state-of-the-art methods."

Backpropagation, which is used to train artificial neural networks, suffers from the herd effect problem which leads to long training times and limit classification accuracy. We use the disjunctive normal form and approximate the boolean conjunction operations with products to construct a novel network architecture. The proposed model can be trained by minimizing an error function and it allows an effective and intuitive initialization which solves the herdeffect problem associated with backpropagation. This leads to state-of-the art classification accuracy and fast training times. In addition, our model can be jointly optimized with convolutional features in an unified structure leading to state-of-the-art results on computer vision problems with fast convergence rates. A GPU implementation of LDNN with optional convolutional features is also available",
