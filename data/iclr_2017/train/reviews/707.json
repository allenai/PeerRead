{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Reference-Aware Language Models", "abstract": "We propose a general class of language models that treat reference as an explicit stochastic latent variable. This architecture allows models to create mentions of entities and their attributes by accessing external databases (required by, e.g., dialogue generation and recipe generation) and internal state (required by, e.g. language models which are aware of coreference). This facilitates the incorporation of information that can be accessed in predictable locations in databases or dis- course context, even when the targets of the reference may be rare words. Experiments on three tasks show our model variants outperform models based on deterministic attention.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper introduces pointer-network neural networks, which are applied to referring expressions in three small-scale language modeling tasks: dialogue modeling, recipe modeling and news article modeling. When conditioned on the co-reference chain, the proposed models outperform standard sequence-to-sequence models with attention.\n\nThe proposed models are essentially variants of pointer networks with copy mechanisms (Gulcehre et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2016; Ling et al., 2016), which have been modified to take into account reference chains. As such, the main architectural novelty lies in 1) restricting the pointer mechanism to focus on co-referenced entities, 2) applying pointer mechanism to 2D arrays (tables), and 3) training with supervised alignments. Although useful in practice, these are minor contributions from an architectural perspective.\n\nThe empirical contributions are centred around measuring perplexity on the three language modeling tasks. Measuring perplexity is typical for standard language modeling tasks, but is really an unreliable proxy for dialogue modeling and recipe generation performance. In addition to this, both the dialogue and recipe tasks are tiny compared to standard language modeling tasks. This makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of the dialogue and recipe modeling results. For example, if one was to bootstrap from a larger corpus, it seems likely that a standard sequence-to-sequence model with attention would yield performance comparable to the proposed models (with enough data, the attention mechanism could learn to align referring entities by itself).

But it seems the paper was rushed into the deadline, as there are a few major weaknesses.\n\nThe first major weakness is that the claimed latent variables are hardly latent in the actual empirical evaluation. As clarified by the authors via pre-review QAs, all mentions were assumed to be given to all model variants, and so, it would seem like an over-claim to call these variables as latent when they are in fact treated as observed variables. Is it because the models with latent variables were too difficult to train right?\n\nA related problem is the use of perplexity as an evaluation measure when comparing reference-aware language models to vanilla language models. Essentially the authors are comparing two language models defined over different event space, which is not a fair comparison. Because mentions were assumed to be given for the reference-aware language models, and because of the fact that mention generators are designed similar to a pointer network, the probability scores over mentions will naturally be higher, compared to the regular language model that needs to consider a much bigger vocabulary set. The effect is analogous to comparing language models with aggressive UNK (and a small vocabulary set) to a language models with no UNK (and a much larger vocabulary set).\n\nTo mitigate this problem, the authors need to perform one of the following additional evaluations: either assuming no mention boundaries and marginalizing over all possibilities (treating latent variables as truly latent), or showing other types of evaluation beyond perplexity, for example, BLEU, METEOR, human evaluation etc on the corresponding generation task.\n\nThe other major weakness is writing in terms of technical accuracy and completeness. I found many details opaque and confusing even after QAs. I wonder if the main challenge that hinders the quality of writing has something to do with having three very specialized models in one paper, each having a lot of details to be worked out, which may have not been extremely important for the main story of the paper, but nonetheless not negligible in order to understand what is going on with the paper.
