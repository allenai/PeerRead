{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection", "abstract": "In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems. In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "In this paper a novel approach for anomaly detection is considered for the task of intrusion detection based on system call sequence.\nThe system call sequence is regarded as a language, and multiple lstm-rnn language models are trained and ensembled. \nDiversity in the ensemble is achieved by choosing different hyper parameters for each lstm-LM.\nThe combination of the LMs is done by averaging transformations of the likelihoods. \n\nI really like the fact that no attack data is used during training, and I like the LM and ensemble approach. \nThe only high level drawbacks I have are the following, which might have a simple answer as I'm not an expert in this field:\n\n- Relaying of system calls seems weak: If the attacker has access to some \"normal\" sequences of system calls, all she can fool the system by interleaving its malicious system calls with normal ones, in a way that will artificially raise the likelihood of the sequence. \n- A few lines covering other anomaly detection tasks, where RNNs are used, can be added to the introduction, to give a better idea about the novelty of the approach.", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "This is a pure application paper: an application of LSTMs to host intrusion detection systems based upon observed system calls. And from the application standpoint, I don't believe this is a bad paper, the authors seem to achieve reasonable results from the method (though admittedly, I can't really judge the quality of these results without a lot more familiarity based upon current work in intrusion detection systems). However, in terms of the ICLR audience, I simply don't believe there is enough here to warrant substantial interest. As an example, the authors highlighted the distinction between network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and felt that one review was completely unsuitable because they didn't realize this distinction when reading the paper. This is of course a crucial distinction from the security application side, but from the algorithmic/ML side, it's simply not that important, and the fact that there _has_ been previous work exactly on LSTMs for NIDS makes this paper unlikely to have a huge impact in the ICLR community. It would be much better suited to a security conference, where the application could be judged on its own merits, and the community would likely understand much better how significant these results were.\n \n Pros:\n + Nice application of LSTMs to HIDS task\n \n Cons:\n - Nothing really novel from the algorithmic/ML side\n - The significance of the results are difficult to assess without more formal understanding of the problem domains\n \n The PCs have thus decided that this paper isn't ready to appear at the conference.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "revision", "OTHER_KEYS": "Sungroh Yoon", "comments": "In order to reflect the comments from reviewers, the revised manuscript now includes additional references to related work (Introduction) and more in-depth comparison with existing methods (Section 3.2) as well as more details of our future work (Conclusion).", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "19 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper presents an anomaly-based host intrusion detection method.

The idea of using neural networks (in general) for NIDS is old [1]. The idea of using some sort of NN on top of a sequence of system calls for NIDS is published [2]. The idea of using LSTMs for NIDS is published [2]. The paper in [2] operates on counts of N-grams of system calls, rather than on the raw sequence, but that pre-processing does not seem \"heavy\" to me.\n\nOverall, the proposed system works as well as other proposed NIDS system, and the paper checks portability (which is good).\n\nBut, on the con side, I don't see this paper as adding a lot to the state-of-the-art in NIDS. Nor does is the paper well-matched to ICLR. I didn't learn a lot about representations from this paper: many people have thrown LSTM at sequence problems.\n\nTherefore, I think it's below threshold for ICLR.
