{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Cortical-Inspired Open-Bigram Representation for Handwritten Word Recognition", "abstract": "Recent research in the cognitive process of reading hypothesized that we do not read words by sequentially recognizing letters, but rather by identifing open-bigrams, i.e. couple of letters that are not necessarily next to each other.  In this paper, we evaluate an handwritten word recognition method based on original open-bigrams representation. We trained Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNNs) to predict open-bigrams rather than characters, and we show that such models are able to learn the long-range, complicated and intertwined dependencies in the input signal, necessary to the prediction.  For decoding, we decomposed each word of a large vocabulary into the set of constituent bigrams, and apply a simple cosine similarity measure between this  representation and the bagged RNN prediction to retrieve the vocabulary word.  We compare this method to standard word recognition techniques based on  sequential character recognition. Experiments are carried out on two public databases of handwritten words (Rimes and IAM), an the results with our bigram decoder are comparable  to more conventional decoding methods based on sequences of letters.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper explores the use of Open Bigrams as a target representation of words, for application to handwriting image recognition. \n\nPros:\n- The use of OBs is novel and interesting.\n- Clearly written and explained.\n\nCons:\n- No comparison to previous state of the art, only with author-generated results. \n- More ablation studies needed -- i.e. fill in Table3 with rnn0,1 rnn0,1,2 rnn0,1' etc etc. It is not clear where the performance is coming from, as it seems that it is single character modelling (0) and word endings (') that are actually beneficial.\n- While the use of Open bigrams is novel, there are works which use bag of bigrams and ngrams as models which are not really compared to or explored.

These open bigrams are subsequently used to predict the written word in a decoding step. The experiments indicate that the system does slightly better than a baseline model that uses Viterbi decoding. I have some major concerns about this paper:\n\n- I find the \"cortical inspired\" claim troublesome. If anything, it is psychology/cognitive science inspired, in the sense that open bigrams appear to help for word recognition (Touzet et al. 2014). But the implied cortical characteristics, implicitly referred to e.g. by pointing to analogies between deep neural nets for object recognition and in that case the visual cortex, is unfounded. Is there any direct evidence from neuroscience that open-bigrams constitute a wholly separate layer in the cortex for a handwriting recognition task? Dehaene's work is a proposal, so you'll need to describe more \"findings in cognitive neurosciences [sic] research on reading\" (p. 8) to substantiate those claims. I am further worried by the fact that the authors seem to think that \"deep neural networks are based on a series of about five pairs of neurons [sic] layers\". Unless I misunderstand something, you are specifically referring to Krizhevsky's AlexNet here (which you should probably have cited there)? I hope you don't mean to imply that all deep neural nets need five layers. It is also not true that ten is \"quite close to the number of layers of an efficient deep NN\" -- what network? what task? etc.\n\n- The model is not clearly explained. There is a short paragraph in Appendix A.3. that roughly describes the setup, but this does not include e.g. the objective function, or answer why the network output is only considered each two consecutive time steps, rather than at each time step (or so it seems?). This is probably because the paper argues that it \"is focused on the decoder\" (p. 6), rather than on the whole problem. I find this problematic, because in that case we're effectively measuring how easy it is to reconstruct a word from its open bigrams, which has very little to do with handwriting recognition (it could have been evaluated on any text corpus). In fact, as the example on page 4 shows, handwriting is not necessary to illustrate the open bigram hypothesis. Which leads me to wonder why these particular tasks were chosen, if we are only interested in the decoding mechanism?\n\n- The comparison is not really fair. The Viterbi decoder only has access to unigrams, as far as I can tell. The only model that does better than that baseline has access to a lot more information, and does not do that much better. Did the Viterbi model have access to the word boundary information (at one point rather confusingly called \"extremities\") that pushed the open bigram model over the edge in terms of performance? Why is there no comparison to e.g. rnn_0,1' (unigram+bigram+boundary markers)? The dataset also appears to be biased in favor of the proposed approach (longer words, only ). I am not convinced that this paper really shows that open bigrams help.\n\nI very much like the idea of the paper, but I am simply not convinced by its claims.\n\nMinor points:\n- There are quite a few typos. Just a sample: \"independant\" (Fig.1), \"we evaluate an handwritten\", \", hand written words [..], an the results\", \"their approach include\", \"the letter bigrams of a word w is\", \"for the two considered database\"\n- Wouldn't it be easy to add how many times a bigram occurs, which would improve the decoding process? You can just normalize over the full counts instead of the binary occurrence counts.\n- The results in Table 5 are the same (but different precision) as the results in Table 2, except that edit distance and SER are added, this is confusing.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"TITLE": "Review", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "comments": "This submission investigates the usability of cortical-inspired distant bigram representations for handwritten word recognition. Instead of generating neural network based posterior features for character (optionally in local context), sets posterior for character bigrams of different length are used to represent words.  The aim here is to investigate the viability of this approach and to compare to the standard approach.\n\nOverall, the submission is well written, although information is missing w.r.t. to the comparison between the proposed approach and the standard approach, see below.\n\nIt would be desirable to see the model complexity of all the different models used here, i.e. the number of parameters used.\n\nLanguage models are not used here. Since the different models utilize different levels of context, language models can be expected to have a different effect on the different approaches. Therefore I suggest to include the use of language models into the evaluation.\n\nFor your comparative experiments you use only 70% of the data by choosing longer words only. On the other hand, it is well known that the shorter words are more prone to result in misrecognitions. The question remains, if this choice is advantageous for one of the tasks, or not - corresponding quantitative results should be provided to be able to better evaluate the effect of using this constrained corpus. Without clarification of this I would not readily agree that the error rates are competitive or better than the standard approach, as stated at the end of Sec. 5.\n\nI do see the motivation for introducing open-bigrams in an unordered way due to the corresponding evidence from cognitive research. However, decision theoretically I wonder, why the order should be given up, if the underlying sequential classification problem clearly is of a monotonous nature.
