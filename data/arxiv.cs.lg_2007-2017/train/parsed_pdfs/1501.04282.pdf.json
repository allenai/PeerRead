The class label predictors learned by minimizing transitional loss functions are sensitive to the noisy and outlying labels of training samples, because the transitional loss functions are equally applied to all the samples. To solve this problem, we propose to learn the class label predictors by maximizing the correntropy between the predicted labels and the true labels of the training samples, under the regularized Maximum Correntropy Criteria (MCC) framework. Moreover, we regularize the predictor parameter to control the complexity of the predictor. The learning problem is formulated by an objective function considering the parameter regularization and MCC simultaneously.

      "text" : "The classification machine design has been a basic problem in the pattern recognition field. It tries to learn an effective predictor to map the feature vector of a sample to its class label [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. We study the supervised multi-class learning problem with L classes. Suppose we have a training set denoted as D = {(xi, yi)}, i = 1, · · · , N , where xi = [xi1, · · · , xiD ] ⊤ ∈ RD is the D dimensional feature vector of the i-th training sample, and yi ∈ {1, · · · , L} is the class label of i-th training sample. Moreover, we also denote the label indicator matrix as Y = [Yli] ∈ R L×N , and Yli = 1 if yi = l, and −1 otherwise. We try to learn L class label predictors {f lθ(x)}, l = 1, · · · , L for the multi-class learning problem, where f lθ(x) is the predictor for the l-th class and θ is its parameter. Given a sample xi, the output of the l-th predictor is denoted as f l θ(xi), and we further denote the prediction result matrix as Fθ = [Fθli] ∈ R L×N , and Fθli = f l θ(xi). To make the prediction as precise as possible, the target of predictor learning is to learn parameter θ, so that the difference between true class labels of the training samples in Y and the prediction results in Fθ could be minimized, while keeping the complexity of the predictor as low as possible. To measure how well the prediction results fit the true class label indicator, several loss functions L(Fθ, Y ) could be considered to compare the prediction results in Fθ against the true class labels of the training samples in Y , such as the 0-1 loss function, the square loss function, the hinge loss function, and the logistic loss function. We summarize various loss functions in Table 1.\nThese loss functions introduced in Table 1 have been used widely in various learning problems. One common feature of these loss function is that a samplewise loss function is applied to each training sample equally and then the losses of all the samples are summed up to obtain the final overall loss. The samplewise loss functions are of exactly the same form with the same parameter (if they have parameters). The basic assumption behind this loss function is that the training samples are of the same importance. However, due to the limitation of the sampling technology and noises occurred during the sampling procedure,\nthere are some noisy and outlying samples in real-world applications. If we use the transitional loss functions listed in Table 1, the noisy and outlying training samples will play more important roles even than the good samples. Thus the predictors learned by minimizing the transitional loss functions are not robust to the noisy and outlying training samples, and could bring a high error rate when applied to the prediction of test samples.\nRecently, regularized correntropy framework has been proposed for robust pattern recognition problems [11, 12, 13, 14]. In [15], He et, al argued that the classical mean square error (MSE) criterion is sensitive to outliers, and intro-\nduced the correntropy to improve the robustness of the presentation. Moreover, the l1 regularization scheme is imposed on the correntropy to learn robust and sparse representations. Inspired by their work, we propose to use the regularized correntropy as a criterion to compare the prediction results and the true class labels. We use correntropy to compare the predicted labels and the true labels, instead of comparing the feature of test sample and its reconstruction from the training samples in He et, al’s work. Moreover, an l2 norm regularization is introduced to control the complexity of the predictor. In this way, the predictor learned by maximizing the correntropy between prediction results and the true labels will be robust to the noisy and outlying training samples. The proposed classification Machine Maximizing the Regularized CorrEntropy, which is called RegMaxCEM, is supposed to be more insensitive to outlining samples than the ones with transitional loss functions. Yang et, al. [16] also proposed to use correntropy to compare predicted class labels and true labels. However, in their framework, the target is to learn the class labels of the unlabeled samples in a transductive semi-supervised manner, while we try to learn the parameters for the class label predictor in a supervised manner.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we propose the regularized maximum correntropy machine by constructing an objective function based on the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) and developing an expectation – maximization (EM) based alternative algorithm for its optimization. In Section 3, the proposed methods are validated by conducting extensive experiments on two challenging pattern classification tasks. Finally, we give the conclusion in Section 4."

      "text" : "To design the predictors f lθ(x), we first represent the data sample x as x̃ in\nthe linear space and the kernel space as:\nx̃ =\n   x, (linear),\nK(·, x), (kernel), (1)\nwhere K(·, x) = [K(x1, x), · · · ,K(xN , x)] ⊤ ∈ RN and K(xi, xj) is a kernel function between xi and xj . Then a linear predictor f l θ(x) will be designed to predict whether the sample belongs to the l-th class as\nf lθ(x) = w ⊤ l x̃+ bl, l = 1, · · · , L, (2)\nwhere θ = {(wl, bl)} L l=1 is the parameters of the predictors, wl ∈ R D is the linear coefficient vector and bl ∈ R is a bias term for the l-th predictor. The target of predictor designing is to find the optimal parameters to have the prediction result f lθ(xi) of the i-th sample to fit its true class label indicator Yli as well as possible, while keeping the solution as simple as possible. To this end, we consider the following two problems simultaneously when designing the objective function:\nPrediction Accuracy Criterion based on Correntropy To consider the pre-\ndiction accuracy, we could learn the predictor parameters by minimizing a loss function listed in Table 1 as\nmin θ L(Fθ, Y ) (3)\nHowever, as we mentioned in Section 1, all these loss functions are applied to all the training samples equally, which is not robust to the noisy samples and outlying samples. To handle this problem, instead of minimizing a loss function to learn the predictor, we use the MCC [11] framework to learn the predictor by maximizing the correntropy between the predicted results and the true labels.\nRemark 1: In previous studies, it has been claimed that the MCC is insensitive to outliers. For example, in [11], it is claimed that “the maximum correntropy criterion, ... is much more insensitive to outliers.” Based on this fact, we assume that the predictors developed based on MCC should also be insensitive to outliers.\nCorrentropy is a generalized similarity measure between two arbitrary random variablesA and B. However, the joint probability density function of A and B is usually unknown, and only a finite number of samples of them are available as {(ai, bi)} d i=1. It leads to the following sample estimator of correntropy:\nV (A,B) = 1\nd\nd∑\ni=1\ngσ(ai − bi), (4)\nwhere gσ(ai − bi) = exp ( − (ai−bi) 2\n2σ2\n) is a Gaussian kernel function, and σ\nis a kernel width parameter. For a learning system, MCC is defined as\nmaxϑ 1\nd\nd∑\ni=1\ngσ(ai − bi) (5)\nwhere ϑ is the parameter to be optimized in the criterion so that B is as correlated to A as possible.\nRemark 2: ϑ is usually a parameter to define B, but not the kernel function parameter σ. In the learning system, we try to learn ϑ so that with the learned ϑ, B is correlated to A. For example, in this case, A is the true class label matrix while B is the predicted class label matrix, and ϑ is the predictor parameter to define B.\nTo adapt the MCC framework to the predictor learning problem, we let A be the prediction result matrix Fθ parameterized by θ, and B be the true class label matrix Y , and we want to find the predictor parameter θ such that Fθ becomes as correlated to Y as possible under the MCC framework. Then, the following correntropy-based predictor learning model will be obtained:\nmax θ V (Fθ, Y ),\nV (Fθ, Y ) = 1\nL×N\nL∑\nl=1\nN∑\ni=1\ngσ(Fθli − Yli) (6)\nPlease notice that in [11], MCC is used to measure the similarity between a test sample and its sparse linear representation of training samples, while in this work it is used to measure the similarity between the predicted class label and its true label. Also note that the dependence on σ in (6) and later (8), (11) relies on the dependence of the kernel function gσ(·). In our experiments, the σ value is calculated as σ = 12×L×N ∑L l=1 ∑N i=1 ‖Fθli − Yli‖ 2 2 following [11].\nPredictor Regularization To control the complexity of the l-th predictor in-\ndependently, we introduce the l2-based regularizer ||wl|| 2 to the coefficient vector wl of the l-th predictor. We assume that the predictors of different classes are equally important, and the following regularizer is introduced for multi-class learning problem:\nmin {wl}Ll=1\n1 L\nL∑\nl=1\n||wl|| 2 (7)\nRemark 3:The l2 norm is also used by support vector regression as a measure of model complexity. However, in support vector classification, this regularization term is either obtained by a “maximal margin” regularization or obtained by a “maximal robustness” regularization for certain type of feature noises [17]. Thus our l2 norm regularization term can also be regarded as a term to seek maximal margin or robustness.\nRemark 4: The l2-regularization is used in comparison to the l1-regularization in our model. Using l1-regularization we can seek the sparsity of the predictor coefficient vector, but it cannot guarantee the minimal model complexity, maximal margin or maximal robustness like the l2-regularization, thus we choose to use the l2-regularization. In the future, we will ex-\nplore the usage of l1-regularization to see if the prediction results can be improved.\nBy substituting θ = {wl, bl} L l=1, Fθli = f l wl,bl (xi), and combining both the predictor regularization term in (7) and the prediction accuracy criterion term based on correntropy in (6), we obtain the following maximization problem for the maximum correntropy machine:\nmax {(wl,bl)}Ll=1\n1\nL×N\nL∑\nl=1\nN∑\ni=1\ngσ(f l wl,bl (xi)− Yli)− α 1\nL\nL∑\nl=1\n||wl|| 2 (8)\nwhere α is a tradeoff parameter. This optimization problem is based on correntropy using a Gaussian kernel function gσ(x). It treats the prediction of individual training samples of individual classes differently. By this way, we can give more emphasis on samples with correctly predicted class labels, while those noisy or outlying training samples will have small contributions to the correntropy. In fact, when the regularizer term is introduced, (8) is a case of the regularized correntropy framework [15]."

      "text" : "Due to the nonlinear attribute of the kernel function gσ(x) in the objective function in (8), direct optimization is difficult. An attribute of the kernel function gσ(x) is that its derivative is also the same kernel function, and if we set its derivative to zero to seek the optimization of the objective, it is not easy to obtain a close form solution. However, according to the property of the convex conjugate function, we have:\nProposition 1 There exists a convex conjugate function ϕ of gσ(x) such that\ngσ(x) = maxp(p||x|| 2 − ϕ(p)) (9)\nand for a fixed x, the maximum is reached at p = −gσ(x). This Proposition is taken from [18], which is further derived from the theory of convex conjugated functions. It is further discussed and used in many applications such as [11, 15, 19, 20].\nBy substituting (9) to (8), we have the augmented optimization problem in\nan enlarged parameter space\nmax {(wl,bl)}Ll=1,P\n1\nL×N\nL∑\nl=1\nN∑\ni=1\n[ Pli||f l wl,bl (xi)− Yli|| 2 − ϕ(Pli) ] − α 1\nL\nL∑\nl=1\n||wl|| 2\n= 1\nL×N\nL∑\nl=1\nN∑\ni=1\n[ Pli||w ⊤ l x̃i + bl − Yli|| 2 − ϕ(Pli) ] − α 1\nL\nL∑\nl=1\n||wl|| 2,\n(10)\nwhere P = [Pli] ∈ R N×L are the auxiliary variable matrix.

With fixed predictor parameters, the auxiliary variable −Pli can be regarded as confidence of prediction result of the i-th training sample regarding to the l-th class. The better the l-th prediction result of the i-th sample fits the true label Yli, the larger the −Pli will be.\nRemark 5: It is interesting to see if there is any relation between the auxiliary variables in P and the slack variables in SVM. Actually, both the auxiliary variables in P and the slack variables in SVM can be viewed as measures of classification losses. The slack variables in SVM are the upper boundaries of hinge losses of the training samples, while the auxiliary variables in P are a dissimilarity measure between the predicted labels and the true labels under the framework of the MCC rule, which is also a loss function. Meanwhile, the auxiliary variables in P also play a role of weights of different training samples as\nin (10), so that the learning can be robust to the noisy labels, but the auxiliary variables in SVM do not have such functions.\nRemark 6: In the expectation step, we actually solve an alternative optimization of solving P while fixing {(wl, bl)} L l=1.

ENSaptamers is a sensor array with seven sensors, and each sensor is designed using a DNA element.\nFor the experiment, we collected in total 66 samples of 6 different bacteria, including S.tyohimurium, S.flexneri, E.coli (CAU 0111), S.sonnei, S.typhi and E.coli (ATCC 25922).

The predictor parameters of RegMaxCEM were trained using the feature vectors and class labels of the training samples.

As shown in Figure 1, predictor produced by maximizing the correntropy yields improvements over other loss functions. Given the extremely small variation of classification accuracies over the ten splits, though the improvement of the accuracies are not large in absolute terms (around 0.1), it is consistent and significant. To verify whether the improvements are statistically significant, we performed the paired t-tests to the accuracies of the proposed method and other compared methods. The null hypothesis of the T-test is that the accuracies of the proposed method and the compared methods come from distributions with equal means. The P values of the t-tests are reported as measurements of statistically significance. A low P value implies that the difference between the proposed method and the compared methods are statistically significant. The P values are reported in Table 2. As we can see from the table, all the improvements archived by RegMaxCEM, for both linear representation and kernel representation, are statistically\nsignificant at the 0.05 significance level. This is not surprising: There are some noisy and outlying samples in the training set, which have been utilized by the methods with square loss, hinge loss or logistic loss as equally as other samples, thus they bring some bias to the predictor. However, the RegMaxCEM has the potential of filtering these samples, which can result in reliable learning of predictors in practice. It is also interesting to notice that the square loss, hinge loss and logistic loss have archived very similar classification accuracies. Though they used different loss functions, these loss functions are applied to the training samples equally."

We select 1,000 DNA-binding sites and 5,000 nonbinding sites from the PDNA-62 database to construct our database for the experiment. Given a candidate site, the goal of DNA-binding site prediction is to predict whether it is a DNA-binding site or not. To this end, the evolutionary information, solvent accessible surface area and the protein backbone structure features were extracted from the site, and then combined to construct the feature vector. The feature vector was further inputted into the classifier to distinguish DNA-binding sites from the non-binding sites [22].\nTo conduct the experiment, we employed the 10-fold cross validation. The database was split into 10 non-overlapping folds randomly, one of which was used as the test set, while the rest 9 of them were used as the training set. The procedure was repeated for 10 times so that each fold was used as the test set once.\nThe prediction performance was measured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and recall-precision curves. The usage of ROC curve is mainly due to the imbalanced classes. The ROC curve is created by plotting false positive rate (FPR) against true positive rate (TPR), while recall-precision curve is obtained by ploting recall against precision.

The class label predictors learned by minimizing transitional loss functions are sensitive to the noisy and outlying labels of training samples, because the transitional loss functions are equally applied to all the samples. To solve this problem, we propose to learn the class label predictors by maximizing the correntropy between the predicted labels and the true labels of the training samples, under the regularized Maximum Correntropy Criteria (MCC) framework. Moreover, we regularize the predictor parameter to control the complexity of the predictor. The learning problem is formulated by an objective function considering the parameter regularization and MCC simultaneously. By optimizing the objective function alternately, we develop a novel predictor learning algorithm. The experiments on two challenging pattern classification tasks show that it significantly outperforms the machines with transitional loss functions.",
