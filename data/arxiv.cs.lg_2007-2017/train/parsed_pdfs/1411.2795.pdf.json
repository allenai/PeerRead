      "text" : "Speaker identification have two categories: text-dependent and text-independent. Essentially, we are more interested and involved in the research of text independent speaker identification / verification with the reason that it doesn't impose as a necessity and demands regarding the utterances obtained from speaker that means there is no restriction over the words , it can be anything in any order, so the first basic steps involve the feature extraction from speech sample in the enrolment process of a speaker , extracted feature are collected in the database as a training data utterances. For the better accuracy, every time we are updating our training dataset while preparing training dataset for new utterances with previous stored data in our database, in this way model of each speaker is trained. Now in identification process with the help of probabilistic model a measurement of identification has to be done, the feature vectors of testing utterances is measured with feature vectors of training dataset and decision has to be made whether it belongs to a group of dataset or not."

      "heading" : "2. FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM VOCAL TRACT",
      "text" : "Human's vocal tract, the airway used in the production of speech is the organs above the vocal folds, especially the passage above the larynx, including the pharynx, mouth, and nasal cavities. which is formed of the oral part (pharynx, tongue, lips, and jaw) , olfactory nerves, and the nasal tract. When the glottal pulses signal generated by the vibration of the vocal folds passes through the vocal tract, it is modified. Human’s vocal tract is performing like a filter, and its frequency characteristics is dependent upon the resonance peak from the vocal tract and vocal tract configuration can be obtained from the spectral shape such as formant position and spectral inclination of the speech signal. These features can be obtained from the spectrogram of the speech signal and we are using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) features in speaker identification as it combines the advantages of the cepstrum analysis with a perceptual frequency scale based on critical bands. Although the speech signal is non-stationary, but can be assumed as stationary for a short duration of time, so analysis is done by framing the speech signal; the frame width is about 20−30 milliseconds, and the frames are shifted by about 10 milliseconds.\nThe number of feature vector that we get from utterances is usually large so for computation and the number of feature vectors can diminished without lose by K-means clustering method. This results in a small set of vectors called as codebook vector and a codebook is obtained for each speaker utterances using K-means. A codebook consist of many different vectors, which depict the important characteristics of each speaker. Each codebook is obtained as follows: Given a set of training set of MFCC feature vectors of 16-point vector for each frame of the utterance, which represent the speaker, find a decomposition of the feature vector space. Each decoposed region contains a cluster of vectors, which depict the same kind of basic sound. This region is represented by the centroid vector, which is the vector, which causes the minimum distortion when vectors in the region are mapped to it. Thus, each speaker has a codebook with a number of centroids which is prepared with the help of K-mean Clustering."

      "text" : "Vector quantization (VQ) is one of the simplest text-independent speaker models. VQ is often used for computational speed-up techniques and lightweight practical implementations. Vector\nquantization (VQ) is a ancient well-known quantization skills from signal processing which allows the modeling of probability density functions by the classification of prototype vectors. VQ is generally used by classifying a large se of (MFCC)feature vector dataset in small groups vectors having same number of points closet to the denser value i.e. means of codebook of training dataset\nFor Identification average quantization distortion is computed for the test utterance feature vectors by X = {x1,x2....xT}and the reference vectors by Ɍ={r1,r2….rk} .\nWhere d(.,.) is a distance measure such as the Euclidean distance ||xt-rk||. A smaller value DQ indicates higher likelihood for X and R originating from the same speaker.\nAbove Diagram1 shows speaker identification using Vector quantization modeling, the upper region is enrolment process while in lower region feature has been extracted from test utterance. Diagram2 shows the Vector quantization distortion measurements plot when the speaker identification’s test has been performed for 8 speakers. For K = 16 variations of distortion measurement from speaker i to speaker i utterances lies between (3.4561 to 7.0723) and from speaker i to speaker j lies between (13.1892 to 29.9038), where i, j ϵ (1 to 8).\nDiagram 4\nTable1.

      "heading" : "4. MODELING USING GAUSSIAN MIXTURE MODEL",
      "text" : "A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a parametric probability density function represented as a weighted sum of Gaussian component densities. It is generally used as a parametric model of the probability distribution of continuous spectrum. GMM parameters are computed by 'Expectation maximization' an iterative algorithm which takes some arbitrary value in initial estimation and carry on the iterative process until the convergence of value is observed and the whole Gaussian mixture model is defined by these parameters namely mean vectors (µi), covariance matrices(σi) and mixture weights(pi) from all different components, and the weighted sum of M Component density is given by\nwhere χ is a D-dimensional continuous-valued feature vector (in our case 16 dimensional), pi , i = 1, . . . ,M, are the mixture weights, and g(χ/µi,σi) are component densities. Each component density is a D-dimensional Gaussian function of the form,\nGMM based speaker identification model is shown below, the upper region is extraction of features from training dataset and preparing a mixture model using expectation maximization while in lower region feature has been extracted from test utterance, and finally with GMM parameter and extracted features from test utterances identification measurement has been done by using probability generation function\nOne of the powerful attributes of the GMM is its ability to form smooth approximations to arbitrarily shaped densities. There are several techniques available for estimating the parameters of a GMM i.e (µ, σ, p) and most popular and well-established method is maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. Since the equation of joint probability is nonlinear function of parameter λ so we can’t solve it easily because number of unknown variables are more than number of equations , so the parameter of ML is estimated iteratively by expectation maximization . The basic idea of the EM algorithm is, beginning with an initial model λi to estimate a new model λj such that p(χ/ λj) ≥ p(χ/ λi), where j > i . The new model then becomes the initial model for the next iteration and the process is repeated until some convergence threshold is reached, so by using number of utterances = 10 can give you a good approximated parameters (µ, σ, p) of GMM.\nTable2.

      "text" : "In this paper, we have introduced a text-dependent speaker identification system, we have investigated that Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) have proven extremely successful for textindependent speaker identification for long dataset of different speakers. Identification performance of the Gaussian mixture speaker model is insensitive to the method of model initialization however we have estimated the parameter using expectation maximization and Identification rate is very sensitive to number of cluster and number of iteration of expectation maximization we have performed the experiments in Matlab R2014a (The Language of Technical Computing), this model is currently being evaluated on a 75 speaker's utterances and the results indicate that Gaussian mixture models provide a robust speaker representation for the difficult task of speaker identification using corrupted, unconstrained speech of cocktail party or YouTube dataset The models are computationally inexpensive and easily implemented on a real-time platform."
