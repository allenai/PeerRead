      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Methods capable of learning distributed representations of arbitrary-length texts (i.e., fixed-length continuous vectors that encode the semantics of texts), such as sentences and paragraphs, have recently attracted considerable attention (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wieting et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2016b; Kenter et al., 2016). These methods aim to learn generic representations that are useful across domains similar to word embedding methods such as Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014).\nAnother interesting approach is learning distributed representations of entities in a knowledge base (KB) such as Wikipedia and Freebase. These methods encode information of entities in the KB\ninto a continuous vector space. They are shown to be effective for various KB-related tasks such as entity search (Hu et al., 2015), entity linking (Hu et al., 2015; Yamada et al., 2016), and link prediction (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015).\nIn this paper, we describe a novel method to bridge these two different approaches. In particular, we propose Neural Text-Entity Encoder (NTEE), a neural network model to jointly learn distributed representations of texts (i.e., sentences and paragraphs) and KB entities. For every text in the KB, our model aims to predict its relevant entities, and places the text and the relevant entities close to each other in a continuous vector space. We use humanedited entity annotations obtained from Wikipedia (see Table 1) as supervised data of relevant entities to the texts containing these annotations.1\nNote that, KB entities have been conventionally used to model semantics of texts. A representative example is Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007), which represents the semantics of a text using a sparse vector space, where each dimension corresponds to the relevance score of the text to each entity. Essentially, ESA shows that text can be accurately represented using a small set of its relevant entities. Based on this fact, we hypothesize that we can use the annotations of relevant entities as the supervised data of\n1Entity annotations in Wikipedia can be viewed as supervised data of relevant entities because Wikipedia instructs its contributors to create annotations only where they are relevant in its manual: https://en.wikipedia.org/ wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n02 49\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nM ay\nlearning text representations. Furthermore, we also consider that placing texts and entities into the same vector space enables us to easily compute the similarity between texts and entities, which can be beneficial for various KB-related tasks.\nIn order to test this hypothesis, we conduct three experiments involving both the unsupervised and the supervised tasks. First, we use standard semantic textual similarity datasets to evaluate the quality of the learned text representations of our method in an unsupervised fashion. As a result, our method clearly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.\nFurthermore, to test the effectiveness of our method to perform KB-related tasks, we address the following two important problems in the supervised setting: entity linking (EL) and factoid question answering (QA). In both tasks, we adopt a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier with the learned representations as features. We tested our method using two standard datasets (i.e., CoNLL 2003 and TAC 2010) for the EL task and a popular factoid QA dataset based on the quiz bowl quiz game for the factoid QA task. As a result, our method outperformed recent state-of-the-art methods on both the EL and the factoid QA tasks.\nAdditionally, there have also been proposed methods that map words and entities into the same continuous vector space (Wang et al., 2014; Yamada et al., 2016; Fang et al., 2016). Our work differs from these works because we aim to map texts (i.e., sentences and paragraphs) and entities into the same vector space.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n• We propose a neural network model that jointly learns vector representations of texts and KB entities. We train the model using a large amount of entity annotations extracted directly from Wikipedia.\n• We demonstrate that our proposed representations are surprisingly effective for various NLP tasks. In particular, we apply the proposed model to three different NLP tasks, namely semantic textual similarity, entity linking, and factoid question answering, and achieve stateof-the-art results on all three tasks."

      "text" : "Given a text t (a sequence of words w1, ..., wN ), we train our model to predict entities e1, ..., en that appear in t. Formally, the probability that represents the likelihood of an entity e appearing in t is defined as the following softmax function:\nP (e|t) = exp(ve >vt)∑\ne′∈EKB exp(ve′ >vt)\n, (1)\nwhere EKB is a set of all entities in KB, and ve ∈ Rd and vt ∈ Rd are the vector representations of the entity e and the text t, respectively. We compute vt using the element-wise sum of word vectors in t with L2 normalization and a fully connected layer. Let us denote vs as a vector of the sum of word vectors (vs = ∑N i=1 vwi), vt is computed as follows:\nvt = W vs ‖vs‖ + b, (2)\nwhere W ∈ Rd×d is a weight matrix, and b ∈ Rd is a bias vector. Here, we initialize vw and ve using the pre-trained representations described in the next section.\nThe loss function of our model is defined as follows: L = − ∑\n(t,Et)∈Γ ∑ e∈Et logP (e|t), (3)\nwhere Γ denotes a set of pairs each of which consists of a text t and its entity annotations Et in KB.\nOne problem in training our model is that the denominator in Eq. (1) is computationally very expensive because it involves summation over all entities\nin KB. We address this problem by replacing EKB in Eq. (1) with E∗, which is the union of the positive entity e and the randomly chosen k negative entities that do not appear in t. This method can be viewed as negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013b) with a uniform negative distribution.\nIn addition, because the length of a text t is arbitrary in our model, we test the following two settings: t as a paragraph, and t as a sentence2."

Consequently, the total number of parameters in our model is |V | × d + d2 + d.\nWe initialize the representations of words and entities using pre-trained representations to reduce the training time. We use the skip-gram model of Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b) with negative sampling trained with Wikipedia articles. In order to create a corpus for the skip-gram model from Wikipedia, we simply replace the name of each entity annotation in Wikipedia articles with the unique identifier of the entity the annotation refers to. This simple method enables us to easily train the distributed representations of words and entities simultaneously. We used a Wikipedia dump generated in July 20163. For the hyper-parameters of the skip-gram model, we used standard parameters such as the context window size being 10, and the size of negative samples being 5. We used the Python Word2vec implementation in Gensim4. Additionally, the entity representations were normalized to unit length before they were used as the pre-trained representations."

We train our model by iterating over the texts and their entity annotations in the corpus.\nWe used words that appear five times or more and entities that appear three times or more in the corpus, and simply ignored the other words and entities. As a result, our vocabulary V consisted of 705,168 words and 957,207 entities. Further, the number of valid words and entity annotations were approximately 382 million and 28 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, we also introduce one heuristic method to generate entity annotations. For each text, we add a pseudo-annotation that points to the entity of which the KB page is the source of the text. Because every KB page describes its corresponding entity, it typically contains many mentions referring to the entity. However, because hyper-linking to the web page itself does not make sense, these kinds of mentions cannot be observed as annotations in Wikipedia. Therefore, we use the aforementioned heuristic method to address this problem."

In both datasets, the ratings take values between 1 and 5, where a rating of 1 indicates that the sentence pair is not related, and a rating of 5 means that they are highly related. All sentence pairs except the 500 SICK trial pairs were used for our experiments.\nWe train our model by experimenting with both paragraphs and sentences. Further, we introduce another training setting (denoted by fixed NTEE), where the parameters in the word representations and the entity representations are fixed throughout the training.\nWe compute the cosine distance between the vectors of the two sentences in each sentence pair (derived using Eq. (2)) and measure the Pearson’s r and Spearman’s p correlations between these distances and the gold-standard human ratings. Additionally, we use Pearson’s r as our primal score."

      "heading" : "3.1.2 Baselines",

Brief descriptions of these models are as follows:\n• Word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b) is a popular word embedding model. We compute a sentence representation by element-wise addition of the vectors of its words (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008). We add its skip-gram and CBOW models to our baselines. We train the model with the hyper-parameters and the Wikipedia corpus explained in Section 2.2. Thus, the skip-gram model is equivalent to the pre-trained representations used in our model. Furthermore, in order to conduct a fair comparison between the skip-gram model and our model, we also add skip-gram (plain), which is a skip-gram model trained using a different corpus. In particular, the corpus is augmented using the texts in DBpedia abstract corpus6, and its entity annotations are treated as regular text phrases (not replaced to their unique identifiers).\n• Skip-thought (Kiros et al., 2015) is a model that is trained to predict adjacent sentences given each sentence in a corpus. Sentences are encoded using a recurrent neural network (RNN) with gated recurrent units (GRU).\n• Siamese CBOW (Kenter et al., 2016) is a model that aims to predict sentences occurring next to each other in a corpus. A sentence representation is derived using a vector average of words in the sentence.\nWe obtain a score of a sentence pair by using the cosine distance between the sentence representations of the pair."

We obtained the scores of Skipthought from (Hill et al., 2016a) and those of Siamese CBOW from (Kenter et al., 2016).\n6We augment the corpus simply by appending the texts in DBpedia abstract corpus to the Wikipedia corpus.\nOur NTEE models were able to outperform the state-of-the-art models in all datasets in terms of Pearson’s r. Moreover, our fixed NTEE models outperformed the NTEE models in several datasets and the skip-gram models in all datasets. Further, our model trained with sentences consistently outperformed the model trained with paragraphs. Additionally, the skip-gram models performed mostly similar regardless of the difference of their corpus.\nNote that, because we fix the word representations and the entity representations during the training of the fixed NTEE models, the difference between the fixed NTEE models and the skip-gram model is merely the presence of the learned fully connected layer. Because our model places a text representation and the representations of its relevant entities close to each other, the function of the layer can be recognized as an affine transformation from the word-based text representation to the entity-based text representation. We consider that the reason why the fixed NTEE model performed well among datasets is that the entity-based text representations are more semantic (less syntactic) and contain less noise than the word-based text representations, thus are much more suitable for addressing this task."

EL has recently received considerable attention because of its effec-\ntiveness in various NLP tasks such as information extraction and semantic search. The task is challenging because of the ambiguity in the meaning of entity mentions (e.g., “Washington” can refer to the state, the capital of the US, the first US president George Washington, and so forth).\nThe key to improve the performance of EL is to accurately model the semantic context of entity mentions. Because our model learns the likelihood of an entity appearance in a given text, it can naturally be used for modeling the context of EL."

The CoNLL dataset, which was proposed in (Hoffart et al., 2011), includes training, development, and test sets consisting of 946, 216, and 231 documents, respectively. We use the training set to train our EL method, and the test set for measuring the performance of our method. We report the standard micro- (aggregates over all mentions) and macro- (aggregates over all documents) accuracies of the top-ranked candidate entities.\nThe TAC 2010 dataset is another dataset constructed for the Text Analysis Conference (TAC)7 (Ji et al., 2010). The dataset comprises training and test sets containing 1,043 and 1,013 documents, respectively.

Further, we randomly select 10% of the documents from the training set, and use these documents as a development set.\nAdditionally, we collected two measures that have frequently been used in past EL work: entity popularity and prior probability. The entity popularity of an entity e is defined as log(|Ae,∗| + 1), where Ae,∗ is the set of KB anchors that point to e. The prior probability of mention m referring to entity e is defined as |Ae,m|/|A∗,m|, where A∗,m represents all KB anchors with the same surface as m, and Ae,m is a subset of A∗,m that points to e. These two measures were collected directly from the same Wikipedia dump described in Section 2.2."

      "heading" : "3.2.2 Our Method",
      "text" : "Following past work, we address the EL task by solving two sub-tasks: candidate generation and mention disambiguation.\nCandidate Generation In candidate generation, candidates of referent entities are generated for each mention. We use the candidate generation method proposed in (Yamada et al., 2016) for the sake of compatibility with their state-of-the-art results. In particular, we use a public dataset proposed in (Pershina et al., 2015) for the CoNLL dataset. For the TAC 2010 dataset, we use a dictionary that is directly built from the Wikipedia dump explained in Section 2.2. We retrieved possible mention surfaces of an entity from (1) the title of the entity, (2) the title of another entity redirecting to the entity, and (3) the names of anchors that point to the entity. Furthermore, to improve the recall, we also tokenize the title of each entity and treat resulted tokens as possible mention surfaces of the corresponding entity. We sort the entity candidates according to their entity popularities, and retain the top 100 candidates for computational efficiency. The recall of the candidate generation was 99.9% and 94.6% on the test sets of the CoNLL and TAC 2010 datasets, respectively.\nMention Disambiguation We address the mention disambiguation task using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a single hidden layer. Figure 1 shows the architecture of our neural network model.\nThe model selects an entity from among the entity candidates for each mention m in a document t. For each entity candidate e, we input the vector of the entity ve8, the vector of the document vt (computed with Eq. (2)), the dot product of ve and vt9,10, and the small number of features for EL described below. On top of these features, we stack a hidden layer with nonlinearity using rectified linear units (ReLU) and dropout. We also add an output layer onto the hidden layer and select the most relevant entity using softmax over the entity candidates.\nSimilar to past work (Chisholm and Hachey, 2015; Yamada et al., 2016), we include a small number of features in our model. First, we use the following three standard EL features: the entity popularity of e, the prior probability of m referring to e, and the maximum prior probability of e of all mentions in t. In addition, we optionally add features representing string similarities between the title of e and the surface of m (Meij et al., 2012; Yamada et al., 2016). These similarities include whether the title of e exactly equals or contains the surface of m, and whether the title of e starts or ends with the surface of m.\nWe tuned the following two hyper-parameters using the micro-accuracy on the development set of each dataset: the number of units in the hidden layer and the dropout probability. The results are listed in Table 3.\nFurther, we trained the model by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The learning rate was controlled by RMSprop, and the mini-batch size was set to 100. We also used the micro-accuracy on the development set to locate the best epoch for testing.\nWe tested the NTEE model and the fixed NTEE model to initialize the parameters of representations vt and ve. Furthermore, we also tested two simple methods using the pre-trained representations (i.e., skip-gram). The first method is that the representations of words and entities are initialized using the pre-trained representations presented in Section 2.2,\n8We normalized ve to unit length because of its overall higher accuracy.\n9Note that, the dot product represents the unnormalized likelihood that e appears in t (see Eq.(1)).\n10We also tested using the cosine similarity rather than the dot product, but it slightly degraded the performance in the EL task and the factoid QA task described below.\nand the other parameters are initialized randomly (denoted by SG-proj). The second method is the same method as in SG-proj except the training corpus of the pre-trained representations is augmented using the DBpedia abstract corpus (denoted by SGproj-dbp).11\nRegarding the NTEE and the fixed NTEE models, sentences (rather than paragraphs) were used to train the proposed representations because of the superior performance of this approach on both the CoNLL and TAC 2010 datasets. Further, we did not update our representations of words (vw) and entities (ve) in the training of our EL method, because updating them did not generally improve the performance. Additionally, we used a vector filled with zeros as representations of entities that were not contained in our vocabulary."

We also tested the performance of the NTEE model without using the string similarity features (strsim) and found that these features also contributed to the performance.\nFurthermore, our method successfully outperformed all the recent strong state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. This is remarkable because most state-of-the-art EL methods, including all baseline methods except that of He, adopt global approaches,\nwhere all entity mentions in a document are simultaneously disambiguated based on coherence among disambiguation decisions. Our method depends only on the local (or textual) context available in the target document. Thus, the performance can likely be improved further by combining a global model with our local model as frequently observed in past work (Ratinov et al., 2011; Chisholm and Hachey, 2015; Yamada et al., 2016).\nWe also conducted a brief error analysis using the NTEE model and the test set of the CoNLL dataset by randomly inspecting 200 errors. As a result, 22% of the errors were mentions of which the referent entities were not contained in our vocabulary. In this case, our method could not incorporate any contextual information, thus likely resulting in disambiguation errors. The other major types of errors were the mentions of location names. The dataset contains many location names (e.g., Japan) referring to sports team entities (e.g., Japan national football team). It appeared that our method neglected to distinguish whether a location name refers to the loca-\ntion itself or a sports team. In particular, our method often wrongly resolved these mentions referring to sports team entities into the corresponding location entities and vice versa. They accounted for 20.5% and 14.5% out of the total number of errors, respectively. Moreover, we observed several difficult cases such as selecting Hindu instead of Hindu nationalism, Christian instead of Catholicism, New York City instead of New York, and so forth."

In particular, despite the simplicity of the neural network architecture of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods (i.e., QANTA and FTSBRNN), our method clearly outperformed these methods. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed representations as background knowledge for the QA task.\nWe also conducted a brief error analysis using the test set of the history dataset. Our observations indicated that our method mostly performed perfect in terms of predicting the types of target answers (e.g., locations, events, and people). However, our method erred in delicate cases such as predicting Henry II of England instead of Henry I of England, and Syracuse, Sicily instead of Sicily."

      "heading" : "3.4 Qualitative Analysis",
      "text" : "In order to investigate what happens inside our model, we conducted a qualitative analysis using our proposed representations trained with sentences. We first inspected the word representations of our model and our pre-trained representations (i.e., the skip-gram model) by computing the top five similar words of five words (i.e., her, dry, spanish, tennis, moon) using cosine similarity. The results are presented in Table 6. Interestingly, our model is somewhat more specific than the skip-gram model. For example, there is only one word she whose cosine similarity to the word her is more than 0.5 in our model, whereas all the corresponding similar words in the skip-gram model (i.e., she, his, herself, him, and mother) satisfy that condition. We observe a similar trend for the similar words of dry. Furthermore, all the words similar to tennis are strictly related to the sport itself in our model, whereas the corresponding similar words of the skip-gram model contain broader words such as ball sports (e.g., badminton and volleyball). A similar trend can be observed for the similar words of spanish and moon.\nSimilarly, we also compared our entity represen-\ntations with those of the pre-trained representations by computing the top five similar entities of six entities (i.e., Europe, Golf, Tea, Smartphone, Scarlett Johansson, and The Lord of the Rings) with respect to cosine similarity. Table 7 contains the results. For the entities Europe and Golf, we observe similar trends to our word representations. Particularly, in our model, the most similar entities of Europe and Golf are Eastern Europe and Golf course, respectively, whereas those of the skip-gram model are Asia and Tennis, respectively. However, the similar entities of most entities (e.g., Tea, Smartphone, Scarlett Johansson and The Lord of the Rings) appear to be similar between our model and the skipgram model."

      "heading" : "4 Related Work",
      "text" : "Various neural network models that learn distributed representations of arbitrary-length texts (e.g., para-\ngraphs and sentences) have recently been proposed. These models aimed to produce general-purpose text representations that can be used with ease in various downstream NLP tasks. Although most of these models learn text representations from an unstructured text corpus (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Kiros et al., 2015; Kenter et al., 2016), there have also been proposed models that learn text representations by leveraging structured linguistic resources. For instance, Wieting et al. (Wieting et al., 2016) trained their model using a large number of noisy phrase pairs retrieved from the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013), and Hill et al. (Hill et al., 2016b) use several public dictionaries to train the model by mapping definition texts in a dictionary to representations of the words explained by these texts. To our knowledge, our work is the first work to learn generic text representations with the supervision of entity annotations in KB. Several methods have also been proposed for extending the word embedding methods. For example, Levy and Goldberg (Levy and Goldberg, 2014) proposed a method to train word embedding with dependency-based contexts, and Luan et al. (Luan et al., 2016) used semantic role labeling for generating contexts to train word embedding. Moreover, a few recent studies on learning entity embedding based on word embedding methods have been reported (Hu et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016). These models are typically based on the skip-gram model and\ndirectly model the semantic relatedness between KB entities. Our work differs from these studies because we aim to learn representations of arbitrary-length texts in addition to entities.\nAnother related approach is the relational embedding (or knowledge embedding) (Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015), which encodes entities as continuous vectors and relations as some operations on the vector space, such as vector addition. These models typically learn representations from large KB graphs consisting of entities and relations. Similarly, the universal schema (Riedel et al., 2013; Toutanova et al., 2015; Verga et al., 2016) jointly learned continuous representations of KB relations, entities, and surface text patterns for the relation extraction task.\nFinally, Yamada et al. (Yamada et al., 2016) recently proposed a method to jointly learn the embeddings of words and entities from Wikipedia using the skip-gram model and applied it to EL. Our method differs from their method in that their method does not directly model arbitrary-length texts (i.e., paragraphs and sentences), which we proved to be highly effective for various tasks in this paper. Moreover, we also showed that the joint embedding of texts and entities can be applied not only to EL but also for wider applications such as semantic textual similarity and factoid QA."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, we presented a novel model capable of jointly learning distributed representations of texts and entities from a large number of entity annotations in Wikipedia. Our aim was to construct the proposed general-purpose model such that it enables practitioners to address various NLP tasks with ease. We achieved state-of-the-art results on three important NLP tasks (i.e., semantic textual similarity, entity linking, and factoid question answering), which clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of our model. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis showed that the characteristics of our learned representations apparently differ from those of the conventional word embedding model (i.e., the skip-gram model), which we plan to investigate in more detail in the future.\nFuture work includes analyzing our model more extensively and exploring the effectiveness of our\nmodel in terms of other NLP tasks. We also aim to test more expressive neural network models (e.g., LSTM) to derive our text representations. Furthermore, we believe that one of the promising directions would be to incorporate the rich structural data of the KB such as relationships between entities, links between entities, and the hierarchical category structure of entities."

We train the model using a large corpus of texts and their entity annotations extracted from Wikipedia. We evaluated the model on three important NLP tasks (i.e., sentence textual similarity, entity linking, and factoid question answering) involving both unsupervised and supervised settings. As a result, we achieved state-of-the-art results on all three of these tasks.",
