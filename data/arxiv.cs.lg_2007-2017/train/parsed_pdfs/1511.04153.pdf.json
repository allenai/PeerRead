      "text" : "Spectral clustering methods which are based on eigendecomposition demonstrate splendid performance on many realworld challenge data sets. During the past decades, a series of spectral clustering methods have been proposed: Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [1], Local Linear Embedding (LLE) [2], Isomap [3], Laplacian Eigenmaps [4] and variant of Spectral Clustering [5]. There are three shortages of spectral clustering methods mentioned above. First, these approaches only provide the embedding map of the training data. The out-of-sample extension is not straightforward. Second, The complexity of these approaches relies on the number of data points. Third, the performance of spectral clustering methods highly depend on the robustness of the affinity graph.\nMany important progresses [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] have been made to mitigate the above issues of the spectral\n∗Corresponding author This paper is supported by NSFC (No. 61272247, 61533012, 61472075), the 863 National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (SS2015AA020501) and the Major Basic Research Program of Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (15JC1400103).\nclustering. Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) proposed in [7] introduces a linear projection obtained from Laplacian Eigenmaps. Their work provides a linear approximation of the embedding mapping, which reduces the time complexity and achieves out-of-sample extension straightforwardly. The linear embedding gives a metric learning perspective of the spectral clustering. Nie, Wang, and Huang proposed the Projected Clustering with Adaptive Neighbors (PCAN) in [14] where they regard the pairwise similarity as an extra variable to be solved in the optimization problem and they set a penalty of the rank of graph Laplacian to restrict specific connected components in the affinity matrix. With this framework, PCAN alternately update affinity matrix and projection. Although some affinity learning algorithms have been proposed in recent years, the technique of choosing an appropriate affinity matrix is still remained to be addressed.\nOur goal is to extract more adaptive similarity information with minimal extra time consumption for the linear approximation of spectral clustering. Such information will take the objective of locality preserving rather than only the distance between images into consideration. Inspired by the recent progress on scalable spectral clustering [10] and data similarity learning [14], we propose a novel approach dubbed Adaptive Affinity Matrix (AdaAM). Our affinity matrix is relatively dense and can capture both global and local information. Specifically, AdaAM decomposes the affinity graph into a product of two low-rank identical matrices. As the ideal case described in [5], if we assume the pairwise affinity in the same class are exceedingly similar, the affinity matrix may turn into a low-rank matrix. We optimize the decomposed matrix with the similar scheme of spectral clustering. The affinity graph obtained by optimization is used as an intermediate affinity matrix, firstly. With the combination of the intermediate affinity matrix and the k-NN affinity graph derived by the heat kernel, we figure out a final adaptive affinity matrix from a naive spectral clustering. We conduct the affinity graph with the data projection and apply LPP to this specific graph to learn a metric for clustering.\nWe illustrate the effective and efficiency of the proposed approach for clustering on image data sets. We show the advantage of AdaAM for challenging data sets by comparing our approach with k nearest neighborhood heat kernel (kNN)\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n04 15\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n1 Se\np 20\n16\n[4] and some other state-of-the-art algorithms in Section 3.

      "heading" : "2.2. Intermediate Affinity Matrix",
      "text" : "We separate our algorithm into two parts, intermediate affinity matrix and final adaptive affinity matrix. In this section, we will introduce the first part. For the i-th data point xi, we connect any the data point xi to the data point xj with the similarity δij . With the hope that small Euclidean distance between two data points leads to a large similarity, we aim to choose δij to minimize the following objective function\nmin n∑ i,j ‖xi − xj‖22 δij (2)\nunder appropriate constraints, where δij is the ij-th element of the intermediate affinity matrix ∆.\nDifferent from PCAN [14], we reformulate the equation with graph Laplacian,\nmin tr(XTL∆X) (3)\nunder some constraints.\nWith a straightforward thought we can decompose the Laplacian into two identical matrices, since the graph Laplacian is a positive semidefinite matrix in general. We show this thought is not appropriate in our framework as follows.\nIf we assume that\nL∆ = UU T (4)\nwhere U ∈ Rn×s is a column orthogonal matrix with UTU = I . With the relaxing of the constraints, we finally need to solve the problem\nU = arg min UTU=I\ntr(XTUUTX)\n⇒ U = arg min UTU=I\ntr(UTXXTU) (5)\nIf we assume the product of matrix X to be K (i.e. K = XXT ), the Eq. (5) gives a simple form of the Laplacian Eigenmaps\nThis optimization problem can be solved by selecting eigenvectors of matrix K corresponding to several smallest eigenvalues. However, K is a low-rank matrix generally with d n and the eigenvectors of K minimizing the objective function in Eq. (5) is in the null space of X . Hence, the solution of above problem is not unique. Inspired by LSC [10] we assume the affinity matrix to be a positive semidefinite matrix and decompose it into the product of a matrix P ∈ Rn×t with orthogonal columns and PT instead of decomposing the Laplacian matrix, where t is the expected rank of ∆.\nTherefore we reformulate Eq. (3) as\nmin PTP=I\ntr(XTD∆X) + tr(X T (−PPT )X) (6)\nwhere we abandon the properties that connected weight is non-negative and the graph Laplacian is positive semidefinite. The negative connected weights in ∆ can be used to measure the dissimilarity between data points. We will show that the solution of this optimization problem makes D∆ equal to 0.\nFor the first part of Eq. (6), we can write it as\nmin n∑ i=1 ‖xi‖22 d∆ii s.t. PTP = I\nd∆ii = (PP T 1)i\n(7)\nLet z = (‖x1‖22, ‖x2‖22, ..., ‖xn‖22)T . With a Lagrange multipliers λ, the one dimensional situation of problem (7) can be rewritten as\nmin zT ppT 1− λ(pT p− 1) (8)\nFinally, the minimization problem (7) reduces to finding the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the problem 1zT p = λp. Because the matrix 1zT has rank\none, there is only one nonzero eigenvalue ∑n\ni=1 ‖xi‖22, which implies λ = 0. Hence, for the P satisfying problem (7) with arbitrary column number less than n, we have zTPPT 1 = 0. It is equivalent to\nn∑ i=1 ‖xi‖22 d∆ii = 0 (9)\nGenerally, in real-world data set, ‖xi‖23 6= 0 always holds, thus, the P minimizing the first part of the objective function (6) has the propertyD∆ = 0. Meanwhile the set of all P with the property D∆ = 0 is the solution of Eq. (7).\nThe matrix P , which minimizes the second part of the objective function (6), is given by the maximum eigenvalue to the eigen problem:\n(XXT )p = λp⇒ 1XXT p = λ1p (10)\nAs the dataX has zero mean, we have λ1p = 1XXT p = 0. Therefore, for the maximum eigenvalue which is larger than 0, the corresponding eigenvector always satisfies 1p = 0. Let the minimum solution of the second part of problem (6) be P = (p1, p2, ..., pt). We have\n1TP = 0⇒ 1TPPT = 0⇒ d∆ii = 0 (11)\nwhich means that the property D∆ = 0 holds for the optimal solution of the second part of (6) and the solution is in the set of the solution of Eq. (7). Therefore the solution of the second part of Eq. (6) can also optimize the object function (7) and the solution of the optimization problem (6) makes D∆ equal to 0. The objective function (6) can be reduced to\nP = arg max PTP=I\ntr(PTXXTP ) (12)\nwhich has the solution as singular value decomposition of X with complexity relies on d rather than n. We obtain the intermediate affinity matrix ∆ = PPT from the distribution of origin data with similarity and dissimilarity information. The graph Laplacian of ∆ is L∆ = D∆ −∆ = −∆.\nTo mitigate the impact of noise and rank reducing problem, we apply sparsification to ∆. We will discuss the sparsification further in Section 2.4.\nAlgorithm 1 Adaptive Affinity Matrix Input:\nData points X ∈ Rn×d; cluster number c; neighborhood size k; reduced dimension m;\nOutput: Mahalanobis metric M and linear projection A.\n1: Construct the k-NN heat kernelW , the corresponding diagonal weight matrix D and the Laplacian matrix L; 2: Compute the P with orthogonal columns according to Eq.

      "text" : "In this section, we formulate a naive linear spectral clustering and provide the final adaptive affinity matrix.\nWith the intermediate affinity matrix ∆, we can solve the following problem for a linear projection A:\na = arg min aT a=1\ntr(aTXT (L+ L∆)Xa) (13)\nwhere a is the one-dimension case of A and L + L∆ is the combination of the Laplacian of k-NN heat kernel and the intermediate affinity matrix. The projection vector a is given by the minimum eigenvalue of the eigen problem:\nXT (L−∆)Xa = λa (14)\nSubsequently, to compute L∆ of Eq. (13) given A, we rewrite the affinity optimization problem with the linear projection matrix A as we did in Eq. (6)\nP = arg min PTP=I\n( c+ tr(ATXTD∆XA)\n+ tr(ATXT (−PPT )XA) ) (15)\nwhere we assume the final adaptive affinity matrix to be ∆ = PPT and c = tr(ATXTLXA). The property D∆ = 0 still holds, because of the zero mean of XA. Therefore, Eq. (15) reduces to\nP = arg max PTP=I\ntr(PTXAATXTP ) (16)\nThis can be solved by singular value decomposition of matrix XA and taking the left-singular vectors which correspond to the largest singular values. We apply sparsification on the adaptive affinity matrix ∆ = PPT obtained from Eq. (16) and attain the sparse affinity matrix.\nIntuitively, we can iterate Eq. (13) and Eq. (16) to minimize the value of objective function. However, as Fig. 1(a)\nshows, the adaptive affinity matrix with only once iteration performs well in practice and the continuing iterations show no remarkable outperformance.\nSince the weight of nodes in the graph plays an important role in some algorithms and methods based on Normalized Cuts [15] like LPP has the constraint relying on D∆. In our approach we have D∆ = 0, therefore we add the weight matrix D computed from the k-NN heat kernel to our affinity matrix. Finally, we replace the affinity matrix in LPP with the matrix ∆ + D to get the linear projection A and the metric matrix M = ATA."

      "heading" : "2.4. Sparsification Strategy",
      "text" : "From the optimization problem (12) and (16), we can observe that the matrices XXT and XAATXT are both low-rank matrix. Seeing that the solution of the optimization problem mentioned above is based on the singular value decomposition, this low-rank fact will result in that the column number of the solution P could be far less than the rank of XXT and XAATXT . This process will produce a low-rank affinity matrix which leads to a progressively rank decreasing in our approach. To prevent the rank decreasing happening, we implement sparsification in our approach. The sparsification strategy may mitigate the problem of noise edges as well.\nFig. 1 justifies our sparsification procedure by demonstrating the histogram of the magnitude of the final adaptive affinity matrix obtained from Eq. (16) without sparsification. We can observe that most elements of the affinity matrix concentrate in the range with small magnitude, and the sparsification procedure may reserve a portion of the affinity elements which are more representative.\nInspired by the thought of k-NN heat kernel, we sort all the elements of affinity matrix ∆ by decreasing magnitude and only reserve the first t elements. We consider that the parameter t is better to be in inverse proportion to the number of clusters, in which case the average elements reserved for each cluster will be proportionate to the number of data points in each cluster. The t is selected by following equation:\nt = bn 2\nαc c (17)\nwhere b·c is the floor function, n2 is the number of elements in ∆, c is the number of clusters and α is a coefficient.\nWe set α to be 2.5 for the first sparsification in the computation of the intermediate affinity matrix and set α to be 5 for the second sparsification in the computation of the final adaptive affinity matrix. The α is decided by a rough parameter search, and it gives a stable performance in most data sets.\nWe summarize our algorithm in Algorithm 1. We set reduced dimension m to be the same as the number of classes"

Tab. 1 gives the average and the maximal accuracy of 100 rounds k-Means of each model. From Tab. 1, we can observe that superiority of AdaAM on the task of the unsupervised metric learning. In most case, AdaAM performs much better than the other approaches. Our approach attains four best results of the average accuracy and five best maximal accuracy on five data sets. We can also observe that the proposed AdaAM decisively outperforms other five methods on ExYaleB data set. Different from the other data sets, the image data in ExYaleB are properly aligned and under different illumination. This difference makes some images more similar to the image in different class under the same illumination, which result in a high rank affinity matrix. Our approach is based on a low rank approximation of the optimal affinity matrix with the ability to handle such noises in the affinity matrix.\nSince the neighborhood size k selection criteria is fixed in the experiment of accuracy, which may cause the loss of the best performance, we show the trend of accuracy according to the size of neighborhood in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows that AdaAM attains the best result in most cases and the sensitivity to the size of neighborhood is better or comparable to the other models. Since our approach is based on the low rank approximation of the optimal affinity matrix, it requires more information from the pairwise similarity. Hence, for small k, baseline methods are sometimes better than our approach.\nFig. 3 illustrates the efficiency of AdaAM by the semilog graph of execution time with different number of data points selected from MNIST. It can be observed that our ap-\nproach is a inexpensive algorithm in practice with much lower time consumption to PCAN-kMeans, ClustRF-Bi and DN.

Only a little work of spectral clustering focuses on the explicit linear map which can be viewed as the distance metric learning. In practice, the selection of the affinity matrix exhibits a tremendous impact on the unsupervised learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method, dubbed Adaptive Affinity Matrix (AdaAM), to learn an adaptive affinity matrix and derive a distance metric. We assume the affinity matrix to be positive semidefinite with ability to quantify the pairwise dissimilarity. Our method is based on posing the optimization of objective function as a spectral decomposition problem. The provided matrix can be regarded as the optimal representation of pairwise relationship on the manifold. Extensive experiments on a number of image data sets show the effectiveness and efficiency of AdaAM.",
