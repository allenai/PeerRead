      "text" : "Universal schema builds a knowledge base (KB) of entities and relations by jointly embedding all relation types from input KBs as well as textual patterns expressing relations from raw text. In most previous applications of universal schema, each textual pattern is represented as a single embedding, preventing generalization to unseen patterns. Recent work employs a neural network to capture patterns’ compositional semantics, providing generalization to all possible input text. In response, this paper introduces significant further improvements to the coverage and flexibility of universal schema relation extraction: predictions for entities unseen in training and multilingual transfer learning to domains with no annotation. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, outperforming the top system from TAC 2013 slot-filling using no handwritten patterns or additional annotation. We also consider a multilingual setting in which English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but Spanish text does not. Despite having no annotation for Spanish data, we train an accurate predictor, with additional improvements obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. Furthermore, we find that multilingual training improves English relation extraction accuracy. Our approach is thus suited to broad-coverage automated knowledge base construction in a variety of languages and domains."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The goal of automatic knowledge base construction (AKBC) is to build a structured knowledge base (KB) of facts using a noisy corpus of raw text evidence, and perhaps an initial seed KB to be augmented (Carlson et al., 2010; Suchanek et al., 2007; Bollacker et al., 2008). AKBC supports downstream reasoning at a high level about extracted entities and their relations, and thus has broad-reaching applications to a variety of domains.\nOne challenge in AKBC is aligning knowledge from a structured KB with a text corpus in order to perform supervised learning through distant supervision. Universal schema (Riedel et al., 2013) along with its extensions (Yao et al., 2013; Gardner et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2015; Rocktaschel et al., 2015), avoids alignment by jointly embedding KB relations, entities, and surface text patterns. This propagates information between KB annotation and corresponding textual evidence.\nThe above applications of universal schema express each text relation as a distinct item to be embedded. This harms its ability to generalize to inputs not precisely seen at training time. Recently, Toutanova et al. (2015) addressed this issue by embedding text patterns using a deep sentence encoder, which captures the compositional semantics of textual relations and allows for prediction on inputs never seen before.\nThis paper further expands the coverage abilities of universal schema relation extraction by introducing techniques for forming predictions for new entities unseen in training and even for new domains with no associated annotation. In the extreme example of domain adaptation to a completely new language, we may have limited linguistic resources or labeled data such as treebanks, and only rarely a KB with adequate coverage. Our method performs multilingual transfer learning, providing a predictive model for a language with no coverage in an existing KB, by leveraging common representations for shared entities across text corpora. As depicted in Figure 1, we simply require that one language have an available KB of seed facts. We can further improve our models by tying a small set of word embeddings across languages using only simple knowledge about word-level translations, learning to embed semantically similar textual patterns from different languages into the same latent space.\nIn extensive experiments on the TAC Knowledge Base Population (KBP) slot-filling benchmark we outperform the top 2013 system with an F1 score of 40.7 and perform relation extraction in Spanish with no labeled data or direct overlap between the Spanish training corpus and\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 39\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nM ar\n2 01\nthe training KB, demonstrating that our approach is wellsuited for broad-coverage AKBC in low-resource languages and domains.

We refer to subjects and objects as entities. This work focuses solely on extracting binary relations, though many of our techniques generalize naturally to unary prediction. Generally, for example in Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), higher-order relations are expressed in terms of collections of binary relations.\nWe now describe prior work on approaches to AKBC. They all aim to predict (s, r, o) triples, but differ in terms of: (1) input data leveraged, (2) types of annotation required, (3) definition of relation label schema, and (4) whether they are capable of predicting relations for entities unseen in the training data. Note that all of these methods require pre-processing to detect entities, which may result in additional KB construction errors."

In the case of knowledge graph completion, the task is akin to link prediction, assuming an initial set of (s, r, o) triples. See Nickel et al. (2015) for a review. No accompanying text data is necessary, since links can be predicted using properties of the graph, such as transitivity. In order to generalize well, prediction is often posed as low-rank matrix or tensor factorization. A variety of model variants have been suggested, where the probability of a given edge existing depends on a multi-linear form (Nickel et al., 2011; Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2015; Yang\net al., 2015; Bordes et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015), or non-linear interactions between s, r, and o (Socher et al., 2013). Other approaches model the compositionality of multi-hop paths, typically for question answering (Bordes et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015; Neelakantan et al., 2015)."

      "text" : "Here, the training data consist of (1) a text corpus, and (2) a KB of seed facts with provenance, i.e. supporting evidence, in the corpus. Given individual an individual sentence, and pre-specified entities, a classifier predicts whether the sentence expresses a relation from a target schema. To train such a classifier, KB facts need to be aligned with supporting evidence in the text, but this is often challenging. For example, not all sentences containing Barack and Michelle Obama state that they are married. A variety of one-shot and iterative methods have addressed the alignment problem (Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Yao et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Zeng et al., 2015). An additional degree of freedom in these approaches is whether they classify individual sentences or predicting at the corpus level by aggregating information from all sentences containing a given pair of entities before prediction. The former approach is often preferable in practice, due to the simplicity of independently classifying individual sentences and the ease of associating each prediction with a provenance. Prior work has applied deep learning to small-scale relation extraction problems, where functional relationships are detected between common nouns (Li et al., 2015; dos Santos et al., 2015). Xu et al. (2015) apply an LSTM to a parse path, while Zeng et al. (2015) use a CNN on the raw text, with a special temporal pooling operation to separately embed the text around each entity."

      "text" : "In the previous two approaches, prediction is carried out with respect to a fixed schema R of possible relations r. This may overlook salient relations that are expressed in the text but do not occur in the schema. In response, open-domain information extraction (OpenIE) lets the text speak for itself: R contains all possible patterns of text occurring between entities s and o (Banko et al., 2007; Etzioni et al., 2008; Yates and Etzioni, 2007). These are obtained by filtering and normalizing the raw text. The approach offers impressive coverage, avoids issues of distant supervision, and provides a useful exploratory tool. On the other hand, OpenIE predictions are difficult to use in downstream tasks that expect information from a fixed schema.\nTable 1 provides examples of OpenIE patterns. The examples in row two and three illustrate relational contexts\nfor which similarity is difficult to be captured by an OpenIE approach because of their syntactically complex constructions. This motivates the technique in Section 3.2, which uses a deep architecture applied to raw tokens, instead of rigid rules for normalizing text to obtain patterns."

      "heading" : "2.4 Universal Schema",
      "text" : "When applying Universal Schema (Riedel et al., 2013) (USchema) to relation extraction, we combine the OpenIE and link-prediction perspectives. By jointly modeling both OpenIE patterns and the elements of a target schema, the method captures broader relational structure than multi-class classification approaches that just model the target schema. Furthermore, the method avoids the distant supervision alignment difficulties of Section 2.2.\nRiedel et al. (2013) augment a knowledge graph from a seed KB with additional edges corresponding to OpenIE patterns observed in the corpus. Even if the user does not seek to predict these new edges, a joint model over all edges can exploit regularities of the OpenIE edges to improve modeling of the labels from the target schema.\nThe data still consist of (s, r, o) triples, which can be predicted using link-prediction techniques such as lowrank factorization. Riedel et al. (2013) explore a variety of approximations to the 3-mode (s, r, o) tensor. One such probabilistic model is:\nP ((s, r, o)) = σ ( u>s,ovr ) , (1)\nwhere σ() is a sigmoid function, us,o is an embedding of the entity pair (s, o), and vr is an embedding of the relation r, which may be an OpenIE pattern or a relation from the target schema. All of the exposition and results in this paper use this factorization, though many of the techniques we present later could be applied easily to\nthe other factorizations described in Riedel et al. (2013). Note that learning unique embeddings for OpenIE relations does not guarantee that similar patterns, such as the final two in Table 1, will be embedded similarly.\nAs with most of the techniques in Section 2.1, the data only consist of positive examples of edges. The absence of an annotated edge does not imply that the edge is false. In fact, we seek to predict some of these missing edges as true. Riedel et al. (2013) employ the Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) approach of Rendle et al. (2009), which does not explicitly model unobserved edges as negative, but instead seeks to rank the probability of observed triples above unobserved triples.\nRecently, Toutanova et al. (2015) extended USchema to not learn individual pattern embeddings vr, but instead to embed text patterns using a deep architecture applied to word tokens. This shares statistical strength between OpenIE patterns with similar words. We leverage this approach in Section 3.2. Additional work has modeled the regularities of multi-hop paths through knowledge graph augmented with text patterns (Lao et al., 2011; Lao et al., 2012; Gardner et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2015)."

Others (Mikolov et al., 2013; Faruqui et al., 2014) align separate singlelanguage embedding models using a word-level dictionary. Mikolov et al. (2013) use translation pairs to learn a linear transform from one embedding space to another.\nHowever, very little work exists on multilingual relation extraction. Faruqui and Kumar (2015) perform multilingual OpenIE relation extraction by projecting all languages to English using Google translate. However, as explained in Section 2.3 the OpenIE paradigm is not amenable to prediction within a fixed schema. Further, their approach does not generalize to low-resource languages where translation is unavailable – while we use translation dictionaries to improve our results, our experiments demonstrate that our method is effective even without this resource."

At test time we score compatibility between embedded KB relations and encoded textual patterns using cosine similarity.

This allows us to avoid errors from aligning distant supervision to the corpus, but is more deployable for real world applications. It also provides opportunities in Section 3.4 to improve multilingual AKBC.\nWe produce predictions using a very simple approach: (1) scan the corpus and extract a large quantity of triplets (s, rtext, o), where rtext is an OpenIE pattern. For each triplet, if the similarity between the embedding of rtext and the embedding of a target relation rschema is above some threshold, we predict the triplet (s, rschema, o), and its provenance is the input sentence containing (s, rtext, o). We refer to this technique as pattern scoring. In our experiments, we use the cosine distance between the vectors (Figure 2). In Section 7.3, we discuss details for how to make this distance welldefined."

      "text" : "The pattern scoring approach is subject to an additional cold start problem: input data may contain patterns unseen in training. This section describes a method for us-\ning USchema to train a relation classifier that can take arbitrary context tokens (Section 2.3) as input.\nFortunately, the cold start problem for context tokens is more benign than that of entities since we can exploit statistical regularities of text: similar sequences of context tokens should be embedded similarly. Therefore, following Toutanova et al. (2015), we embed raw context tokens compositionally using a deep architecture. Unlike Riedel et al. (2013), this requires no manual rules to map text to OpenIE patterns and can embed any possible input string. The modified USchema likelihood is:\nP ((s, r, o)) = σ ( u>s,oEncoder(r) ) . (2)\nHere, if r is raw text, then Encoder(r) is parameterized by a deep architecture. If r is from the target schema, Encoder(r) is a produced by a lookup table (as in traditional USchema). Though such an encoder increases the computational cost of test-time prediction over straightforward pattern matching, evaluating a deep architecture can be done in large batches in parallel on a GPU.\nBoth convolutional networks (CNNs) and recurrent networks (RNNs) are reasonable encoder architectures, and we consider both in our experiments. CNNs have been useful in a variety of NLP applications (Collobert et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014). Unlike Toutanova et al. (2015), we also consider RNNs, specifically Long-Short Term Memory Networks\n(LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTMs have proven successful in a variety of tasks requiring encoding sentences as vectors (Sutskever et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2014). In our experiments, LSTMs outperform CNNs.\nThere are two key differences between our sentence encoder and that of Toutanova et al. (2015). First, we use the encoder at test time, since we process the context tokens for held-out data. On the other hand, Toutanova et al. (2015) adopt the transductive approach where the encoder is only used to help train better representations for the relations in the target schema; it is ignored when forming predictions. Second, we apply the encoder to the raw text between entities, while Toutanova et al. (2015) first perform syntactic dependency parsing on the data and then apply an encoder to the path between the two entities in the parse tree. We avoid parsing, since we seek to perform multilingual AKBC, and many languages lack linguistic resources such as treebanks. Even parsing nonnewswire English text, such as tweets, is extremely challenging."

      "text" : "Despite the coverage advantages of using a deep sentence encoder, separately embedding each OpenIE pattern, as in Riedel et al. (2013), has key advantages. In practice, we have found that many high-precision patterns occur quite frequently. For these, there is sufficient data to model them with independent embeddings per pattern, which imposes minimal inductive bias on the relationship between patterns. Furthermore, some discriminative phrases are idiomatic, i.e.. their meaning is not constructed compositionally from their constituents. For these, a sentence encoder may be inappropriate.\nTherefore, pattern embeddings and deep token-based encoders have very different strengths and weaknesses. One values specificity, and models the head of the text distribution well, while the other has high coverage and captures the tail. In experimental results, we demonstrate that an ensemble of both models performs substantially better than either in isolation."

      "text" : "The models described in previous two sections provide broad-coverage relation extraction that can generalize to all possible input entities and text patterns, while avoiding error-prone alignment of distant supervision to a corpus. Next, we describe techniques for an even more challenging generalization task: relation classification for input sentences in completely different languages.\nTraining a sentence-level relation classifier, either using the alignment-based techniques of Section 2.2, or the alignment-free method of Section 3.1, requires an avail-\nable KB of seed facts that have supporting evidence in the corpus. Unfortunately, available KBs have low overlap with corpora in many languages, since KBs have cultural and geographical biases. In response, we perform multilingual relation extraction by jointly modeling a highresource language, such as English, and an alternative language with no KB annotation. This approach provides transfer learning of a predictive model to the alternative language, and generalizes naturally to modeling more languages.\nExtending the training technique of Section 3.1 to corpora in multiple languages can be achieved by factorizing a matrix that mixes data from a KB and from the two corpora. In Figure 1 we split the entities of a multilingual training corpus into sets depending on whether they have annotation in a KB and what corpora they appear in. We can perform transfer learning of a relation extractor to the low-resource language if there are entity pairs occurring in the two corpora, even if there is no KB annotation for these pairs. Note that we do not use the entity pair embeddings at test time: They are used only to bridge the languages during training. To form predictions in the low-resource language, we can simply apply the pattern scoring approach of Section 3.1.\nIn Section 5, we demonstrate that jointly learning models for English and Spanish, with no annotation for the Spanish data, provides fairly accurate Spanish AKBC, and even improves the performance of the English model. Note that we are not performing zero-shot learning of a Spanish model (Larochelle et al., 2008).

This approach is sub-optimal, however, because each sentence encoder will have a separate matrix of word embeddings for its vocabulary, despite the fact that there may be considerable shared structure between the languages. In response, we propose a straightforward method for tying the parameters of the sentence encoders across languages.\nDrawing on the dictionary-based techniques described in Section 2.5, we first obtain a list of word-word translation pairs between the languages using a translation dictionary. The first layer of our deep text encoder consists of a word embedding lookup table. For the aligned word types, we use a single cross-lingual embedding.

Clearly, grounding the Spanish data using a translation dictionary provides much better Spanish word representations. These improvements are complementary to the baseline USchema model, and yield impressive results when ensembled.\nIn addition to embedding semantically similar phrases from English and Spanish to have high similarity, our models also learn high-quality multilingual word embeddings. In Table 5 we compare Spanish nearest neighbors of English query words learned by the LSTM with dictionary ties versus the LSTM with no ties, using no unsupervised pre-training for the embeddings. Both approaches jointly embed Spanish and English word types, using shared entity embeddings, but the dictionary-tied model learns qualitatively better multilingual embeddings."

      "heading" : "5.3 USchema vs LSTM",
      "text" : "We further analyze differences between USchema and LSTM in order to better understand why ensembling the models results in the best performing system. Figure 3 depicts precision-recall curves for the two models on the 2013 slot-filling task. As observed in earlier results, the LSTM achieves higher recall at the loss of\nsome precision, whereas USchema can make more precise predictions at a lower threshold for recall. In Figure 4 we observe evidence for these different precisionrecall trade-offs: USchema scores higher in terms of F1 on shorter patterns whereas the LSTM scores higher on longer patterns. As one would expect, USchema successfully matches more short patterns than the LSTM, making more precise predictions at the cost of being unable to predict on patterns unseen during training. The LSTM can predict using any text between entities observed at test time, gaining recall at the loss of precision. Combining the two models makes the most of their strengths and weaknesses, leading to the highest overall F1.\nQualitative analysis of our English models also suggests that our encoder-based models (LSTM) extract relations based on a wide range of semantically similar patterns that the pattern-matching model (USchema) is unable to score due to a lack of exact string match in the test data. For example, Table 6 lists three examples of the per:children relation that the LSTM finds which USchema does not, as well as three patterns that USchema does find. Though the LSTM patterns are all semantically and syntactically similar, they each contain different specific noun phrases, e.g. Lori, four children, toddler daughter, Lee and Albert, etc. Because these specific nouns weren’t seen during training, USchema fails to find these patterns whereas the LSTM learns to ignore the specific nouns in favor of the overall pattern, that of a parent-child relationship in an obituary. USchema is limited to finding the relations represented by patterns observed during training, which limits the patterns matched at test-time to short and common patterns; all the USchema patterns matched at test time were similar to those listed in Table 6: variants of ’s son, ’."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "By jointly embedding English and Spanish corpora along with a KB, we can train an accurate Spanish relation extraction model using no direct annotation for relations in the Spanish data. This approach has the added benefit of providing significant accuracy improvements for the English model, outperforming the top system on the 2013 TAC KBC slot filling task, without using the hand-coded rules or additional annotations of alternative systems. By using deep sentence encoders, we can perform prediction for arbitrary input text and for entities unseen in training. Sentence encoders also provides opportunities to improve cross-lingual transfer learning by sharing word embeddings across languages. In future work we will apply this model to many more languages and domains besides newswire text. We would also like to avoid the entity detection problem by using a deep architecture to both identify entity mentions and identify relations between them."

Entity pair embeddings for the baseline USchema model are randomly\ninitialized. For the models with LSTM and CNN text encoders, entity pair embeddings are initialized using vectors from the baseline USchema model. This performs better than random initialization. We perform `2 gradient clipping to 1 on all models. Universal Schema uses a batch size of 1024 while the CNN and LSTM use 128. All models are optimized using ADAM (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with = 1e − 8, β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999 with a learning rate of .001 for USchema and .0001 for CNN and LSTM.

However, such a distance is not well-defined, since the model was trained using inner products between entity vectors and rela-\ntion vectors, not between two relation vectors. The US likelihood is invariant to invertible transformations of the latent coordinate system, since σ ( u>s,ovr ) =\nσ ( (A>us,o) >A−1vr )\nfor any invertible A. When taking inner products between two v terms, however, the implicit A−1 terms do not cancel out. We found that this issue can be minimized, and high quality predictive accuracy can be achieved, simply by using sufficient `2 regularization to avoid implicitly learning an A that substantially stretches the space."

      "text" : "We replace tokens occurring less than 5 times in the corpus with UNK and normalize all digits to # (e.g. Oct11-1988 becomes Oct-##-####). For each sentence, we then extract all entity pairs and the text between them as surface patterns, ignoring patterns longer than 20 tokens. This results in 48 million English ‘relations’. In Section 7.6, we describe a technique for normalizing the surface patterns. We filter out entity pairs that occurred less than 10 times in the data and extract the largest connected component in this entity co-occurrence graph. This is necessary for the baseline US model, as otherwise learning decouples into independent problems per connected component. Though the components are connected when using sentence encoders, we use only a single component to facilitate a fair comparison between modeling approaches. We add the distant supervision training facts from the RelationFactory system, i.e. 352,236 entitypair-relation tuples obtained from Freebase and high precision seed patterns. The final training data contains a set of 3,980,164 (KB and openIE) facts made up of 549,760 unique entity pairs, 1,285,258 unique relations and 62,841 unique tokens.\nWe perform the same preprocessing on the Spanish data, resulting in 34 million raw surface patterns between entities. We then filter patterns that never occur with an entity pair found in the English data. This yields 860,502 Spanish patterns. Our multilingual model is trained on a combination of these Spanish patterns, the English surface patterns, and the distant supervision data described above. We learn word embeddings for 39,912 unique Spanish word types. After parameter tying for translation pairs (Section 3.5), there are 33,711 additional Spanish words not tied to English."

We then filter duplicates and translations resulting in multiword phrases. We also remove English past participles\n(ending in -ed) as we found the Google translation interprets these as adjectives (e.g., ‘she read the borrowed book’ rather than ‘she borrowed the book’) and much of the relational structure in language we seek to model is captured by verbs. This resulted in 6201 translation pairs that occurred in our text corpus.

This shortening performs slightly better than whole patterns. LSTM and CNN variants use the entire sequence of tokens."

In most previous applications of universal schema, each textual pattern is represented as a single embedding, preventing generalization to unseen patterns. Recent work employs a neural network to capture patterns’ compositional semantics, providing generalization to all possible input text. In response, this paper introduces significant further improvements to the coverage and flexibility of universal schema relation extraction: predictions for entities unseen in training and multilingual transfer learning to domains with no annotation. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, outperforming the top system from TAC 2013 slot-filling using no handwritten patterns or additional annotation. We also consider a multilingual setting in which English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but Spanish text does not. Despite having no annotation for Spanish data, we train an accurate predictor, with additional improvements obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. Furthermore, we find that multilingual training improves English relation extraction accuracy. Our approach is thus suited to broad-coverage automated knowledge base construction in a variety of languages and domains.",
