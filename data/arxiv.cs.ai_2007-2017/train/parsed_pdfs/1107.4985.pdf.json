      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Nonlinear probabilistic modeling of high dimensional time series data is a key challenge for the machine learning community. A standard approach is to simultaneously apply a nonlinear dimensionality reduction to the data whilst governing the latent space with a nonlinear temporal prior. The key difficulty for such approaches is that analytic marginalization of the latent space is typically intractable. Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches can also be problematic as latent trajectories are strongly correlated making efficient sampling a challenge. One promising approach to these time series has been to extend the Gaussian process latent variable model [1, 2] with a dynamical prior for the latent space and seek a maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for the latent points [3, 4, 5]. Ko and Fox [6] further extend these models for fully Bayesian filtering in a robotics setting. We refer to this class of dynamical models based on the GP-LVM as Gaussian process dynamical systems (GPDS). However, the use of a MAP approximation for training these models presents key problems. Firstly, since the latent variables are not marginalised, the parameters of the dynamical prior cannot be optimized without the risk of overfitting. Further, the dimensionality of the latent space cannot be determined by the model: adding further dimensions always increases the likelihood of the data. In this paper we build on recent developments in variational approximations for Gaussian processes [7, 8] to introduce a variational Gaussian process dynamical system (VGPDS) where latent variables are approximately marginalized through optimization of a rigorous lower bound on the marginal likelihood. As well as providing a principled approach to handling uncertainty in the latent space, this allows both the parameters of the latent dynamical process and the dimensionality of the latent space to be determined. The approximation enables the application of our model to time series containing millions of dimensions and thousands of time points. We illustrate this by modeling human motion capture data and high dimensional video sequences.\nar X\niv :1\n10 7.\n49 85\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 2"

      "text" : "Assume a multivariate times series dataset {yn, tn}Nn=1, where yn ∈ RD is a data vector observed at time tn ∈ R+. We are especially interested in cases where each yn is a high dimensional vector and, therefore, we assume that there exists a low dimensional manifold that governs the generation of the data. Specifically, a temporal latent function x(t) ∈ RQ (with Q D), governs an intermediate hidden layer when generating the data, and the dth feature from the data vector yn is then produced from xn = x(tn) according to\nynd = fd(xn) + nd , nd ∼ N (0, β−1), (1)\nwhere fd(x) is a latent mapping from the low dimensional space to dth dimension of the observation space and β is the inverse variance of the white Gaussian noise. We do not want to make strong assumptions about the functional form of the latent functions (x, f).1 Instead we would like to infer them in a fully Bayesian non-parametric fashion using Gaussian processes [9]. Therefore, we assume that x is a multivariate Gaussian process indexed by time t and f is a different multivariate Gaussian process indexed by x, and we write\nxq(t) ∼ GP(0, kx(ti, tj)), q = 1, . . . , Q, (2) fd(x) ∼ GP(0, kf (xi,xj)), d = 1, . . . , D. (3)\nHere, the individual components of the latent function x are taken to be independent sample paths drawn from a Gaussian process with covariance function kx(ti, tj). Similarly, the components of f are independent draws from a Gaussian process with covariance function kf (xi,xj). These covariance functions, parametrized by parameters θx and θf respectively, play very distinct roles in the model. More precisely, kx determines the properties of each temporal latent function xq(t). For instance, the use of an Ornstein-Uhlbeck covariance function yields a Gauss-Markov process for xq(t), while the squared-exponential kernel gives rise to very smooth and non-Markovian processes. In our experiments, we will focus on the squared exponential covariance function (RBF), the Matern 3/2 which is only once differentiable, and a periodic covariance function [9, 10] which can be used when data exhibit strong periodicity. These kernel functions take the form:\nkx(rbf) (ti , tj ) = σ 2 rbfe − (\nti−tj) 2\n(2l2t ) , kx(mat) (ti, tj) = σ 2 mat\n( 1 +\n√ 3|ti − tj | lt\n) e − √ 3|ti−tj | lt ,\nkx(per) (ti , tj ) = σ 2 pere − 12 sin2( 2πT (ti−tj)) lt . (4)\nThe covariance function kf determines the properties of the latent mapping f that maps each low dimensional variable xn to the observed vector yn. We wish this mapping to be a non-linear but smooth, and thus a suitable choice is the squared exponential covariance function\nkf (xi,xj) = σ 2 arde\n− 12 ∑Q q=1 wq(xi,q−xj ,q) 2\n, (5)\nwhich assumes a different scale wq for each latent dimension. This, as in the variational Bayesian formulation of the GP-LVM [8], enables an automatic relevance determination procedure (ARD), i.e. it allows Bayesian training to “switch off” unnecessary dimensions by driving the values of the corresponding scales to zero.\nThe matrix Y ∈ RN×D will collectively denote all observed data so that its nth row corresponds to the data point yn. Similarly, the matrix F ∈ RN×D will denote the mapping latent variables, i.e. fnd = fd(xn), associated with observations Y from (1). Ana usly, X ∈ RN×Q will store all low dimensional latent variables xnq = xq(tn). Further, we will refer to columns of these matrices by the vectors yd, fd,xq ∈ RN . Given the latent variables we assume independence over the data features, and given time we assume independence over latent dimensions to give\np(Y, F,X|t) = p(Y |F )p(F |X)p(X|t) = D∏ d=1 p(yd|fd)p(fd|X ) Q∏ q=1 p(xq|t), (6)\n1To simplify our notation, we often write x instead of x(t) and f instead of f(x). Later we also use a similar convention for the kernel functions by often writing them as kf and kx.\nwhere t ∈ RN and p(yd|fd) is a Gaussian likelihood function term defined from (1). Further, p(fd|X ) is a marginal GP prior such that\np(fd|X ) = N (fd|0,KNN ), (7)\nwhere KNN = kf (X,X) is the covariance matrix defined by the kernel function kf and similarly p(xq|t) is the marginal GP prior associated with the temporal function xq(t),\np(xq|t) = N (xq|0,Kt) , (8)\nwhere Kt = kx(t, t) is the covariance matrix obtained by evaluating the kernel function kx on the observed times t.\nBayesian inference using the above model poses a huge computational challenge as, for instance, marginalization of the variables X , that appear non-linearly inside the kernel matrix KNN , is troublesome. Practical approaches that have been considered until now (e.g. [5, 3]) marginalise out only F and seek a MAP solution for X . In the next section we describe how efficient variational approximations can be applied to marginalize X by extending the framework of [8]."

      "text" : "The key difficulty with the Bayesian approach is propagating the prior density p(X|t) through the nonlinear mapping. This mapping gives the expressive power to the model, but simultaneously renders the associated marginal likelihood,\np(Y |t) = ∫ p(Y |F )p(F |X)p(X|t)dXdF, (9)\nintractable. We now invoke the variational Bayesian methodology to approximate the integral. Following a standard procedure [11], we introduce a variational distribution q(Θ) and compute the Jensen’s lower bound Fv on the logarithm of (9),\nFv(q,θ) = ∫ q(Θ) log\np(Y |F )p(F |X)p(X |t) q(Θ) dXdF, (10)\nwhere θ denotes the model’s parameters. However, the above form of the lower bound is problematic becauce X (in the GP term p(F |X)) appears non-linearly inside the kernel matrix KNN making the integration over X difficult. As shown in [8], this intractability is removed by applying the “data augmentation” principle. More precisely, we augment the joint probability model in (6) by includingM extra samples of the GP latent mapping f , known as inducing points, so that um ∈ RD is such a sample. The inducing points are evaluated at a set of pseudo-inputs X̃ ∈ RM×Q. The augmented joint probability density takes the form\np(Y, F, U,X, X̃|t) = D∏ d=1 p(yd|fd)p(fd|ud,X )p(ud|X̃)p(X|t), (11)\nwhere p(ud|X̃) is a zero-mean Gaussian with a covariance matrix KMM constructed using the same function as for the GP prior (7). By dropping X̃ from our expressions, we write the augmented GP prior analytically (see [9]) as\np(fd|ud, X) = N ( fd|KNMK−1MMud,KNN −KNMK −1 MMKMN ) . (12)\nA key result in [8] is that a tractable lower bound (computed analogously to (10)) can be obtained through the variational density\nq(Θ) = q(F,U,X) = q(F |U,X)q(U)q(X) = D∏ d=1 p(fd|ud, X)q(ud)q(X), (13)\nwhere q(X) = ∏Q q=1N (xq|µq, Sq) and q(ud) is an arbitrary variational distribution. Titsias and Lawrence [8] assume full independence for q(X) and the variational covariances are diagonal matrices. Here, in contrast, the\nposterior over the latent variables will have strong correlations, so Sq is taken to be a N × N full covariance matrix. Optimization of the variational lower bound provides an approximation to the true posterior p(X|Y ) by q(X). In the augmented probability model, the “difficult” term p(F |X) appearing in (10) is now replaced with (12) and, eventually, it cancels out with the first factor of the variational distribution (13) so that F can be marginalised out analytically. Given the above and after breaking the logarithm in (10), we obtain the final form of the lower bound (see supplementary material for more details)\nFv(q,θ) = F̂v − KL(q(X) ‖ p(X|t)), (14)\nwith F̂v = ∫ q(X) log p(Y |F )p(F |X) dXdF . Both terms in (14) are now tractable. Note that the first of the above terms involves the data while the second one only involves the prior. All the information regarding data point correlations is captured in the KL term and the connection with the observations comes through the variational distribution. Therefore, the first term in (14) has the same analytical solution as the one derived in [8]. (14) can be maximized by using gradient-based methods2. However, when not factorizing q(X) across data points yields O(N2) variational parameters to optimize. This issue is addressed in the next section."

However, by reparametrizing our O ( N2 )\nvariational parameters according to the framework described in [12] we can obtain a set of O(N) less correlated variational parameters. Specifically, we first take the derivatives of the variational bound (14) w.r.t. Sq and µq and set them to zero, to find the stationary points,\nSq = ( K−1t + Λq )−1 and µq = Ktµ̄q, (15)\nwhere Λq = −2ϑF̂v (q,θ)ϑSq is a N × N diagonal, positive matrix and µ̄q = ϑF̂v ϑµq is a N−dimensional vector. The above stationary conditions tell us that, since Sq depends on a diagonal matrix Λq , we can reparametrize it using only the N−dimensional diagonal of that matrix, denoted by λq . Then, we can optimise the 2(Q × N) parameters (λq , µ̄q) and obtain the original parameters using (15)."

A given data set may consist of a group of independent observed sequences, each with a different length (e.g. in human motion capture data several walks from a subject). Let, for example, the dataset be a group of S independent sequences ( Y (1), ..., Y (S) ) . We would like our model to capture the underlying commonality of these data. We handle this by allowing a different temporal latent function for each of the independent sequences, so that X(s) is the set of latent variables corresponding to the sequence s. These sets are a priori assumed to be independent since they correspond to separate sequences, i.e. p ( X(1), X(2), ..., X(S) ) = ∏S s=1 p(X\n(s)), where we dropped the conditioning on time for simplicity. This factorisation leads to a block-diagonal structure for the time covariance matrix Kt, where each block corresponds to one sequenece. In this setting, each block of observations Y (s) is generated from its corresponding X(s) according to Y (s) = F (s) + , where the latent function which governs this mapping is shared across all sequences and is Gaussian noise.\n2See supplementary material for more detailed derivation of (14) and for the equations for the gradients. 3We will use the term “variational parameters” to refer only to the parameters of q(X) although the inducing points are also variational\nparameters."

This results in 2,613 separate 59-dimensional frames split into 31 training sequences with an average length of 84 frames each.\nThe model is jointly trained, as explained in section 2.3, on both walks and runs, i.e. the algorithm learns a common latent space for these motions. At test time we investigate the ability of the model to reconstruct test data from a previously unseen sequence given partial information for the test targets. This is tested once by providing only the dimensions which correspond to the body of the subject and once by providing those that correspond to the legs. We compare with results in [15], which used MAP approximations for the dynamical models, and against nearest neighbour. We can also indirectly compare with the binary latent variable model (BLV) of [14] which used a slightly different data preprocessing. We assess the performance using the cumulative error per joint in the scaled space defined in [14] and by the root mean square error in the angle space suggested by [15]. Our model was initialized with nine latent dimensions. We performed two runs, once using\nthe Matern covariance function for the dynamical prior and once using the RBF. From table 1 we see that the variational Gaussian process dynamical system considerably outperforms the other approaches. The appropriate latent space dimensionality for the data was automatically inferred by our models. The model which employed an RBF covariance to govern the dynamics retained four dimensions, whereas the model that used the Matern kept only three. The other latent dimensions were completely switched off by the ARD parameters.

Such sequences are typically preprocessed before modeling to extract informative features and reduce the dimensionality of the problem. Here we work directly with the raw pixel values to demonstrate the ability of the VGPDS to model data with a vast number of features. This also allows us to directly sample video from the learned model.\nFirstly, we used the model to reconstruct partially observed frames from test video sequences4. For the first video discussed here we gave as partial information approximately 50% of the pixels while for the other two we gave approximately 40% of the pixels on each frame. The mean squared error per pixel was measured to compare with the k−nearest neighbour (NN) method, for k ∈ (1, .., 5) (we only present the error achieved for the best choice of k in each case). The datasets considered are the following: firstly, the ‘Missa’ dataset, a standard benchmark used in image processing. This is 103,680-dimensional video, showing a woman talking for 150 frames. The data is challenging as there are translations in the pixel space. We also considered an HD video of dimensionality 9×105 that shows an artificially created scene of ocean waves as well as a 230, 400−dimensional video showing a dog running for 60 frames. The later is approximately periodic in nature, containing several paces from the dog. For the first two videos we used the Matern and RBF kernel respectively to model the dynamics and interpolated to reconstruct blocks of frames chosen from the whole sequence. For the ‘dog’ dataset we constructed a compound kernel kx = kx(rbf) + kx(periodic), where the RBF term is employed to capture any divergence from the approximately periodic pattern. We then used our model to reconstruct the last 7 frames extrapolating beyond the original video. As can be seen in table 2, our method outperformed NN in all cases. The results are also demonstrated visually in figure 1 and the reconstructed videos are available in the supplementary material.\n4‘Missa’ dataset: cipr.rpi.edu. ‘Ocean’: cogfilms.com. ‘Dog’: fitfurlife.com. See details in supplementary. The logo appearing in the ‘dog’ images in the experiments that follow, has been added with post-processing.\nAs can be seen in figure 1, VGPDS predicts pixels which are smoothly connected with the observed image, whereas the NN method cannot fit the predicted pixels in the overall context.\nAs a second task, we used our generative model to create new samples and generate a new video sequence. This is most effective for the ‘dog’ video as the training examples were approximately periodic in nature. The model was trained on 60 frames (time-stamps [t1, t60]) and we generated the new frames which correspond to the next 40 time points in the future. The only input given for this generation of future frames was the time stamp vector, [t61, t100]. The results show a smooth transition from training to test and amongst the test video frames. The resulting video of the dog continuing to run is sharp and high quality. This experiment demonstrates the ability of the model to reconstruct massively high dimensional images without blurring. Frames from the result are shown in figure 2. The full video is available in the supplementary material."

So:\nq(ud) = e 〈logN(yd|ad,β−1Id)〉 q(X)p(ud),\nexactly as in [8]. This is a Gaussian distribution since p(ud) = N (ud|0,KMM ). The complete form of the jensen’s lower bound turns out to be:\nFv(q,θ) = D∑ d=1 F̂d(q,θ)− KL(q ‖ p)\n= D∑ d=1 log\n( (β) N 2 |KMM | 1 2\n(2π) N 2 |βΨ2 + KMM | 1 2\ne− 1 2y T dWyd ) − βψ0\n2 + β 2 Tr ( K−1MMΨ2 ) − Q\n2 log |Kt | −\n1\n2 Q∑ q=1 [ Tr ( Kt −1Sq ) + Tr ( Kt −1µqµ T q )] + 1 2 Q∑ q=1 log |Sq |+ const (32)\nwhere the last line corresponds to the KL term. Also:\nΨ0 = Tr(〈KNN 〉q(X )) , Ψ1 = 〈KNM 〉q(X ) , Ψ2 = 〈KMN KNM 〉q(X ) (33)\nThe Ψ quantities can be computed analytically as in [8]."

      "heading" : "B Derivatives of the variational bound",
      "text" : "Before giving the expressions for the derivatives of the variational bound (30), it should be reminded that the variational parameters µq and Sq (for all qs) have been reparametrised as Sq = ( K−1t + diag(λq) )−1 and µq = Ktµ̄q , where the function diag(·) transforms a vector into a square diagonal matrix and vice versa. Given the above, the set of the parameters to be optimised is (θf ,θx, {µ̄q,λq}Qq=1, X̃ . The gradient w.r.t the inducing points X̃ , however, has exactly the same form as for θf and, therefore, is not presented here. Also notice that from now on we will often use the term “variational parameters” to refer to the new quantities µ̄q and λq .\nSome more notation:\n1. λq is a scalar, an element of the vector λq which, in turn, is the main diagonal of the diagonal matrix Λq .\n2. Sij , Sq;ij the element of Sq found in the i-th row and j-th column.\n3. sq , {Sq;ii}Ni=1, i.e. it is a vector with the diagonal of Sq .\nB.1 Derivatives w.r.t the variational parameters\nϑFv ϑµ̄q = Kt ( ϑF̂ ϑµq − µ̄q ) and ϑFv ϑλq = −(Sq ◦ Sq) ( ϑF̂ ϑsq + 1 2 λq ) . (34)\nwhere:\nF̂(q,θ) ϑµq = −βD 2 ϑΨ0 ϑµq + βTr ( ϑΨT1 ϑµq Y Y TΨ1A −1 )\n+ β 2 Tr [ ϑΨ2 ϑµq ( DK−1MM − β −1DA−1 −A−1ΨT1 Y Y TΨ1A−1 )]\n(35)\nϑF̂(q,θ) ϑSq;i,j = −βD 2 ϑΨ0 ϑSq;i,j + βTr ( ϑΨT1 ϑSq;i,j Y Y TΨ1A −1 )\n+ β 2 Tr [ ϑΨ2 ϑSq;i,j ( DK−1MM − β −1DA−1 −A−1ΨT1 Y Y TΨ1A−1 )]\n(36)\nwith A = β−1KMM + Ψ2.\nB.2 Derivatives w.r.t θ = (θf ,θx) and β Given that the KL term involves only the temporal prior, its gradient w.r.t the parameters θf is zero. Therefore:\nϑFv ϑθf = ϑF̂ ϑθf\n(37)\nwith:\nϑF̂ ϑθf = const− βD 2 ϑΨ0 ϑθf + βTr ( ϑΨT1 ϑθf Y Y TΨ1A −1 )\n+ 1 2 Tr [ ϑKMM ϑθf ( DK−1MM − β −1DA−1 −A−1ΨT1 Y Y TΨ1A−1 − βDK−1MMΨ2K −1 MM )] + β\n2 Tr [ ϑΨ2 ϑθf ( DK−1MM − β −1DA−1 −A−1ΨT1 Y Y TΨ1A−1 )]\n(38)\nThe expression above is identical for the derivatives w.r.t the inducing points. For the gradients w.r.t the β term, we have a similar expression:\nϑF̂ ϑβ = 1 2 [ D ( Tr(K−1MMΨ2) + (N −M)β −1 −Ψ0 ) − Tr(Y Y >) + Tr(A−1Ψ>1 Y Y >Ψ1)\n+β−2DTr(KMMA−1) + β−1Tr ( K−1MMA −1Ψ>1 Y Y >Ψ1A −1) ] (39) In contrast to the above, the term F̂v does involve parameters θx, because it involves the variational parameters that are now reparametrized withKt, which in turn depends on θx. To demonstrate that, we will forget for a moment the reparametrization of Sq and we will express the bound as F (θx, µq(θx)) (where µq(θx) = Ktµ̄q) so as to show explicitly the dependency on the variational mean which is now a function of θx. Our calcu-\nlations must now take into account the term ( ϑF̂(µq) ϑµq )> ϑµq(θx) ϑθx\nthat is what we “miss” when we consider µq(θx) = µq:\nϑFv(θx, µq(θx)) ϑθx = ϑFv(θx,µq) ϑθx + ( ϑF̂(µq) ϑµq )> ϑµq(θx) ϑθx\n= ϑF̂(µq) ϑθx + ϑ(−KL)(θx,µq(θx)) ϑθx + ( ϑF̂(µq) ϑµq )> ϑµq(θx) ϑθx (40)\nWe do the same for Sq and then we can take the resulting equations and replace µq and Sq with their equals so as to take the final expression which only contains µ̄q and λq:\nϑFv(θx, µq(θx), Sq(θx)) ϑθx\n= Tr [[ − 1\n2\n( B̂qKtB̂q + µ̄qµ̄ > q ) + ( I − B̂qKt ) diag ( ϑF̂ ϑsq )( I − B̂qKt )> ]ϑKt ϑθx ]\n+ ( ϑF̂(µq) ϑµq )> ϑKt ϑθx µ̄q (41)\nwhere B̂q = Λ 1 2 q B̃−1q Λ 1 2 q . and B̃q = I + Λ 1 2 q KtΛ 1 2 q . Note that by using this B̃q matrix (which has eigenvalues bounded below by one) we have an expression which, when implemented, leads to more numerically stable computations, as explained in [9] page 45-46."

      "heading" : "C Predictions",
      "text" : "C.1 Predictions given only the test time points To approximate the predictive density, we will need to introduce the underlying latent function values F∗ ∈ RN∗×D (the noisy-free version of Y∗) and the latent variables X∗ ∈ RN∗×Q. We write the predictive density as\np(Y∗|Y ) = ∫ p(Y∗, F∗, X∗|Y∗, Y )dF∗dX∗ = ∫ p(Y∗|F∗)p(F∗|X∗, Y )p(X∗|Y )dF∗dX∗. (42)\nThe term p(F∗|X∗, Y ) is approximated according to q(F∗|X∗) = ∫ ∏\nd∈D p(f∗,d|ud, X∗)q(ud)dud = ∏ d∈D q(f∗,d|X∗), (43)\nwhere q(f∗,d|X∗) is a Gaussian that can be computed analytically.The term p(X∗|Y ) in eq. (42) is approximated by a Gaussian variational distribution q(X∗),\np(X∗|Y ) ≈ ∫ p(X∗|X)q(X)dX = 〈p(X∗|X)〉q(X) = q(X∗) = Q∏ q=1 q(x∗,q), (44)\nwhere p(X∗,q|X) can be found from the conditional GP prior (see [9]). We can then write\nx∗,q = αxq + , (45) where α = K∗NK−1t and ∼ N ( 0,K∗∗ −K∗NK−1t KN∗ ) . Also, Kt = kx(t, t), K∗N = kx(t∗, t) and K∗∗ = kx(t∗t∗). Given the above, we know a priori that (44) is a Gaussian and by taking expectations over q(X) in the r.h.s. of (45) we find the mean and covariance of q(X∗). Substituting for the equivalent forms of µq and Sq from section 2.2 we obtain the final solution\nµx∗,q = k∗N µ̄q (46) var(x∗,q) = k∗∗ − k∗N (Kt + Λ−1q )−1kN∗. (47)\n(42) can then be written as: p(Y∗|Y ) = ∫ p(Y∗|F∗)q(F∗|X∗)q(X∗)dF∗dX∗ = ∫ p(Y∗|F∗) 〈q(F∗|X∗)〉q(X∗) dF∗ (48)\nAlthough the expectation appearing in the above integral is not a Gaussian, its moments can be found analytically [9, 13],\nE(F∗) = B>Ψ∗1 (49) Cov(F∗) = B> (Ψ∗2 −Ψ∗1(Ψ∗1)>)B + Ψ∗0I − Tr [( K−1MM − (KMM + βΨ2) −1 ) Ψ∗2 ] I, (50)\nwhere B = β (KMM + βΨ2) −1 Ψ>1 Y , Ψ ∗ 0 = 〈kf (X∗, X∗)〉, Ψ∗1 = 〈KM∗〉 and Ψ∗2 = 〈KM∗K∗M 〉. All expectations are taken w.r.t. q(X∗) and can be calculated analytically, while KM∗ denotes the cross-covariance matrix between the training inducing inputs X̃ and X∗. Finally, since Y∗ is just a noisy version of F∗, the mean and covariance of (48) is just computed as: E(Y∗) = E(F∗) and Cov(Y∗) = Cov(F∗) + β−1IN∗ .\nC.2 Predictions given the test time points and partially observed outputs The expression for the predictive density p(Y m∗ |Y p ∗ , Y ) follows exactly as in section C.1 but we need to compute probabilities for Y m∗ instead of Y∗ and Y is replaced with (Y, Y p ∗ ) in all conditioning sets. Similarly, F is replaced with Fm. Now q(X∗) cannot be found analytically as in section C.1; instead, it is optimised so that Y p∗ are taken into account. This is done by maximising the variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood:\np(Y p∗ , Y ) = ∫ p(Y p∗ , Y |X∗, X)p(X∗, X)dX∗dX\n= ∫ p(Y m|X)p(Y p∗ , Y p|X∗, X)p(X∗, X)dX∗dX,\nNotice that here, unlike the main paper, we work with the likelihood after marginalising F , for simplicity. Assuming a variational distribution q(X∗, X) and using Jensen’s inequality we obtain the lower bound∫\nq(X∗, X) log p(Y m|X)p(Y p∗ , Y p|X∗, X)p(X∗, X)\nq(X∗, X) dX∗dX\n= ∫ q(X) log p(Y m|X)dX + ∫ q(X∗, X) log p(Y p ∗ , Y p|X∗, X)dX∗dX\n− KL[q(X∗, X)||p(X∗, X)] (51)\nThis quantity can now be maximized in the same manner as for the bound of the training phase. Unfortunately, this means that the variational parameters that are already optimised from the training procedure cannot be used here because X and X∗ are coupled in q(X∗, X). A much faster but less accurate method would be to decouple the test from the training latent variables by imposing the factorisation q(X∗, X) = q(X)q(X∗). Then, equation (51) would break into terms containing X , X∗ or both. The ones containing only X could then be treated as constants.\nD Additional results from the experiments"

Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences.",
