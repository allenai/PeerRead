      "text" : "Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to a time series can be used for time series classification. Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-theart shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible.\nA method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for the shapelet-based classifiers. It is shown that they have a positive impact and that they are easy to integrate with a simple preprocessing step, without the need of adapting the shapelet discovery algorithm.\nKeywords: Data mining, Mining methods and algorithms, Time Series Classification, Scalability, Time Series Shapelets"

      "text" : "Time series classification is a field of significant interest for researchers because time series occur in various domains such as finance, multimedia, medicine and more. A time series is a sequence of data points that have a temporal relation between each other. For time series classification it is common to identify motifs or local patterns that have discrimination quality towards the target variable. One popular method is to identify shapelets [1]. Shapelets are discriminative subsequences and have the property that the distance between a shapelet and its best matching subsequence of a time series is a good\n∗Corresponding author Email addresses: wistuba@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de (Martin Wistuba),\njosif@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de (Josif Grabocka), schmidt-thieme@ismll.uni-hildesheim.de (Lars Schmidt-Thieme)\nPreprint submitted to Journal of Data & Knowledge Engineering January 24, 2015\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n05 01\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n7 M\nar 2\n01 5\nECGFiveDays\npredictor for time series classification. Many methods try to find shapelets and apply Shapelet Transformation [2]. Shapelet Transformation is the data transformation method that is used to convert the raw time series data using the shapelets to a different data representation that contains features that correspond to a specific shapelet and its value is the minimal distance to the time series (see Section 4.2.1). The idea of shapelets was mainly applied for univariate time series classification but also for time series clustering [3] and early classification of multivariate time series [4].\nOne of the biggest problems of shapelet discovery is that it is very time-consuming. Hence, there are various methods of pruning the candidate space [5], improving the scoring function that defines how good a shapelet is [6, 1] or by parallelization [7]. Nevertheless, discovering shapelets remains a slow procedure and is infeasible for large datasets.\nWe want to tackle the problem of slow shapelet discovery by introducing an unsupervised method that does not need to compute the prediction accuracy of each single candidate. Instead a pool of unsupervised, sampled shapelets is computed and a model is learned in the end. The idea is to exploit the fact that discriminative motifs are appearing frequently. This improves the shapelet discovery process and still a good accuracy can be achieved. This effect is shown in Figure 1.\nThe contributions are four-fold:\n1. An ultra-fast way of extracting time series subsequences is proposed that allows faster feature extraction than any method that tries to identify discriminative subsequences in a supervised way but is still comparable in terms of classification accuracy.\n2. We propose a method which allows time series classification on multivariate time series that concatenates features extracted on different streams. This idea is evaluated on 15 datasets from various domains and compared to state-of-the-art methods for multivariate time series classification.\n3. Time series derivatives are considered as additional features for shapelet-based classifiers. Its easy integration with a simple preprocessing step is demonstrated\nas well as the positive impact on the classification accuracy for shapelet-based classifiers.\n4. A comparison between different shapelet-based methods using the original authors’ implementation is conducted. Additionally, the sensitivity for the hyperparameter that defines the number of shapelets that are extracted is analyzed.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section related work is presented and delimited from our contributions. In Section 4, the notation and problem as well as a brief background description is provided. Also, our idea of shapelet discovery is presented and motivated and finally extended to multivariate time series classification. The section ends with a discussion about time series derivatives. Afterwards, in Section 5, it is presented that our idea of shapelet discovery is faster than the state-of-the-art but nevertheless as accurate for univariate time series. Finally, on 15 multivariate time series datasets it is empirically proven that our method provides better predictors for classification. The work is concluded in Section 6."

      "text" : "The concept of shapelets, discriminative subsequences, was first introduced by Ye et al. [1]. The idea is to consider all subsequences of the training data and assess them regarding a scoring function to estimate how predictive they are with respect to the target. The first proposed scoring function was information gain. Also other measures like F-Stat, Kruskall-Wallis and Mood’s median were considered [2, 8]. It is possible to use the extracted subsequences to transform the data and use an arbitrary classifier [2]. Instead of searching shapelets exhaustively, Grabocka et al. [9] try to learn optimal shapelets with respect to the target and report statistically significant improvements in accuracy compared to other shapelet-based classifiers.\nShapelets have been used in many applications such as medicine [4], gesture [10] and gait recognition [11] and even time series clustering [3].\nSince a time series dataset usually contains many shapelet candidates, a brute-force search is very time-consuming and hence many speed-up techniques exist. On the one hand, there are smart implementations using early abandon of distance computation and entropy pruning for the information gain heuristic [1]. On the other hand, ideas to trade time for speed and reuse computations and to prune the search space [6] as well as pruning candidates by searching possibly interesting candidates on the SAX representation [5] or using infrequent shapelets [12] are applied. Gordon et al. [13] learn a decision tree using random subsequences. For each split they consider random subsequences and compute the information gain. If for some time no better subsequence was chosen, the subsequence is used for the split.\nIn comparison to the related work, discriminative subsequences are not assessed using a scoring function. Instead of that, subsequences are chosen at random and subsequences that provide discriminative features are identified during the learning process of a classifier. This leads to a faster feature extraction process without much impact on the classification accuracy. Our method is also not restricted to a specific classifier.\nShapelets are already considered for the multivariate time series classification by Ghalwash et al. [4]. However, they use multivariate instead of univariate shapelets and use them for early classification. We follow a different idea by using univariate shapelets\nthat are specific for a stream and by considering their interaction among each other using the classifier. Hence, interaction between streams are learned and not assumed.\nA very common method for multivariate time series classification is to apply dimensionality reduction like singular value decomposition on the data and then use any classifier on this data. This overcomes the problem of time series with varying lengths [14, 15]. Other methods try to use similiarity-based methods that have proven to be useful for univariate time series classification. For example dynamic time warping was applied on multivariate time series in the context of accelerometer-based gesture recognition [16, 17].\nBaydogan et al. [18] use a symbolic representation for multivariate time series. This is similar to SAX [19] but in contrast, the symbols are not fixed but learned in a supervised way using random forests."

As discussed in Section 4.2, this is equivalent to variable ranking. The scoring function s is usually the information gain but also other quality measures like Kruskal-Wallis, F-statistic and Mood’s median were already considered.\nAs considering all candidates is infeasible for bigger datasets, the candidates are reduced by considering only subsequences of specific lenghts by choosing a minimum and a maximum length, sometimes a stepsize greater than one. Obviously, as the length of the best subsequence length is unknown, this are very sensitive hyperparameters. A further hyperparamater is the number of shapelets that will be chosen. This is also an important hyperparameter as setting it too low might lead to not considering important features and setting it too high adds to much noise for simple classifiers like Nearest Neighbor."

Hence, an approximative method, so called Fast Shapelets (FS) [5], was introduced. The idea is reduce the dimension of the data by estimating the SAX representation [19] and searching on the reduced space for features that are likely to be useful. Hence, mapping back from the reduced space to the original space only few candidates are left. The final features are estimated applying variable ranking. Fast Shapelets is the fastest published method for shapelet discovery we are aware of that yields comparable classification accuracy.\nLike in the exhaustive search, there exist the hyperparameters to prune the search space by subsequence length. However, it is also possible to simply take all of them.\nThree new hyperparameters for the dimensionality reduction are needed, i.e. window length, alphabet size and word length, which might be less sensitive."

[9] propose to consider the shapelets to be parameters that are optimized regarding the loss as well. Hence, shapelets are not found using an approximative measure for being useful for a model but directly optimized for it. This means, it has an advantage because the method does not consider a limited set of candidates but can choose arbitrary shapelets. Disadvantages of this method are that its accuracy highly depends on the initial shapelets and not every classification model can be used. The number of hyperparameters is the same as the exhaustive search but it will be shown that the running time can be slower. In the following sections, this method is called Learning Shapelets (LS)."

      "text" : "The last section has shown how to apply Shapelet Transformation on univariate time series. Now, the relation between shapelet discovery and feature subset selection will be discussed. Therefor, the definition that is used for a shapelet is recited here.\nDefinition 1. Given is a univariate time series dataset T and a scoring function s that ranks a subsequence of a time series T according to T . Then, a shapelet S is defined as a subsequence of a time series T ∈ T which is among the p highest ranked subsequences regarding to the scoring function s.\nIn the literature this kind of feature subset selection is called variable ranking and is a filter method [20]. Filter methods have the advantage of being computational fast and\nscalable but have the disadvantages of choosing redundant features and ignore dependencies among features and to the classifier. However, even though variable ranking is one of the fastest feature selection methods, it is still slow for shapelet discovery since the O ( nm2 ) features, where n is the number of time series instances and m is the length of a time series, are not given beforehand. First, the minimal distance (Equation 2) needs to be computed before the quality can be assessed."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.3. Shapelet Discovery as Feature Sampling",
      "text" : "Here, a new way of shapelet discovery is proposed. Instead of considering all candidates and applying subsequence transformation and variable ranking (Shapelet Transformation, see Figure 2), the predictors are chosen at random. This idea is sketched in Figure 5. Comparing Figures 2 and Figure 5, one can see that the difference is twofold. For the candidate extraction step a random subset of candidates is chosen and steps 2 and 3 of the Shapelet Transformation, i.e. the feature subset selection, are omitted. From now on, this way of selecting subsequences will be called Ultra-Fast Shapelets.\nThe GunPoint dataset will be used to motivate the idea of Ultra-Fast Shapelets. The GunPoint dataset is an activity recognition dataset where the task is to distinguish whether a human being is lifting his arm to point at something or whether he is drawing a weapon. Example instances of this dataset are shown in Figure 4. This figure also shows the shapelets found using the variable ranking method which are considered to be useful for classification [2]. First, the question is whether similar good subsequences can be found if randomly subsequences of arbitrary length are considered and second, if useless subsequences are a problem. Lets stick to the GunPoint dataset and assume that there are only the two clusters of shapelets shown in Figure 4. Obviously, it is enough to find just one representative for each shapelet cluster since they are redundant and do not give further information. Since they are typical for the data, it is assumed that one out of the two shapelets is found in each time series. The GunPoint dataset contains\n50 training instances and hence approximately 50 shapelets. For this dataset 1% of the subsequences are chosen at random. Hence, the probability for finding a representative for both shapelets clusters is quite unlikely. Nevertheless, subsequences within the same interval as one of the shapelets which are a bit longer or shorter are obviously also very good predictors.\nIn the example, all shapelets are of length 40 but one can assume that subsequences of lengths between 35 and 45 in the same time interval have similar predictive quality. Thus, there are not 50 candidates but 1,230. If one agrees that this holds, the probability of selecting a subsequence which is very close to one of the shapelets discovered by variable ranking is very high. At this point, the reader may have already noticed that there are further discriminative parts that might have not been considered by the variable ranking. Since only the best p features are considered in the variable ranking method and since there are many similar and hence equally high ranked features, the effective number of features in the end can be very small. If p is not chosen high enough, discriminative parts like in the dashed, orange plots around time 50 and in the dotted, blue plots around time 110 (Figure 4) are not considered.\nFinally, it is more likely that Ultra-Fast Shapelets finds interacting features than variable ranking. Lets think about a dataset with two classes (Figure 6). The one class has either only noise or at least one ∨-shaped and one ∧-shaped subsequence which are interrupted by arbitrary long subsequences of noise. The other class either has only subsequences of type ∨ divided by subsequences of noise and none of type ∧ or vice versa. If features are extracted by variable ranking, the subsequences ∨ and ∧ will have a bad score since the accuracy of each of them alone is about 50% which is as good as random. Therefor, they will not be selected and no good classifier can be trained. On the other hand, Ultra-Fast Shapelets will choose some of them as discussed before and a perfect classifier can be trained.\nConcluding, time series contain many duplicates of subsequences where some of them are useful and some are not. This motivates the idea of randomly selecting subsequences. A well regularized classifier can then be used to identify useful subsequences and their interactions."

The proposition is to transform multivariate time series using shapelets in a similar way as described for the univariate case before. In the first step, shapelets are chosen at random from each of the s streams such that sets of shapelets S1, . . .Ss are extracted. Ignoring temporal relations between the streams, the raw data is transformed into a dataset D such that the features are generated on each stream as in the univariate case and then concatinated. Formally, using the sets Si of size ps , the dataset D = (X,Y ), X ∈ R n×p\nis computed where xi,j = minDist ( Sj−(dj spe−1) ps , Ti,dj spe ) and Sj−(dj spe−1) ps ∈ Sdj spe.\nAlgorithm 1 explains this process in detail. In line 2, the ratio f between the number of features p and the number of all subsequences of arbitrary length is computed. In lines 4-9, subsequences of different length are extracted uniformly at random. After extracting them, the subsequence-transformed dataset is estimated by computing the distance of a subsequence to each time series in lines 12-16. For the distance function in line 16 we have chosen one of the distance functions defined in Equations 1 and 2.\nFor the experiments on the multivariate datasets, a different distance function between a shapelet and a time series is considered because it provides better results for some datasets: the minimal Euclidean distance between a shapelet and the unnormalized time series\nminDist (S, T ) = min i=1,...,m−l+1  √√√√ l∑\nj=1\n(sj − ti+j)2  .

The leading 0 ensures that the derivative has the same length as its time series. The use of derivatives of time series is straight forward for Ultra-Fast Shapelets. For each stream Ti of a time series T a new stream ∇Ti is added which is the derivative of Ti. The original dataset is now twice that large but no adaption to Algorithm 1 needs to be done.

Detailed results for each dataset are shown in Table 2.\nThe different methods can be divided into two groups depending on which kind of classifier they use. The methods that are using a linear SVM (UFS (SVM), ES (SVM), LS) yield better results than those which are using a non-linear, tree-based classifier. The tree-based classifiers are only in 9 datasets better than the SVM which confirms the results by Hills et al. [2]. Overall, FS is the worst classifier which is not surprising because it is an approximation of ES. Comparing UFS with ES by classifier, the performance using a SVM is almost similar. ES has better prediction quality on 10 datasets, UFS on 15. UFS using a random forest shows better performance in 19 datasets and is worse than ES in 7. These results show a strong empirical evidence that simply choosing subsequences at random will not deteriorate the accuracy in comparison to more informative methods like ES or FS.\nWhile LS achieves better accuracy than UFS, it has a higher runtime performance by an average of three orders of magnitude and is the slowest among all investigated methods, as shown in the next section. In that context, the proposed method (UFS)\nis more scalable than LS for large datasets. In terms of hyperparameters, LS requires three sensitive hyperparameters while our proposed method has only a single insensitive hyperparameter (see Section 5.3). This excludes the classifier-specific hyperparameters for both methods. Finally, one of the reasons that LS is more accurate is that it is not limited in the number of candidates. While ES, FS and UFS can only choose among subsequences that appear in the training set, LS can choose any subsequence."

      "heading" : "5.2.2. Runtime Analysis",
      "text" : "This section shows that Ultra-Fast Shapelets (UFS) is not only as accurate as stateof-the-art methods but also significantly faster which makes it finally feasible to apply shapelets on multivariate time series datasets. Therefor, the four shapelet-based methods are compared empirically and theoretically.\nStarting with the empirical runtime analysis, Table 4 provides the measured runtime in seconds averaged over 10 replications for each method on 52 datasets. The subsequence lengths that are considered are those proposed by the authors. This means that only UFS and Fast Shapelets (FS) are considering all candidates while the exhaustive search (ES) and Learning Shapelets (LS) only consider a subset of them. Knowing this, note that this is obviously an advantage for ES and LS. Nevertheless, FS and UFS are significantly faster. UFS is slow compared to the baselines for the small datasets but in general faster which means that it is faster than the fastest shapelet discovery method so far (FS) in 45 out of 52 datasets, in some even by a factor of 100.\nThe number of all subsequences respectively candidates in a time series dataset with n instances of length m is c = O ( nm2 ) . Since the exhaustive search compares each possible\npair of candidates of equal length, the runtime is O ( n2m4 ) . FS reduces the number of\ncandidates to a subset r < c which is then compared with all O ( nm2 ) candidates of equal\nlength so that FS needs time O ( rnm2 ) . LS [9] reports a runtime of O ( ipnm2 ) where i is the number of iterations used until the algorithm converges and p is the number of shapelets that have to be found. Since the authors propose a very high number of iterations and shapelets for some datasets, a comparably high runtime is observed. Finally, UFS chooses randomly a subset of p candidates, where for the here executed experiments p < 10, 000. Thus, the runtime is O ( pnm2 ) and p < r for the larger datasets but p ≈ nm2 for the very small datasets which explains the high runtime for those. Since the number of candidates p is not optimized but a rule of thumb was used, one can further improve the speed without a loss of accuracy as shown in Section 5.3. Theoretical and empirical results are summarized in Table 3."

This section is devoted to two questions: i) is Ultra-Fast Shapelets sensitive to the hyperparameter and is it easy to find an optimal one and ii) is Ultra-Fast Shapelets better because it uses more features respectively does it help the baselines if they also use more features. These two question will be answered exemplarily at four random datasets. Figure 8 shows the accuracy and the time needed for Ultra-Fast Shapelets (UFS) and the exhaustive search (ES) using a linear SVM.

Actually, with increasing number of shapelets, the accuracy improves until it converges at some point which makes it easy to find the best number of shapelets for both methods. ES profits from the supervised features selection and tends to need less features to achieve its best accuracy. The random subsequence selection of UFS tends to result in the need of more features but needs orders of magnitudes less time to find them. Finally, if the results for UFS in Figure 8 are compared to the reported results in\nTable 2 and 4 it is clear that a hyperparameter search will further improve the runtime without harming the accuracy."

Time series derivatives were added since Symbolic Representation for Multivariate Timeseries (SMTS) are using them by default. For SMTS it was shown that this additional information improves the accuracy. Time series derivatives can improve the accuracy for UFS in some cases. In some they do not help, in some they may deteriorate the accuracy since they are adding less helpful predictors. Nevertheless, UFS with derivatives is in 11 out of 15 cases better than without derivatives.\nUFS with and without derivatives outperforms the baselines. ∇UFS is for 11, UFS for 10 out of 15 datasets better than SMTS. For NNDTW the number of cases is even 14 or 13, respectively. Comparing UFS to MTSBF, UFS is better in 5 or 6 out of 7 datasets, depending whether time series derivatives are used or not.\nConcluding, UFS with derivatives is more accurate than without. UFS is better than SMTS even if no time series derivatives are used and MTSBF has a similar prediction accuracy as SMTS. NNDTW is the worst of the compared classification methods."

      "text" : "We proposed an ultra-fast way of extracting shapelets motivated by the knowledge of redundant subsequences. Because the shapelet discovery by most authors so far is nothing but a feature subset selection which is costly in time, it was not surprising that our method, Ultra-Fast Shapelets, reduces the runtime by order of magnitudes and is, to the best of our knowledge, the fastest so far published shapelet discovery method.\nFurthermore, the ultra-fast shapelet discovery method enabled us to apply shapeletbased classifiers on long univariate datasets as well as on multivariate time series. We compared UFS on 52 univariate datasets with current state-of-the-art shapelet-based methods and showed empirically that it is competitive in terms of accuracy. Additionally, a comparison to state-of-the-art methods for multivariate time series classification on 15 datasets from various domains has shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets creates predictive features. A Random Forest classifier was better with shapelet features in 11 out of 15 cases compared to SMTS features."

    "abstractText" : "Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to a time series can be used for time series classification. Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-theart shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible. A method for using shapelets for multivariate time series is proposed and Ultra-Fast Shapelets is proven to be successful in comparison to state-of-the-art multivariate time series classifiers on 15 multivariate time series datasets from various domains. Finally, time series derivatives that have proven to be useful for other time series classifiers are investigated for the shapelet-based classifiers. It is shown that they have a positive impact and that they are easy to integrate with a simple preprocessing step, without the need of adapting the shapelet discovery algorithm.",
