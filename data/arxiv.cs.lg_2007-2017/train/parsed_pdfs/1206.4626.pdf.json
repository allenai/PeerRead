Contrarily, Kelly investment (Kelly, 1956; Breiman, 1961; Finkelstein & Whitley, 1981), which maximizes the expected log return of a portfolio, aims for multiple periods portfolio selection. Due to the sequential nature, recent on-line portfolio selection techniques often design algorithms following the second approach.\nOne important property exploited by many existing studies (Borodin et al., 2004; Li et al., 2011b; 2012) is the mean reversion property, which assumes poor performing stocks will perform well in the subsequent periods and vice versa, may better fit the financial markets. Though some recent mean reversion algorithms (Li et al., 2011b; 2012) achieve the best results on many datasets, they perform extremely poor on certain datasets, such as DJA dataset (Borodin et al., 2004). Comparing with Borodin et al. (2004), which exploits multi-period correlation, we found that the assumption of single-period prediction may attribute to the performance degradation. On the other hand, as illustrated in existing studies (Li et al., 2011b; 2012), Borodin et al. (2004), which heuristically exploits mean reversion via correlation, cannot fully exploit the potential of (multi-period) mean reversion.\nTo address the above drawbacks, we present a new approach for on-line portfolio selection, named “On-Line Moving Average Reversion” (OLMAR). The basic idea is to represent multi-period mean reversion as “Moving Average Reversion” (MAR), which explicitly predicts next price relatives using moving averages, and then learn portfolios by online learning techniques. To the best of our knowledge, OLMAR is the first algorithm that exploits moving average in the setting of on-line portfolio selection. Though simple in nature, OLMAR has a reasonable update and is empirically validated via extensive experiments on real markets. The experiments show that OLMAR can achieve better performance (in terms of cumulative wealth) than existing algorithms, and more importantly, can avoid the performance degradation in certain datasets, such as DJA dataset (Borodin et al., 2004; Li et al., 2012). Finally,\nOLMAR runs much faster than the state of the art, and thus is suitable for large-scale applications.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates the on-line portfolio selection problem, and Section 3 reviews and analyzes related work. Section 4 presents the proposed OLMAR approach, and its effectiveness is validated by extensive empirical studies on real stock markets in Section 5. Section 6 summarizes the paper and provides directions for future work."

      "heading" : "2. Problem Setting",
      "text" : "Consider an investment task over a financial market with m assets for n periods. On the tth period, the assets’ prices are represented by a close price vector pt ∈ Rm+ , and each element pt,i represents the close price of asset i. Their price changes are represented by a price relative vector xt ∈ Rm+ , and xt,i =\npt,i pt−1,i . Thus, an investment in asset i on the\ntth period increases by a factor of xt,i. Let us denote xn = {x1, . . . ,xn} as the sequence of price relative vectors for n periods.\nAn investment on the tth period is specified by a portfolio vector bt = (bt,1, . . . , bt,m), where bt,i represents the proportion of wealth invested in asset i. Typically, we assume the portfolio is self-financed and no margin/short is allowed, therefore each entry of a portfolio is non-negative and adds up to one, that is, bt ∈ ∆m, where ∆m = { bt : bt ∈ Rm+ , ∑m i=1 bt,i = 1 } . The investment procedure is represented by a portfolio strategy, that is, b1 = 1 m1 and following sequence of mappings bt : Rm(t−1)+ → ∆m, t = 2, 3, . . ., where bt = bt ( xt−1 ) is the tth portfolio given past market sequence xt−1 = {x1, . . . ,xt−1}. We denote by bn = {b1, . . . ,bn} the strategy for n periods.\nOn the tth period, a portfolio bt produces a portfolio period return st, that is, the wealth increases by a factor of st = b ⊤ t xt = ∑m i=1 bt,ixt,i. Since we reinvest and adopt price relative, the portfolio wealth would multiplicatively grow. Thus, after n periods, a portfolio strategy bn produces a portfolio cumulative wealth of Sn, which increases the initial wealth by a factor of ∏n t=1 b ⊤ t xt, that is, Sn (b n,xn) = S0 ∏n t=1 b ⊤ t xt, where S0 is set to $1 for convenience.\nFinally, let us formulate the on-line portfolio selection problem. In this task, a portfolio manager is a decision maker, whose goal is to produce a portfolio strategy bn, aiming to maximize the cumulative wealth Sn. He/she computes the portfolios sequentially. On each period t, the manager has access to the sequence of previous price relative vectors xt−1. Then, he/she computes a new portfolio bt for next price relative\nvector xt, where the decision criterion varies among different managers. The portfolio bt is scored based on portfolio period return st. This procedure is repeated until the end, and the portfolio strategy is finally scored according to portfolio cumulative wealth Sn.\nNote that the above model in general assumes zero transaction cost/tax, perfect market liquidity, and zero impact cost. These assumptions are not trivial, and their effects and implications will be further analyzed and discussed in Section 5.3 and Section 5.5."

One classical strategy is Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (CRP), which follows Kelly’s idea of keeping a fixed fraction for each asset on all periods. The best possible CRP strategy in hindsight is often known as Best Constant Rebalanced Portfolios (BCRP), which is the optimal strategy if the market is i.i.d. (Cover & Thomas, 1991, Theorem 15.3.1). Cover (1991) initialized the research of on-line portfolio selection (Ordentlich & Cover, 1996) and proposed Universal Portfolios (UP) strategy, whose portfolio is historical performance weighted average of all CRPs.\nHelmbold et al.

      "text" : "Most existing formulations follow the basic routine of Kelly-based portfolio selection (Thorp, 1971). In particular, a portfolio manager first predicts x̃t+1 in terms of k possible values x̃1t+1, . . . , x̃ k t+1 and their corresponding probabilities p1, . . . , pk. Note that each x̃ i t+1 denotes one possible combination vector of individual price relative prediction. Then he/she can figure out portfolio by maximizing the expected log return,\nbt+1 = argmax b∈∆m k∑ i=1 pi log ( b · x̃it+1 ) .\nBased on methods of predicting x̃it+1 and pi, most existing algorithms can be classified into three categories. Their optimization formulations and underlying predictions are summarized in Table 1, and their details can be found on their respective studies. Note that we have transformed certain formulations, however, maintained their key ideas.\nNow let us focus on the first category, which consists of EG, PAMR and CWMR. Algorithms in this category assume a single prediction value with a probability of 100%, and maintains previous portfolio information via regularization techniques. In particular, EG assumes x̃1t+1 = xt with p1 = 100%, while PAMR and CWMR assume x̃1t+1 = 1 xt\nwith p1 = 100%, which is in essence mean reversion idea. Note that the formulations of PAMR and CWMR ignore the log utility due to the single-value prediction and the consideration of con-\nvexity and computation issue. Though all three algorithms assume that all information is fully reflected by xt, their performance diverges and supports that mean reversion fits the markets. On the one hand, even with a decent theoretical result, EG always performs far behind. On the other hand, though without theoretical guarantees, PAMR and CWMR always produce the best results in various real markets. However, PAMR and CWMR suffer from dramatic failures when such single-period mean reversion is not satisfied (Li et al., 2012), which motivates our approach."

      "text" : "Empirical results (Li et al., 2011b; 2012) show that mean reversion, which assumes the poor stock may perform good in the subsequent periods, may better fit the markets. PAMR and CWMR can exploit the mean reversion property well and achieve good results on most datasets at the time, especially the NYSE benchmark dataset (Cover, 1991). However, they rely on a simple assumption that the predicted next price relative x̃t+1 will be inverse proportion to last price relative xt. In particular, they implicitly assume that next price p̃t+1 will revert to last price pt−1, as follows,\nx̃t+1 = 1 xt =⇒ p̃t+1 pt = pt−1 pt =⇒ p̃t+1 = pt−1.\nNote that x and p are all vectors and the above operations are element-wise.\nThough empirically effective on most datasets, PAMR and CWMR’s single-period assumption causes two potential problems. Firstly, both algorithms suffer from the frequently fluctuating raw prices, as they often contain a lot of noises. Second, their assumption of single-period mean reversion may not be satisfied in the real world. Even two consecutive declining price relatives, which are common, can fail both algorithms. One real example (Li et al., 2012) is DJA dataset (Borodin et al., 2004), on which PAMR performs the worst among the state of the art. Thus,\ntraders are more likely to predict prices using the longterm mean. Also on the DJA dataset, Anticor, which exploits the multi-period statistical correlation, performs much better. However, as illustrated in Li et al. (2011b; 2012), due to its heuristical nature, Anticor can not fully exploit mean reversion. The two problems caused by single-period assumption and Anticor’s inability to fully exploit mean reversion call for a more powerful approach to effectively exploit mean reversion, especially in terms of multi-period.\nNow let us see the classic example (Cover & Gluss, 1986; Li et al., 2012) to illustrate the drawbacks of single-period mean reversion, as shown in Table 2. The toy market consists of cash and one volatile stock, whose market sequence follows A. It is easy to prove that BCRP (b = ( 1 2 , 1 2 ) ) can grow by a fac-\ntor of ( 9 8 )n/2 , while PAMR/CWMR can grow by a better factor of 32 × 2 (n−1)/2. Note that this virtual sequence is essentially singe-period mean reversion, which perfectly fits with PAMR and CWMR’s assumption. However, if market sequence does not satisfy this assumption, both PAMR and CWMR would fail badly. Let us extend the market sequence to a two-period reversion, that is, market sequence B. In such a market, BCRP can achieve the same growth as before. Contrarily, PAMR/CWMR can achieve a constant wealth 3 2 , which has no growth! More generally, if we further extend to k-period mean reversion, BCRP can still achieve the same growth, while PAMR/CWMR\nwill grow to 32× ( 1 2 )(n−1)×( 12− 1k ), which definitely approaches bankruptcy when k ≥ 3.\nTo better exploit the (multi-period) mean reversion property, we proposed a new type of algorithms, named On-Line Moving Average Reversion (OLMAR), for on-line portfolio selection. The essential idea is to exploit multi-period moving average (mean) reversion via power online machine learning. Rather than p̃t+1 = pt−1, OLMAR assumes that next price will revert to Moving Average (MA) at the end of tth period, that is, p̃t+1 = MAt (w) = 1 w ∑i=t i=t−w+1 pi, where MAt (w) denotes the Moving Average (MA) with a w-window. In time series analysis, MA is typi-\ncally used to smooth short-term price fluctuations and focus on long-term trends, thus can solve the two drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms. To this end, we propose a price relative vector following the idea of “Moving Average Reversion” (MAR),\nx̃t+1 (w) = MAt (w)\npt =\n1 w ( pt pt + pt−1 pt + · · ·+ pt−w+1 pt ) = 1\nw\n( 1 + 1\nxt + · · ·+ 1⊗w−2\ni=0 xt−i\n) ,\n(1) where w is the window size and ⊗ denotes elementwise production. Without detailing the calculation, we list the growth of OLMAR in different toy markets in Table 2. Clearly, OLMAR performs much better in the scenarios of multi-period mean reversion, while performs poor in single-period reversion. Our further empirical analysis shows that the markets are more likely to follow multi-period reversion.\nBased on the expected price relative vector in Eq. (1), OLMAR further adopts the idea of an effective online learning algorithm, that is, Passive Aggressive (PA) (Crammer et al., 2006) learning, to exploit moving average reversion. Generally proposed for classification, PA passively keeps the previous solution if the classification is correct, while aggressively approaches a new solution if the classification is incorrect. After formulating the proposed OLMAR optimization, we solve its closed form update and design the proposed algorithm."

On the one hand, if the constraint is satisfied, that is, the expected return is higher than a threshold, then the resulting portfolio equals to the previous portfolio. On the other hand, if the constraint is not satisfied, then the formulation will figure out a new portfolio such that the expected return is higher than the threshold, while the new portfolio is not far from the last one.\nSince OLMAR follows the same learning principle as PAMR, their formulations are similar. However, the two solutions are essentially different. In particular, PAMR’s core constraint, i.e., b · xt ≤ ϵ, adopts the raw price relative and has a different inequality sign."

The on-line portfolio selection following the problem setting in Section 2 is illustrated in Algorithm 1, and the proposed OLMAR procedure is illustrated in Algorithm 2.\nEmpirical observations of the parameter sensitivity in Section 5.2 show that the final performance is sensitive to the parameter w. To smooth the final performance of the system, we propose to adopt the Buy and Hold (BAH) version (Borodin et al., 2004; Györfi et al., 2006; Li et al., 2012), that is, for each period, we treat the individual OLMAR with a specified w ≥ 3 as an expert and combine multiple experts’ portfolios weighted by their historical performance.

For the assets in the group with higher predictions than average, OLMAR increases their proportions; for the others, OLMAR decreases their proportions. The transferred proportions are related to the surprise of\nthe predictions over their average and the positive Lagrangian multiplier, λ. This is consistent with normal portfolio selection procedure, that is, to transfer the wealth to the assets with better prospect to grow.\nClearly, the OLMAR update costs linear time per period w.r.t. m, and the normalization step can also be implemented in linear time (Duchi et al., 2008). To the best of our knowledge, OLMAR’s linear time is no worse than any existing algorithm."

One possible issue is “survivorship bias”. Since following existing works, the composition stocks never delisted from markets and survived for a long time, especially the two NYSE datasets. Another possible issue is “dataset selection”.

Empirical evidence show that stock’s high and low prices are temporary and stock price relatives are likely to follow the mean reversion phenomenon. While the existing mean reversion strategies are shown to achieve good empirical performance on many real datasets, they often make the single-period mean reversion assumption, which is not always satisfied, leading to poor performance in some real datasets. To overcome the limitation, this article proposes a multiple-period mean reversion, or so-called “Moving Average Reversion” (MAR), and a new on-line portfolio selection strategy named “On-Line Moving Average Reversion” (OLMAR), which exploits MAR by applying powerful online learning techniques. From our empirical results, we found that OLMAR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results, especially on the datasets where existing mean reversion algorithms failed. In addition to superior performance, OLMAR also runs extremely fast, further supporting its practical applicability to a wide range of applications.",
