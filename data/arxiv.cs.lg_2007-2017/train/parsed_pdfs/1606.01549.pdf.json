      "text" : "A recent trend to measure progress towards machine reading is to test a system’s ability of answering questions over the text it has to comprehend. Towards this end, several large-scale datasets of clozestyle questions over a context document have been introduced recently which allow the training of supervised machine learning systems (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015). The relatively unambiguous nature of answers to cloze-questions provides an objective benchmark to measure a system’s performance at text comprehension.\n∗BD and HL contributed equally to this work.\nDeep learning methods have been recently shown to outperform traditional shallow approaches for this task (Hermann et al., 2015). Their performance is further boosted by attention mechanisms borrowed from the machine translation literature (Bahdanau et al., 2014). This is not surprising, as answering a cloze-style query requires one to only attend to parts of the document relevant to the query. Current attention models aim to mimic this by weighting representations of document sub-units (such as words or sentences) by a score which determines their relevance to the query (Hermann et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2015; Kadlec et al., 2016).\nAn alternative way to selectively “attend” to different parts of the document while reading it is by gating the input to the reader with the query representation. This can be intuitively viewed as masking unimportant features of the input (for the task at hand) and emphasizing the important ones. Specifically, we compute an element-wise product between the query embedding and document representations at the intermediate layers of a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) reader. Our method was inspired by the observation that the GRU itself provides an attention mechanism through the use of its reset and forget gates; the element-wise product simply helps it focus on the query. We call this model the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader. The effectiveness of the proposed gated-attention mechanism is verified by the consistent improvement of the GA reader over various existing models on four different benchmark datasets.\nBesides achieving strong performance, we believe an equally important metric is being able to interpret\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 54\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nJ un\n2 01\nsuch performance. We thus quantitatively investigate the performance of several representative models over a subset of questions with annotated linguistic features. This detailed analysis further justifies the advantages of the GA Reader by showing its superior performance in handling questions of diverse linguistic nature.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We introduce existing models (and their relationship to our model) in Section 2 and then the GA Reader in Section 3. Section 4 presents results of empirical evaluations, followed by a detailed analysis in Section 5. We summarize our findings in Section 6."

      "text" : "The cloze-style QA task involves tuples of the form (d, q, a), where d is a document, q is a cloze-style question over the contents of that document and a is the answer to this query. The answer comes from a fixed vocabulary A, which, depending on the dataset, may consist of all words in the vocabulary or a list of candidates from the current document. The task can then be described as: given a documentquery pair (d, q) find a ∈ A which answers q.\nIn the following we provide an overview of existing neural architectures which have been applied to this problem with encouraging results."

      "heading" : "2.1 LSTMs with Attention",
      "text" : "Several architectures introduced in (Hermann et al., 2015) employ LSTM units to compute a combined document + query representation g(d, q). Given this representation and a lookup-table of embeddings of possible answers W (which is shared with the lookup-table used by the LSTM), the probability of an answer is computed as:\np(a|q) ∝ exp(W (a)g(d, q)), a ∈ V. (1)\nThe motivation behind (1) is that g(d, q) should only contain information relevant to the task at hand—that of getting the answer a and should be close in the vector-space to the correct answer, hence maximizing the inner product between these representations. Training can be performed using standard SGD over a loss-function such as cross-entropy between true answer and its predicted probability.\nWith this formulation, there are three related architectures proposed in (Hermann et al., 2015). The\nDeepLSTM Reader performs a single forward pass through the concatenated (document,query) pair to compute g(d, q). It further has two possible modes: cqa where the document is placed before the query, and qca where the query is placed before the document. The Attentive Reader computes a document vector r and query vector q separately and then combines them through an additional feed-forward layer to give g(d, q). The document vector r is computed using a weighted average of the intermediate token representations learned by a bi-directional LSTM, where the weights are computed conditioned on the query vector q. This is the conventional attention mechanism which favors certain tokens over others based on the query. The Impatient Reader is similar to the Attentive reader, but computes the document vector r iteratively such that the weight distribution over tokens in each iteration is conditioned on a particular query token (or its representation from the corresponding bi-directional LSTM).\nThe Attentive and Impatient Readers give similar performance on the CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and both outperform the DeepLSTM Reader (cf. (Hermann et al., 2015)). In our model we also use recurrent neural networks to read the document and query, but use a different attention mechanism and restrict candidate answers to the tokens appearing in the document."

      "heading" : "2.2 Memory Networks",
      "text" : "The Memory Network architecture was proposed in (Weston et al., 2014) and applied to the datasets considered here in (Hill et al., 2015). In MemNets, each sentence s in the input document is encoded to a memory m. This encoding uses a simple averaging of the vectors assigned to a window within the sentence around candidate answers. In line with conventional attention, the relevance of a particular memory mi to the query is computed by taking its dot-product with the query vector q and passing it through a softmax layer to get a distribution over all memories. Let this be αi. The overall memory in this first pass, relevant to the query, is then mo1 = ∑ i αimi. This process is repeated for several iterations, and each time the input query is qk = qk−1 +mok−1, with q0 = q.\nThe intuition behind this computation is that multiple hops over the same set of memories allow the\nmodel to reason over them individually. In each hop, the model can select a relevant memory and add it to the input for the next hop. Indeed, experiments on a different dataset from (Weston et al., 2014) show the effectiveness of the model to reason over documents. Combined with a set of heuristics, such as intermediate supervision and model ensembling, this architecture outperforms all the models discussed in section 2.1.\nIn this work, we retain the key idea of using multiple layers in the reader to effectively allow reasoning over the document, but employ recurrent neural networks for encoding memories (in our case a document) and the query."

      "heading" : "2.3 Attention Sum Reader",
      "text" : "The AS reader, presented in (Kadlec et al., 2016), obtains the current state-of-the-art performance on the datasets under consideration here. This is a simplified version of the DeepLSTM Reader which uses a bi-directional GRU network (Cho et al., 2014) to encode the query and document each into vectors. Then, candidate answers which appear in the document are evaluated by extracting their contextual representations from the bi-GRU and taking a dotproduct with the query vector q. This gives a score for each possible answer, which is normalized by the softmax function. Finally, multiple mentions of the same candidate entity are combined by adding up their probabilities, and the token with the maximum aggregated probability is selected as the predicted answer. This aggregation scheme is known as the pointer sum attention.\nAn important consequence of summing multiple mentions of an answer is that this model favors entities which occur frequently in the input document. However, as discussed in (Hermann et al., 2015), correct answers often appear frequently in the document for the news datasets in consideration here, so this generally improves model accuracy. The authors also present results on an ensemble of models with the same architecture which does significantly better than any single model.\nThe AS reader is a special case of our model with only a single layer and without the gated-attention mechanism described in detail below. These additions make the GA reader more expressive, and are justified by its superior performance."

      "heading" : "2.4 Dynamic Entity Representations",
      "text" : "The Dynamic Entity Representation (DER) network was recently introduced by (Kobayashi et al., 2016). This model builds dynamic representations of the candidate answers (entities in their case) while reading the document, by using a max-pooling function to accumulate the information collected on an entity so far. The model is motivated by the anonymization of entities in the CNN and Daily Mail datasets, and shows improved performance over previous approaches on the CNN dataset. Results on the Daily Mail and CBT datasets are not presented.\nIn our model we do not accumulate information over candidate answers while reading. Instead, we dynamically gate their representations between layers to “mask” away less informative features in their representation and retain the important ones."

      "heading" : "3.1 Motivation",
      "text" : "Our method extends the Attention Sum (AS) Reader, and performs multiple hops over the input document similar to the Memory Networks architecture (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). We use the same pointer sum attention mechanism as the AS reader in the output layer to obtain a distribution over candidate answers. End-to-end memory networks have been shown to perform well on synthetic QA tasks which require reasoning over multiple input sentences, and a key reason for this is its multi-layered architecture which performs several passes over the context (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Based on these findings we also incorporate multiple layers in our model.\nOur key contribution, however, is in a gatedattention mechanism, where after the first layer, subsequent hops over the document are gated by the query representation using an element-wise combination at layer inputs (Figure 1). This is in contrast to conventional attention mechanisms which apply a weighted averaging of layer outputs with the weights determined by a dot-product between query and document, e.g., attention mechanisms in all architectures discussed in section 2.\nCompositional operators for merging vector space representations of text have been studied extensively in the literature without a clear consensus on the best one. Depending on the task at hand, in some\ncases addition seems to perform better (for example when composing phrase representations (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008)), in others multiplication does better (for example when modeling entity relations (Yang et al., 2014)). In our experiments, we explored both addition and multiplication as well as concatenation for the element-wise gating operation discussed above, and multiplication performed best. Previously, (Kiros et al., 2014) also used multiplicative interactions between text attributes (such as author information) and word embeddings to derive context-dependent text representations. For the GA reader, the query representation can also be viewed as an attribute conditioned on which we want to learn the relevant document representation."

The GA reader reads input documents and queries over K horizontal layers. At each layer, we combine the final forward and backward GRU hidden states to get the layer-specific query vector:\nqi = hf|Q|(i)||h b 0(i), i = 1, 2, ...K, (2)\nwhere || stands for concatenation, |Q| is the query length, and hft (i) and h b t(i) are forward and backward GRU hidden states at time t in layer i, respectively. GRUs which encode the query are shown in green in the figure.\nFor the document, input at the first Bi-GRU layer consists of word embeddings for the words in the document x1t = L(wt), where L ∈ R|V |×dL is the word-lookup table, and wt are indices into the word vocabulary. To compute the input to subsequent BiGRU layers, we use the Gated-Attention mechanism by applying an element-wise multiplication between the query embedding qi−1 and the outputs ei−1t from the previous layer:\nxit = q i−1 ei−1t , t = 1, 2, ...|d|. i = 2, ...K.\n(3) Here |d| is the document length and represents element-wise multiplication (a.k.a. Hadamard product). Layer outputs eit are the contextual embeddings of document tokens formed by concatenating intermediate forward and backward GRU hidden states:\neit = h f t (i)||hbt(i), t = 1, 2, ...|d|. i = 1, ...K.\n(4) GRUs encoding the document are shown in blue in Figure 1. To obtain the probability that a particular token in the document answers the query we take an inner-product between outputs of the last layer qK and eKt , and pass through a soft-max layer:\nst = exp{〈qK , eKt 〉}∑ t′ exp{〈qK , eKt′ 〉} , t = 1, 2, ...|d|, (5)\nwhere 〈, 〉 denotes dot-product between two vectors. Finally, similar to the AS reader, we aggregate the probabilities for tokens which appear multiple times\nin a document before selecting the maximum as the predicted answer (here I(a, d) is the set of positions where token a appears in the document d):\nP (a|d, q) = ∑\ni∈I(a,d)\nsi (6)\na∗ = argmaxa∈A P (a|d, q). (7)\nWe then use cross-entropy loss between the predicted probabilities and true answers for training. In the special case where K = 1, the above GA reader reduces to the Attention-Sum Reader."

A query over each article was formed by removing an entity from the short summary which follows the article. Further, entities within each article were anonymized to make the task purely a comprehension one. N-gram statistics, for instance, computed over the entire corpus are no longer useful in such an anonymized corpus.\nThe other two datasets are formed from two different subsets of the Children’s Book Test (CBT)2 (Hill et al., 2015). Documents consist of 20 contiguous sentences from the body of a popular children’s book, and the query is formed by deleting a token from the 21st sentence. We only focus on subsets where the deleted token is either a common noun (CN) or named entity (NE) since simple language models already give human-level performance on the other types (cf. (Hill et al., 2015)).\n1https://github.com/deepmind/rc-data 2http://www.thespermwhale.com/jaseweston/\nbabi/CBTest.tgz\nStatistics of the four datasets used in our experiments are summarized in Table 1."

The learning rate was set to 0.0005 and the batch size at each iteration to 32 for all models & datasets. We also used gradient clipping with a threshold of 10 to stabilize the GRU training (Pascanu et al., 2012). Word embeddings are of size 128 for all models & datasets, initialized with vectors obtained by running the word2vec toolkit5 on all documents and queries in the training set. We empirically found that this approach led to faster convergence. All other parameters were initialized to their default values as specified in the Lasagne library.\nThree parameters were tuned on the validation set for each dataset—the number of layersK, GRU hidden state sizes (both query and document) d, and the dropout rate p. We experimented with K = {2, 3}, d = {256, 384} and p = {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5}. Memory constraints prevented us from experimenting with higher K.

Meanwhile, combining together multiple GA readers gives the new state-of-the-art ensemble results on all four datasets. Improvement for the single models is greater for Daily Mail and CNN datasets as compared to the CBT datasets, for which the GA reader was prone to overfitting. The CBT datasets are considerably smaller than the other two, thus this is not surprising given the higher expressive power of GA reader. Improvement for the ensembles is significant for the CNN and CBT-NE datasets, but mild for Daily Mail and CBT-CN datasets."

For each question, features that may potentially correlate with the neural readers’ performance were extracted, as outlined in Table 4. In this paper, we primarily focus on two types of linguistic features:\n• Plain Features that are automatically annotated by scripts, such as document/query length, answer frequency, etc. Most of them are straightforward meta-information about the question.\n• Semantic Features that are manually annotated by a human expert. For example, whether logical reasoning is necessary to obtain the correct answer. Features of this type are arguably more\n6We plan to make the annotated questions publicly available if the manuscript is accepted for publication.\nprecise indicators about the intrinsic semantic nature of any given question.\nFigure 3 summarizes the corpus statistics regarding semantic features. Interestingly, the figure shows that the majority of the questions can be answered based on N-grams or paraphrases with less than two\nevidence sentences.

As we discussed above, breaking down overall accuracy into multiple conditional performances will enable us to get a more comprehensive view about the strength and weakness of different architectures.\nFour models are chosen for comparison: (1) the word distance benchmark (WD), a simple yet strong baseline relying on word distance measurements; (2) the Deep LSTM Reader, a representative LSTMbased neural architecture (Hermann et al., 2015); (3) the Attention Sum (AS) Reader, which achieves\nthe state-of-the-art performance over several text comprehension tasks (Kadlec et al., 2016); (4) GA reader, our proposed model.\nResults are reported in Figure 4, where the conditional performance of GA reader dominates other baselines except for temporal reasoning, showing a balanced strength in handling questions across the spectrum. While all models show weakness in reasoning with multiple facts (ES ≥ 3), we notice GA reader wins with a good margin in terms of combining two facts (ES = 2), suggesting its advantages in preliminary logical reasoning. The results also empirically justify the merits of attention sum, as both AS and GA readers significantly outperform WD and vanilla deep LSTM over all question types."

One can therefore quantitatively characterize the sensitivity of the neural readers’ performance w.r.t. different linguistic features by fitting a linear regression model where x and y are treated as explanatory and response variables, respectively 7. The resulting regression coefficients and p-values can effectively summarize which features are influential to the model performance.\n7Before regression, all features were normalized to the range of [0, 1] to make their scales comparable.\nFigure 5 shows the regression coefficients associated with different linguistic features in Table 4. Besides the known effect of DL and AF that have been discussed in the literature, we see the involvement of logical reasoning (LR), paraphrases (P) and multiple evidence sentences (ES) consistently lead to decreased performance for all models, though multilayered architectures (DeepLSTM, GA) are empirically more robust than single-layer (AS) or shallow (WD) ones in those aspects. Interestingly, Figure 5 also shows AFL is playing a crucial role. One possible explanation is that questions whose answers appear early tend to be relatively easier in nature. Meanwhile, it is not hard to verify that with high probability AFL will be negatively correlated with AF, a quantity known to have significance influence on the performance of most models."
