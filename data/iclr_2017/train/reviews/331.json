{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ``analogy making,'' or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The paper considers the problem of transferring skills between robots with different morphologies, in the context of agents that have to perform several tasks.

Learning state correspondences by using an alternating optimization to jointly assign the state pairs in P and learn the embedding functions f and g. This significantly relaxes the assumption that states can be paired by time-step and provides better performance in experiment 1. See section 3.3.2 for a description of this method and figures 5 and 7a for results.\n\n2.

The experiments are conducted in MuJoCo, with a set of experiments being from the state of the joints/links (5.2/5.3) and a set of experiments on the pixels (5.4). They exhibit transfer from arms with different number of links, and from a torque-driven arm to a tendon-driven arm.\n\nOne limitation of the paper is that the authors suppose that time alignment is trivial, because the tasks are all episodic and in the same domain. Time alignment is one form of domain adaptation / transfer that is not dealt with in the paper, that could be dealt with through subsampling, dynamic time warping, or learning a matching function (e.g. neural network).\n\nGeneral remarks: The approach is compared to CCA, which is a relevant baseline. However, as the paper is purely experimental, another baseline (worse than CCA) would be to just have the random projections for \"f\" and \"g\" (the embedding functions on the two domains), to check that the bad performance of the \"no transfer\" version of the model is due to over-specialisation of these embeddings. I would also add (for information) that the problem of learning invariant feature spaces is also linked to metric learning (e.g. [Xing et al. 2002]). More generally, no parallel is drawn with multi-task learning in ML. In the case of knowledge transfer (4.1.1), it may make sense to anneal \\alpha.\n\nThe experiments feel a bit rushed. In particular, the performance of the baseline being always 0 (no transfer at all) is uninformative, at least a much bigger sample budget should be tested. Also, why does Figure 7.b contain no \"CCA\" nor \"direct mapping\" results? Another concern that I have with the experiments: (if/how) did the author control for the fact that the embeddings were trained with more iterations in the case of doing transfer?\n\nOverall, the study of transfer is most welcomed in RL. The experiments in this paper are interesting enough for publication, but the paper could have been more thorough.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016 (modified: 20 Jan 2017)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Transfer learning in RL using a nonlinear CCA like approach ", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "\nThis paper explores transfer in reinforcement learning between agents that may be morphologically distinct. The key idea is for the source and target agent to have learned a shared skill, and then to use this to construct abstract feature spaces to enable the transfer of a new unshared skill in the source agent to the target agent. The paper is related to much other work on transfer that uses shared latent spaces, such as CCA and its variants, including manifold alignment and kernel CCA. \n\n\nThe paper reports on experiments using a simple physics simulator between robot arms consisting of three vs. four links. For comparison, a simple CCA based approach is shown, although it would have been preferable to see comparisons for something more current and up to date, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA. A three layer neural net is used to construct the latent feature spaces. \n\nThe problem of transfer in RL is extremely important, and receives less attention than it should. This work uses an interesting hypothesis of trying to construct transfer based on shared skills between source and target agent. This is a promising approach. However, the comparisons to related approaches is not very up to date, and the domains are fairly simplistic.
