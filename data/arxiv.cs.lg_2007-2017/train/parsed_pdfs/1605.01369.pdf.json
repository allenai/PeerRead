INTRODUCTION\nDeep Learning [1] has become a powerful machine learning model. It differs from traditional machine learning approaches in the following aspects: Firstly, Deep Learning contains multiple non-linear hidden layers and can learn very complicated relationships between inputs and outputs. Deep architectures using multiple layers outperform shadow models [2]. Secondly, there is no need to extract human design features [3], which can reduce the dependence of the quality of human extracted features. We mainly study three Deep Learning models in this work: Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN).\nDeep Neural Network (DNN) is the very basic deep learning model. It contains multiple layers with many hidden neurons with non-linear activation function in each layer. Figure 1 shows one simple example of Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. This Deep neural network has one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer. Training process of Deep Neural Network (DNN) includes forward propagation and back propagation. Forward propagation uses the current connection weight to give a prediction based on current state\nThis work was conducted while the first author was doing internship at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, WA, USA.\nof model. Back propagation computes the amount of weight should be changed based on the difference of ground truth label and forward propagation prediction. Back propagation in Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a non-convex problem. Different initialization affects classification accuracy and convergence speed of models.\nSeveral unsupervised pretraining methods for neural network have been proposed to improve the performance of random initialized DNN, such as using stacks of RBMs (Restricted Boltzmann Machines) [1], autoencoders [4], or DBM (Deep Boltzmann Machines) [5]. Compared to random initialization, pretraining followed with finetuning backpropagation will improve the performance significantly. Deep Belief Network (DBN) is a generative unsupervised pretraining network which uses stacked RBMs [6] during pretraining. A DNN with a corresponding configured DBN often produces much better results. DBN has undirected connections between its first two layers and directed connections between all its lower layers[7] [5].\nConvolution Neural Network (CNN) [8] [3] [9] has been proposed to deal with images, speech and time-series. This is because standard DNN has some limitations. Firstly, images, speeches are usually large. A simple Neural Network to process an image size of 100 × 100 with 1 layer of 100 hidden neurons will require 1,000,000 (100 × 100 × 100) weight parameters. With so many variables, it will lead to overfitting easily. Computation of standard DNN model requires expensive memory too. Secondly, standard DNN does not consider the local structure and topology of the input. For example, images have strong 2D local structure. Many areas in the image are similar. Speeches have a strong 1D structure, where variables temporally nearby are highly correlated. CNN forces the extraction of local features by restricting the receptive fields of hidden neurons to be local [9].\nHowever, the training process for deep learning algorithms, including DNN, DBN, CNN, is computationally expensive. This is due to the large number of training data and a large number of parameters for multiple layers. Inspired from the shrinking technique [10] [11] used in accelerating computation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm\nand screening [12] [13] technique used in LASSO, we propose an accelerating algorithm shrinking Deep Learning with Recall (sDLr). The main contribution of sDLr is that it can reduce the running time significantly. Though there is a trade-off between classification improvement and speedup on training time, for some data sets, sDLr approach can even improve classification accuracy. It should be noted that the approach sDLr is a general model and a new way of thinking, which can be applied to both large data, large network and small data small network, both sequential and parallel implementations. We will study the impact of proposed accelerating approaches on DNN, DBN and CNN using 4 data sets from computer vision and high energy physics, biology science."

      "text" : "The amount of data in our world has been exploding. Analyzing large data sets, so-called big data, will become a key basis of competition, underpinning new waves of productivity growth, innovation, and consumer interest [14]. A lot of big data technologies, including cloud computing, dimensionality reduction have been proposed [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Analyzing big data with machine learning algorithms requires special hardware implementations and large amount of running time.\nSVM [20] solves the following optimization problem:\nmin w,ξ,b\n1 2 wTw + C\nn∑\ni=1\nξi, (1)\nsubject to yi(wTΦ(xi)− b) > 1− ξi,\nξi > 0, i = 1, ..., n,\nwhere xi is a training sample, yi is the corresponding label, ξi is positive slack variable, Φ(xi) is mapping function, w gives the solution and is known as weight vector, C controls the relative importance of maximizing the margin\nand minimizing the amount of the slack. Since SVM learning problem has much less support vectors than training examples, shrinking [10] [11] was proposed to eliminate training samples for large learning tasks where the fraction of support vectors is small compared to the training sample size or when many support vectors are at the upper bound of Lagrange multipliers.\nLASSO [21] is an optimization problem to find sparse representation of some signals with respect to a predefined dictionary. It solves the following problem:\nmin x\n1 2 ‖Dx− y‖22 + λ‖x‖1, (2)\nwhere y is a testing point, D ∈ ℜp×n is a dictionary with dimension p and size n, λ is a parameter controls the sparsity of representation x. When both p and n are large, which is usually the case in practical applications, such as denoising or classification, it is difficult and time-intensive to compute. Screening [12] [13] is a technique used to reduce the size of dictionary using some rules in order to accelerate the computation of LASSO.\nEither in shrinking of SVM or in screening of LASSO, these approaches are trying to reduce the size of computation data. Inspired from these two techniques, we propose a faster and reliable approach for deep learning, shrinking Deep Learning."

      "heading" : "A. Standard Deep Learning",
      "text" : "Algorithm 1 gives the framework of standard deep learning. During each epoch (iteration), standard deep learning first runs a forward-propagation on all training data, then computes the output Y(w), where output Y is a function of weight parameters w. Deep learning tries to find an optimal w to minimize error loss e = [e1, ..., en], which can be sum squared error loss (DNN, DBN in our experiment) or softmax loss (CNN in our experiment). In backpropagation process, deep learning updates weight parameter vector using gradient descent. For an training data xi, gradient descent can be denoted as:\nw(epoch+1) = w(epoch) − η∇ei(w (epoch)), (3)\nwhere η is step size. Before we present shrinking Deep Leaning algorithm, we first give Lemma 1. Lemma 1: Magnitude of gradient ∇ei(w(epoch)) in Eq.(3) is positive correlated with the error ei, i = 1, ..., n.\nAlgorithm 1 Deep Learning (DL)\nInput: Data matrix X ∈ ℜp×n, class matrix Y(0) ∈ ℜn×c Output: Classification error 1: Preprocessing training data 2: Active training data index A = {1, 2, ..., n} 3: for epoch = 1, 2, ... do 4: Run forward-propagation on A 5: Compute forward-propagation output Y ∈ ℜn×c\n6: Run back-propagation 7: Update weight w using Eq.(3) 8: end for 9: Compute classification error using Y and Y(0)\nProof: In the case of sum squared error, error loss of sample xi is given as:\nei = 1\n2\nc∑\nk=1\n(yik(w)− y (0) ik ) 2, i = 1, ..., n. (4)\nUsing Eq.(4), gradient ∇ei(w) is:\n∇ei(w) =\nc∑\nk=1\n(yik(w)− y (0) ik )∇yik(w)\n∇ei(w) = ∇yi(w)(yi − y (0) i ) T . (5)\nAs we can see from Eq.(5), ∇ei(w) is linear related to (yi − y (0) i ). Data points with larger error will have larger gradient, thus will have a stronger and larger correction signal when updating w. Data points with smaller error will have smaller gradient, thus will have a weaker and smaller correction signal when updating w.\nIn the case of softmax loss function, ei is denoted as:\nei = − c∑\nk=1\ny (0) ik logpik, i = 1, ..., n (6)\npik = exp(yik(w))∑c j=1 exp(yij(w)) . (7)\nUsing Eq.(6), gradient ∇ei(w) is:\n∇ei(w) =\nc∑\nk=1\n∂ei(yik)\n∂yik ∇yik(w),\n∇ei(w) = c∑\nk=1\n(pik − y (0) ik )∇yik(w). (8)\nNow let’s see the relation between softmax loss function (Eq.(6)) and its gradient with respect to weight parameter w (Eq.(8)). For example, given point i is in class 1, so y (0) i1 = 1 and y (0) ij = 0, j 6= 1. When pi1 is large, pi1 → 1, softmax loss function (Eq.(6)) is very small. For gradient of softmax loss function (Eq.(8)), when k = 1, (pi1 − 1) is close to 0; when k 6= 1, (pi1 − 0) is also close to 0. In summary, when softmax loss function (Eq.(6)) is very small, its gradient (Eq.(8)) is also very small.\nAlgorithm 2 Shrinking Deep Learning (sDL)\nInput: Data matrix X ∈ ℜp×n, class matrix Y(0) ∈ ℜn×c, elimination rate s (s is a percentage), stop threshold t Output: Classification error 1: Preprocessing training data 2: Active training data index A = {1, 2, ..., n} 3: for epoch = 1, 2, ... do 4: Run forward-propagation on A 5: Compute forward-propagation output Y ∈ ℜn×c\n6: Run back-propagation 7: Update weight w using Eq.(3) 8: if nepoch >= t then 9: Compute error using Eq.(4)\n10: Compute set S, which contains indexes of nepochs smallest ei values (nepoch is size of A in current epoch) 11: Eliminate all samples in S and update A, A = A− S 12: end if 13: end for 14: Compute classification error using Y and Y(0)\nAlgorithm 3 Shrinking Deep Learning with Recall (sDLr)\nInput: Data matrix X ∈ ℜp×n, class matrix Y(0) ∈ ℜn×c, elimination rate s (s is a percentage), stop threshold t Output: Classification error 1: Preprocessing training data 2: Active training data index A = {1, 2, ..., n}, A0 = A 3: for epoch = 1, 2, ... do 4: Run forward-propagation on A 5: Compute forward-propagation output Y ∈ ℜn×c\n6: Run back-propagation 7: Update weight w using Eq.(3) 8: if nepoch >= t then 9: Compute error using Eq.(4)\n10: Compute set S, which contains indexes of nepochs smallest ei values (nepoch is size of A in current epoch) 11: Eliminate all samples in S and update A, A = A− S 12: else 13: Use all data for training, A = A0 14: end if 15: end for 16: Compute classification error using Y and Y(0)"

      "text" : "In order to accelerate computation and inspired from techniques of shrinking in SVM and screening of LASSO, we propose shrinking Deep Learning in Algorithm 2 by eliminating samples with small error (Eq.(4)) from training data and use less data for training.\nAlgorithm 2 gives the outline of shrinking Deep Learning (sDL). Compared to standard deep learning in Algorithm 1, sDL requires two more inputs, elimination rate s and stop threshold t. s is a percentage indicating the amount of training data to be eliminated during one epoch, t is a number indication to stop eliminating training data when nepoch < t, where nepoch is current number of training data. We maintain an index vector A. In Algorithm 1, both forward and backward propagation apply on all training\ndata. In Algorithm 2, the training process is applied on a subset of all training data. In the first epoch, we set A = {1, 2, ..., n} to include all training indexes. After forward and backward propagation in each epoch, we select the nepochs indexes of training data with smallest error ei, where nepoch is size of current number of training data A. Then we eliminate indexes in S from A, and update A, A = A− S. When nepoch < t, we stop eliminating training data anymore. Lemma 1 gives theoretical foundation that samples with small error will smaller impact on the gradient. Thus eliminating those samples will not impact the gradient significantly. Figure 2 shows that the errors using sDL is smaller than errors using DL, which proves that sDL gives a stronger correction signal and reduce the errors faster.\nWhen eliminating samples, elimination rate s denotes the percentage of samples to be removed. We select the nepochs indexes of training data with smallest error ei. For the same epoch, in different batches, the threshold used to eliminate samples is different. Assume there are nbatch batches one epoch, in every batch, we need to drop nepochs/nbatch samples on average. In batch i, let the threshold to drop nepochs/nbatch smallest error be ti; in batch i + 1, let the threshold be ti+1. ti and ti+1 will differ a lot. We use exponential smoothing [22] to adjust the threshold used in batch i+1: instead of using ti+1 as the threshold to eliminate samples, we use the following t′i+1:\nt′i+1 = αt ′ i + (1− α)ti+1, (9)\nwhere α ∈ [0, 1) is a weight parameter which controls the importance of past threshold values, t′1 = t1. The intuition using exponential smoothing is that we want the threshold used in each epoch to be consistent. Samples with errors less than t′i+1 in batch i+1 will be eliminated. If α is close to 0, the smoothing effect on threshold is not obvious; if α is close to 1, the threshold t′i+1 will deviate a lot from ti+1. In practical, we find α between 0.5 and 0.6 is a good setting in terms of smoothing threshold. We will show this in experiment part."

We now introduce shrinking Deep Learning with recall (Algorithm 3) to deal with this situation. In order to utilize all the training data, when the number of active training samples nepoch < t, we start to use all training samples, as shown in Algorithm 3, A = A0. Algorithm 3 ensures that the model trained is optimized for the entire training data. Shrinking with recall of Algorithm 3 will produce competitive classification performance with standard Deep Learning of Algorithm 1. In experiment, we will also investigate the impact the threshold t on the classification results (see Figure 7)."

(10)\nRecall is a technique when the number of training samples is decreased to a threshold t, we start to use all training samples. There is a trade-off between speedup and classification error: setting a lower t could reduce computation time more, but could increase classification error. Figure 7 shows the effect of using different recall threshold t sDNNr on MNIST data. When we bring all training samples back at t = 20%× 60K , we get the best testing error. It is worth noting that the classification error of sDNNr is improved compared to standard DNN, which could imply that there is less overfitting for this data set.\nFigure 8 shows an example of exponential smoothing on the elimination threshold (Eq.(9)) during one epoch.

Deep Learning trains a large number of parameters for multiple layers and is very slow when data is in large scale and the architecture size is large. Inspired from the shrinking technique used in accelerating computation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and screening technique used in LASSO, we propose a shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) approach to speed up deep learning computation. We experiment shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) using Deep Neural Network (DNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) on 4 data sets. Results show that the speedup using shrinking Deep Learning with recall (sDLr) can reach more than 2.0 while still giving competitive classification performance.
