      "text" : "Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are high-cost, limited-resource environments where quick and accurate decision-making is extremely valuable. However, most decision-making is often made in settings of high uncertainty and based just on the clinician’s prior experience. With the rapid rise in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) available for analysis, data-driven models are well-suited to aid physicians in making decisions about when patients should be treated with or weaned off certain interventions [1].\nAchieving high-quality care depends on a robust understanding of the patient’s underlying acuity throughout time [2]. Traditional measures of acuity are often based on mortality evaluated at a single endpoint [3, 4], or on static scores such as SAPS that don’t take into account evolving clinical information [5, 6].\nWe aim to create richer representations of patient health with the end goal of predicting actionable interventions. The efficacy of interventions can drastically vary from patient to patient, and unnecessarily administering an intervention can be harmful and expensive [7]. A model of patient health that is able to capture complex relationships in physiological signals is key to accurately predicting onset/weaning of interventions for different patients and necessary for successful personalized medicine.\nThis type of patient phenotyping is challenging because robust representations of human physiology are complicated, and contain many non-obvious dependencies between observed measurements. Moreover, modelling evolving clinical information requires using timeseries data, but this data is often varying-length, irregularly sampled or has missing values. Previously, multitask gaussian processes have been tested for modelling patient acuity but only in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients [8] or only using longitudinal billing data [2].\nOur approach uses autoencoders for physiological timeseries signal reconstruction. Autoencoders deep neural networks where the target values are the same as the input values, and the hidden layer(s) compress the inputs into a lower dimensional embedding. Since this embedding tries to reconstruct the original input, it must capture fundamental features about the input timeseries, and can be used as a measure of underlying patient acuity. Feature learning in this approach is entirely unsupervised, so unlike traditional acuity scores it is not limited by a manually-defined feature space.

      "text" : "Previous work has attempted to use autoencoders on random 30-day patches of input vectors to learn underlying patient phenotypes [9], and has shown that they can extract relevant and useful features about patients.\nIt is also valuable to consider signals that occur throughout a patient’s stay, since there are often long delays between when relevant signals are expressed [10].\nSequence autoencoders take in measured signals one timestep at a time into a layer of LSTM (LongShort Term Memory) cells and produce a fixed-length embedding. This embedding is then used as input to another layer of LSTM cells that try to predict the original input sequence.\nLSTM cells are used because of their ability to effectively model varying-length timeseries data and capture long-term dependencies. LSTMs have achieved state-of-the-art results in many different natural language processing applications from machine translation [11] to dialogue systems [12] to image captioning [13]. They are well-suited to modeling clinical data because evidence of certain conditions may be spread apart over several hours or days, and important symptoms may present early on in a patient’s stay.\nSequence autoencoders using LSTM cells were inspired by the success of general sequence-tosequence models applied to machine translation. They were recently used as an initialization step for recurrent neural networks for text classification [14], but have not been applied to the clinical space."

      "text" : "Features were extracted from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) Database [15]. Since 2001, the MIMIC database has been built up and maintained by the Laboratory of Computational Physiology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Philips Healthcare, with support from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioinformatics. The database contains general patient information (ICD-9 codes, demographics, room tracking), physiological signals (vital metrics, SAPS), medications (IV meds, provider order entry data), lab tests (chemistry, imaging), fluid balance (in- take, output), and notes (discharge summary, nursing progress reports). The most recent version of MIMIC III contains data from around 38,600 adults, comprising over 58,000 hospital admissions, from 2001-2012. The MIMIC dataset is notable because it is publicly available for free use, encompasses a large and diverse set of patients, and contains numerous high resolution features for each patient.\nWe use data from from the first ICU stay of patients in the Medical Care Unit (MICU), Cardiac Care Unit (CCU), Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU), Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), and Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit (TSICU). We only look at patients older than 15 and who were in the ICU for between 12 and 2000 hours. This totals 35,554 unique patients/ICU stays. We extract 30 physiological features for each patient as timeseries spanning their entire stay. Measurements are given timestamps that are rounded to the nearest hour, and if an hour has multiple measurements for a signal those are averaged.\nSince there are many missing values, we first backfill using any present values the patient has, and then fill in remaining missing values with the mean value for that variable across all patients.\nThe data is split into training/validation/testing sets with a 70/15/15 split, stratified on in-hospital mortality in order to have a spectrum of patient severity in both the train and test sets."

We also compare the performance of these models over inputs of different interval lengths, specifically 4, 16, 32 and 64 hours. We train on mini-batches of 128 samples with early stopping to determine the number of epochs.\nFor the fixed-length input autoencoders, we concatenate all 30 features for each hour throughout the given interval length. We use an embedding size equal to the total number of input values divided by 10 to achieve a compression factor of 10x. All hidden layers use a ReLU activation function, and the output layer uses a sigmoidal activation function."

      "text" : "We evaluate the performance of each autoencoder by taking the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted sequence of values and the true sequence of values. The sequential autoencoder with one LSTM layer achieves a lower MSE than the single-layer fixed length autoencoder on all interval lengths, but varies in comparison to the double-layer fixed length autoencoder (Figure 2).\nWe also show that reconstructing input timeseries with autoencoders is fairly robust to stratifications in population subsets. We run the autoencoders on intervals of 32 hours with patient subsets stratified by care unit. MSEs are higher than when the autoencoders were trained on the entire patient population, but less than 0.08 in all cases, even though the training sets are much smaller (Figure 3). On these smaller subsets of patients, the sequence autoencoder appears to be able to generalize better with smaller amounts of training data and does better in all cases.\nFigure 2: Performance of autoencoders on reconstructing timeseries input of various lengths.\nFigure 3: Performance of autoencoders on patient population subsets with intervals of 32 hours.\nWe plan to compare the performance of patient embeddings from different autoencoder structures to predict onset of and weaning off of dialysis. We will compare its performance on its own and as an additional feature matrix concatenated to the raw feature values.\nIt will also be interesting to experiment with deeper sequential autoencoder structures, or to use bidirectional LSTM cells in the hidden layers to better reconstruct inputs."
