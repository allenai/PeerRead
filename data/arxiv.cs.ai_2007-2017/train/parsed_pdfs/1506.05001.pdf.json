To this purpose, a sequence of Face Image Descriptors (FID) is regarded as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system. The temporal dynamics of such sequence of descriptors are represented by means of a Hankel matrix.\nThe paper presents different strategies to compute dynamics-based representation of a sequence of FID, and reports classification accuracy values of the proposed representations within different standard classification frameworks. The representations have been validated in two very challenging application domains: emotion recognition and pain detection. Experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that the dynamics-based FID representation attains competitive performance when off-theshelf classification tools are adopted."

      "text" : "Facial expression analysis and emotion recognition are of interest in several domains such as human-computer interaction and social behavior understanding. Especially in socially assistive robotics [23] and computational behavioral science [24], [19], recognition of face expressions and emotions may help either to improve interactions with a robot, or to study people’s social engagement in collaborative tasks [17], [35].\nMoreover, face expression analysis could be useful in automatic pain monitoring, which in turn may help to ensure proper treatment to the patient [20]. Recent works, such as [21],[12], [27], [2],[25], [26], [9], [10] have focused on pain/no-pain detection and pain intensity estimation. These problems require the analysis of spontaneous facial expressions in the wild, namely under strong variations of head\npose and face expressions. Pain detection suffers also of the difficulty to annotate the data in an objective way. Whilst patient’s self-report is inexpensive and does not require for special skills, it has the drawback to be subjective, and it lacks of specific timing information [20]. Therefore, not only there are strong inter-patient variations in face expressions, but there are variations also in the pain self-reports.\nTypically, approaches for emotion recognition tend to extract a representation of the face appearance, and adopt some classification framework. Some approaches [29] use a frame-based representation; others [6], [18], [30] use also temporal information. The latter works are motivated by the fact that face emotions are not instantaneous and the temporal evolution of face image descriptors (FIDs) can help to discriminate among emotions. Holistic representation of a sequence of FIDs, such as [29], lacks of temporal information, which instead proved to be useful [3].\nIn this paper, we propose to use the temporal dynamics of a sequence of FIDs to recognize among different emotions. Dynamics-based methods for emotion recognition have been proposed in [6] where a descriptor based on the movement of facial landmarks along the image sequence, and spatio-temporal appearance features are adopted. While [6] attempts to embed information about the dynamics at a feature representation level, works such as [18], [30] attempt to account for the temporal structure of the sequences of FIDs in the emotion model.\nIn contrast to these works, we propose to model a sequence of FIDs as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system in order to perform dynamics-based emotion recognition. System identification [13], [8] or compressive sensing-based techniques [28] could be used to compare different emotion instances. However, previous works [14], [16] have shown that it may be possible to avoid the burden of performing system identification by representing the output of a LTI system through the corresponding Hankel matrix. Therefore, in this paper we explore the use\nof Hankel matrices in the domain of face analysis. The use of Hankel matrices, jointly with the dissimilarity score in [14], presents advantages in terms of space and time complexity.\nIn this paper, we propose different strategies to compute a dynamics-based representation that employs Hankel matrices. Our dynamics-based representation permits to easily compare sequences of different lengths. Comparison of sequences of different length is one of the major challenge in emotion classification. We present experiments in two different kinds of applications: emotion recognition and pain detection, and we conduct an extensive validation on two publicly available benchmarks. The first benchmark is the extended Cohn-Kanade dataset [19], which allows us to study the validity of this kind of feature representation for emotion recognition; the second dataset is the very challenging PAINFUL dataset [20], which allows us to study the proposed feature representation for pain localization in the wild. Our experiments show that, with standard and widely used classifiers such as nearest neighbor, linear SVM and HMM, our dynamics-based emotion representation allows us to consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition in comparison to methods that use more complex machinery and costly training procedure.\nThe plan of the work is as follows. In Section 2, we present works that are related to our feature representation. In Section 3 we describe how we use a Hankel matrix to represent face emotions. In Section 4 we provide details of the adopted classification frameworks and in Section 5, we present extensive validation of the dynamics-based representation. Finally, in Section 6, we present conclusions and future directions."

      "text" : "There is an extensive literature on face recognition [37], [15] and on facial expression analysis [35], [7]. Here we focus on works that try to embed the temporal structure of the sequence of facial expression either in the feature representation step or in the emotion-model.\nIn particular, [11] uses a Constrained Local Model (CLM) to obtain facial landmarks. Then it extracts patches around these markers. A sparse representation of the patches is obtained by applying non-negative matrix factorization. Classification is performed by least-square SVM. In [6], a descriptor based on the movement of facial landmark points over time, jointly with spatio-temporal appearance features is extracted for each face image sequence. The method attempts to measure horizontal and vertical movements of tracked landmarks of different face parts such as eyebrows, eyelids, cheeks, and lip corners. To account for temporal changes in the face appearance, Complete Local Binary Patterns from Three Orthogonal Planes (LBP-\nTOP) [36] are used. Classification is performed by SVM. In [22], restricted Boltzmann machine with local interactions (LRBM) is used to capture spatio-temporal patterns in the data. RBM is used as a generative model for data representation, and data need to be pre-aligned.\nSince a sequence of FIDs is a time series, and may be affected by temporal warping, in [18] time-series kernel methods are used for emotional expression estimation using landmark data only. The work shows that emotion recognition may be done by adopting either the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) kernel or the Global Alignment (GA) kernel [4, 5]. Our approach does not require any alignment of the data, and enables the comparison of sequences of different temporal duration.\nTo capture temporal information about the sequence of FIDs, Bayesian networks can be adopted. Wang et al. [33] propose to use Interval Temporal Bayesian Network (ITBN) to capture the spatial and temporal relations among primitive facial events. First, primitive facial events are identified, then ITBN is applied to model the interactions of primitives for expression recognition. In [30], a Bayesian approach is used to model dynamic facial expression temporal transitions. A face appearance representation is computed in terms of Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and an expression manifold is derived for multiple subjects. A Bayesian temporal model (similar to HMM with a non parametric observation model) of the manifold is used to represent facial expression dynamics.\nIn this paper, we model a sequence of FIDs by means of a dynamical system of unknown parameters. The parameters of the dynamical system are embedded in our Hankel matrix-based representation. Such representation aims at capturing the correlation among different face parts over time. Hankel matrices have already been adopted for action recognition in [14], which adopts a Hankel matrix-based bag-of-words approach, and in [16], which models an action as a sequence of Hankel matrices and uses a set of HMM trained in a discriminative way to model the switching between LTI systems. In contrast to these papers, we use Hankel matrices to describe the temporal dynamics of sequences of FIDs. We compare different strategies to compute a dynamics-based representation that employs Hankel matrices. We also test the effectiveness of our representation for emotion recognition within several standard classification frameworks."

We compare three different dynamics-based emotion representations, that we describe in the following.\n• Single Hankel matrix representation: this representation uses the whole time series Y to build the Hankel\nmatrix. We note that, even if the sequences may have different length, the matrix H ·HT used in Eq. 4 is a squared symmetric matrix and Hankel matrices of sequences of different lengths are easily comparable.\n• Sliding window-based representation: while the former representation assumes segmentation of the frame\nsequence into emotions, this representation could overcome this requirement by representing Y through a sequence of overlapping temporal window (similar to [16]). However, it may also limit the applicability of some classification frameworks (such as linear SVM) because sequence representations may have different lengths.\n• LTI Codebook-based representation: in this representation, a bag-of-LTI-systems approach is used.\nFirst, the sequence Y is represented by means of a single Hankel matrix H . From a training set, a codebook of LTI systems C = �Ci}, with Ci representing a Hankel matrix, is computed by using K-medoids on the dissimilarity score in Eq. 4. The representation of a time series Y is formed by concatenating the dissimilarity score of the Hankel matrix H and each of the elements Ci in the codebook. L2-normalization is applied on the extracted descriptor. Sequences of FIDs are represented by descriptors of the same length."

In this paper, to demonstrate the whole framework, we consider shape features provided by an active appearance model [19], [20]. Therefore, face expressions are represented as trajectories of 2D facial landmarks as shown in Fig. 1. To build the Hankel matrices, we use the following frame-based feature representations:\n• concatenated 2D facial landmark coordinates (L);\n• pairwise landmark distances (D);\n• concatenation of pairwise landmark distances and landmark coordinates (L+D).\nFor each of these representations, principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied for noise and dimensionality reduction. We have selected a number of projections covering 99� of the total variance. The retained PCA coefficients are then used to build the dynamics-based representation as explained in Section 3.\n3We used the HMM toolbox available at http://www.cs.ubc.ca/�murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html. We modified the code in such a way that the observation model is an exponential distribution and each state is a LTI system represented by an exemplar Hankel matrix.\nThe adopted features are meant to represent the behavior of different parts of the face. The distance-based expression representation captures also the reciprocal relations among face parts (for example the joint movement of eyebrows and lips), and it is independent on the head movements on the image plane. The concatenation of distances and landmark coordinates permits to represent reciprocal relations of face parts given the face shape."

The main difficulty in this domain arises from the strong inter-subject variations, especially in some kind of emotions (such as sadness). Other challenges are connected with the difficulty to extract reliable feature representations due to illumination changes, biometric differences, head pose changes. Moreover, the lack of depth information makes emotion recognition more difficult due to ambiguities in the facial shape representation. To demonstrate the idea behind this paper, we restrict the attention to segmented emotion recognition in frontal view as done also in previous works such as [18], [1], [22], [33]."

The table reports the per-class classification accuracy values for each emotion class and the average accuracy value.\nThe table is divided in 4 parts. The first part compares dynamics-based representations when the Hankel matrix is\ncomputed over the whole sequence. We compare the single Hankel matrix representation with the nearest neighbor classifier against the LTI system codebook-based representation and linear one-vs-all SVMs.\nThe second part of the table compares the sliding window-based representation within three classification frameworks: dynamic time warping and NN classifier, NN classifier and majority vote, hidden Markov models.\nThe third part of Table 1 reports the results obtained directly on the raw features (without computing any Han-\nkel matrix) in order to highlight the advantage of using the dynamics-based representation. As the sequences have different lengths, we cannot apply the NN classifier directly on the raw features, but we are forced to align the sequences via DTW. We are not presenting results on the raw data via SVM because this experiment would be similar to the baseline method reported in [19] (in the lower part of the table). The fourth part of the table reports accuracy values of works at the state-of-the-art on equal terms of input data, which means that all the works we compare with use only\n2D facial landmarks.\nDue to the randomness in the codebook generation of the CSVM method and in the state initialization procedure in HMM, the experiments for CSVM and HMM have been repeated 10 times, and average accuracy values are reported.\nOverall, the experimental results show that the dynamics-based emotion representation achieves state-ofthe-art performance almost within all the tested classification frameworks. The highest accuracy values are obtained when the whole sequence is used. Among the sliding window-based approaches, only when adopting NN and majority vote the performance are comparable or higher than the one reported in [22]. These experiments suggest that probably emotions can be represented as the output of just one LTI system and there may be no dynamics switching as instead may happen in human actions [16]. The results also show how, in general, pairwise distances are more informative than 2D landmark trajectories. The concatenation of distances and landmarks (L+D) provides only a small improvement of the performance, with a general increase of the dimensionality of the representation. Finally, we note that the adoption of Hankel matrices permits to achieve an increase of more than 63� (on average) of the accuracy value obtained classifying directly the raw facial features."

Pain may be a sporadic episode of varying duration, and painful facial expressions may vary greatly from subject-tosubject or be confused with other emotions.\nIn this paper we treat pain detection as a binary classification problem. We adopt a sliding window approach and classify each temporal window in order to detect the pain event. We empirically set the length of the temporal window to 10 frames."

      "text" : "To test our dynamics-based FID representation for pain detection, we use the Painful dataset [20]. This dataset contains videos of patients’ faces while they were moving their painful shoulder. The goal is that of recognizing between pain and no-pain events. The videos were annotated on a frame-per-frame basis with the Prkachin and Solomon pain intensity (PSPI) score [20], which ranges in [0, 15] where 0 means no pain, while a value greater than 0 indicates a certain intensity of pain. However, our method works on temporal windows and the validation requires a temporal window-based annotation. To account for this, we consider the integral score IS, obtained by summing the PSPI score\nin a sliding window. We set the label of the temporal window to 0 if IS < ψ, and to 1 if IS ≥ ψ. Here ψ indicates a threshold value on the integral score. A low value of IS means that some frames in the temporal window have PSPI higher than 1; however, most of the frames in the window may score PSPI 0. To test the ability of our descriptor to represent pain events, we test our approach with different values of ψ in leave-one-subject-out cross validation.\nFinally, we note that this dataset is challenging also because faces are not always in frontal view, and the landmark points are affected by strong head movements. Therefore, on this dataset it is of particular interest the comparison between landmark-based and pairwise distance-based dynamics representation."

We test such representation on landmarks (L) and on pairwise distance (D) measurements within two frameworks: NN and CSVM.\nWhen adopting NN, the training set has been reduced by selecting only K medoids for each class, with K set to 300. When adopting CSVM, a codebook of 50 Hankel matrices is learned on the training set by K-medoids.\nWe report in columns the values of the confusion matrices for our binary classification experiment given the corresponding threshold value ψ. Positive indicates the pain event, while Negative indicates the no-pain event. Therefore TPR (true positive rate) and TNR (true negative rate) are the diagonal values of the confusion matrix. FNR (false negative rate) and FPR (false positive rate) are the extradiagonal values. We also present the average classification accuracy (the average of the diagonal values).\nTable 2 is divided into 4 parts. The first part reports values of the NN classifier when the Hankel matrix is computed directly on the landmark trajectories. The second part of the table reports values of the NN classifier when the Hankel matrix is computed on the pairwise landmark distances across time. By comparing the results, it is possible to observe that the pairwise distance-based representation achieves higher TPR for all the threshold values. The increase of the average accuracy for ψ = 1 is of around 18�, which is much higher than what observed on the CK+ dataset. We believe that, on these data, head motion might affect the landmark-based representation. On the contrary, pairwise distances are more invariant to head motion.\nThe third and fourth parts of the table reports accuracy values respectively for the landmark-based and pairwise distance-based measurements when adopting the LTI Codebook-based SVM approach.

To this purpose, a sequence of Face Image Descriptors (FID) is regarded as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system. The temporal dynamics of such sequence of descriptors are represented by means of a Hankel matrix. The paper presents different strategies to compute dynamics-based representation of a sequence of FID, and reports classification accuracy values of the proposed representations within different standard classification frameworks. The representations have been validated in two very challenging application domains: emotion recognition and pain detection. Experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that the dynamics-based FID representation attains competitive performance when off-theshelf classification tools are adopted.",
