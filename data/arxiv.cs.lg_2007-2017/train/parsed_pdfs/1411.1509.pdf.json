      "text" : "Since their introduction in the early 1990s, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used to achieve excellent performance on a variety of tasks such as handwriting recognition and face detection. More recently, supervised deep convolutional neural networks have been shown to deliver high level performance on more challenging classification tasks [Krizhevsky, et al., 2012]. The key supporting factors behind these impressive results are their ability to learn tens of millions of parameters using large amounts of labelled data. Once trained in this way, CNNs have been shown to learn discriminative and humaninterpretable feature representations [Zeiler and Fergus, 2013]. Most impressively, these approaches are capable of producing state of the art performance on tasks that the model was not explicitly trained for [Donahue, et al., 2013], including object recognition on the Caltech101 dataset [Fei-Fei, et al., 2007], subcategory recognition on the Caltech-USCD birds dataset [Welinder, et al., 2010], scene recognition on the SUN397 dataset [Xiao, et al., 2010] and object detection on\nThe authors are with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Queensland University of Technology, Australia. http://roboticvision.org/. email: zetao.chen@student.qut.edu.au. This work was supported by a funding from the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence CE140100016 in Robotic Vision.\nthe PASCAL VOC dataset [Girshick, et al., 2013]. This good generalization in performance on new tasks and datasets indicates that CNNs may provide a general and universal visual feature learning framework applicable to all tasks. Encouraged by these positive results, in this paper we develop a place recognition framework centered around features from pre-trained CNNs as illustrated in Figure 1.\nPlace recognition can be considered as an image retrieval task which consists of determining a match between the current scene and a previously visited location. State-of-the-art visual SLAM algorithms such as FAB-MAP [Cummins and Newman, 2008] match the appearance of the current scene to a past place by converting the image into bag-of-words representations [Angeli, et al., 2008] built on local features such as SIFT or SURF. However, recent evidence [Krizhevsky, et al., 2012] suggests that features extracted from CNNs trained on very large datasets significantly outperform SIFT features on classification tasks. Donahue [Donahue, et al., 2013] shows that using mid-level features from CNN models trained on the ImageNet database can more efficiently remove dataset bias in some of the domain adaption studies than a bag of words approach.\nIn this paper we investigate whether the advantages of deep learning in other recognition tasks carries over to place recognition. We present a deep learning-based place recognition algorithm that compares the response of feature layers from a CNN trained on ImageNet [Deng, et al., 2009] and methods for filtering the subsequent place recognition hypotheses. We conduct two experiments, one on a 70 km benchmark place recognition dataset, and one on a viewpoint varying dataset, providing both quantitative comparison to two state of the art place recognition algorithms and analysis of the utility of different layers within the network for viewpoint invariance.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of feature-based place recognition techniques and convolutional neural networks. In Section 3 we describe the components of the deep learning-based place recognition system. The experiments are described in Section 4, with results presented in Section 5. Finally we conclude the paper in Section 6 and discuss ongoing and future work."

      "text" : "Visual sensors are increasingly becoming the predominant sensor modality for place recognition due to their low cost, low power requirements, small footprint and rich information content. There has been extensive research on how to best represent and match images of places.\nSeveral authors have described approaches that apply global feature techniques to process incoming sensor information. In [Murillo and Kosecka., 2009], the authors propose a gist feature-based place recognition system using panoramic images for urban environments. Histograms of image gray values or texture is also a widely used feature in place recognition systems [Ulrich and Nourbakhsh, 2000, Blaer and Allen, 2002] due to its compact representation rotation invariance. However, global features are computed from the entire image, rendering them unsuitable to effects such as partial occlusion, lighting change or perspective transformation [Deselaers, et al., 2008].\nLocal features are less sensitive to these external factors and have been widely used in appearance-based loop closure detection, SIFT [Lowe, 1999] and SURF [Herbert Bay, et al., 2008] being two widespread examples. State-of-the-art SLAM systems such as FABMAP [Cummins and Newman, 2008] further represent appearance data using sets of local features, converting images into “bag-of-words”, which enables efficient retrieval. Other feature-less representations have also been proposed. SeqSLAM [Milford and Wyeth, 2012] directly uses pixel values to match image sequences and perform place recognition across extreme perceptual changes. However, it is rapidly becoming apparent in other recognition tasks that hand-crafted features are being outperformed by learnt features, prompting the\nquestion of whether we can learn better features automatically?"

      "heading" : "2.2 Convolutional Neural Networks",
      "text" : "Convolutional neural networks are multi-layer supervised networks which can learn features automatically from datasets (Figure 3). For the last few years, CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in almost all important classification tasks [Krizhevsky, et al., 2012, Donahue, et al., 2013, Sharif Razavian, et al., 2014]. Their primary disadvantage is that they require very large amounts of training data. However, recent studies have shown that state of the art performance can be achieved with networks trained using “generic” data, raising the possibility of developing a place recognition system based on features learnt from datasets with a classification focus. A similar approach has already achieved excellent performance on various visual tasks, such as object recognition [Fei-Fei, et al., 2007]; subcategory recognition [Welinder, et al., 2010]; scene recognition [Xiao, et al., 2010] and detection [Girshick, et al., 2013].\nOne research area separate but relevant to the place recognition problem is the task of image retrieval where a query image is present to a database to search for those images containing the same objects or scenes. In [Babenko, et al., 2014], mid-level features from CNNs are evaluated for the image retrieval application and achieve performance comparable to others using stateof-the-art features. Interestingly, the best performance is obtained using mid-network features rather than those learnt at the final layers.\nPlace recognition is essentially a task of image similarity matching. In [Fischer, et al., 2014], features from various layers of CNNs are evaluated and compared with SIFT descriptors on a descriptor matching benchmark. The benchmark results demonstrate that deep features from different layers of CNNs consistently perform better than SIFT on descriptor matching; indicating that SIFT or SURF may not be the preferred descriptors for matching tasks anymore. Our paper is thus inspired by the excellent performance of CNNs on image classification and the evidence of their feasibility in feature matching."

      "text" : "We use a pretrained network called Overfeat [Sermanet, et al., 2013] which was originally proposed for the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013). The Overfeat network is trained on the ImageNet 2012 dataset, which consists of 1.2 million images and 1000 classes. The network comprises five convolution stages and three fully connected stages (Figure 3). Each of the bottom two convolution stages consists of a convolution layer, a max pooling layer and a rectification (ReLU) nonlinearity layer. The third and fourth stages consist of a convolution layer, a zero-padding layer and a ReLU non-linear layer. The fifth stage contains a convolution layer, a zero-padding layer, a ReLU layer and a maxpooling layer. Finally, the sixth and seventh stages contain one fully-connected layer and one ReLU layer, while the eighth contains only the fully-connected output layer. In total, there are 21 layers.\nWhen an image I is input into the network, it produces a sequence of layered activations. We use , = 1,… ,21 to denote the corresponding output of the layer given input image I. Each of these vectors is a deep learnt representation of the image I; place recognition is performed by comparing these feature vector responses to different images. The network is capable of processing images of any size equal to or greater than 231 × 231 pixels, consequently all experiments described here used images resized to 256 × 256 pixels."

In this paper, we present for the first time a place recognition technique based on CNN models, by combining the powerful features learnt by CNNs with a spatial and sequential filter. Applying the system to a 70 km benchmark place recognition dataset we achieve a 75% increase in recall at 100% precision, significantly outperforming all previous state of the art techniques. We also conduct a comprehensive performance comparison of the utility of features from all 21 layers for place recognition, both for the benchmark dataset and for a second dataset with more significant viewpoint changes.",
