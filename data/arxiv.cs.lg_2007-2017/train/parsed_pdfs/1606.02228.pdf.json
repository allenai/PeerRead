      "text" : "The paper systematically studies the impact of a range of recent advances in CNN architectures and learning methods on the object categorization (ILSVRC) problem. The evalution tests the influence of the following choices of the architecture: non-linearity (ReLU, ELU, maxout, compatability with batch normalization), pooling variants (stochastic, max, average, mixed), network width, classifier design (convolutional, fully-connected, SPP), image pre-processing, and of learning parameters: learning rate, batch size, cleanliness of the data, etc.\nThe performance gains of the proposed modifications are first tested individually and then in combination. The sum of individual gains is bigger than the observed improvement when all modifications are introduced, but the ”deficit” is small suggesting independence of their benefits.\nWe show that the use of 128x128 pixel images is sufficient to make qualitative conclusions about optimal network structure that hold for the full size Caffe and VGG nets. The results are obtained an order of magnitude faster than with the standard 224 pixel images.\nKeywords: CNN, benchmark, non-linearity, pooling, ImageNet"

With good results in ImageNet competition,\nPreprint submitted to Computer Vision and Image Understanding June 8, 2016\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 22\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 7\nJ un\nthe AlexNet [10], VGGNet [11] and GoogLeNet(Inception) [12] have become the de-facto standard.\nImprovements of many components of the CNN architecture like the nonlinearity type, pooling, structure and learning have been recently proposed. First applied in the ILSVRC [1] competition, they have been adopted in different research areas.\nThe contributions of the recent CNN improvements and their interaction have not been systematically evaluated. We survey the recent developments and perform a large scale experimental study that considers the choice of nonlinearity, pooling, learning rate policy, classifier design, network width, batch normalization [13]. We did not include ResNets [14] – a recent development achieving excellent results – since they have been well covered in papers [15, 16, 17, 18].\nThere are three main contributions of the paper. First, we survey and present baseline results for a wide variety of architectures and design choices both alone and in combination. Based on large-scale evaluation, we provide novel recommendations and insights about construction deep convolutional network. Second, we present ImageNet-128px as fast (24 hours of training AlexNet on GTX980) and reliable benchmark – the relative order of results for popular architectures does not change compared to common image size 224x224 or even 300x300 pixels. Last, but not least, the benchmark is fully reproducible and all scripts and data are available online1.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2.1 we explain and validate experiment design. In Section 3, the influence of the a range of hyper-parameters is evaluated in isolation. The related literature is review the corresponding in experiment sections. Section 4 is devoted to the combination of best hyperparameter setting and to “squeezing-the-last-percentage-points” for a given architecture recommendation. The paper is concluded in Section 5."

The reduction of the input image size leads to a consistent drop in top-1 accuracy around 6% for all there popular architectures and does not change their relative order (VGGNet > GoogLeNet > CaffeNet) or accuracy difference.\nIn order to decrease the probability of overfitting and to make experiments less demanding in memory, another change of CaffeNet is made. A number of filters in fully-connected layers 6 and 7 were reduced by a factor of two, from 4096 to 2048. The results validating the resolution reduction are presented in Figure 1.\nThe parameters and architecture of the standard CaffeNet are shown in Table 2.

Formulas and references are given in Table 3. We have selected APL and maxout with two linear pieces. Maxout is tested in two modifications: MaxW – having the same effective network width, which doubles the number of parameters and computation costs because of the two linear pieces, and MaxS – having same computational complexity - with√\n2 thinner each piece. Besides this, we have tested ”optimally scaled” tanh, proposed by LeCun [8]. We have also tried to train sigmoid [32] network, but the initial loss never decreased. Finally, as proposed by Swietojanski et.al [33], we have tested combination of ReLU for first layers and maxout for the last layers of the network.\nResults are shown in Figure 2. The best single performing activation function similar in complexity to ReLU is ELU. The parametric PReLU performed on par. The performance of the centered softplus is the same as for ELU. Surprisingly, Very Leaky ReLU, popular for DCGAN networks [34] and for small datasets, does not outperforms vanilla ReLU. Interesting, the network with no\nnon-linearity has respectable performance – 38.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, not much worse than tanh-network.\nThe Swietojanski et.al [33] hypothesis about maxout power in the final layers is confirmed and combined ELU (after convolutional layers) + maxout (after fully connected layers) shows the best performance among non-linearities with speed close to ReLU. Wide maxout outperforms the rest of the competitors at a higher computational cost."

The most popular options are max pooling and average pooling. Among the recent advances are: Stochastic pooling [35], LP-Norm pooling [36] and Tree-Gated pooling [37]. Only the authors of the last paper have tested their pooling on ImageNet.\nThe pooling receptive field is another design choice. Krizhevskiy etal. [10] claimed superiority of overlapping pooling with 3x3 window size and stride 2, while VGGNet [11] uses a non-overlapping 2x2 window."

[38]. We have also tried Tree and Gated poolings [37], but we encountered convergence problems and the results were strongly depend on the input image size. We do not know if it is a problem of the implementation, or the method itself and therefore omitted the results.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3, left. Stochastic pooling had very bad results. In order to check if it was due to extreme randomization by the stochastic\npooling and dropout, we trained network without the dropout. This decreased accuracy even more. The best results were obtained by a combination of max and average pooling. Our guess is that max pooling brings selectivity and invariance, while average pooling allows using gradients of all filters, instead of throwing away 3/4 of information as done by non-overlapping 2x2 max pooling.\nThe second experiment is about the receptive field size. The results are shown in Figure 3, right. Overlapping pooling is inferior to a non-overlapping 2x2 window, but wins if zero-padding is done. This can be explained by the fact that better results are obtained for larger outputs; 3x3/2 pooling leads to 3x3 spatial size of pool5 feature map, 2x2/2 leads to 4x4 pool5, while 3x3/2 + 1 – to 5x5. This observation means there is a speed – performance trade-off."

While this works well in practice, such lazy policy can be sub-optimal. We have tested four learning rate policies: step, quadratic and square root decay (used for training GoogLeNet by BVLC [20]), and linear decay. The actual learning rate dynamics are shown in Figure 4, left. The validation accuracy is shown in the right. Linear decay gives the best results."

It decreases final accuracy by 0.3% and can be seen as baseline for all other methods. We have tested HSV, YCrCb, Lab, RGB and single-channel grayscale colorspaces. Results are shown in Figure 5. The experiment confirms that RGB is the best suitable colorspace for CNNs. Labbased network has not improved the initial loss after 10K iterations. Removing color information from images costs from 5.8% to 5.2% of the accuracy, for\nOpenCV RGB2Gray and learned decolorization resp. Global [42] and local (CLAHE [43]) histogram equalizations hurt performance as well.\nSecond, we let the network to learn a transformation via 1x1 convolution, so no pixel neighbors are involved. The mini-networks architectures are described in Table 6. The learning process is joint with the main network and can be seen as extending the CaffeNet architecture with several 1x1 convolutions at the input.

Following [22], we first tested different options where to put BN – before or after the non-linearity. Results presented in Table 7 are surprisingly contradictory: CaffeNet architecture prefers ConvReLU-BN-Conv, while GoogLeNet – Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv placement. Moreover, results for GoogLeNet are inferior to the plain network. The difference to [13] is that we have not changed any other parameters except using BN, while in the original paper, authors decreased regularization (both weight decay and dropout), changed the learning rate decay policy and applied an additional training set re-shuffling. Also, GoogLeNet behavior seems different to CaffeNet and VGGNet w.r.t. to other modification, see Section 4.\nFor the next experiment with BN and activations, we selected placement after non-linearity. Results are shown in Figure 6. Batch normalization washes out differences between ReLU-family variants, so there is no need to use the\nmore complex variants. Sigmoid with BN outperforms ReLU without it, but, surprisingly, tanh with BN shows worse accuracy than sigmoid with BN."

They argued that 2 fully-connected layers are not the optimal design and explored various architectures instead. But they considered only pre-trained CNN or HOGs as feature extractor, so explored mostly transfer learning scenario, when the most of the network weights are frozen. Also, they explored architectures with additional convolution layers, which can be seen not as better classifier, but as an enhancement of the feature extractor.\nThere is three the most popular approaches to classifier design. First – final layer of the feature extractor is max pooling layer and the classifier is a one or two layer MLP, as it is done in LeNet [45], AlexNet [10] and VGGNet [11]. Second – spatial pooling pyramid layer [46] instead of pooling layer, followed by two layer MLP. And the third architecture consist of average pooling layer, squashing spatial dimensions, followed by softmax classifier without any feature transform.

Here we explore the influence of mini-batch size on the final accuracy. Experiments show that keeping a constant learning rate for different mini-batch sizes has a negative impact on performance. We also have tested the heuristic proposed by Krizhevskiy [49] which suggests to keep the product of mini-batch size and learning rate constant. Results are shown in Figure8. The heuristics works, but large (512 and more) mini-batch sizes leads to quite significant decrease in performance.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no study about network width – final accuracy dependence. Canziani et.al [50] did a comparative analysis of the ImageNet winner in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and computational complexity, but it is a comparison of the different architectures. In this subsection we evaluate how far one can get by increasing CaffeNet width, with no other changes. The results are shown in Figure 9. The original architecture is close to optimal in accuracy per FLOPS sense: a decrease in the number of filters leads to a quick and significant accuracy drop, while making the network thicker brings gains, but it saturates quickly. Making the network thicker more than 3 times leads to a very limited accuracy gain."

Our initial experiment, showed in Figure 1 indicates that CaffeNet, trained on 227x227 images can compete with much more complex GoogLeNet architecture, trained on smaller\nimages. So the obvious question is what is the dependence between image size and final accuracy.\nWe have performed an experiment with different input image sizes: 96, 128, 180 and 224 pixels wide. The results are presented in Figure 10. The bad news are that while accuracy depends on image size linearly, the needed computations grow quadratically, so it is a very expensive way to a performance gain. In the second part of experiment, we kept the spatial output size of the pool1 layer fixed while changing the input image size. To archieve this, we respectively change the stride and filter size of the conv1 layer. Results show that the gain from a large image size mostly (after some minimum value) comes from the larger spatial size of deeper layers than from the unseen image details."

If this is too big for your GPU,\ndecrease the learning rate proportionally to the batch size. • use fully-connected layers as convolutional and average the predictions for\nthe final decision. • when investing in increasing training set size, check if a plateau has not\nbeen reach. • cleanliness of the data is more important then the size. • if you cannot increase the input image size, reduce the stride in the con-\nsequent layers, it has roughly the same effect. • if your network has a complex and highly optimized architecture, like e.g.\nGoogLeNet, be careful with modifications."

The sum of individual gains is bigger than the observed improvement when all modifications are introduced, but the ”deficit” is small suggesting independence of their benefits. We show that the use of 128x128 pixel images is sufficient to make qualitative conclusions about optimal network structure that hold for the full size Caffe and VGG nets. The results are obtained an order of magnitude faster than with the standard 224 pixel images.",
