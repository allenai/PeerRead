INTRODUCTION\nNatural Language Generation is a critical component in a Spoken Dialogue System (SDS), and its task is to convert a meaning representation produced by the dialogue manager into natural language utterances. Conventional approaches to NLG follow a pipeline. This typically breaks down the task into sentence planning and surface realization. Sentence planning decides the order and structure of sentence, which is followed by a surface realization which converts the sentence structure into the final utterance. Previous approaches to NLG still rely on extensive hand-tuning templates and rules that require expert knowledge of linguistic representation. There are some common and widely approaches to solve NLG problems, including rule-based [1], corpus-based n-gram models [2], and a trainable generator [3]. Joint based generators use a two-step pipeline [4], [5]; or applying a joint model for both tasks [6], [7].\nRecently, approaches based on recurrent neural networks have shown advantages in solving the NLG tasks. RNNbased models have been used for NLG as a joint training model [6], [7] and an end-to-end training model [8]. A recurring problem in such systems is requiring datasets annotated for specific dialogue acts1 (DA). Moreover, previous works may lack ability to handle cases such as the binary slots (i.e., yes and no) and slots that take don’t care value\n1A combination of an action type and a list of slot-value pairs. e.g. inform(name=‘Frances’; area=‘City Center’)\nwhich cannot be directly delexicalized [6], or to generalize to unseen domains [7]. Furthermore, a problem of the current generators is that the generators produce the next token based on the information from the forward context, whereas some sentences may depend on the backward context. As a result, the models tend to generate nonsensical utterances.\nWe propose a statistical NLG based on a gating mechanism on a GRU model, in which the gating mechanism is applied before RNN computation. The proposed model can learn from unaligned data by jointly training the sentence planning and surface realization to generate sentences. We found that the proposed model can produce sentences in a more correct oder than the existing models. The results showed that our proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of BLEU [9] and slot error rate ERR [7] scores. Overall, we make three contributions, in which we: (i) propose two semantic refinement based RNN models, in which a gating mechanism is applied before RNN computation to refine the original inputs, (ii) conduct extensively experiments on four NLG domains, and (iii) analyze the effectiveness of the proposed models on ability to handle the undelixicalized tokens, and to generalize to unseen domain with limited amount of in-domain data used."

      "heading" : "II. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Conventional approaches to NLG traditionally split the task into two subtasks: sentence planning and surface realization. Sentence planning deals with mapping of the input semantic symbols onto a linguistic structure, e.g., a tree-like or a template structure. The surface realization then converts the structure into an appropriate sentence [3]. Despite their success and wide use in solving NLG problems, these traditional methods still rely on the handcrafted rule-based generators or rerankers. [2] proposed a class-based n-gram language model (LM) generator which can learn to generate the sentences for a given DA and then select the best sentences using a rule-based reranker. [10] addressed some of the limitation of the class-based LMs by proposing a method based on a syntactic dependency tree. A phrase-\nbased generator based on factored LMs was introduced in [11], which can learn from a semantically aligned corpus.\nRecently, RNNs-based approaches have shown promising performance in the NLG domain. [12], [13] used RNNs in a multi-modal setting to generate captions for images. [14] also proposed a generator using RNNs to create Chinese poetry. [15] encoded an unstructured textual knowledge source along with previous responses and context to produce a response for technical support queries. For task-oriented dialogue systems, [6] combined a forward RNN generator, a CNN reranker, and a backward RNN reranker to generate utterances. A semantically conditioned-based Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) generator was proposed in [7], which introduced a control “reading” gate to the LSTM cell and can learn the gating mechanism and language model jointly. A recurring problem in such systems is the lack of sufficient domain-specific annotated data."

      "text" : "The recurrent language generator proposed in this paper is based on a RNN language model [16], which consists of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. The input to the network at each time step t is a 1- hot encoding wt of a token 2 wt which is conditioned on a recurrent hidden layer ht. The output layer yt represents the probability distribution of the next token given previous token wt and hidden ht. We can sample from this conditional distribution to obtain the next token in a generated string, and feed it as the next input to the generator. This process finishes when a stop sign is generated [12], or some constraint is reached [14]. The network can generate a sequence of tokens which can be lexicalized3 to form the required utterance. Moreover, in order to ensure that the generated utterance represents the intended meaning of the given DA, the generator is further conditioned on a vector z, a 1-hot vector representation of DA. Inspired by work in [17], we propose an intuition: Gating before computation, in which we add gating mechanism before the RNN computation to semantically refine the input tokens. The following sections present two proposed Semantic Refinement (SR) gating based RNN generators."

Here Wdz plays a role of sentence planning since it can directly capture which DA features are useful during the generation to encode the input information. The ⊙ element-wise multiplication plays a part in word-level matching which learns not only the vector similarity, but also preserve information about the two vectors. dt is called a refinement gate since the input tokens are refined by the DA information. As a result, we can represent the whole input sentence based on these refined inputs using RNN model.\nIn this study, we use GRU, which was recently proposed in [18], instead of LSTM as building computational block for RNN, which is formulated as follows:\nrt = σ(Wrxxt +Wrhht−1) (2)\nut = σ(Wuxxt +Wuhht−1) (3)\nh̃t = tanh(Whxxt + rt ⊙Whhht−1) (4)\nht = ut ⊙ ht−1 + (1− ut)⊙ h̃t (5)\nwhere: Wrx,Wrh,Wux,Wuh,Whx,Whh are weight matrices; rt, ut are reset and update gate, respectively, and ⊙ denotes for element-wise product. The Semantic Refinement GRU (SRGRU)-Base architecture is shown in Figure 1.\nFinally, the output distribution of each token is defined by\napplying a softmax function g as follows:\nP (wt+1 | wt, wt−1, ...w0, z) = g(Whoht) (6)\nwhere: Who is learned linear projection matrix.

      "heading" : "B. SRGRU-CONTEXT",
      "text" : "SRGRU-Base uses only the DA information to gate the input sequence token by token. As a results, this gating mechanism may not capture the relationship between multiple words. In order to import context information into the gating mechanism, the Equation 1 is modified as follows:\ndt = σ(Wdzz+Wdhht−1) xt = dt ⊙ wt (7)\nwhere: Wdz and Wdh are weight matrices. Wdh acts like a key phrase detector that learns to capture the pattern of generation tokens or the relationship between multiple tokens. In other words, the new input xt consists of information of the original input token wt, the dialogue act z, and the hidden context ht−1. dt is called the refinement gate because the input tokens are refined by a combination gating information of the dialogue act z and the previous hidden state ht−1. By taking advantage of gating mechanism from the LSTM model [19] in which the gating mechanism is employed to solve the gradient vanishing and exploding problem, we propose to apply the refinement gate deeper into the GRU cell. Firstly, the GRU reset and update gates can be further influenced on the given dialogue act z and the refined input xt. The Equations (2) and (3) are modified as follows:\nrt = σ(Wrxxt +Wrhht−1 +Wrzz) (8)\nut = σ(Wuxxt +Wuhht−1 +Wuzz) (9)\nwhere: Wrz and Wuz act like background detectors that learn to control the style of the generating sentence. Secondly, Equation (4) is modified so that the candidate activation h̃t also depends on the refinement gate,\nh̃t = tanh(Whxxt + rt ⊙Whhht−1)\n+ tanh(Wdcdt) (10)\nBy this way, the reset and update gates learn not only the long-term dependency but also the gating information from the dialogue act and the previous hidden state. We call the resulting architecture Semantic Refinement GRU (SRGRU)Context which is shown in Figure 1."

The Laptop and TV datasets have been released in [21] with about 13K distinct DAs in the Laptop and 7K distinct DAs in the TV. These two datasets have a much larger input space but only one training example for each DA so that the system must learn partial realization of concepts and be able to recombine and apply them to unseen DAs. The number of dialogue act types and slots of datasets is also larger than in Restaurant and Hotel datasets. As a result, the NLG tasks for the Laptop and TV datasets become much harder."

The hidden layer size was set to be 80, and the generators were trained with a 70% of dropout rate. We perform 5 runs with different random initialization of the network and the training is terminated by using early stopping as described in Section III-C. We select model that yields the highest\nBLEU score on the validation set. The decoder procedure used beam search with a beam width of 10. We set λ to 1000 to severely discourage the reranker from selecting utterances which contain either redundant or missing slots. For each DA, we over-generated 20 candidate utterances and selected the top 5 realizations after reranking. Because the proposed models work stochastically, except the results reported in Table I, all the results shown were averaged over 5 randomly initialized networks.\nSince some sentences may depend on both the past and the future during generation, we train another backward SRGRU-Context to utilizing the flexibility of the refinement gate dt, in which we tie its weight matrices such Wdz and Wdh (Equation 7) for both. We found that by tying matrix Wdz for both forward and backward RNNs, the proposed generator seems to produce more correct and grammatical utterances than those having the only forward RNN. This model called Tying Backward SRGRU-Context (TB-SRGRU).\nIn order to better understand the effectiveness of our proposed model, we conduct more experiments to compare the SRGRU-Context with the state-of-the-art SCLSTM in a variety of setups on proportion of training corpus, beam size, and top-k best results. Firstly, the Restaurant and TV datasets were chosen, in which the SCLSTM model obtained the best performances and the NLG task comes from a limited domain to a more diverse domain as described in Section IV-A. In this setup, the models were run with different size of training corpus. Secondly, we examined the stability of SRGRU-Context model on different setups of beam size and top-k best results."

Both metrics were computed by adopting code from an open source benchmark toolkit for Natural Language Generation3.\nWe compared our proposed models against with the general GRU (GRU-Base) and three strong baselines released from the NLG toolkit:\n• ENCDEC proposed in [23] which applies the attention\nmechanism to an RNN encoder-decoder.\n• HLSTM proposed in [6] which uses a heuristic gate to\nensure that all of the attribute-value information was accurately captured when generating. • SCLSTM proposed in [7] which can learn the gating\nsignal and language model jointly."

      "heading" : "V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS",
      "text" : "Overall, the proposed models SRGRUs consistently achieve better performance in term of the BLEU score in all domains. Especially, on the Hotel and TV datasets, the proposed models outperform the previous methods in both evaluation metrics. Moreover, our models also outperform the GRU basic model (GRU-Base) in all cases. However, the proposed models get worse on the Restaurant and Hotel datasets in terms of the error rate ERR score in comparison with SCLSTM. This indicates the advantage of the proposed\n3https://github.com/shawnwun/RNNLG\nrefinement gate. A comparison of the two proposed generators is shown in Table II: Without the backward RNN reranker, the generator tends to make semantic errors since it gains the higher slot error rate ERR. However, using the backward SRGRU reranker can improve the results in both evaluation metrics. This reranker provides benefit to the generator on producing higher-quality utterances.\nFigure 2 compares two generators trained with different proportion of data evaluated on two metrics. As can be seen in Figure 2a, the SCLSTM model achieves better results than SRGRU-Context model on both of BLEU and ERR scores since a small amount of training data was provided. However, the SRGRU-Context obtains the higher BLEU score and slightly higher ERR score as more training data was fed. On the other hand, in a more diverse dataset TV, the SRGRU-Context model consistently outperforms the SCLSTM on both evaluation metrics no matter how much training data is (Figure 2b). This is mainly due to the ability of refinement gate which feeds to the GRU model a new input xt conveying useful information filtered from the original input and the gating mechanism. Moreover, this gate also keeps the pattern of the generated utterance during generation. As a result, it can have a better realization of unseen slot-value pairs. Figure 3a shows an effect of beam\nsize on the SRGRU-Context model evaluated on Restaurant and TV datasets. As can be seen that, the model performs worse in terms of degrading the BLEU score and upgrading the slot error rate ERR when the beam size increases. The model seems to perform best with beam size less than 100. Figure 3b presents an effect of top-k best results in which we fixed the beam size at 100 and top-k best results varied as k = 1, 5, 10 and 20. In each case, the BLEU and the error rate ERR scores were computed on Restaurant and TV datasets. The results are consistent with Figure 3a in which the BLEU and ERR scores get worse as more top-k best utterances were chosen. Table III shows comparison of top responses generated by different models for given DAs. Firstly, both models SCLSTM and SRGRU-Context seem to produce the same kind of error, for example, grammar mistakes or missing information, partly because of using the same idea about gating mechanism. However, TB-SRGRU, with tying the refinement gate, has ability to fix this problem and produce the correct utterances (row 1 of Table III). Secondly, as noted earlier, one problem of the previous methods is the ability to handle the binary slot and slots that take don’t care value. Both SCLSTM and the proposed models are able to handle this problem (row 2 of Table III). Finally, the TV dataset is more diverse and much\nharder than the others because the order of slot-value pairs should be considered during generation. For example, to generate a comparison sentence of 2 items Triton 52 and Hades 76 for given dialogue act compare(name=Triton 52; ecorating=A+; family=L7; name=Hades 76; ecorating=C; family=L9), the generator should consider that A+ and L7 values belong to the former item while C and L9 values to the latter. The HLSTM tends to make the repeated information error while the ENCDEC and SCLSTM seem to misplace the slot value during generation. Take L7 value, for instance, which should be generated follow the Triton 52 instead of Hades 76 as in row 3 of Table III. We found that both proposed models SRGRU-Context and TB-SRGRU can deal with this problem to generate appropriate utterances."

This paper presents a new approach to NLG by using recurrent neural networks (RNN), in which a gating mechanism is applied before RNN computation. This allows the proposed model to generate appropriate sentences. The RNN-based generator can be learned from unaligned data by jointly training sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language responses. The model was extensively evaluated on four different NLG domains. The results show that the proposed generator achieved better performance on all the NLG domains compared to previous generators.",
