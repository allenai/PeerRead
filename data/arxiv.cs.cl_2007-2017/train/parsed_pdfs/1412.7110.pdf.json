      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "State-of-the-art Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically divide the task into several sub-tasks, which are optimized in an independent manner (Bourlard & Morgan, 1994). In a first step, the data is transformed into features, usually composed of a dimensionality reduction phase and an information selection phase, based on the task-specific knowledge of the phenomena. These two phases have been carefully hand-crafted, leading to state-of-the-art features such as mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) or perceptual linear prediction cepstral features (PLPs). In a second step, the likelihood of subword units such as, phonemes is estimated using generative models or discriminative models. In a final step, dynamic programming techniques are used to recognize the word sequence given the lexical and syntactical constraints.\nRecently, in the HMM/ANN framework, there has been growing interests in using “intermediate” representations, like short-term spectrum, instead of conventional features, such as cepstral-based features. Representations such as Mel filterbank output or log spectrum have been proposed in the context of deep neural networks (Hinton et al., 2012). In our recent study (Palaz et al., 2013), it was shown that it is possible to estimate phoneme class conditional probabilities by using temporal raw speech signal as input to convolutional neural networks (LeCun, 1989) (CNNs). This system yielded similar or better results on TIMIT phoneme recognition task with standard hybrid HMM/ANN systems. We also showed that this system is scalable to large vocabulary speech recognition task (Palaz et al., 2014). In this case, the CNN-based system was able to outperform HMM/ANN system with less parameters.\nIn this paper, we investigate the features learning capability of the CNN based system with simple classifiers. More specifically, we replace the classification stage of the CNN based system, which was a non-linear multi-layer perceptron, by a linear single layer perceptron. Thus, the features\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n71 10\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 2\nlearned by the CNNs are trained to be linearly separable. We evaluate the proposed approach on phoneme recognition task on the TIMIT corpus and on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition on the WSJ corpus. We compare our approach with conventional HMM/ANN system using cepstral-based features. Our studies show that the CNN-based system using a linear classifier yields similar or better performance than the ANN-based approach using MFCC features, with much less parameters.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the motivation of this work. Section 3 presents the architecture of the proposed system. Section 4 presents the experimental setup and Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 and 7 presents the discussion and concludes the paper."

      "heading" : "2 MOTIVATION",
      "text" : "In speech recognition, designing relevant features is not a trivial task, due to the fact that the speech signal is non-stationary and non-linear. Inspired by speech coding studies, spectral-based features have been shown to yield state-of-the-art performance. The two most common ones are Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP). These features are both based on obtaining a good representation of the short-term power spectrum. They are computed following a series of steps, as presented in Figure 1(a). The extraction process consists of (1) transforming the temporal data in the frequency domain, (2) filtering the spectrum based on critical bands analysis, which is derived from speech perception knowledge, (3) applying a non-linear operation and (4) applying a transformation. This process only models the signal locally, on a narrow time window. To model the temporal variation intrinsic to the speech signal, dynamic features are computed by taking the first and second derivative of the static features on the longer time window, and concatenate them together. These resulting features are then fed to the acoustic modeling part of the speech recognition system, which can be based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) or artificial neural networks (ANN).\nIn recent years, the deep neural network (DNN) and deep belief network (DBN) approaches have been proposed (Hinton et al., 2006), which yielded state-of-the-art results in speech recognition using neural networks composed of many hidden layers, initialized in an unsupervised manner. While this original work still relies on MFCC features, several approaches proposed to use ‘intermediate” representations (standing between raw signal and “classical” features such as cepstral-based features) as input. In other words, they proposed to discard several operation in the extraction pipeline of the conventional features (see Figure 1(b)). For\ninstance, Mel filterbank energies were used as input of convolutional neural networks based systems (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2012; Sainath et al., 2013). Deep neural network based systems using spectrum as input has also been proposed (Mohamed et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2009). Combination of different features has also been investigated (Bocchieri & Dimitriadis, 2013). Extracting features from raw speech has also been investigated using DBNs (Jaitly & Hinton, 2011; Tüske et al., 2014). All these approaches still rely on the dynamic features extraction and concatenation approach to model the temporal variations of the signal. Also, the features are extracted independently from the acoustic model, in a knowledge-driven manner. Thus, most of the system’s capacity lies on the classification part.\nIn our recent studies (Palaz et al., 2013; 2014), it was shown that it is possible to estimate phoneme class conditional probabilities by using temporal raw speech signal as input to convolutional neural networks (see Figure 1(c)). This system is composed of several filter stages, which perform the features learning step and which is implemented by convolution and max-pooling layers, and of a classification stage, implemented by a multi-layer perceptron. Both stages are trained jointly. On phoneme recognition and on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task, we showed that the system is able to learn features from the raw speech signal, and yields performance similar or better than conventional ANN based system that takes cepstral features as input. The proposed system needs less parameters to yield similar performance with conventional systems, suggesting that the learned features are somehow more efficient.\nMotivated by these studies, the goal of the present paper is ascertain the capability of the convolutional neural network based system to learn linearly separable features in a data-driven manner. To this aim, we replace the classifier stage of the CNN-based system, which was a non-linear multilayer perceptron, by a linear single layer perceptron. Our objective is not to show that the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance, but to show that learning features in a data-driven manner can lead to features as efficient as conventional features. Moreover, learning them jointly with the classifier can lead to system where most of the capacity lies on the features learning part rather than on the classification part."

We train the CNN based system with several filter stages (composed of convolution and max-pooling layers). We use between one and five filter stages. In the case of linear classifier, the capacity of the system cannot by tuned directly. It depends on the size of the input of the classifier, which can be adjusted by manually tuned the hyper-parameters. We thus proposed two approaches to select the hyper-parameters. In the first one, they were tuned by early-stopping on the validation set. Ranges which were considered for the grid search are reported in Table 2. For the second approach, we tuned them in order to have the same number of output for the filters stages as in the baseline system. Thus, the classifier has exactly the same number of parameters, so a fair comparison can be done.\nUsing 2 filter stages, the best performance was found with: 310 ms of context, 30 samples width for the first convolution, 7 frames kernel width for the second convolution, 80 and 60 filters and 3 pooling width. Using 3 filter stages, the best performance was found with: 310 ms of context, 30\nsamples width for the first convolution, 7 and 7 frames kernel width for the other convolutions, 80, 60 and 60 filters and 3 pooling width.

The number of parameters in the classifier and in the filters stages are also presented. Using a linear classifier, the proposed SLP based system outperforms the MLP based baseline with three or more filters stage. One can notice that the performance of the proposed system seems to increase when most of the parameters lies in the filter stages rather than in the classification stage. Also, our SLP based system can almost reach the performance of the MLP based CNN system, with 60 times less parameters in the classifier. The results for the proposed system with a fixed number of output in presented in Table 4, along with the baseline performance and the number of the parameters in the classifier and filter stages. The proposed CNN based system outperforms the SLP based baseline with the same number of parameters in the classifier. Fixing the output size seems to degrade the performance compared to Table 3. A possible explanation is that fixing the output leads to a sub-optimal set of hyperparameters for the network.\nThe results for the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition task on the WSJ corpus is presented in Table 5 for the best performance. One can observed a similar trend to the TIMIT results, showing that the SLP-based CNN system is scalable to large database."

      "heading" : "6.1 JOINT TRAINING",
      "text" : "Traditionally in speech recognition system, features extraction and acoustic modeling are separate processes. Features extraction is usually driven by knowledge, and the acoustic model is trained on the data. In the proposed approach, the features learning and acoustic modeling steps are trained jointly, in a completely data-driven manner. Such approach thus allows the features to be flexible, as they will be learned to be efficient with a given classifier. In the presented studies, we show that it is possible to learn linearly separable features and that using such features can yield similar or better results than baseline system. In this case, the capacity of the system mostly lies on the features learning stage rather than on the classification stage.\nOne potential application in speech recognition for such system using a simple classifier is language adaptation. Indeed, training a classifier on a language with low resources can be a difficult task, mainly for training the acoustic model. The usual approach is to train the classifier on a language with a lot of resources, such as English, and use it as an initialization point for the new language. In our system, the linear classifier can be very quickly adapted. Moreover, having an overall low number of parameters also helps."
    }, {
      "heading" : "6.2 FEATURE LEARNING",
      "text" : "In the proposed approach, the features are learned by convolutional neural networks. The whole architecture is designed empirically, i.e. by early-stopping on the validation set. We realize that one the most important hyper-parameter is the kernel width of the first convolution, which takes a window of the temporal speech signal as input. We find that the best performance is obtained with a very narrow kernel, around 30 samples or 3 ms. In the case of conventional spectral-based features, as presented in Section 2, the temporal window width is around 30 ms. This width was\nselected based on speech production knowledge, whereas in our case, the kernel width was found in a data-driven manner.\nIn our previous studies, we showed that the first convolution layer can be seen as a set of matching filters, each one responding to different frequency bands (Palaz et al., 2013). We later showed that these filters show some level of invariance across databases (Palaz et al., 2014). In the convolutional neural network framework, Swietojanski et al. (2014) used for instance Mel filterbank as input for the convolution and maxpooling layers. In other words, the temporal speech signal is first filtered by a hand-crafted filterbank and then fed to the CNNs. It is similar to the proposed approach, except that, in our case, the filters are learned in a data-driven manner.\nIn the proposed architecture, the representation obtained by using these filters is then processed through a max-pooling layer, which increases the temporal window this representation has access to, and brings some level of robustness. The next layers of the network combine these representations along time. For each additional layer, the temporal window length of the representation increases, until the last layer, where the outputs of the filter stage have access to the whole context window. Overall, this explanation suggests that in our architecture, the short-term representation is modeled by the first convolution, and the long-term temporal variations are modeled by the following convolution layers."

These results indicated that CNNs are able to learn linearly separable features in a data-driven manner, and that these features can be as efficient as spectral-based features. Moreover, we show that using such approach can lead to systems where most of the capacity lies on the features learning part instead of the classification part, which can be very simple. As future work, we plan to investigate using other types of classifiers, such as linear SVM, and investigate language adaptation."

These features are extracted based on prior knowledge such as, speech perception or/and speech production. Recently, convolutional neural networks have been shown to be able to estimate phoneme conditional probabilities in a completely data-driven manner, i.e. using directly temporal raw speech signal as input. This system was shown to yield similar or better performance than HMM/ANN based system on phoneme recognition task and on large scale continuous speech recognition task, using less parameters. Motivated by these studies, we investigate the use of simple linear classifier in the CNN-based framework. Thus, the network learns linearly separable features from raw speech. We show that such system yields similar or better performance than MLP based system using cepstral-based features as input.",
