In this article, we describe a new approach of a practical application of fuzzy logic techniques to the construction of learning hierarchies. For this, we use a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts of a specific field. However, the relationships of prerequisites between the skills in the learning hierarchy are not definitive and they are fuzzy relationships. Indeed, we measure relevance degree of all relationships existing in this learning hierarchy and we try to answer to the following question: Is the relationships of prerequisites predefined in initial learning hierarchy are correctly established or not? Keywords: Learning hierarchy, Fuzzy Sets Theory, Fuzzy relationships, Data mining\nI. INTRODUCTION In 1968 Gagne defined the construction of learning hierarchies for programmed instruction (Gagne, 1968; Skinner, 1986; Molenda, 2008) purposes, and in particular, for Branching or Intrinsic Programming (Crowder, 1962; Roe, 1962; Molenda, 2008) which is directly related to a particular view of cognition and learning called behaviorism (Ertmer & Newby, 1993; Greeno, Collins & Resnick, 1996).\nRobert Gagne (1968) defined a learning hierarchy as a set of specified intellectual capabilities or intellectual skills. The capabilities in the hierarchy have an ordered relationship to each other and the hierarchy, as a whole, bears some relation to a plan for effective instruction. The hierarchy is built in a manner to reflect that a lower level skill must be acquired or mastered before an upper-level one, that is, lower level capabilities are prerequisites for upper level ones. Intellectual capabilities or skills are the nodes of the hierarchy. Gagne (1968) defines them as cognitive strategies that denote capabilities for action. Additionally, they also depict a learning route, a path, from simple skills to a final complex capability.\nLearning hierarchies not only serve to represent effective instruction plans in terms of skills or capabilities, but also, they serve as diagnosis instruments for providing individual or personalized remediation to students. However, for classrooms with a large number of students, the application of learning hierarchies for individualized (remedial) instruction is a highly time consuming task. Learning hierarchies belong to the behaviorist view on cognition and\nlearning (Ertmer & Newby, 1993; Greeno, Collins & Resnick, 1996), which is a perspective that had, as goals, to make the teaching-learning process more effective and customized to individual differences, in order to improve students' performance on test situations (Molenda, 2008). The following section presents an overview of some existing approaches for learning hierarchy and discusses their limits.\nII. OVERVIEW OF SOME EXISTING APPROACHES FOR LEARNING HIERARCHY"

      "text" : "One approach to apply learning hierarchy in real educational settings is to arrange the content in small steps, or frames of information. These steps lead the learner from the simple to the complex in a carefully ordered sequence, and, most important, at each step the learner is required to make a response, that is, to write or select an answer. This is called programmed instruction (Skinner, 1986; Molenda, 2008) and in its simplest form, which is called linear programming, it represents a linear graph formed by a set of frames, where every frame to the left is a prerequisite for the frames on the right.\nHowever, this view to programmed instruction had and important flaw: all students, regardless of their aptitudes or their prior knowledge of the subject matter, had to go through the same frames and no remedial steps where included."

      "heading" : "2. Approach by Branching Programming",
      "text" : "The development of Branching or Intrinsic Programming is a technique allowed learners to skip\nwww.ijera.com 59|P a g e\nahead through material that was easy for them or to branch off to remedial frames when they had difficulty (Crowder, 1962; Roe, 1962; Molenda, 2008). The ultimate goal of branching programming is to take care of the individual differences of students, in terms of prior knowledge of the subject matter and other abilities that the learner brings (Roe, 1962), and provide personalized paths of learning.\nIt has to be stated that just as with linear programming, the frames in branching programming, including the remedial ones, had to be designed a priori. This proved to be a very difficult task and led to the design of very complex branching programming graphs and procedures such as: backward branching to missed items, backward branching to review an entire sequence of items, backward branching to alternate form items, lateral branching to supplemental or prerequisite material, lateral branching to supplemental practice items, branching down to a lower level or more detailed items for slow students, branching up to a faster program for bright students, and finally, forward branching by skipping items (Roe, 1962). The complexity of the graphs makes this approach very difficult its practical application."

      "text" : "Several learning systems build their learning hierarchies by using a number of different methods of fuzzy logic (Al-Sarem et al, 2010 and Chu et al., 2010 and Chen and Bai, 2008). Sue et al., 2010, used a two-phase method that extracts the association rules between the skills by applying fuzzy logic to convert the grades learners into three levels of difficulty and construct a learning hierarchy. Bai and Chen, 2010, simplified and improved the latter method in adaptive way. These methods considered grades obtained by learners during the process learning is a fuzzy notion. However, they don’t take into account the possibility of using a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts of a specific field.\nBefore introducing our approach, the following section describes some concepts of fuzzy logic which we use later in this paper."

      "text" : "Since 1965, the Fuzzy Sets Theory has advanced in a variety of ways and in many disciplines. Fuzzy sets were introduced by Zadeh to represent mathematically the vagueness on certain classes of objects and provide the basis for fuzzy logic.\nThe fuzzy sets were introduced to model human knowledge representation, and thus improve the performance of systems that use this modelling decision. Fuzzy sets admit gradation such as all tones between black and white. A fuzzy set has a graphical\ndescription that expresses how the transition from one to another takes place. This graphical description is called a membership function. A fuzzy part (or fuzzy set) of a set E is an application µA(x): E  [0, 1]:"

For this, we use a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts of a specific field. However, the relationships of prerequisites between the skills in the learning hierarchy are not definitive and they are fuzzy relationships. Indeed, we try -with using fuzzy logic- to answer to the following question: Is the relationships of prerequisites predefined in initial learning hierarchy are correctly established or not?\nTo respond to this question, we follow the following phases: The first phase determines an initial predefined learning hierarchy, the second phase measure the variation of grades of learners, the next phase transformed the data by using the fuzzification technique, then the next phase mine the association rules between the skills. In the last two phases we propose to build the final learning hierarchy."

The capabilities in the hierarchy have an ordered relationship to each other and the hierarchy, as a whole, bears some relation to a plan for effective instruction. The hierarchy is built in a manner to reflect that a lower level skill must be acquired or mastered before an upper-level one, that is, lower level capabilities are prerequisites for upper level ones. Intellectual capabilities or skills are the nodes of the hierarchy.\nAt the end we will have an initial learning hierarchy as shown in figure below:\nThe Figure 2 shows an example of a learning hierarchy of a course containing 10 relevant skills, and prerequisite relationships among them. From the links of the learning hierarchy we define the matrix M of prerequisites between skills, where the value of each element Mij is calculated as below: Mij = 1 means the skill « i » is a prerequisite of the skill « j ». Mij = 0 means the skill « i » is not a prerequisite of the skill « j ». « i » represents the rows and « j » the columns.\nTable 1 below, shows a matrix representation (Mij) of initial predefined learning hierarchy of the figure 2.\nFor example, the first line means that the skill A is a prerequisite of the skills B and C."

      "text" : "In this paper we present a new hybrid approach to construct the learning hierarchy of a specific field, this approach is based on using a predefined expert learning hierarchy and we measure the degree of relevance of all relationships existing in this predefined expert learning hierarchy. This new approach improves the educational protocol to obtain two kinds of prerequisite relationships, the first type can be classified as relationships correctly established by the expert. These relationships must be kept in the final learning hierarchy. The second type can be considered as relations incorrectly established by the expert, these relations must be deleted or substituted with the inverse of the original relationships. For the second type we conclude that there is no correlation between the results obtained and the skills of learners, which can be explained by one or both of the following reasons:\n The use of inappropriate items in the tests of the two skills\n The two skills of this relationship are completely independent. The results obtained from the application of this new approach on the course of JAVA programming language are good.\nREFERENCES [1] Aajli and Afdel, “A computer adaptive\nassessment system for E-Learning and ERecruitment based on a new measuring skills approach International”, Journal of Educational Technology Letters Volume 3, Number 1, June, 2013 P. 42-51, Online: http://www.ier-\ninstitute.org/2163‐4246.html [2] Alkhazaleh and Salleh, “Fuzzy Soft Multiset\nTheory, Abstract and Applied Analysis”, 2012, article ID 350600, 20 p.

    "abstractText" : "In recent years, adaptive learning systems rely increasingly on learning hierarchy to customize the educational logic developed in their courses. Most approaches do not consider that the relationships of prerequisites between the skills are fuzzy relationships. In this article, we describe a new approach of a practical application of fuzzy logic techniques to the construction of learning hierarchies. For this, we use a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts of a specific field. However, the relationships of prerequisites between the skills in the learning hierarchy are not definitive and they are fuzzy relationships. Indeed, we measure relevance degree of all relationships existing in this learning hierarchy and we try to answer to the following question: Is the relationships of prerequisites predefined in initial learning hierarchy are correctly established or not?",
