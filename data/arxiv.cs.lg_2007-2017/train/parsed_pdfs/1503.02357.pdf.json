The specifically designed convolutional architecture encodes not only the semantic similarity of the translation pair, but also the context containing the phrase in the source language. Therefore, our approach is able to capture context-dependent semantic similarities of translation pairs. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy to train the model: we classify the training examples into easy, medium, and difficult categories, and gradually build the ability of representing phrase and sentence level context by using training examples from easy to difficult. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system by up to 1.4 BLEU points."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "In a conventional statistical machine translation (SMT) system, the translation model is constructed in two steps (Koehn et al. 2003). First, bilingual phrase pairs respecting to the word alignments are extracted from a word-aligned parallel corpus. Second, the phrase pairs are assigned with scores calculated using their relative frequencies in the same corpus. However, only finding and utilizing translation pairs based on their surface forms is not sufficient: the conventional approach often fails to capture translation pairs which are grammatically and semantically similar.\nTo alleviate the above problems, several researchers have proposed learning and utilizing semantically similar translation pairs in a continuous space (Gao et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014; Cho et al. 2014b). The core idea is that the two phrases in a translation pair should share the same semantic meaning and have similar (close) feature vectors in the continuous space. A matching score is computed by measuring the distance between the feature vectors of the phrases, and is incorporated into the SMT system as an additional feature.\nThe above methods, however, neglect the information of local contexts, which has been proven to be useful for disambiguating translation candidates during decoding (He et al. 2008; Marton and Resnik 2008). The matching scores of translation pairs are treated the same, even they are in different contexts. Accordingly, the methods fail to adapt to local contexts and lead to precision issues for specific sentences in different contexts.\n∗ Units 525-530, Core Building 2, Hong Kong Science Park, Shatin, Hong Kong.

For each phrase pair, we use the sentence containing the phrase in source language as the context. With the convolutional neural network, we summarize the information of a phrase pair and its context, and further compute the pair’s matching score with a multi-layer perceptron.\nWe discriminately train the model using a curriculum learning strategy. We classify the training examples (i.e. triples (source phrase with its context, positive candidate, negative candidate)) according to the difficulty level of distinguishing the positive candidate (i.e. correct translation for the source phrase in the specific context) from the negative candidate (i.e. a bad translation in this context). Then we train the model to learn the semantic information from easy (basic semantic similarities between phrase pairs) to difficult (context-dependent semantic similarities).\nExperimental results on a large-scale translation task show that the context-dependent convolutional matching (CDCM) model improves the performance by up to 1.4 BLEU points over a strong phrase-based SMT system. Moreover, the CDCM model significantly outperforms its context-independent counterpart, proving that it is necessary to incorporate local contexts into SMT. Contributions. Our key contributions include:\n• we introduce a novel CDCM model to capture context-dependent semantic similarities between phrase pairs (Section 3);\n• we develop a novel learning algorithm to train the CDCM model using a curriculum learning strategy (Section 4)."

      "text" : "Our research builds on previous work in the field of context-dependent rule matching and bilingual phrase representations.\nThere is a line of work that employs local contexts over discrete representations of words or phrases. For example, He et al. (2008), Liu et al. (2008) and Marton and Resnik (2008) employed within-sentence contexts that consist of discrete words to guide rule matching. However, these discrete context features usually suffer the data sparseness problem. In addition, these models treated each word as a distinct feature, which can not leverage the semantic similarity between words as our model. Wu et al. (2014) exploited discrete contextual features in the source sentence (e.g. words and part-of-speech tags) to learn better bilingual word embeddings for SMT. However, they only focused on frequent phrase pairs and induced phrasal similarities by simply summing up the matching scores of all the embraced words. In this study, we take into account all the phrase pairs and directly compute phrasal similarities with convolutional representations of the local contexts, integrating the strengths associated with the convolutional neural networks (Collobert and Weston 2008).\nAnother line of work focuses on capturing the document-level contexts via distributed representations. For instance, Xiao et al. (2012) and Cui et al. (2014) incorporated documentlevel topic information to select more semantically matched rules. Although many sentences share the same topic with the document where they occur, there are a lot of sentences actually do have topics different from those of their documents (Xiong and Zhang 2013). While these general contexts over the whole document may be not precise enough for the specific sentences in contexts different from the document, our approach is capable of learning the representations for different sentences respectively. Moreover, they learned distributed representations for documents rather than phrases and derived distributed phrase representations from the corresponding\nZhaopeng Tu Context-Dependent Translation Selection Using Convolutional Neural Network\ndocuments, while we attempt to build and train a single, large neural network that reads phrase pairs with contexts and outputs the match degrees directly.\nIn recent years, there has also been growing interest in bilingual phrase representations that group phrases with a similar meaning across different languages. Based on that translation equivalents share the same semantic meaning, they can supervise each other to learn their semantic phrase embeddings in a continuous space. For example, Gao et al. (2014) projected phrases from both source and target sides into a common, continuous space that is language independent. Although Zhang et al. (2014) did not enforce the phrase embeddings from both sides to be in the same continuous space, they exploited a transformation between the two semantic embedding spaces. However, these models focused on capturing semantic similarities between phrase pairs in the global contexts, and neglected the local contexts, thus ignored the useful discriminative information. Alternatively, we integrate the local contexts into our convolutional matching architecture to obtain context-dependent semantic similarities. Meng et al. (2015) and Zhang (2015) have proposed independently to summary source sentences with convolutional neural networks. However, they both extend the neural network joint model (NNJM) of Devlin et al. (2014) to include the whole source sentence, while we focus on capturing context-dependent semantic similarities of translation pairs."

      "text" : "The model architecture, shown in Figure 1, is a variant of the convolutional architecture of Hu et al. (2014). It consists of two components:\n• convolutional sentence model that summarizes the meaning of the source sentence and the target phrase;\n• matching model that compares the two representations with a multi-layer perceptron (Bengio 2009).\nLet ê be a target phrase and f be the source sentence that contains the source phrase aligning to ê. We first project f and ê into feature vectors x and y via the convolutional sentence model, and then compute the matching score s(x,y) by the matching model. Finally, the score is introduced into a conventional SMT system as an additional feature. Convolutional sentence model. As shown in Figure 1, the model takes as input the embeddings of words (trained beforehand elsewhere) in f and ê. It then iteratively summarizes the meaning of the input through layers of convolution and pooling, until reaching a fixed length vectorial representation in the final layer.\nIn Layer-1, the convolution layer takes sliding windows on f and ê respectively, and models all the possible compositions of neighbouring words. The convolution involves a filter to produce a new feature for each possible composition. Given a k-sized sliding window i on f or ê, for example, the jth convolution unit of the composition of the words is generated by:\nci (1,j) = g(ĉi (0)) · φ(w(1,j) · ĉi(0) + b(1,j)) (1)\nwhere\n• g(·) is the gate function that determines whether to activate φ(·);\n• φ(·) is a non-linear activation function. In this work, we use ReLu (Dahl et al. 2013) as the activation function;\n• w(1,j) is the parameters for the jth convolution unit on Layer-1, with matrix W(1) = [w(1,1), . . . ,w(1,J)];\n• ĉi(0) is a vector constructed by concatenating word vectors in the k-sized sliding widow i;\n• b(1,j) is a bias term, with vector B(1) = [b(1,1), . . . ,b(1,J)].\nTo distinguish the phrase pair from its context, we use one additional dimension in word embeddings: 1 for words in the phrase pair and 0 for the others. After transforming words to their tagged embeddings, the convolutional sentence model takes multiple choices of composition using sliding windows in the convolution layer. Note that sliding windows are allowed to cross the boundary of the source phrase to exploit both phrasal and contextual information.\nIn order to avoid the length variability of source sentences and target phrases, we add allzero paddings at the end of the source sentence and target phrase until their maximum length. Moreover, we use the gate function g(·) to eliminate the effect of the all-zero padding by setting output vector to all-zeros if the input is all-zeros.\nIn Layer-2, we apply a local max-pooling in non-overlapping 1× 2 windows for every convolution unit\nc (2,j) i = max{c (1,j) 2i , c (1,j) 2i+1} (2)\nIn Layer-3, we perform convolution on output from Layer-2:\nci (3,j) = g(ĉi (2)) · φ(w(3,j) · ĉi(2) + b(3,j)) (3)\nZhaopeng Tu Context-Dependent Translation Selection Using Convolutional Neural Network\nAfter more convolution and max-pooling operations, we obtain two feature vectors for the source sentence and the target phrase, respectively. Matching model. The matching score of a source sentence and a target phrase can be measured as the similarity between their feature vectors. Specifically, we use the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), a nonlinear function for similarity, to compute their matching score. First we use one layer to combine their feature vectors to get a hidden state hc.\nhc = φ(wc · [xf̄i : yēj ] + bc) (4)\nThen we get the matching score from the MLP:\ns(x,y) = MLP (hc) (5)"

To this end, we employ a discriminative training strategy with a max-margin objective.\nSuppose we are given the following triples (x,y+,y−) from the oracle, where x,y+,y− are the feature vectors for f , ê+, ê− respectively. We have the ranking-based loss as objective:\nLΘ(x,y +,y−) = max(0, 1 + s(x,y−)− s(x,y+)) (6)\nwhere s(x,y) is the matching score function defined in Eq. 5, Θ consists of parameters for both the convolutional sentence model and MLP. The model is trained by minimizing the above objective, to encourage the model to assign higher matching scores to positive examples and to assign lower scores to negative examples. We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the model parameters Θ.\nNote that the CDCM model aims at capturing contextual representations that can distinguish good translation candidates from bad ones in various contexts. To this end, we propose a twostep approach. First, we initialize the model with context-dependent bilingual word embeddings to start with strong contextual and semantic equivalence at the word level (Section 4.1). Second, we train the CDCM model with a curriculum strategy to learn the context-dependent semantic similarity at the phrase level from easy (basic semantic similarities between the source and target phrase pair) to difficult (context-dependent semantic similarities for the same source phrase in varying contexts) (Section 4.2)."

Given an aligned word pair (fi, ej), the context is extracted from the nearby window on each side (the left two words and the right two words in this work). Let f̄i = fi−2, fi−1, fi, fi+1, fi+2 and ēj = ej−2, ej−1, ej , ej+1, ej+2 be the contextual sequence for the above word pair. We get their vectorial representations by:\nxf̄i = φ(wf · Le(f̄i) + bf ) (7)\nyēj = φ(we · Le(ēj) + be) (8)\nwhere Le(·) converts word sequences into embeddings and returns a vector by concatenating the embeddings.\nSimilarly, we calculate matching score for xf̄i and yēj according to Eq. 4 and Eq. 5. The bilingual word embedding model is also trained by minimizing the objective in Eq. 6. The negative examples are constructed by replacing either fi or ej with words randomly chosen from the corresponding vocabulary."

Each unique phrase pair serves as a positive example and a randomly selected target phrase from the phrase table is the corresponding negative example. The matching score is also introduced into Baseline as an additional feature.\nTable 1 summaries the results of CDCMs trained from different curriculums. No matter from which curriculum it is trained, the CDCM model significantly improves the translation quality on the overall test data (with gains of 1.0 BLEU points).

This indicates that the CDCM model indeed captures the desirable semantic information by the curriculum learning from easy to difficult.\nComparing with its context-independent counterpart (CICM, Row 2), the CDCM model shows significant improvement on all the test data consistently. We contribute this to the incorporation of useful discriminative information embedded in the local context. In addition, the performance of CICM is comparable with that of CDCM1. This is intuitive, because both of them try to capture the basic semantic similarity between the source and target phrase pair. Qualitative Analysis. Figure 3 lists some interesting cases to show why the CDCM model improves the performance. We analyze the phrase pair scores computed by the CDCM model against the phrase translation probabilities from the translation model. First, the CDCM model scores phrase pairs based rather on the semantic similarity and the contextual information than on their co-occurrences in the corpus. Therefore, it is complementary to the translation model. Second, with the growing of curriculum, our model is more likely to capture the contextdependent semantic similarities between phrase pairs. In most cases, the choices of translation candidates by the fully trained CDCM model (i.e. CDCM3) are closer to actual translations for both frequent and less frequent phrases. Third, though the CICM model captures the semantic similarities between phrase pairs, it fails to adapt to different local contexts as well. In contrast, the CDCM model is able to provide different translation candidates based on the discriminative information embedded in the local contexts."

Previous works on bilingual phrase representations usually employ Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (Cho et al. 2014b) or Recursive AutoEncoder (RAE) (Zhang et al. 2014). It has been observed in (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom 2013; Sutskever et al. 2014; Cho et al. 2014a) that the recursive approaches suffer from a significant drop in translation quality when translating long sentences. In contrast, Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) show that the convolutional model could represent the semantic content of a long sentence accurately. Therefore, we choose the convolutional architecture to model the meaning of sentence. Limitations. Unlike recursive models, the convolutional architecture has a fixed depth, which bounds the level of composition. In this task, this limitation can be largely compensated with a network afterwards that can take a “global” synthesis on the learned sentence representation.\nOne of the hypotheses we tested in the course of this research was disproved. We thought it likely that the difficult curriculum (i.e. distinguish the correct translation from other candidates for a given context) would contribute most to the improvement, since this circumstance is more consistent with the real decoding procedure. This turned out to be false, as shown in Table 1. One possible reason is that the “negative” examples (other candidates for the same source phrase) may share the same semantic meaning with the positive one, thus give a wrong guide in the supervised training. Constructing a reasonable set of negative examples that are more semantically different from the positive one is left for our future work."

The specifically designed convolutional architecture encodes not only the semantic similarity of the translation pair, but also the context containing the phrase in the source language. Therefore, our approach is able to capture context-dependent semantic similarities of translation pairs. We adopt a curriculum learning strategy to train the model: we classify the training examples into easy, medium, and difficult categories, and gradually build the ability of representing phrase and sentence level context by using training examples from easy to difficult. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline system by up to 1.4 BLEU points.",
