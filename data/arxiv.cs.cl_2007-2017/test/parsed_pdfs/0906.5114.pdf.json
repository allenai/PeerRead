      "text" : "Why are some languages more alike than others? This question is one of the most central issues in historical linguistics. Typically, one of three answers is given (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2001; Campbell, 2006). First, the languages may be related “genetically.” That is, they may have all derived from a common ancestor language. Second, the similarities may be due to chance. Some language properties are simply more common than others, which is often attributed to be mostly due to linguistic universals (Greenberg, 1963). Third, the languages may be related areally. Languages that occupy the same geographic area often exhibit similar characteristics, not due to genetic relatedness, but due to sharing. Regions (and the languages contained within them) that exhibit sharing are called linguistic areas and the features that are shared are called areal features.\nMuch is not understood or agreed upon in the field of areal linguistics. Different linguists favor different defintions of what it means to be a linguistic area (are two languages sufficient to describe an area or do you need three (Thomason, 2001; Katz, 1975)?),\nwhat areal features are (is there a linear ordering of “borrowability” (Katz, 1975; Curnow, 2001) or is that too prescriptive?), and what causes sharing to take place (does social status or number of speakers play a role (Thomason, 2001)?).\nIn this paper, we attempt to provide a statistical answer to some of these questions. In particular, we develop a Bayesian model of typology that allows for, but does not force, the existence of linguistic areas. Our model also allows for, but does not force, preference for some feature to be shared areally. When applied to a large typological database of linguistic features (Haspelmath et al., 2005), we find that it discovers linguistic areas that are well documented in the literature (see Campbell (2005) for an overview), and a small preference for certain features to be shared areally. This latter agrees, to a lesser degree, with some of the published hierarchies of borrowability (Curnow, 2001). Finally, we show that reconstructing language family trees is significantly aided by knowledge of areal features. We note that Warnow et al. (2005) have independently proposed a model for phonological change in Indo-European (based on the Dyen dataset (Dyen et al., 1992)) that includes notions of borrowing. Our model is different in that we (a) base our model on typological features rather than just lexical patterns and (b) we explicitly represent language areas, not just one-time borrowing phenomena."

      "text" : "Areal effects on linguistic typology have been studied since, at least, the late 1920s by Trubetzkoy, though the idea of tracing family trees for languages goes back to the mid 1800s and the comparative study of historical linguistics dates back, perhaps to Giraldus Cambrenis in 1194 (Campbell, In press). A recent article provides a short introduction to both the issues that surround areal linguistics, as well as an enumeration of many of the known language areas (Campbell, 2005). A fairly wide, modern treatment of the issues surrounding areal diffusion is also given by essays in a recent book edited by Aikhenvald and Dixon (2001). The essays in this book provide a good introduction to the issues in the field. Campbell (2006) provides a critical survey of these and other hypotheses relating to areal linguistics.\nThere are several issues which are basic to the study of areal linguistics (these are copied almost directly from Campbell (2006)). Must a linguistic area comprise more than two languages? Must it comprise more than one language family? Is a single trait sufficient to define an area? How “nearby” must languages in an area be to one another? Are some feature more easily borrowed that others?\nDespite these formal definitional issues of what constitutes a language area and areal features, most historical linguists seem to believe that areal effects play some role in the change of languages."

      "text" : "Below, we list some of the well-known linguistic areas; Campbell (2005) provides are more complete listing together with example areal features for these areas. For each area, we list associated languages: The Balkans: Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, Macedonian, Rumanian and Serbo-Croatian. (Sometimes: Romani and Turkish) South Asian: Languages belonging to the Dravidian, Indo-Aryan, Munda, Tibeto-Burman families. Meso-America: Cuitlatec, Huave, Mayan, MixeZoquean, Nahua, Otomanguean, Tarascan, Tequistlatecan, Totonacan and Xincan. North-west America: Alsea, Chimakuan, Coosan, Eyak, Haida, Kalapuyan, Lower Chinook, Salishan, Takelman, Tlingit, Tsimshian and Wakashan. The Baltic: Baltic languages, Baltic German, and\nFinnic languages (especially Estonian and Livonian). (Sometimes many more are included, such as: Belorussian, Lavian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Old Prussian, Polish, Romani, Russian, Ukranian.) Ethiopia: Afar, Amharic, Anyuak, Awngi, Beja, Ge’ez, Gumuz, Janjero, Kefa, Sidamo, Somali, Tigre, Tigrinya and Wellamo.\nNeedless to say, the exact definition and extent of the actual areas is up to significant debate. Moreover, claims have been made in favor of many linguistic areas not defined above. For instance, Dixon (2001) presents arguments for several Australian linguistic areas and Matisoff (2001) defines a SouthEast Asian language area. Finally, although “folk lore” is in favor of identifying a linguistic area including English, French and certain Norse languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Low Dutch, High German, etc.), there are counter-arguments to this position (Thomason, 2001) (see especially Case Study 9.8)."

      "text" : "Identifying which linguistic features are most easily shared “areally” is a long standing problem in contact linguistics. Here we briefly review some of the major claims. Much of this overview is adoped from the summary given by Curnow (2001).\nHaugen (1950) considers only borrowability as far as the lexicon is concerned. He provided evidence that nouns are the easiest, followed by verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, etc. Ross (1988) corroborates Haugen’s analysis and deepens it to cover morphology, syntax and phonology. He proposes the following hierarchy of borrowability (easiest items coming first): nouns > verbs > adjectives > syntax > non-bound function words > bound morphemes > phonemes. Coming from a “constraints” perspective, Moravcsik (1978) suggests that: lexical items must be borrowed before lexical properties; inflected words before bound morphemes; verbal items can never be borrowed; etc.\nCurnow (2001) argues that coming up with a reasonable hierarchy of borrowability is that “we may never be able to develop such constraints.” Nevertheless, he divides the space of borrowable features into 15 categories and discusses the evidence supporting each of these categories, including: phonetics (rare), phonology (common), lexical (very common), interjections and discourse markers (com-\nmon), free grammatical forms (occasional), bound grammatical forms (rare), position of morphology (rare), syntactic frames (rare), clause-internal syntax (common), between-clause syntax (occasional)."

      "text" : "We treat the problem of understanding areal linguistics as a statistical question, based on a database of typological information. Due to the issues raised in the previous section, we do not want to commit to the existence of a particular number of linguistic areas, or particular sizes thereof. (Indeed, we do not even want to commit to the existence of any linguistic areas.) However, we will need to “unify” the languages that fall into a linguistic area (if such a thing exists) by means of some statistical parameter. Such problems have been studied under the name non-parametric models. The idea behind nonparametric models is that one does not commit a priori to a particularly number of parameters. Instead, we allow the data to dictate how many parameters there are. In Bayesian modeling, non-parametric distributions are typically used as priors; see Jordan (2005) or Ghahramani (2005) for overviews. In our model, we use two different non-parametric priors: the Pitman-Yor process (for modeling linguistic areas) and Kingman’s coalescent (for modeling linguistic phylogeny), both described below."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2.1 The Pitman-Yor Process",
      "text" : "One particular example of a non-parametric prior is the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997), which can be seen as an extension to the betterknown Dirichlet process (Ferguson, 1974). The Pitman-Yor process can be understood as a particular example of a Chinese Restaurant process (CRP) (Pitman, 2002). The idea in all CRPs is that there exists a restaurant with an infinite number of tables. Customers come into the restaurant and have to choose a table at which to sit.\nThe Pitman-Yor process is described by three parameters: a base rate α, a discount parameter d and a mean distribution G0. These combine to describe a process denoted by PY(α, d,G0). The parameters α and d must satisfy: 0 ≤ d < 1 and α > −d. In the CRP analogy, the model works as follows. The first customer comes in and sits at any table. After N customers have come in and seated themselves (at a total of K tables), the N th customer arrives. In\nthe Pitman-Yor process, the N th customer sits at a new table with probability proportional to α + Kd and sits at a previously occupied table k with probability proportional to #k − d, where #k is the number of customers already seated at table k. Finally, with each table k we associate a parameter θk, with each θk drawn independently from G0. An important property of the Pitman-Yor process is that draws from it are exchangable: perhaps counterintuitively, the distribution does not care about customer order.\nThe Pitman-Yor process induces a power-law distribution on the number of singleton tables (i.e., the number of tables that have only one customer). This can be seen by noticing two things. In general, the number of singleton tables grows as O(αNd). When d = 0, we obtain a Dirichlet process with the number of singleton tables growing as O(α logN)."

      "heading" : "2.2.2 Kingman’s Coalescent",
      "text" : "Kingman’s coalescent is a standard model in population genetics describing the common genealogy (ancestral tree) of a set of individuals (Kingman, 1982b; Kingman, 1982a). In its full form it is a distribution over the genealogy of a countable set.\nConsider the genealogy of n individuals alive at the present time t = 0. We can trace their ancestry backwards in time to the distant past t = −∞. Assume each individual has one parent (in genetics, haploid organisms), and therefore genealogies of [n] = {1, . . . , n} form a directed forest. Kingman’s n-coalescent is simply a distribution over genealogies of n individuals. To describe the Markov process in its entirety, it is sufficient to describe the jump process (i.e. the embedded, discrete-time, Markov chain over partitions) and the distribution over coalescent times. In the n-coalescent, every pair of lineages merges independently with rate 1, with parents chosen uniformly at random from the set of possible parents at the previous time step.\nThe n-coalescent has some interesting statistical properties (Kingman, 1982b; Kingman, 1982a). The marginal distribution over tree topologies is uniform and independent of the coalescent times. Secondly, it is infinitely exchangeable: given a genealogy drawn from an n-coalescent, the genealogy of any m contemporary individuals alive at time t≤ 0 embedded within the genealogy is a draw from the m-coalescent. Thus, taking n→∞, there is a distri-\nbution over genealogies of a countably infinite population for which the marginal distribution of the genealogy of any n individuals gives the n-coalescent. Kingman called this the coalescent.\nTeh et al. (2007) recently described efficient inference algorithms for Kingman’s coalescent. They applied the coalescent to the problem of recovering linguistic phylogenies. The application was largely successful—at least in comparison to alternative algorithms that use the same data-. Unfortunately, even in the results they present, one can see significant areal effects. For instance, in their Figure(3a), Romanian is very near Albanian and Bulgarian. This is likely an areal effect: specifically, an effect due to the Balkan langauge area. We will revisit this issue in our own experiments."

      "text" : "We will consider a data set consisting of N languages and F typological features. We denote the value of feature f in language n as Xn,f . For simplicity of exposition, we will assume two things: (1) there is no unobserved data and (2) all features are binary. In practice, for the data we use (described in Section 4), neither of these is true. However, both extensions are straightforward.\nWhen we construct our model, we attempt to be as neutral to the “areal linguistics” questions defined in Section 2.1 as possible. We allow areas with only two languages (though for brevity we do not present them in the results). We allow areas with only one family (though, again, do not present them). We are generous with our notion of locality, allowing a radius of 1000 kilometers (though see Section 5.4 for an analysis of the effect of radius).1 And we allow, but do not enforce trait weights. All of this is accomplished through the construction of the model and the choice of the model hyperparameters.\nAt a high-level, our model works as follows. Values Xn,f appear for one of two reasons: they are either areally derived or genetically derived. A latent variable Zn,f determines this. If it is derived areally, then the value Xn,f is drawn from a latent variable\n1An reader might worry about exchangeability: Our method of making language centers and locations part of the Pitman-Yor distribution ensures this is not an issue. An alternative would be to use a location-sensitive process such as the kernel stickbreaking process (Dunson and Park, 2007), though we do not explore that here.\ncorresponding to the value preferences in the langauge area to which language n belongs. If it is derived genetically, thenXn,f is drawn from a variable corresponding to value preferences for the genetic substrate to which language n belongs. The set of areas, and the area to which a language belongs are given by yet more latent variables. It is this aspect of the model for which we use the Pitman-Yor process: languages are customers, areas are tables and area value preferences are the parameters of the tables."

By having the parameter feature-specific, we express the fact that some features may be more or less likely to be shared than others. In other words, a high value of πf would mean that feature f is easily shared areally, while a low value would mean that feature f is hard to share. Each language n has a known latitude/longitude `n.\nWe further assume that there are K linguistic areas, whereK is treated non-parametrically by means of the Pitman-Yor process. Note that in our context, a linguistic area may contain only one language, which would technically not be allowed according to the linguistic definition. When a language belongs to a singleton area, we interpret this to mean that it does not belong to any language area.\nEach language area k (including the singleton areas) has a set of F associated parameters φk,f , where φk,f is the probability that feature f is “on” in area k. It also has a “central location” given by a longitude and latitude denoted ck. We only allow languages to belong to areas that fall within a given radius R of them (distances computed according to geodesic distance). This accounts for the “geographical” constraints on language areas. We denote the area to which language n belongs as an.\nWe assume that each language belongs to a “family tree.” We denote the parent of language n in the\n2As mentioned in the introduction, (at least) one more option is possible: chance.

We associate with each node i in the family tree and each feature f a parameter θi,f . As in the areal case, θi,f is the probability that feature f is on for languages that descend from node i in the family tree. We model genetic trees by Kingman’s coalescent with binomial mutation.\nFinally, we put non-informative priors on all the hyperparameters. Written hierarchically, our model has the following shown in Figure 1. There, by (p, θ) ∼ Coalescent(π0,m0), we mean that the tree and parameters are given by a coalescent."

Experimentally, this resulted in an acceptance rate of about 50%.\nIn our implementation, we analytically integrate out π and φ and sample only over Z, the coalescent tree, and the area assignments.

The database is sparse: only 16% of the possible language/feature pairs are known. We use the version extracted and prepro-\ncessed by Daumé III and Campbell (2007).

The Austronesian family includes seventeen geni, including: Borneo, Oceanic, Palauan and Sundic. Overall, there are 275 geni represented in WALS.\nWe further preprocess the data as follows.

We run each experiment with five random restarts and 2000 iterations. We select the MAP configuration from the combination of these runs.\nIn the IE experiment, the model identified the areas shown in Figure 5.1.

The fourth area identified by our model corresponds roughly to the debated “English” area. Our area includes the requisite French/English/German/Norwegian group, as well as the somewhat surprising Irish. However, in addition to being intuitively plausible, it is not hard to find evidence in the literature for the contact relationship between English and Irish (Sommerfelt, 1960).\nIn the whole-world experiment, the model identified too many linguistic areas to fit (39 in total that contained at least two languages, and contained at least two language families). In Figure 5.1, we depict the areas found by our model that best correspond to the areas described in Section 2.1.1. We acknowledge that this gives a warped sense of the quality of our model. Nevertheless, our model is able to identify large parts of the the Meso-American area, the Baltic area and the South Asian area. (It also finds the Balkans, but since these languages are all IE, we do not consider it a linguistic area in this evaluation.) While our model does find areas that match Meso-American and North-west American areas, neither is represented in its entirety (according to the definition of these areas given in Sec-\ntion 2.1.1). Despite the difficulty humans have in assigning linguistic areas, In Table 1, we explicitly compare the quality of the areal clusters found on the IE subset. We compare against the most inclusive areal lists from Section 2.1.1 for IE: the Balkans and the Baltic. When there is overlap (eg., Romani appears in both lists), we assigned it to the Balkans.\nWe compare our model with a flat Pitman-Yor model that does not use the hierarchy. We also compare to a baseline K-means algorithm. For Kmeans, we ran with K ∈ {5, 10, 15, . . . , 80, 85} and chose the value of K for each metric that did best (giving an unfair advantage). Clustering performance is measured on the Indo-European task according to the Rand Index, F-score, Normalized Edit Score (Pantel, 2003) and Normalized Variation of Information (Meila, 2003). In these results, we see that the Pitman-Yor process model dominates the K-means model and the Areal model dominates the Pitman-Yor model."

For this experiment, we make use of the whole-world version of the data, again with known language family structure. We initialize a Gibbs sampler from the MAP configuration found in Section 5.1. We run the sampler for 1000 iterations and take samples every ten steps.\nFrom one particular sample, we can estimate a posterior distribution over each πf . Due to conjugacy, we obtain a posterior distribution of πf ∼ Bet(1 + ∑ n Zn,f , 1 + ∑ n[1−Zn,f ]). The 1s come from the prior. From this Beta distribution, we can ask the question: what is the probability that a value of πf drawn from this distribution will have value < 0.5? If this value is high, then the feature is likely\nto be a “genetic feature”; if it is low, then the feature is likely to be an “areal feature.” We average these probabilities across all 100 samples.\nThe features that are most likely to be areal according to our model are summaries in Table 2. In this table, we list the categories to which each feature belongs, together with the number of features in that category, and the average probability that a feature in that category is genetically transmitted. Apparently, the vast majority of features are not areal.\nWe can treat the results presented in Table 2 as a hierarchy of borrowability. In doing so, we see that our hierarchy agrees to a large degree with the hierarchies summarized in Section 2.1.2. Indeed, (aside from “Tea”, which we will ignore) the two most easily shared categories according to our model are phonology and the lexicon; this is in total agreement with the agreed state of affairs in linguistics.\nLower in our list, we see that noun-related categories tend to precede their verb-related counterparts (nominal categories before verbal categores, nominal syntax before complex sentences). According to Curnow (2001), the most difficult features to borrow are phonetics (for which we have no data), bound grammatical forms (which appear low on our list), morphology (which is 99% genetic, according to our model) and syntactic frames (which would roughly correspond to “complex sentences”, another\nitem which is 99% genetic in our model)."

(2007). This method was already shown to outperform competing hierarchical clustering algorithms such as average-link agglomerative clustering (see, eg., Duda and Hart (1973)) and the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (Heller and Ghahramani, 2005).\nWe run the same experiment both on the IE subset of data and on the whole-world subset. We evaluate the results qualitatively, by observing the trees found (on the IE subset) and quantitatively (below). For the qualitative analysis, we show the subset of IE that does not contain Indic languages or Iranian languages (just to keep the figures small). The tree derived from the original data is on the left in Figure 4, below: The tree based on areal information is on the right in Figure 4, below. As we can see, the use of areal information qualitatively improves the structure of the tree. Where the original tree had a number of errors with respect to Romance and Germanic languages, these are sorted out in the areally-aware tree. Moreover, Greek now appears in a more appropriate part of the tree and English appears on a branch that is further out from the Norse languages.\nWe perform two varieties of quantitative analysis. In the first, we attempt to predict unknown feature values. In particular, we hide an addition 10% of the feature values in the WALS data and fit a model\nto the remaining 90%. We then use that model to predict the hidden 10%. The baseline model is to make predictions according to the family tree. The augmented model is to make predictions according to the family tree for those features identified as genetic and according to the linguistic area for those features identified as areal. For both settings, we compute both the absolute accuracy as well as the log probability of the hidden data under the model (the latter is less noisy). We repeat this experiment 10 times with a different random 10% hidden. The results are shown in Table 3, below. The differences are not large, but are outside one standard deviation.\nFor the second quantitative analysis, we use present purity scores (Heller and Ghahramani, 2005), subtree scores (the number of interior nodes with pure leaf labels, normalized) and leave-one-out log accuracies (all scores are between 0 and 1, and higher scores are better). These scores are computed against both language family and language genus as the “classes.” The results are in Table 4, below.

Some language properties are simply more common than others, which is often attributed to be mostly due to linguistic universals (Greenberg, 1963). Third, the languages may be related areally. Languages that occupy the same geographic area often exhibit similar characteristics, not due to genetic relatedness, but due to sharing.
