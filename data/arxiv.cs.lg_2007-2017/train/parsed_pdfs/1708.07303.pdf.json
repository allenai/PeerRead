      "text" : "Learning to interact with objects is a fundamental and challenging problem in artificial intelligence that involves perception, motion planning, and control. The problem is challenging because it not only requires understanding geometry (global shape of object, local surface around interaction) but it also requires estimating physical properties, such as weight of object, density and friction. Furthermore, it requires invariance to illumination, objects’ location and viewpoint. To handle this, current datadriven approaches use thousands of examples and learn end-to-end models. But collecting such large-scale data is extremely difficult and time-consuming. Is it possible to constrain the learning process somehow so that we can learn representation for interaction with less data?\nWe argue that geometry is at the heart of this type of interaction and propose the concept of geometryaware learning agent with the following properties: (1) agent has a clear notion of the geometry: the location, orientation, and shape of object from visual input. Therefore, the agent is able to distinguish its ego-motion from the motions in the environment. (2) agent is able to relate the geometry of novel object with its previous experience and (3) agent is able to reason about the relationship between interaction and feedback (i.e., success or failure) by taking the geometry factors into consideration.\n∗The work was done while interning at Google Brain.\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n07 30\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 2\n4 A\nug 2\nCompared to a learning agent that does not have explicit notion of geometry, we believe that the geometry-aware agent will learn a better understanding of interaction, feedback and geometry.\nIn this work, we propose a two-stage procedure for learning grasping interaction from demonstrations. First, the agent learns to build the geometry-aware representation from 2D visual input. Second, the agent learns to predict grasping interaction from demonstrations with the built-in geometry-aware representation. More specifically, we design an encoder-decoder deep neural network for learning this representation. Our geometry-aware encoder-decoder network has two components: a shape prediction network and a grasping outcome prediction network. The shape prediction network has an image encoder, a 3D shape decoder, and a learning-free OpenGL projection layer. The image encoder transforms the 2D visual data into the high-level geometry representation. The shape decoder network takes in the geometry representation and outputs the 3D volume of the object. To enable supervision with only 2D visual data, we propose a novel learning-free OpenGL projection layer similar to Yan et al. [2016], Rezende et al. [2016]. The grasping outcome prediction network has a state encoder and an outcome predictor. The state encoder network transforms the current visual state (e.g., object and gripper) to a high-level state representation. The outcome predictor network takes in an action, a state, and the geometry representations to produce an outcome (e.g., success or failure) of the grasping interaction.\nWe have built a large database consisting of 101 everyday objects with more than 150K grasping demonstrations in Virtual Reality (VR) with both human and artificial interactions. For each object, we collect 10-20 grasping attempts with a 1-DoF virtual gripper from right-handed users. For each attempt, we record a pre-grasp status which includes the location and orientation of the object and gripper, as well as the grasping outcome (e.g., success or failure). Additionally, we augment the data by perturbing the gripper location and orientation based on grasping demonstrations in the Bullet Physics simulator.\nOur main contributions are summarized below:\n• We build a database with rich visual sensory data and grasping annotations. • We demonstrate that the proposed geometry-aware encoder-decoder network is able to learn\nthe shape as well as grasping outcome better than models without notion of geometry. • We demonstrate that the proposed model has advantages in guiding grasping exploration\nand achieves better generalization to novel viewpoints and novel object instances."

[2008], Montesano and Lopes [2012], Lenz et al. [2015],\nPinto and Gupta [2016]. Earlier work Saxena et al. [2008], Montesano and Lopes [2012] studied the planar grasping problem using visual features extracted from 2D sensory input and adopted logistic regression for fitting optimal grasping location with visual features. Lenz et al. [2015] proposed a two-step detection pipeline (object detection and grasping part detection) with deep neural networks. Pinto and Gupta [2016] built a robotic system for learning grasping from large-scale real-world trial-and-error experiments. In this work, a deep convolutional neural network was trained on 700 hours robotic grasping data collected from the system.\nFine-grained grasping planning and control often involves 3D modeling of object shape, modeling dynamics of robot hands, and local surface modeling Goldfeder et al. [2009], Leon et al. [2010], Johns et al. [2016], Varley et al. [2016], Li et al. [2016], Vahrenkamp et al. [2016], Mahler et al. [2016, 2017]. Some work focused on analytic modeling of robotic grasps with known object shape information Goldfeder et al. [2009], Leon et al. [2010]. Varley et al. [2016] proposed a shape completion model that reconstructs the 3D occupancy grid for robotic grasping from partial observations, where ground-truth 3D occupancy grid is used during model training. Li et al. [2016] investigated the hand pose estimation in robotic grasping by decoupling contact points and hand configuration with parametrized object shape. Building upon the compositional aspect of everyday objects, Vahrenkamp et al. [2016] proposed a part-based model for robotic grasping that has better generalization to novel object. Very recently, effort was also made in building DexNet Mahler et al. [2016, 2017], a large-scale point cloud database for planar grasping. In addition to general robotic grasping, several recent work investigated the semantic or task-specific grasping Dang and Allen [2014], Katz et al. [2014], Nikandrova and Kyrki [2015].\nIn contrast to existing learning frameworks applied to robotic grasping, our approach features (1) an end-to-end deep learning framework for generative 3D shape modeling and predictive grasping interaction and (2) learning-free projection layer that links the 2D observations with 3D object shape."

Being able to generate 3D object shapes (e.g., volumetric representation) from any scene given 2D sensory input is a very important feature of our geometry-aware agent.

      "text" : "For simplicity, we begin with a single-view formulation. If the ground-truth 3D volumetric representation V is given, we can fit a functional mapping fV : I → V that approximates the 3D object shape from 2D sensory input I . However, the ground-truth 3D object shape (e.g., explicit supervision of 3D volume or occupancy grid) is not always directly available. Inspired by Rezende et al. [2016], Yan et al. [2016], we tackle the 3D shape learning in a weakly supervised manner without explicit 3D shape supervision. In Yan et al. [2016], an in-network projection layer is introduced for 3D shape learning from 2D masks (e.g. 2D silhouette of object). However, a 2D silhouette is an insufficient supervision signal (e.g., consider the concave shape) in robotic grasping. Therefore, we also consider a 2D depth map D as the supervision signal for learning the object geometry.2 To find the correspondence between a 3D shape and 2D depth map, we introduce a learning-free projective operator similar to Yan et al. [2016] that implements the exact rendering procedure for 2D depth estimation from the 3D world.\nWe formulate the projective operation by fD : V × P → D that transforms a 3D shape into a 2D depth map with the camera transformation matrix P. Here, the camera transformation matrix decomposes as P = K[R; t], where K is the camera intrinsic matrix, R is the camera rotation matrix, and t is the camera translation vector. In our implementation, we also use a 2D silhouette as an object maskM for learning. Empirically, we found that this additional objective makes the learning easier during training. Finally, given a 2D observation I from a single-view, the loss function is defined as follows:\nLsingleθ = λDL depth θ (D̂;D) + λML mask θ (M̂;M) (1)\n2Our design choice of using RGBD as an input signal is also motivated from the common availability of RGBD sensors in most robot platforms.\nHere, λD and λM are the constant coefficients for the depth and mask prediction terms, respectively.\nLearning-free projective operator for depth estimation. Following the OpenGL camera transformation standard, for each point psj = (x s j , y s j , z s j , 1) in 3D world frame, we compute the corresponding point pnj = (x n j , y n j , z n j , 1) in the normalized device coordinate system (−1 ≤ xnj , ynj , znj ≤ 1) using the transformation: pnj ∼ Ppsj . Here, the conversion from depth buffer znj to real depth zej is given by zej = f e(znj ) = −1/(α ∗ znj + β) where α = Znear−Zfar 2ZnearZfar\nand β = Znear+Zfar2ZnearZfar . Here, Zfar and Znear represents the far and near clipping planes of the camera.\nSimilar to the transformer network proposed in Yan et al. [2016], Jaderberg et al. [2015], our learning-free projection can be considered as: (1) performing dense sampling from input volume (in the 3D world frame) to output volume (in normalized device coordinates); and (2) flattening the 3D spatial output across one dimension. Again, each 3D point (xsj , y s j , z s j ) in input volume V ∈ RH×W×D and corresponding point (xnj , ynj , znj ) in output volume U ∈ RH ′×W ′×D′ are related by the transformation matrix P. Here, (W,H,D) and (W ′, H ′, D′) are the width, height, and depth of the input and output volume, respectively. We summarize the dense sampling step and channel-wise flattening step in Eq. 2.\nUj = H∑ n W∑ m D∑ l Vnmlmax(0, 1− |xsj −m|)max(0, 1− |ysj − n|)max(0, 1− |zsj − l|)\nMn′m′ = max l′ Un′m′l′\nDn′m′ = { Zfar, ifMn′m′ = 0 fe( 2l ′\nD′ − 1) where l ′ = argminl′(Un′m′l′ > 0.5), otherwise\n(2)\nIntuitively, the learning-free projective operator is performing ray-tracing along the projection axis.\nLearning from multi-view observations. Learning to predict 3D shape from single-view 2D sensory input is a challenging task in computer vision due to shape ambiguity. To reduce ambiguity in shape prediction, we assume multiple observations of the scene are available during model training. From the interaction perspective, multi-view observations also provide useful additional input to the system. Given a series of n observations I1, I2, · · · , In of the scene, the 3D reconstruction can be formulated as fV : {Ii}ni=1 → V. Similarly, the projective operation from i-th viewpoint is fD : V × Pi → Di, where Di and Pi are the depth and camera transformation matrix from corresponding viewpoint, respectively. We define the multi-view loss Lmulti in Eq. 3 with an emphasis on the shape prediction consistency across viewpoints.\nLmultiθ = λD n∑ i=1 Ldepthθ (D̂i,Di) + λM n∑ i=1 Lmaskθ (M̂i,Mi) (3)"

      "text" : "In general, motion planning and control for grasping is very challenging due to many factors involved. In this work, we focus on modeling the pre-grasp status as fine-grained motion planning becomes increasingly important when the gripper reaches close to target object. In our formulation, we assume grasping outcome is binary: either success or failure. The interaction is classified as success only if the action results in a valid grasp. Based on our formulation, the grasping success probability can be directly inferred from the visual observation I of current state and proposed action a = [p,o]. Inspired by previous work Oh et al. [2015], Finn et al. [2016], Dosovitskiy and Koltun [2016], Yang et al. [2015], Pinto et al. [2016], where outcomes are high-order mappings from observations and actions, a straight-forward approach is to fit a functional mapping f lvanilla : I × a→ l. We refer to this model as a vanilla grasping interaction prediction model (see Figure 2(a)).\nBuilding upon the vanilla prediction model, we propose a novel geometry-aware prediction model. That is, the agent learns to predict the grasping interaction by taking the geometry-aware representation as an additional input. The benefits of such geometry-aware representation are two-folds:\n• The geometry-aware representation provides a global shape prior for interaction predictions. • The geometry-aware representation provides 3D information about the local surface centered\naround the interaction event.\nLocal shape inference via projection. In our implementation, we reuse the learning-free projection operator to obtain the local depth given the gripper position and orientation.\nFinally, given a current observation I, proposed action a, and inferred 3D shape representation V, we fit a functional mapping f lgeometry−aware : I ×a×V→ l, where l is the binary label of whether it is a valid grasp."

Our shape encoder network takes RGBD images of resolution 128× 128 and corresponding 4-by-4 camera view matrices as input; the network and outputs identity units as an intermediate representation. Our shape decoder is a 3D deconvolutional neural network that outputs voxels at a resolution of 32 × 32 × 32. We implemented the projection layer (with camera view and projection matrix) that transforms the voxels back into foreground object silhouettes and depth maps at an input resolution (128 × 128). Here, the purpose of generative pre-training is to learn viewpoint invariant units (e.g., object identity units) through object segmentation and depth prediction. The outcome prediction network has a 2D convolutional state encoder and a fully connected outcome predictor with an additional local shape projection layer. Our state encoder takes RGBD images (pre-grasp scene) of resolution 128 × 128 and corresponding actions (position and orientation of the gripper end-effector) and outputs state unit as intermediate representation. Our outcome predictor takes both current state (e.g., pre-grasp scene and action) and shape features (e.g., global shape from identity units and the local surface from the local shape projection layer) into consideration. Note that the local dense sampling transforms the surface around the gripper fingers into a foreground silhouette and a depth map at resolution 48 × 48. For the purpose of better shape representation during training, we feed observations taken from multiple viewpoints to the neural networks. During evaluation, we only provide single-view observation for the model as input."

In total, 1597 human grasps are demonstrated, with an average of 15 grasps per object (with lowest and highest number of grasps at 7 and 39 for a plate and a wine glass, respectively). We randomly split 101 objects into three sets (e.g., training, validation and testing) and make sure each set covers the seven categories (70% for training, 10% for validation and 20% for\ntesting).

To minimize the bias introduced from the data generation pipeline, we randomly posit the camera at a distance ranging between 35 centimetres and 45 centimetres. We draw a camera target position from a normal distribution with its mean as the object center and a desired variance (in our experiment, we use 3 centimetres as standard deviation). Furthermore, we rotate the camera position from 8 different azimuth angles (with steps of 45 degrees) and adjust the elevation from 4 different angles (e.g., 15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees). Here, we include only two elevation angles (e.g., 15 and 45 degrees) in the training set while leaving the other two angles for evaluation.

      "text" : "With a learned geometry-aware representation, our model achieves better classification performance in predicting the grasping outcome. We compared the classification accuracy of the baseline model and our geometry-aware model by conducting extensive evaluations on novel objects (from the testing set) from multiple observation viewpoints. For each human demonstration, we prepared 100 random grasps through perturbation (among which 50% of them are success grasps) and computed the average accuracy on 100 grasps (i.e., random guess achieves 50% accuracy). To investigate the model performance due to viewpoint changes, we repeat the evaluation experiment for four different elevation angles (e.g, 15, 30, 45, and 60 degrees). The results are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Overall, the geometry-aware model performs consistently better than baseline model in outcome classification. As we can see, “teapot” and “plate” are comparatively more challenging categories for outcome prediction, since “teapot” has irregular shape parts (e.g., tip and handle) and “plate” has a fairly flat shape. When it comes to novel elevation angles (e.g., compare Table 1 and Table 2), our geometry-aware model is less affected, especially for categories like “teapot” and “plate” where viewpoint invariant shape understanding is crucial.\nAnalysis: local shape inference via projection. One advantage of our generative shape prediction component is that we can obtain additional local shape information via projection (see the red-dashed box in Figure 2(c)). At testing time, our shape prediction component first generates the 3D voxels given 2D observation (at a distance). With the 3D voxels as part of the intermediate representation, we can further acquire the local shape by running a projection from the gripper’s perspective (i.e., simply treat the gripper as another virtual camera). To further understand the advantages of our generative shape prediction component, we visualized the intermediate local shape representation projected from predicted 3D voxels. As shown in Figure 3, our generative shape prediction component provides reasonably accurate local shape estimation that is useful for grasping outcome prediction.\nApplication: analysis-by-synthesis grasping optimization. With improved prediction over the grasping outcome, a natural question is whether this improvement can be used to guide better grasping\nplanning. Given a seed grasping proposal, we conducted grasping optimization by sequentially proposing grasping locations until a grasp success. For grasping optimization, we performed a simplified version of cross-entropy method (CEM) Rubinstein and Kroese [2004], Levine et al. [2016]. We initialized with a failure grasp in order to force the model to find better grasping location (e.g., position and orientation). At each iteration, we sample 10 random directions and selected the top one based on the score returned by the neural network (output of outcome predictor). We repeat the iterations until success with an upper bound of 20 steps. We ran the same evaluation for both the baseline model and our geometry-aware model. To account for the variations in observation viewpoints and initial seeds, we repeat the evaluation for eight times per testing demonstration in our dataset and reported the average success rate after 20 iterations (marked as failure only if there is no success in 20 steps). As shown in Table 3, CEM guided our geometry-aware model performance consistently better than baseline model. We believe that the improvement results from the explicit use of modeling the object shape in our geometry-aware model. Our model achieved the most significant improvement in the “bottle” category, since a bottle shape is relatively easy to reconstruct. Our improvement in the “bowl” category is less significant, partly due to the failure in predicting its concave shape for testing object instances. Figure 5 shows example grasping optimization trials with different types of objects. The baseline model was stuck at the local region while our geometry-aware model was able to transit from one side of the object to the other optimal position and orientation."

However, learning representations of such interactions is very challenging due to a high dimensional state space, difficulty in collecting large-scale data, and many variations of an object’s visual appearance (i.e. geometry, material, texture, and illumination). We argue that knowledge of 3D geometry is at the heart of grasping interactions and propose the notion of a geometry-aware learning agent. Our key idea is constraining and regularizing interaction learning through 3D geometry prediction. Specifically, we formulate the learning process of a geometry-aware agent as a two-step procedure: First, the agent learns to construct its geometry-aware representation of the scene from 2D sensory input via generative 3D shape modeling. Finally, it learns to predict grasping outcome with its built-in geometry-aware representation. The geometry-aware representation plays a key role in relating geometry and interaction via a novel learning-free depth projection layer. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we build a grasping dataset from demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) with rich sensory and interaction annotations; (2) we demonstrate that the learned geometry-aware representation results in a more robust grasping outcome prediction compared to a baseline model; and (3) we demonstrate the benefits of the learned geometry-aware representation in grasping planning.",
