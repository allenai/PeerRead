One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations especially when a poor morphology language is used as the pivot between rich morphology languages. In this paper, we examine the use of synchronous morphology constraint features to improve the quality of phrase pivot SMT. We compare hand-crafted constraints to those learned from limited parallel data between source and target languages. The learned morphology constraints are based on projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table.

      "text" : "One of the main challenges in statistical machine translation (SMT) is the scarcity of parallel data for many language pairs especially when the source and target languages are morphologically rich. A common SMT solution to the lack of parallel data is to pivot the translation through a third language (called pivot or bridge language) for which there exist abundant parallel corpora with the source and target languages. The literature covers many pivoting techniques. One of the best performing techniques, phrase pivoting (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007), builds an induced new phrase table between the source and target. One of the main issues of this technique is that the size of the newly created pivot phrase table is very large. Moreover, many of the produced phrase pairs are of low quality which affects the translation choices during decoding and the overall translation quality.\nIn this paper, we focus on improving phrase pivoting. We introduce morphology constraint scores which are added to the log linear space of features in order to determine the quality of the pivot phrase pairs. We compare two methods of generating the morphology constraints. One method is based on hand-crafted rules relying on the authors knowledge of the source and target languages; while in the other method, the morphology constraints are induced from\navailable parallel data between the source and target languages which we also use to build a direct translation model. We then combine both the pivot and direct models to achieve better coverage and overall translation quality. We show positive results on Hebrew-Arabic SMT. We get 1.5 BLEU points over a phrase-pivot baseline and 0.8 BLEU points over a system combination baseline with a direct model built from given parallel data.\nNext, we briefly discuss some related work. In Section 3, we review the best performing pivoting strategy and how we use it. In Section 4, we discuss the linguistic differences among Hebrew, Arabic, and the pivot language, English. This is followed by our approach to using morphology constraints in Section 5. We finally present our experimental results in Section 6 and a case study in Section 7."

      "text" : "Many researchers have investigated the use of pivoting (or bridging) approaches to solve the data scarcity issue (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2009; Khalilov et al., 2008; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Habash and Hu, 2009). The main idea is to introduce a pivot language, for which there exist large source-pivot and pivot-target bilingual corpora. Pivoting has been explored for closely related languages (Hajič et al., 2000) as well as unrelated languages (Koehn et al., 2009; Habash and Hu, 2009). Many different pivot strategies have been presented in the literature. The following three are the most common. The first strategy is the sentence translation technique in which we first translate the source sentence to the pivot language, and then translate the pivot language sentence to the target language (Khalilov et al., 2008). The second strategy is based on phrase pivoting (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2009). In phrase pivoting, a new source-target phrase table (translation model) is induced from source-pivot and pivot-target phrase tables. Lexical weights and translation probabilities are computed from the two translation models. The third strategy is to create a synthetic source-target corpus by translating the pivot side of source-pivot corpus to the target language using an existing pivot-target model (Bertoldi et al., 2008). In this paper, we use the phrase pivoting approach, which has been shown to be the best with comparable settings (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007).\nThere has been recent efforts in improving phrase pivoting. One effort focused on improving alignment symmetrization targeting pivot phrase systems (El Kholy and Habash, 2014). In another recent effort, Multi-Synchronous Context-free Grammar (MSCFG) is leveraged to triangulate source-pivot and pivot-target synchronous Context-free Grammar (SCFG) rule tables into a source-target-pivot MSCFG rule table that helps in remembering the pivot during decoding. Also, pivot LMs are used to assess the naturalness of the derivation (Miura et al., 2015).\nIn our own previous work, we demonstrated quality improvement using connectivity strength features between the source and target phrase pairs in the pivot phrase table (El Kholy et al., 2013). These features provide quality scores based on the number of alignment links between words in the source phrase to words of the target phrase. In this work, we extend on the connectivity scores with morphological constraints through which we provide quality scores based on the morphological compatibility between the connected/aligned source and target words.\nSince both Hebrew and Arabic are morphologically rich, we should mention that there has been a lot of work on translation to and from morphologically rich languages (Yeniterzi and Oflazer, 2010; Elming and Habash, 2009; El Kholy and Habash, 2010; Habash and Sadat, 2006; Kathol and Zheng, 2008). Most of these efforts are focused on syntactic and morphological processing to improve the quality of translation.\nUntil recently, there has not been much parallel Hebrew-English and Hebrew-Arabic data (Tsvetkov and Wintner, 2010), and consequently little work on Hebrew-English and Hebrew-\nArabic SMT. Lavie et al. (2004) built a transfer-based translation system for Hebrew-English and so did Shilon et al. (2012) for translation between Hebrew and Arabic. Our previous work discussed above (El Kholy et al., 2013) was demonstrated on Hebrew-Arabic with English pivoting."

      "text" : "In this section, we review the phrase pivoting strategy in detail as we describe how we built our baseline for Arabic-Hebrew via pivoting on English. We also discuss how we overcome the large expansion of source-to-target phrase pairs in the process of creating a pivot phrase table. In phrase pivoting (which is sometimes called triangulation or phrase table multiplication), we train a Hebrew-Arabic and an English-Arabic translation models, such as those used in the sentence pivoting technique. Based on these two models, we induce a new HebrewArabic translation model. Since our models are based on a Moses phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007), we use the standard set of phrase-based translation probability distributions.1 We follow Utiyama and Isahara (2007) in computing the pivot phrase pair probabilities. The following are the set of equations used to compute the lexical probabilities (pw) and the phrase translation probabilities (φ):\nφ(h|a) = ∑\ne\nφ(h|e)φ(e|a)\nφ(a|h) = ∑\ne\nφ(a|e)φ(e|h)\npw(h|a) = ∑\ne\npw(h|e)pw(e|a)\npw(a|h) = ∑\ne\npw(a|e)pw(e|h)\nAbove, h is the Hebrew source phrase; e is the English pivot phrase that is common in both Hebrew-English translation model and English-Arabic translation model; and a is the Arabic target phrase. We also build a Hebrew-Arabic reordering table using the same technique but we compute the reordering probabilities in a similar manner to Henriquez et al. (2010).\nFiltering for Phrase Pivoting As discussed earlier, the induced Hebrew-Arabic phrase and reordering tables are very large. Table 1 shows the amount of parallel corpora used to train the Hebrew-English and the English-Arabic and the equivalent phrase table sizes compared to the induced Hebrew-Arabic phrase table.2 We follow the work of El Kholy et al. (2013) and filter the phrase pairs used in pivoting based on log-linear scores. The main idea of the filtering process is to select the top [n] English candidate phrases for each Hebrew phrase from the Hebrew-English phrase table and similarly select the top [n] Arabic target phrases for each English phrase from the English-Arabic phrase table and then perform the pivoting process described earlier to create a pivoted Hebrew-Arabic phrase table. To select the top candidates, we\n1Four different phrase translation scores are computed in Moses’ phrase tables: two lexical weighting scores and two phrase translation probabilities.\n2The size of the induced phrase table size is computed but not created.\nfirst rank all the candidates based on the log linear scores computed from the phrase translation probabilities and lexical weights multiplied by the optimized decoding weights then we pick the top [n] pairs. In our experiments, we pick the top 1000 pairs for pivoting."

      "text" : "In this section we present the challenges of preprocessing Arabic, Hebrew, and English, and how we address them. Both Arabic and Hebrew are morphologically complex languages. One aspect of Arabic’s complexity is its various attachable clitics and numerous morphological features (Habash, 2010). Clitics include conjunction proclitics, e.g., +ð w+3 ‘and’, prepositional proclitics, e.g., +È l+ ‘to/for’, the definite article +È@ Al+ ‘the’, and the class of pronominal enclitics, e.g., Ñë+ +hm ‘their/them’. All of these clitics are separate words in English. Beyond the clitics, Arabic words inflect for person, gender, number, aspect, mood, voice, state and case. Additionally, Arabic orthography uses optional diacritics for short vowels and consonant doubling. This, together with Arabic’s morphological richness, leads to a high degree of ambiguity: about 12 analyses per word, typically corresponding to two lemmas on average (Habash, 2010). We follow El Kholy and Habash (2010) and use the PATB tokenization scheme (Maamouri et al., 2004) in our experiments. The PATB scheme separates all clitics except for the determiner clitic Al+(DET). We use MADA v3.1 (Habash and Rambow, 2005; Habash et al., 2009) to tokenize the Arabic text. We only evaluate on detokenized and orthographically correct (enriched) output following the work of El Kholy and Habash (2010).\nSimilar to Arabic, Hebrew poses computational processing challenges typical of Semitic languages (Itai and Wintner, 2008; Shilon et al., 2012). Hebrew orthography also uses optional diacritics and its morphology inflects for gender, number, person, state, tense and definiteness. Furthermore, Similar to Arabic, Hebrew has a set of attachable clitics, e.g., conjunctions (such as + !ו w+4 ‘and’), prepositions (such as + !ב b+ ‘in’), the definite article (+ !ה h+ ‘the’), or pronouns (such as !םה+ +hm ‘their’). These issues contribute to a high degree of ambiguity that is a challenge to translation from Hebrew to English or to any other language. We follow Singh and Habash (2012)’s best preprocessing setup which utilized a Hebrew tagger (Adler, 2007) and produced a tokenization scheme that separated all clitics.\nEnglish, our pivot language, is quite different from both Arabic and Hebrew. English is poor in morphology and barely inflects for number and tense, and for person in a limited context. English preprocessing simply includes down-casing, separating punctuation and splitting off “’s”."

      "text" : "One of the main challenges in phrase pivoting is the very large size of the induced phrase table. It becomes even more challenging if either the source or target language is morphologically rich. The number of translation candidates (fanout) increases due to ambiguity and richness which in return increases the number of combinations between source and target phrases. Since the only criteria of matching between the source and target phrase is through a pivot phrase, many of the induced phrase pairs are of low quality. These phrase pairs unnecessarily increase the search space and hurt the overall quality of translation. A basic solution to the combinatorial expansion is to filter the phrase pairs used in pivoting based on log-linear scores as discussed in Section 3, however, this doesn’t solve the low quality problem.\n3Arabic transliteration throughout the paper is presented in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter scheme (Habash et al., 2007).\n4The following Hebrew 1-to-1 transliteration is used (in Hebrew alphabetical order): abgdhwzxTiklmns‘pcqršt. All examples are undiacritized and final forms are not distinguished from non-final forms.\nSimilar to factored translation models (Koehn and Hoang, 2007) where linguistic (morphology) features are augmented to the translation model to improve the translation quality, our approach to address the quality problem is based on constructing a list of synchronous morphology constraints between the source and target languages. These constraints are used to generate scores to determine the quality of pivot phrase pairs. However, unlike factored models, we do not use the morphology in generation and the morphology information comes completely from external resources. In addition, since we work in the pivoting space, we only apply the morphology constraints to the connected words between the source and target languages through the pivot language. This guarantees a fundamental level of semantic equivalence before applying the morphology constraints especially if there is distortion between source and target phrases.\nWe build on our approach in El Kholy et al. (2013) where we introduced connectivity strength features between the source and target phrase pairs in the pivot phrase table. These features provide quality scores based on the number of alignment links between words in the source phrase and words in the target phrase. The alignment links are generated by projecting the alignments of the source-pivot phrase pairs and the pivot-target phrase pairs used in pivoting. We use the same concept but instead of using the lexical mapping between source and target words, we compute quality scores based on the morphological compatibility between the connected source and target words.\nTo choose which morphological features to work with, we performed an automatic error analysis on the output of the phrase-pivot baseline system. We did the analysis using AMEANA (El Kholy and Habash, 2011), an open-source error analysis tool for natural language processing tasks targeting morphologically rich languages. We found that the most problematic morphological features in the Arabic output are gender (GEN), number (NUM) and determiner (DET). We focus on those features in addition to (POS) in our experiments.\nNext, we present our approach to generating the morphology constraint features using hand-crafted rules and compare this approach with inducing these constraints from HebrewArabic parallel data."

      "text" : "Our rule-based morphology constraint features are basically a list of hand-crafted mappings of the different morphological features between Hebrew and Arabic. Since both languages are morphologically rich as explained in Section 4, it is straightforward to produce these mappings for GEN, NUM and DET. Note, however, that we also account for ambiguous cases; e.g., feminine gender in Arabic can map to words with ambiguous gender in Hebrew. We additionally use different POS tag sets for Arabic (47 tags) and Hebrew (25 tags) and in many cases one Hebrew tag can map to more than one Arabic tag; for example, three Arabic noun tags abbrev, noun and noun prop map to two Hebrew tags feminine, masculine noun.5 Table 2 shows a sample of the morphological mappings between Arabic and Hebrew.\nAfter building the morphological features mappings, we use them to judge the quality of a given phrase pair in the phrase pivot model. We add two scores Ws and Wt to the log linear space. Given a source-target phrase pair s̄, t̄ and a word projected alignment a between the source word positions i = 1, ..., n and the target word positions j = 1, ...,m, Ws and Wt are defined in equations 1 and 2. F is the set of morphological features (we focus on GEN, NUM, DET and POS). Mf is the hand-crafted rules mapping between Arabic and Hebrew feature values of feature f ∈ F .

Unlike the rule-based approach we build a translation model between the source and target morphological features and we use the morphology translation probabilities as metric to judge a given phrase pair in the pivot phrase table. For the automatically induced constraints, we jointly model mapping between conjunctions of features attached to aligned words rather than tallying each feature match independently. Writing good manual rules for such feature conjunction mappings would be more difficult.

First is the complementary lexical coverage of the direct and pivot systems. This is seen in how one of each covers half of the phrase middlemen and traders. The combined system captures both. Secondly, the gender, number and tense of the main verb prove challenging in many ways (and this is an issue for a majority of the sentences in the Dev set). The Hebrew verb in the present tense is masculine and plural; and naturally follows the subject. The Arabic reference verb appears at the beginning of the sentence, in which location it only agrees with the subject in gender (while number is singular). Arabic Verbs in SVO order agree in gender and number. All the MT systems we compare leave the verb after the subject. The direct, Phrase Pivot+Conn+Morph Auto, and combination systems get the number and gender correctly; however, the direct and combined system make the verb tense past. The Phrase Pivot+Conn+Morph Auto example highlights the value of morphology constraints; but the example points out that they sometimes are hard to evaluate automatically, since there are morphosyntactically allowable forms that do not match the translation references."

One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations especially when a poor morphology language is used as the pivot between rich morphology languages. In this paper, we examine the use of synchronous morphology constraint features to improve the quality of phrase pivot SMT. We compare hand-crafted constraints to those learned from limited parallel data between source and target languages. The learned morphology constraints are based on projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results on Hebrew-Arabic SMT (pivoting on English). We get 1.5 BLEU points over a phrase pivot baseline and 0.8 BLEU points over a system combination baseline with a direct model built from parallel data.",
