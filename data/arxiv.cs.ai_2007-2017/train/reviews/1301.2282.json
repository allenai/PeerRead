Meek (1997) conjectured that this inclusion holds iff there exists a sequence of DAGs from L to K such that only certain 'legal' arrow reversal and 'legal' arrow adding operations are performed to get the next DAG in the sequence.In this paper we give several characterizations of inclusion of DAG models and verify Meek's conjecture in the case that the DAGs K and L differ in at most one adjacency. As a warming up a rigorous proof of well-known graphical characterizations of equivalence of DAGs, which is a highly related problem, is given.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:28 GMT  (1017kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2282v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tomas kocka", "remco r bouckaert", "milan studeny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2282"}
