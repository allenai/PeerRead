      "text" : "Recently, deep learning has been particularly successful in speech and image as an automatic feature extractor (Graves et al., 2013b; Russakovsky et al., 2014; He et al., 2015), however deep learn-\ning’s application to text as an automatic feature extractor has not been always successful (Zhang et al., 2015) even compared to simple linear models with BoW or TF-IDF feature representation. In many experiments when the text is polished like news articles or when the dataset is small, BoW or TF-IDF is still the state-of-art representation compared to sent2vec or paragraph2vec (Le & Mikolov, 2014) representation using deep learning models like RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) or CNN (Convolution Neural Network) (Zhang et al., 2015). It is only when the dataset becomes large or when the words are noisy and non-standardized with misspellings, text emoticons and short-forms that deep learning models which learns the sentence-level semantics start to outperform BoW representation, because under such circumstances, BoW representation can become extremely sparse and the vocabulary size can become huge. It becomes clear that for large, complex data, a large deep learning model with a large capacity can extract a better sentence-level representation than BoW sentence representation. However, for small and standardized news-like dataset, a direct word counting TF-IDF sentence representation is superior. Then the question is can we design a deep learning model that performs well for both simple and complex, small and large datasets? And when the dataset is small and standardized, the deep learning model should perform comparatively well as BoW? With that problem in mind, we designed TDSM (Top-Down-SemanticModel) which learns a sentence representation that carries the information of both the BoW-like representation and RNN style of sentence-level semantic which performs well for both simple and complex, small and large datasets.\nGetting inspiration from the success of TFIDF representation, our model intends to learn a word topic-vector which is similar to TF-IDF vec-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 58\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 M\nay 2\n01 7\ntor of a word but is different from word embedding, whereby the values in the topic-vector are all positives, and each dimension of the topicvector represents a topic aspect of the word. Imagine a topic-vector of representation meaning [animal, temperature, speed], so a rat maybe represented as [0.9, 0.7, 0.2] since rat is an animal with high body temperature but slow running speed compared to a car which maybe represented as [0.1, 0.8, 0.9] for being a non-animal, but high engine temperature and fast speed. A topic-vector will have a much richer semantic meaning than one-hot TF-IDF representation and also, it does not have the cancellation effect of summing wordembeddings positional vectors ([−1, 1]+[1,−1] = [0, 0]). The results from (Johnson & Zhang, 2015) show that by summing word-embedding vectors as sentence representation will have a catastrophic result for text classification.\nKnowing the topic-vector of each word, we can combine the words into a sentence representation s̃ by learning a weight wi for each word vi and do a linear sum of the words, s̃ = ∑ iwiṽi. The weights wi for each word in the sentence summation is learnt by recurrent neural network (RNN) (Pascanu et al., 2013) with attention over the words (Yang et al., 2016). The weights corresponds to the IDF (inverse document frequency) in TF-IDF representation, but with more flexibility and power. IDF is fixed for each word and calculated from all the documents (entire dataset), however attention weights learned from RNN is conditioned on both the document-level and datasetlevel semantics. This sentence representation from topic-vector of each word is then concatenated with the sentence-level semantic vector from RNN to give a top-down sentence representation as illustrated in Figure 2."

      "text" : "TDSM is a framework that can be applied to both word-level or character-level inputs. Here in this paper, we choose character-level over word-level inputs for practical industry reasons.\n1. In industry applications, often the model is required to have continuous learning on datasets that morph over time. Which means the vocabulary may change over time, therefore feeding the dataset by characters dispel the need for rebuilding a new vocabulary every time when there are new words.\n2. Industry datasets are usually very complex and noisy with a large vocabulary, therefore the memory foot-print of storing word embeddings is much larger than character embeddings.\nTherefore improving the performance of a character-based model has a much larger practical value compared to word-based model."

      "text" : "There are many traditional machine learning methods for text classification and most of them could achieve quite good results on formal text datasets. Recently, many deep learning methods have been proposed to solve the text classification task (Zhang et al., 2015; dos Santos & Gatti, 2014; Kim, 2014).\nDeep convolutional neural network has been extremely successful for image classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Sermanet et al., 2013). Recently, many research also tries to apply it on text classification problem. Kim 2014 proposed a model similar to Collobert’s et al. 2011 architecture. However, they employ two channels of word vectors. One is static throughout training and the other is fine-tuned via back-propagation. Various size of filters are applied on both channels, and the outputs are concatenated together. Then max-pooling over time is taken to select the most significant feature among each filter. The selected features are concatenated as the sentence vector.\nSimilarly, Zhang et al. 2015 also employs the convolutional networks but on characters instead of words for text classification. They design two networks for the task, one large and one small. Both of them have nine layers including six convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers. Between the three fully connected layers they insert two dropout layers for regularization. For both convolution and max-pooling layers, they employ 1-D filters (Boureau et al., 2010). After each convolution, they apply 1-D max-pooling. Specially, they claim that 1-D max-pooling enable them to train a relatively deep network.\nBesides applying models directly on testing datasets, more aspects are considered when extracting features. Character-level feature is adopted in many tasks besides Zhang et al. 2015 and most of them achieve quite good performance.\nSantos and Zadrozny 2014 take word morphology and shape into consideration which have been ignored for part-of-speech tagging task. They suggest the intra-word information is extremely useful when dealing with morphologically rich languages. They adopt neural network model to learn the character-level representation which is further delivered to help word embedding learning.\nKim et al. 2015 constructs neural language model by analysis of word representation obtained from character composition. Results suggest that the model could encode semantic and orthographic information from character level.\n(Tang et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016) uses two hierarchies of recurrent neural network to extract\nthe document representation. The lower hierarchical recurrent neural network summarizes a sentence representation from the words in the sentence. The upper hierarchical neural network then summarizes a document representation from the sentences in the document. The major difference between (Tang et al., 2016) and (Yang et al., 2016) is that Yang applies attention over outputs from the recurrent when learning a summarizing representation.\nAttention model is also utilized in our model, which is used to assign weights for each word. Usually, attention is used in sequential model (Rocktäschel et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2016; Kadlec et al., 2016). The at-\ntention mechanism includes sensor, internal state, actions and reward. At each time-step, the sensor will capture a glimpse of the input which is a small part of the entire input. Internal state will summarize the extracted information. Actions will decide the next glimpse location for the next step and reward suggests the benefit when taking the action. In our network, we adopt a simplified attention network as (Raffel & Ellis, 2015, 2016). We learn the weights over the words directly instead of through a sequence of actions and rewards.\nResidual network (He et al., 2015, 2016; Chen et al., 2016) is known to be able to make very deep neural networks by having skip-connections that allows gradient to back-propagate through the skip-connections. Residual network in (He et al., 2015) outperforms the state-of-the-art models on image recognition. He 2016 introduces residual block as similar to feature refinement for image classification. Similarly, for text classification problem, the quality of sentence representation is also quite important for the final result. Thus, we try to adopt the residual block as in (He et al., 2015, 2016) to refine the sentence vector."

      "text" : "Unlike word-embedding (Mikolov et al., 2013), topic-vector tries to learn a distributed topic representation at each dimension of the representation vector, which thus allows the simple addition of the word-level topic-vectors to form a sentence representation. Figure 1 illustrates how topicvector is extracted from characters in words using FCN (Fully Convolutional Network). In order to force word level representation with topic meanings, we apply a sigmoid function over the output from FCN. Doing so, restrain the values at each dimension to be between 0 and 1, thus forcing the model to learn a distributed topic representation of the word."

      "heading" : "3.2 Sentence Representation Vector Construction",
      "text" : "Forming a sentence representation from words can be done simply by summing of the wordembeddings which produce catastrophic results (Johnson & Zhang, 2015) due to the cancellation effect of adding embedding vectors (negative plus positive gives zero). Or in our model, the summing of word-level topic-vectors which give a much bet-\nter sentence representation as shown in Table 3 than summing word-embeddings.\nBoW Features: Sentence vector derived from summing of the word topic-vectors is equivalent to the BoW vectors in word counting, whereby we treat the prior contribution of each word to the final sentence vector equally. Traditionally, a better sentence representation over BoW will be TF-IDF, which gives a weight to each word in a document in terms of IDF (inverse document frequency). Drawing inspiration from TF-IDF representation, we can have a recurrent neural network that outputs the attention (Yang et al., 2016) over the words. And the attention weights serve similar function as the IDF except that it is local to the context of the document, since the attention weight for a word maybe different for different documents while the IDF of a word is the same throughout all documents. With the attention weights wi and word topic-vector ṽi, we can form a sentence vector s̃bow by linear sum\ns̃bow = ∑ i wiṽi (1)\nPositional Features: With the neural sentence vector that derived from BoW which captures the information of individual words. We can also concatenate it with the output state from the RNN which captures the document level information and whose representation is conditioned on the positioning of the words in the document.\ns̃t = RNN(ṽt, s̃t−1) (2)\ns̃pos = s̃T (3) s̃ = s̃bow ⊕ s̃pos (4)\nwhere T is the length of the document, and ⊕ represents concatenation such that |s̃| = |s̃bow| + |s̃pos|. The overall sentence vector s̃ will then capture the information of both the word-level and document-level semantics of the document. And thus it has a very rich representation."

BiLSTM consist of a forward LSTM (FLSTM) and a backward LSTM (BLSTM), both LSTMs are of the same design, except that FLSTM reads the sentence in a forward manner and BLSTM reads the sentence in a backward manner.

Finally, the output from the BiLSTM will be a concatenation of the output from FLSTM and BLSTM\nf̃t = FLSTM(ṽt, s̃t−1) (11)\nb̃t = BLSTM(ṽt, s̃t+1) (12)\nh̃t = f̃t ⊕ b̃t (13)\nHere, the concatenated output state of BiLSTM has visibility of the entire sequence at any timestep compared to single-directional LSTM which only has visibility of the sequence in the past. This property of BiLSTM is very useful for learning attention weights for each word in a document because then the weights are decided based on the information of the entire document instead of just words before it as in LSTM."

The topic-vectors are then linearly sum with attention weights to form a 180 dimensions BoW-like sentence vector. This vector is further concatenate with 200 dimensions BiLSTM outputs.

Unfortunately, (Yang et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016) recurrent models are trained on full text instead of lowered text, so their models may not be objectively compared to our models, since it is well known from (Uysal & Gunal, 2014) that differ-\nent text preprocessing will have significant impact on the final results, Zhang’s result shows that a simple case lowering can result up to 4% difference in classification accuracy.

      "heading" : "5 Results",
      "text" : "Table 3 shows the comparison results of different datasets with different size, different sentence length, and different quality (polished AG news vs messy Yelp and Amazon reviews).\nFrom the results, we see that TDSM outperforms all the other CNN models across all the datasets with only 1% of the parameters of Zhang’s large conv model and 7.8% of his small conv model. Since these results are based on the same text preprocessing and across all kinds of dataset (long, short, large, small, polished, messy), we can confidently say that TDSM generalizes better than the other CNN models over text classification. These results show that a good architecture design can achieve a better accuracy with significantly less parameters.\nCharacter-based models are the most significant and practical model for real large scale industry deployment because of its smaller memory footprint, agnostic to changes in vocabulary and robust to misspellings (Kim et al., 2015). For a very long time, TF-IDF has been state-of-art models especially in small and standardized datasets. However because of its large memory footprint and non-suitability for continuous learning (because a new vocabulary has to be rebuilt every once in awhile when there are new words especially for data source like Tweeter), it was not an ideal model until character-based models came out. From the results, previous character-based models are generally better than TF-IDF for large datasets but falls short for smaller dataset like AG news. TDSM successfully close the gap between character-based models and TF-IDF by beating TF-IDF with 1% better performance. The results also confirm the hypothesis that TDSM as illustrated in Figure 2 which contains both the BoWlike and sentence-level features, has the best of the traditional TF-IDF and the recent deep learning model, is able to perform well for both small and large datasets.\nFrom the results, we also observe that TDSM improves over other character-based models by a big margin of 3% for Lg. Conv and 5.7% for Sm. Conv on the AG dataset. But the improvement tails off to only 0.5% for Amazon reviews when the dataset size increases from 120,000 to 3.6 million. This is probably because TDSM has reached its maximum capacity when the dataset gets very large compared to other character-based models\nwhich have 100 times the capacity of TDSM. For Yelp Full, we observe that the hierarchical recurrent models LSTM-GRNN and HN-ATT performs about 10% points better than TDSM but drops to only 3% for Amazon Full. This may be partly due to their data being prepared differently from our models. This can also be due to the structure of these hierarchical recurrent models which has two levels of recurrent neural networks for summarizing a document, whereby the first level summarizes a sentence vector from the words and the second level summarizes a document vector from the sentences. So these models will start to perform much better when there are alot of sentences and words in a document. For Yelp Full, there are of average 134 words in one document and Amazon Full has about 80 words per document. That’s why the performance is much better for these recurrent models on Yelp than on Amazon. However, these hierarchical recurrent models will be reduce to a purely vanilla RNN for short text like AG News or Tweets with a few sentences, and under such circumstances its result will not be much different from a standard RNN. Nevertheless, LSTM-GRNN or HN-ATT does indicate the strength of RNN models in summarizing the sentences and documents and deriving a coherent sentence-level and document-level representation."

Deep learning tends to emphasize on sentence level semantics when learning a representation with models like recurrent neural network or recursive neural network, however from the success of TF-IDF representation, it seems a bag-of-words type of representation has its strength. Taking advantage of both representions, we present a model known as TDSM (Top Down Semantic Model) for extracting a sentence representation that considers both the word-level semantics by linearly combining the words with attention weights and the sentence-level semantics with BiLSTM and use it on text classification. We apply the model on characters and our results show that our model is better than all the other characterbased and word-based convolutional neural network models by (Zhang et al., 2015) across seven different datasets with only 1% of their parameters. We also demonstrate that this model beats traditional linear models on TF-IDF vectors on small and polished datasets like news article in which typically deep learning models surrender.",
