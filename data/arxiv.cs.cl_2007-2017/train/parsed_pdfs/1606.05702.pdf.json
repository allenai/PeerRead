      "text" : "Social media forums, such as social networks, blogs, newsgroups, and community question answering (QA), offer avenues for people to express their opinions as well collect other people’s thoughts on topics as diverse as health, politics and software (Liu et al., 2008). However, digesting the large amount of information in long threads on newsgroups, or even knowing which threads to pay attention to, can be overwhelming. A text-based summary that highlights the diversity of opinions on a given topic can lighten this information overload. In this work, we design a submodular function-based framework for opinion summarization on community question answering and blog data. Question: What is the long term effect of piracy on the music and film industry? Best Answer: Rising costs for movies and music. ... If they sell less, they need to raise the price to make up for what they lost. The other thing will be music and movies with less quality. ... Other Answers: Ans1: Its bad... really bad. (Just watch this movie and you will find out ... Piracy causes rappers to appear on your computer). Ans2: By removing the profitability of music & film companies, piracy takes away their motivation to produce new music & movies. If they can’t protect their copyrights, they can’t continue to do business. ... Ans4: It is forcing them to rework their business model, which is a good thing. In short, I don’t think the music industry in particular will ever enjoy the huge profits of the 90’s. ... Ans6: Please-People in those businesses make millions of dollars as it is!! I don’t think piracy hurts them at all!!!\nFigure 1: Example discussion on Yahoo! Answers. Besides the best answer, other answers also contain relevant information (in italics). For example, the sentence in blue has a contrasting viewpoint compared to the other answers.\nOpinion summarization has previously been applied to restricted domains, such as product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009) and news (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006), where the output summary is either presented in a structured way with respect to each aspect of the product or organized along contrastive viewpoints. Unlike those works, we address user generated online data: community QA and blogs. These forums use a substantially less formal language than news articles, and at the same time address a much broader spectrum of topics than product reviews. As a result, they present new challenges for automatic summarization. For example, Figure 1 illustrates a sample question from Yahoo! Answers1 along with the answers from different users. The question receives more than one answer, and one of them is selected as the “best answer” by the asker or other participants. In general, answers from other users also provide relevant information. While community QA successfully pools rich knowledge from the wisdom of the crowd, users might need to seine through numerous posts to extract the information\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Hence, it would be beneficial to summarize answers automatically and present the summaries to users who ask similar questions in the future. In this work, we aim to return a summary that encapsulates different perspectives for a given opinion question and a set of relevant answers or documents.\nIn our work we assume that there is a central topic (or query) on which a user is seeking diverse opinions. We predict query-relevance through automatically learned statistical rankers. Our ranking function not only aims to find sentences that are on the topic of the query but also ones that are “opinionated” through the use of several features that indicate subjectivity and sentiment. The relevance score is encoded in a submodular function. Diversity is accounted for by a dispersion function that maximizes the pairwise distance between the pairs of sentences selected.\nOur chief contributions are: (1) We develop a submodular function-based framework for query-focused opinion summarization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that submodular functions have been used to support opinion summarization. We test our framework on two tasks: summarizing opinionated sentences in community QA (Yahoo! Answers) and blogs (TAC-2008 corpus). Human evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk shows that our system generates the best summary 57.1% of the time. On the other hand, the best answer picked by Yahoo! users is chosen only 31.9% of the time. We also obtain significant higher Pyramid F1 score on the blog task as compared to the system of Lin and Bilmes (2011). (2) Within our summarization framework, the statistically learned sentence relevance is included as part of our objective function, whereas previous work on submodular summarization (Lin and Bilmes, 2011) only uses ngram overlap for query relevance. Additionally, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Blei et al., 2003) to model the topic structure of the sentences, and induce clusterings according to the learned topics. Therefore, our system is capable of generating summaries with broader topic coverage. (3) Furthermore, we are the first to study how different metrics for computing text similarity or dissimilarity affect the quality of submodularity-based summarization methods. We show empirically that lexical representation-based similarity, such as TFIDF scores, uniformly outperforms semantic similarity computed with WordNet. Moreover, when measuring the summary diversity, topical representation is marginally better than lexical representation, and both of them beats semantic representation."

      "text" : "Our work falls in the realm of query-focused summarization, where a user asks a question and the system generates a summary of the answers containing pertinent and diverse information. A wide range of methods have been investigated, where relevance is often estimated through TF-IDF similarity (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), topic signature words (Lin and Hovy, 2000) or by learning a Bayesian model over queries and documents (Daumé and Marcu, 2006). Most work only implicitly penalizes summary redundancy, e.g. by downweighting the importance of words that are already selected.\nEncouraging diversity of a summary has recently been addressed through submodular functions, which have been applied for multi-document summarization in newswire (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Sipos et al., 2012), and comments summarization (Dasgupta et al., 2013). However, these works either ignore the query information (when available) or else use simple ngram matching between the query and sentences. In contrast, we propose to optimize an objective function that addresses both relevance and diversity.\nPrevious work on generating opinion summaries mainly considers product reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Lerman et al., 2009), and formal texts such as news articles (Stoyanov and Cardie, 2006) or editorials (Paul et al., 2010). Mostly, there is no query information, and summaries are formulated in a structured way based on product features or contrastive standpoints. Our work is more related to opinion summarization on user-generated content, such as community QA. Liu et al. (2008) manually construct taxonomies for questions in community QA. Summaries are generated by clustering sentences according to their polarity based on a small dictionary. Tomasoni and Huang (2010) introduce coverage and quality constraints on the sentences, and utilize an integer linear programming framework to select sentences."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe how query-focused opinion summarization can be addressed by submodular functions combined with dispersion functions. We first define our problem. Then we introduce the\ncomponents of our objective function (Sections 3.1–3.3). The full objective function is presented in Section 3.4. Lastly, we describe a greedy algorithm with constant factor approximation to the optimal solution for generating summaries (Section 3.5).\nA set of documents or answers to be summarized are first split into a set of individual sentences V = {s1, · · · , sn}. Our problem is to select a subset S ⊆ V that maximizes a given objective function f : 2V → R within a length constraint: S∗ = argmax\nS⊆V\nf(S), subject to | S |≤ c. | S | is the length of\nthe summary S, and c is the length limit.\nDefinition 1 A function f : 2V → R is submodular iff for all s ∈ V and every S ⊆ S′ ⊆ V , it satisfies f(S ∪ {s})− f(S) ≥ f(S′ ∪ {s})− f(S′).\nPrevious submodularity-based summarization work assumes this diminishing return property makes submodular functions a natural fit for summarization and achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets. In this paper, we follow the same assumption and work with non-decreasing submodular functions. Nevertheless, they have limitations, one of which is that functions well suited to modeling diversity are not submodular. Recently, Dasgupta et al. (2013) proved that diversity can nonetheless be encoded in well-designed dispersion functions which still maintain a constant factor approximation when solved by a greedy algorithm.\nBased on these considerations, we propose an objective function f(S) mainly considering three aspects: relevance (Section 3.1), coverage (Section 3.2), and non-redundancy (Section 3.3). Relevance and coverage are encoded in a non-decreasing submodular function, and non-redundancy is enforced by maximizing the dispersion function."

We choose ListNet (Cao et al., 2007), which has been shown to be effective in many information retrieval tasks, as our ranker. We use the implementation from Ranklib (Dang, 2011).\nFeatures used in the ranking algorithm are summarized in Table 1. All features are normalized by standardization. Due to the length limit, we cannot provide the full results on feature evaluation. Nevertheless, we find that ranking candidates by TFIDF similarity or key phrases overlapping with the query can produce comparable results with using the full feature set (see Section 5).\nWe take the ranks output by the ranker, and define the relevance of the current summary S as: r(S) = ∑|S|\ni\n√\nrank−1i , where ranki is the rank of sentence si in V . For QA answer ranking, sentences from the same answer have the same ranking. The function r(S) is our first submodular function."

      "heading" : "3.2 Coverage Functions",
      "text" : "Topic Coverage. This function is designed to capture the idea that a comprehensive opinion summary should provide thoughts on distinct aspects. Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants are able to discover hidden topics or aspects of document collections, and thus afford a natural way to cluster texts according to their topics. Recent work (Xie and Xing, 2013) shows the effectiveness of utilizing topic models for newsgroup document clustering. We first learn an LDA model from the data, and treat each topic as a cluster. We estimate a sentence-topic distribution ~θ for each sentence, and assign the sentence to the cluster k corresponding to the mode of the distribution (i.e., k = argmaxi θi). This naive approach produces comparable clustering performance to the state-of-the-art according to (Xie and Xing, 2013). T is defined as the clustering induced by our algorithm on the set V . The topic coverage of the current summary S is defined as t(S) = ∑\nT∈T\n√\n|S ∩ T |.\nFrom the concavity of the square root it follows that sets S with uniform coverages of topics are preferred to sets with skewed coverage. Authorship Coverage. This term encourages the summarization algorithm to select sentences from different authors. Let A be the clustering induced by the sentence to author relation. In community QA, sentences from the answers given by the same user belong to the same cluster. Similarly, sentences from blogs with the same author are in the same cluster. The authorship score is defined as a(S) = ∑\nA∈A\n√\n|S ∩A|. Polarity Coverage. The polarity score encourages the selection of summaries that cover both positive and negative opinions. We categorize each sentence simply by counting the number of polarized words given by our lexicon. A sentence belongs to a positive cluster if it has more positive words than negative ones, and vice versa. If any negator co-occurs with a sentiment word (e.g. within a window of size 5), the sentiment is reversed.2 The polarity clustering P thus have two clusters corresponding to positive and negative opinions. The score is defined as p(S) = ∑\nP∈P\n√\n| S ∩ P |. Our lexicon consists of MPQA lexicon (Wilson et al., 2005), General Inquirer (Stone et al., 1966), and SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani, 2006). Words with conflicting sentiments from different lexicons are removed. Content Coverage. Similarly to Lin and Bilmes (2011) and Dasgupta et al. (2013), we use the following function to measure content coverage of the current summary S: c(S) = ∑\nv∈V min(cov(v, S), θ · cov(v, V )), where cov(v, S) = ∑\nu∈S sim(v, u). We experiment with two types of similarity functions. One is a Cosine TFIDF similarity score. The other is a WordNet-based semantic similarity score between pairwise dependency relations from two sentences (Dasgupta et al., 2013). Specifically, simSem(v, u) = ∑\nreli∈v,relj∈u WN(ai, aj) × WN(bi, bj), where reli = (ai, bi), relj = (aj , bj), WN(wi, wj) is the\nshortest path length. All scores are scaled onto [0, 1]."

      "text" : "Summaries should contain as little redundant information as possible. We achieve this by adding an additional term to the objective function, encoded by a dispersion function. Given a set of sentences S, a complete graph is constructed with each sentence in S as a node. The weight of each edge (u, v) is their dissimilarity d′(u, v). Then the distance between any pair of u and v, d(u, v), is defined as the total weight of the shortest path connecting u and v.3 We experiment with two forms of dispersion function (Dasgupta et al., 2013): (1) hsum = ∑\nu,v∈V,u 6=v d(u, v), and (2) hmin = minu,v∈V,u 6=v d(u, v). Then we need to define the dissimilarity function d′(·, ·). There are different ways to measure the dissimilarity between sentences (Mihalcea et al., 2006; Agirre et al., 2012). In this work, we experiment with three types of dissimilarity functions. Lexical Dissimilarity. This function is based on the well-known Cosine similarity score using TFIDF weights. Let simtfidf (u, v) be the Cosine similarity between u and v, then we have d′Lex(u, v) = 1− simtfidf (u, v). Semantic Dissimilarity. This function is based on the semantic meaning embedded in the dependency relations. d′Sem(u, v) = 1 − simSem(v, u), where simSem(v, u) is the semantic similarity used in content coverage measurement in Section 3.2. Topical Dissimilarity. We propose a novel dissimilarity measure based on topic models. Celikyilmaz et al. (2010) show that estimating the similarity between query and passages by using topic structures can help improve the retrieval performance. As discussed in the topic coverage in Section 3.2, each sentence is represented by its sentence-topic distributions estimated by LDA. For candidate sentence u and v, let their topic distributions be Pu and Pv. Then the dissimilarity between u and v can be defined as: d′Topic(u, v) = JSD(Pu||Pv) = 12 ( ∑ i Pu(i) log2 Pu(i) Pa(i) + ∑ i Pv(i) log2 Pv(i) Pa(i) ) where Pa(i) = 12 (Pu(i) + Pv(i))."

      "text" : "Automatic Evaluation. Since human written abstracts are not available for the Yahoo! Answers dataset, we adopt the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) to measure the summary quality. Intuitively, a smaller JSD implies that the summary covers more of the content in the answer set. Louis and Nenkova (2013) report that JSD has a strong negative correlation (Spearman correlation = −0.737) with the overall summary quality for multi-document summarization (MDS) on news articles and blogs. Our task is similar to MDS. Meanwhile, the average JSD of the best answers in our test set is smaller than that of the other answers (0.39 vs. 0.49), with an average length of 103 words compared with 67 words for the other answers. Also, on the blog task (Section 5.3), the top two systems by JSD also have the top two ROUGE scores (a common metric for summarization evaluation when human-constructed summaries are available). Thus, we conjecture that JSD is a good metric for community QA summaries.\nTable 3 (left) shows that our system using a content coverage function based on Cosine using TFIDF weights, and a dispersion function (hsum) based on lexicon dissimilarity and 100 topics, outperforms all of the compared approaches (paired-t test, p < 0.05). The topic number is tuned on the development set, and we find that varying the number of topics does not impact performance too much. Meanwhile, both our system and Dasgupta et al. (2013) produce better JSD scores than the two variants of the Lin and Bilmes (2011) system, which implies the effectiveness of the dispersion function. We further examine the effectiveness of each component that contributes to the objective function (Section 3.4), and the results are shown in Table 3 (right).\nHuman Evaluation. Human evaluation for Yahoo! Answers is carried out on Amazon Mechanical Turk6 with carefully designed tasks (or “HITs”). Turkers are presented summaries from different systems in a random order, and asked to provide two rankings, one for overall quality and the other for information diversity. We indicate that informativeness and non-redundancy are desirable for quality; however, Turkers are allowed to consider other desiderata, such as coherence or responsiveness, and write down those when they submit the answers. Here we believe that ranking the summaries is easier than evaluating each summary in isolation (Lerman et al., 2009).\n6https://www.mturk.com/mturk/\nWe randomly select 100 questions from our test set, each of which is evaluated by 4 distinct Turkers located in United States. 40 HITs are thus created, each containing 10 different questions. Four system summaries (best answer, Dasgupta et al. (2013), and our system with 100 and 200 words respectively) are displayed along with one noisy summary (i.e. irrelevant to the question) per question in random order.7 We reject Turkers’ HITs if they rank the noisy summary higher than any other. Two duplicate questions are added to test intra-annotator agreement. We reject HITs if Turkers produced inconsistent rankings for both duplicate questions. A total of 137 submissions of which 40 HITs pass the above quality filters.\nTurkers of all accepted submissions report themselves as native English speakers. An inter-rater agreement of Fleiss’ κ of 0.28 (fair agreement (Landis and Koch, 1977)) is computed for quality ranking and κ is 0.43 (moderate agreement) for diversity ranking. Table 4 shows the percentage of times a particular method is picked as the best summary, and the macro-/micro-average rank of a method, for both overall quality and information diversity. Macro-average is computed by first averaging the ranks per question and then averaging across all questions.\nFor overall quality, our system with a 200 word limit is selected as the best in 44.6% of the evaluations. It outperforms the best answer (31.9%) significantly, which suggests that our system summary covers relevant information that is not contained in the best answer. Our system with a length constraint of 100 words is chosen as the best for quality 12.5% times while that of Dasgupta et al. (2013) is chosen 11.0% of the time. Our system is also voted as the best summary for diversity in 78.7% of the evaluations. More interestingly, both of our systems, with 100 words and 200 words, outperform the best answer and Dasgupta et al. (2013) for average ranking (both overall quality and information diversity) significantly by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.05). When we check the reasons given by Turkers, we found that people usually prefer our summaries due to “helpful suggestions that covered many options” or being “balanced with different opinions”. When Turks prefer the best answers, they mostly stress on coherence and responsiveness. Sample summaries from all the systems are displayed in Figure 2.\n7Note that we aim to compare results with the gold-standard best answers of about 100 words.

Results on Yahoo! Answer (Table 6 (left)) show that systems using summation of distances for dispersion functions (hsum) uniformly outperform the ones using minimum distance (hmin). Meanwhile, Cosine using TFIDF is better at measuring content coverage than WordNetbased semantic measurement, and this may due to the limited coverage of WordNet on verbs. This is also true for dissimilarity metrics. Results on blog data (Table 6 (right)), however, show that using minimum distance for dispersion produces better results.

Within our framework, relevance ordering produced by a statistical ranker, and information coverage with respect to topic distribution and diverse viewpoints are both encoded as submodular functions. Dispersion functions are utilized to minimize the redundancy. We are the first to evaluate different metrics of text similarity for submodularity-based summarization methods. By experimenting on community QA and blog summarization, we show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. A human evaluation task is conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk with scale, and shows that our systems are able to generate summaries of high overall quality and information diversity.",
