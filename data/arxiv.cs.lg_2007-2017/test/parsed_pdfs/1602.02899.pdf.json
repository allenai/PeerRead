      "text" : "The main purpose of machine learning can be expressed as to find the patterns and summarize the data form of high-dimensional data sets. The classification algorithms [1,2] is one of the most widely used method of machine learning in real-life problems. Data sets used in real-life problems are high dimensional as a result, analysis of them is a complicated process.\nExtreme Learning Machine (ELM) was proposed by [3] based on generalized Single-hidden Layer Feed-forward Networks (SLFNs). Main characteristics of ELM are small training time compared to traditional gradient-based learning methods, high generalization property on predicting unseen examples with multiclass labels and parameter free with randomly generated hidden nodes.\nBackground knowledge attack uses quasi-identifier attributes of a dataset and reduce the possible values of output sensitive information. A well-known\nexample about background knowledge attack is the personal health information about of Massachusetts governor William Weld using a anonymized data set [4]. In order to overcome these types of attacks, various anonymization methods have been developed like k -anonymity [4], l -diversity [5], t -closeness [6].\nAlthough the anonymization methods are applied to data sets to protect sensitive data, though, the sensitive data is still accessed by an attacker in various ways [7]. Also, data anonymization methods are not applicable in some cases. In another scenario, consider the situation when two or more hospitals wants to analyze patient data [8] through collaborative processes that require using each other’s databases. In such cases, it is necessary to find a secure training method that can run jointly on private union databases, without revealing or pooling their sensitive data. Privacy-preserving ELM learning systems are one of the methods that the only information learned by the different parties is the output model of learning method.\nIn this research, we propose a privacy-preserving ELM training model that constructs the global ELM classification model from the distributed data sets in multiple parties. The training data set is vertically partitioned among the parties, and the final distributed model is constructed at an independent party to securely predict the correct label for the new input data.\nThe content of this paper is as follows: Related work is reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, ELM, secure multi-party computation and the secure addition are explained. In section 4, our new privacy-preserving ELM for vertically partitioned data is proposed. Section 5 emprically shows the timing results of our method with different public data sets."

      "text" : "In this section, we review the existing works that have been developed for different machine learning methods. The major differences between our learning model and existing work are highlighted.\nRecently, there has been significant contributions in privacy-preserving machine learning. Secretans et al. [9] presents a probabilistic neural network (PNN) model. The PNN is an approximation of the theoretically optimal classifier, known as the Bayesian optimal classifier. There are at least three parties involved in the computation of the secure matrix summation to add the partial class conditional probability vectors together. Aggarwal et al. [10] developed condensation based learning method. They show that an anonymized data closely matches the characteristics of the original data. Samet et al. [11] present new privacy-preserving protocols for both the back-propagation and ELM algorithms among several parties. The protocols are presented for perceptron learning algorithm and applied only single layer models. Oliveria et al. [12] proposed methods distort confidential numerical features to protect privacy for clustering analysis. Guang et al. [13] proposed a privacy-preserving back-propagation algorithm for horizontally partitioned databases for multi-party case. They use secure sum in their protocols. Yu et al. [14] proposed a privacy-preserving solution for support\nvector machine classification. Their approach constructs the global SVM classification model from the data distributed at multiple parties, without disclosing the data of each party to others."

      "text" : "ELM was originally proposed for the single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks [15,16,3] . Then, ELM was extended to the generalized single-hidden layer feed-forward networks where the hidden layer may not be neuron like [17,18]. Main advantages of ELM classification algorithm is that ELM can be trained hundred times faster than traditional neural network or support vector machine algorithm since its input weights and hidden node biases are randomly created and output layer weights can be analytically calculated by using a least-squares method [19,20]. The most noticeable feature of ELM is that its hidden layer parameters are selected randomly.\nGiven a set of training data D = {(xi, yi) | i = 1, ..., n},xi ∈ R p, yi ∈ {1, 2, ...,K}} sampled independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some unknown distribution. The goal of a neural network is to learn a function f : X → Y where X is instances and Y is the set of all possible labels. The output label of an single hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNs) with N hidden nodes can be described as\nfN (x) = N ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x), x ∈ R n, ai ∈ R n (1)\nwhere ai and bi are the learning parameters of hidden nodes and βi is the weight connecting the ith hidden node to the output node. The output function of ELM for generalized SLFNs can be identified by\nfN (x) =\nN ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x) = β × h(x) (2)\nFor the binary classification applications, the decision function of ELM becomes\nfN(x) = sign\n(\nN ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x)\n)\n= sign (β × h(x)) (3)\nEquation 2 can be written in another form as\nHβ = T (4)\nH and T are respectively hidden layer matrix and output matrix.\nβ = H†T (5)\nH† is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of matrix H. Hidden layer matrix can be described as\nH(ã, b̃, x̃) =\n\n  G(a1, b1, x1) · · · G(aL, bL, x1) ... . . . ...\nG(a1, b1, xN ) · · · G(aL, bL, xN )\n\n \nN×L\n(6)\nwhere ã = a1, ..., aL, b̃ = b1, ..., bL, x̃ = x1, ..., xN .

Classification models of each data set are compared for accuracy results without using secure multi-party computation.\nExperimental setup : In this section, our approach is applied to six different data sets to verify model affectivity and efficiency. The data sets are summarized in Table 1, including australian, colon-cancer, diabetes, duke, heart, ionosphere. For each data set in Table 1, we vary number of party size, k from 2 to number\nof feature, n, of the data set. For instance, when our party size is three, k = 3, and attribute size fourteen, n = 14, then the first two party have 5 attributes, and last party has 4 attributes.\nSimulation Results: The accuracy of secure multi-party computation based ELM is exactly same for the traditional ELM training algorithm. Figure 2 shows results of our simulations. As shown in figure, time scale becomes its steady state position when number of parties, k, moves closer to number of attributes, k."

    "abstractText" : "Especially in the Big Data era, the usage of different classification methods is increasing day by day. The success of these classification methods depends on the effectiveness of learning methods. Extreme learning machine (ELM) classification algorithm is a relatively new learning method built on feed-forward neural-network. ELM classification algorithm is a simple and fast method that can create a model from high-dimensional data sets. Traditional ELM learning algorithm implicitly assumes complete access to whole data set. This is a major privacy concern in most of cases. Sharing of private data (i.e. medical records) is prevented because of security concerns. In this research, we propose an efficient and secure privacy-preserving learning algorithm for ELM classification over data that is vertically partitioned among several parties. The new learning method preserves the privacy on numerical attributes, builds a classification model without sharing private data without disclosing the data of each party to others.",
