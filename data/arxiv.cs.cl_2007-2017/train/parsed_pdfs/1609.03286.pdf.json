      "text" : "In the past decade, goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems (SDS), such as the virtual personal assis-\ntants Microsoft’s Cortana and Apple’s Siri, are being incorporated in various devices and allow users to speak to systems freely in order to finish tasks more efficiently. A key component of these conversational systems is the natural language understanding (NLU) module-it refers to the targeted understanding of human speech directed at machines (Tur and De Mori, 2011). The goal of such “targeted” understanding is to convert the recognized user speech into a task-specific semantic representation of the user’s intention, at each turn, that aligns with the back-end knowledge and action sources for task completion. The dialogue manager then interprets the semantics of the user’s request and associated back-end results, and decides the most appropriate system action, by exploiting semantic context and user specific meta-information, such as geo-location and personal preferences (McTear, 2004; Rudnicky and Xu, 1999).\nA typical pipeline of NLU includes: domain classification, intent determination, and slot filling (Tur and De Mori, 2011). NLU first decides the domain of user’s request given the input utterance, and based on the domain, predicts the intent and fills associated slots corresponding to a domain-specific semantic template. For example, Figure 1 shows a user utterance, “show me the flights from seattle to san francisco” and its semantic frame, find flight(origin=“seattle”, dest=“san francisco”). It is easy to see the relationship between the origin city and the destination city in this example, although these do not appear next to each other. Traditionally, domain detection and intent prediction are framed as utterance classification ar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n03 28\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nSe p"

      "text" : "problems, where several classifiers such as support vector machines and maximum entropy have been employed (Haffner et al., 2003; Chelba et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2014). Then slot filling is framed as a word sequence tagging task, where the IOB (in-outbegin) format is applied for representing slot tags as illustrated in Figure 1, and hidden Markov models (HMM) or conditional random fields (CRF) have been employed for slot tagging (Pieraccini et al., 1992; Wang et al., 2005).\nWith the advances on deep learning, deep belief networks (DBNs) with deep neural networks (DNNs) have been applied to domain and intent classification tasks (Sarikaya et al., 2011; Tur et al., 2012; Sarikaya et al., 2014). Recently, Ravuri and Stolcke (2015) proposed an RNN architecture for intent determination. For slot filling, deep learning has been viewed as a feature generator and the neural architecture can be merged with CRFs (Xu and Sarikaya, 2013). Yao et al. (2013) and Mesnil et al. (2015) later employed RNNs for sequence labeling in order to perform slot filling. However, the above studies benefit from large training data without leveraging any existing knowledge. When tagging sequences RNNs consider them as flat structures, with their underlying linear chain structures, potentially ignoring the structured information typical of natural language sequences.\nHierarchical structures and semantic relationships contain linguistic characteristics of input word sequences forming sentences, and such information may help interpret their meaning. Furthermore, prior knowledge would help in the tagging of sequences, especially when dealing with previously unseen sequences (Tur et al., 2010; Deoras and Sarikaya, 2013). Prior work exploited external web-scale knowledge graphs such as Freebase and Wikipedia for improving NLU (Heck et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2015b; Chen et al., 2014) Liu et al. (2013) and Chen et al. (2015) proposed approaches that leverage linguistic knowledge encoded in parse trees for language understanding, where the ex-\ntracted syntactic structural features and semantic dependency features enhance inference model learning, and the model achieves better language understanding performance in various domains.\nEven with the emerging paradigm of integrating deep learning and linguistic knowledge for different NLP tasks (Socher et al., 2014), most of the previous work utilized such linguistic knowledge and knowledge bases as additional features as input to neural networks, and then learned the models for tagging sequences. These feature enrichment based approaches have some possible limitations: 1) poor generalization and 2) error propagation. Poor generalization comes from the mismatch between knowledge bases and the input data, and then the incorrectly extracted features due to errors in previous processing propagate errors to the neural models. In order to address the issues and better learn the sequence tagging models, this paper proposes knowledge-guided structural attention networks, K-SAN, a generalization of RNNs that automatically learn the attention guided by external or prior knowledge and generate sentence-based representations specifically for modeling sequence tagging. The main difference between K-SAN and previous approaches is that knowledge plays the role of a teacher to guide networks where and how much to focus attention considering the whole linguistic structure simultaneously. Our main contributions are three-fold:\n• End-to-end learning To our knowledge, this is the first neural network approach that utilizes general knowledge as guidance in an end-to-end fashion, where the model automatically learns important substructures with an attention mechanism.\n• Generalization for different knowledge There is no required schema of knowledge, and different types of parsing results, such as dependency relations, knowledge graph-specific relations, and parsing output of hand-crafted grammars, can serve as the knowledge guidance in this model.\n• Efficiency and parallelizability Because the substructures from the input utterance are modeled separately, modeling time\nmay not increase linearly with respect to the number of words in the input sentence.\nIn the following sections, we empirically show the benefit of K-SAN on the targeted NLU task."

      "text" : "Knowledge-Based Representations There is an emerging trend of learning representations at different levels, such as word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), character embeddings (Ling et al., 2015), and sentence embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Huang et al., 2013). In addition to fully unsupervised embedding learning, knowledge bases have been widely utilized to learn entity embeddings with specific functions or relations (Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2015; Yang et al., 2014). Different from prior work, this paper focuses on learning composable substructure embeddings that are informative for understanding.\nRecently linguistic structures are taken into account in the deep learning framework. Ma et al. (2015a) and Tai et al. (2015) both proposed dependency-based approaches to combine deep learning and linguistic structures, where the model used tree-based n-grams instead of surface ones to capture knowledge-guided relations for sentence modeling and classification. Roth and Lapata (2016) utilized lexicalized dependency paths to learn embedding representations for semantic role labeling. However, the performance of these approaches highly depends on the quality of “whole” sentence parsing, and there is no control of degree of attentions on different substructures. Learning robust representations incorporating whole structures still remains unsolved. In this paper, we address the limitation by proposing K-SAN to learn robust representations of whole sentences, where the whole representation is composed of the salient substructures in order to avoid error propagation.\nNeural Attention and Memory Model One of the earliest work with a memory component applied to language processing is memory networks (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), which encode facts into vectors and store them in the memory for question answering (QA). Following their success, Xiong et al. (2016) proposed dynamic memory networks (DMN) to additionally capture position and\ntemporality of transitive reasoning steps for different QA tasks. The idea is to encode important knowledge and store it into memory for future usage with attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms allow neural network models to selectively pay attention to specific parts. There are also various tasks showing the effectiveness of attention mechanisms.\nHowever, most previous work focused on the classification or prediction tasks (predicting a single word given a question), and there are few studies for NLU tasks (slot tagging). Based on the fact that the linguistic or knowledge-based substructures can be treated as prior knowledge to benefit language understanding, this work borrows the idea from memory models to improve NLU. Unlike the prior NLU work that utilized representations learned from knowledge bases to enrich features of the current sentence, this paper directly learns a sentence representation incorporating memorized substructures with an automatically decided attention mechanism in an end-to-end manner."

The proposed model is illustrated in Figure 2. The knowledge encoding module first leverages external knowledge to generate a linguistic structure for the utterance, where a discrete set of knowledge-guided substructures {xi} is encoded into a set of vector representations (§ 3.1). The model learns the representation for the whole sentence by paying different attention on the substructures (§ 3.2).

This paper takes dependency relations as an example for knowledge encoding, and other structured relations\ncan be applied in the same way. The input utterance is parsed by a dependency parser, and the substructures are built according to the paths from the root to all leaves (Chen and Manning, 2014). For example, the dependency parsing of the utterance “show me the flights from seattle to san francisco” is shown in Figure 3, where the associated substructures are obtained from the parsing tree for knowledge encoding. Here we do not utilize the dependency relation labels in the experiments for better generalization, because the labels may not be always available for different knowledge resources. Note that the number of substructures may be less than the number of words in the utterance, because non-leaf nodes do not have corresponding substructure in order to reduce the duplicated information in the model. The top-left component of Figure 2 illustrates the module for modeling knowledge-guided substructures."

      "text" : "The model embeds all knowledge-guided substructures into a continuous space and stores embeddings of all x’s in the knowledge memory. The representation of the input utterance is then compared with encoded knowledge representations to integrate the carried structure guided by knowledge via an attention mechanism. Then the knowledge-guided representation of the sentence is taken together with the word sequence for estimating the semantic tags. Four main procedures are described below.\nEncoded Knowledge Representation To store the knowledge-guided structure, we convert each substructure (e.g. path starting from the root to the leaf in the dependency tree), xi, into a structure vectormi with dimension d by embedding the substructure in a continuous space through the knowledge encoding model Mkg. The input utterance s is also embedded to a vector u with the same dimension through the model Min.\nmi = Mkg(xi), (1)\nu = Min(s). (2)\nWe apply the three types for knowledge encoding models, Mkg and Min, in order to model multiple words from a substructure xi or an input sentence s into a vector representation: 1) fully-connected neural networks (NN) with linear activation, 2) recur-\nrent neural networks (RNN), and 3) convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a window size 3 and a max-pooling operation. For example, one of substructures shown in Figure 3, “show flights seattle from”, is encoded into a vector embedding. In the experiments, the weights ofMkg andMin are tied together based on their consistent ability of sequence encoding.\nKnowledge Attention Distribution In the embedding space, we compute the match between the current utterance vector u and its substructure vector mi by taking their inner product followed by a softmax.\npi = softmax(uTmi), (3) where softmax(zi) = ezi/ ∑ j e zj and pi can be viewed as attention distribution for modeling important substructures from external knowledge in order to understand the current utterance.\nSentence Representation In order to encode the knowledge-guided structure, a vector h is a sum over the encoded knowledge embeddings weighted by the attention distribution.\nh = ∑ i pimi, (4)\nwhich indicates that the sentence pays different attention to different substructures guided from external knowledge. Because the function from input to output is smooth, we can easily compute gradients and back propagate through it. Then the sum of the substructure vector h and the current input embedding u are then passed through a neural network modelMout to generate an output knowledge-guided representation o.\no =Mout(h+ u), (5)\nwhere we employ a fully-connected dense network for Mout.\nSequence Tagging To estimate the tag sequence ~y corresponding to an input word sequence ~s, we use an RNN module for training a slot tagger, where the knowledge-guided representation o is fed into the input of the model in order to incorporate the structure information.\n~y = RNN(o,~s) (6)"

We use the Elman RNN architecture, consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer (Elman, 1990). The input, hidden and output layers consist of a set of neurons representing the input, hidden, and output at each time step t, wt, ht, and yt, respectively.\nht = φ(Wwt + Uht−1), (7)\nŷt = softmax(V ht), (8)\nwhere φ is a smooth bounded function such as tanh, and ŷt is the probability distribution over of semantic tags given the current hidden state ht. The sequence probability can be formulated as\np(~y | ~s) = p(~y | w1, ..., wT ) = ∏ i p(yi | w1, ..., wi). (9) The model can be trained using backpropagation to maximize the conditional likelihood of the training set labels.\nTo overcome the frequent vanishing gradients issue when modeling long-term dependencies, gated RNN was designed to use a more sophisticated activation function than a usual activation function, consisting of affine transformation followed by a simple element-wise nonlinearity by using gating units (Chung et al., 2014), such as long shortterm memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014). RNNs employing either of these recurrent units have been shown to perform well in tasks that require capturing long-term dependencies (Mesnil et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2014; Graves et al., 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014). In this paper, we use RNN with GRU cells to allow each recurrent unit to adaptively capture dependencies of different time scales (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014), because RNN-GRU can yield comparable performance as RNN-LSTM with need of fewer parameters and less data for generalization (Chung et al., 2014)\nA GRU has two gates, a reset gate r, and an update gate z (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014). The reset gate determines the combination between\nthe new input and the previous memory, and the update gate decides how much the unit updates its activation, or content.\nr = σ(W rwt + U rht−1), (10) z = σ(W zwt + U zht−1), (11)\nwhere σ is a logistic sigmoid function. Then the final activation of the GRU at time t, ht, is a linear interpolation between the previous activation ht−1 and the candidate activation h̃t:\nht = (1− z) h̃t + z ht−1, (12) h̃t = φ(W hwt + U h(ht−1 r))), (13)\nwhere is an element-wise multiplication. When the reset gate is off, it effectively makes the unit act as if it is reading the first symbol of an input sequence, allowing it to forget the previously computed state. Then ŷt can be computed by (8)."

When comparing the NLU performance between baselines and other state-of-the-art structural models, there is no significant difference. This suggests that encoding sentence information without distinguishing substructure may not capture salient semantics in order to improve understanding performance.\nAmong the proposed K-SAN models, CNN for encoding performs best on Small (75% on F1) and Medium (88% on F1), and RNN for encoding performs best on the Large set (95% on F1). Also, most of the proposed models outperform all baselines, where the improvement for the small dataset is more significant.

Below we compare two types of knowledge formats: dependency tree and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). AMR is a semantic formalism in which the meaning of a sentence is encoded as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph (Banarescu et al., 2013), where nodes represent concepts, and labeled directed edges represent the relations between two concepts. The formalism is based on propositional logic and neoDavidsonian event representations (Parsons, 1990; Davidson, 1967). The semantic concepts in AMR were leveraged to benefit multiple NLP tasks (Liu et al., 2015). Unlike syntactic information from dependency trees, the AMR graph contains semantic information, which may offer more specific conceptual relations. Figure 6 shows the comparison of a dependency tree and an AMR graph associated with the same example utterance and how the knowledgeguided substructures are constructed.\nTable 2 presents the performance of CRF and K-SAN with CNN taggers that utilize dependency relations and AMR edges as knowledge guidance on the same datasets, where CRF takes the\nSentence s\nshow me the flights from seattle to san francisco\nSentence s\nshow me the flights from seattle to san francisco\nhead words from either dependency trees or AMR graphs as additional features and K-SAN incorporates knowledge-guided substructures as illustrated in Figure 6. The dependency trees are obtained from the Stanford dependency parser or the SyntaxNet parser2, and AMR graphs are generated by a rulebased AMR parser or JAMR3.\nAmong four knowledge resources (different types and obtained from different parsers), all results show the similar performance for three sizes of datasets. The maximum number of substructures for the dependency tree is larger than the number in the AMR graph (53 and 25 v.s. 19 and 8), because syntax is more general and may provide richer cues for guiding more attention while semantics is more specific and may offer stronger guidance.

Recently recurrent neural networks (RNN) obtained strong results on NLU due to their superior ability of preserving sequential information over time. Traditionally, the NLU module tags semantic slots for utterances considering their flat structures, as the underlying RNN structure is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits linguistic properties that provide rich, structured information for better understanding. This paper introduces a novel model, knowledge-guided structural attention networks (K-SAN), a generalization of RNN to additionally incorporate non-flat network topologies guided by prior knowledge. There are two characteristics: 1) important substructures can be captured from small training data, allowing the model to generalize to previously unseen test data; 2) the model automatically figures out the salient substructures that are essential to predict the semantic tags of the given sentences, so that the understanding performance can be improved. The experiments on the benchmark Air Travel Information System (ATIS) data show that the proposed K-SAN architecture can effectively extract salient knowledge from substructures with an attention mechanism, and outperform the performance of the state-of-the-art neural network based frameworks.",
