      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Over the last decade, deep learning techniques have become very popular in various application domains such as computer vision, automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and bioinformatics where they have been shown to produce state-of-the-art results on various tasks. At the same time, there has been very little progress on applications in cognitive neuroscience and specifically for analyzing signals recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) – a non-invasive brain imaging technique that relies on electrodes placed on the scalp to measure the electrical activity of the brain. EEG is especially popular for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which need to distinguish between different brain states.\nWorking with EEG data poses several challenges. Brain waves recorded in the EEG have a very low signal-to-noise ratio and there is a wide variety of noise sources. For instance, the sensitive recording equipment easily picks up interferences from the surroundings such as electrical line noise. Muscle activity and eye movements or blinks introduce further artifacts. Usually, only certain brain activity is of interest, which needs to be separated from other background processes. This is especially challenging as EEG has a good (millisecond) time resolution to record both, slowly and rapidly changing dynamics of brain activity but lacks spatial resolution on the scalp with additional spatial smearing caused by the skull. Hence, in order to identify the relevant portion of the signal, sophisticated analysis techniques are required that should also take into account temporal information.\nThis is where deep learning techniques could help. For these techniques, training usually involves the usage of large corpora such as ImageNet or TIMIT. As EEG data are high-dimensional1 and complex, this also calls for large datasets to train deep networks for EEG analysis and classification. Unfortunately, there is no such abundance of EEG data. Unlike photos or texts extracted from the in-\n1 A single trial comprising ten seconds of EEG with 64 channels sampled at 100 Hz has already 64000 dimensions and the number of channels and the sampling rate of EEG recordings can be much higher than this.\nternet, EEG data are rather costly and scarce. Experimental constraints often only allow for a limited number of trials to be recorded. Furthermore, it requires special equipment and a substantial effort to collect them and assure their quality. Consequently, EEG datasets are only rarely shared beyond the boundaries of individual labs and institutes. This makes it hard for deep learning researchers to develop more sophisticated analysis techniques tailored to this kind of data.\nWith this paper, we want to address several of these challenges. We briefly review related work in Section 2 and introduce our dataset in Section 3."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "A major purpose of the work presented in this paper is to help advance the state of the art of signal analysis techniques in the field of cognitive neuroscience. In this application domain, the potential of deep learning techniques for neuroimaging has been demonstrated very recently by Plis et al. (2013) for functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, applications of deep learning techniques within cognitive neuroscience and specifically for processing EEG recordings have been very limited so far.\nMirowski et al. (2009) applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for epileptic seizure prediction in EEG and intercranial EEG. Wulsin et al. (2011) used deep belief nets (DBNs) to detect anomalies related to epilepsy in EEG recordings by classifying individual “channel-seconds”, i.e., one-second chunks from a single EEG channel without further information from other channels or about prior values. Their classifier was first pre-trained layer by layer as an auto-encoder on unlabelled data, followed by a supervised fine-tuning with backpropagation on a much smaller labeled dataset. They found that working on raw, unprocessed data (sampled at 256Hz) led to a classification accuracy comparable to hand-crafted features.\nLängkvist et al. (2012) similarly employed DBNs combined with hidden Markov models (HMMs) to classify different sleep stages. Their data for 25 subjects comprised EEG as well as recordings of eye movements and skeletal muscle activity. Again, the data was segmented into one-second chunks. Here, a DBN on raw data showed a classification accuracy close to one using 28 selected features.\nFurthermore, there have been some applications of CNNs for BCIs. Cecotti & Gräser (2008) used a special CNN for classification of steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) – i.e., brain oscillation induced by visual stimuli. The network integrated the Fourier transform between convolutional layers, which transformed the data from the time domain to a time-frequency representation. Another CNNs for detecting P300 waves was described in Cecotti & Gräser (2011).\nThere has also been early work on emotion recognition from EEG using deep neural networks such as described by Jirayucharoensak et al. (2014) and Zheng et al. (2014). In our early work, we used stacked denoising auto-encoders (SDAs) and CNNs to classify EEG recordings of rhythm perception and identify their ethnic origin – East African or Western – (Stober et al. (2014b)) as well as distinguish individual rhythms (Stober et al. (2014a))."

      "heading" : "3 DATASET AND PRE-PROCESSING",
      "text" : "The OpenMIIR dataset (Stober et al. (2015)) is a public domain dataset of EEG recordings taken during music perception and imagination.2 We recently acquired this data during an ongoing study that so far comprised 10 subjects listening to and imagining 12 short music fragments – each 7s– 16s long – taken from well-known pieces. These stimuli were selected from different genres and systematically span several musical dimensions such as meter, tempo and the presence of lyrics as shown in Table 1. This way, various retrieval and classification scenarios can be addressed.\nAll stimuli were normalized in volume and kept as similar in length as possible with care taken to ensure that they all contained complete musical phrases starting from the beginning of the piece. The pairs of recordings for the same song with and without lyrics were tempo-matched. The stimuli were presented to the participants in several conditions while we recorded EEG. For the experiments\n2 The dataset is available at https://github.com/sstober/openmiir\ndescribed in this paper, we only focus on the perception condition, where participants were asked to just listen to the stimuli. The presentation was divided into 5 blocks that each comprised all 12 stimuli in randomized order. In total, 60 perception trials were recorded per subject.\nEEG was recorded with a BioSemi Active-Two system using 64+2 EEG channels at 512Hz. Horizontal and vertical electrooculography (EOG) channels were used to record eye movements. The following common-practice pre-processing steps were applied to the raw EEG and EOG data using the MNE-python toolbox by Gramfort et al. (2013) to remove unwanted artifacts. We removed and interpolated bad EEG channels (between 0 and 3 per subject) identified by manual visual inspection. The data was then filtered with a bandpass keeping a frequency range between 0.5 and 30Hz. This also removed any slow signal drift in the EEG. To remove artifacts caused by eye blinks, we computed independent components using extended Infomax independent component analysis (ICA) as described by Lee et al. (1999) and semi-automatically removed components that had a high correlation with the EOG channels. Afterwards, the 64 EEG channels were reconstructed from the remaining independent components without reducing dimensionality. Furthermore, the data of one participant was excluded at this stage because of a considerable number of trials with movement artifacts due to coughing. Finally, all trial channels were additionally normalized to zero mean and range [−1, 1]."

      "heading" : "4 EXPERIMENTS",
      "text" : "Using the EEG dataset described in the previous section, we would like to learn discriminative features that can be used by a classifier to distinguish between the different music stimuli. Ideally, these feature should also allow interpretation by cognitive neuroscientists to facilitate findings about the underlying cognitive processes. In our previous experiments with EEG recordings of rhythm perception, CNNs showed promising classification performance but the learned features were not easy to interpret (Stober et al. (2014a)).\nI order to establish a baseline for the OpenMIIR dataset, we first applied plain supervised CNN training. We could then compare the classification accuracy and the learned features against the results obtained through our proposed feature learning approaches. To measure classification accuracy, we used the trials of the third block of each subject as test set. This set comprised 108 trials (9 subjects x 12 stimuli x 1 trial). The remaining 432 trials (9 subjects x 12 stimuli x 4 trials) were used for training and model selection. For supervised training, we employed a 9-fold cross-validation scheme by training on the data from 8 subjects (384 trials) and validating on the remain one (48 trials). This approach allows us to additional estimate the cross-subject performance of a trained model. We compared two strategies for aggregating the separate fold models – using a majority vote or averaging the model parameters."

      "heading" : "4.1 IMPLEMENTATION AND REPRODUCIBILITY",
      "text" : "For reproducibility and to encourage further developments and research in this direction, all code necessary to build the proposed deep network structures and to run the experiments described in the following is shared as open source within the deepthought project.3 The implementation is based on the libraries Pylearn2 (Goodfellow et al. (2013)) and Theano (Bergstra et al. (2010)) and comprises various custom Layer and Dataset classes – such as for on-the-fly generation of trial tuples and the respective classification targets during iteration.\nIn the context of this paper, the following general implementation conventions apply: All convolutional layers use the sigmoid tanh nonlinearity because its output naturally matches the value range of the network inputs ([-1,1]) and thus facilitates easier interpretation of the activation values. Furthermore, bias terms are not used. Convolution is always solely applied along the time (samples) axis.4 For the classifiers, we use a DLSVM output layer employing the hinge loss as described by Tang (2013) with an implementation based on the one provided by Kastner.5 This generally resulted in a better classification performance than the commonly used Softmax in all our previous experiments. For the convolutional auto-encoders, our implementation of the de-convolutional layers has been derived from the code for generative adversarial nets by Goodfellow et al. (2014).6 Stochastic gradient descent with batches of 128 trials is used for training. During supervised training, we apply Dropout regularization Hinton et al. (2012) and a learning rate momentum. During unsupervised pre-training, we do not use Dropout as the expected benefit is much lower here and does not justify the increase in processing time. Generally, the learning rate is set to decay by a constant factor per epoch. Furthermore, we use a L1 weight regularization penalty term in the cost function to encourage feature sparsity. For hyper-parameter selection, we employ the Bayesian optimization technique described by Snoek et al. (2012) which has been implemented in the Spearmint library.7"

      "text" : "As the baseline, we considered CNNs with two convolutional layers using raw EEG as input, which was either down-sampled to 64 Hz or kept at the original sampling rate of 512 Hz. The higher rate offers better timing precision at the expense of increasing the processing time and the memory requirement. We wanted to know whether using 512 Hz would be justified by a significant increase in classification accuracy. All trials were cut off at 6.9s, the length of the shortest stimulus, which resulted in an input length of 440 or 4866 samples respectively. We conducted a search on the hyper-parameter grid optimizing solely structural network parameters and the learning rate. Results for selected networks are shown in Table 2.\n3 https://github.com/sstober/deepthought (code will be updated paper publication) 4 Beyond the scope of this paper, convolution could be applied in the spatial or frequency domain. 5 https://github.com/kastnerkyle/pylearn2/blob/svm_layer/ 6https://github.com/goodfeli/adversarial 7 https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint"

    "abstractText" : "We introduce and compare several strategies for learning discriminative features from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings using deep learning techniques. EEG data are generally only available in small quantities, they are highdimensional with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and there is considerable variability between individual subjects and recording sessions. Our proposed techniques specifically address these challenges for feature learning. Similarity-constraint encoders learn features that allow to distinguish between classes by demanding that two trials from the same class are more similar to each other than to trials from other classes. This tuple-based training approach is especially suitable for small datasets. Hydra-nets allow for separate processing pathways adapting to subsets of a dataset and thus combine the advantages of individual feature learning (better adaptation of early, low-level processing) with group model training (better generalization of higher-level processing in deeper layers). This way, models can, for instance, adapt to each subject individually to compensate for differences in spatial patterns due to anatomical differences or variance in electrode positions. The different techniques are evaluated using the publicly available OpenMIIR dataset of EEG recordings taken while participants listened to and imagined music.",
