We use anomaly detection, which identifies patterns not conforming to a historic norm. In both types of systems, the rates of change vary dramatically over time (due to burstiness) and over components (due to service difference). To efficiently model such systems, we use continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) and avoid specifying a fixed update interval common to discrete-time models. We build generative models from the normal training data, and abnormal behaviors are flagged based on their likelihood under this norm. For NIDS, we construct a hierarchical CTBN model for the network packet traces and use Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering to learn the parameters. We illustrate the power of our method through experiments on detecting real worms and identifying hosts on two publicly available network traces, the MAWI dataset and the LBNL dataset. For HIDS, we develop a novel learning method to deal with the finite resolution of system log file time stamps, without losing the benefits of our continuous time model. We demonstrate the method by detecting intrusions in the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset."

      "text" : "Misuse or abuse of computer systems is a critical issue for system administrators. Our goal is to detect these attacks that attempt to compromise the performance quality of a particular host machine.\nIt is time-consuming and error-prone to acquire labeled data that contains both good and bad behaviors from which to build a classifier. Additionally, the frequency with which attacks are developed can make maintaining a database of all previously seen attacks inefficient or even infeasible. Anomaly detection can identify new attacks even if the attack type was unknown beforehand. Unsupervised learning allows the anomaly detector to adapt to changing environments, thereby extending its domain of usefulness. By modeling normal behavior from historic clean data, we can identify abnormal activity without a direct prior model of the attack by simply comparing its deviation from the learned norm.\nIn a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS), the network packet traces are monitored. Network traffic traces collect information from a network’s data stream and provide an external view of the network behavior. In a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS), the internal state of a computing system is analyzed. System call logs are a convenient way of monitoring executing programs’ behavior through their operating system calls.\nBoth systems are composed of activities that happen at dramatically different time granularity. Users alternate between busily using their computer and resting. During the busy period, a burst of action may cause a peak of network traffic flow or operating system usage. However, during the\nc©2010 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nresting period, the computer just maintains its regular running pattern, and network or system activities are much less intense, e.g. automatically checking email every few minutes. Even within each of these global modes there are variations. Therefore, a dynamic model that requires discretizing the time is not efficient. We develop intrusion detection techniques using continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller, 2002) for both data types. Although the two data are of completely different formats and semantic meaning, we demonstrate the flexibility of a continuous time generative model (such as a CTBN) to describe either.\nOur first effort is to detect anomalies from network traffic traces (NIDS). Abnormal traffic must differ in some way from the normal traffic patterns. While this difference may be very subtle and difficult to detect, the more subtle the attack, the longer the attack will take and the more it will stress the patience of the attacker. Looking at summarized information like flow statistics is not helpful, especially for stealthy worms which can mingle well with normal traffic by sacrificing their spreading speed and scale. We, therefore, feel that looking for abnormalities in the detailed network traffic flow level is a utile method for finding attacks. A network flow for a given host machine is a sequence of continuous-time asynchronous events. Furthermore, these events form a complex structured system, where statistical dependencies relate network activities like packet emissions and connections. We employ CTBNs to reason about these structured stochastic network processes.\nOur CTBN model contains a number of observed network events (packet emissions and concurrent port connections changes). To allow our model to be more descriptive, we also add latent variables that tie the activity variables together. Exact inference in this method is no longer feasible. Therefore, we use Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering (RBPF) to estimate the parameters.\nOur second effort is to detect intrusions using system call logs (HIDS). A system log file contains an ordered list of calls made to a computer’s operating system by an executing program. We focus on analyzing the ordering and the context of the sequence, rather than simply counting the overall statistics. A CTBN is a natural way of modeling such sequential data. Because of the finite resolution of computer clock, all the system calls issued within a clock tick are assigned a same time stamp. Therefore the data stream consists of long periods of time with no activity, followed by sequences of calls in which the order is correctly recorded, but the exact timing information is lost. This poses a new challenge for CTBN reasoning. We present here a learning method for such type of data without resorting to time discretization.\nWe validate our NIDS technique on the MAWI dataset and the LBNL dataset, and our HIDS technique on the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset. Both applications give good results when compared with other method.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the related work in intrusion detection. In Section 3 we review continuoustimeMarkov processes and continuous time Bayesian networks. In Section 4 we describe the CTBN model and the RBPF inference algorithms for the NIDS problem. In Section 5 we describe the CTBN model and the parameter estimation algorithm for HIDS, including how to deal with imprecise timing measurements. In Section 6 we show our experimental results for both of the applications."

The work of Eskin, Arnold, Prerau, Portnoy, and Stolfo (2002) is similar to our approach in that they apply their method to both of these kinds of\ndata. They map data elements to a feature space and detect anomalies by determining which points lie in sparse regions using cluster-based estimation, K-nearest neighbors and one-class SVM.

      "text" : "For network traffic data, we build upon our previous work (Xu & Shelton, 2008). There we made the assumption that network activities are independent across different ports. This allowed us to factorize the model into port-level submodels and standard exact inference techniques could be used for parameter learning. In this paper, we remove this restriction. There is no application-specific reason that traffic should be independent by ports. By tying the traffic together, our model describes more complicated structural dependencies among variables. We derive a Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering algorithm to estimate the parameters for our model. Our work also differs in that we are not only interested in the intrusion detection problem, but host identity recognition as well.\nAs a signature-based detection algorithm, we share many of the assumptions of Karagiannis, Papagiannaki, and Faloutsos (2005). In particular, we also assume that we do not have access to the internals of the machines on the networks, which rules out methods like those of Malan and Smith (2005), Cha (2005), Qin and Lee (2004), and Eskin et al. (2002). However, we differ in that our approach does not rely on preset values, require human intervention and interpretation, nor assume that we have access to network-wide traffic information. Network-wide data and human intervention have advantages, but they can also lead to difficulties (data collation in the face of an attack and increased human effort), so we chose to leave them out of our solution.\nMany learning, or adaptive, methods have been proposed for network data. Some of these — for example, those of Zuev and Moore (2005) and Soule, Salamatian, Taft, Emilion, and Papagiannali (2004) — approach the problem as a classification task which requires labeled data. Dewaele, Fukuda, and Borgnat (2007) profile the statistical characteristics of anomalies by using random projection techniques (sketches) to reduce the data dimensionality and a multi-resolution non-Gaussian marginal distribution to extract anomalies at different aggregation levels. The goal of such papers is usually not to detect attacks but rather to classify non-attacks by traffic type; if applied to attack detection, they would risk missing new types of attacks. Furthermore, they frequently treat each network activity separately, instead of considering their temporal context.\nLakhina, Crovella, and Diot (2005) has a nice summary of adaptive (or statistical) methods that look at anomaly detection (instead of classification). They use an entropy-based method for the entire network traffic. Many of the other methods, such as that of Ye, Emran, Chen, and Vilbert (2002), use either statistical tests or subspace methods that assume the features of the connections or packets are distributed normally. Rieck and Laskov (2007) model the language features like n-grams and words from connection payloads. Xu, Zhang, and Bhattacharyya (2005) also use unsupervised methods, but they concentrate on clustering traffic across a whole network. Similarly, Soule, Salamatian, and Taft (2005) build an anomaly detector based on Markov models, but it is for the network traffic patterns as a whole and does not function at the host level.\nThe work of Soule et al. (2004) is very similar in statistical flavor to our work. They also fit a distribution (in their case, a histogram modeled as a Dirichlet distribution) to network data. However, they model flow-level statistics, whereas we work at the level of individual connections. Additionally, they are attempting network-wide clustering of flows instead of anomaly detection.\nThe work of Moore and Zuev (2005), like our approach, models traffic with graphical models, in particular, Naive Bayes networks. But their goal is to categorize network traffic instead of detecting attacks. Kruegel, Mutz, Robertson, and Valeur (2003) present a Bayesian approach to the detecting problem as an event classification task while we only care about whether the host is under attack during an interval.\nThe work of Lazarevic, Ertoz, Kumar, Ozgur, and Srivastava (2003) is also similar to our work. It is one of the few papers to attempt to find attacks at the host level. They employ nearest neighbor, a Mahalanobis distance approach, and a density-based local outliers method, each using 23 features of the connections. Although their methods make the standard i.i.d. assumption about the data (and therefore miss the temporal context of the connection) and use 23 features (compared to our few features), we compare our results to theirs in Section 6, as the closest prior work. Agosta, Duik-Wasser, Chandrashekar, and Livadas (2007) present an adaptive detector whose threshold is time-varying. It is similar to our work in that they also rely on model-based algorithms. But they employ the host internal states like CPU loads which are not available to us.\nWhile there has been a great variety of previous work, our work is novel in that it detects anomalies at the host level using only the timing features of network activities. We do not consider each connection (or packet) in isolation, but rather in a complex context. We capture the statistical dynamic dependencies between packets and connections to find sequences of network traffic that are anomalous as a group."

      "text" : "Previous work on detecting intrusions in system call logs can be roughly grouped into two categories: sequence-based and feature-based. Sequence-based methods focus on the sequential order of the events while feature-based methods treat system calls as independent data elements. Our method belongs to the former category since we use a CTBN to model the dynamics of the sequences.\nTime-delay embedding (tide) and sequence time-delay embedding (stide) are two examples of sequence based methods (Forrest, A.Hofmeyr, Somayaji, & A.Longstaff, 1996; A.Hofmeyr, Forrest, & Somayaji, 1998). They generalize the data by building a database storing previously seen system call sub-sequences, and test by looking up subsequences in the database. These methods are straightforward and often achieve good results. We compare with them in our experiments. Tandon and Chan (2005) look at a richer set of attributes like return value and arguments associated with a system call while we only make use of the system call names.\nFeature based methods like those of Hu, Liao, and Vemuri (2003) use the same dataset we use, the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset, but their training data is noisy and they try to find a classification hyperplane using robust support vector machines (RSVMs) to separate normal system call profiles from intrusive ones. Eskin (2000) also works on noisy data. They make the assumption that their training data contains a large portion of normal elements and few anomalies. They present a mixture of distribution over normal and abnormal data and calculate the likelihood change if a data point is moved from normal part to abnormal part to get the optimum data partition.\nYeung and Ding (2002) try to use both techniques. They provide both dynamic and static behavioral models for system call data. For the dynamic method, a hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to model the normal system events and a likelihood is calculated for each testing sequence and compared against a certain threshold. Our work for the system call traces problem is very close\nto their framework since we also build a dynamic model for the sequential data and compute the likelihood of a testing example as a score. But we are different in that our CTBN models the continuous time dynamics rather than time-sliced behaviors. For the static method, they represent the normal behavior by a command occurrence frequency distribution and measure the distance from the testing example to this norm by cross entropy. The dataset they use is KDD archive dataset."

Their model is non-Markovian, but also deals with network events as the basic observational unit.\nTo estimate the parameters of the large network we build for the network traffic data, we use Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPFs). Doucet, de Freitas, Murphy, and Russel (2000) propose a RBPF algorithm for dynamic Bayesian networks that works in discrete time fashion by exploiting the structure of the DBN. Ng, Pfeffer, and Dearden (2005) extend the RBPF to continuous time dynamic systems and apply the method to the K-9 experimental Mars rover at NASA Ames Research Center. Their model is a hybrid system containing both discrete and continuous variables. They use particle filters for the discrete variables and unscented filters for the continuous variables. Our work are similar to theirs in that we apply a RBPF to a CTBN. But our model only contains discrete variables and our evidence is over continuous time (as opposed to only “snapshots” of the system state)."

      "text" : "We first give an definition of an inhomogeneous Markov process called a conditional Markov process. It is a critical concept for us to formally introduce the CTBN framework.\nDefinition 1 (Nodelman, Shelton, & Koller, 2003) A conditional Markov process X is an inhomogeneous Markov process whose intensity matrix varies as a function of the current values of a set of discrete conditioning variables U . It is parametrized using a conditional intensity matrix (CIM) QX|U – a set of homogeneous intensity matrices QX|u, one for each instantiation of values u to U .\nWe call U the parents ofX . When the set of U is empty, the CIM is simply a standard intensity matrix.\nCIMs provide a way to model the temporal behavior of one variable conditioned on some other variables. By putting these local models together, we have a joint structured model — a continuous time Bayesian network.\nDefinition 2 (Nodelman et al., 2003) A continuous time Bayesian networkN over a set of stochastic processes X consists of two components: an initial distribution P 0X , specified as a Bayesian network B over a set of random variables X, and a continuous transition model, specified using a directed (possibly cyclic) graph G whose nodes areX ∈ X; UX denotes the parents ofX in G. Each variable X ∈ X is associated with a conditional intensity matrix, QX|UX .\nThe dynamics of a CTBN are quantitatively defined by a graph. The instantaneous evolution of a variable depends only on the current value of its parents in the graph. The quantitative description of a variable’s dynamics is given by a set of intensity matrices, one for each value of its parents. That means the transition behavior of the variable is controlled by the current values of its parents.\nThe standard notion of d-separation from Bayesian networks carries over to CTBNs. Because graphs are cyclic and variables represent processes (not single random variables), the implications are a little different. A variable (process) is still independent of its non-descendants given its parents, and it is still independent of everything given its Markov blanket (any variable that is either a parent, a child, or a parent of a child). Cycles can cause parents to also be children, but provided they are considered as both, the above definitions still hold. More importantly, the notion of “given” works only if the full trajectory for the variable in question is known. Therefore, X and its grandchildren are not independent givenX’s children’s values at a single instant. Rather, they are only independent given X’s children’s full trajectories from time 0 until the last time of interest.\nIf we amalgamate all the variables in the CTBN together, we get a single homogeneous Markov process over the joint state space. In the joint state intensity matrix, a rate of 0 is assigned to any transition that involves changing more than one variable’s value at the exact same time. All other intensities can be found by looking up the value in the corresponding conditional intensity matrix for the variable that changes. The diagonal elements are the negative row sums.\nForward sampling can be done quickly in a CTBN without generating the full joint intensity matrix. We keep track of the “next event time” for each variable (sampled from the relevant exponential distribution given the current values of itself and its parent). We then select the earliest event time and change that variable (sampling from the multinomial distribution implied by the row of that variable’s relevant intensity matrix). The next event time for the variable that just changed and all of its children must be resampled, but no other variable’s time must be resampled due to the memoriless property of the exponential distribution. In this way a sequence of events (a trajectory) can be sampled."

The sequence and timing of events (e.g. packet transimission and connection establishment) are very important in network traffic flow. It matters not just how many connections were initiated in the past minute, but also their timing: if they were evenly spaced the trace is probably normal, but if they all came in a quick burst it is more suspicious. Similarly, the sequence is important. If the connections were made to sequentially increasing ports it is more likely to be a scanning virus, whereas the same set of ports in random order is more likely to be normal traffic. These are merely simple examples. We would like to detect more complex patterns.\nA typical machine in the network may have diverse activities with various service types (e.g. HTTP, SMTP). The destination port number roughly describes the type of service to which a particular network activity belongs. Some worms propagate malicious traffic toward certain well known ports to affect the quality of the associated services. By looking at traffic associated with different ports we are more sensitive to subtle variations that do not appear if we aggregate trace information across ports. Figure 1 shows the most popular ports ranked by their frequencies in the network traffic on the datasets we use (described in more depth later). These services are, to some extent, independent of each other. We therefore model each port’s traffic with its own CTBN submodel. We denote τ as the whole observed traffic sequences on the particular host, and τj as the traffic associated with port j."

      "text" : "We use the same port-level submodel as our previous work (Xu & Shelton, 2008). We have a latent variable H and four fully observed toggle variables: Pin, Pout, Cinc, Cdec.\nThe nodes packet-in, Pin, and packet-out, Pout, represent the transmission of a packet to or from the host. They have no intrinsic state: the transmission of a packet is an essentially instantaneous event. Therefore they have events (or “transitions”) without having state. This is modeled using a toggle variable in which an event is evidence of a change in the state of the variable and the rate of transition associated with each state is required to be the same.\nThe nodes connection-increase Cin and connection-decrease Cdec together describe the status of the number of concurrent connections C active on the host. Notice that C can only increase or decrease by one at any given event (the beginning or ending time of a connection). We assume that the arrival of a new connection and the termination of an existing connection are both independent of the number of other connections. Thus the intensity with which some connection starts (or stops) is same as any other connections. Therefore, these are also modeled as toggle variables.\nNodeH has 8 states that represent different abstract attributes about the machine’s internal state. The toggle variables (Pin, Pout, Cinc and Cdec) are each allowed to change only for 2 of the states of H and they are required to have the same rate for both of these states. 2 hidden states per toggle variable was chosen as a balance between expressive power and model efficiency.\nIn previous work, we assumed that the traffic associated with different ports are independent of each other, so the port-level submodels are isolated. Here we remove this restriction by introducing another latent variable G that ties the port submodels together. The full model is shown in Figure 2."

      "heading" : "4.2 Parameter Learning Using RBPF",
      "text" : "To calculate the expected sufficient statistics in the E-step of EM for parameter learning, the exact inference algorithm of Nodelman et al. (2002) flattens all the variables into a joint intensity matrix and reasons about the resulting homogeneous Markov process. The time complexity is exponential in the number of variables. For example, if there are 9 port models, the network contains 46 variables in total. Approximate inference techniques like the clique tree algorithm (Nodelman et al., 2002), message passing algorithms (Nodelman et al., 2005; Saria et al., 2007), importance sampling (Fan\n& Shelton, 2008) and Gibbs sampling (El-Hay et al., 2008) overcome this problem by sacrificing accuracy.\nWe notice that our model has a nice tree structure which makes Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering (RBPF) a perfect fit. RBPF uses a particle filter to sample a portion of the variables and analytically integrates out the rest. It decomposes the model structure efficiently and thus reduces the sampling space.\nIf we denote the N port-level hidden variables as H1, ...,HN , the posterior distribution of the whole model can be factorized as P (G,H1, ...,HN | τ) = P (G | τ) ∏N i=1 P (Hi | G, τ). Note that G and Hi are processes, so this probability is a density over complete trajectories. We use a particle filter to estimate G’s conditional distribution P (G | τ) as a set of sampled trajectories of G. It is difficult to sample directly from the posterior distribution, so we use an importance sampler to sample a particle from a proposal distribution and the particles are weighted by the ratio of its likelihood under the posterior distribution to the likelihood under the proposal distribution (Doucet et al., 2000). Since the variable G is latent and has no parents, we can use forward sampling to sample the particles from P (G) and the weight of each particle is simply the likelihood of τ conditioned on this trajectory for G (Fan & Shelton, 2008). Each port-level submodel is then dseparated from the rest of the network, given full trajectory of G (see Section 3.9 for d-separation in CTBNs). Since each is small (only 8 hidden states), they can be marginalized out exactly. That is, we can calculate P (τi | G) (where τi is the portion of the trajectory for submodel i) exactly, marginalizing out Hi with the α-β recursions from Section 3.7.\nThe expected sufficient statistics (ESS) for any variable X in a CTBN are T̄X|U[x|u], the expected amount of time X stays at state x given its parent instantiation u, and M̄X|U[x, x′|u], the expected number of transitions from state x to x′ given X’s parent instantiation u. Let gi ∼ P (G), i = 1, . . . ,M be the particles. We define their likelihood weights to be wi = P (gi|τ) P (gi)\nand let W = ∑ iwi be the sum of the weights. Then general importance sampling allows that an expected sufficient statistic can be estimated in the following way, where SS is any sufficient statistic:\nE(g,h1,...,hN )∼P (G,H1,...,HN |τ)[SS(g, h1, . . . , hN )]\n= Eg∼P (G|τ)Eh1,...,hN∼P (H1,...,HN |g,τ)[SS(g, h1, . . . , hN )] ≈ 1 W ∑ i wiEh1,...,hN∼P (H1,...,HN |gi,τ)[SS(g i, h1, . . . , hN )] .\nThe expected sufficient statistics of the whole model are in two categories: those that depend only on g, ESS(g), and those that depend on a port model k, ESS(g, hk, τk). ESS(g) is simply the summation of counts (the amount of time G stays at some state, or the number of times G transitions from one state to another) from the particles, weighted by the particle weights:\nEg∼P (G|τ)[SS(g)] ≈ 1 W ∑ i wiSS(gi) . (6)\nESS(g, hk, τk) can be calculated for each submodel independently:\nEg,h1,...,hN∼P (G,H1,...,HN |τ)[SS(g, hk, τk)]\n≈ 1 W ∑ i wi ∫ hk P (hk|gi, τk)SS(gi, hk, τk) dhk\n= 1 W ∑ i ∏ j P (τj |gi) P (τ) ∫ hk P (hk|gi, τk)SS(gi, hk, τk) dhk ∝ 1 W ∑ i ∏ j 6=k P (τj |gi) ∫ hk P (hk, τk|gi)SS(gi, hk, τk) dhk . (7)\nThe integrals are over all possible trajectories for the hidden process Hk. The first line holds by d-separation (we need only average over the submodel k, given an assignment to G). The second line expands the weight. The last line combines the weight term for submodel k with the terms in the integral to get the likelihood of hk and the submodel data. The constant of proportionality will cancel in the subsequent maximization, or it can be reconstructed by noting that ∑ x T̄X|U[x|u] should be the total time of the interval. This last integral, ∫ hk P (hk, τk|gi)SS(gi, hk, τk) dhk, and P (τj |gi) can be calculated using the technique described by Nodelman et al. (2005), for exact ESS calculation. The calculations are very similar the integrals of Section 3.7, except they intensity matrices can change from interval to interval (they are a function of the sampled trajectory gi).\nThe full E-step algorithm is shown in Figure 3 (sk represents all of the variables in submodel k). Function Submodel Estep calculates the expected sufficient statistics and the likelihood for a subnet model (Equation 7). Function CountGSS counts the empirical time and transition statistics from the sampled trajectory of G (Equation 6).\nIn EM, we use the ESS as if they were the true sufficient statistics to maximize the likelihood with respect to the parameters. For a “regular” CTBN variable X (such as our hidden variable G and H), Equation 5 performs the maximization. For our toggle variables, e.g. Pi, the likelihood\ncomponent for the toggle variable is∏ u Q MPi Pi|u exp(−QPi|uT [U = u])\nwhich can be found by setting qx|u to be the same value (QPi|u) for all x (tieing the parameters) and simplifying the product over x in Equation 2. Thus the maximum likelihood parameter estimate is\nQPi|u = MPi\nT [U = u]\nwhere MPi is the number of events for variable Pi and QPi|u is the only parameter: the rate of switching.\nWe synchronize the particles at the end of each “window” (see Section 6.1) and resample as normal for a particle filter at those points. That is, we propagate the particles forward, but stop them all at the end of the window, resample based on the weights, and then continue with the new set of particles. In general, the particles are not aligned by time, except at these resampling points."

Therefore, if the window of interest starts at time T , we wish to calculate p(τ [T, T + Tw] | τ [0, T ]) where τ [s, t] represents the observed connections and packets from time s to time t. Again, we use a RBPF to estimate this probability. The samples at time T represent the prior distribution P (G | τ [0, T ]).

Many malicious attacks on the host can be revealed directly from the internal logs.\nWe analyze the audit log format of SUN’s Solaris Basic Security Module (BSM) praudit audit logs. Each user-level and kernel event record has at least three tokens: header, subject, and return. An event begins with a “header” in the format of: header, record length in bytes, audit record version number, event description, event description modifier, time and date. The “subject” line consists of: subject, user audit ID, effective user ID, effective group ID, real user ID, real group ID, process ID, session ID, and terminal ID consisting of a device and machine name. A “return” with a return value indicating the success of the event closes the record.\nWe construct a CTBN model similar to our port-level network model. Individual system calls S1, ..., SN , which are the event description fields in the header token, are transiently observed: they happen instantaneously with no duration. We treat them as toggle variables like packets in the network model. We also introduce a hidden variable H as a parent of the system calls variables to allow correlations among them. This hidden variable is designed to model the internal state of the machine, although such a semantic meaning is not imposed by our method.

Therefore in the audit logs, a batch of system calls may be recorded as being executed at a same time point, rather than their real time stamp, as a result of this finite time accuracy. However, the correct order of the events is kept in the logs. That is, we know exactly that system call S2 follows S1 if they are recorded in this order in the audit logs. Thus all the system call timings are only partially observed. This type of partial observation has not previously been considered in CTBN inference. A typical trajectory τ over [0, T ] of system call data is shown in Figure 5: a batch of system calls are evoked at some time after ti but before the next clock tick, followed by a quiet period of arbitrary length, and yet another bunch of events at some time after ti+1 and so on.\nLet τt1:t2 denote the evidence over interval [t1, t2), τt1:t2+ denote the evidence over [t1, t2], and τt1−:t2 denote the evidence over (t1, t2). We define the vectors\nα−ti = p(Ht−i , τ0:ti) β+ti = p(τt+i :T |Ht+i )\nwhere Ht−i is the value of H just prior to the transition at ti, and Ht+i is value just afterward. We also define the vectors\nαti = p(Hti , τ0:t+i ) βti = p(τti:T |Hti)\nwhere the evidence at the transition time ti is included. We follow the forward-backward algorithm to compute αti and βti for all ti at which there is an event. To do this, we split any interval [ti, ti+1) into a “spike” period [ti, ti + δt) (δt is one resolution clock), during which there is a batch of system calls, and a “quite” period [ti+ δt, ti+1) over which no events exist, and do the propagations separately.\nFor a “spike” period [ti, ti+ δt), if the observed event sequence is s1, s2, ..., sk, we construct an artificial Markov process X with the following intensity matrix.\nQX =  Q̂H Q1 0 . . . 0 0 Q̂H Q2 . . . 0 ... ... . . . ... ...\n0 0 . . . Q̂H Qk 0 0 . . . 0 Q̂H\n .\nwhere\nQ̂H =  −qh1 − ∑ s∈S qs|h1 qh1h2 . . . qh1hm qh2h1 −qh2 − ∑ s∈S qs|h2 . . . qh2hm ... ... . . .\n... qhmh1 qhmh2 . . . −qhm − ∑ s∈S qs|hm  and\nQi =  qsi|h1 0 . . . 0 0 qsi|h2 . . . 0 ... ... . . .\n... 0 0 0 qsi|hm  X tracks the evidence sequence s1 → s2 → ...→ sk. QX is a square block matrix of dimension m × (k + 1). Each block is an m ×m matrix. The subsystem X has k + 1 blocks of states. The first block represents the state ofH before any events. The second block representsH after exactly one event, s1, happens. The third block represents H after s1 followed by s2 happens, and so on. The last block represents H after all the events finish executing in order. The subsystem has zero transition intensities everywhere except along the sequence pass. The diagonal of Q̂H is the same matrix as that of QH except that the transition intensities of all the system call variables are subtracted. This is because the full system includes transitions that were not observed. While those transition rates were set to zero (to force the system to agree with the evidence), such conditioning does not change the diagonal elements of the rate matrix (Nodelman et al., 2002). Within each of the k + 1 states of a block, H can freely change its value. Therefore, the non-diagonal elements of Q̂H have the same intensities as QH. Upon transitioning, X can only transit from some state to another according to the event sequence. Therefore, most of the blocks are 0 matrices except those to the immediate right of the diagonal blocks. The transition behavior is described by the matrix Qi. Qi has 0 intensities on non-diagonal entries because H and S can not change simultaneously. The diagonal element Qi(h, h) is the intensities of event si happening, given the current value of the hidden state is h.\nWe take the forward pass as an example to describe the propagation; the backward pass can be performed similarly. Right before ti, α−ti hasm dimensions. We expand it tom(k + 1) dimensions to form αti which only has non-zero probabilities in the first m states. αti now describes the distribution over the subsystem X . αtie\nQXδt represents the probability distribution at time ti + δt, given that some prefix of the observed sequence occurred. We take only the lastm state probabilities to condition on the entire sequence happening, thus resulting in anm-dimensional vector, αti+δt .\nFor a “quiet” period [ti + δt, ti+1), no evidence is observed. Therefore αti+δt is propagated to αti+1 using Q̂H, the rate matrix conditioned on only H events occuring:\nαti+1 = αti+δt exp(Q̂H(ti+1 − ti − δt)) .\nWhen we are done with the full forward-backward pass over the whole trajectory, we can calculate the expected sufficient statistics M̄hihj , T̄hi and M̄s|hi .

Because they slice time, events without state changes (instantaneous events) are difficult to model. Any reasonable time resolution will result with multiple events for the same variable over one time period. There is no standard way of encoding this in a DBN. If we use a toggle variable, it only records the parity of the number of events over the time interval. Furthermore, for the NIDS, events are very bursty. During active times, multiple packets are emited per second. During inactive times, there may be no activity for hours. Finding a suitable sampling rate that maintains the efficency of the model is difficult. For the HIDS, the problem is more acute. We do not know of any way of modeling timing ambiguity in a DBN without throwing away all timing information or adding a mathematical framework that essentially turns the DBN into the CTBN described here. In general, we could not find a suitable way to apply a DBN to these problems without essentially turning the DBN into a CTBN by very finely slicing time and then applying numeric tricks to speed up inference that amount to converting the stochastic matrices into rate matrices and using numeric integration for the matrix exponential.\nWe have compared against current adaptive methods for each problem individually.

We learn a CTBN model from the training data for each of the hosts. Since the network data available are clean traffic with no known intrusions, we inject real attack traces into the testing data. In particular, we inject IP Scanner, W32.Mydoom, and Slammer. We then slide a fixed-time window over the testing traces, report a single log-likelihood value for each sliding window, and compare it with a predefined threshold. If it is below the threshold, we predict it as an abnormal time period. We define the ground truth for a window to be abnormal if any attack traffic exists in the interval, and normal otherwise. The window size we use is 50 seconds. We only consider windows that contain at least one network event.\nWe compare our method employing RBPF with our previous factored CTBN model (Xu & Shelton, 2008), connection counting, nearest neighbor, Parzen-window detector (Yeung & Chow, 2002), and one-class SVM with a spectrum string kernel (Leslie, Eskin, & Noble, 2002).\nThe connection counting method is straightforward. We score a window by the number of initiated connections in the window. As most worms aggregate many connections in a short time, this method captures this particular anomaly well.\nTo make nearest neighbor competitive, we try to extract a reasonable set of features. We follow the feature selection of the work of Lazarevic et al. (2003), who use a total of 23 features. Not all of their features are available in our data. Those available are shown in Figure 6. Notice that these features are associated with each connection record. To apply the nearest neighbor method to our window based testing framework, we first calculate the nearest distance of each connection inside the window to the training set (which is composed of normal traffic only), and assign the maximum among them as the score for the window. Similarly, for the Parzen window approach, we apply the same feature set and assign the maximum density among all the connections inside a window to be the score of that window.\nBesides the above feature-based algorithms, we would also like to see how sequence-based approaches compare against our methods. These algorithms are widely used in network anomaly detection. Like our approach, they treat the traffic traces as stream data so that sequential contexts\ncan be explored. One-class SVM with spectrum string kernel was chosen for comparison. We implemented a spectrum kernel in the LIBSVM library (Chang & Lin, 2001). We give the network activities (such as a connection starting or ending, or a packet emmision or receipt) inside each portlevel submodel a distinct symbol. The sequence of these symbols are fed to the algorithm as inputs. A decision surface is trained from normal training traffic. In testing, for each sliding window, the distance from this window string to the decision hyperplane is reported as the window score. We also tried experiments using the edit distance kernel, but their results are dominated by the spectrum kernel, so we do not report them here.\nWhen injecting the attack traffic, we randomly pick a starting point somewhere in the first half of the test trace and insert worm traffic for a duration equal to α times the length of the full testing trace. The shorter α is, the harder it is to detect the anomaly. We choose α to be 0.02% for all the experiments in this work to challenge the detection tasks. We also scaled back the rates of the worms. When running at full speed, a worm is easy to detect for any method. When it slows down (and thus blends into the background traffic better), it becomes more difficult to detect. We let β be the scaling rate (e.g. 0.1 indicates a worm running at one-tenth of its normal speed).\nFor our method, we set the state space of variable G to be 4 and variable H to be 8. We use 100 samples for particle filtering, and resample the particles after every 50 seconds. For the SVM spectrum kernel method, we choose the sub-sequence length to be 5 and the parameter ν to be 0.8.\nWe show the ROC curves of all the methods in Figure 7. The curves show the overall performance on the 10 most active hosts for each dataset. Each point on the curves corresponds to a\ndifferent threshold of the algorithm. Our CTBN method out-performs the other algorithms except in the single case of the Mydoom attack against a background of the LBNL traffic. In many cases, the advantages of the CTBN approach are pronounced.\nFor all of the MAWI data, the factored and non-factored CTBN models perform comparably. We believe this is because the data only captures connections that traverse a trans-Pacific link. Therefore, not all of the connections in or out of a machine are represented. This makes reasoning about the global pattern of interaction for a machine difficult. For the LBNL data, one attack (IP scanning) shows no advantage to a non-factored model. One attack (Mydoom) shows a distinct advantage. And one attack (Slammer) indicates some advantage, depending on the desired false positive rate. This demonstrate some advantage to jointly modeling the traffic across all ports, although it is clear this advantage is not uniform over traffic patterns and attack types.\nWe also show how the ROC curves shift as we scale back the worm running speed β in Figure 8. As firewalls are built to be more sensitive to block malicious traffic, worms have to act more stealthy to sneak through. We demonstrate the robustness of our method compared to the best competitor (connection counts) to the speed of the worm’s attack."

      "heading" : "6.1.3 HOST IDENTIFICATION",
      "text" : "Identifying individual hosts based on their network traffic patterns is another useful application of our model. For instance, a household usually installs a network router. Each family member’s computer is connected to this router. To the outside Internet, the network traffic going out of the router behaves as if it is coming from one peer, but it is actually coming from different people. Dad will possibly read sports news while kids surf on social networks. It is interesting as well as useful to tell which family member is contributing the current network traffic. Host identification can also be used to combat identity theft. When a network identity is abused by the attacker, host identification techniques can help the network administrator tell whether the current network traffic of this host is consistent with its usual pattern or not.\nThe first set of experiments we construct is a host model fitting competition. The same 10 hosts picked for the worm detection tasks from LBNL dataset compose our testing pool. We learn the coupled CTBN model for each host. We split the test traces (clean) of a particular host into segments with lengths of 15 seconds. For each of the segments, we compute the log-likelihood of the segment under the learned model from all the hosts (including its own), and label the segment with the host that achieves the highest value. We compute a confusion matrix C whose element Cij equals the fraction of test traces of host i for which model j has highest log-likelihood. We expect to see the highest hit rates fall on the diagonals because ideally a host should be best described by its own model. Table 9 shows our results on the dataset of LBNL. The vast majority of traffic windows are assigned to the correct host. With the exception of host 1, the diagonals are distinctly higher than other elements in the same row. For comparison, we performed the same experiment using SVM spectrum kernel method. Again, we selected the sub-sequence length to be 5 and the parameter ν to be 0.8. We tried multiple methods for normalization (of the distance to the hyperplane) and variations of parameters. All produced very poor results with almost all of the windows assigned to a single host. We omit the table of results.\nOur second experiment is a host traffic differentiation task. We mingle the network traffic from another host with the analyzed host. We expect the detection method to successfully tell apart the two. To verify this idea, we pick one host among the 10 we choose above from LBNL dataset and split its traffic evenly into training and testing. We again learn the model from training data. For testing data, we randomly choose a period and inject another host’s traffic as if it were a worm. Our goal is to identify the period as abnormal since the host’s traffic is no longer its own behavior. Figure 10 displays the results from two such combination tests. The parameters for injecting the traffic as a worm are α = 0.02, β = 0.001. In the left graph, the nearest neighbor and Parzen window curve overlap, and both CTBN curves overlap. In the right graph, the coupled CTBN curve substantially outperforms all the other curves."

Seven weeks of training data that contain labeled network-based attacks in the midst of normal background data are publicly available at the DARPA website.

We follow Kang, Fuller, and Honavar (2005) to cross-index the BSM logs and produce a labeled list file that labels individual processes.

      "heading" : "6.2.2 ANOMALY DETECTION",
      "text" : "Our experimental goal is to detect anomalous processes. We train our CTBN model on normal processes only and test on a mixture of both normal and attack processes. The state space of the\nhidden variable H is set to 2. The log-likelihood of a whole process under the learned model represents the score of this process. We compare to the score with a predefined threshold to classify the process as a normal one or a system abuse.\nWe implement sequence time-delaying embedding (stide) and stide with frequency threshold (t-stide) for comparison (Warrender, Forrest, & Pearlmutter, 1999). These two algorithms build a database of all previously seen normal sequences of system calls and compare the testing sequences with it. They are straightforward and perform very well empirically on most of the system call log datasets. We choose the parameter k, the sequence length to be 5, and h, the locality frame length, to be 50. The results for t-stide are not shown in the following resulting graphs since they overlapped with stide in almost all cases.\nOther approaches we compare against are nearest neighbor and one-class SVM with spectrum string kernel and edit distance kernel. We follow Hu et al. (2003) and transform a process into a feature vector, consisting of the occurrence numbers of each system call in the process. The nearest distance between a testing process and the training set of processes is assigned as the score. For one-class SVM, processes are composed of strings of system calls. Normal processes are used for learning the bounding surface and the signed distance to it is assigned as the score. We set the subsequence length to be 5 and the parameter ν to be 0.5. Again, since the edit distance kernel results are dominated by the spectrum kernel, we do not show them.\nFigure 12 displays the results from two experiment settings. In the left graph, we train the model on the normal processes from week 1 and test it on all the processes from weeks 2 to 7. In the right graph, we train on normal processes from week 3 and test it on all the processes from week 4, the richest in attack processes volume. Because attacks are relatively rare compared to normal traffic, we are most interested in the region of the ROC curves with small false positive rates. So we only show the curves in the area where the false positive rate falls in the region [0, 0.05]. Our CTBN method beats nearest neighbor and SVM with spectrum kernel in both experiments. stide performs slightly better than our method in the combined test, but achieves the same accuracy in\nthe experiment using only week 3 and testing on week 4. The advantage to the CTBN model over stide is that it can be easily combined with other prior knowledge and other data sources (such as the network data from NIDS). We demonstrate that there is no loss of performance from such flexibility."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In the realm of temporal reasoning, we have introduced two additions to the CTBN literature. First, we demonstrated a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter with continuous evidence. Second, we demonstrated that we can learn and reason about data that contains imprecise timings, while still refraining from discretizing time.\nIn the realm of intrusion detection, we have demonstrated a framework that performs well on two related tasks with very different data types. By concentrating purely on event timing, without the consideration of complex features, we were able to out-perform existing methods. The continuoustime nature of our model aided greatly in modeling the bursty event sequences that occur in systems logs and network traffic. We did not have to resort to time slicing, either producing rapid slices that are inefficient for quite periods, or lengthy slices that miss the timing of bursty events.\nA combination of the two sources of information (system calls and network events) would be straight-forward with the model we have produced. We believe it would result in more accurate detection. The collection of such data is difficult, however; we leave it as an interesting next step."

The connection counting method is straightforward. We score a window by the number of initiated connections in the window. As most worms aggregate many connections in a short time, this method captures this particular anomaly well. To make nearest neighbor competitive, we try to extract a reasonable set of features.

    "abstractText" : "Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) fall into two high-level categories: network-based systems (NIDS) that monitor network behaviors, and host-based systems (HIDS) that monitor system calls. In this work, we present a general technique for both systems. We use anomaly detection, which identifies patterns not conforming to a historic norm. In both types of systems, the rates of change vary dramatically over time (due to burstiness) and over components (due to service difference). To efficiently model such systems, we use continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) and avoid specifying a fixed update interval common to discrete-time models. We build generative models from the normal training data, and abnormal behaviors are flagged based on their likelihood under this norm. For NIDS, we construct a hierarchical CTBN model for the network packet traces and use Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering to learn the parameters. We illustrate the power of our method through experiments on detecting real worms and identifying hosts on two publicly available network traces, the MAWI dataset and the LBNL dataset. For HIDS, we develop a novel learning method to deal with the finite resolution of system log file time stamps, without losing the benefits of our continuous time model. We demonstrate the method by detecting intrusions in the DARPA 1998 BSM dataset.",
