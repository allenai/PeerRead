To allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuous-time probabilistic model for a monitored patient's temporal sequence of physiological data. Our model captures \"informatively sampled\" patient episodes: the clinicians' decisions on when to observe a hospitalized patient's vital signs and lab tests over time are represented by a marked Hawkes process, with intensity parameters that are modulated by the patient's latent clinical states, and with observable physiological data (mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task Gaussian process. In addition, our model captures \"informatively censored\" patient episodes by representing the patient's latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm. Experiments conducted on a cohort of patients admitted to a major medical center over a 3-year period show that risk prognosis based on our model significantly outperforms the currently deployed medical risk scores and other baseline machine learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 14:29:51 GMT  (283kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05267v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ahmed m alaa", "scott hu", "mihaela van der schaar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05267"}
