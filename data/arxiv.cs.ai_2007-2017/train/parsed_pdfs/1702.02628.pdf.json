      "text" : "In smart cities, real-time tra c sensors may be deployed for various applications. However, sensors are prone to failures, which result in erroneous tra c data. Erroneous data can adversely a ect the performance of applications. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly and with high accuracy. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large number of false positives and false negatives, which can result in suboptimal performance.\nAnomaly detection of faulty tra c sensors has been studied in the literature. Typical approaches include using data-driven methods that incorporate historical and real-time data to detect anomalies [10], [18], [14], [16]. However, existing approaches may result in high performance-losses in tra c applications, mainly due to false-positive (FP) and false-negative (FN) errors. In order to minimize the losses, it is desirable to reduce the FP and FN rates as much as possible. But, there exists a trade-o between them, which can be changed through a detection threshold. To address this, it is necessary to take into account the tra c application when designing anomaly detectors, and quantify the losses in the tra c application caused by the FP and FN errors. By selecting the right detection threshold, the performance losses caused by FPs and FNs can be minimized.\nIn this paper, we study the problem of nding optimal thresholds for anomaly detection of faulty tra c sensors, considering route planning as the application of interest. e objective is to select the optimal thresholds of anomaly detectors in order to optimize the performance of the route planning application in the presence of faulty sensors. We devise an e ective detector for identifying faulty tra c sensors using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize losses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterize critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the trafc application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using a real-world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner [11]. Our evaluation results show that the proposed strategy successfully minimizes the performance loss and identi es the critical sensors. ar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n02 62\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nM ar\n2 01\ne remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

In the point-to-point shortest path problem, one is given as input the graph G, a query q = (o,d), where o ∈ V is an origin and d ∈ V is a destination, and the objective is to nd a minimum-cost (i.e., shortest) path from o to d in G.

A comprehensive discussion of GPs in machine learning can be found in [13].\nGPs directly elicit a prior distribution on the function f (x), and assume it to be a GP a priori,\nf (x) ∼ GP ( µ(x),k(x ,x ′) ) .

Methods for learning the hyperparameters are based on maximization of the marginal likelihood, which can be performed using gradient-based optimization algorithms."

      "text" : "Consider a transportation network modeled as a graph G = (V ,E), where edges represent road segments and vertices represent connections between road segments (e.g., tra c junctions). We assume that a subset S ⊆ E of the road segments are monitored by sensors that measure tra c state (e.g., speed, occupancy, ow) at discrete timesteps k ∈ N. e measurements of these sensors are transmitted to a navigation service, which given a set of queries Q(k) at timestep k , computes the corresponding shortest paths. For segments without a tra c sensor, we assume the navigation service uses either previously computed values or predicted values using measurements of adjacent sensors.\nTra c sensors may be faulty due to miscalibration or hardware failure. If a sensor s ∈ S is faulty, there is a discrepancy between the actual and measured values. In other words, if as (k) is the actual value and ms (k) is the measured value of faulty sensor s , thenms (k) = as (k) + εs (k), where εs (k) is the fault value at time k . In this model, we do not consider faults that result in no data being sent, since such cases can easily be ltered out by an operator."

      "text" : "Given the sensor measurements, we need to decide whether some sensors are faulty. We assume that the number of sensors that simultaneously become faulty is low, which is true in practice. As a result, for any sensor, the majority of nearby sensors that have not been marked faulty provide reliable tra c data, and so we can use these nearby sensors to predict the value measured by the sensor in question. To detect faults, we then compare the predictions to the measurements, and if there is a signi cant di erence between the predicted values and the received measurements, an alarm indicating presence of a fault in that particular sensor is triggered.\n3.2.1 Tra ic Prediction. As our tra c predictor, we use GPs, which is a kernel-based machine learning method. Kernel-based methods have gained special a ention for tra c prediction because of their generalization capability and superior nonlinear approximation. Among di erent kernel-based methods, previous work shows that GPs outperform other methods such as ARIMA and neural networks [17]. We use GPs because in addition to the above advantages, it allows for explicit probabilistic interpretation of forecasting outputs.\nAs the kernel function, we decide for the commonly used ARD squared exponential,\nK(m(k),m(k)′) = σ 2f exp ( −12 d∑ i=1 (mi (k) −m′i (k)) 2 σ 2i ) , (4)\nwherem(k) andm(k)′ are vectors of measurements, and σf and {σi }di=1 are hyperparameters.\nWe let the target variable be the predicted tra c value ps (e.g., tra c ow or occupancy) of sensor s ∈ S at timestep k . Further, we let the predictor variables be the measured tra c values of other sensors at the same timestep. In practice, two sensors are highly correlated if they are in close proximity. erefore, it is possible to select predictor variables as the measured values of d closest sensors from the target sensor, where the choice ofd depends on the network structure. is way, the predicted tra c value is de ned as ps (k) = f (mV (s)(k)), where V (s) is the set of d closest sensors from s .\n3.2.2 Detection Algorithm. We can e ciently detect failures for each sensor s ∈ S , by comparing the measured tra c value ms (k) with the predicted tra c value ps (k). We use Cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) as the detection algorithm, which is a sequential analysis technique typically used for monitoring change detection [12].\nConsider sensor s ∈ S , with a sequence of measurements ms (1), ...,ms (k) and corresponding tra c predictions with means ps (1), ...,ps (k) and standard deviations σs (1), ...,σs (k). e standardized residual signal is de ned as\nzs (k) = ms (k) − ps (k)\nσs (k) . (5)\nMoreover, upper and lower cumulative sums are de ned as,\nUs (k) = max(0,Us (k − 1) + zs (k) − bs ), (6)\nLs (k) = min(0,Ls (k − 1) + zs (k) + bs ), (7) whereUs (k) = Ls (k) = 0 for k = 1, and bs is a small constant.\nDenoting the detection threshold at timestep k by ηs (k), a measurement sequence violates the CUSUM criterion at the sample zs (k) if it obeysUs (k) > ηs (k) or Ls (k) < −ηs (k). Formally, le ing H0 and H1 be the null and fault hypothesis, the decision rule is described by\nds (Us (k),Ls (k)) = {\nH1 ifUs (k) > ηs (k) or Ls (k) < −ηs (k) H0 otherwise .\n(8)\n3.2.3 False-Negative and False-Positive Trade-o . In anomaly detectors, there might be a false negative, which means failing to raise an alarm when a fault did happen. Further, there might be a false positive, which means raising an alarm when the sensor exhibits normal behavior. It is desirable to reduce the FP and FN probabilities as much as possible. But, there exists a trade-o between them, which can be controlled by changing the threshold. In particular, by decreasing (increasing) the threshold, one can decrease (increase) the FN probability and increase (decrease) the FP probability.\nWe represent the FN probability for each sensor s by the function FNs : R+ → [0, 1], where FNs (ηs (k)) is the probability of FN when the threshold is ηs (k), given that the sensor is faulty. Similarly, we denote the a ainable FP probability for each sensor s by FPs : R+ → [0, 1], where FPs (ηs (k)) is the FP probability when the threshold is ηs (k), given that the sensor is in normal operation. It is possible to plot the FP probability as a function of the FN probability for various threshold values [5] (e.g., see Figure 3)."

In case of a FP, according to the detector, the measured valuems is incorrect, but it is actually correct. Consequently, we choose a route that is computed using our prediction ps instead of the optimal route, which would be computed using the measurementms . To quantify the loss, we need to compare the travel times of the two routes, and we must use the measured tra c value ms for this comparison since that is the correct value in this case.\nSimilarly, for a FN,T ( Pq (ms ),ps ) is the predicted travel time of\nthe shortest route using measured valuems , and T ( Pq (ps ),ps ) is the predicted travel time of the shortest path using predicted value ps . e loss caused by a FN is\nCFNs,q (ps ,ms ) = T ( Pq (ms ),ps ) −T ( Pq (ps ),ps ) , (10)\nthat is, the di erence in predicted travel time between using either the measured or the predicted value for sensor s .

Unfortunately, sensors are prone to failures, which result in erroneous trac data. Erroneous data can adversely aect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased travel time. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly and accurately. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large number of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e., missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In this paper, we devise an eective detector for identifying faulty trac sensors using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize losses due to false-positive and falsenegative errors. We also characterize critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planning application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using a realworld dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.",
