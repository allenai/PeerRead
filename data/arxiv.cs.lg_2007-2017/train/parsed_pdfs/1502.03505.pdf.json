      "text" : "Defining a distance to compare data points is an important problem occurring in many machine learning tasks. For instance, in classification, the nearest neighbor method Cover & Hart (1967) is equipped with a distance to identify the nearest neighbors. The performance of such a classifier highly depends on the quality of the equipped distance, and hence automatically finding a relevant distance from data has been the aim of many metric learning algorithms. So far, various methods have been developed for learning Mahalanobis distances in the Euclidean setting, and such metric learning methods have been successfully applied to diverse real-world problems including music recommendation Lim et al. (2013), face recognition Lu et al. (2012), image classification Mensink et al. (2012), link prediction in networks Shaw et al. (2011) and bioinformatics Wang et al. (2012). For the survey of recent advances, issues and perspectives in metric learning, see Bellet et al. (2013).\nClassical metric learning approaches focused on an Euclidean setting which do not apply to complex or structured objects. Recently, metric learning for complex objects such as histograms Cuturi & Avis (2014); Kedem et al. (2012), binary codes Norouzi et al. (2012) and strings Bellet et al. (2011) have been actively explored, to which the Euclidean distance is not relevant. However, to the best of our knowledge, metric learning for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices has not been investigated thoroughly. Learning from SPD matrices, particularly from covariance matrices, arises in a number of important classification tasks such as brain imaging Arsigny et al.\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n03 50\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n(2006); Dryden et al. (2009), brain-computer interfaces Barachant et al. (2010, 2013), pedestrian detection Tuzel et al. (2008) and texture classification Tuzel et al. (2006); Tou et al. (2009). In these applications, covariance matrices are either extracted from a physical model of the studied phenomenon (for diffusion tensor imaging) or as an empirical estimator from observations (for signal processing and computer-vision tasks). The purpose of this paper is to investigate metric learning for SPD matrices to boost the classification performance.\nSPD matrices belong to an Euclidean1 space. For example, 2×2 SPD matrixA can be written asA = [ a b b c ] with ac− b2 > 0, a > 0 and c > 0. Then symmetric matrices can be represented as points in R3 and the constraints can be plotted as a cone, inside which SPD matrices lie strictly (see Fig. 1). A straightforward approach for learning a metric in this space would be to simply use the Euclidean distance δe:\nδe(A,B) = ‖A−B‖F , (1)\nwhere ‖·‖F denotes the Frobenius norm. The Euclidean geometry of symmetric matrices implies that distances are computed along straight lines according to δe (see Fig. 1 again).\nHowever, the Euclidean geometry for averaging SPD matrices can result in a swelling effect Arsigny et al. (2007), i.e., the determinant of the average can be bigger than the determinant of each matrix. As also remarked in Fletcher & Joshi (2004) and illustrated in Fig. 1, this geometry creates a non-complete space, meaning that interpolation of SPD matrices is possible, but extrapolation can produce indefinite matrices. Hence, the swelling effect and the non-completeness of the space can result in uninterpretable solutions.\n1Note that, in order to be an Euclidean space, the space should be equipped with the Frobenius inner product 〈A,B〉F = Tr(A>B) and the derived norm ||A||F = √ 〈A,A〉F .\nTo avoid this problem, we use a more natural metric to compare SPD matrices, namely, the LogEuclidean distance δl:\nδl(A,B) = ‖log (A)− log (B)‖F , (2)\nwhere log(·) stands for the matrix logarithm. The LogEuclidean metric (and the derived distance and kernel) has been used in the literature Arsigny et al. (2006); Barachant et al. (2013), but its parameterization remained underestimated until recently Yger (2013). In this paper, we propose a supervised approach to learning the LogEuclidean metric. More specifically, we formulate our LogEuclidean metric learning problem as the kernel-target alignment problem Cristianini et al. (2001); Cortes et al. (2012), and solve the non-trivial optimization problem using the Riemannian geometry for SPD matrices. Through experiments on signal processing and computer vision applications, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed metric learning method."

A matrix A is said to be positive-definite (A 0) if x>Ax > 0 for all non-zero x ∈ Rd, and the set of d× d SPD matrices is denoted by Pd.\nTo learn a metric, we need to parameterize a distance. In this paper, following Bhatia (2009), we focus on the congruent transform, i.e., for any A,G ∈ Pd,{\nPd 7→ Pd Γ G− 1 2 : A→ G− 12AG− 12 .\nThus, the LogEuclidean distance (2) is parameterized using G ∈ Pd as\nδGl (A,B) = δl ( Γ G− 1 2 (A),Γ G− 1 2 (B) )\n(3) = ‖log ( G− 1 2AG− 1 2 ) − log ( G− 1 2BG− 1 2 ) ‖F .\nOur goal is to learn the parameter matrix G from a set of n training samples,\n{(Xi, yi)|Xi ∈ Pd, yi ∈ {+1,−1}}ni=1,\nso that the performance of the nearest neighbor classifier on Pd is maximally enhanced. G was implicitly chosen as the identity matrix in Arsigny et al. (2006), while G was heuristically chosen as the Riemannian mean of training samples in Barachant et al. (2013) and Yger (2013).

Our aim is to find the optimal G in terms of classification performance."

To cope with this problem, we introduce a more sophisticated approach based on the Riemannian geometry below."

      "heading" : "2.3 Riemanian Gradient Optimization",
      "text" : "Considering Pd as a Riemannian manifold provides us useful tools for solving our optimization problem. A basic optimization algorithm on the Riemannian manifold is the geodesic gradient descent2, which optimizes the objective function along the geodesic computed from the Riemannian gradient gradGf(G). For optimization problem (4), the geodesic from Gt to Gt+1 is given by\nGt+1 =G 1 2 t exp ( ηG − 12 t gradGtf(Gt)G − 12 t ) G 1 2 t , (6)\nwhere η ≥ 0 is the step size and exp(.) denotes the matrix exponential. Below, we explain how the above formula was derived.\n2 For more sophisticated optimization methods, see Absil et al. (2009) and Boumal et al. (2014).\nAs stated in Bhatia (2009), Pd is an open subset of the ambient Euclidean space of d × d symmetric matrices Sd. As such, it is an instance of an embedded sub-manifold of Sd and so it is a differentiable manifold of dimension d (d+ 1) /2. From this structure of differential manifolds, we can derive the notion of tangent space TGPd at each point G ∈ Pd. In general, tangent spaces are identified with subspaces of the ambient space. In the current setup, as Pd is an open sub-manifold, we identify the tangent space at G as TGPd = Sd, the space of symmetric matrices of size d× d.\nThen, in order to turn this differential manifold into a Riemannian manifold, we need to equip its tangent spaces with a metric. One choice of metric (leading to a complete Riemannian manifold) is the affine-invariant metric, which, for SA, SB ∈ TGPd, is defined as:\n〈SA, SB〉G = Tr ( G−1SAG −1SB ) . (7)\nNote that a Riemannian gradient (that is used by first-order Riemannian optimization methods) is defined with respect to a given tangent space. Then, in order to be coherent with the metric of the tangent space (defined in Eq. (7)), gradGf(G), the Riemannian gradient at G can be obtained from the Euclidean gradient∇f as\ngradGf(G) = Gsym(∇f(G))G.\nAs detailed in Appendix A.1, the Euclidean gradient∇f (G) can be obtained as\n∇f (G) = ∑ ij Zij(G)∇hij (G) ,\nwhere\nZ(G) = U\n( yy T\n‖Uh(G)U‖F − f (G)Uh (G)U ‖Uh(G)U‖2F\n) U,\n∇hij (G) = X − 12 i (DQi(G) [sym (Aij)])X − 12 i\n+X − 12 j (DQj(G) [sym (Aji)])X − 12 j , Qi(G) = log ( X − 12 i GX − 12 i ) ,\nAij = X 1 2 i X − 12 j Qj(G)X 1 2 j X − 12 i ,\nsym (A) = A+AT\n2 ,\nwhere Df (G) [ Ġ ]\nis the directional derivative of f (G) in the direction Ġ. To our knowledge, there is no closedform formula for computing the directional derivatives DQi(G) [sym (Aij)] and DQj(G) [sym (Aji)]. However, we can numerically evaluate them, as shown in Boumal & Absil (2011) and Al-Mohy & Higham (2009).\nThen any displacement in a tangent space TGPd can be mapped back on the manifold (and vice versa) using the reciprocal logarithmic and exponential mappings (see Fig. 2). Any symmetric matrix SA belonging to TGPd, the tangent space at G, can be mapped on Pd (with the reciprocal operation) as\nA = expG (SA) = G 1 2 exp\n( G− 1 2SAG − 12 ) G 1 2 , (8)\nSA = logG (A) = G 1 2 log\n( G− 1 2AG− 1 2 ) G 1 2 . (9)\nThese formula give the basic ingredients for implementing a geodesic gradient ascent method (as illustrated in Fig. 3) for our objective function3. Indeed, from Eq. (8), the geodesic is given by\nGt+1 = expGt ( ηgradGtf(Gt) ) ,\nwhich leads to Eq. (6)."

      "text" : "Depending on the type of geometry chosen, there exist several choices of distances and divergences for comparing SPD matrices. As already discussed in literature Arsigny et al. (2006); Pennec et al. (2006); Dryden et al. (2009); Fletcher & Joshi (2004); Cherian et al. (2011), different tools come along with various implicit invariance properties and computational complexities.\n3More details about optimization on Riemannian matrix manifolds and the geometry of Pd can be found in Absil et al. (2009) and in Bhatia (2009).\nAs explained in Bhatia (2009), when using the geometry implied by the metric in Eq. 7, the distance between two SPD matrices A and B is computed along a curve (called the geodesic) and the associated affine-invariant Riemannian metric (AIRM) distance is defined as\nδr(A,B) = ‖log(A− 1 2BA− 1 2 )‖F (10)\n=\n( d∑\ni=1\nlog2 λi (A,B)\n) 1 2\nwhere λi (A,B) are the eigenvalues of the pencil (A,B). As illustrated in Fig. 1, when using the Riemannian geometry, the space Pd becomes a complete manifold. As already stated in Arsigny et al. (2007), this distance is immune to the swelling effect. Thus, it could be a good candidate for distance metric learning for covariance matrices.\nHowever, the AIRM distance comes along with an invariance to a class of congruent transforms Bhatia (2009) and it leads to the following isometry for any M ∈ Pd:\nδr(ΓM (A),ΓM (B)) = δr(A,B). (11)\nHence, unlike the LogEuclidean distance, the AIRM distance is immune to the transform Γ(.) and it can not be learned using our approach.\nApart from their difference in terms of invariance properties, it should be highlighted that the AIRM distance is not negative-definite and then, contrary to the LogEuclidean distance, cannot be used for defining positive-definite kernels on SPD matrices Haasdonk & Bahlmann (2004); Sra (2011); Barachant et al. (2013).\nUsing information geometry and extending divergences to the matrix case Cherian et al. (2011); Sra (2011, 2012), a symmetrized LogDeterminant divergence (also called the symmetrized Stein loss) can also be used. This divergence can be seen as an approximation of the AIRM distance and as such, there exist some bounds between the AIRM distance and this symmetrized divergence Sra (2011). Moreover, this divergence is invariant to the same transformation as the AIRM distance, but can lead under some conditions to a definite-positive kernel.\nG\nIn this work, we look for a distance on SPD matrices tailored for classification. Due to the non-completeness of the space and the swelling effect, the Euclidean distance is not a valid candidate. Hence, the distances derived from Riemannian geometries (and their approximations) are more promising candidates, but in some cases, they are difficult to parametrize. Using the congruent transform Γ\nG− 1 2 (.), it is possible to parametrize the LogEuclidean distance but not the AIRM distance nor the symmetrized Stein loss due to their invariance properties."

      "heading" : "3.2 Interpretations of LogEuclidean metric learning",
      "text" : "Compared to the Euclidean and AIRM distances, the LogEuclidean distance has several advantages: it is a Riemannian distance (immune to the swelling effect) and is easy to compute. In fact, using the fact that the mapping in Eq. (9) transforms matrices from the curved space Pd to the flat space Sd, the LogEuclidean distance can be interpreted as the Euclidean distance between the matrices mapped into Sd.\nInterestingly, this LogEuclidean metric can be interpreted as the scalar product, 〈Si, Sj〉G = Tr ( G− 1 2SiG −1SjG − 12 ) ,\nin the tangent plane ofPd at the pointG, with Si and Sj the mapping aroundG ofXi andXj through the logarithmic map. Hence, according to the taxonomy developed in Bellet et al. (2013), since we optimizeG through a logarithmic mapping on a Riemannian manifold, our approach is an instance of non-linear similarity learning.\nIn this view, the parameter G can be seen as the center of the tangent plane, and it has been empirically observed Yger (2013) that the choice of G has a strong impact on the metric behaviour. So far, G has been heuristically tuned using either the identity matrix or the Riemannian mean Moakher (2005); Jeuris et al. (2012) of data. However, as highlighted later, mapping a manifold onto a tangent space implies a deformation of the data. This deformation can either be harmful or beneficial to classification. By optimizing the choice of G with respect to a discrimination criterion, we try to force the deformation to improve classification performance. As shown in Eq. (7), every tangent space is equipped with a different metric4. Hence, choosing a new reference for a tangent space leads to choosing a new scalar product. In that sense, learning the reference point of a tangent space is equivalent to learning a metric.\nThe LogEuclidean metric is simply a scalar product (i.e., a linear kernel) applied to data mapped through a matrix logarithm. For this reason, it has sometimes been referred to as the LogEuclidean kernel Barachant et al.\n4The scalar product defined at every tangent space TGPd is close to a Mahalanobis scalar product parametrized by G−1.\n(2013); Yger (2013); Jayasumana et al. (2013). In this regard, the optimization of the LogEuclidean metric can also be interpreted as a kernel learning approach.\nThe use of the LogEuclidean distance can be interpreted as flattening the Riemannian manifold. As discussed below, such a mapping implies some deformations of the space of SPD matrices (see Fig. 4). Our approach can then be interpreted as finding the mapping such that the implied deformations benefit classification performance."

      "heading" : "3.3 Geometrical motivation",
      "text" : "The deformation implied by mapping points in a tangent space has been first stated as the exponential metric increasing (EMI) property in Bhatia (2009). It gives inequalities between the Riemannian distance δr and the Euclidean distance δe in the tangent space at the identity Id.\nTheorem 1. Bhatia (2009) For each pair of points A, B in Pd, we have\nδr(A,B) ≥ δl(A,B) = ‖ log(A)− log(B)‖F .\nThe equality occurs when A, B and Id belong to the same geodesic. This property, inherited from the nonpositive curvature of Pd, implies a deformation of the shapes when using the logarithmic map.\nUsing the properties of the bijection Γ G− 1 2 (.) and with the notations in Eq. (7) and in Eq. (9), a corollary has been proposed in Yger (2013) which extends Theorem 1 to any tangent space:\nTheorem 2. (Yger, 2013) For any A, B and G in Pd, with ‖ · ‖G, the norm associated to the natural scalar product in TGPd satisfies\nδr(A,B) ≥ δGl (A,B) = ‖ logG(A)− logG(B)‖G.\nSimilarly to Theorem 1, the equality occurs when A, B and G belong to the same geodesic. From these two theorems, as illustrated in Fig. 4, it follows that changing the reference point for centering the tangent space modifies how shapes are deformed once they are mapped in this tangent space. This motivates our metric learning approach."

The dataset is composed of 50 samples in the training set and 500 samples in the test set. It is re-sampled in order to repeat the experiment 10 times and the results are reported in Tab. 1.\nIn this simple experiment, as it was foreseeable, the Euclidean distance achieves good performances. Indeed, omitting the additive noise matrix, the data generation protocol only involves a fixed orthonormal matrix Q for generating the matrices from both classes. Hence, the separation between the classes just becomes linear in terms of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices. Interestingly, the Riemannian distances (except our approach) performs badly for all cases.\nFrom this experiment, it is interesting to note that the proposed metric learning method helps the LogEuclidean distance to overcome its limitation.. Hence, the LogEuclidean distance with parameter learned by our proposed method is the best not only among the Riemannian distances but among all candidates.

Hence, for every subject, we have 72 trials (i.e. segments of signal) for each class in both training and testing. Moreover, we applied the same band-pass filtering ([8−30] Hz) in order to pre-process the raw signals.\nAs shown in literature Barachant et al. (2010, 2013); Yger (2013), for motor imagery signals, the spatial covariance matrix of the trials is a very promising feature. Based on this observation, we extracted the covariance matrix between sensors (i.e., the spatial covariance matrix) from every filtered time segment (i.e., every example to be classified).\nAlthough we could directly use our approach and try to classify samples, the performance would be poor since this dataset is known to show some non-stationarity between sessions. In order to cope with this problem, we employ an adaptive kernel formulation proposed in Barachant et al. (2013). This method cancels the non-stationarity in the data by whitening the covariance matrices in the training session and test session by subtracting the Riemannian mean of the training and test datasets, respectively. In practice, whitening is carried out by first applying the congruent transformation Γ\nX̄− 1 2 (·), where X̄ is the Riemannian mean of the data set. As illustrated in Fig. 5, this whitening process has the effect of spreading the covariance matrices from both training and test dataset around the identity matrix. For a dataset spread around X̄ , this has the effect of “transporting” the data on the manifold along the geodesic. For real-life applications, this whitening process can be criticized since it uses the test data. However, this can be carried out in a semi-supervised fashion by estimating X̄− 1 2 during the calibration phase. Therefore, this process would still be practical in many applications. As reported in Tab. 2, compared to other distances for handling covariance matrices, our proposed approach performs the best on 5 subjects and is never the worst.

Indeed, this function is based on the matrix logarithm whose derivative is not simple to obtain.\nTo obtain the Euclidean gradient∇f of the function f , we need Df(X)[H], its directional derivative8 at a point X and in a direction H , which is defined as:\nDf(X)[H] = lim h→0 f(X + hH)− f(X) h\n8Note that it is sometimes called Fréchet derivative.\nIn order to obtain the gradient of f , we express its directional derivative.

To our knowledge, there is no closed-form formula of this directionnal derivative but is can be evaluated numerically using the algorithm in (Boumal & Absil, 2011; Al-Mohy & Higham, 2009).\nThen, the Euclidean gradient of f at G is expressed with respect to the adjoint of Dh (G):\n∇f (G) = (Dh (G))? [Z (G)] . (15)\nHence, after some algebra (detailed in the next section), we express the adjoint as :\n〈 Z,Dh (G) [ Ġ ]〉 F = 〈 (Dh(G))?[Z(G)]︷ ︸︸ ︷∑ ij Zij∇hij (G), Ġ 〉 F . (16)\nTo sum up, using Eq.14 and Eq.13, we have : ∇f (G) = ∑ ij Zij∇hij (G) . (17)\nNote that, before solving our optimization problem on data, the validity of our Euclidean gradient formula has been numerically checked using the sanity checking tools provided in the Manopt toolbox by Boumal et al. (2014).\nA.2 Adjoint of Dh (G)\nIn order to obtain the adjoint, using the decomposition over the canonical basis Ġ = ∑\nk,l Ġklekel T, we write :〈 Z,Dh (G) [ Ġ ]〉 F (18)\n= ∑ ij Zij ( Dh (G) [ Ġ ]) ij (19)\n= ∑ ij 〈 ∇hij (G) , Ġ 〉 F Zij (20)\n= ∑ kl ∑ ij 〈 ∇hij (G) , Zijekel T 〉 F Ġkl (21) = ∑ kl ∑ ij Zij∇hij (G)  kl Ġkl (22)\n= 〈 (Dh(G))?[Z(G)]︷ ︸︸ ︷∑ ij Zij∇hij (G), Ġ 〉 F\n(23)\nA.3 Extra numerical experiments We also report the numerical experiments of a simpler toy experiment. In this experiment, the data are generated in the same way :\nX =Qdiag(λ1, . . . , λr, µ1, . . . , µr)Q>\n+V diag(| 1|, . . . , | 2r|)V >\nwith Q and V , two random orthonormal square matrices, and λi ∼ N (5, 0.2) or λi ∼ N (4, 0.1) respectively for the positive and negative classes and µi ∼ U([1, 3]) and i ∼ N (0, 1) independently of the class.\nThe difference between those two experiments resides in the range in which the variables µi are sampled. Here, the range of the uniform distribution is smaller and this toy dataset becomes easier to classify.\nThe datasets were composed of 50 examples in the training set and 500 in test and every experiment was repeated 10 times.\nIn this simple experiment, as in the other toy experiment, the Euclidean distance achieves the best performances for the same reasons.\nEven if the Euclidean distance seems to be the most suited to those data, this toy experiment is interesting. Indeed, among the distances respecting the Riemannian geometry of the data (namely the LogEuclidean and Riemannian distances), the LogEuclidean distance parametrized by our approach performs the best. Optimizing the reference point G (with respect to a KTA criterion) seems to diminish the impact of the uninformative variables µ.\nNote that in this experiment, the results of all approaches (including the Riemannian approaches) improves as the dimensionality grows. Contrary to the results reported in 1, in this experiment, the level of information is higher than the level of noise in the data. Hence, the more dimension we add, the easier it becomes to classify."

In this paper, we address the problem of metric learning for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices such as covariance matrices, which arise in many real-world applications. Naively using standard Mahalanobis metric learning methods under the Euclidean geometry for SPD matrices is not appropriate, because the difference of SPD matrices can be a non-SPD matrix and thus the obtained solution can be uninterpretable. To cope with this problem, we propose to use a properly parameterized LogEuclidean distance and optimize the metric with respect to kernel-target alignment, which is a supervised criterion for kernel learning. Then the resulting non-trivial optimization problem is solved by utilizing the Riemannian geometry. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our LogEuclidean metric learning algorithm on real-world classification tasks for EEG signals and texture patches.",
