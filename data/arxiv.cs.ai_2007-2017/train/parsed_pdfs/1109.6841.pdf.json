      "text" : "Our goal is to learn a semantic parser from question-answer pairs instead, where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. Motivated by this challenging learning problem, we develop a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which has favorable linguistic, statistical, and computational properties. We define a log-linear distribution over DCS logical forms and estimate the parameters using a simple procedure that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks, our system outperforms all existing stateof-the-art systems, despite using no annotated logical forms."

      "text" : "One of the major challenges in NLP is building systems that both handle complex linguistic phenomena and require minimal human effort. The difficulty of achieving both criteria is particularly evident in training semantic parsers, where annotating linguistic expressions with their associated logical forms is expensive but seemingly unavoidable. In this article, we overcome these limitations by developing new techniques that can learn rich semantic representations from weak supervision.\nWhat is the total population of the ten largest cities in California?\ncity\nSan Francisco Chicago Boston · · ·\nloc\nMount Shasta California San Francisco California Boston Massachusetts · · · · · ·\n>\n7 3 5 0 18 2 · · · · · ·\nstate\nAlabama Alaska Arizona · · ·\npopulation\nLos Angeles 3.8 million San Francisco 805,000 Boston 617,000 · · · · · ·\ncount\n{} 0 {1,4} 2 {2,5,6} 3 · · · · · ·\nSystem\n?\nFigure 1: The concrete objective: a system that answers natural language questions given a structured database of facts.

The problem of\nar X\niv :1\n10 9.\n68 41\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 3\n0 Se\np 20\n11\nbuilding natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) has a long history in NLP, starting from the early days of AI with systems such as Lunar (Woods et al., 1972), Chat-80 (Warren and Pereira, 1982), and many others (see Androutsopoulos et al. (1995) for an overview). While quite successful in their respective limited domains, because these systems were constructed from manually-built rules, they became difficult to scale up, both to other domains and to more complex utterances. In response, against the backdrop of a statistical revolution in NLP during the 1990s, researchers began to build systems that could learn from examples, with the hope of overcoming the limitations of rule-based methods. One of the earliest statistical efforts was the Chill system (Zelle and Mooney, 1996), which learned a shift-reduce semantic parser. Since then, there has been a healthy line of work yielding increasingly more accurate semantic parsers by using new semantic representations and machine learning techniques (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Miller et al., 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001; Ge and Mooney, 2005; Kate et al., 2005; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Kate and Mooney, 2006; Wong and Mooney, 2006; Kate and Mooney, 2007; Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007; Wong and Mooney, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010, 2011).\nHowever, while statistical methods provided advantages such as robustness and portability, their application in semantic parsing achieved only limited success. One of the main obstacles was that these methods depended crucially on having examples of utterances paired with logical forms, and this requires substantial human effort to obtain. Furthermore, the annotators must be proficient in some formal language, which drastically reduces the size of the annotator pool, dampening any hope of acquiring enough data to fulfill the vision of learning highly accurate systems.\nIn response to these concerns, researchers have recently begun to explore the possibility of learning a semantic parser without any annotated logical forms (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011; Goldwasser et al., 2011; Artzi and Zettlemoyer, 2011). It is in this vein that we develop our present work. Specifically, given a set of (x, y) example pairs, where x is an utterance (e.g., a question) and y is the corresponding answer, we wish to learn a mapping from x to y. What makes this mapping particularly interesting is it passes through a latent logical form z, which is necessary to capture the semantic complexities of natural language. Also note that while the logical form z was the end goal in past work on semantic parsing, for us, it is just an intermediate variable—a means towards an end. Figure 2 shows the graphical model which captures the learning setting we just described: The question x, answer y, and world/database w are all observed. We want to infer the logical forms z and the parameters θ of the semantic parser, which are unknown quantities.\nWhile liberating ourselves from annotated logical forms reduces cost, it does increase the difficulty of the learning problem. The core challenge here is program induction: on each example (x, y), we need to efficiently search over the exponential space of possible logical forms z and find ones that produces the target answer y, a computationally daunting task. There is also a statistical challenge: how do we parametrize the mapping from utterance x to logical form z so that it can be learned from only the indirect signal y? To address these two challenges, we must first discuss the issue of semantic representation. There are two basic questions here: (i) what should the formal language for the logical forms z be, and (ii) what are the compositional mechanisms for constructing those logical forms?\nThe semantic parsing literature is quite multilingual with respect to the formal language used for the logical form: Researchers have used SQL (Giordani and Moschitti, 2009), Prolog (Zelle and Mooney, 1996; Tang and Mooney, 2001), a simple functional query language called FunQL (Kate et al., 2005), and lambda calculus (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), just to name a few. The construction mechanisms are equally diverse, including synchronous grammars (Wong and Mooney, 2007), hybrid trees (Lu et al., 2008), Combinatorial Categorial Grammars (CCG) (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005), and shift-reduce derivations (Zelle and Mooney, 1996). It is worth pointing out that the choice of formal language and the construction mechanism are decisions which are really more orthogonal than is often assumed—the former is concerned with what the logical forms look like; the latter, with how to generate a set of possible logical forms compositionally given an utterance. (How to score these logical forms is yet another dimension.)\nExisting systems are rarely based on the joint design of the formal language and the construction mechanism; one or the other is often chosen for convenience from existing implementations. For example, Prolog and SQL have often been chosen as formal languages for convenience in end applications, but they were not designed for representing the semantics of natural language, and, as a result, the construction mechanism\n[0.3,−0.7, 4.5, 1.2, . . . ]\ncity\nSan Francisco Chicago Boston · · ·\nloc\nMount Shasta California San Francisco California Boston Massachusetts · · · · · ·\n>\n7 3 5 0 18 2 · · · · · ·\nstate Alabama Alaska Arizona · · ·\npopulation\nLos Angeles 3.8 million San Francisco 805,000 Boston 617,000 · · · · · ·\ncount\n{} 0 {1,4} 2 {2,5,6} 3 · · · · · ·\n(parameters) (world)\nthat bridges the gap between natural language and formal language is generally complex and difficult to learn. CCG (Steedman, 2000) and more generally, categorial grammar, is the de facto standard in linguistics. In CCG, logical forms are constructed compositionally using a small handful of combinators (function application, function composition, and type raising). For a wide range of canonical examples, CCG produces elegant, streamlined analyses, but its success really depends on having a good, clean lexicon. During learning, there is often large amounts of uncertainty over the lexical entries, which makes CCG more cumbersome. Furthermore, in real-world applications, we would like to handle disfluent utterances, and this further strains CCG by demanding either extra type-raising rules and disharmonic combinators (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) or a proliferation of redundant lexical entries for each word (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010).\nTo cope with the challenging demands of program induction, we break away from tradition in favor of a new formal language and construction mechanism, which we call dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS). The guiding principle behind DCS is to provide a simple and intuitive framework for constructing and representing logical forms. Logical forms in DCS are tree structures called DCS trees. The motivation is two-fold: (i) DCS trees are meant to parallel syntactic dependency trees, which facilitates parsing; and (ii) a DCS tree essentially encodes a constraint satisfaction problem, which can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. In addition, DCS provides a mark-execute construct, which provides a uniform way of dealing with scope variation, a major source of trouble in any semantic formalism. The construction mechanism in DCS is a generalization of labeled dependency parsing, which leads to simple and natural algorithms. To a linguist, DCS might appear unorthodox, but it is important to keep in mind that our primary goal is effective program induction, not necessarily to model new linguistic phenomena in the tradition of formal semantics.\nArmed with our new semantic formalism, DCS, we then define a discriminative probabilistic model, which\nis depicted in Figure 2. The semantic parser is a log-linear distribution over DCS trees z given an utterance x. Notably, z is unobserved, and we instead observe only the answer y, which is obtained by evaluating z on a world/database w. There are an exponential number of possible trees z, and usually dynamic programming is employed for efficiently searching over the space of these combinatorial objects. However, in our case, we must enforce the global constraint that the tree generates the correct answer y, which makes dynamic programming infeasible. Therefore, we resort to beam search and learn our model with a simple procedure which alternates between beam search and optimizing a likelihood objective restricted to those beams. This yields a natural bootstrapping procedure in which learning and search are integrated.\nWe evaluated our DCS-based approach on two standard benchmarks, Geo, a US geography domain (Zelle and Mooney, 1996) and Jobs, a job queries domain (Tang and Mooney, 2001). On Geo, we found that our system significantly outperforms previous work that also learns from answers instead of logical forms (Clarke et al., 2010). What is perhaps a more significant result is that our system even outperforms state-of-the-art systems that do rely on annotated logical forms. This demonstrates that the viability of training accurate systems with much less supervision than before.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), our new semantic formalism. Section 3 presents our probabilistic model and learning algorithm. Section 4 provides an empirical evaluation of our methods. Finally, Section 5 situates this work in a broader context."

To do this, we need to define the syntax and semantics of the formal language. The syntax is defined in Section 2.2 and is quite straightforward: The logical forms in the formal language are simply trees, which we call DCS trees. In Section 2.3, we give a type-theoretic definition of worlds (also known as databases or models) with respect to which we can define the semantics of DCS trees.\nThe semantics, which is the heart of this article, contains two main ideas: (i) using trees to represent logical forms as constraint satisfaction problems or extensions thereof, and (ii) dealing with cases when syntactic and semantic scope diverge (e.g., for generalized quantification and superlative constructions) using a new construct which we call mark-execute. We start in Section 2.4 by introducing the semantics of a basic version of DCS which focuses only on (i) and then extend it to the full version (Section 2.5) to account for (ii).\nFinally, having fully specified the formal language, we describe a construction mechanism for mapping a natural language utterance to a set of candidate DCS trees (Section 2.6)."

For our purposes, there is no functional difference between tuples and arrays; the distinction is convenient when we start to talk about arrays of tuples.\n• Let P be a set of predicates. We assume that P always contains a special null predicate ø and several domain-independent predicates (e.g., count, <, >, and =). In addition, P contains domain-specific predicates. For example, for the US geography domain, P would include state, river, border, etc. Right now, think of predicates as just labels, which have yet to receive formal semantics.\n• Let R be the set of relations. The full set of relations are shown in Table 1; note that unlike the predicates P, the relations R are fixed.\nThe logical forms in DCS are called DCS trees. A DCS tree is a directed rooted tree in which nodes are labeled with predicates and edges are labeled with relations; each node also maintains an ordering over its children. Formally:\nDefinition 1 (DCS trees) Let Z be the set of DCS trees, where each z ∈ Z consists of (i) a predicate z.p ∈ P and (ii) a sequence of edges z.e = (z.e1, . . . , z.em). Each edge e consists of a relation e.r ∈ R (see Table 1) and a child tree e.c ∈ Z.\nWe will either draw a DCS tree graphically or write it compactly as 〈p; r1 : c1; . . . ; rm : cm〉 where p is the predicate at the root node and c1, . . . , cm are its m children connected via edges labeled with relations r1, . . . , rm, respectively. Figure 4(a) shows an example of a DCS tree expressed using both graphical and compact formats.\nA DCS tree is a logical form, but it is designed to look like a syntactic dependency tree, only with predicates in place of words. As we’ll see over the course of this section, it is this transparency between syntax and semantics provided by DCS which leads to a simple and streamlined compositional semantics suitable for program induction."

      "text" : "To define a world, we start by constructing a set of values V. The exact set of values depend on the domain (we will continue to use US geography as a running example). Briefly, V contains numbers (e.g., 3 ∈ V), strings (e.g., Washington ∈ V), tuples (e.g., (3,Washington) ∈ V), sets (e.g., {3,Washington} ∈ V), and other higher-order entities.\nTo be more precise, we construct V recursively. First, define a set of primitive values V?, which includes the following:\n• Numeric values: each value has the form x : t ∈ V?, where x ∈ R is a real number and t ∈ {number, ordinal, percent, length, . . . } is a tag. The tag allows us to differentiate 3, 3rd, 3%, and 3 miles—this will be important in Section 2.6.3. We simply write x for the value x :number.\n• Symbolic values: each value has the form x : t ∈ V?, where x is a string (e.g., Washington) and t ∈ {string, city, state, river, . . . } is a tag. Again, the tag allows us to differentiate, for example, the entities Washington :city and Washington :state.\nNow we build the full set of values V from the primitive values V?. To define V, we need a bit more machinery: To avoid logical paradoxes, we construct V in increasing order of complexity using types (see Carpenter (1998) for a similar construction). The casual reader can skip this construction without losing any intuition.\nDefine the set of types T to be the smallest set that satisfies the following properties:\n1. The primitive type ? ∈ T ;\n2. The tuple type (t1, . . . , tk) ∈ T for each k ≥ 0 and each non-tuple type ti ∈ T for i = 1, . . . , k; and\n3. The set type {t} ∈ T for each tuple type t ∈ T .\nNote that {?}, {{?}}, and ((?)) are not valid types. For each type t ∈ T , we construct a corresponding set of values Vt:\n1. For the primitive type t = ?, the primitive values V? have already been specified. Note that these types are rather coarse: Primitive values with different tags are considered to have the same type ?.\n2. For a tuple type t = (t1, . . . , tk), Vt is the cross product of the values of its component types:\nVt = {(v1, . . . , vk) : ∀i, vi ∈ Vti}. (1)\n3. For a set type t = {t′}, Vt contains all subsets of its element type t′:\nVt = {s : s ⊂ Vt′}. (2)\nNote that all elements of the set must have the same type.\nLet V = ∪t∈T Vt be the set of all possible values. A world maps each predicate to its semantics, which is a set of tuples (see Figure 3 for an example). First, let Ttuple ⊂ T be the tuple types, which are the ones of the form (t1, . . . , tk). Let V{tuple} denote all the sets of tuples (with the same type):\nV{tuple} def = ⋃ t∈Ttuple V{t}. (3)\nNow we define a world formally:\nDefinition 2 (World) A world w : P 7→ V{tuple} ∪ {V} is a function that maps each non-null predicate p ∈ P\\{ø} to a set of tuples w(p) ∈ V{tuple} and maps the null predicate ø to the set of all values (w(ø) = V).\nFor a set of tuples A with the same arity, let Arity(A) = |x|, where x ∈ A is arbitrary; if A is empty, then Arity(A) is undefined. Now for a predicate p ∈ P and world w, define Arityw(p), the arity of predicate p with respect to w, as follows:\nArityw(p) =\n{ 1 if p = ø,\nArity(w(p)) if p 6= ø. (4)\nThe null predicate has arity 1 by fiat; the arity of a non-null predicate p is inherited from the tuples in w(p).\nRemarks In higher-order logic and lambda calculus, we construct function types and values, whereas in DCS, we construct tuple types and values. The two are equivalent in representational power, but this discrepancy does point at the fact that lambda calculus is based on function application, whereas DCS, as we will see, is based on declarative constraints. The set type {(?, ?)} in DCS corresponds to the function type ?→ (?→ bool). In DCS, there is no explicit bool type—it is implicitly represented by using sets."

(7)\nTo shorten notation, we use state abbreviations (e.g., CA = California :state). The world w also specifies the semantics of several domain-independent predicates (think of these as helper functions), which usually correspond to an infinite set of tuples. Functions are represented in DCS by a set of input-output pairs. For example, the semantics of the countt predicate (for each type t ∈ T ) contains pairs of sets S and their cardinalities |S|:\nw(countt) = {(S, |S|) : S ∈ V{(t)}} ∈ V{({(t)},?)}. (8)\nAs another example, consider the predicate averaget (for each t ∈ T ), which takes a set of key-value pairs (with keys of type t) and returns the average value. For notational convenience, we treat an arbitrary set of pairs S as a set-valued function: We let S1 = {x : (x, y) ∈ S} denote the domain of the function, and abusing notation slightly, we define the function S(x) = {y : (x, y) ∈ S} to be the set of values y that co-occur with the given x. The semantics of averaget contains pairs of sets and their averages:\nw(averaget) = (S, z) : S ∈ V{(t,?)}, z = |S1|−1 ∑ x∈S1 |S(x)|−1 ∑ y∈S(x) y  ∈ V{({(t,?)},?)}. (9)\nSimilarly, we can define the semantics of argmint and argmaxt, which each takes a set of key-value pairs and returns the keys that attain the smallest (largest) value:\nw(argmint) = { (S, z) : S ∈ V{(t,?)}, z ∈ argmin\nx∈S1 minS(x)\n} ∈ V{({(t,?)},t)}, (10)\nw(argmaxt) = { (S, z) : S ∈ V{(t,?)}, z ∈ argmax\nx∈S1 maxS(x)\n} ∈ V{({(t,?)},t)}. (11)\nThese helper functions are monomorphic: For example, countt only computes cardinalities of sets of type {(t)}. In practice, we mostly operate on sets of primitives (t = ?). To reduce notation, we omit t to refer to this version: count = count?, average = average?, etc."

In this case, z encodes a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) as follows: For each node x in z, the CSP has a variable a(x); the collection of these variables is referred to as an assignment a.

Next, for a node x, define V (x) = {a(x) : assignment a is feasible} as the set of feasible values for x—these are the ones which are consistent with at least one feasible assignment. Finally, we define the denotation of the DCS tree z with respect to the world w to be JzKw = V (x0), where x0 is the root node of z.\nFigure 4(a) shows an example of a DCS tree. The corresponding CSP has four variables c,m, `, s.2 In Figure 4(b), we have written the equivalent lambda calculus formula. The non-root nodes are existentially quantified, the root node c is λ-abstracted, and all constraints introduced by predicates and relations are conjoined. The λ-abstraction of c represents the fact that the denotation is the set of feasible values for c (note the equivalence between the boolean function λc.p(c) and the set {c : p(c)}).\nRemarks Note that CSPs only allow existential quantification and conjunction. Why did we choose this particular logical subset as a starting point, rather than allowing universal quantification, negation, or disjunction? There seems to be something fundamental about this subset, which also appears in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Kamp et al., 2005). Briefly, logical forms in DRT are called Discourse Representation Structures (DRSes), each of which contains (i) a set of existentiallyquantified discourse referents (variables), (ii) a set of conjoined discourse conditions (constraints), and (iii) nested DRSes. If we exclude nested DRSes, a DRS is exactly a CSP.3 The default existential quantification and conjunction are quite natural for modeling cross-sentential anaphora: New variables can be added to\n2Technically, the node is c and the variable is a(c), but we use c to denote the variable to simplify notation. 3DRSes are not necessarily tree-structured, though economical DRT (Bos, 2009) imposes a tree-like restriction on DRSes\nfor computational reasons.\na DRS and connected to other variables. Indeed, DRT was originally motivated by these phenomena (see Kamp and Reyle (1993) for more details).\nTree-structured CSPs can capture unboundedly complex recursive structures—such as cities in states that border states that have rivers that. . . . Trees are limited, however, in that they are unable to capture long-distance dependencies such as those arising from anaphora. For example, consider the phrase a state with a river that traverses its capital. Here, its binds to state, but this dependence cannot be captured in a tree structure. A solution to this problem can be pursued within the fuller formalism of CSPs and their realization as graphical models; we simply introduce an edge between the its node and the state node which introduces a CSP constraint that the two nodes must be equal. We will not pursue an exploration of non-tree structures in the current article, but it should be noted that such an extension is possible and quite natural."

      "text" : "So far, we have given a declarative definition of the denotation JzKw of a DCS tree z with only join relations. Now we will show how to compute JzKw efficiently. Recall that the denotation is the set of feasible values for the root node. In general, finding the solution to a CSP is NP-hard, but for trees, we can exploit dynamic programming (Dechter, 2003). The key is that the denotation of a tree depends on its subtrees only through their denotations:\nJ 〈 p; j1 j′1 :c1; · · · ; jmj′m :cm 〉 K w = w(p) ∩ m⋂ i=1 {v : vji = tj′i , t ∈ JciKw}. (12)\nOn the right-hand side of (12), the first term w(p) is the set of values that satisfy the node constraint, and the second term consists of an intersection across all m edges of {v : vji = tj′i , t ∈ JciKw}, which is the set of values v which satisfy the edge constraint with respect to some value t for the child ci.\nTo further flesh out this computation, we express (12) in terms of two operations: join and project. Join takes a cross product of two sets of tuples and retains the resulting tuples that match the join constraint:\nA ./j,j′ B = {u+ v : u ∈ A, v ∈ B, uj = v′j}. (13)\nProject takes a set of tuples and retains a fixed subset of the components:\nA[i] = {vi : v ∈ A}. (14)\nThe denotation in (12) can now be expressed in terms of these join and project operations: J 〈 p; j1 j′1 :c1; · · · ; jmj′m :cm 〉 K w = ((w(p) ./j1,j′1 Jc1Kw)[i] · · · ./jm,j′m JcmKw)[i], (15)\nwhere i = (1, . . . ,Arityw(p)). Projecting onto i retains only components corresponding to p. The time complexity for computing the denotation of a DCS tree JzKw scales linearly with the number of nodes, but there is also a dependence on the cost of performing the join and project operations. For details on how we optimize these operations and handle infinite sets of tuples, see Liang (2011) .\nThe denotation of DCS trees is defined in terms of the feasible values of a CSP, and the recurrence in (12) is only one way of computing this denotation. However, in light of the extensions to come, we now consider (12) as the actual definition rather than just a computational mechanism. It will still be useful to refer to the CSP in order to access the intuition of using declarative constraints."

For example, consider the phrase number of major cities. Suppose that number corresponds to the count predicate, and that major cities maps to the DCS tree 〈city; 11 :〈major〉〉. We cannot simply join count with the root of this DCS tree because count needs to be joined with the set of major cities (the denotation of 〈city; 11 :〈major〉〉), not just a single city.\nWe therefore introduce the aggregate relation (Σ) that takes a DCS subtree and reifies its denotation so that it can be accessed by other nodes in its entirety. Consider a tree 〈Σ:c〉, where the root is connected to a child c via Σ. The denotation of the root is simply the singleton set containing the denotation of c:\nJ〈Σ:c〉Kw = {(JcKw)}. (16)\nFigure 5(a) shows the DCS tree for our running example. The denotation of the middle node is {(s)}, where s is all major cities. Everything above this node is an ordinary CSP: s constrains the count node, which in turns constrains the root node to |s|. Figure 5(b) shows another example of using the aggregate relation Σ. Here, the node right above Σ is constrained to be a set of pairs of major cities and their populations. The average predicate then computes the desired answer.\nExample: most populous city\nTo represent logical disjunction in natural language, we use the aggregate relation and two predicates, union and contains, which are defined in the expected way:\nw(union) = {(S,B,C) : C = A ∪B}, (17) w(contains) = {(A, x) : x ∈ A}. (18)\nFigure 5(c) shows an example of a disjunctive construction: We use the aggregate relations to construct two sets, one containing Oregon, and the other containing states bordering Oregon. We take the union of these two sets; contains takes the set and reads out an element, which then constrains the city node.\nRemarks A DCS tree that contains only join and aggregate relations can be viewed as a collection of tree-structured CSPs connected via aggregate relations. The tree structure still enables us to compute denotations efficiently based on the recurrences in (15) and (16).\nRecall that a DCS tree with only join relations is a DRS without nested DRSes. The aggregate relation corresponds to the abstraction operator in DRT and is one way of making nested DRSes. It turns out that the abstraction operator is sufficient to obtain the full representational power of DRT, and subsumes generalized quantification and disjunction constructs in DRT. By analogy, we use the aggregate relation to handle disjunction (Figure 5(c)) and generalized quantification (Section 2.5.6).\nDCS restricted to join relations is less expressive than first-order logic because it does not have universal quantification, negation, and disjunction. The aggregate relation is analogous to lambda abstraction, and in basic DCS we use the aggregate relation to implement those basic constructs using higher-order predicates such as not,every, and union. We can also express logical statements such as generalized quantification, which go beyond first-order logic."

      "text" : "Basic DCS allows only join and aggregate relations, but is already quite expressive. However, it is not enough to simply express a denotation using an arbitrary logical form; one logical form can be better than another even if the two are semantically equivalent. For example, consider the superlative construction most populous city, which has a basic syntactic dependency structure shown in Figure 6(a). Figure 6(b)\nshows a DCS tree with only join and aggregate relations that expresses the correct semantics. However, the two structures are quite divergent—the syntactic head is city and the semantic head is argmax. This divergence runs counter to a principal desideratum of DCS, which is to create a transparent interface between syntax and semantics.\nIn this section, we resolve this dilemma by introducing mark and execute relations, which will allow us to use the DCS tree in Figure 6(c) to represent the semantics associated with Figure 6(a). The focus of this section is on this mark-execute construct—using mark and execute relations to give proper semanticallyscoped denotations to syntactically-scoped tree structures.\nThe basic intuition of the mark-execute construct is as follows: We mark a node low in the tree with a mark relation; then, higher up in the tree, we invoke it with a corresponding execute relation (Figure 7). For our example in Figure 6(c), we mark the population node, which puts the child argmax in a temporary store; when we execute the city node, we fetch the superlative predicate argmax from the store and invoke it.\nThis divergence between syntactic and semantic scope arises in other linguistic contexts besides superlatives such as quantification and negation. In each of these cases, the general template is the same: a syntactic modifier low in the tree needs to have semantic force higher in the tree. A particularly compelling case of this divergence happens with quantifier scope ambiguity (e.g., Some river traverses every city.), where the quantifiers appear in fixed syntactic positions, but the wide or narrow reading correspond to different semanticallyscoped denotations. Analogously, a single syntactic structure involving superlatives can also yield two different semantically-scoped denotations—the absolute and relative readings (e.g., state bordering the largest state). The mark-execute construct provides a unified framework for dealing all these forms of divergence between syntactic and semantic scope. See Figure 8 for concrete examples of this construct."

      "text" : "We now formalize the mark-execute construct. We saw that the mark-execute construct appears to act non-locally, putting things in a store and retrieving them later. This means that if we want the denotation of a DCS tree to only depend on the denotations of its subtrees, the denotations need to contain more than the set of feasible values for the root node, as was the case for basic DCS. We need to augment denotations to include information about all marked nodes, since these can be accessed by an execute relation higher up in the tree.\nMore specifically, let z be a DCS tree and d = JzKw be its denotation. The denotation d consists of n columns, where each column is either the root node of z or a non-executed marked node in z. In the example in Figure 9, there are two columns, one for the root state node and the other for size node, which is marked by c. The columns are ordered according to a pre-order traversal of z, so column 1 always corresponds to the root node. The denotation d contains a set of arrays d.A, where each array represents a feasible assignment of values to the columns of d. For example, in Figure 9, the first array in d.A corresponds to assigning (OK)\nCalifornia borders which states?\nx1\n2\n1\n1\n1 CA\ne ∗∗\nstate\nborder\n∗∗ Alaska borders no states.\nx1\n2\n1\n1\n1 AK\nq\nno\nstate\nborder\n∗∗ Some river traverses every city.\nx12\n2\n1\n1\n1\nq\nsome\nriver\nq\nevery\ncity\ntraverse\n∗∗ x21\n2\n1\n1\n1\nq\nsome\nriver\nq\nevery\ncity\ntraverse\n∗∗\n(narrow) (wide)\n(a) Extraction (e) (b) Quantification (q) (c) Quantifier scope ambiguity (q,q)\nto the state node (column 1) and (TX, 2.7e5) to the size node (column 2). If there are no marked nodes, d.A is basically a set of tuples, which corresponds to a denotation in basic DCS. For each marked node, the denotation d also maintains a store with information to be retrieved when that marked node is executed. A store σ for a marked node contains the following: (i) the mark relation σ.r (c in the example), (ii) the base denotation σ.b which essentially corresponds to denotation of the subtree rooted at the marked node excluding the mark relation and its subtree (J〈size〉Kw in the example), and (iii) the denotation of the child of the mark relation (J〈argmax〉Kw in the example). The store of any non-marked nodes (e.g., the root) is\nempty (σ = ø).\nDefinition 3 (Denotations) Let D be the set of denotations, where each denotation d ∈ D consists of\n• a set of arrays d.A, where each array a = [a1, . . . , an] ∈ d.A is a sequence of n tuples; and\n• a sequence of n stores d.σ = (d.σ1, . . . , d.σn), where each store σ contains a mark relation σ.r ∈ {e,q,c, ø}, a base denotation σ.b ∈ D ∪ {ø}, and a child denotation σ.c ∈ D ∪ {ø}.\nNote that denotations are formally defined without reference to DCS trees (just as sets of tuples were in basic DCS), but it is sometimes useful to refer to the DCS tree that generates that denotation.\nFor notational convenience, we write d as 〈〈A; (r1, b1, c1); . . . ; (rn, bn, cn)〉〉. Also let d.ri = d.σi.r, d.bi = d.σi.b, and d.ci = d.σi.c. Let d{σi = x} be the denotation which is identical to d, except with d.σi = x; d{ri = x}, d{bi = x}, and d{ci = x} are defined analogously. We also define a project operation for denotations: 〈〈A;σ〉〉[i] def= 〈〈{ai : a ∈ A};σi〉〉. Extending this notation further, we use ø to denote the indices of the non-initial columns with empty stores (i > 1 such that d.σi = ø). We can then use d[−ø] to represent projecting away the non-initial columns with empty stores. For the denotation d in Figure 9, d[1] keeps column 1, d[−ø] keeps both columns, and d[2,−2] swaps the two columns.\nIn basic DCS, denotations are sets of tuples, which works quite well for representing the semantics of whquestions such as What states border Texas? But what about polar questions such as Does Louisiana border Texas? The denotation should be a simple boolean value, which basic DCS does not represent explicitly. Using our new denotations, we can represent boolean values explicitly using zero-column structures: true corresponds to a singleton set containing just the empty array (dt = 〈〈{[ ]}〉〉) and false is the empty set (df = 〈〈∅〉〉).\nHaving described denotations as n-column structures, we now give the formal mapping from DCS trees to these structures. As in basic DCS, this mapping is defined recursively over the structure of the tree. We have a recurrence for each case (the first line is the base case, and each of the others handles a different edge relation):\nJ〈p〉Kw = 〈〈{[v] : v ∈ w(p)}; ø〉〉, [base case] (19) J 〈 p; e; jj′ :c 〉 K w = J〈p; e〉Kw ./−øj,j′ JcKw, [join] (20)\nJ〈p; e; Σ:c〉Kw = J〈p; e〉Kw ./−ø∗,∗ Σ (JcKw) , [aggregate] (21) J〈p; e;xi :c〉Kw = J〈p; e〉Kw ./−ø∗,∗ Xi(JcKw), [execute] (22) J〈p; e;e :c〉Kw = M(J〈p; e〉Kw,e, JcKw), [extract] (23) J〈p; e;c :c〉Kw = M(J〈p; e〉Kw,c, JcKw), [compare] (24) J〈p;q :c; e〉Kw = M(J〈p; e〉Kw,q, JcKw).

Now, the denotation is not just a set, so we need to generalize this operation. Specifically, the aggregate operation applied to a denotation forms a set out of the tuples in the first column for each setting of the rest of the columns:\nΣ (〈〈A;σ〉〉) = 〈〈A′ ∪A′′;σ〉〉, (27) A′ = {[S(a), a2, . . . , an] : a ∈ A},\nS(a) = {a′1 : [a′1, a2, . . . , an] ∈ A}, A′′ = {[∅, a2, . . . , an] : ∀i ∈ {2, . . . , n}, [ai] ∈ σi.b.A[1],¬∃a1,a ∈ A}.\nThe aggregate operation takes the set of arrays A and produces two sets of arrays, A′ and A′′, which are unioned (note that the stores do not change). The set A′ is the one that first comes to mind: For every setting of a2, . . . , an, we construct S(a), the set of tuples a ′ 1 in the first column which co-occur with a2, . . . , an in A.\nHowever, there is another case: what happens to settings of a2, . . . , an that do not co-occur with any value of a′1 in A? Then, S(a) = ∅, but note that A′ by construction will not have the desired array [∅, a2, . . . , an]. As a concrete example, suppose A = ∅ and we have one column (n = 1). Then A′ = ∅, rather than the desired {[∅]}.\nFixing this problem is slightly tricky. There are an infinite number of a2, . . . , an which do not co-occur with any a′1 in A, so for which ones do we actually include [∅, a2, . . . , an]? Certainly, the answer to this question cannot come from A, so it must come from the stores. In particular, for each column i ∈ {2, . . . , n}, we have conveniently stored a base denotation σi.b. We consider any ai that occurs in column 1 of the arrays of this base denotation ([ai] ∈ σi.b.A[1]). For this a2, . . . , an, we include [∅, a2, . . . , an] in A′′ as long as a2, . . . , an does not co-occur with any a1. An example is given in Figure 10.\nThe reason for storing base denotations is thus partially revealed: The arrays represent feasible values of a CSP and can only contain positive information. When we aggregate, we need to access possibly empty sets of feasible values—a kind of negative information, which can only be recovered from the base denotations."

      "text" : "(22) defines the denotation of a DCS tree where the last edge of the root is an execute relation. Similar to the aggregate case (21), we recurse on the DCS tree without the last edge (〈p; e〉) and then join it to the result of applying the execute operation Xi to the denotation of the child (JcKw).\nThe execute operation Xi is the most intricate part of DCS and is what does the heavy lifting. The operation is parametrized by a sequence of distinct indices i which specifies the order in which the columns should be processed. Specifically, i indexes into the subsequence of columns with non-empty stores. We then process this subsequence of columns in reverse order, where processing a column means performing some operations depending on the stored relation in that column. For example, suppose that columns 2 and 3 are the only non-empty columns. Then X12 processes column 3 before column 2. On the other hand, X21 processes column 2 before column 3. We first define the execute operation Xi for a single column i. There are three distinct cases, depending on the relation stored in column i:\nExtraction For a denotation d with the extract relation e in column i, executing Xi(d) involves three steps: (i) moving column i to before column 1 (·[i,−i]), (ii) projecting away non-initial empty columns (·[−ø]), and (iii) removing the store (·{σ1 = ø}):\nXi(d) = d[i,−i][−ø]{σ1 = ø} if d.ri = e. (29)\nAn example is given in Figure 12. There are two main uses of extraction:\n1. By default, the denotation of a DCS tree is the set of feasible values of the root node (which occupies column 1). To return the set of feasible values of another node, we mark that node with e. Upon execution, the feasible values of that node move into column 1. See Figure 8(a) for an example.\n2. Unmarked nodes are existentially quantified and have narrower scope than all marked nodes. Therefore, we can make a node x have wider scope than another node y by marking x (with e) and executing y before x (see Figure 8(d,e) for examples). The extract relation e (in fact, any mark relation) signifies that we want to control the scope of a node, and the execute relation allows us to set that scope.\nGeneralized Quantification Generalized quantifiers (including negation) are predicates on two sets, a restrictor A and a nuclear scope B. For example,\nw(some) = {(A,B) : A ∩B > 0}, (30) w(every) = {(A,B) : A ⊂ B}, (31)\nw(no) = {(A,B) : A ∩B = ∅}, (32)\nw(most) = {(A,B) : |A ∩B| > 1 2 |A|}. (33)\nWe think of the quantifier as a modifier which always appears as the child of a q relation; the restrictor is the parent. For example, in Figure 8(b), no corresponds to the quantifier and state corresponds to the restrictor. The nuclear scope should be the set of all states that Alaska borders. More generally, the nuclear scope is the set of feasible values of the restrictor node with respect to the CSP that includes all nodes\nbetween the mark and execute relations. The restrictor is also the set of feasible values of the restrictor node, but with respect to the CSP corresponding to the subtree rooted at that node.4\nWe implement generalized quantifiers as follows: Let d be a denotation and suppose we are executing column i. We first construct a denotation for the restrictor dA and a denotation for the nuclear scope dB . For the restrictor, we take the base denotation in column i (d.bi)—remember that the base denotation represents a snapshot of the restrictor node before the nuclear scope constraints are added. For the nuclear scope, we take the complete denotation d (which includes the nuclear scope constraints) and extract column i (d[i,−i][−ø]{σ1 = ø}—see (29)). We then construct dA and dB by applying the aggregate operation to each. Finally, we join these sets with the quantifier denotation, stored in d.ci:\nXi(d) = (( d.ci ./ −ø 1,1 dA ) ./−ø2,1 dB ) [−1] if d.ri = q,where (34)\ndA = Σ (d.bi) , (35) dB = Σ (d[i,−i][−ø]{σ1 = ø}) . (36)\nWhen there is one quantifier, think of the execute relation as performing a syntactic rewriting operation, as shown in Figure 13(b). For more complex cases, we must defer to (34).\nFigure 8(c) shows an example with two interacting quantifiers. The denotation of the DCS tree before execution is the same in both readings, as shown in Figure 14. The quantifier scope ambiguity is resolved by the choice of execute relation: x12 gives the narrow reading, x21 gives the wide reading.\nFigure 8(d) shows how extraction and quantification work together. First, the no quantifier is processed for each city, which is an unprocessed marked node. Here, the extract relation is a technical trick to give city wider scope.\nComparatives and Superlatives Comparative and superlative constructions involve comparing entities, and for this, we rely on a set S of entity-degree pairs (x, y), where x is an entity and y is a numeric degree. Recall that we can treat S as a function, which maps an entity x to the set of degrees S(x) associated with x. Note that this set can contain multiple degrees. For example, in the relative reading of state bordering the largest state, we would have a degree for the size of each neighboring state.\nSuperlatives use the argmax and argmin predicates, which are defined in Section 2.3. Comparatives use the more and less predicates: w(more) contains triples (S, x, y), where x is “more than” y as measured by S; w(less) is defined analogously:\nw(more) = {(S, x, y) : maxS(x) > maxS(y)}, (37) w(less) = {(S, x, y) : minS(x) < minS(y)}. (38)\n4 Defined this way, we can only handle conservative quantifiers, since the nuclear scope will always be a subset of the restrictor. This design decision is inspired by DRT, where it provides a way of modeling donkey anaphora. We are not treating anaphora in this work, but we can handle it by allowing pronouns in the nuclear scope to create anaphoric edges into nodes in the restrictor. These constraints naturally propagate through the nuclear scope’s CSP without affecting the restrictor.\nWe use the same mark relation c for both comparative and superlative constructions. In terms of the DCS tree, there are three key parts: (i) the root x, which corresponds to the entity to be compared, (ii) the child c of a c relation, which corresponds to the comparative or superlative predicate, and (iii) c’s parent p, which contains the “degree information” (which will be described later) used for comparison. We assume that the root is marked (usually with a relation e). This forces us to compute a comparison degree for each value of the root node. In terms of the denotation d corresponding to the DCS tree prior to execution, the entity to be compared occurs in column 1 of the arrays d.A, the degree information occurs in column i of the arrays d.A, and the denotation of the comparative or superlative predicate itself is the child denotation at column i (d.ci).\nFirst, we define a concatenating function +i (d), which combines the columns i of d by concatenating the\ncorresponding tuples of each array in d.A:\n+i (〈〈A;σ〉〉) = 〈〈A′;σ′〉〉,where (39) A′ = {a(1...i1)\\i + [ai1 + · · ·+ ai|i| ] + a(i1...n)\\i : a ∈ A} σ′ = σ(1...i1)\\i + [σi1 ] + σ(i1...n)\\i.\nNote that the store of column i1 is kept and the others are discarded. As an example:\n+2,1 (〈〈{[(1), (2), (3)], [(4), (5), (6)]};σ1, σ2, σ3〉〉) = 〈〈{[(2, 1), (3)], [(5, 4), (6)]};σ2, σ3〉〉. (40)\nWe first create a denotation d′ where column i, which contains the degree information, is extracted to column 1 (and thus column 2 corresponds to the entity to be compared). Next, we create a denotation dS whose column 1 contains a set of entity-degree pairs. There are two types of degree information:\n1. Suppose the degree information has arity 2 (Arity(d.A[i]) = 2). This occurs, for example, in most populous city (see Figure 8(f)), where column i is the population node. In this case, we simply set the degree to the second component of population by projection (J〈ø〉Kw ./−ø1,2 d′). Now columns 1 and 2 contain the degrees and entities, respectively. We concatenate columns 2 and 1 (+2,1 (·)) and aggregate to produce a denotation dS which contains the set of entity-degree pairs in column 1.\n2. Suppose the degree information has arity 1 (Arity(d.A[i]) = 1). This occurs, for example, in state bordering the most states (see Figure 8(e)), where column i is the lower marked state node. In this case, the degree of an entity from column 2 is the number of different values that column 1 can take. To compute this, aggregate the set of values (Σ (d′)) and apply the count predicate. Now with the degrees and entities in columns 1 and 2, respectively, we concatenate the columns and aggregate again to obtain dS .\nHaving constructed dS , we simply apply the comparative/superlative predicate which has been patiently waiting in d.ci. Finally, the store of d’s column 1 was destroyed by the concatenation operation +2,1 (() ·), so we must restore it with ·{σ1 = d.σ1}. The complete operation is as follows:\nXi(d) = ( J〈ø〉Kw ./−ø1,2 ( d.ci ./ −ø 1,1 dS )) {σ1 = d.σ1} if d.σi = c, d.σ1 6= ø, where (41)\ndS =\n{ Σ ( +2,1 ( J〈ø〉Kw ./−ø1,2 d′ )) if Arity(d.A[i]) = 2\nΣ ( +2,1 ( J〈ø〉Kw ./−ø1,2 ( J〈count〉Kw ./−ø1,1 Σ (d′) ))) if Arity(d.A[i]) = 1,\n(42)\nd′ = d[i,−i][−ø]{σ1 = ø}. (43)\nAn example of executing the c relation is shown in Figure 15(a). As with executing a q relation, for simple cases, we can think of executing a c relation as expanding a DCS tree, as shown in Figure 15(b).\nFigure 8(e) and Figure 8(f) show examples of superlative constructions with the arity 1 and arity 2 types of degree information, respectively. Figure 8(g) shows an example of an comparative construction. Comparatives and superlatives use the same machinery, differing only in the predicate: argmax versus 〈more; 31 :TX〉 (more than Texas). But both predicates have the same template behavior: Each takes a set of entity-degree pairs and returns any entity satisfying some property. For argmax, the property is obtaining the highest degree; for more, it is having a degree higher than a threshold. We can handle generalized superlatives (the five largest or the fifth largest or the 5% largest) as well by swapping in a different predicate; the execution mechanisms defined in (41) remain the same.\nWe saw that the mark-execute machinery allows decisions regarding quantifier scope to made in a clean and modular fashion. Superlatives also have scope ambiguities in the form of absolute versus relative readings. Consider the example in Figure 8(g). In the absolute reading, we first compute the superlative in a narrow scope (the largest state is Alaska), and then connect it with the rest of the phrase, resulting in the empty set (since no states border Alaska). In the relative reading, we consider the first state as the entity we want to compare, and its degree is the size of a neighboring state. In this case, the lower state node cannot be\nset to Alaska because there are no states bordering it. The result is therefore any state that borders Texas (the largest state that does have neighbors). The two DCS trees in Figure 8(g) show that we can naturally account for this form of superlative ambiguity based on where the scope-determining execute relation is placed without drastically changing the underlying tree structure.\nRemarks All these issues are not specific to DCS; every serious semantic formalism must address them as well. Not surprisingly then, the mark-execute construct bears some resemblance to other mechanisms that operate on categorial grammar and lambda calculus, such as quantifier raising, Montague’s quantifying in, Cooper storage, and Carpenter’s scoping constructor (Carpenter, 1998). Very broadly speaking, these mechanisms delay application of the divergent element (usually a quantifier), “marking” its spot with a dummy pronoun (as in Montague’s quantifying in) or in a store (as in Cooper storage), and then “executing” the quantifier at a later point in the derivation. One subtle but important difference between mark-execute in DCS and the others is that a DCS tree (which contains the mark and execute relations) is the final logical form, and all the action happens in the computing of the denotation of this logical form. In more traditional approaches, the action happens in the construction mechanism for building the logical form; the actually logical form produced at the end of the day is quite simple. In other words, we have pushed the inevitable complexity from the construction mechanism into the semantics of the logical from. This refactoring is important because we want our construction mechanism to focus not on linguistic issues, but on purely computational and statistical ones, which ultimately determine the practical success of our system."

In this section, we formally define the construction mechanism for DCS, which takes an utterance x and produces a set of DCS trees ZL(x).\nSince we motivated DCS trees based on dependency syntax, it might be tempting to take a dependency parse tree of the utterance, replace the words with predicates, and attach some relations on the edges to produce a DCS tree. To a first approximation, this is what we will do, but we need to be a bit more flexible for several reasons: (i) some nodes in the DCS tree do not have predicates (e.g., children of a e relation or parent of an xi relation); (ii) nodes have predicates that do not correspond to words (e.g., in California cities, there is a implicit loc predicate that bridges CA and city); (iii) some words might not correspond to any predicates in our world (e.g., please); and (iv) the DCS tree might not always be aligned with the syntactic structure depending on which syntactic formalism one ascribes to. While syntax was the inspiration for the DCS formalism, we will not actually use it in construction.\nIt is also worth stressing the purpose of the construction mechanism. In linguistics, the purpose of the construction mechanism is to try to generate the exact set of valid logical forms for a sentence. We view the construction mechanism instead as simply a way of creating a set of candidate logical forms. A separate step defines a distribution over this set to favor certain logical forms over others. The construction mechanism should therefore overapproximate the set of logical forms.

For example, L might contain {(city, city), (city, state), (city, river), . . . }. Section 4.1.3 describes the lexical triggers that we use in our experiments."

      "text" : "Given a set of lexical triggers L, we will now describe a recursive mechanism for mapping an utterance x = (x1, . . . , xn) to ZL(x), a set of candidate DCS trees for x. The basic approach is reminiscent of projective labeled dependency parsing: For each span i..j of the utterance, we build a set of trees Ci,j(x). The set of trees for the span 0..n is the final result:\nZL(x) = C0,n(x). (44)\nEach set of DCS trees Ci,j(x) is constructed recursively by combining the trees of its subspans Ci,k(x) and Ck′,j(x) for each pair of split points k, k\n′ (words between k and k′ are ignored). These combinations are then augmented via a function A and filtered via a function F ; these functions will be specified later. Formally, Ci,j(x) is defined recursively as follows:\nCi,j(x) = F ( A ( {〈p〉i..j : p ∈ L(xi+1..j)} ∪ ⋃ i≤k≤k′<j a∈Ci,k(x) b∈Ck′,j(x) T1(a, b)) )) . (45)\nThis recurrence has two parts:\n• The base case: we take the phrase (sequence of words) over span i..j and look up the set of predicates p in the set of lexical triggers. For each predicate, we construct a one-node DCS tree. We also extend the definition of DCS trees in Section 2.2 to allow each node to store the indices of the span i..j that triggered the predicate at that node; this is denoted by 〈p〉i..j . This span information will be useful in Section 3.1.1, where we will need to talk about how an utterance x is aligned with a DCS tree z.\n• The recursive case: T1(a, b), which we will define shortly, that takes two DCS trees, a and b, and returns a set of new DCS trees formed by combining a and b. Figure 16 shows this recurrence graphically.\nWe now focus on how to combine two DCS trees. Define Td(a, b) as the set of DCS trees that result by making either a or b the root and connecting the other via a chain of relations and at most d trace predicates:\nTd(a, b) = T ↘ d (a, b) ∪ T ↙ d (b, a), (46)\nHere, T↘d (a, b) is the set of DCS trees where a is the root; for T ↙ d (a, b), b is the root. The former is defined recursively as follows:\nT↘0 (a, b) = ∅, (47) T↘d (a, b) = ⋃ r∈R p∈L( ) {〈a; r :b〉 , 〈a; r :〈Σ:b〉〉} ∪ T↘d−1(a, 〈p; r :b〉).\nFirst, we consider all possible relations r ∈ R and try putting r between a and b (〈a; r :b〉), possibly with an additional aggregate relation (〈a; r :〈Σ:b〉〉). Of course, R contains an infinite number of join and execute relations, but only a small finite number of them make sense: we consider join relations jj′ only for j ∈ {1, . . . ,Arity(a.p)} and j′ ∈ {1, . . . ,Arity(b.p)}, and execute relations xi for which i does not contain indices larger than the number of columns of JbKw. Next, we further consider all possible trace predicates p ∈ L( ), and recursively try to connect a with the intermediate 〈p; r :b〉, now allowing d − 1 additional predicates. See Figure 17 for an example. In the other direction, T↙d is defined similarly:\nT↙0 (a, b) = ∅, (48) T↙d (a, b) = ⋃ r∈R p∈L( ) {〈b.p; r :a; b.e〉 , 〈b.p; r :〈Σ:a〉 ; b.e〉} ∪ T↘d−1(a, 〈p; r :b〉).\nInserting trace predicates allows us to build logical forms with more predicates than are explicitly triggered by the words. This ability is useful for several reasons. Sometimes, there is a predicate not overtly expressed, especially in noun compounds (e.g., California cities). For semantically light words such as prepositions (e.g., for) it is difficult to enumerate all the possible predicates that it might trigger; it is simpler computationally to try to insert trace predicates. We can even omit lexical triggers for transitive verbs such as border because the corresponding predicate border can be inserted as a trace predicate.\nThe function T1(a, b) connects two DCS trees via a path of relations and trace predicates. The augmentation function A adds additional relations (specifically, e and/or xi) on a single DCS tree:\nA(Z) = ⋃ z∈Z xi∈R {z, 〈z;e :〈ø〉〉 , 〈xi :z〉 , 〈xi :〈z;e :〈ø〉〉〉}, (49)"

      "text" : "The construction procedure as described thus far is extremely permissive, generating many DCS trees which are obviously wrong—for example, 〈state; 11 :〈>; 21 〈3〉〉〉, which tries to compare a state with the number 3.\nThere is nothing wrong this expression syntactically: its denotation will simply be empty (with respect to the world). But semantically, this DCS tree is anomalous.\nWe cannot simply just discard DCS trees with empty denotations, because we would incorrectly rule out 〈state; 11 :〈border; 21 〈AK〉〉〉. The difference here is that even though the denotation is empty in this world, it is possible that it might not be empty in a different world where history and geology took another turn, whereas it is simply impossible to compare cities and numbers.\nNow let us quickly flesh out this intuition before falling into a philosophical discussion about possible worlds. Given a world w, we define an abstract world α(w), to be described shortly. We compute the denotation of a DCS tree z with respect to this abstract world. If at any point in the computation we create an empty denotation, we judge z to be impossible and throw it away. The filtering function F is defined as follows:5\nF (Z) = {z ∈ Z : ∀z′ subtree of z , Jz′Kα(w).A 6= ∅}. (50)\nNow we need to define the abstract world α(w). The intuition is to map concrete values to abstract values: 3 : length becomes length, Oregon : state becomes ∗ : state, and in general, primitive value x : t becomes ∗ : t. We perform abstraction on tuples componentwise, so that (Oregon :state, 3:length) becomes (∗ :state, ∗ :length). Our abstraction of sets is slightly more complex: the empty set maps to the empty set, a set containing values all with the same abstract value a maps to {a}, and a set containing values with more than one abstract value maps to a {mixed}. Finally, a world maps each predicate onto a set of (concrete) tuples; the corresponding abstract world maps each predicate onto the set of abstract tuples. Formally, the abstraction function is defined as follows:\nα(x : t) = ∗ : t, [primitive values] (51) α((v1, . . . , vn)) = (α(v1), . . . , α(vn)), [tuples] (52)\nα(A) =  ∅ if A = ∅, {α(x) : x ∈ A} if |{α(x) : x ∈ A}| = 1, {mixed} otherwise.\n[sets] (53)\nα(w) = λp.{α(x) : x ∈ w(p)}. [worlds] (54)\nAs an example, the abstract world might look like this:\nα(w)(>) = {(∗ :number, ∗ :number, ∗ :number), (∗ :length, ∗ :length, ∗ :length), . . . }, (55) α(w)(state) = {(∗ :state)}, (56)\nα(w)(AK) = {(∗ :state)}, (57) α(w)(border) = {(∗ :state, ∗ :state)}. (58)\nNow returning our motivating example at the beginning of this section, we see that the bad DCS tree has an empty abstract denotation J〈state; 11 :〈>; 21 〈3〉〉〉Kα(w) = 〈〈∅; ø〉〉. The good DCS tree has an non-empty abstract denotation: J〈state; 11 :〈border; 21 〈AK〉〉〉Kα(w) = 〈〈{(∗ :state)}; ø〉〉, as desired.\nRemarks Computing denotations on an abstract world is called abstract interpretation (Cousot and Cousot, 1977) and is very powerful framework commonly used in the programming languages community. The idea is to obtain information about a program (in our case, a DCS tree) without running it concretely, but rather just by running it abstractly. It is closely related to type systems, but the type of abstractions one uses is often much richer than standard type systems."

      "text" : "We now compare our construction mechanism with CCG (see Figure 18 for an example). The main difference is that our lexical triggers contain less information than a lexicon in a CCG. In CCG, the lexicon would have an entry such as\nmajor ` n/n : λf.λx.major(x) ∧ f(x), (59)\nwhich gives detailed information about how this word should interact with its context. However, in DCS construction, each lexical trigger only has the minimal amount of information:\nmajor ` major. (60)\nA lexical trigger specifies a pre-theoretic “meaning” of a word which does not commit to any formalisms. One advantage of this minimality is that lexical triggers could be easily obtained from non-expert supervision: One would only have to associate words with database table names (predicates).\nIn some sense, the DCS construction mechanism pushes the complexity out of the lexicon. In linguistics, this complexity usually would end up in the grammar, which would be undesirable. However, we do not have to respect this tradeoff, because the construction mechanism only produces an overapproximation, which means it is possible to have both a simple “lexicon” and a simple “grammar.”\nThere is an important but subtle rationale for this design decision. During learning, we never just have one clean lexical entry per word (as is typically assumed in formal linguistics). Rather, there are often many possible lexical entries (and to handle disfluent utterances or utterances in free word-order languages, we might actually need many of them (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010, 2011)):\nmajor ` n : λx.major(x) (61) major ` n/n : λf.λx.major(x) ∧ f(x) (62) major ` n\\n : λf.λx.major(x) ∧ f(x) (63) . . . (64)\n5 To further reduce the search space, F imposes a few additional constraints, e.g., limiting the number of columns to 2, and only allowing trace predicates between arity 1 predicates.\nNow think of a DCS lexical trigger major ` major as simply a compact representation for a set of CCG lexical entries. Furthermore, the choice of the lexical entry is made not at the initial lexical base case, but rather during the recursive construction by inserting relations between DCS subtrees. It is exactly at this point that the choice can be made, because after all, the choice is one that depends on context. The general principle is to compactly represent the indeterminacy until one can resolve it.\nType raising is a combinator in CCG that turns one logical form into another. It can be used to turn one entity into a related entity (a kind of generalized metonymy). For example, Zettlemoyer and Collins (2007) used it to allow conversion from Boston to λx.from(x, Boston). Type raising in CCG is analogous to inserting trace predicates in DCS, but there is an important distinction: Type raising is a unary operation and is unconstrained in that it changes logical forms into new ones without regard for how they will interact with the context. Inserting trace predicates is a binary operation which is constrained by the two predicates that it is mediating. In the example, from would only be inserted to combine Boston with flight. This is another instance of the general principle of delaying uncertain decisions until there is more information."

Each component j = 1, . . . , d of this vector is a feature, and φ(x, z)j is the number of times that feature occurs in (x, z). Rather than working with indices, we treat features as symbols (e.g., TriggerPred[states, state]). Each feature captures some property about (x, z) which abstracts away from the details of the specific instance and allow us to generalize to new instances that share common features.\nThe features are organized into feature templates, where each feature template instantiates a set of features. Figure 19 shows all the feature templates for a concrete example. The feature templates are as follows:\n• PredHit contains the single feature PredHit, which fires for each predicate in z.\n• Pred contains features {Pred[α(p)] : p ∈ P}, each of which fires on α(p), the abstraction of predicate p, where\nα(p) = { ∗ : t if p = x : t p otherwise.\n(67)\nThe purpose of the abstraction is to abstract away the details of concrete values such as TX = Texas : state.\n• PredRel contains features {PredRel[α(p),q] : p ∈ P,q ∈ ({↙,↘} × R)∗}. A feature fires when a node x has predicate p and is connected via some path q = (d1, r1), . . . , (dm, rm) to the lowest\ndescendant node y with the property that each node between x and y has a null predicate. Each (d, r) on the path represents an edge labeled with relation r connecting to a left (d =↙) or right (d =↘) child. If x has no children, then m = 0. The most common case is when m = 1, but m = 2 also occurs with the aggregate and execute relations (e.g., PredRel[count,↘ 11↘ Σ] fires for Figure 5(a)).\n• PredRelPred contains features {PredRelPred[α(p),q, α(p′)] : p, p′ ∈ P,q ∈ ({↙,↘} × R)∗}, which are the same as PredRel, except that we include both the predicate p of x and the predicate p′ of the descendant node y. These features do not fire if m = 0.\n• TriggerPred contains features {TriggerPred[s, p] : s ∈W ∗, p ∈ P}, where W = {it,Texas, . . . } is the set of words. Each of these features fires when a span of the utterance with words s triggers the predicate p—more precisely, when a subtree 〈p; e〉i..j exists with s = xi+1..j . Note that these lexicalized features use the predicate p rather than the abstracted version α(p).\n• TracePred contains features {TracePred[s, p, d] : s ∈W ∗, p ∈ P, d ∈ {↙,↘}}, each of which fires when a trace predicate p has been inserted over a word s. The situation is the following: Suppose we have a subtree a that ends at position k (there is a predicate in a that is triggered by a phrase with right endpoint k) and another subtree b that begins at k′. Recall that in the construction mechanism (46), we can insert a trace predicate p ∈ L( ) between the roots of a and b. Then, for every word xj in between the spans of the two subtrees (j = {k + 1, . . . , k′}), the feature TracePred[xj , p, d] fires (d =↙ if b dominates a and d =↘ if a dominates b).\n• TraceRel contains features {TraceRel[s, d, r] : s ∈ W ∗, d ∈ {↙,↘}, r ∈ R}, each of which fires when some trace predicate with parent relation r has been inserted over a word s.\n• TracePredRel contains features {TracePredRel[s, p, d, r] : s ∈ W ∗, p ∈ P, d ∈ {↙,↘}, r ∈ R}, each of which fires when a predicate p is connected via child relation r to some trace predicate over a word s.\nThese features are simple generic patterns which can be applied for modeling essentially any distribution over sequences and labeled trees—there is nothing specific to DCS at all. The first half of the feature templates (PredHit, Pred, PredRel, PredRelPred) capture properties of the tree independent of the utterance, and are similar to ones used for syntactic dependency parsing. The other feature templates (TriggerPred, TracePred, TraceRel, TracePredRel) connect predicates in the DCS tree with words in the utterance, similar to those in a model of machine translation."

Using this, we obtain the gradient of our objective function:\n∂O(θ, C) ∂θ\n= ∑\n(x,y)∈D Cy(x) 6=∅\n( Ep(z|x;Cy,θ)[φ(x, z)]− Ep(z|x;C,θ)[φ(x, z)] ) − λθ.

Note that ZL(x) (defined in (44)) grows exponentially with the length of x. This by itself is not a show stopper. Our features (Section 3.1.1) decompose along the edges of the DCS tree, so it is possible to use dynamic programming6 to compute the second expectation Ep(z|x;ZL,θ)[φ(x, z)] of (72). The problem is computing the first expectation Ep(z|x;ZyL,θ)[φ(x, z)], which sums over the subset of candidate DCS trees z satisfying the constraint JzKw = y. Though this is a smaller set, there is no efficient dynamic program for this set since the constraint does not decompose along the structure of the DCS tree. Therefore, we need to approximate ZyL, and in fact, we will approximate ZL as well so that the two expectations in (72) are coherent.\nRecall that ZL(x) was built by recursively constructing a set of DCS trees Ci,j(x) for each span i..j. In our approximation, we simply use beam search, which truncates each Ci,j(x) to include the (at most) K DCS trees with the highest score φ(x, z)>θ.

This problem leads to a natural solution: simply alternate between the two steps (Figure 20). This procedure is not guaranteed to converge, due to the heuristic nature of the beam search, but we have found it to be convergent in practice.\n6 The state of the dynamic program would be the span i..j and the head predicate over that span.\nFinally, we use the trained model with parameters θ to answer new questions x by choosing the most likely answer y, summing out the latent logical form z:\nFθ(x) def = argmax\ny p(y | x; θ, Z̃L,θ) (74)\n= argmax y ∑ z∈Z̃L,θ(x)\nJzKw=y\np(z | x; θ, Z̃L,θ).

These datasets were created by Ray Mooney’s group during the 1990s and have been used to evaluate semantic parsers for over a decade.\nUS Geography The Geo dataset, originally created by Zelle and Mooney (1996), contains 880 questions about US Geography and a database of facts encoded in Prolog. The questions in Geo ask about general properties (e.g., area, elevation, population) of geographical entities (e.g., cities, states, rivers, mountains). Across all the questions, there are 280 word types, and the length of an utterance ranges from 4 to 19 words, with an average of 8.5 words. The questions involve conjunctions, superlatives, negation, but no generalized quantification. Each question is annotated with a logical form in Prolog, for example:\nUtterance: What is the highest point in Florida? Logical form: answer(A,highest(A,(place(A),loc(A,B),const(B,stateid(florida)))))\nSince our approach learns from answers, not logical forms, we evaluated the annotated logical forms on the provided database to obtain the correct answers.\nRecall that a world/database w maps each predicate p ∈ P to a set of tuples w(p). Some predicates contain the set of tuples explicitly (e.g., mountain); others can be derived (e.g., higher takes two entities x and y\nand returns true if elevation(x) > elevation(y)). Other predicates are higher-order (e.g., sum, highest) in that they take other predicates as arguments. We do not use the provided domain-specific higher-order predicates (e.g., highest), but rather provide domain-independent higher-order predicates (e.g., argmax) and the ordinary domain-specific predicates (e.g., elevation). This provides more compositionality and therefore better generalization. Similarly, we use more and elevation instead of higher. Altogether, P contains 43 predicates plus one predicate for each value (e.g., CA).\nJob Queries The Jobs dataset (Tang and Mooney, 2001) contains 640 natural language queries about job postings. Most of the questions ask for jobs matching various criteria: job title, company, recruiter, location, salary, languages and platforms used, areas of expertise, required/desired degrees, and required/desired years of experience. Across all utterances, there are 388 word types, and the length of an utterance ranges from 2 to 23 words, with an average of 9.8 words. The utterances are mostly based on conjunctions of criteria, with a sprinkling of negation and disjunction. Here is an example:\nUtterance: Are there any jobs using Java that are not with IBM? Logical form: answer(A,(job(A),language(A,’java’),¬company(A,’IBM’)))\nThe Jobs dataset comes with a database, which we can use as the world w. However, when the logical forms are evaluated on this database, close to half of the answers are empty (no jobs match the requested criteria). Therefore, there is a large discrepancy between obtaining the correct logical form (which has been the focus of most work on semantic parsing) and obtaining the correct answer (our focus).\nTo bring these two into better alignment, we generated a random database as follows: We created m = 100 jobs. For each job j, we go through each predicate p (e.g., company) that takes two arguments, a job and a target value. For each of the possible target values v, we add (j, v) to w(p) independently with probability α = 0.8. For example, for p = company, j = job37, we might add (job37, IBM) to w(company). The result is a database with a total of 23 predicates (which includes the domain-independent ones) in addition to the value predicates (e.g., IBM).\nThe goal of using randomness is to ensure that two different logical forms will most likely yield different answers. For example, consider two logical forms:\nz1 = λj.job(j) ∧ company(j, IBM), (76) z2 = λj.job(j) ∧ language(j, Java). (77)\nUnder the random construction, the denotation of z1 is S1, a random subset of the jobs, where each job is included in S1 independently with probability α, and the denotation of z2 is S2, which has the same distribution as S1 but importantly is independent of S1. Therefore, the probability that S1 = S2 is [α\n2 + (1−α)2]m, which is exponentially small in m. This construction yields a world that is not entirely “realistic” (a job might have multiple employers), but it ensures that if we get the correct answer, we probably also obtain the correct logical form."

We run experiments on two sets of lexical triggers: base triggers Lb and augmented triggers Lb+p.\nBase Triggers The base trigger set Lb includes three types of entries:\n• Domain-independent triggers: For each domain-independent predicate (e.g., argmax), we manually specify a few words associated with that predicate (e.g., most). The full list is shown at the top of Figure 21.\n• Values: For each value x that appears in the world (specifically, x ∈ vj ∈ w(p) for some tuple v, index j, and predicate p), Lb contains an entry (x, x) (e.g., (Boston,Boston : city)). Note that this rule implicitly specifies an infinite number of triggers.\nRegarding predicate names, we do not add entries such as (city, city), because we want our system to be language-independent. In Turkish, for instance, we would not have the luxury of lexicographical cues that associate city with ehir. So we should think of the predicates as just symbols predicate1, predicate2, etc. On the other hand, values in the database are generally proper nouns (e.g., city names) for which there are generally strong cross-linguistic lexicographic similarities.\n• Part-of-speech (POS) triggers:7 For each domain-specific predicate p, we specify a set of part-of-speech tags T . Implicitly, Lb contains all pairs (x, p) where the word x has a POS tag t ∈ T . For example, for city, we would specify nn and nns, which means that any word which is a singular or plural common noun triggers the predicate city. Note that city triggers city as desired, but state also triggers city.\nThe POS triggers for Geo and Jobs domains are shown in the left side of Figure 21. Note that that some predicates such as traverse and loc are not associated with any POS tags. Predicates corresponding to verbs and prepositions are not included as overt lexical triggers, but rather included as trace predicates L( ). In constructing the logical forms, nouns and adjectives serve as anchor points. Trace predicates can be inserted in between these anchors. This strategy is more flexible than requiring each predicate to spring from some word.\n7 To perform POS tagging, we used the Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al., 2006), trained on the WSJ Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the Question Treebank (Judge et al., 2006)—thanks to Slav Petrov for providing the trained grammar.\nAugmented Triggers We now define the augmented trigger set Lb+p, which contains more domainspecific information than Lb. Specifically, for each domain-specific predicate (e.g., city), we manually specify a single prototype word (e.g., city) associated with that predicate. Under Lb+p, city would trigger only city because city is a prototype word, but town would trigger all the nn predicates (city, state, country, etc.) because it is not a prototype word.\nPrototype triggers require only a modest amount of domain-specific supervision (see the right side of Figure 21 for the entire list for Geo and Jobs). In fact, as we’ll see in Section 4.2, prototype triggers are not absolutely required to obtain good accuracies, but they give an extra boost and also improve computational efficiency by reducing the set of candidate DCS trees.\nFinally, we use a small set of rules that expand morphology (e.g., largest is mapped to most large). To determine triggering, we stem all words using the Porter stemmer Porter (1980), so that mountains triggers the same predicates as mountain."

(2010) (henceforth, CGCR10), which is most similar to our work in that it also learns from question-answer pairs without using annotated logical forms. CGCR10 works with the FunQL language and casts semantic parsing as integer linear programming (ILP). In each iteration, the learning algorithm solves the ILP to predict the logical form for each training example. The examples with correct predictions are fed to a structural SVM and the model parameters are updated.\nThough similar in spirit, there are some important differences between CGCR10 and our approach. They use ILP instead of beam search and structural SVM instead of log-linear models, but the main difference is which examples are used for learning. Our approach learns on any feasible example (Section 3.2.1), one where the candidate set contains a logical form that evaluates to the correct answer. CGCR10 uses a much more stringent criterion: the highest scoring logical form must evaluate to the correct answer. Therefore, for their algorithm to progress, the model already must be non-trivially good before learning even starts. This is reflected in the amount of prior knowledge and initialization that CGCR10 employs before learning starts: WordNet features, and syntactic parse trees, and a set of lexical triggers with 1.42 words per non-value predicate. Our system with base triggers requires only simple indicator features, POS tags, and 0.5 words per non-value predicate.\nCGCR10 created a version of Geo which contains 250 training and 250 test examples. Table 2 compares the empirical results on this split. We see that our system (LJK11) with base triggers significantly outperforms CGCR10 (84% over 73.2%), and it even outperforms the version of CGCR10 that is trained using logical forms (84.0% over 80.4%).

      "text" : "We now compare our system (LJK11) with state-of-the-art systems, which all require annotated logical forms (except Precise). Here is a brief overview of the systems:\n• Cocktail (Tang and Mooney, 2001) uses inductive logic programming to learn rules for driving the decisions of a shift-reduce semantic parser. It assumes that a lexicon (mapping from words to predicates) is provided.\n• Precise (Popescu et al., 2003) does not use learning, but instead relies on matching words to strings in the database using various heuristics based on WordNet and the Charniak parser. Like our work, it also uses database type constraints to rule out spurious logical forms. One of the unique features of Precise is that it has 100% precision—it refuses to parse an utterance which it deems semantically intractable.\n8Note that the numbers for LJK11 differ from those presented in Liang et al. (2011), which reports results based on 10 different splits rather than the setup used by CGCR10.\n• Scissor (Ge and Mooney, 2005) learns a generative probabilistic model that extends the Collins models (Collins, 1999) with semantic labels, so that syntactic and semantic parsing can be done jointly.\n• Silt (Kate et al., 2005) learns a set of transformation rules for mapping utterances to logical forms.\n• Krisp (Kate and Mooney, 2006) uses SVMs with string kernels to drive the local decisions of a chartbased semantic parser.\n• Wasp (Wong and Mooney, 2006) uses log-linear synchronous grammars to transform utterances into logical forms, starting with word alignments obtained from the IBM models.\n• λ-Wasp (Wong and Mooney, 2007) extends Wasp to work with logical forms that contain bound variables (lambda abstraction).\n• LNLZ08 (Lu et al., 2008) learns a generative model over hybrid trees, which are logical forms augmented with natural language words. IBM model 1 is used to initialize the parameters, and a discriminative reranking step works on top of the generative model.\n• ZC05 (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) learns a discriminative log-linear model over CCG derivations. Starting with a manually-constructed domain-independent lexicon, the training procedure grows the lexicon by adding lexical entries derived from associating parts of an utterance with parts of the annotated logical form.\n• ZC07 (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) extends ZC05 with extra (disharmonic) combinators to increase the expressive power of the model.\n• KZGS10 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2010) uses a restricted higher-order unification procedure, which iteratively breaks up a logical form into smaller pieces. This approach gradually adds lexical entries of increasing generality, thus obviating the need for the manually-specified templates used by ZC05 and ZC07 for growing the lexicon. IBM model 1 is used to initialize the parameters.\n• KZGS11 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2011) extends KZGS10 by factoring lexical entries into a template plus a sequence of predicates which fill the slots of the template. This factorization improves generalization.\nWith the exception of Precise, all other systems require annotated logical forms, whereas our system learns from annotated answers. On the other hand, many of the later systems require essentially no manually-crafted lexicon and instead rely on unsupervised word alignment (e.g., Wong and Mooney (2006, 2007); Kwiatkowski et al. (2010, 2011)) and/or lexicon learning (e.g., Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005, 2007); Kwiatkowski et al. (2010, 2011)). We cannot use these automatic techniques because they require annotated logical forms. Our system instead relies on lexical triggers, which does require some manual effort. These lexical triggers play a crucial role in the initial stages of learning, because they constrain the set of candidate DCS trees; otherwise we would face a hopelessly intractable search problem.\nTable 3 shows the results for Geo. Semantic parsers are typically evaluated on the accuracy of the logical forms: precision (the accuracy on utterances which are successfully parsed) and recall (the accuracy on all utterances). We only focus on recall (a lower bound on precision) and simply use the word accuracy to refer to recall.9 Our system is evaluated only on answer accuracy because our model marginalizes out the latent logical form. All other systems are evaluated on the accuracy of logical forms. To calibrate, we also evaluated KZGS10 on answer accuracy and found that it was quite similar to its logical form accuracy (88.9% versus 88.2%).10 This does not imply that our system would necessarily have a high logical form accuracy because multiple logical forms can produce the same answer, and our system does not receive a training signal to tease them apart. Even with only base triggers, our system (LJK11) outperforms all but two of the systems,\n9 Our system produces a logical form for every utterance, and thus our precision is the same as our recall. 10The 88.2% corresponds to 87.9% in Kwiatkowski et al. (2010). The difference is due to using a slightly newer version of\nthe code.\nfalling short of KZGS10 by only one point (87.9% versus 88.9%).11 With augmented triggers, our system takes the lead (91.4% over 88.9%).\nTable 4 shows the results for Jobs. The two learning-based systems (Cocktail and ZC05) are actually outperformed by Precise, which is able to use strong database type constraints. By exploiting this information and doing learning, we obtain the best results."

We classified these errors into the following categories (the number of errors in each category is shown in parentheses):\n11The 87.9% and 91.4% correspond to 88.6% and 91.1% in Liang et al. (2011). These differences are due to minor differences in the code.\n• Incorrect POS tags (8): Geo is out-of-domain for our POS tagger, so the tagger makes some basic errors which adversely affect the predicates that can be lexically triggered. For example, the question What states border states . . . is tagged as wp vbz nn nns . . . , which means that the first states cannot trigger state. In another example, major river is tagged as nnp nnp, so these cannot trigger the appropriate predicates either, and thus the desired DCS tree cannot even be constructed.\n• Non-projectivity (3): The candidate DCS trees are defined by a projective construction mechanism (Section 2.6) that prohibits edges in the DCS tree from crossing. This means we cannot handle utterances such as largest city by area, since the desired DCS tree would have city dominating area dominating argmax. To construct this DCS tree, we could allow local reordering of the words.\n• Unseen words (2): We never saw at least or sea level at training time. The former has the correct lexical trigger, but not a sufficiently large feature weight (0) to encourage its use. For the latter, the problem is more structural: We have no lexical triggers for 0 : length, and only adding more lexical triggers can solve this problem.\n• Wrong lexical triggers (7): Sometimes the error is localized to a single lexical trigger. For example, the model incorrectly thinks Mississippi is the state rather than the river, and that Rochester is the city in New York rather than the name, even though there are contextual cues to disambiguate in these cases.\n• Extra words (5): Sometimes, words trigger predicates that should be ignored. For example, for population density, the first word triggers population, which is used rather than density.\n• Over-smoothing of DCS tree (9): The first half of our features (Figure 19) are defined on the DCS tree alone; these produce a form of smoothing that encourages DCS trees to look alike regardless of the words. We found several instances where this essential tool for generalization went too far. For example, in state of Nevada, the trace predicate border is inserted between the two nouns, because it creates a structure more similar to that of the common question what states border Nevada?"

We do not look at raw feature weights, because there are complex interactions between them not represented by examining individual weights. Instead, we look at expected feature counts, which we think are more interpretable.\nConsider a group of “competing” features J , for example J = {TriggerPred[city, p] : p ∈ P}. We define a distribution q(·) over J as follows:\nq(j) = Nj∑\nj′∈J Nj′ , where (78) Nj = ∑\n(x,y)∈D\nEp(z|x,Z̃L,θ,θ)[φ(x, z)].\nThink of q(j) as a marginal distribution (since all our features are positive) which represents the relative frequencies with which the features j ∈ J fire with respect to our training dataset D and trained model p(z | x, Z̃L,θ, θ). To appreciate the difference between what this distribution and raw feature weights capture, suppose we had two features, j1 and j2, which are identical (φ(x, z)j1 ≡ φ(x, z)j2). The weights would be split across the two features, but the features would have the same marginal distribution (q(j1) = q(j2)). Figure 22 shows some of the feature distributions learned."

Infeasible examples are skipped, but an example\nmay become feasible in a later iteration. A natural question is how many training examples are feasible in each iteration. Figure 23 shows the answer: Initially, only around 30% of the training examples are feasible; this is not surprising given that all the parameters are zero, so our beam search is essentially unguided. However, training on just these examples improves the parameters, and over the next few iterations, the number of feasible examples steadily increases to around 97%.\nIn our algorithm, learning and search are deeply intertwined. Search is of course needed to learn, but learning also improves search. The general approach is similar in spirit to Searn (Daume et al., 2009), although we do not have any formal guarantees at this point.\nOur algorithm also has a bootstrapping flavor. The “easy” examples are processed first, where easy is defined by the ability of beam search to generate the correct answer. This bootstrapping occurs quite naturally: Unlike most bootstrapping algorithms, we do not have to set a confidence threshold for accepting new training examples, something that can be quite tricky to do. Instead, our threshold falls out of the discrete nature of the beam search."

Figure 24 shows the effect of the number of training examples, number of training iterations, beam size, and regularization parameter. The overall conclusion is that there are no big surprises: Our default settings could be improved on slightly, but these differences are often smaller than the variation across different development splits.\nWe now consider the choice of optimization algorithm to update the parameters given candidate sets (see Figure 20). Thus far, we have been using L-BFGS (Nocedal, 1980), which is a batch algorithm: Each iteration, we construct the candidate sets C(t)(x) for all the training examples before solving the optimization problem argmaxθO(θ, C(t)). We now consider an online algorithm, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins and Monro, 1951), which updates the parameters after computing the candidate set for each example. In particular, we iteratively scan through the training examples in a random order. For each example (x, y), we compute the candidate set using beam search. We then update the parameters in the direction of the gradient of the marginal log-likelihood for that example (see (72)) with step size t−α:\nθ(t+1) ← θ(t) + t−α ( ∂ log p(y | x; Z̃L,θ(t) , θ)\n∂θ\n∣∣∣ θ=θ(t) ) . (79)\nThe trickiest aspect of using SGD is selecting the correct step size: a small α leads to quick progress but also instability; a large α leads to the opposite. We let L-BFGS and SGD both take the same number of iterations (passes over the training set). Figure 25 shows that a very small value of α (less than 0.2) is best for our task, even though only values between 0.5 and 1 guarantee convergence. Our setting is slightly different since we are interleaving the SGD updates with beam search, which might also lead to unpredictable consequences. Furthermore, the non-convexity of the objective function exacerbates the unpredictability (Liang and Klein, 2009). Nonetheless, with a proper α, SGD converges much faster than L-BFGS and even to a slightly better solution."

      "heading" : "5.1 Semantic Representation",
      "text" : "Since the late nineteenth century, philosophers and linguists have worked on elucidating the relationship between an utterance and its meaning. One of the pillars of formal semantics is Frege’s principle of compositionality, that the meaning of an utterance is built by composing the meaning of its parts. What these parts are and how they are composed is the main question. The dominant paradigm, which stems from the seminal work of Richard Montague in the early 1970s (Montague, 1973), states that parts are lambda calculus expressions that correspond to syntactic constituents, and composition is function application.\nConsider the compositionality principle from a statistical point of view, where we construe compositionality as factorization. Factorization, the way a statistical model breaks into features, is necessary for generalization: It enables us to learn from previously seen examples and interpret new utterances. Projecting back to Frege’s original principle, the parts are the features (Section 3.1.1), and composition is the DCS construction mechanism (Section 2.6) driven by parameters learned from training examples.\nTaking the statistical view of compositionality, finding a good semantic representation becomes designing a good statistical model. But statistical modeling must also deal with the additional issue of language acquisition or learning, which presents complications: In absorbing training examples, our learning algorithm must inevitably traverse through intermediate models that are wrong or incomplete. The algorithms must therefore tolerate this degradation, and do so in a computationally efficient way. For example, in the line of work on learning probabilistic CCGs (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005, 2007; Kwiatkowski et al., 2010), many candidate lexical entries must be entertained for each word even when polysemy does not actually exist (Section 2.6.4).\nTo improve generalization, the lexicon can be further factorized (Kwiatkowski et al., 2011), but this is all done within the constraints of CCG. DCS represents a departure from this tradition, which replaces a heavily-lexicalized constituency-based formalism with a lightly-lexicalized dependency-based formalism. We can think of DCS as a shift in linguistic coordinate systems, which makes certain factorizations or features more accessible. For example, we can define features on paths between predicates in a DCS tree which capture certain lexical patterns much more easily than in a lambda calculus expression or a CCG derivation.\nDCS has a family resemblance to a semantic representation called natural logic form (Alshawi et al., 2011), which is also motivated by the benefits of working with dependency-based logical forms. The goals and the detailed structure of the two semantic formalisms are different, however. Alshawi et al. (2011) focuses on parsing complex sentences in an open domain where a structured database or world does not\nexist. While they do equip their logical forms with a full model-theoretic semantics, the logical forms are actually closer to dependency trees: quantifier scope is left unspecified, and the predicates are simply the words.\nPerhaps not immediately apparent is the fact that DCS draws an important idea from Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)—not from the treatment of anaphora and presupposition which it is known for, but something closer to its core. This is the idea of having a logical form where all variables are existentially quantified and constraints are combined via conjunction—a Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) in DRT, or a basic DCS tree with only join relations. Computationally, these logical structures conveniently encode CSPs. Linguistically, it appears that existential quantifiers play an important role and should be treated specially (Kamp and Reyle, 1993). DCS takes this core and focuses on semantic compositionality and computation, while DRT focuses more on discourse and pragmatics.\nIn addition to the statistical view of DCS as a semantic representation, it is useful to think about DCS from the perspective of programming language design. Two programming languages can be equally expressive, but what matters is how simple it is to express a desired type of computation in a given language. In some sense, we designed the DCS formal language to make it easy to represent computations expressed by natural language. An important part of DCS is the mark-execute construct, a uniform framework for dealing with the divergence between syntactic and semantic scope. This construct allows us to build simple DCS tree structures and still handle the complexities of phenomena such as quantifier scope variation. Compared to lambda calculus, think of DCS as a higher-level programming language tailored to natural language, which results in simpler programs (DCS trees). Simpler programs are easier for us to work with and easier for an algorithm to learn."

      "heading" : "5.2 Program Induction",
      "text" : "Searching over the space of programs is challenging. This is the central computational challenge of program induction, that of inferring programs (logical forms) from their behavior (denotations). This problem has been tackled by different communities in various forms: program induction in AI, programming by demonstration in HCI, and program synthesis in programming languages. The core computational difficulty is that the supervision signal—the behavior—is a complex function of the program which cannot be easily inverted. What program generated the output Arizona, Nevada, and Oregon?\nPerhaps somewhat counterintuitively, program induction is easier if we infer programs for not a single task but for multiple tasks. The intuition is that when the tasks are related, the solution to one task can help another task, both computationally in navigating the program space and statistically in choosing the appropriate program if there are multiple feasible possibilities (Liang et al., 2010). In our semantic parsing work, we want to infer a logical form for each utterance (task). Clearly the tasks are related because they use the same vocabulary to talk about the same domain.\nNatural language also makes program induction easier by providing side information (words) which can be used to guide the search. There have been several papers that induce programs in this setting: Eisenstein et al. (2009) induces conjunctive formulae from natural language instructions, Piantadosi et al. (2008) induces first-order logic formulae using CCG in a small domain assuming observed lexical semantics, and Clarke et al. (2010) induces logical forms in semantic parsing. In the ideal case, the words would determine the program predicates, and the utterance would determine the entire program compositionally. But of course, this mapping is not given and must be learned."

      "text" : "In recent years, there has been an increased interest in connecting language with the world.12 One of the primary issues in grounded language is alignment—figuring out what fragments of utterances refer to what aspects of the world. In fact, semantic parsers trained on examples of utterances and annotated logical form\n12Here, world need not refer to the physical world, but could be any virtual world. The point is that the world has non-trivial structure and exists extra-linguistically.\n(those discussed in Section 4.2.2) need to solve the task of aligning words to predicates. Some can learn from utterances paired with a set of logical forms, one of which is correct (Kate and Mooney, 2007; Chen and Mooney, 2008). Liang et al. (2009) tackles the even more difficult alignment problem of segmenting and aligning a discourse to a database of facts, where many parts on either side are irrelevant.\nIf we know how the world relates to language, we can leverage structure in the world to guide the learning and interpretation of language. We saw that type constraints from the database/world reduces the set of candidate logical forms and lead to more accurate systems (Popescu et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2011). Even for syntactic parsing, information from the denotation of an utterance can be helpful (Schuler, 2003).\nOne of the exciting aspects about using the world for learning language is that it opens the door to many new types of supervision. We can obtain answers given a world, which are cheaper to obtain than logical forms (Clarke et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011). Goldwasser et al. (2011) learns a semantic parser based on bootstrapping and estimating the confidence of its own predictions. Artzi and Zettlemoyer (2011) learns a semantic parser not from annotated logical forms, but from user interactions with a dialog system. Branavan et al. (2009, 2010, 2011) use reinforcement learning to follow natural language instructions from a reward signal. In general, supervision from the world is indirectly related to the learning task, but it is often much more plentiful and natural to obtain.\nThe benefits can also flow from language to the world. For example, previous work learned to interpret language to troubleshoot a Windows machine (Branavan et al., 2009, 2010), win a game of Civilization (Branavan et al., 2011), play a legal game of solitaire (Eisenstein et al., 2009; Goldwasser and Roth, 2011), and navigate a map by following directions (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2010; Chen and Mooney, 2011). Even when the objective in the world is defined independently of language (e.g., in Civilization), language can provide a useful bias towards the non-linguistic end goal."

      "heading" : "5.4 Conclusions",
      "text" : "The main conceptual contribution of this article is a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which has favorable linguistic, statistical, and computational properties. This enabled us to learn a semantic parser from question-answer pairs where the intermediate logical form (a DCS tree) is induced in an unsupervised manner. Our final question-answering system was able to outperform current state-of-the-art systems despite requiring no annotated logical forms.\nThere is currently a significant conceptual gap between our question-answering system (which are natural language interfaces to databases) and open-domain question-answering systems. The former focuses on understanding a question compositionally and computing the answer compositionally, while the latter focuses on retrieving and ranking answers from a large unstructured textual corpus. The former has depth; the latter has breadth. Developing methods that can both model the semantic richness of language and scale up to an open-domain setting remains an open challenge.\nWe believe that it is possible to push our approach in the open-domain direction. Neither DCS nor the learning algorithm is tied to having a clean rigid database, which could instead be a database generated from a noisy information extraction process. The key is to drive the learning with the desired behavior, the question-answer pairs. The latent variable is the logical form or program, which just tries to compute the desired answer by piecing together whatever information is available. Of course, there are many open challenges ahead, but with the proper combination of linguistic, statistical, and computational insight, we hope to eventually build systems with both breadth and depth.\nAcknowledgments We thank Luke Zettlemoyer and Tom Kwiatkowski for providing us with data and answering questions.

Our system instead relies on lexical triggers, which does require some manual effort. These lexical triggers play a crucial role in the initial stages of learning, because they constrain the set of candidate DCS trees; otherwise we would face a hopelessly intractable search problem. Table 3 shows the results for Geo. Semantic parsers are typically evaluated on the accuracy of the logical forms: precision (the accuracy on utterances which are successfully parsed) and recall (the accuracy on all utterances). We only focus on recall (a lower bound on precision) and simply use the word accuracy to refer to recall. Our system is evaluated only on answer accuracy because our model marginalizes out the latent logical form. All other systems are evaluated on the accuracy of logical forms. To calibrate, we also evaluated KZGS10 on answer accuracy and found that it was quite similar to its logical form accuracy (88.9% versus 88.2%). This does not imply that our system would necessarily have a high logical form accuracy because multiple logical forms can produce the same answer, and our system does not receive a training signal to tease them apart. Even with only base triggers, our system (LJK11) outperforms all but two of the systems, 9 Our system produces a logical form for every utterance, and thus our precision is the same as our recall. 10The 88.2% corresponds to 87.9% in Kwiatkowski et al.

The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive. Our goal is to learn a semantic parser from question-answer pairs instead, where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. Motivated by this challenging learning problem, we develop a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS), which has favorable linguistic, statistical, and computational properties. We define a log-linear distribution over DCS logical forms and estimate the parameters using a simple procedure that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks, our system outperforms all existing stateof-the-art systems, despite using no annotated logical forms.",
