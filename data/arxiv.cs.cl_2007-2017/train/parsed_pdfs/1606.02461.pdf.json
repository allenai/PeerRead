      "text" : "A major goal of semantic processing is to map natural language utterances to representations that facilitate calculation of meanings, execution of commands, and/or inference of knowledge. Formal semantics supports such representations by defining words as some functional units and combining them via a specific logic. A simple and illustrative example is the Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS) (Liang et al., 2013). DCS composes meanings from denotations of words (i.e. sets of things to which the words apply); say, the denotations of the concept drug and the event ban is shown in Figure 1b, where drug is a list of drug names and ban is a list of the subjectcomplement pairs in any ban event; then, a list of banned drugs can be constructed by first taking the COMP column of all records in ban (projection “πCOMP”), and then intersecting the results with drug (intersection “∩”). This procedure defined how words can be combined to form a meaning.\nBetter yet, the procedure can be concisely illustrated by the DCS tree of “banned drugs” (Figure 1a), which is similar to a dependency tree but possesses precise procedural and logical meaning (Section 2). DCS has been shown useful in question answering (Liang et al., 2013) and textual entailment recognition (Tian et al., 2014).\nOrthogonal to the formal semantics of DCS, distributional vector representations are useful in capturing lexical semantics of words (Turney and Pantel, 2010; Levy et al., 2015), and progress is made in combining the word vectors to form meanings of phrases/sentences (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011; Socher et al., 2012; Paperno et al., 2014; Hashimoto et al., 2014). However, less effort is devoted to finding a link between vector-based compositions and the composition operations in any formal semantics. We believe that if a link can be found, then symbolic formulas in the formal semantics will be realized by vectors composed from word embeddings, such that similar things are realized by similar vectors; meanwhile, vectors will acquire formal meanings that can directly be used in execution or inference process. Still, to find a link is challenging because any vector compositions that realize such a link must conform to the logic of the formal semantics.\nIn this paper, we establish a link between DCS and certain vector compositions, achieving a vector-based DCS by replacing denotations of words with word vectors, and realizing the composition operations such as intersection and projection as addition and linear mapping, respectively. For example, to construct a vector for “banned drugs”, one takes the word vector vban and multiply it by a matrix MCOMP, corresponding to the projection πCOMP; then, one adds the result to the word vector vdrug to realize the intersection operation (Figure 1c). We provide a method to train the\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 46\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\n6\nban COMP\ndrug ARG\nbanned drugs\nARG\nAspirin Thalidomide …\nCOMP\nalcohol Thalidomide …\nSUBJ\ngovernment Canada …\ndrug\nban\n∩ = πCOMP projection intersection\ndenotation of “banned drugs”\n(c) (d)\n(a) (b)\nalcohol Thalidomide … Thalidomide …\nword vectors and linear mappings (i.e. matrices) jointly from unlabeled corpora.\nThe rationale for our model is as follows. First, recent research has shown that additive composition of word vectors is an approximation to the situation where two words have overlapping context (Tian et al., 2015); therefore, it is suitable to implement an “and” or intersection operation (Section 3). We design our model such that the resulted distributional representations are expected to have additive compositionality. Second, when intersection is realized as addition, it is natural to implement projection as linear mapping, as suggested by the logical interactions between the two operations (Section 3). Experimentally, we show that vectors and matrices learned by our model exhibit favorable characteristics as compared with vectors trained by GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) or those learned from syntactic dependencies (Section 5.1). Finally, additive composition brings our model a strong ability to calculate similar vectors for similar phrases, whereas syntactic-semantic roles (e.g. SUBJ, COMP) can be distinguished by different projection matrices (e.g. MSUBJ, MCOMP). We achieve near state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of phrase similarity tasks (Section 5.2) and relation classification (Section 5.3).\nFurthermore, we show that a vector as constructed above for “banned drugs” can be used as a query vector to retrieve a coarse-grained candi-\ndate list of banned drugs, by sorting its dot products with answer vectors that are also learned by our model (Figure 1d). This is due to the ability of our approach to provide a language model that can find likely words to fill in the blanks such as “ is a banned drug” or “the drug is banned by . . . ”. A highlight is the calculation being done as if a query is “executed” by the DCS tree of “banned drugs”. We quantitatively evaluate this utility on sentence completion task (Zweig et al., 2012) and report a new state-of-the-art (Section 5.4)."

      "heading" : "2 DCS Trees",
      "text" : "DCS composes meanings from denotations, or sets of things to which words apply. A “thing” (i.e. element of a denotation) is represented by a tuple of features of the form Field=Value, with a fixed inventory of fields. For example, a denotation ban might be a set of tuples ban = {(SUBJ=Canada,COMP=Thalidomide), . . .}, in which each tuple records participants of a banning event (e.g. Canada banning Thalidomide).\nOperations are applied to sets of things to generate new denotations, for modeling semantic composition. An example is the intersection of pet and fish giving the denotation of “pet fish”. Another necessary operation is projection; by πN we mean a function mapping a tuple to its value of the field N. For example, πCOMP(ban) is the value set of the COMP fields in ban, which consists of banned objects (i.e. {Thalidomide, . . .}). In this paper, we assume a field ARG to be names of things representing themselves, hence for example πARG(drug) is the set of names of drugs.\nFor a value set V , we also consider inverse image π−1N (V ) := {x | πN(x) ∈ V }. For example,\nD1 := π −1 SUBJ(πARG(man))\nconsists of all tuples of the form (SUBJ=x, . . .), where x is a man’s name (i.e. x ∈ πARG(man)). Thus, sell ∩ D1 denotes men’s selling events (i.e. {(SUBJ=John,COMP=Aspirin), . . .} as in Figure 2). Similarly, the denotation of “banned\ndrugs” as in Figure 1b is formally written as"

The DCS tree for the sentence “a man sells banned drugs” is shown in Figure 2. Formally, a DCS tree is defined as a rooted tree in which nodes are denotations of content words and edges are labeled by fields at each ends. Assume a node x has children y1, . . . ,yn, and the edges (x,y1), . . . , (x,yn) are labeled by (P1,L1), . . . , (Pn,Ln), respectively. Then, the denotation [[x]] of the subtree rooted at x is recursively calculated as\n[[x]] := x ∩ n⋂\ni=1\nπ−1Pi (πLi([[yi]])). (1)\nAs a result, the denotation of the DCS tree in Figure 2 is the denotation D3 of “a man sells banned drugs” as calculated above. DCS can be further extended to handle phenomena such as quantifiers or superlatives (Liang et al., 2013; Tian et al., 2014). In this paper, we focus on the basic version, but note that it is already expressive enough to at least partially capture the meanings of a large portion of phrases and sentences.\nDCS trees can be learned from question-answer pairs and a given database of denotations (Liang et al., 2013), or they can be extracted from dependency trees if no database is specified, by taking advantage of the observation that DCS trees are similar to dependency trees (Tian et al., 2014). We use the latter approach, obtaining DCS trees by rule-based conversion from universal dependency (UD) trees (McDonald et al., 2013). Therefore, nodes in a DCS tree are content words in a UD tree, which are in the form of lemma-POS pairs\n(Figure 3). The inventory of fields is designed to be ARG, SUBJ, COMP, and all prepositions. Prepositions are unlike content words which denote sets of things, but act as relations which we treat similarly as SUBJ and COMP. For example, a prepositional phrase attached to a verb (e.g. play on the grass) is treated as in Figure 3a. The presence of two field labels on each edge of a DCS tree makes it convenient for modeling semantics in several cases, such as a relative clause (Figure 3b)."

      "heading" : "3 Vector-based DCS",
      "text" : "For any content word w, we use a query vector vw to model its denotation, and an answer vector uw to model a prototypical element in that denotation. Query vector v and answer vector u are learned such that exp(v · u) is proportional to the probability of u answering the query v. The learning source is a collection of DCS trees, based on the idea that the DCS tree of a declarative sentence usually has non-empty denotation. For example, “kids play” means there exists some kid who plays. Consequently, some element in the play denotation belongs to π−1SUBJ(πARG(kid)), and some element in the kid denotation belongs to π−1ARG(πSUBJ(play)). This is a signal to increase the dot product of uplay and the query vector of π−1SUBJ(πARG(kid)), as well as the dot product of ukid and the query vector of π−1ARG(πSUBJ(play)). When optimized on a large corpus, the “typical” elements of play and kid should be learned by uplay and ukid, respectively. In general, one has\nTheorem 1 Assume the denotation of a DCS tree is not empty. Given any path from node x to y, assume edges along the path are labeled by (P, L), . . . , (K,N). Then, an element in the denotation y belongs to π−1N (πK(. . . (π −1 L (πP(x) . . .). Therefore, for any two nodes in a DCS tree, the path from one to another forms a training example, which signals increasing the dot product of the corresponding query and answer vectors.\nIt is noteworthy that the above formalization happens to be closely related to the skip-gram model (Mikolov et al., 2013b). The skip-gram learns a target vector vw and a context vector uw for each word w. It assumes the probability of a word y co-occurring with a word x in a context window is proportional to exp(vx · uy). Hence, if x and y co-occur within a context window, then one gets a signal to increase vx · uy. If the context window is taken as the same DCS tree, then\nthe learning of skip-gram and vector-based DCS will be almost the same, except that the target vector vx becomes the query vector v, which is no longer assigned to the word x but the path from x to y in the DCS tree (e.g. the query vector for π−1SUBJ(πARG(kid)) instead of vkid). Therefore, our model can also be regarded as extending skipgram to take account of the changes of meanings caused by different syntactic-semantic roles.\nAdditive Composition Word vectors trained by skip-gram are known to be semantically additive, such as exhibited in word analogy tasks. An effect of adding up two skip-gram vectors is further analyzed in Tian et al. (2015). Namely, the target vector vw can be regarded as encoding the distribution of context words surrounding w. If another word x is given, vw can be decomposed into two parts, one encodes context words shared with x, and another encodes context words not shared. When vw and vx are added up, the non-shared part of each of them tend to cancel out, because non-shared parts have nearly independent distributions. As a result, the shared part gets reinforced. An error bound is derived to estimate how close 12(vw + vx) gets to the distribution of the shared part. We can see the same mechanism exists in vector-based DCS. In a DCS tree, two paths share a context word if they lead to a same node y; semantically, this means some element in the denotation y belongs to both denotations of the two paths (e.g. given the sentence “kids play balls”, π−1SUBJ(πARG(kid)) and π−1COMP(πARG(ball)) both contain a playing event whose SUBJ is a kid and COMP is a ball). Therefore, addition of query vectors of two paths approximates their intersection because the shared context y gets reinforced.\nProjection Generally, for any two denotations X1,X2 and any projection πN, we have\nπN(X1 ∩ X2) ⊆ πN(X1) ∩ πN(X2). (2)\nAnd the “⊆” can often become “=”, for example when πN is a one-to-one map or X1 = π −1 N (V ) for some value set V . Therefore, if intersection is realized by addition, it will be natural to realize projection by linear mapping because\n(v1 + v2)MN = v1MN + v2MN (3)\nholds for any vectors v1,v2 and any matrix MN, which is parallel to (2). If πN is realized by a matrix MN, then π −1 N should correspond to the inverse matrix M−1N , because πN(π −1 N (V )) = V for\nany value set V . So we have realized all composition operations in DCS.\nQuery vector of a DCS tree Now, we can define the query vector of a DCS tree as parallel to (1):\nv[[x]] := vx + 1\nn n∑ i=1 v[[yi]]MLiM −1 Pi .

For any path from node x to y sampled from a DCS tree, assume the edges along are labeled by (P, L), . . . , (K,N). Then, the dot product vxMPM −1 L . . .MKM −1 N ·uy gets a signal to increase. Formally, we adopt the noise-contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyvärinen, 2012) as used in the skip-gram model, and mix the paths sampled from DCS trees with artificially generated noise. Then, σ(vxMPM −1 L . . .MKM −1 N ·uy) models the probability of a training example coming from DCS trees, where σ(θ) = 1/{1 + exp(−θ)} is the sigmoid function. The vectors and matrices are trained by maximizing the log-likelihood of the mixed data. We use stochastic gradient descent (Bottou, 2012) for training. Some important settings are discussed below.\nNoise For any vxM1M−12 . . .M2l−1M −1 2l · uy obtained from a path of a DCS tree, we generate noise by randomly choosing an index i ∈ [2, 2l], and then replacingMj orM−1j (∀j ≥ i) and uy by MN(j) or M −1 N(j) and uz, respectively, where N(j) and z are independently drawn from the marginal (i.e. unigram) distributions of fields and words.\nUpdate For each data point, when i is the chosen index above for generating noise, we view indices j < i as the ”target” part, and j >= i as the ”context”, which is completely replaced by the noise, as an analogous to the skip-gram model. Then, at each step we only update one vector and one matrix from each of the target, context, and noise part; more specifically, we only update vx, Mi−1 or M−1i−1, Mi or M −1 i , MN(i) or M −1 N(i), uy and uz, at the step. This is much faster than always updating all matrices.\nInitialization Matrices are initialized as 12(I + G), where I is the identity matrix; and G and all\nvectors are initialized with i.i.d. Gaussians of variance 1/d, where d is the vector dimension. We find that the diagonal component I is necessary to bring information from vx to uy, whereas the randomness of G makes convergence faster. M−1N is initialized as the transpose of MN.\nLearning Rate We find that the initial learning rate for vectors can be set to 0.1. But for matrices, it should be less than 0.0005 otherwise the model diverges. For stable training, we rescale gradients when their norms exceed a threshold.\nRegularizer During training, MN and M−1N are treated as independent matrices. However, we use the regularizer γ‖M−1N MN− 1 d tr(M −1 N MN)I‖\n2 to drive M−1N close to the inverse of MN.\n1 We also use κ‖M⊥N MN− 1 d tr(M ⊥ N MN)I‖\n2 to prevent MN from having too different scales at different directions (i.e., to drive MN close to orthogonal). We set γ = 0.001 and κ = 0.0001. Despite the rather weak regularizer, we find thatM−1N can be learned to be exactly the inverse of MN, and MN can actually be an orthogonal matrix, showing some semantic regularity (Section 5.1)."

The equation (5) is intended to degrade long paths which pass through several high-valency nodes. We use a random walk algorithm to sample paths such that the expected times a path is sampled equals its weight. As a result, the sampled path lengths range from 1 to 19, average 2.1, with an exponential tail. We convert all words which are sampled less than 1000 times to *UNKNOWN*/POS, and all prepositions occurring less than 10000 times to an *UNKNOWN* field. As a result, we obtain a vocabulary of 109k words and 211 field names.\nUsing the sampled paths, vectors and matrices are trained as in Section 4 (vecDCS). The vector dimension is set to d = 250. We compare with three baselines: (i) all matrices are fixed to identity (“no matrix”), in order to investigate the effects of meaning changes caused by syntactic-semantic roles and prepositions; (ii) the regularizer enforcingM−1N to be actually the inverse matrix ofMN is set to γ = 0 (“no inverse”), in order to investigate the effects of a semantically motivated constraint; and (iii) applying the same training scheme to UD trees directly, by modeling UD relations as matrices (“vecUD”). In this case, one edge is assigned one UD relation rel, so we implement the transfor-\nmation from child to parent byMrel, and from parent to child by M−1rel . The same hyper-parameters are used to train vecUD. By comparing vecDCS with vecUD we investigate if applying the semantics framework of DCS makes any difference. Additionally, we compare with the GloVe (6B, 300d) vector5 (Pennington et al., 2014). Norms of all word vectors are normalized to 1 and Frobenius norms of all matrices are normalized to √ d."

For these matrices, the corresponding M−1 also exactly converge to their inverse. It suggests regularities in the semantic space, especially because orthogonal matrices preserve cosine similarity – if MN is orthogonal, two words x, y and their projections πN(x), πN(y) will have the same similarity measure, which is semantically reasonable.

In these tasks, a system calculates similarity scores for pairs of phrases, and the performance is evaluated as its correlation with human annotators, measured by Spearman’s ρ.\nDatasets Mitchell and Lapata (2010) create datasets7 for pairs of three types of two-word phrases: adjective-nouns (AN) (e.g. “black hair” and “dark eye”), compound nouns (NN) (e.g. “tax charge” and “interest rate”) and verb-objects (VO) (e.g. “fight war” and “win battle”). Each dataset consists of 108 pairs and each pair is annotated by 18 humans (i.e., 1,944 scores in total). Similarity scores are integers ranging from 1 to 7. Another dataset8 is created by extending VO to SubjectVerb-Object (SVO), and then assessing similarities by crowd sourcing (Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh, 2014). The dataset GS11 created by Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh (2011) (100 pairs, 25 annotators) is also of the form SVO, but in each pair only the verbs are different (e.g. “man pro-\n7http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ s0453356/\n8http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/ compdistmeaning/\nvide/supply money”). The dataset GS12 described in Grefenstette (2013a) (194 pairs, 50 annotators) is of the form Adjective-Noun-Verb-AdjectiveNoun (e.g. “local family run/move small hotel”), where only verbs are different in each pair.\nOur method We calculate the cosine similarity of query vectors corresponding to phrases. For example, the query vector for “fight war” is calculated as vwarMARGM −1 COMP + vfight. For vecUD we use Mnsubj and Mdobj instead of MSUBJ and MCOMP, respectively. For GloVe we use additive compositions.\nResults As shown in Table 3, vecDCS is competitive on AN, NN, VO, SVO and GS12, consistently outperforming “no inverse”, vecUD and GloVe, showing strong compositionality. The weakness of “no inverse” suggests that relaxing the constraint of inverse matrices may hurt compositionaly, though our preliminary examination on word similarities did not find any difference. The GS11 dataset appears to favor models that can learn from interactions between the subject and object arguments, such as the non-linear model Waddnl in Hashimoto et al. (2014) and the entanglement model in Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh (2014). However, these models do not show particular advantages on other datasets. The recursive autoencoder (RAE) proposed in Socher et al. (2011) shares an aspect with vecDCS as to construct meanings from parse trees. It is tested by Blacoe and Lapata (2012) for compositionality, where vecDCS appears to be better. Neverthe-\nless, we note that “no matrix” performs as good as vecDCS, suggesting that meaning changes caused by syntactic-semantic roles might not be major factors in these datasets, because the syntacticsemantic relations are all fixed in each dataset."

In contrast, distributional semantics provides an elegant methodology for assessing semantic similarity and is well suited for learning from data. There have been repeated calls for combining the strength of these two approaches (Coecke et al., 2010; Baroni et al., 2014; Liang and Potts, 2015), and several systems (Lewis and Steedman, 2013; Beltagy et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014) have contributed to this direction. In the remarkable work by Beltagy et al. (to appear), word and phrase similarities are explicitly transformed to weighted logical rules that are used in a probabilistic inference framework. However, this approach requires considerable amount of engineering, including the generation of rule candidates (e.g. by aligning sentence fragments), converting distributional similarities to weights, and efficiently handling the rules and inference. What if the distributional representations are equipped with a logical interface, such that the inference can be realized by simple vector calculations? We have shown it possible to realize semantic composition; we believe this may lead to significant simplification of the system design for combining logic and distributional semantics.\nCompositional Distributional Models There has been active exploration on how to combine word vectors such that adequate phrase/sentence similarities can be assessed (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010, inter alia), and there is nothing new in using matrices to model changes of meanings. However, previous model designs mostly rely on linguistic intuitions (Paperno et al., 2014, inter alia), whereas our model has an exact logic interpretation. Furthermore, by using additive composition we enjoy a learning guarantee (Tian et al., 2015).\nVector-based Logic Models This work also shares the spirit with Grefenstette (2013b) and Rocktaeschel et al. (2014), in exploring vector calculations that realize logic operations. However, the previous works did not specify how to integrate contextual distributional information, which is necessary for calculating semantic similarity.\nFormal Semantics Our model implements a fragment of logic capable of semantic composition, largely due to the simple framework of Dependency-based Compositional Semantics\n(Liang et al., 2013). It fits in a long tradition of logic-based semantics (Montague, 1970; Dowty et al., 1981; Kamp and Reyle, 1993), with extensive studies on extracting semantics from syntactic representations such as HPSG (Copestake et al., 2001; Copestake et al., 2005) and CCG (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002; Bos et al., 2004; Steedman, 2012; Artzi et al., 2015; Mineshima et al., 2015).\nLogic for Natural Language Inference The pursue of a logic more suitable for natural language inference is also not new. For example, MacCartney and Manning (2008) has implemented a model of natural logic (Lakoff, 1970). We would not reach the current formalization of logic of DCS without reading the work by Calvanese et al. (1998), which is an elegant formalization of database semantics in description logic.\nSemantic Parsing DCS-related representations have been actively used in semantic parsing and we see potential in applying our model. For example, Berant and Liang (2014) convert λ-DCS queries to canonical utterances and assess paraphrases at the surface level; an alternative could be using vector-based DCS to bring distributional similarity directly into calculation of denotations. We also borrow ideas from previous work, for example our training scheme is similar to Guu et al. (2015) in using paths and composition of matrices, and our method is similar to Poon and Domingos (2009) in building structured knowledge from clustering syntactic parse of unlabeled data.\nFurther Applications Regarding the usability of distributional representations learned by our model, a strong point is that the representation takes into account syntactic/structural information of context. Unlike several previous models (Padó and Lapata, 2007; Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Pham et al., 2015), our approach learns matrices at the same time that can extract the information according to different syntactic-semantic roles. A related application is selectional preference (Baroni and Lenci, 2010; Lenci, 2011; Van de Cruys, 2014), wherein our model might has potential for smoothly handling composition.\nReproducibility Find our code at https:// github.com/tianran/vecdcs\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by CREST, JST.

We show theoretical evidence that the vector compositions in our model conform to the logic of DCS. Experimentally, we show that vector-based composition brings a strong ability to calculate similar phrases as similar vectors, achieving near state-of-the-art on a wide range of phrase similarity tasks and relation classification; meanwhile, DCS can guide building vectors for structured queries that can be directly executed. We evaluate this utility on sentence completion task and report a new state-of-the-art.",
