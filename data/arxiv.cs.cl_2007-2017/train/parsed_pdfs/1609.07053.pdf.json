      "text" : "A key issue in computational semantics is the transferability of semantic information across languages. Many semantic parsing systems depend on sources of information such as POS tags (Pradhan et al., 2004; Copestake et al., 2005; Bos, 2008; Butler, 2010; Berant and Liang, 2014). However, these tags are often customised for the language at hand (Marcus et al., 1993) or massively abstracted, such as the Universal Dependencies tagset (Nivre et al., 2016). Furthermore, POS tags are syntactically oriented, and therefore often contain both irrelevant and insufficient information for semantic analysis and deeper semantic processing. This means that, although POS tags are highly useful for many downstream tasks, they are unsuitable both for semantic parsing in general, and for tasks such as recognising textual entailment.\nWe present a novel set of semantic labels tailored for the purpose of multilingual semantic parsing. This tagset (i) abstracts over POS and named entity types; (ii) fills gaps in semantic modelling by adding new categories (for instance for phenomena like negation, modality, and quantification); and (iii) generalises over specific languages (see Section 2). We introduce and motivate this new task in this paper, and refer to it as semantic tagging. Our experiments aim to answer the following two research questions:\n1. Given an annotated corpus of semantic tags, it is straightforward to apply off-the-shelf sequence taggers. Can we significantly outperform these with recent neural network architectures?\n2. Semantic tagging is essential for deep semantic parsing. Can we find evidence that semtags are effective also for other NLP tasks?\nTo address the first question, we will look at convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are both highly prominent approaches in recent natural language processing (NLP) literature. A recent development is the emergence of deep residual networks (ResNets), a building block for CNNs. ResNets consist of several stacked residual units, which can be thought of as a collection of convolutional layers coupled with a ‘shortcut’ which aids the propagation of the signal in a neural network. This allows for the construction of much deeper networks, since keeping a ‘clean’ information path in the network facilitates optimisation (He et al., 2016). ResNets have recently shown state-of-the-art performance for image classification tasks (He et al., 2015; He et al., 2016), and have\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

However, no previous work has attempted to apply ResNets to NLP tagging tasks.\nTo answer our second question, we carry out an extrinsic evaluation exercise. We investigate the effect of using semantic tags as an auxiliary loss for POS tagging. Since POS tags are useful for many NLP tasks, it follows that semantic tags must be useful if they can improve POS tagging."

      "text" : "We refer to semantic tagging, or semtagging, as the task of assigning semantic class categories to the smallest meaningful units in a sentence. In the context of this paper these units can be morphemes, words, or multi-word expressions. The linguistic information traditionally obtained for deep processing is insufficient for fine-grained lexical semantic analysis. The widely used Penn Treebank (PTB) Partof-Speech tagset (Marcus et al., 1993) does not make the necessary semantic distinctions, in addition to containing redundant information for semantic processing. Let us consider a couple of examples.\nThere are significant differences in meaning between the determiners every (universal quantification), no (negation), and some (existential quantification), but they all receive the DT (determiner) POS label in PTB. Since determiners form a closed class, one could enumerate all word forms for each class. Indeed some recent implementations of semantic parsing follow this strategy (Bos, 2008; Butler, 2010). This might work for a single language, but it falls short when considering a multilingual setting. Furthermore, determiners like any can have several interpretations and need to be disambiguated in context.\nSemantic tagging does not only apply to determiners, but reaches all parts of speech. Other examples where semantic classes disambiguate are reflexive versus emphasising pronouns (both POS tagged as PRP, personal pronoun); the comma, that could be a conjunction, disjunction, or apposition; intersective vs. subsective and privative adjectives (all POS tagged as JJ, adjective); proximal vs. medial and distal demonstratives (see Example 1); subordinate vs. coordinate discourse relations; agent nouns vs. entity nouns. The set of semantic tags that we use in this paper is established in a data-driven manner, considering four languages in a parallel corpus (English, German, Dutch and Italian). This first inventory of classes comprises 13 coarse-grained tags and 66 fine-grained tags (see Table 1). As can be seen from this table and the examples given below, the tagset also includes named entity classes (see also Example 2).\n(1) These PRX cats CON live ENS in REL that DST house CON . NIL\n(2) Ukraine GPE ’s HAS glory CON has ENT not NOT yet IST perished EXT , NIL neither NOT her HAS freedom CON . NIL\nIn Example 1, both these and that would be tagged as DT. However, with our semantic tagset, they are disambiguated as PRX (proximal) and DST (distal). In Example 2, Ukraine is tagged as GPE rather than NNP."

The Groningen Meaning Bank (GMB) corpus of English texts (1.4 million words) containing silver standard semantic tags obtained by running a simple rule-based semantic tagger (Bos et al., Forthcoming). This tagger uses POS and named entity tags available in the GMB (automatically obtained with the C&C tools (Curran et al., 2007) and then manually corrected), as well as a set of manually crafted rules to output semantic tags. Some tags related to specific phenomena were hand-corrected in a second stage.\nOur second dataset is smaller but equipped with gold standard semantic tags and used for testing (PMB, the Parallel Meaning Bank). It comprises a selection of 400 sentences of the English part of a parallel corpus. It has no overlap with the GMB corpus. For this dataset, we used the Elephant tokeniser, which performs word, multi-word and sentence segmentation (Evang et al., 2013). We then used the simple rule-based semantic tagger described above to get an initial set of tags. These tags were then corrected by a human annotator (one of the authors of this paper).\nFor the extrinsic evaluation, we use the English portion of the Universal Dependencies dataset, version 1.2 and 1.3 (Nivre et al., 2016). An overview of the data used is shown in Table 2."

      "text" : "GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) are a recently introduced variant of RNNs, and are designed to prevent vanishing gradients, thus being able to cope with longer input sequences than vanilla RNNs. GRUs are similar to the more commonly-used Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), both in purpose and implementation (Chung et al., 2014). A bi-directional GRU is a GRU which makes both forward and backward passes over sequences, and can therefore use both preceding and succeeding contexts to predict a tag (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005; Goldberg, 2015). Bi-directional GRUs and LSTMs have been shown to yield high performance on several NLP tasks, such as POS tagging, named entity tagging, and chunking (Wang et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016; Plank et al., 2016). We build on previous approaches by combining bi-GRUs with character representations from a basic CNN and ResNets."

      "heading" : "3.2 Deep Residual Networks",
      "text" : "Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) are built up by stacking residual units. A residual unit can be expressed as:\nyl = h(xl) + F(xl,Wl), xl+1 = f(yl),\n(3)\nwhere xl and xl+1 are the input and output of the l-th layer,Wl is the weights for the l-th layer, and F is a residual function (He et al., 2016), e.g., the identity function (He et al., 2015), which we also use in our experiments. ResNets can be intuitively understood by thinking of residual functions as paths through which information can propagate easily. This means that, in every layer, a ResNet learns more complex feature combinations, which it combines with the shallower representation from the previous layer. This architecture allows for the construction of much deeper networks. ResNets have recently been found to yield impressive performance in image recognition tasks, with networks as deep as 1001 layers (He et al., 2015; He et al., 2016), and are thus an interesting and effective alternative to simply stacking layers. In this paper we use the assymetric variant of ResNets as described in Equation 9 in He et al. (2016):\nxl+1 = xl + F(f̂(xl),Wl). (4)\nResNets have been very recently applied in NLP to morphological reinflection (Östling, 2016) and tasks such as sentiment analysis and text categorisation (Conneau et al., 2016). Our work is the first to apply ResNets to NLP sequence tagging tasks. We further contribute to the literature on ResNets by introducing a residual bypass function. The intuition is to combine both deep and shallow processing, which opens a path of easy signal propagation between lower and higher layers in the network."

      "heading" : "3.3 Modelling character information and residual bypass",
      "text" : "Using sub-token representations instead of, or in combination with, word-level representations has recently obtained a lot of attention due to their effectiveness (Sutskever et al., 2011; Chrupała, 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Chung et al., 2016; Gillick et al., 2015). The use of sub-token representations can be approached in several ways. Plank et al. (2016) and Yang et al. (2016) use a hierarchical bidirectional RNN, first passing over characters in order to create word-level representations. Gillick et al. (2015) similarly apply an LSTM-based model using byte-level information directly. Dos Santos and Zadrozny (2014) construct character-based word-level representations by running a convolutional network over the character representations of each word. All of these approaches have in common that the character-based representation is passed through the entire remainder of the network. Our work is the\nfirst to combine the use of character-level representations with both deep processing (i.e., passing this representation through the network) and shallow processing (i.e., bypassing the network in our residual bypass function). We achieve this by applying our novel residual bypass function to our character representations, inspired by the success of ResNets. In particular, we first apply the bypass to a CNN-based model achieving large gains over a plain CNN, and later evaluate its effectiveness in a ResNet.\nA core intuition behind CNNs is the processing of an input signal in a hierarchical manner (LeCun et al., 1998; Goodfellow et al., 2016). Taking, e.g., a 3-dimensional image (width× height× depth), the approach is typically to reduce spatial dimensions of the image while increasing depth. This hierarchical processing allows a CNN to learn high-level features of an input, essential to image recognition tasks. A drawback of this method, however, is that lower-level features are potentially lost in the abstraction to higher-level features. This issue is partially countered by ResNets, as information is allowed to flow more easily between residual blocks. However, this approach does not allow for simple and direct use of information in the network input in final layers. To alleviate this issue, we present a residual bypass function, which can be seen as a global residual function (depicted in Figure 1). This function allows both lower-level and higher-level features to be taken directly into account in the final layers of the network. The intuition behind using such a global residual function in NLP is that character information primarily ought to be of importance for the prediction of the current word. Hence, allowing these representations to bypass our bi-GRU might be beneficial. This residual bypass function is not dependent on the usage of ResNets, and can be combined with other NN architectures as in our experiments. We define the penultimate layer of a network with n layers, using a residual bypass, as follows:\nyn−1 = h(xn−1) + F(xi,Wi), (5)\nwhere xi and Wi are the input and weights of the ith layer, F is a residual function (in our case the identity function), and h(xn−1) is the output of the penultimate layer. In our experiments, we apply a residual bypass function to our convolutional character representations."

      "heading" : "3.4 System description",
      "text" : "The core of our architecture consists of a bi-GRU taking an input based on words and/or characters, with an optional residual bypass as defined in subsection 3.3. We experiment with a basic CNN, ResNets and our novel residual bypass function. We also implemented a variant of the Inception model (Szegedy et al., 2015), but found this to be outperformed by ResNets. Our system is implemented in Keras using the Tensorflow backend (Chollet, 2015; Abadi et al., 2016), and the code is available at https://github.com/bjerva/semtagger.\nWe represent each sentence using both a character-based representation (Sc) and a word-based representation (Sw). The character-based representation is a 3-dimensional matrix Sc ∈ Rs×w×dc , where s is the zero-padded sentence length, w is the zero-padded word length, and dc is the dimensionality of the character embeddings. The word-based representation is a 2-dimensional matrix Sw ∈ Rs×dw , where s is the zero-padded sentence length and dw is the dimensionality of the word embeddings. We use the English Polyglot embeddings (Al-Rfou et al., 2013) in order to initialise the word embedding layer, but also experiment with randomly initialised word embeddings.\nWord embeddings are passed directly into a two-layer bi-GRU (Chung et al., 2014). We also experimented using a bi-LSTM. However, we found GRUs to yield comparatively better validation data performance on semtags. We also observe better validation data performance when running two consecutive forward and backward passes before concatenating the GRU layers, rather than concatenating after each forward/backward pass as is commonplace in NLP literature.\nWe use CNNs for character-level modelling. Our basic CNN is inspired by dos Santos and Zadrozny (2014), who use character-representations to produce local features around each character of a word, and combine these with a maximum pooling operation in order to create fixed-size character-level word embeddings. The convolutions used in this manner cover a few neighbouring letters at a time, as well as the entire character vector dimension (dc). In contrast to dos Santos and Zadrozny (2014), we treat a word analogously to an image. That is to say, we see a word of n characters embedded in a space\nwith dimensionality dc as an image of dimensionality n × dc. This view gives us additional freedom in terms of sizes of convolutional patches used, which offers more computational flexibility than using only, e.g., 4× dc convolutions. This view is applied to all CNN variations explored in this work.\nA neural network is trained with respect to some loss function, such as the cross-entropy between the predicted tag probability distribution and the gold probability distribution. Recent work has shown that the addition of an auxiliary loss function can be beneficial to several tasks. Cheng et al. (2015) use a language modelling task as an auxiliary loss, as they attempt to predict the next token while performing named entity recognition. Plank et al. (2016) use the log frequency of the current token as an auxiliary loss function, and find this to improve POS tagging accuracy. Since our semantic tagging task is based on predicting fine semtags, which can be mapped to coarse semtags, we add the prediction of these coarse semtags as an auxiliary loss for the semtagging experiments. Similarly, we also experiment with POS tagging, where we use the fine semtags as an auxiliary information."

      "text" : "All hyperparameters are tuned with respect to loss on the semtag validation set. We use rectified linear units (ReLUs) for all activation functions (Nair and Hinton, 2010), and apply dropout with p = 0.1 to both input weights and recurrent weights in the bi-GRU (Srivastava et al., 2014). In the CNNs, we apply batch normalisation (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015) followed by dropout with p = 0.5 after each layer. In our basic CNN, we apply a 4× 8 convolution, followed by 2× 2 maximum pooling, followed by 4× 4 convolution and another 2 × 2 maximum pooling. Our ResNet has the same setup, with the addition of a residual connection. We also experimented with using average pooling instead of maximum pooling, but this yielded lower validation data performance on the semantic tagging task. We set both dc and dw to 64. All GRU layers have 100 hidden units. All experiments were run with early stopping monitoring validation set loss, using a maximum of 50 epochs. We use a batch size of 500. Optimisation is done using the ADAM algorithm (Kingma and Ba, 2014), with the categorical cross-entropy loss function as training objective. The main and auxiliary loss functions have a weighting parameter, λ. In our experiments, we weight the auxiliary loss with λ = 0.1, as set on the semtag auxiliary task.\nMulti-word expressions (MWEs) are especially prominent in the semtag data, where they are annotated as single tokens. Pre-trained word embeddings are unlikely to include entries such as ‘International Organization for Migration’, so we apply a simple heuristic in order to avoid treating most MWEs as unknown words. In particular, the representation of a MWE is set to the sum of the individual embeddings of each constituent word."

This model is trained on the concatenation of the ST silver data with the UD data, updating the loss of the respective task of an instance in each iteration.

On the ST silver data, a significant difference (p < 0.01) is found when comparing our best system to the strongest baseline (BI-LSTM). On the ST gold data, we observe significant differences at the alpha values recommended by Søgaard et al. (2014), with p < 0.0025. The residual bypass effectively helps improve the performance of the basic CNN. However, the tagging accuracy of the CNN falls below baselines. In addition, the large gap between gold and silver data for the CNN shows that the CNN model is more prone to overfitting, thus favouring the use of the ResNet. Adding the coarse-grained semtags as auxiliary task only helps for\nthe weaker CNN model. The ResNet does not benefit from this additional information, which is already captured in the fine-grained labels.\nIt is especially noteworthy that the ResNet character-only system performs remarkably well, as it outperforms the BI-GRU and TNT baselines, and is considerably better than the basic CNN. Since performance increases further when adding in ~w, it is clear that the character and word representations are complimentary in nature. The high results for characters only are particularly promising for multilingual language processing, a direction we want to explore next."

In this setting, our tagger outperforms the BI-LSTM system, and results in new state-of-the-art results on both UD 1.2 (95.71% accuracy) and 1.3 (95.67% accuracy). The difference between the BI-LSTM system and our best system is significant at p < 0.0025.\nThe fact that the semantic tags improve POS tagging performance reflects two properties of semantic tags. Firstly, it indicates that the semantic tags carry important information for the prediction of POS tags. This should come as no surprise, considering the fact that the semtags abstract over and carry more information than POS tags. Secondly, it indicates that the new semantic tagset and released dataset are useful for downstream NLP tasks. In this paper we show this by using semtags as an auxiliary loss.
