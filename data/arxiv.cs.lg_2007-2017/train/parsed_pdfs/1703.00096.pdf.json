      "text" : "In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in sequence labelling tasks. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss (Graves et al., 2006) and Sequenceto-sequence (seq2seq) models (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014) present powerful approaches to multiple applications, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nBaidu Silicon Valley AI Lab Tech Report ∗Equal contribution.\n(Chan et al., 2016a; Hannun et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2016), machine translation (Sébastien et al., 2015), and parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015). These methods are based on 1) a fixed and carefully chosen set of basic units, such as words (Sutskever et al., 2014), phonemes (Chorowski et al., 2015) or characters (Chan et al., 2016a), and 2) a fixed and pre-determined decomposition of target sequences into these basic units. While these two preconditions greatly simplify the problems, especially the training processes, they are also strict and unnecessary constraints, which usually lead to suboptimal solutions. CTC models are especially harmed by fixed basic units in target space, because they build on the independence assumption between successive outputs in that space - an assumption which is often violated in practice.\nThe problem with fixed set of basic units is obvious: it is really hard, if not impossible, to determine the optimal set of basic units beforehand. For example, in English ASR, if we use words as basic units, we will need to deal with the large vocabulary-sized softmax, as well as rare words and data sparsity problem. On the other hand, if we use characters as basic units, the model is forced to learn the complex rules of English spelling and pronunciation. For example, the \"oh\" sound can be spelled in any of following ways, depending on the word it occurs in - { o, oa, oe, ow, ough, eau, oo, ew }. While CTC can easily model commonly co-occuring grams together, it is impossible to give roughly equal probability to many possible spellings when transcribing unseen words. Most speech recognition systems model phonemes, sub-phoneme units and senones e.g, (Xiong et al., 2016a) to get around these problems. Similarly, state-of-the-art neural machine translation systems use pre-segmented word pieces e.g, (Wu et al., 2016a) aiming to find the best of both worlds.\nIn reality, groups of characters are typically cohesive units for many tasks. For the ASR task, words can be decomposed into groups of characters that can be associated with sound (such as ‘tion’ and ‘eaux’). For the machine translation task, there may be values in decomposing words as\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 09\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nM ar\n2 01\nroot words and extensions (so that meaning may be shared explicitly between ‘paternal’ and ‘paternity’). Since this information is already available in the training data, it is perhaps, better to let the model figure it out by itself. At the same time, it raises another import question: how to decompose a target sequence into basic units? This is coupled with the problem of automatic selection of basic units, thus also better to let the model determine. Recently, there are some interesting attempts in these directions in the seq2seq framework. For example, Chan et al (Chan et al., 2016b) proposed the Latent Sequence Decomposition to decompose target sequences with variable length units as a function of both input sequence and the output sequence.\nIn this work, we propose Gram-CTC - a strictly more general version of CTC - to automatically seek the best set of basic units from the training data, called grams, and automatically decompose target sequences into sequences of grams. Just as sequence prediction with cross entropy training can be seen as special case of the CTC loss with a fixed alignment, CTC can be seen as a special case of Gram-CTC with a fixed decomposition of target sequences. Since it is a loss function, it can be applied to many seq2seq tasks to enable automatic selection of grams and decomposition of target sequences without modifying the underlying networks. Extensive experiments on multiple scales of data validate that Gram-CTC can improve CTC in terms of both performance and efficiency, and that using Gram-CTC the models outperform state-of-the-arts on standard speech benchmarks."

      "text" : "The basic text units that previous works utilized for text prediction tasks (e.g,, automatic speech recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation and image captioning) can be generally divided into two categories: handcrafted ones and learning-based ones.\nHand-crafted Basic Units. Fixed sets of characters (graphemes) (Graves et al., 2006; Amodei et al., 2015), word-pieces (Wu et al., 2016b; Collobert et al., 2016; Zweig et al., 2016a), words (Soltau et al., 2016; Sébastien et al., 2015), and phonemes (Lee and Hon, 1988; Sercu and Goel, 2016; Xiong et al., 2016b) have been widely used as basic units for text prediction, but all of them have drawbacks.\n• Word-segmented models remove the component of learning to spell and thus enable direct optimization towards reducing Word Error Rate (WER). However, these models suffer from having to handle a large vocabulary (1.7 million in (Soltau et al., 2016)), out-ofvocabulary words (Soltau et al., 2016; Sébastien et al., 2015) and data sparsity problems (Soltau et al., 2016).\n• Using characters results in much smaller vocabularies (e.g, 26 for English and thousands for Chinese),\nbut it requires much longer contexts compared to using words or word-pieces and poses the challenge of composing characters to words (Graves et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2015), which is very noisy for languages like English.\n• Word-pieces lie at the middle-ground of words and characters, providing a good trade-off between vocabulary size and context size, while the performance of using word pieces is sensitive to the choice of the word-piece set and its decomposition.\n• For the ASR task, the use of phonemes was popular in the past few decades as it eases acoustic modeling (Lee and Hon, 1988) and good results were reported with phonemic models (Xiong et al., 2016b; Sercu and Goel, 2016). However, it introduces the uncertainties of mapping phonemes to words during decoding (Doss et al., 2003), which becomes less robust especially for accented speech data.\nUsing these aforementioned fixed deterministic decompositions of text sequences defines a prior, which is not necessarily optimal for end-to-end learning.\nLearning-based Basic Units. More recently, attempts have been made to learn basic unit sets along with the selection and decomposition of them automatically. (Chung et al., 2016) leveraged a multiscale RNN architecture to model the characters and words hierarchically, by building word-level representations on top of character-level representations. (Luong and Manning, 2016) proposed a hybrid Word-Character model what translates mostly at the word level and consults the character components for rare words. Chan et al (Chan et al., 2016b) proposed the Latent Sequence Decompositions framework to decomposes target sequences with variable length-ed basic units as a function of both input sequence and the output sequence."

      "text" : "Let G be a set of n-grams of the set of basic units C of the target sequence, and τ be the length of the longest gram in G. A Gram-CTC network has a softmax output layer with |G| + 1 units, that is, the probability over all grams in G and one additional symbol, blank.\nTo simplify the problem, we also assume C ⊆ G. This is because there may be no valid decompositions for some target sequences if C 6⊆ G. Since Gram-CTC will figure out the ideal decomposition of target sequences into grams during training, this condition is harmless, and only guaran-\ntees that there is at least one valid decomposition for every target sequence.\nFor an input sequence x of length T , let y = Nw(x) be the sequence of network outputs, and denote by ytk as the probability of the k-th gram at time t, where k is the index of grams in G′ = G ∪ {blank}, then we have\np(π|x) = T∏ t=1 ytπt ,∀π ∈ G ′T (1)\nJust as in the case of CTC, here we refer to the elements of G′\nT as paths, and denote them by π. The difference is that for each word in the target sequence, it may be decomposed into different sequences of grams. For example, the word hello can only be decomposed into the sequence [‘h’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’] for CTC (assume uni-gram CTC here), but it also can be decomposed into the sequence [‘he’, ‘ll’, ‘o’] if ’he’ and ’ll’ are in G.\nFor each π, we map it into a target sequence the same way as CTC using the collapsing function that 1) removes all repeated labels from the path and then 2) removes all blanks. Note that essentially it is these rules which determine the transitions between the states of adjacent time steps in Figure 1. This is a many-to-one mapping and we denote it by B. Thus, for a target sequence l, B−1(l) represents all paths mapped to l. Then, we have\np(l|x) = ∑\nπ∈B−1(l)\np(π|x) (2)\nThis equation allows us train sequence labeling models without any alignment information using CTC loss, be-\ncause it marginalizes over all possible alignments during training. However, in order to maximize the p(l|x), the model learns to concentrate all the probability mass on one path, such that Equation 2 may be approximated as\np(l|x) ≈ max π∈B−1(l) p(π|x) (3)\nThis selection of a single path, enables easy approximate decoding of CTC trained models. Gram-CTC uses the same effect to enable the model to select the most likely path, which defines in this case, not only an alignment, but also a decomposition of the target sequence.\nNote that for each target sequence l, the set B−1(l) has O(τ2) more paths than it does in vanilla CTC. This is because there are O(τ) times more valid states per time step, and each state may have a valid transition from O(τ) states in the previous time step. The original CTC method is thus, a special case of Gram-CTC when G = C and τ = 1. While the quadratic increase in the complexity of the algorithm is non trivial, we assert that it is a trivial increase in the overall training time of typical neural networks, where the computation time is dominated by the neural networks themselves. Additionally, the algorithm extends generally to any arbitrary G and need not have all possible n-grams up to length τ ."

      "text" : "To efficiently compute p(l|x), we also adopt the dynamic programming algorithm. The essence of all dynamic programming is in identifying the states of the problem, so that we may solve future states by reusing solutions to earlier\nstates. In our case, the state must contain all the information required to identify all valid extensions of an incomplete path π such that the collapsing function will eventually collapse the complete π back to l. For Gram-CTC, this can be done by collapsing all but the last element of the path π. Therefore, the state is a tuple (l1:i, j), where the first item is a collapsed path, representing a prefix of the target label sequence, and j ∈ {0, . . . , τ} is the length of the last gram (li−j+1:i) used for making the prefix. j = 0 is valid and means that blank was used. We denote the gram li−j+1:i by g j i (l), and the state (l1:i, j) as s j i (l). For readability, we will further shorten sji (l) to s j i and g j i (l) to gji . For a state s, the positions of its first character and last character in l are denoted by b(s) and e(s), respectively.\nFigure 1 illustrates partially the dynamic programming process for the target sequence ‘CAT’. Here we suppose G contains all possible uni-grams and bi-grams. Thus, for each character in ‘CAT’, there are three possible states associated with it: 1) the current character, 2) the bi-gram ending in current character, and 3) the blank after current character. There is also one blank at beginning.

However, it is unnecessary to consider many grams, such as ‘aaaa’, which are obviously useless.\nIn our experiments, we first eliminate most of useless grams from the statistics of a huge corpus, that is, we count the frequency of each gram in the corpus and drop these grams with rare frequencies. Then, we train a model with Gram-CTC on all the remaining grams. By applying (decoding) the trained model on a large speech dataset, we get the real statistics of gram’s usage. Ultimately, we choose high frequency grams together with all uni-grams as our final gram set G. Table 1 shows the impact of iterative gram selection on WSJ (without LM).

However, because it is small, we cannot use large grams here due to data sparsity problem. Thus, the auto-refined gram set on WSJ is not optimal for other larger datasets, where larger grams could be effectively used, but\nthe procedure of refinement is the same for them.\nWe first train a model using all uni-grams and bi-grams (29 uni-grams and 262 = 676 bi-grams, in total 705 grams), and then do decoding with the obtained model on another speech dataset to get the statistics of the usage of grams.

For comparison, we also present the result of the best handpicked grams, as well as the results on uni-grams. All the results are shown in Table 1.\nSome interesting observations can be found in Table 1. First, the performance of auto-refined grams is only slightly better than the combination of all uni-grams and all bigrams. This is probably because WSJ is so small that gram learning suffers from the data sparsity problem here (similar to word-segmented models). The auto-refined gram set contains only a small subset of bi-grams, thus more robust. This is also why we only try bi-grams, not including higher-order grams. Second, the performance of best handpicked grams is worse than auto-refined grams. This is desirable. It is time-consuming to handpick grams, especially when you consider high-order grams. The method of iterative gram selection is not only fast, but usually better. Third, the performance of Gram-CTC on auto-refined grams is only slightly better than CTC on uni-grams.

      "text" : "Using a large time stride for sequence labelling with RNNs can greatly boost the overall computation efficiency, since it effectively reduces the time steps for recurrent computation, thus speeds up the process of both forward inference and backward propagation. However, the largest stride that can be used is limited by the gram set we use. The (unigram) CTC has to work in a high time resolution (small stride) in order to have enough number of frames to output every character. This is very inefficient as we know the same acoustic feature could correspond to several grams of different lengths (e.g., {’i’, ’igh’, ’eye’}) . The larger the grams are, the larger stride we are potentially able to use.\nDS2 (Amodei et al., 2015) employed non-overlapping bigram outputs to allow for a larger stride. This imposes an\nartificial constraint forcing the model to learn, not only the spelling of each word, but also how to split words into bigrams. For example, part is split as [pa, rt] but the word apart is forced to be decomposed as [ap, ar, t]. GramCTC removes this constraint by allowing the model to decompose words into larger units into the most convenient or sensible decomposition. Comparison results show this change enables Gram-CTC to work much better than bigram CTC, as in Table 2.\nIn Table 2, we compare the performance of trained model and training efficiency on two strides, 2 and 4. For GramCTC, we use the auto-refined gram set from previous section. As expected, using stride 4 almost cuts the training time per epoch into half, compared to stride 2. From stride 2 to stride 4, the performance of uni-gram CTC drops quickly. This is because small grams inherently need higher time resolutions. As for Gram-CTC, from stride 2 to stride 4, its performance decreases a little bit, while in experiments on the other datasets, Gram-CTC constantly works better in stride 4. One possible explanation is that WSJ is too small for Gram-CTC to learn large grams well. In contrast, the performance of bi-gram CTC is not as good as that of Gram-CTC in either stride."

Here GramCTC uses stride 4 while CTC uses stride 2.\nFrom Figure 3, we can find that: 1) Gram-CTC does automatically find many intuitive and meaningful grams, such as ‘the’, ‘ng’, and ‘are’. 2) It also decomposes the sentences into segments which are meaningful in term of pronunciation. This decomposition resembles the phonetic decomposition, but in larger granularity and arguably more natural. 3) Since Gram-CTC predicts a chunk of characters (a gram) each time, each prediction utilizes larger context and these characters in the same predicted chunk are dependent, thus potentially more robust. One example is the word ‘will’ in the last sentence in Figure 3. 4) Since the output of network is the probability over all grams, the decoding process is almost the same as CTC, still end-toend. This makes such decomposition superior to phonetic decomposition. In summary, Gram-CTC combines the advantages of both CTC on characters and CTC on phonemes."

Our extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed Gram-CTC enables the models to run more efficiently than the vanilla CTC, by using larger stride, while obtaining better performance of sequence labelling. Comparison experiments on multiplescale datasets show the proposed Gram-CTC obtains stateof-the-art results on various ASR tasks. We will continue investigating techniques of improving the optimization of Gram-CTC loss, as well as the applications of Gram-CTC on other sequence labelling tasks."

    "abstractText" : "Most existing sequence labelling models rely on a fixed decomposition of a target sequence into a sequence of basic units. These methods suffer from two major drawbacks: 1) the set of basic units is fixed, such as the set of words, characters or phonemes in speech recognition, and 2) the decomposition of target sequences is fixed. These drawbacks usually result in sub-optimal performance of modeling sequences. In this paper, we extend the popular CTC loss criterion to alleviate these limitations, and propose a new loss function called Gram-CTC. While preserving the advantages of CTC, Gram-CTC automatically learns the best set of basic units (grams), as well as the most suitable decomposition of target sequences. Unlike CTC, Gram-CTC allows the model to output variable number of characters at each time step, which enables the model to capture longer term dependency and improves the computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed Gram-CTC improves CTC in terms of both performance and efficiency on the large vocabulary speech recognition task at multiple scales of data, and that with Gram-CTC we can outperform the state-of-the-art on a standard speech benchmark.",
