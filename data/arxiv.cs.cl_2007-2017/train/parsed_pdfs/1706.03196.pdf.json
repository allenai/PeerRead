      "text" : "1 Online Learning for Neural Machine Translation Post-editing\nNeural machine translation has meant a revolution of the field. Nevertheless, postediting the outputs of the system is mandatory for tasks requiring high translation quality. Post-editing offers a unique opportunity for improving neural machine translation systems, using online learning techniques and treating the post-edited translations as new, fresh training data. We review classical learning methods and propose a new optimization algorithm. We thoroughly compare online learning algorithms in a post-editing scenario. Results show significant improvements in translation quality and effort reduction."

      "text" : "In recent years, the statistical machine translation (SMT) field has evolved by leaps and bounds. Nevertheless, SMT systems still require human supervision in order to produce high-quality translations. This correction process is known as postediting. In the machine translation (MT) industry, the reduction of the post-editing effort has a great interest, as it leads to larger productivity (Arenas, 2008; Plitt and Masselot, 2010).\nThe text obtained during the post-editing process can be converted into new training data, useful for adapting the system to a different domain or to a changing environment.\nOnline learning (OL) techniques allow the system to learn from post-edited samples and, aiming to avoid the committed mistakes.\nThe application of OL to the classical phrasebased SMT systems has been thoroughly studied (Ortiz-Martı́nez, 2016). Nevertheless, over the last years, the new neural machine translation\n(NMT) technology has shaken the machine translation field (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016). Therefore, there is a need to reduce the post-editing effort in NMT systems.\nThe neural approach to MT has a short but meteoric history. The first fully neural translation system was introduced by Kalchbrenner and Blunsom (2013), being the first competitive NMT systems simultaneously developed by Cho et al. (2014) and Sutskever et al. (2014). From there to now, NMT has surpassed the classical phrase-based systems in many tasks and currently is one the most active research topics (e.g. Erk and Smith (2016)). Furthermore, the translation industry is also shifting to this new translation paradigm (Crego et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).\nNMT relies on the encoder-decoder framework. An encoder recurrent neural network (RNN) processes the source sentence, computing a dense, continuous representation of it. From this representation, a decoder RNN generates, word by word, the translated sentence. In order to cope with the vanishing gradient problem (Bengio et al., 1994), such RNNs feature gated units, such as long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) or gated recurrent units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014).\nThe vanilla encoder-decoder model has been steadily improved. The inclusion of attention mechanisms (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a) overcame the problem of processing long source sentences. The management of out-ofvocabulary words has also been explored (Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015b). Closely related to this, the NMT vocabulary size limitation has been tackled either developing strategies for taking into account large vocabularies (Jean et al., 2015) or shifting from word-level translations to character (Chung et al., 2016) or sub-word-level (Sennrich et al., 2016) translations.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 19\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n0 Ju\nn 20\n17\n2 Such NMT systems are usually trained from parallel corpora by means of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (Robbins and Monro, 1951). SGD can be applied sample by sample, fitting into the OL paradigm. In this paper, we evaluate the most common SGD optimizers. Moreover, we propose a new SGD variant for NMT, based on passive-aggressive (PA) techniques (Crammer et al., 2006). This method aims to apply the minimum modification to the model (passiveness) required to satisfy a correctness criterion (aggressiveness). The contributions of this work are the following: • We study the application of OL to the NMT framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies OL to NMT in a post-editing scenario. • We present a new OL algorithm, inspired by PA techniques and implemented using subgradient methods. • We conduct a wide experimentation, testing the NMT engine in three different scenarios. We compare well-established learning algorithms together with the newly proposed PA algorithms. • Results show that OL algorithms are able to significantly reduced the post-editing effort required by an NMT system. Moreover, we demonstrate the capability of NMT for adapting to different domains by means of OL techniques. • In order to make research reproducible, we make public the source code of the NMT system and the training algorithms1. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: after this introduction, Section 2 reviews the related work. An NMT system is briefly described in Section 3. The classical SGD methods are revisited in Section 4. Section 5 details the newly proposed online algorithm. Section 6 presents the experimental framework designed to assess our method. Results are shown and discussed in Section 7. Finally, we conclude in Section 8, tracing future research lines."

      "text" : "Online learning is a profusely studied topic in machine learning. In the field of SMT, OL techniques 1https://github.com/lvapeab/nmt-keras/ tree/interactive_NMT are mainly employed for tuning the weights of the log-linear model (Zens et al., 2002; Och and Ney, 2002) from classical phrase-based SMT systems (Koehn, 2010). More specifically, PA-based techniques, such as the margin infuse relaxed algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer, 2001) are especially well-suited when dealing with a large number of features. Therefore, MIRA is usually applied to models dealing with lots of sparse features (Watanabe et al., 2007; Chiang, 2012). Estimating the model features—in addition to the weights of the log-linear model—is a less explored application of OL techniques. Most relating this, were developed under the umbrella of the CasMaCat project (Alabau et al., 2013). As colophon of it, Ortiz-Martı́nez (2016) developed an incremental derivation of the EM algorithm. Another application of OL techniques in SMT is the adaptation of a trained system to a postediting scenario. Martı́nez-Gómez et al. (2012) and Mathur et al. (2013) used OL for adapting a SMT under a CAT framework. These works are close to ours in the scenarios on which the MT systems are applied. Nevertheless, in our work, we employ an NMT system."

      "text" : "In this work, we use an attentional NMT system similar to the one described by Bahdanau et al. (2015), but using LSTM networks. The input is a sequence of words x in the source language. Each word is linearly projected to a continuous space by means of an embedding matrix. The sequence of word embeddings feeds a bidirectional LSTM, which analyzes the input sequence in both directions, from left to right and vice versa. This network computes a sequence of annotations by concatenating the hidden states from the forward and backward layers. At each decoding timestep, an attention mechanism weights each element from the sequence of annotations, according to the previous decoding state, and computes a joint context vector. The decoder is another LSTM network that takes into account the context vector, the previously generated word and its previous hidden state. Finally, a deep output layer (Pascanu et al., 2014) is employed to compute a distribution over the target language vocabulary. At decoding time, the model approximates the target sentence with a beam-search\n3 method (Sutskever et al., 2014)."

      "text" : "To estimate the model parameters Θ (i.e. the weight matrices), the training objective is to minimize a loss function LΘ, usually the minus loglikelihood over a bilingual parallel corpus T = {(xt,yt)}Tt=1, consisting of T source–target sentence pairs (xt and yt, respectively), with respect to Θ: Θ̂ = arg min Θ LΘ = arg min Θ T∑ t=1 It∑ i=1 − log(p(yt | yt,<i,xt; Θ)) (1) where It is the length of the t-th target sentence. SGD techniques are the predominant way of optimizing neural networks. The goal is to minimize a given loss function LΘ, parametrized by the network parameters. SGD updates the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient of LΘ. The update size is controlled by a learning rate. According to when this updates occur, SGD techniques can be classified in batch, minibatch or online modes. Moreover, depending on how the gradient is computed and applied, a large variety of SGD variants have been proposed (Duchi et al., 2011; Zeiler, 2012; Kingma and Ba, 2014)."

      "heading" : "4 Online gradient descent",
      "text" : "Online SGD updates the model parameters after each sample. Therefore, for a single sample (xt,yt) the parameters update is computed as: ∆Θt = −ρ∇LΘt(xt,yt) (2) where ρ is the learning rate that controls the step size and ∇LΘt is the gradient of the objective function L with respect to Θt. Most optimizers used in deep learning, are variants of this vanilla SGD. Therefore, they can also be applied under the OL framework. In this work, we compared Adagrad, Adadelta and Adam, whose update rules are briefly commented below. Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) aims to perform larger updates for infrequent parameters, defining its update rule as: ∆Θt = − ρ√ Gt + ∇LΘt(xt,yt) where Gt is a vector that contains the sum of the squares of the past gradients with respect to Θ, is the element-wise multiplication, the division is also applied element-wise and is a small value, introduced for numerical stability reasons. Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) is a less aggressive variant of Adadelta, which avoids its constant learning rate decay. Adadelta updates the parameters according to the root mean square (RMS) of the gradients and corrects these updates according to the RMS of the previous update: ∆Θt = −ρ RMS(∆Θt−1) RMS(∇LΘt(xt,yt)) ∇LΘt(xt,yt) The default value for ρ is 1. Nevertheless, in an OL scenario, this value must be lowered, in order to perform less aggressive updates (see Section 7). Finally, Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) computes decaying averages for the past gradients (vt) and the past squared gradients (mt). Such averages are computed following: mt = β1mt−1 + (1− β1)∇LΘt(xt,yt) vt = β2vt−1 + (1− β2∇L2Θt(xt,yt)) where β1 and β2 are two constant values. The parameter update performed by Adam is: ∆Θt = − ρ√ v̂t + m̂t where v̂t = vt1−βt2 and m̂t = mt1−βt1 . The divisions and the square root are computed elementwise and βt denotes β powered to t."

The method aims to perform the minimum modification to the model parameters for compelling with a correctness criterion. Our criterion is directly based on the model loss function (Eq. (1)). Nevertheless, we could employ other loss functions, such as BLEU, although this could be costly. We declined towards this loss due to efficiency reasons. Let ht be the hypothesis generated by the NMT (using the current parameters Θt) of the source sentence xt. We consider that Θt is incorrect if\n4 the model assigns a lower probability to the target reference sentence yt than to ht: pΘt(yt | xt) < pΘt(ht | xt) (3) In this case, we want to search for a Θ̂ such that Θ̂ is close to Θt and pΘ̂(yt | xt) > pΘ̂(ht | xt). This can be expressed with the loss function `: `(Θ̂,xt,yt,ht) = log p Θ̂ (ht | xt)− log pΘ̂(yt | xt) ≤ ξ (4) being ξ ≥ 0 a slack variable, included for providing more flexibility to the method. This can be formulated as a minimization problem with constraints: Θ̂ = arg min Θ 1 2 ‖Θ−Θt‖2 + C ξ s.t. `(Θ,xt,yt,ht) ≤ ξ and ξ ≥ 0 (5) where C is a parameter that controls the aggressiveness of the algorithm (Crammer et al., 2006). From Eq. (5), ξ ≥ max(0, `(Θ,xt,yt,ht)). We define Ft as the function to optimize: Ft(Θ,xt,yt,ht) = 1 2 ‖Θ−Θt‖2 + C max(0, `(Θ,xt,yt,ht)) aiming to find the set of parameters that minimize this function, i.e.: Θ̂ = arg min Θ Ft(Θ,xt,yt,ht) (6) For obtaining Θ̂, we use a subgradient method (Shor et al., 2003). Subgradient methods are iterative algorithms aimed to solve minimization problems with non-differentiable objective functions. Since our function has discontinuity points, such techniques are well-suited. Therefore, we iteratively apply the following weight update: ∆Θt = −ρ ∂ΘFt(Θ,xt,yt,ht)|Θk (7) where ρ is the learning rate and ∂ΘFt is the subgradient of Ft with respect to Θ. We initialize Θk=0 = Θt. This update is applied k times, until reaching some convergence criterion. We denote this passive-aggressive via subgradient methods update rule as PAS."

(5) can be rewritten as: Θ̂ = arg min Θ Gt(Θ,xt,yt,ht)) s.t. ‖Θ−Θt‖2 ≤ C (8) With this expression, we can compute the intermediate weight update: Θ̄k+1 = Θk − ρ ∂ΘGt(Θ,xt,yt,ht)|Θk As in the previous case, we initialize Θk=0 = Θt and iterate following some convergence criterion.

We are post-editing samples from a different domain to that on which our system has been trained. 2. We are post-editing the outputs of a system trained on the same domain of our task, but we have available out-of-domain data. 3. We only have the in-domain data, either for training and testing. For each scenario, we adapt the system on-thefly, applying OL to the post-edited sentences from the test set. The final goal is to reduce the postediting effort required by upcoming samples. The main difference is that in the first case, we exclusively rely on the OL techniques for performing an adaptation of the system to the translation domain; while in the later cases, the NMT systems are already adapted. We measure up to what extent can OL refine this adapted system. Note that we work under a pure OL framework, i.e., each training sample is seen only once.\n5 In a real post-editing scenario, the system produces a translation hypothesis. The user reviews it and corrects the mistakes committed by the system. To test our proposals in this real post-editing scenario it would require real users, which makes it prohibitively costly. Therefore, we simulate the post-editing process by using the reference sentences as post-edited ones. In this simulation, the system generates a hypothesis for a given source sentence. Next, this hypothesis is corrected, producing a new training sample (i.e., the reference sentence). The system updates its parameters with this new sample and advances to the next sentence. This procedure is repeated until the translation process is finished."

Moreover, we used BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and Meteor (Lavie and Denkowski, 2009) for assessing the translation quality of the systems. BLEU compares the ratio of n-gram structures shared between the system hypotheses and reference sentences, while Meteor computes the F1 score of precision and recall between hypotheses and references, additionally considering exact, stemmed, synonyms and paraphrase matches. For all results shown in this work, we compute 95% confidence intervals by means of bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004). The evaluation procedure is as follows: for a given source sentence, we produce its translation. This translation is stored for the posterior evaluation. Next, we take the post-edited sentence (i.e. the reference sentence) and update the NMT system with it. This is repeated until the full set of sentences are translated. We evaluate the stored hypotheses, hoping for a steady improvement as the translation process goes on."

In addition to address the unknown word problem, sub-word-level translation allows us to naturally apply an NMT system from one domain to another. We extracted the BPE codes from the out-of-domain corpus (Europarl) and applied them to each in-domain corpus. Therefore, each corpus is segmented according to the out-of-domain corpus.

Therefore, as described in Section 3, the system consists in an encoder-decoder LSTM network equipped with the attention mechanism described by Bahdanau et al. (2015). For practical reasons, we used single-layered LSTMs. The size of each LSTM is 512, as well as the word embedding size and the attention mechanism layer. As regularization methods, we applied layer normalization (Ba et al., 2016) and Gaussian noise to the weights (σ = 0.01) (Graves, 2011).

We have the general corpus, but we also have enough in-domain data for training a system. In this case, we first train with the out-ofdomain corpus and next with the in-domain corpus. OL can also fine-tune the resulting system, for obtaining a more tailored system and consequently, reducing the post-editing effort. 3. We only have in-domain corpora. This situation is more artificial than the previous ones, but illustrates up to which extent the NMT system can be improved and adapted to a test set by means of OL.

Therefore, we must adapt the system on-the-fly, according to the postedited sentences: as soon as a sentence is translated and corrected, we modify our system, in order to take this sample into account. As baseline, we take an offline system, which remains static along the translation process. First, we study the evolution of the different learning algorithms. Fig. 1 shows the difference in terms of BLEU between the baseline and the online systems, for the Emea test set as a function of the number of processed sentences. We show the average of BLEU up to the n-th sentence. As we can see in Fig. 1, the vanilla SGD algorithm remained steady along the learning process. Adaptive algorithms (Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam) had a more unstable behavior at the early learning stages. This is because these algorithms rely on the accumulation of the past gradients for updating the model weights. Therefore, at the beginning, they present a chaotic behavior, but once they are stabilized, the learning improves. The Adam algorithm clearly exhibits this: it took 400 sentences to improve the baseline, but from here, the enhancement was acute, eventually yielding the best overall performance. On the other hand, PA algorithms remain close to the original system, which denotes an excessive passivity. Fig. 2 shows the overall differences between OL algorithms in terms of BLEU. The dashed line represents our baseline. All three adaptive SGD algorithms were able to significantly improve over 3Tested on a Nvidia GTX1080 GPU with CuDNN 5005.\n7\nthe baseline. Vanilla SGD also yielded small enhancements, although they were non-significant. PA-like algorithms obtained a similar performance to the baseline.\nFinally, Table 3 condenses the results of the adaptation without an in-domain corpus. For the sake of clarity, we only show results for the best performing algorithm for each task. In almost every case, the online system performed significantly better than the offline one. The Emea and TED tasks had a similar difficulty for the outof-domain system and the improvements obtained through OL were alike.\nThe NMT system performed much worse in the XRCE task. This is probably due to the corpus characteristics: since it is extracted from printer manuals, many of its structures are nonexistent in\nthe out-of-domain corpus. Therefore, the performance drops.

      "text" : "In this work, we studied the implementation of OL strategies for NMT. We empirically demonstrated the capacity of NMT for adapting to new\ndomains, by means of gradient descent. Moreover, we discussed and compared a wide range of gradient descent algorithms. In addition, we proposed two novel methods, inspired by a PA strategy and tackled by means of subgradient optimization methods. PA-based methods offer a competitive performance. In almost every case, they outperformed vanilla SGD. Nevertheless, adaptive SGD algorithms performed generally better than PA. We found two cases in which the performance of the PA method was superior to adaptive SGD algorithms, although differences were small. One of the main drawbacks relating the NMT is the independence (up to some point) of the network objective function (probability of the target sentence given the source) with respect to the evaluation metric (e.g. BLEU or TER). Minimum risk training aims to overcome this gap and it has successfully been applied to classical SMT (Och, 2003; Chiang, 2012) and recently to NMT (Shen et al., 2016). In this work, we set the basis for using BLEU or other non-differentiable loss function, since our PAS and PPAS algorithms cope with nondifferentiable functions. As future work, we intend to directly optimize the evaluation metric, integrating it into the online learning framework (Martı́nez-Gómez et al., 2012). A major challenge is keeping the update time at a reasonable time. Finally, interactive machine translation (IMT) is tightly related with this work. IMT consists in an evolution of the classical post-editing scenario, striving for profiting the human effort made in the post-editing process. Under the IMT paradigm, human and computer collaborate in order to minimize the user effort. The development of interactive NMT systems has been recently addressed (Knowles and Koehn, 2016; Peris et al., 2017). The inclusion of OL techniques into the interactive framework is the next natural step to take, in order to develop more adaptive and productive translation systems."
