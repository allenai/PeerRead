      "text" : "Learning word sequence representations has become increasingly useful for a variety of NLP tasks such as document classification (Tang et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016), neural machine translation (NMT) (Cho et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015), question answering (Chen et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015) and summarization (Rush et al., 2015). However, when data are available in multiple languages, representation learning must ad-\ndress two main challenges. Firstly, the computational cost of training separate models for each language grows linearly with their number, or even quadratically in the case of multi-way multilingual NMT (Firat et al., 2016a). Secondly, the models should be capable of cross-language transfer, which is an important component in human language learning (Ringbom, 2007).\nPrevious studies in document classification attempted to overcome these issues by employing multilingual word embeddings which allow direct comparisons and groupings across languages (Klementiev et al., 2012; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Ferreira et al., 2016). However, they are only applicable when common label sets are available across languages which is often not the case (e.g. Wikipedia or news). Moreover, despite recent advances in monolingual document modeling (Tang et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016), multilingual models are still based on shallow networks.\nIn this paper, we propose Multilingual Hierarchical Attention Networks to learn shared document structures across languages for document classification with disjoint label sets, as opposed to training hierarchical attention networks (HANs) in a language-specific manner (Yang et al., 2016).\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n00 89\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nOur networks have a hierarchical structure with word and sentence encoders, along with attention mechanisms. Each of these can either be shared across languages or kept language-specific. To enable cross-language transfer, the networks are trained with multi-task learning across languages using an aligned semantic space as input. Fig. 1 displays document vectors, projected with t-SNE (van der Maaten, 2009), for two topics and two languages, either learned by monolingual HANs (a) or by our multilingual HAN (b). The multilingual HAN achieves better separation between ‘Europe’ and ‘Culture’ topics in English as a result of the knowledge transfer from Arabic.\nWe evaluate our model against strong monolingual baselines, in low-resource and full-resource scenarios, on a large multilingual document collection with 600k documents, labeled with general (1.2k) and specific topics (4.4k), from Deutsche Welle – which we will make available. Our multilingual models outperform monolingual ones in both scenarios, thus confirming the utility of crosslanguage transfer and the computational efficiency of the proposed architecture."

      "text" : "Research on learning multilingual word representations is based on early work on word embeddings (Turian et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014). The goal is to learn an aligned word embedding space for multiple languages by leveraging bilingual dictionaries (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014; Ammar et al., 2016), parallel sentences (Gouws et al., 2015) or comparable documents such as Wikipedia pages (Yih et al., 2011; Al-Rfou et al., 2013). Bilingual embeddings were learned from word alignments using neural language models (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013), including auto-encoders (Chandar et al., 2014). Despite progress at the word level, the document level remains comparatively less explored: the approaches proposed by Hermann and Blunsom (2014) or Ferreira et al. (2016) are based on shallow modeling and are applicable only to classification tasks with label sets shared across languages. These sets are costly to produce, and are often not available in real world settings; here, we remove this constraint. Moreover, we develop new, deeper multilingual document models with hierarchical structure based on prior art at the word level.\nEarly work on neural document classification was based on shallow feed-forward networks, which required unsupervised pre-training (Le and Mikolov, 2014). Later studies focused on neural networks with hierarchical structure. Kim (2014) proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for sentence classification. Johnson and Zhang (2015) proposed a CNN for high-dimensional data classification, while Zhang et al. (2015) adopted a character-level CNN for text classification. Lai et al. (2015) proposed a recurrent CNN to capture sequential information, which outperformed simpler CNNs. Lin et al. (2015) and Tang et al. (2015) proposed hierarchical recurrent NNs and showed that they were superior to CNN-based models. Recently, Yang et al. (2016) demonstrated that a hierarchical attention network with bi-directional gated encoders outperforms traditional and neural baselines. Using such networks in multilingual settings has two drawbacks: the computational complexity increases linearly with the number of languages, and knowledge is acquired separately for each language. We address these issues by proposing a new multilingual model based on HANs, which learns shared document structures and to transfer knowledge across languages.\nEarly examples of attention mechanisms within neural models appeared in computer vision (Larochelle and Hinton, 2010; Denil et al., 2012). In document classification, studies which aimed to learn the importance or saliency of sentences with respect to the classification objective, included Yessenalina et al. (2010); Pappas and PopescuBelis (2014); Yang et al. (2016) and more recently (Pappas and Popescu-Belis, 2017; Ji and Smith, 2017). In NMT, Bahdanau et al. (2015) proposed an attention-based encoder-decoder network, while Luong et al. (2015) proposed a local and ensemble attention model for NMT. Firat et al. (2016a) proposed a single encoder-decoder model with shared attention across language pairs for multi-way, multilingual NMT. Hermann et al. (2015) developed attention-based document readers for question answering. Chen et al. (2015) proposed a recurrent attention model over an external memory. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2015) introduced a dynamic memory network for question answering and other tasks. We propose hierarchical models for long word sequences with shared multi-level attention across languages, which, to our knowledge, has not been attempted before."

Each document xi = {w11, w12, . . . , wKT } is represented by the sequence of d-dimensional embeddings of their words grouped into sentences, T being the maximum number of words in a sentence, and K the maximum number of sentences in a document.\nThe network takes as input a document xi and outputs a document vector ui. In particular, it has two levels of abstraction, word vs. sentence. The former is made of an encoder gw with parameters Hw and an attention aw with parameters Aw, while the latter similarly includes an encoder and an attention (gs, Hs and as, As). The output ui is used by the classification layer to determine yi."

However, it is hard to encode all the relevant input information needed in a fixed-length vector. This problem is addressed by introducing an attention mechanism at each level (noted αw and αs) that estimates the importance of each hidden state vector to the representation of the sentence or document meaning respectively. The sentence vector si ∈ Rdw , where dw is the dimension of the word encoder, is thus obtained as follows:\n1\nT T∑ t=1 α(it)w h (it) w = 1 T T∑ t=1 exp(v>ituw)∑ j exp(v > ijuw) h(it)w\n(3) where vit = fw(h (it) w ) is a fully-connected neural network with Ww parameters.

Moreover, they do not exploit common knowledge across languages or to transfer it from one to another.

We now consider M languages noted L = {Ll | l = 1, . . . ,M}, and a multilingual set of topic-labeled documents D = {(x(l)i , y (l) i ) | i = 1, . . . , Nl} defined as above."

If θmono =\n{H(l)w ,W (l)w , H(l)s ,W (l)s ,W (l)c } are the parameters of multiple independent monolingual models with Dense encoders, then we have:\n|θmono| > |θenc| > |θatt| > |θboth| (7)\nwhere | · | is the number of parameters in a set. For GRU and biGRU encoders, the inequalities still hold, but swapping |θenc| and |θatt|. Excluding the classification layer, the (a) and (b) networks have sublinear numbers of parameters and the (c) network has a constant number of parameters with respect to the number of languages.\nDepending on the label sets, several types of document classification problems can be solved with such architectures. First, label sets can be common or disjoint across languages. Second, considering labels as k-hot vectors, k = 1 corresponds to a multi-class task, while k > 1 is a multi-label task. We focus here on the multi-label problem with disjoint label sets. Moreover, we assume an aligned input space i.e with multilingual word embeddings that have aligned meanings across languages (Ammar et al., 2016). With nonaligned word embeddings, the multilingual transfer is harder due to the complete lack of parallel information, as we show in Section 6."

      "text" : "For training, we replace the monolingual training objective (Eq. 6) with a joint multilingual objective that facilitates the sharing of components, i.e. a subset of parameters for each language θ1, θ2, ..., θM , across different language networks:\nL(θ1,...,θM ) = − 1\nZ M∑ l γl Ne∑ i H(y(l)i , ŷ (l) i ) (8)\nwhere Z = M ×Ne with Ne being the epoch size and γl the importance to give for the objective of\neach language. The joint objective L can be minimized with respect to the parameters θ1, θ2, ..., θM using SGD as before. However, when training on examples from different languages consecutively it is difficult to learn a shared space which works well across languages. This is because each language updates apply only on a subset of parameters and may bias the model away from other languages. To address this, we employ a training strategy similar to Firat et al. (2016a), who sampled parallel sentences for multi-way machine translation from different language pairs in a cyclic fashion. Here, we sample a document-label pair for each language at each iteration."

      "heading" : "5 A New Corpus for Multilingual Document Classification: DW",
      "text" : "Multilingual document classification datasets are usually limited in size, have target categories aligned across languages, and assign documents to only one category. However, classification is often necessary in cases where the categories are not strictly aligned and can be multiple per document. For instance, this is the case for online news agencies keeping track of multilingual news written and annotated by different journalists, a process which is expensive and time-consuming.\nTwo datasets for multilingual document classification have been used in previous studies: Reuters RCV1/RCV2 (6,000 documents, 2 languages and 4 labels) and TED talk transcripts (12,078 documents, 12 languages and 15 labels) introduced by Hermann and Blunsom (2014). The former is tailored for evaluating word embeddings aligned across languages, rather than complex multilingual document models. The latter is twice as large and covers more languages, in a multi-label setting, but biases evaluation by including translations of talks in all languages.\nHere, we present and use a much larger dataset collected from Deutsche Welle, Germany’s public international broadcaster.2 The DW dataset contains nearly 600,000 documents annotated by journalists with several topic labels in 8 languages, shown in Table 1. Documents are on average 2.6 times longer than in Yang et al.’s (2016) monolingual dataset (436 vs. 163 words). There are two types of labels, namely general topics (Yg) and specific ones (Ys) described by one or more words.\n2The dataset contains news visible at www.dw.com and will be made available upon acceptance along with our code.\nWe consider (and count in Table 1) only those specific labels that appear at least 100 times, to avoid sparsity issues.\nThe number of labels varies greatly across DW’s language services. Moreover, we found for instance that only 25-30% of the labels could be manually aligned between English and German. The commonalities are mainly concentrated on the most frequent labels, reflecting a shared top-level division of the news domain, but the long tail exhibits significant independence across languages."

      "text" : "The corpus is split per language into 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for testing. We evaluate both type of labels (Yg, Ys) on a fullresource scenario and only the general topics (Yg) on a low-resource scenario. We report the microaveraged F1 scores for each test set, as in previous work (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014).\nModel configuration. For all models, we use the pre-trained 40-dimensional multilingual embeddings trained on the Leipzig corpus from Ammar et al. (2016). We zero-pad documents up to a maximum of 30 words per sentence and 30 sentences per document. The hyper-parameters were selected on the validation sets. We made the following settings: 100-dimensional encoder and attention embeddings (at every level), relu activation function for all intermediate layers, batch size of 16, epoch size of 25k, γl of 0.5, and optimization using SGD with Adam until convergence.\nAll the hierarchical models have Dense encoders in both scenarios (Tables 2, 4, and 5), and GRU and biGRU in the full-resource scenario for English+Arabic (Table 3). For the low-resource scenario, we define three levels of data availability: tiny from 0.1% to 0.5%, small from 1% to 5% and medium from 10% to 50% of the original training set. We report the average F1 scores on the test set for each level based on discrete increments of 0.1, 1 and 10 respectively. The decision threshold for the full-resource scenario is set to 0.4 for |Ys| < 400 and 0.2 for |Ys| ≥ 400, and for the low-resource scenario it is 0.3 for all sets.\nBaselines. We compare against the following monolingual neural networks, with shallow or hierarchical structure. These networks are based on the state of the art in the field, reviewed in Section 2, and thus represent strong baselines.\n• NN : A neural network which feeds the average vector of the input words directly to a classification layer, as the common baseline for multilingual document classification by Klementiev et al. (2012).\n• HNN : A hierarchical network with encoders and average pooling at every level, followed by a classification layer.\n• HAN: A hierarchical network with encoders and attention, followed by a classification layer. This model is the one proposed by Yang et al. (2016) adapted to our task.\nWhen training our multilingual system with the three options described in Section 4.1 noted as Enc, Att and Both, we use in fact the multilingual version of the third monolingual baseline, as illustrated in Fig. 3, trained with the objective of Eq. 8."

      "heading" : "6.2 Results",
      "text" : "Full-resource Scenario. Table 2 displays the results of full-resource document classification for general and specific labels. In particular, on the left, the performance on the English sub-corpus is shown when an auxiliary sub-corpus from another language is used for training, and on the right the performance on a target sub-corpus is shown when English is used as an auxiliary sub-corpus.\nThe multilingual model trained on pairs of languages outperforms on average all the examined monolingual models, from simple bag-of-words neural models to hierarchical neural models using average pooling or attention. The best-performing multilingual architecture is the one with shared attention across languages, especially when tested on English (documents and labels). Interestingly, this reveals that the transfer of knowledge across languages in a full-resource setting is maximized with language-specific word and sentence encoders, but language-independent (i.e. shared) attention for both words and sentences.\nHowever, when transferring from English to Portuguese (en→pt), Russian (en→ru) and Persian (en→fa) on general categories, it is more effective to have only language-independent compo-\nnents. We hypothesize that this is due to the underlying commonness between the label sets rather than the relationship between languages. The consistent gain for English as target could be attributed to the alignment of the word embeddings to English and to the large number of English labels, which makes it easier to find multilingual labels from which to transfer knowledge.\nWe quantify now the impact of three important model choices on the performance: encoder type, word embeddings, and number of languages used for training. In Table 3, we observe that when we replace the Dense encoder layers with GRU or biGRU layers, the improvement from the multilingual training is still present. In particular, the multilingual models with shared attention are superior to alternatives regardless of the employed encoders. For reference, using simply logistic regression with bag-of-words (counts) for classification leads to F1 scores of 75.8% in English and 81.9% in Arabic, using many more parameters than biGRU: 56.5M vs. 410k in English and 5.8M vs. 364k in Arabic.\nIn Table 4, we observe that when we train our multilingual model (MHAN-att) on eight languages at the same time, the F1 scores improve across languages – for both types of labels, general or specific – while the number of parameters per language decreases, by 36% for Ygeneral and 20% for Yspecific . Lastly, when we train the same model with word embeddings that are not aligned across languages, the performance of the multilingual model drops significantly. An input space that\nis aligned across languages is thus crucial. Low-resource Scenario. We assess the ability of the multilingual attention networks to transfer knowledge across languages in a low-resource scenario. The results for seven languages when trained jointly with English are displayed in Table 5. In all cases, at least one of the multilingual models outperforms the monolingual one, which demonstrates the usefulness of multilingual training for low-resource document classification.\nMoreover, the improvements obtained from our multilingual models for lower levels of availability (tiny and small) are larger than in higher levels (medium). This is also clearly observed in Figure 4 with our multilingual attention network ensemble, i.e. when we do model selection among the three multilingual variants on the development set. The best performing architecture in a majority of cases is the one which shares both the encoders and the attention mechanisms across languages. Moreover, this architecture also has the fewest number\nof parameters for the document modeling.\nThis promising finding for the low-resource scenario means that the classification performance can greatly benefit from the multilingual training (sharing encoders and attention) without increasing the parameters beyond that of a single monolingual document model. Nevertheless, in a few cases, we observe that the other two architectures, with increased complexity perform better than the “shared both” model. For instance, sharing encoders is superior to alternatives for Arabic language, i.e. the knowledge transfer benefits from shared word and sentence representations. Hence, to generalize to a large number of languages, we may need to consider more sophisticated models than sharing a monolingual document model across languages. Lastly, we did not generally observe a negative (or positive) correlation of the closeness between languages with the performance in the low-resource scenario, although the largest improvements were observed on languages more related to English (German, Spanish, Portuguese) than others (Arabic)."

      "text" : "We analyze the performance of the model over the full range of labels, to observe on which type of labels it performs better than the monolingual model, and provide some qualitative examples. Figure 5 shows the cumulative true positive (TP) difference between the monolingual and multilingual models on the Arabic, German, Portuguese and Russian test sets, ordered by label frequency. We can observe that the cumulative TP difference of multilingual model consistently keeps increasing as the frequency of the label decreases. This shows that labels across the entire range of frequencies benefit from joint training with English and not only a subset, e.g. only frequent labels.\nFor example, the top 5 labels on which the multilingual model performed better than the monolingual one for en → de were: russland (21), berlin (19), irak (14), wahlen (13) and nato (13), while for the opposite direction those were: germany (259), german (97), soccer (73), football (47) and merkel (25). These topics are likely better covered in the respective auxiliary language which helps the multilingual model to better distinguish them in the target language. This is also observed in Figure 1, as the improved separation of topics using multilingual model vs. monolingual ones."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We proposed multilingual hierarchical attention networks for document classification and showed that they can benefit both full-resource and lowresource scenarios by using fewer parameters than with monolingual networks. In the former scenario, the most beneficial was to share only the attention mechanisms, while in the latter one, to share the encoders along with the attention mechanisms. These results confirm the merits of language transfer, which is also an important component of human language learning (Odlin, 1989; Ringbom, 2007). Moreover, our study broadens the applicability of multilingual document classification, since our framework is not restricted to common label sets.\nThere are several future directions for this study. In their current form, our models cannot generalize to languages without any example, as attempted by Firat et al. (2016b) for neural MT. This could be achieved by a label-size independent classification layer as in zero-shot classification (Qiao et al., 2016; Nam et al., 2016). More-\nover, although we explored three distinct architectures, other configurations could be examined to improve document modeling, for example by sharing the attention mechanism at the sentence-level only. Lastly, the learning objective could be further constrained with document-level or sentencelevel parallel information, to embed multilingual vectors of similar topics more closely together in the learned space."

However, when multilingual document collections are considered, training such models separately for each language entails linear parameter growth and lack of cross-language transfer. Learning a single multilingual model with fewer parameters is therefore a challenging but potentially beneficial objective. To this end, we propose multilingual hierarchical attention networks for learning document structures, with shared encoders and/or attention mechanisms across languages, using multi-task learning and an aligned semantic space as input. We evaluate the proposed models on multilingual document classification with disjoint label sets, on a large dataset which we provide, with 600k news documents in 8 languages, and 5k labels. The multilingual models outperform strong monolingual ones in lowresource as well as full-resource settings, and use fewer parameters, thus confirming their computational efficiency and the utility of cross-language transfer.",
