      "text" : "Universal Dependencies1 are growing in popularity due to the cross-lingual consistency and large language coverage of the provided data. The initiative has been able to connect researchers across the globe and now includes 64 treebanks in 45 languages. It is therefore not surprising that the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) in 2017 will feature a shared task on “Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies.”\nTo facilitate further research on multilingual parsing and to enable even small teams to participate in the shared task, we are releasing baseline implementations corresponding to our best models. This short paper describes (1) the model structure employed in these models, (2) how the models were trained and (3) an empirical evaluation comparing these models to those in Andor et al. [2016]. Our model uses on the DRAGNN framework [Kong et al., 2017] to improve upon Andor et al. [2016] with dynamically constructed, recurrent transition-based models. The code as well as the pretrained models is available at the SyntaxNet github repository.2 .\nWe note that this paper describes the parsing model used in the baseline. Further releases will describe\nany changes to the segmentation model compared to SyntaxNet."

      "heading" : "2 Character-based representation",
      "text" : "Recent work has shown that learned sub-word representations can improve over both static word embeddings and manually extracted feature sets for describing word morphology. Jozefowicz et al. [2016] use a convolutional model over the characters in each word for language modeling. Similarly, Ling et al. [2015a,b] use a bidirectional LSTM over characters in each word for parsing and machine translation.\n∗Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA. 1http://universaldependencies.org/ 2 https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet\nthe model to learn a hierarchical “multi-timescale” representation of the input, where each layer corresponds to a (learned) larger timescale.\nOur modeling approach is inspired by this multi-timescale architecture in that we generate our computation graph dynamically, but we define the timescales explicitly. The input layer operates on characters and the subsequent layer operates on words, where the word representation is simply the hidden state computed by the first layer at each word boundary. In principle, this structure permits fully dynamic word representations based on left context (unlike previous work) and simplifies recurrent computation at the word level (unlike previous work with standard stacked LSTMs [Gillick et al., 2015]).\nMore related work [Kim et al., 2015, Miyamoto and Cho, 2016, Lankinen et al., 2016, Ling et al., 2015a] describes alternate neural network architectures for combining character- and word-level modeling for various tasks. Like Ballesteros et al. [2015], we use character-based LSTMs to improve the Stack-LSTM Dyer et al. [2015] model for dependency parsing, but we share a single LSTM run over the entire sentence."

      "heading" : "3 Model",
      "text" : "Our model combines the recurrent multi-task parsing model of Kong et al. [2017] with character-based representations learned by a LSTM. Given a tokenized text input, the model processes as follows:\n• A single LSTM processes the entire character string (including whitespace)3 left-to-right. The last\nhidden state in a given token (as given by the word boundaries) is used to represent that word in subsequent parts of the model.\n• A single LSTM processes the word representations (from the first step) in right-to-left order. We call\nthis the “lookahead” model.\n• A single LSTM processes the lookahead representations right-to-left. This LSTM has a softmax layer\nwhich is trained to predict POS tags, and we refer to it as the “tagger” model.\n• The recurrent compositional parsing model [Kong et al., 2017] predicts parse tree left-to-right using\nthe arc-standard transition system. Given a stack s and a input pointer to the buffer i, the parser dynamically links and concatenates the following input representations:\n– Recurrently, the two steps that last modified the so and s1 (either SHIFT or REDUCE opera-\ntions).\n– From the tagger layer, the hidden representations for s0, s1, and i.\n– From the lookahead layer, the hidden representation for i.\n– All are projected to 64 dimensions before concatenating.\n– The parser also extracts 12 discrete features for previously predicted parse labels, the same as in\nKong et al. [2017].\nAt inference time, we use beam decoding in the parser with a beam size of 8. We do not use local normalization, and instead train the models with “self-normalization” (see below).\nThis model is implemented using the DRAGNN framework in TensorFlow. All code is publicly available at the SyntaxNet repository. The code provides tools to visualize the unrolled structure of the graph at runtime.\n3In our UD v1.3 experiments, the raw text string is not available. Since we use gold segmentations, the whitespace is artificially\ninduced, and functions as a “new word” signal for languages with no naturally occuring whitespace.\nWe train using the multi-task, maximum-likelihood “stack-propagation” method described in Kong et al. [2017] and Zhang and Weiss [2016]. Specifically, we use the gold labels to alternate between two updates:\n1. TAGGER: We unroll the first three LSTMs and backpropagate gradients computed from the POS tags.\n2. PARSER: We unroll the entire model, and backpropagate gradients computed from the oracle parse\nsequence.\nWe use the following schedule: pretrain TAGGER for 10,000 iterations. Then alternate TAGGER and\nPARSER updates at a ratio of 1:8 until convergence.\nTo optimize for beam decoding, we regularize the softmax objective to be “self-normalized.”Vaswani et al.\n[2013], Andreas and Klein [2015]. With this modification to the softmax, the log scores of the model are encouraged (but not constrained) to sum to one. We find that this helps mitigate some of the bias induced by local normalization Andor et al. [2016], while being fast and efficient to train."

      "heading" : "3.2 Hyperparameters",
      "text" : "Like the ratio above, many hyperparameters, including design decisions, were tuned to find reasonable values before training all 64 baseline models. While the full recipe can be deciphered from the code, here are some key points for practitioners:\n• We use Layer Normalization [Ba et al., 2016] in all of our networks, both LSTM and the recurrent\nparser’s Relu network cell.\n• We always project the LSTM hidden representations down from 256→64 when we pass from one\ncomponent to another.\n• We use moving averages of parameters at inference time.\n• We use the following ADAM recipe: β1 = β2 = 0.9, and set ǫ to be one of 10 −3, 10−4, 10−5\n(typically 10−4).\n• We normalize all gradients to have unit norm before applying the ADAM updates.\n• We use dropout both recurrently and on the inputs, at the same rate (typically 0.7 or 0.8).\n• We use a minibatch size of 4, with 4 asynchronous training threads doing asynchronous SGD."

Our results are in Table 1. We observe that the new model outperforms the original SyntaxNet baselines, sometimes quite dramatically (e.g. on Latvian, by close to 12% absolute LAS.) We note that this is not an exhaustive experiment, and further study is warranted in the future. Nonethelss, these results show that the new baselines compare very favorably to at least one publicly available state-of-the-art baseline.\nWe provide pre-trained models for all 64 treebanks in the CoNLL2017 Shared Task on the SyntaxNet website.
