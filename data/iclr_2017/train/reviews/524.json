{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Dataset Augmentation in Feature Space", "abstract": "Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed, implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "In this paper authors propose a novel data augmentation scheme where instead of augmenting the input data, they augment intermediate feature representations.  Sequence auto-encoder based features are considered, and random perturbation, feature interpolation, and extrapolation based augmentation are evaluated.

Overall this paper is a good contribution. However, the idea seems unlikely to have much impact for two reasons:\n  - It's unclear when we should expect this method to help vs hurt\n  - Relatedly, the method has a number of hyperparameters that it's unclear how to set except by cross-validation.\n \n We also want to remark that other regularization methods effectively already do closely related things. Dropout, gradient noise, and Bayesian methods, for instance, effectively produce 'synthetic data' in a similar way when the high-level weights of the network are perturbed.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Update regarding CIFAR-10 Wide ResNet results", "OTHER_KEYS": "Terrance DeVries", "comments": "In our previous experiments with the Wide ResNet architecture (see our response to Reviewer1's review for details) we tested to see whether using reconstructed inputs, rather than context vectors, still yielded improved model performance. In these tests we encoded CIFAR-10 images with the encoder portion of a sequence autoencoder, extrapolated between the resulting context vectors, and then projected the context vectors back into input space with the decoder to reconstruct augmented images. The newly generated images were then added to the original dataset. We found that this data augmentation approach resulted in worse classification performance compared to the baseline model. However, we also observed that training a model on only reconstructed images (encoded then decoded, with no extrapolation) yielded results much worse than the equivalent test trained on unmodified data. We hypothesized that the decrease in performance from the tests with extrapolation may possibly be attributed to the decoder's reconstruction error rather than the effects of extrapolation. \n\nTo isolate the effects of extrapolation we conducted several more experiments, this time using reconstructed samples for all tests so that reconstruction error affected all tests equally. Any difference between baseline and extrapolation tests could now be contributed solely to the effects of extrapolation. The results from our tests are shown below:\n\nTest 1 - 24x24 reconstructions, center crop: 18.75 +/- 0.24 (% test error)\nTest 2 - 24x24 reconstructions, center crop + extrapolation: 17.72 +/- 0.45 (% test error)\nTest 3 - 24x24 reconstructions, simple data augmentation (shift + mirror): 13.55 +/- 0.15 (% test error)\nTest 4 - 24x24 reconstructions, simple data augmentation + extrapolation: 11.99 +/- 0.11 (% test error)\n\nIn these tests we observed a consistent reduction in classification error when feature space extrapolation is applied: about 1% reduction in test error when applied to 24x24 center crops of the original images, and a 1.5% reduction in test error when coupled with input space data augmentation. We believe that these results demonstrate the potential benefits of the feature space extrapolation technique, which persist even when applied to complex model architectures such as Wide ResNet. As previously mentioned we are currently investigating methods which may reduce the reconstruction error introduced during the decoding process.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "25 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "TDLR: The authors present a regularization method wherein they add noise to some representation space. The paper mainly applies the technique w/ sequence autoencoders (Dai et al., 2015) without the usage of attention (i.e., only using the context vector). Experimental results show improvement from author's baseline on some toy tasks.\n\n=== Augmentation ===\nThe augmentation process is simple enough, take the seq2seq context vector and add noise/interpolate/extrapolate to it (Section 3.2). This reviewer is very curious whether this process will also work in non seq2seq applications. \n\nThis reviewer would have liked to see comparison with dropout on the context vector.\n\n=== Experiments ===\nSince the authors are experimenting w/ seq2seq architectures, its a little bit disappointing they didn't compare it w/ Machine Translation (MT), where there are many published papers to compare to.\n\nThe authors did compare their method on several toy datasets (that are less commonly used in DL literature) and MNIST/CIFAR. The authors show improvement over their own baselines on several toy datasets. The improvement on MNIST/CIFAR over the author's baseline seems marginal at best. The author also didn't cite/compare to the baseline published by Dai et al., 2015 for CIFAR -- here they have a much better LSTM baseline of 25% for CIFAR which beats the author's baseline of 32.35% and the author's method of 31.93%.\n\nThe experiments would be much more convincing if they did it on seq2seq+MT on say EN-FR or EN-DE. There is almost no excuse why the experiments wasn't run on the MT task, given this is the first application of seq2seq was born from. Even if not MT, then at least the sentiment analysis tasks (IMDB/Rotten Tomatoes) of the Dai et al., 2015 paper which this paper is so heavily based on for the sequence autoencoder.\n\n=== References ===\nSomething is wrong w/ your references latex setting?
