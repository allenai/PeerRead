While methods for nonlinear two-view representation learning (Deep CCA, (Andrew et al., 2013)) and linear many-view representation learning (Generalized CCA (Horst, 1961)) exist, DGCCA is the first CCA-style multiview representation learning technique that combines the flexibility of nonlinear (deep) representation learning with the statistical power of incorporating information from many independent sources, or views. We present the DGCCA formulation as well as an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm for solving it. We learn DGCCA representations on two distinct datasets for three downstream tasks: phonetic transcription from acoustic and articulatory measurements, and recommending hashtags and friends on a dataset of Twitter users. We find that DGCCA representations soundly beat existing methods at phonetic transcription and hashtag recommendation, and in general perform no worse than standard linear many-view techniques.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The proposed method is simple and elegant; it builds upon the huge success of gradient based optimization for deep non-linear function approximators and combines it with established (linear) many-view CCA methods.

In terms of technical novelty, the generalization follows rather straightforwardly. Reviewers have expressed the need to clarify relationship and provide comparisons to existing proposals for combining deep learning with CCA. As such the paper has been evaluated to be borderline. The proposed method appears to yield significant gains on a speech dataset, though comparisons on other datasets appear to be less conclusive. Some basic baselines as missing, e.g., concatenating views and running a deep model, or using much older nonlinear extensions of CCA such as kernel CCA (e.g. accelerated via random features, and combined with deep representations underneath).", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Draft revised, added prior work section", "OTHER_KEYS": "Adrian Benton", "comments": "Thank you for your helpful comments.  We just uploaded a revised draft, incorporating the reviewers' suggestions, and hopefully addressing many of their concerns.  Below are the things to note:\n\n- The linear GCCA solution for G and U is included in Appendix A, along with a full gradient derivation: \"... the rows of G are the top r (orthonormal) eigenvectors of M, and $U_j = C_{jj}^{\u22121} Y_j G^T$\" (reviewer 2)\n\n- In the last paragraph of the Optimization subsection (page 4), we include big-Oh notation for the gradient update time complexity.  We leverage the GCCA solution presented in [R1] to scale DGCCA to large datasets. (reviewer 2)\n\n- We qualify the pronouncement of being \"the first nonlinear multiview learning technique\" with the adjective \"CCA-style\".  Although our work focuses on extending CCA-based multiview methods, we recognize that others have attempted to learn embeddings by merging information from multiple views. (reviewer 5)\n\n- In Section 5, \"Other Multiview Work\", we include a discussion of a non-CCA-based techniques for nonlinear representation learning from multiple views, and how they differ from DGCCA.  As reviewers 2 and 5 mention, the multiview learning literature is vast, and we are not able to address all models proposed that make learned representations from more than one view.  However, we do hope that this section will clarify how our proposed model differs from other representation learning techniques exploiting multiple views. (reviewers 2 and 5)\n\n- Appendix C includes a short discussion of how the DGCCA objective reconstruction error relates to downstream task performance for Twitter hashtag recommendation.  In short, we found that high reconstruction error is a strong signal for poor downstream performance, but there is significant variation in downstream performance between embeddings learned by models with low reconstruction error. (reviewer 4)\n\nWe also trained Bridge Correlational Neural Network embeddings for Twitter hashtag and friend recommendation in a series of preliminary experiments.  We swept over hidden layer width in the same range as the DGCCA experiments, $\\lambda \\in \\{0.0, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0\\}$ (the strength of the correlation term in the DGCCA objective), and used either the Twitter user ego text view or their friend network view as the pivot view, since these were the solely most effective views for hashtag and friend recommendtion.  Other learning parameters were left at the defaults and networks were trained for 50 epochs.  However, the performance of these embeddings was much worse than the CCA-style models we compare to (R@1000=0.06 for hashtag recommendation.)  We grant that downstream performance would be improved by tuning learning parameters, but these preliminary experiments underscore the fact that this class of models is not a panacea, and may not be appropriate for these recommendation tasks.  We explicitly note this in the text, since these models assume that all views should be correlated with a pivot view representation.  Entraining all embeddings to a single view is, thus, probably not as effective at hashtag recommendation as learning a CCA-style joint representation for all views.

[R1] proposes a Multiview representation learning method which is both non-linear and capable of handling more than 2 views. This is very much relevant to what authors are proposing. The objective function proposed in [R1] maximizes the correlation between views and minimizes the self and cross reconstruction errors.
