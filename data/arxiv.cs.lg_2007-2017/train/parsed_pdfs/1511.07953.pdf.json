Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM models were constructed, with SVM giving the best results: an improvement of 12.9% over binary models was achieved for hold out cross validation by augmenting with pairwise correlation probabilities of the labels.\nII. Introduction\nMulti-label classification is the set of classification problems where the output vector has a variable length. The average number of labels per review varies across datasets, and in general is a function of the semantics of the text rather than the syntax. The learning algorithm needs to estimate the number of labels and make the correct predictions.\nPreviously multi-label classification problems were solved using problem transformation techniques (converting the problem into binary classification problems per output label), or by adapting the algorithm to directly perform multi-label classification [1]. This paper extracts correlation information between labels and factors the joint probabilities into the model."

We aim to make the algorithm portable across various datasets, i.e., training a model on amazon reviews and using it to classify tweets from Twitter."

The Twitter dataset has 100,000 tweets. Both the datasets have the same schema, and each review and tweet has a unique ID, pre-pruned content, and a tree of all of the product labels for the review up to the Book category at the root."

      "heading" : "V. Theory",
      "text" : "Our approach augments the independent binary classification model. In addition to the individual probabilities, this also looks at the probability of labels\noccurring together. Hence the Inference algorithm models the formula –\nP ( y(m)|x(m) ) = ∏ i P ( y (m) i |x (m) )∏ j,k P ( y (m) j , y (m) k )α where yi = {0, 1}, j, k ∈ {i|yi = 1}, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1\nP (y (m) i |x(m)) represents the probability of the independent binary model for label i classifying as 0\nor 1 given input x. ∏ i P ( y (m) i |x(m) ) represents the assignment of 0 or 1 to all yi that maximizes the joint probability.\nThe pairwise correlation probability between each pair of labels is stored in the correlation matrix. This normalized rows of the matrix represent probability of a particular label’s coupling with every other label except for itself. This probability is computed as a prior for the entire dataset and is not dependent on the input feature vector itself. It is represented by P (y (m) j , y\n(m) k ).∏ j,k P ( y (m) j , y (m) k )α represents the joint probability of all pairwise combinations of predicted labels, each discounted by α. The probabilities obtained from the correlation matrix are given less weight than the probabilities obtained from independent models, hence the discount. This is because co-occurrence of labels is not completely characterized by correlation, it also requires the higher order moments which significantly increase the computational overhead."

Hyper-parameters need to be tuned for each dataset.\nLIBLINEAR works well for larger datasets while LIBSVM works well for custom and smaller datasets. LIBLINEAR only supports a linear Kernel but is very fast relative to LIBSVM and hence used in the learning algorithms [4]."

For instance a top level label is ”Literature and Fiction” and few sub labels associated with it are ”Folklore”, ”Mysteries” and ”Classics.” The reviews are labelled with these sub-level labels which we map to one of the 31 top-level labels, and use for multi-label classification."

Each Book review is mapped to a bag-of-words based input feature. On parsing a review, its content is pruned and stemmed and then a tf-idf based vector is generated which is used as the input feature x. The labels corresponding to this review are associated as its outputs y.\nThe correlation matrix is built by parsing 100,000 Book reviews and creating pairwise counts of different labels – a 31 × 31 row normalized matrix with Laplace Smoothing. After normalization the matrix is not symmetric, so the geometric mean of cells (i, j)and (j, i) is treated as the actual correlation probability for two labels. Fig 1. plots the row normalized covariance matrix for Amazon dataset. The existence of large peaks is the motivation behind the algorithm."

The reason behind this is that over-predictions can be further controlled using added heuristics, but the labels missed can never be regained without looking at the entire output label set again.\nError = 1− ( Total labels correctly predicted\nNumber of labels in ground truth ) × ( Total labels correctly predicted\nTotal labels predicted )γ γ is a hyper-parameter which cannot be tuned since that would put it to ∞, and J and K as 31, i.e. output all the labels, irrespective of the input, since this gives zero error."

The gain is only about 0.1%, which can be attributed to the scarcity of content per Twitter review (the dataset size for Twitter was about 12% of Amazon’s for same number of reviews). Upon inspecting the output labels predicted by our algorithm, it was apparent that, the over predictions were the major contributors to the error, unlike Amazon where Misses were the prime error contributors."

Fig 4. gives the performance of our algorithm when the training was\ndone using Amazon’s dataset and testing was done on Twitter’s dataset. The hyper-parameters used are the same as those for Fig 2.

While our algorithm had observed a 10 % improvement over the collection of independent binary models for the Hold out cross validation, the same did not hold true for the results obtained from the K-fold cross validation.\nTraining and testing on Amazon no longer gave any improvement, but about a 2% degradation in performance. The results for Twitter dataset also substantially changed, but since both the algorithms got similar shifts, the actual improvements were still marginal as before.\nWe attribute the correlation algorthim’s poor performance to two causes. First, Amazon dataset’s number\n4 of labels per review has a mean of 3.06 and a standard deviation of 1.3. Because the standard deviation is reasonably high, it can be expected that the average number of labels per review for a given partition may be quite different from the global average. This causes our algorithm to produce many false positives when testing on some partitions where the number of labels per review is much lower than average.\nAlso, because our fixed correlation matrix is calculated from 100,000 samples tending towards the true correlation values, some test data partitions are likely to deviate from this average (highly biased test datasets), causing our algorithm to predict based on the true correlation, while the baseline algorithm ignores correlation and trains only on the training data. This hypothesis is supported by smoothing out the bias by increasing K, in which case the two algorithms’ errors converge."

SVM however, had a noticeable trend and scaled best with increasing dataset.\nThen each model was augmented with the correlation matrix. SVM gave best results and was then optimized by adjusting hyper-parameters."

      "heading" : "Bias and Variance",
      "text" : "As evident, the observed training error for each dataset was much less than the observed test error, indicating high variance and low bias. To further investigate, Principal Component Analysis was used. Since the feature vectors were based on word occurrences in text, they were significantly larger than the dataset size – the observed feature size for 2500 dataset size of Amazon reviews was 12000. Due to computational limitations, straightforward PCA was infeasible.\nSparse notation was used to represent feature vector,\nfrom Python’s numpy library. Then Sparse SVD (singular value decomposition) found the smallest subspace that the Feature matrix mapped to, keeping all singular values greater than 1. This significantly reduced the dataset size. The 2500 dataset of Amazon reviews, now reduced to a feature vector of size 2300. While the number of features was still comparable to the number of data points, it was substantially lower than the size of the raw feature vector (1/6).\nThis experimentation exposed two facts. The errors were still the same, but the computation time rose significantly (about five times the previous duration). It was seen that LibLinear, the python library, was tuned to work with large datasets with document based feature vectors (as compared to LibSvm), and not for any general features.\nSince the baseline itself suffers from the issue of high variance and low bias, any augmentations over it would be unable to resolve this by themselves, and would require modifying how the TF-IDF vectors are generated. We had already stemmed the words to check this issue, but evidently this would require a more careful processing of the reviews, before they are converted to features. Moreover, since SVMs enforce larger margin as a metric to evaluate each point, they end with a much lower VC dimension than the size of the feature vector. This was another reason in favor of SVM over Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.\nThe baseline resulted in about 10% training error, while our algorithm resulted in about 15% training error. Thus there is an increased bias, although the higher variance is a more pressing issue because the test error is significantly higher than training error for both algorithms."
    }, {
      "heading" : "X. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Using the correlation matrix to help classify reviews appeared to be a good approach, justified by peaks in correlation. The results show, however, that when performing multi-label classification with a sufficiently sized feature set, augmentation of an independent model with second order correlation probability shows only marginal improvements.\nThe model was modified from the baseline by adding a single feature: second order correlation. This is the greedy method of selecting features, in contrast to exploring correlation of all combinations of labels. In such a case where we did not explore higher order correlation we could have missed, for example, that labels A, B, and C never occur together – a piece of information that could have proved vital to the model’s representation of the true data. Thus, if computation time and space are not an issue, higher order correlation should be considered.\n6 Additionally, SVM, as was already known, has shown to be best for learning on large feature sets because it will attempt to reduce the set and hence generalize better."

The number of labels for each review could be predicted by using unsupervised techniques such as k-means clustering on label probabilities.\nThe datasets have different inherent structures which\ndo not generalize well when using a common learning algorithm. For the Twitter dataset, each feature vector is about 12% the size of a corresponding feature vector in the Amazon dataset. The features should be supplemented with options such as semantic relations in text to make classifications and context of user history.\nThe reviews have sub-level labels associated with them which are rolled up to first-level labels to make the classifications. The algorithm should extend to make hierarchical classifications."
