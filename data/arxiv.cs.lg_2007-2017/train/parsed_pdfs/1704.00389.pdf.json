INTRODUCTION\nTHE field of human action recognition has advancedrapidly over the past few years. We have moved from manually designed features [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] to learned convolutional neural network (CNN) features [6], [7], [8], [9]; from encoding appearance information to encoding motion information [10], [11], [12], [13]; and from learning local features to learning global video features [14], [15], [16], [17]. The performance has continued to soar higher as we incorporate more of the steps into an end-to-end learning framework. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art CNN structures we are using still have difficulty in capturing motion information directly from video frames. Instead, traditional local optical flow estimation methods are used to pre-compute motion information for the CNNs. This two-stage pipeline is sub-optimal for the following reasons:\nThis work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IIS-1251187.

Hauptmann are with the Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213 USA (email: {lanzhzh,alex}@cs.cmu.edu)\n• The pre-computation of optical flow is time consuming and storage demanding compared to the CNN step. Even when using GPUs, optical flow calculation has been the major computational bottleneck of the current two-stream approaches [10], which learn to encode appearance and motion information in two separate CNNs. • Traditional optical flow estimation is completely independent of the high-level final tasks like action recognition and is therefore sub-optimal. Because it is not end-toend trainable, we cannot extract motion information that is optimal for the desired tasks.\nOur primary aim, therefore, is to move toward end-to-end learning by incorporating the optical flow estimation into the CNN framework. We hope that, by taking consecutive video frames as inputs, our CNNs learn the temporal relationships among pixels and use the relationships to predict action classes. Theoretically, given how powerful CNNs are for image processing tasks, it would make sense use them for a low-level task like optical flow estimation. However, in practice, we still face many challenges. Here are the main ones: • We need to train the models without supervision. The\nground truth flow required for supervised training is usually not available except for limited synthetic data. We can perform weak supervision by using the optical flow calculated from traditional methods [18]. However, the accuracy of the learned models would be limited by the accuracy of the traditional methods. • We need to train our optical flow estimation models from scratch. The models (filters) learned for optical flow estimation tasks are very different from models (filters) learned for other image processing tasks such as object recognition [19]. Hence, we can not pre-train our model using other tasks such as the ImageNet challenges.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 38\n9v 3\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n2 O\nct 2\n01 7\n2 • We cannot simply use the traditional optical flow estimation loss functions. We are concerned chiefly with how to learn optimal motion representation for video action recognition. Therefore, our optimization goal is more than just minimizing the endpoint errors (EPE) [20], [21], [22], [23].\nTo address these challenges, we first train a CNN with the goal of generating optical flow from a set of consecutive frames. Through a set of specially designed operators and unsupervised loss functions, our new training step can generate optical flow that is similar to that generated by one of the best traditional methods [24]. As illustrated in Figure 1, we call this network as MotionNet. Given the MotionNet, we concatenate it with a temporal stream CNN that projects the estimated optical flow to the target action labels. We then fine-tune this stacked temporal stream CNN in an end-to-end manner with the goal of predicting action classes for the input frames. Our end-to-end stacked temporal stream CNN has multiple advantages over the traditional two-stage approach: • First, it does not require any additional label information\nhence there are no upfront costs. • Second, it is computationally much more efficient. It is\nabout 10x faster than traditional approaches. • Third, it is much more storage efficient. Due to the high\noptical flow prediction speed, we do not need to precompute optical flow and store it on disk. Instead, we predict it on-the-fly. • Last but not least, it has much more room for improvement. Traditional optical flow estimation methods have been studied for decades and the room for improvement is limited. In contrast, our end-to-end and implicit optical flow estimation is completely different as it connects to the final tasks.\nWe call our new two-stream approach hidden two-stream networks as it implicitly generates motion information for action recognition. It is important to distinguish between these two ways of introducing motion information to the encoding CNNs. Although optical flow is currently being used to represent the motion information in the videos, we do not know whether it is an optimal representation. There might be an underlying motion representation that is better than optical flow. Therefore, we believe that end-to-end training is a better solution than a two-stage approach. Before we introduce our new method in detail, we provide some background on our work in this paper."

      "text" : "Significant advances in understanding human activities in video have been achieved over the past few years [25]. Initially, traditional handcrafted features such as Improved Dense Trajectories (IDT) [1] dominated the field of video analysis for several years. Despite their superior performance, IDT and its improvements [2], [3], [26], [27] are computationally formidable for real applications. CNNs [7], [28], [6], which are often several orders of magnitude faster than IDTs, performed much worse than IDTs in the beginning. This inferior performance is mostly because CNNs have difficulty\nin capturing motion information among frames. Later on, two-stream CNNs [10], [11] addressed this problem by precomputing the optical flow using traditional optical flow estimation methods [24] and training a separate CNN to encode the pre-computed optical flow. This additional stream (a.k.a., the temporal stream) significantly improved the accuracy of CNNs and finally allowed them to outperform IDTs on several benchmark action recognition datasets [29]. These accuracy improvements indicate the importance of temporal motion information for action recognition as well as the inability of existing CNNs to capture such information.\nHowever, compared to the CNN, the optical flow calculation is computationally expensive. It is the major speed bottleneck of the current two-stream approaches. As an alternative, Zhang et al. [30] proposed to use motion vectors, which can be obtained directly from compressed videos without extra calculation, to replace the more precise optical flow. This simple improvement brought more than 20x speedup compared to the traditional two-stream approaches. However, this speed improvement came with an equally significant accuracy drop. The encoded motion vectors lack fine structures, and contain noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to much worse accuracy compared to the more precise optical flow [24]. These weaknesses are fundamental and can not be improved. Another more promising approach is to learn to predict optical flow using supervised CNNs, which is closer to our approach. There are two representative works in this direction. Ng. et al. [18] used optical flow calculated by traditional methods as supervision to train a network to predict optical flow. This method avoids the pre-computation of optical flow at inference time and greatly speeds up the process. However, as we will demonstrate later, the quality of the optical flow calculated by this approach is limited by the quality of the traditional flow estimation, which again limits its potential on action recognition. The other representative work is by Ilg et al. [31] which uses the network trained on synthetic data where ground truth flow exists. The performance of this approach is again limited by the quality of the data used for supervision. The ability of synthetic data to represent the complexity of real data is very limited. Actually, in Ilg et al. [31]’s work, they show that there is a domain gap between real data and synthetic data. To address this gap, they simply grow the synthetic data to narrow the gap. The problem with this solution is that it may not work for other datasets and it is not feasible to do this for all datasets. Our work addresses the optical flow estimation problem in a much more fundamental and promising way. We predict optical flow on-the-fly using CNNs, thus addressing the computation and storage problems. And we perform unsupervised pre-training on real data, thus addressing the domain gap problem.\nAnother weakness of the current two-stream CNN approach is that it maps local video snippets to global labels. In image classification, we often take a whole image as the input to CNNs. However, in video classification, because of the much larger size of videos, we often use sampled frames/clips as inputs. One major problem of this common practice is that video-level label information can be incomplete or even missing at frame/clip-level. This information mismatch leads\n3\nto the problem of false label assignment, which motivates another line of research, one that tries to do CNN-based video classification beyond short snippets. Ng et al. [32] reduced the dimension of each frame/clip using a CNN and aggregated frame-level information using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Varol et al. [33] stated that Ng et al.’s approach is sub-optimal as it breaks the temporal structure of videos in the CNN step. Instead, they proposed to reduce the size of each frame and use longer clips (eg, 60 vs 16 frames) as inputs. They managed to gain significant accuracy improvements compared to shorter clips with the same spatial size. However, in order to make the model fit into GPU memory, they have to reduce the spatial resolution which comes at a cost of a large accuracy drop. In the end, the overall accuracy improvement is less impressive. Wang et al. [15] experimented with sparse sampling and jointly trained on the sparsely sampled frames/clips. In this way, they incorporate more temporal information while preserving the spatial resolution. Lan et al. [34] took a step forward along this line by using the networks of Wang et al. [15] to scan through the whole video, aggregate the features (output of a layer of the network) using pooling methods, and fine-tune the last layer of the network using the aggregated features. We believe that this approach is still sub-optimal as it again breaks the end-to-end learning into a two-stage approach. Recent approaches [16], [35], [36] evolve to end-to-end learning and are currently the best at incorporating global temporal information. They thus represent the state-of-the-art in this field. In this paper, we do not address the false label problem because we only use the basic two-stream approach of Wang et al. [11]. Nevertheless, all the methods addressing the false label problem should also be able to further improve our method."

      "text" : "We treat the optical flow estimation as an image reconstruction problem [37]. Basically, given a frame pair, we hope to generate the optical flow that allows us to reconstruct one frame from the other. Formally, taking a pair of adjacent frames I1 and I2 as input, our CNN generates a flow field V . Then using the predicted flow field V and I2, we hope to get the reconstructed frame I ′1 using inverse warping, i.e., I ′1 = T [I2, V ], where T is the inverse warping function. Our\ngoal is to minimize the photometric error between I1 and I ′1. The intuition is that if the estimated flow and the next frame can be used to reconstruct the current frame perfectly, then the network should have learned useful representations of the underlying motions. MotionNet Our MotionNet is a fully convolutional network, consisting of a contracting part and an expanding part. The contracting part is a stack of convolutional layers and the expanding part is a chain of combined of convolutional and deconvolutional layers. An illustration can be visualized in Figure 1. The details of our network can be seen in Table I, where the top part represents our MotionNet and the bottom part is the traditional temporal stream CNN. We describe the challenges and proposed good practices to learn better motion representation for action recognition below.\nFirst, we design a network that focuses on a small amount of displacement motion. For real data such as YouTube videos, we often encounter the problem that foreground motion (human actions of interest) is small, but the background motion (camera motion) is dominant. Thus, we adopt 3 × 3 kernels throughout the network to detect local, small motions. Besides, in order to keep the small motions, we would like to keep the high frequency image details till late stage. As can be seen in Table I, our first two convolutional layers (conv1 and conv1 1 ) do not use striding. This strategy also allows our deep network ready be applied to low resolution images. We use strided convolution instead of pooling for image\n4\ndownsampling because pooling is shown to be harmful for dense per-pixel prediction tasks.\nSecond, our MotionNet computes multiple losses at multiple scales. Due to the skip connections between the contracting and expanding parts, the intermediate losses can regularize each other and guide earlier layers to converge faster to the final objective. We explore three loss functions that help us to generate better optical flow. These loss functions are as follows. • A standard pixelwise reconstruction error function, which\nis calculated as:\nLpixel = 1\nN N∑ i,j ρ(I1(i, j)− I2(i+ V xi,j , j + V y i,j)). (1)\nThe V x and V y are the estimated optical flow in horizontal and vertical directions. The inverse warping T is performed using a spatial transformer module [38]. Here we use a robust convex error function, the generalized Charbonnier penalty ρ(x) = (x2 + 2)α, to reduce the influence of outliers. N denotes the cardinality of the input frame. • A smoothness loss that addresses the aperture problem that causes ambiguity in estimating motions in nontextured regions. It is calculated as:\nLsmooth = ρ(∇V xx )+ρ(∇V xy )+ρ(∇V yx )+ρ(∇V yy ). (2)\n∇V xx and ∇V xy are the gradients of the estimated flow field V x in the horizontal and vertical directions. Similarly, ∇V yx and ∇V yy are the gradients of V y . The generalized Charbonnier penalty ρ(x) is the same as in the pixelwise loss. • A structural similarity (SSIM) loss function that helps us to learn the structure of the frames. It is calculated as:\nLssim = 1\nN\n∑ (1− SSIM(I1, I ′1)). (3)\nSSIM(·) is a standard structural similarity function. Our experiments show that this simple strategy significantly improves the quality of our estimated flows. It forces our MotionNet to produce flow fields with clear motion boundaries.\nThe overall loss of our MotionNet is a weighted sum of the pixelwise reconstruction loss, the piecewise smoothness loss, and the region-based SSIM loss,\nL = λ1 · Lpixel + λ2 · Lsmooth + λ3 · Lssim (4)\nwhere λ1, λ2, and λ3 weight the relative importance of the different metrics during training. We describe how we determine the values of these loss weights in Section IV-B.\nThird, unsupervised learning of optical flow introduces artifacts in homogeneous regions because the brightness assumption is violated. We insert additional convolutional layers between deconvolutional layers (xconvs in Table I) in the expanding part to yield smoother motion estimation. We also explored other techniques in the literature, like adding flow confidence [39] and multiplying with original color images\n[31] during expanding, however, we did not observe improvements.\nIn Section V-A, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the contributions of each of these strategies. Though our network structure is similar to a concurrent work [31], MotionNet is fundamentally different from FlowNet2. First, we perform unsupervised learning while [31] performs supervised learning for optical flow prediction. Unsupervised learning allows us to avoid the domain gap between synthetic data and real data. Unsupervised learning also allows us to train the model for target tasks like action recognition in an end-to-end fashion even if the datasets of target applications do not have ground truth optical flow. Second, our network architecture is carefully designed to balance efficiency and accuracy. For example, MotionNet only has one network, while FlowNet2 has 5 similar sub-networks. The model footprints of MotionNet and FlowNet2 [31] are 170M and 654M, and the prediction speeds are 370fps and 25fps, respectively. We also propose several effective practices and modifications. These design differences lead to large speed and accuracy differences as will be shown. CNN Architecture Search One of our main goals in this work is a better and faster method for predicting optical flow. As we know, CNN architecture is crucial for performance and accuracy. Therefore, we explore three additional architectures with different depths and widths. There are Tiny-MotionNet, VGG16-MotionNet and ResNet50-MotionNet.\nTiny-MotionNet is a much smaller version of our proposed MotionNet. We suspect that for a low-level vision problem like optical flow estimation, we may not need a very deep network. Hence, we aggressively reduce both the width and depth of MotionNet. In the end, Tiny-MotionNet has 11 layers with a model footprint of only 8M. Details of this network can be seen in Table II.\nVGG16 [40] and ResNet50 [41] are popular network architectures from the object recognition field. We adapt them here to predict optical flow. For both networks, we keep the convolutional layers and concatenate our deconvolutional network from MotionNet to them to predict optical flow. For multi-scale skip connections, we use the last convolutional features from each convolution group. For example, we use the conv5 3, conv4 3, conv3 3, conv2 2 and conv1 1 in VGG16, and res5c, res4f, res3d, res2c and conv1 in ResNet50. All other hyper-parameters and training details are the same as MotionNet.\nFor VGG16 and ResNet50, we also investigate using their convolutional weights pre-trained on ImageNet challenges, to see whether they will serve as a good initialization. However,\n5 this achieves worse results than training from scratch due to the fact that low-level convolution layers learn completely different filters for object recognition and optical flow prediction.\nFinally, as we will show in Section V-B, the basic MotionNet as described in Figure 1 achieves the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Hence, we will use it as our proposed MotionNet architecture in the rest of this paper."

      "text" : "The conventional temporal stream is a two-stage process, where the optical flow estimation and encoding are performed separately. This two-stage approach has multiple weaknesses. It is computationally expensive, storage demanding, and suboptimal as it treats optical flow estimation and action recognition as separate tasks. Given that MotionNet and the temporal stream are both CNNs, we would like to combine these two modules into one stage and perform end-to-end training to address the aforementioned weaknesses.\nThere are multiple ways to design such a combination to project motion features to action labels. Here, we explore two ways, stacking and branching. Stacking is the most straightforward approach and just places MotionNet in front of the temporal stream, treating MotionNet as an off-theshelf flow estimator. Branching is more elegant in terms of architecture design. It uses a single network for both motion feature extraction and action classification. The convolutional features are shared between the two tasks. Stacked Temporal Stream We directly stack MotionNet in front of the temporal stream CNN, and then perform end-toend training. However, in practice, we find that determining how to do the stacking is non-trivial. The following are the main modifications we need to make. • First, we need to normalize the estimated flows before\nfeeding them to the encoding CNN. More specifically, as suggested in [10], we first clip the motions that are larger than 20 pixels to 20 pixels. Then we normalize and quantize the clipped flows to have the range between 0 ∼ 255. We find such a normalization is important for good temporal stream performance and design a new normalization layer for it. • Second, we need to determine how to fine tune the network, including which loss to use during the fine tuning. We explored different settings. (a) Fixing MotionNet, which means that we do not use the action loss to fine-tune the optical flow estimator. (b) Both MotionNet and the temporal stream CNN are fine-tuned, but only the action categorical loss function is computed. No unsupervised objective (4) is involved. (c) Both MotionNet and the temporal stream CNN are fine-tuned, and all the loss functions are computed. Since motion is largely related to action, we hope to learn better motion estimators by this multi-task way of learning. As will be demonstrated later in Section IV-C, model (c) achieves the best action recognition performance. We name it the stacked temporal stream. • Third, we need to capture relatively long-term motion dependencies. We accomplish this by inputting a stack\nShared Weights\nAction Labels\nBranched Temporal Stream Instead of learning two sets of convolutional filters, we share their weights for both tasks. The network can be seen in Figure 2. The top part is the MotionNet, while the bottom part is a traditional temporal stream. Sharing weights can be more efficient and accurate if the two tasks are closely related.\nDuring training, MotionNet is pre-trained first as above. Then we fine tune the branched temporal stream in a multitask learning manner. As for branching, we do not need to normalize the estimated flows because only the convolutional features are used for action classification. However, we still need to determine how to perform the fine tuning. We adopt model (c) with all loss functions computed. We also fix the length of our input to be 11 frames.\nAs demonstrated later in Section V-C, stacking is more promising than branching in terms of accuracy. It achieves better action recognition performance while remaining complementary to the spatial stream. Hence, we choose stacking to project the motion features to action labels from now on."

These results are important as they are strong indicators of whether our stacked temporal stream indeed learns complementary motion information or just appearance information.\nFollowing the testing scheme of [10], [11], we evenly sample 25 frames/clips for each video. For each frame/clip, we perform 10x data augmentation by cropping the 4 corners and 1 center, flipping them horizontally and averaging the prediction scores (before softmax operation) over all crops of the samples.

It contains 13, 320 video clips distributed among 101 action classes. HMDB51 includes 6, 766 video clips of 51 actions extracted from a wide range of sources, such as online videos and movies. Both UCF101 and HMDB51 have a standard threesplit evaluation protocol and we report the average recognition accuracies over the three splits.\nB. Implementation Details\nFor the CNNs, we use the Caffe toolbox [44]. For the TV-L1 optical flow, we use the OpenCV GPU implementation [11]. For all the experiments, the speed evaluation is measured on a workstation with an Intel Core I7 (4.00GHz) and an NVIDIA Titan X GPU. We have released the code and models at https: //github.com/bryanyzhu/Hidden-Two-Stream. MotionNet: Our MotionNet is trained from scratch on UCF101 with the guidance of three unsupervised objectives: the pixelwise reconstruction loss function Lpixel, the piecewise smoothness loss function Lsmooth and the region-based SSIM loss function Lssim. The generalized Charbonnier parameter α is set to 0.4 in the pixelwise reconstruction loss function, and 0.3 in the smoothness loss function.\nDuring MotionNet training, we compute the three losses five times at five different scales (five expansions). In (4), λ1 and λ3 are set to 1. λ2 is set as suggested in [20] to make sure the losses are numerically on the same order. The weights from low resolution to high resolution are empirically set to 0.16, 0.08, 0.04, 0.02 and 0.01.\nThe models are trained using Adam optimization with the default parameter values β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.999. The batch size is 16. The initial learning rate is set to 3.2× 10−5 and is divided in half every 100k iterations. We end our training at 400k iterations. Hidden two-stream networks: The hidden two-stream networks include the spatial stream and the stacked temporal stream. The MotionNet is pre-trained as above. Unless otherwise specified, the spatial model is a VGG16 CNN pretrained on ImageNet challenges [45], and the temporal model is initialized with the snapshot provided by Wang et al. [11]. We use stochastic gradient descent to train the networks, with a batch size of 128 and momentum of 0.9. We also use horizontal flipping, corner cropping and multi-scale cropping as data augmentation.\nFor the spatial stream CNN, the initial learning rate is set to 0.001, and divided by 10 every 4K iterations. We stop the training at 10K iterations. For the stacked temporal stream CNN, we set different initial learning rates for MotionNet and the temporal stream, which are 10−6 and 10−3, respectively. Then we divide the learning rates by 10 after 5K and 10K. The maximum iteration is set to 16K. The training procedure for the branched temporal stream CNN is the same as the stacked temporal stream CNN.\nFor the HMDB51 dataset, we also use the MotionNet pretrained on UCF101 without fine-tuning. For its spatial and\ntemporal stream CNNs, we initialize with the weights from UCF101 trained models."

      "heading" : "C. Results",
      "text" : "In this section, we evaluate our proposed MotionNet, the stacked temporal stream CNN, and the hidden two-stream CNNs on the first split of UCF101. We report the accuracy as well as the processing speed of the inference step in frames per second. The results are shown in Table III. Top section of Table III: Here we compare the performance of two-stage approaches. In order to compute consistent optical flow estimation for each frame, MotionNet only takes frame pairs as input. We still cache the estimated flows for training and inference for fair comparison. The results show that our MotionNet achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed at this setting.\nIn terms of accuracy, our unsupervised MotionNet is competitive to TV-L1 while performing much better (4% ∼ 12% absolute improvement) than other ways of generating flows, including supervised training using synthetic data (FlowNet [20] and FlowNet2 [31]), and directly getting flows from compressed videos (Enhanced Motion Vectors [30]). These improvements are very significant in datasets like UCF101. In terms of speed, we are also among the best of the CNN based methods and much faster than TV-L1, which is one of the fastest traditional methods.\nIt is worth noting that FlowNet2 is the state-of-the-art CNN flow estimator. It proposes several strategies like stacking multiple networks, using small displacement network, fusing large and small motion network etc. to produce accurate and sharp optical flow estimations for different scenarios. However, our MotionNet significantly surpasses the performance of FlowNet2, which indicates the effectiveness of MotionNet for action recognition. Middle section of Table III: Here we examine the performance of end-to-end CNN based approaches. None of these approaches store intermediate flow information, thus run much faster than the two-stage approaches. If we compare the\n7\naverage running time of these approaches to the two-stage ones, we can see that the time spent on writing and reading intermediate results is almost 3x as much as the time spent on all other steps. Therefore, from an efficiency perspective, it is important to do end-to-end training and predict optical flow on-the-fly.\nActionFlowNet [18] is what we denote as branched temporal stream. It is a multi-task learning model to jointly estimate optical flow and recognize actions. The convolutional features are shared which leads to faster speeds. However, even the 16 frames ActionFlowNet performs 1% worse than our stacked temporal stream. Besides, ActionFlowNet uses optical flow from traditional methods as labels to perform supervised training. This indicates that during the training phase, it still needs to cache flow estimates which is computation and storage demanding for large-scale video datasets. Also the algorithm will mimic the failure cases of the classical approaches.\nIf we compare the way we fine-tune our stacked temporal stream CNNs, we can see that model (c) where we include all the loss functions to do end-to-end training, is better than the other models including fixing MotionNet weights (model (a)) and only using the action classification loss function (model (b)). These results show that both end-to-end fine-tuning and fine-tuning with unsupervised loss functions are important for stacked temporal stream CNN training. Bottom section of Table III: Here we compare the performance of two-stream networks by fusing the prediction scores from the temporal stream CNN with the prediction scores from the spatial stream CNN. These comparisons are mainly used to show that stacked temporal stream CNNs indeed learn motion information that is complementary to what is learned in appearance streams.\nThe accuracy of the single stream spatial CNN is 80.97%. We observe from Table III that significant improvements are achieved by fusing a stacked temporal stream CNN with a spatial stream CNN to create a hidden two-stream CNN. These results show that our stacked temporal stream CNN is able to learn motion information directly from the frames and achieves much better accuracy than spatial stream CNN alone. This observation is true even in the case where we only use the action loss for fine-tuning the whole network (model (b)). This result is significant because it indicates that our unsupervised pre-training indeed finds a better path for CNNs to learn to recognize actions and this path will not be forgotten in the finetuning process. If we compare the hidden two-stream CNNs to the stacked temporal stream CNNs, we can see that the gap between model (c) and model (a)/(b) widens. The reason may be because that, without the regularization of the unsupervised loss, the networks start to learn appearance information. Hence\nthey become less complementary to the spatial CNNs. Finally, we can see that our models achieve very similar accuracy to the original two-stream CNNs. Among the two representative works we show, Two-Stream CNNs [10] is the earliest two-stream work and Very Deep Two-Stream CNNs [11] is the one we improve upon. Therefore, Very Deep TwoStream CNNs [11] is the most comparable work. We can see that our approach is about 1% worse than Very Deep TwoStream CNNs [11] in terms of accuracy but about 10x faster in terms of speed."

      "heading" : "A. Ablation Studies for MotionNet",
      "text" : "Because of our specially designed loss functions and operators, our proposed MotionNet can produce high quality motion estimation, which allows us to achieve promising action recognition accuracy. Here, we run an ablation study to understand the contributions of these components. The results are shown in Table IV. Small Disp indicates using a network that focuses on small displacements. Conv Between Deconv means adding an extra convolution between deconvolutions in the expanding part of MotionNet.\nFirst, we examine the importance of using a network structure that focuses on small displacement motions. We keep the aspects of the other implementation the same, but use a larger kernel size and stride in the beginning of the network. The accuracy drops from 82.71% to 82.22%. This drop shows that using smaller kernels with a deeper network indeed helps to detect small motions and improve our performance.\nSecond, we examine the importance of adding the SSIM loss. Without SSIM, the action recognition accuracy drops to 81.58% from 82.71%. This more than 1% performance drop shows that it is important to focus on discovering the structure\n8\nof frame pairs. Similar observations can be found in [47] for unsupervised depth estimation.\nThird, we examine the effect of removing convolutions between the deconvolutions in the expanding part of MotionNet. This strategy is designed to smooth the motion estimation [48]. As can be seen in Table IV, removing extra convolutions brings a significant performance drop from 82.71% to 81.25%.\nFourth, we examine the advantage of incorporating the smoothness objective. Without the smoothness loss, we obtain a much worse result of 80.14%. This result shows that our realworld data is very noisy. Adding smoothness regularization helps to generate smoother flow fields by suppressing noise. This suppression is important for the following temporal stream CNNs to learn better motion representations for action recognition.\nFinally, we explore a model that does not employ any of these practices. As expected, the performance is the worst, which is 4.94% lower than our full MotionNet."

      "heading" : "B. CNN Architecture Search",
      "text" : "We perform a CNN architecture search to find the best network for generating motion features for action recognition in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Here, we compare four architectures, namely Tiny-MotionNet, MotionNet, VGG16-MotionNet and ResNet50-MotionNet. These architectures all use VGG16 as the temporal stream CNNs as in [11]. The results can be seen in Table V.\nOur MotionNet achieves the highest action classification accuracy with the second smallest model size. Tiny-MotionNet is 20 times smaller than MotionNet, but its accuracy only drops 1%. It is worth noting that, even though Tiny-MotionNet is 80 times smaller than FlowNet2, it is still 1.5% more accurate. This observation is encouraging for two reasons: (1) It indicates that a very deep network might not be needed in order to generate better motion features for high-level video understanding tasks. (2) The small size of Tiny-MotionNet makes it easily fit on resource constrained devices, like mobile phones and edge devices. VGG16-MotionNet performs the worst among these four architectures. The reason is that multiple pooling layers may harm the high frequency image details which are crucial for low-level optical flow estimation. ResNet50-MotionNet achieves similar performance to our MotionNet, but is larger in terms of model size.\nWe can see that at least for generating motion features for action recognition, a very deep network is not necessary.\nIn addition, directly adapting CNN architectures for object recognition may not be optimal for dense per-pixel prediction problems. Hence, we may need to design new operators like the correlation layer [20] or novel architectures [49] to learn motions between adjacent frames in future work. The method should handle both large and small displacement, as well as fine motion boundaries."

      "heading" : "C. Stacking or Branching",
      "text" : "Here, we further study on the design choice of stacking or branching. The reason why two-stream approaches work so well is that the spatial and temporal streams explicitly model video appearance and motion in two separate networks, and are thus very complementary. With simple late fusion of the spatial and temporal streams, we can get a huge performance boost. Current state-of-the-art on the UCF101, HMDB51, ActivityNet, Sports-1M, and Kinetics datasets all adopt two-stream approaches [15], [16], [50], [51], [36], [52], [53]. Although branching might appear more elegant since it results in a simpler and more efficient network, it has worse performance. More importantly, we lose the complementarity to conventional spatial stream. The results can be seen in Table VI. “+” indicates late fusion, which is the weighted averaging of probability scores from two streams. For fair comparison, the fusion ratio is set to 1:1.5, where 1.5 is for the stream with higher accuracy. Top Section: We list the conventional spatial and temporal stream scores as in [11] for comparison. For stacked temporal stream and branched temporal stream, stacking performs better than branching. The reason is that branching requires that action classification and optical flow prediction use the same set of filters. This requirement may not be optimal in the sense that optical flow prediction and action classification are very different tasks. This statement is supported by the fact that pre-training on ImageNet does not help the optical flow prediction using MotionNet in Section III-A. We also refer to a concurrent work ActionFlowNet [18]1 to further demonstrate our conclusion because ActionFlowNet is a branched temporal stream but with a different network structure from ours. Middle Section: We combine our stacked temporal stream, branched temporal stream and ActionFlowNet with the original spatial stream. We can see that the performance gap widen. Stacking still enjoys the complementarity between\n1We thank the authors [18] for providing their experiment results.\n9 Image Overlay TV-L1 MotionNet\nappearance and motion, and obtains a significant improvement of 4.94%. However, branching learns appearance information and is thus not as complementary. Combining the branched temporal stream with the original spatial stream only gives a marginal performance improvement of 0.75%. We make a similar observation for ActionFlowNet where the improvement is 0.91%. Bottom Section: We also combine the three methods with the original temporal stream. The performance improvements are limited. For the stacked temporal stream, this limited improvement is expected because it is learning motion representations, which is the goal of the original temporal stream. These two streams are highly correlated. For the branched temporal stream and ActionFlowNet, we obtain more improvement because they learn some appearance features, which are complementary to the original temporal stream. However, both improvements are marginal.\nHence, for now, stacking is a better way to combine MotionNet and temporal stream CNNs than branching. In order to achieve faster speeds, one may use Tiny-MotionNet. The stacked temporal stream, composed of Tiny-MotionNet and VGG16 temporal stream, achieves 83.45% accuracy on the UCF101 split1 at a speed of 200fps."

      "text" : "Recall from Section II that the performance of our method can be further improved by methods that mitigate the false label assignment problem. Temporal segment networks (TSN) [15] is one such method. It addresses the false label assignment problem through jointly training the networks on several sparsely sampled frames/clips.\nAs an illustration, we replace the VGG16 architecture with TSN as our temporal stream CNN. This experiment is more of a qualitative illustration than a quantitative evaluation. Besides showing that our method can be improved by other methods, we also hope to demonstrate that the motion information generated by our MotionNet can be used by different temporal stream CNNs. Therefore, we did not fine-tune our MotionNet. Instead, we feed the predicted optical flow from MotionNet to\nTVL1 MotionNet + TV-L1 MotionNet + FlowFieldsFlowFields\nFig. 4. Visual comparisons between TV-L1 (FlowFields) with the motion estimates produced by MotionNet using TV-L1 (FlowFields) as proxy ground truth. The frame pairs are the same as in Figure 3.\nTSN for action encoding. The training and testing implementation details of TSN are the same as in [15]. The results can be seen in Table VII.\nAs we can see, although our results are slightly worse than the results of TV-L1, we enjoy significant accuracy improvements on both UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets. On UCF101 split1, we get about 3% absolute improvement. On HMDB51 split1, we get more than 5% absolute improvement. These improvements demonstrate that other approaches can be used to further improve both the speed and accuracy of our method. They also show that our motion estimation can be used by different temporal stream CNNs."

      "heading" : "E. Limitations of MotionNet",
      "text" : "Although our MotionNet outperforms other end-to-end methods [54], [31], [30], [15] for video action recognition, we are still far from exploiting its full potential and perform 1% worse than the traditional optical flow estimation method (TVL1) [24]. Here, we conduct a case by case visual comparison between the output of MotionNet and the TV-L1 algorithm, hoping to find where we could further improve our motion estimation.\nAs we can see in Figure 3, MotionNet often produces noisier motion estimates than TV-L1. In particular, MotionNet has difficulties in regions which are highly saturated or have dynamic textures, for example, water, sky, and mirrors. This difficulty is because the constant brightness assumption does not hold. For instance, in the second row of Figure 3, the true motion is shaving a beard, which is better outlined in the TV-L1 estimates. But due to the brightness change of the mirror, MotionNet mistakenly estimates motion on the upper left corner as well. Taking the third row in Figure 3 as another example, TV-L1 can produce smooth flow fields of the moving jet ski. However, the flickering effect on the water surface makes it challenging for MotionNet to understand what the real motion is.\nOverall, it seems that MotionNet is more sensitive than TVL1 in those areas where the brightness constant assumption does not hold. This phenomenon is mostly because MotionNet uses a global approach while TV-L1 uses a local approach. This phenomenon is also a potential reason that smaller kernels give us better performance. We will explore how to reduce the influence of global impact in the future.\n10"

      "heading" : "F. Will extra guidance help?",
      "text" : "Supervised optical flow learning methods [18], [23], [55], [56] show that using optical flow from traditional methods (which we call proxy ground truths) can help CNNs to learn to predict motions. Given the limitations of MotionNet, we hope to correct those failure cases by using the predictions of robust flow estimators like TV-L1 as our proxy ground truth. Therefore, we investigate whether we can learn better motion estimation if we use proxy ground truth to guide the training of our MotionNet.\nWe explore both TV-L1 [24] and FlowFields [54]. To our knowledge, TV-L1 is one of the mostly widely used and best performing flows for action recognition, and FlowFields is one of the most accurate flow estimators in the optical flow field2. The results are shown in Table VIII.\nAs can be seen, adding proxy guidance hurts performance. The action recognition accuracy drops about 2% when using TV-L1 as a proxy and 3% when using FlowFields. This result is counter-intuitive because FlowFields is often much better than TV-L1 in optical flow estimation tasks [57]. We show some qualitative results in Figure 4 to help us understand the reason behind this performance drop. As we can see, FlowFields generates much noisier optical flow than TVL1 in real-world datasets. This noise is probably because FlowFields is designed to estimate large displacement motions, which happens a lot in synthetic datasets but much less often in real-world datasets. In addition, after incorporating proxy guidance, the motion estimates look much noisier. Some motion boundaries are missing. This could be the reason for the performance drop."

We also show some visual examples to discover possible directions for future improvement.\nHere, we compare three optical flow models: TV-L1, MotionNet and FlowNet2. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of learned flow, we test the three models on the well received MPI-Sintel benchmark [57]. For action recognition accuracy,\n2For FlowFields, we use the binary kindly provided by authors in [54].\nwe report their performance on UCF101 split1. The results can be seen in Table IX.\nFlowNet2 achieves the lowest EPE on Sintel, however, it performs the worst on action recognition tasks. On the contrary, MotionNet and TV-L1 obtain much higher EPE on Sintel, but they perform quite well on UCF101. This interesting observation means that lower EPE does not always lead to higher action recognition accuracy. This is because EPE is a very simple metric based on L2 distance, which does not consider motion boundary preservation or background motion removal. This is crucial, however, for recognizing complex human actions.\nWe also show some visual samples in Figure 5 to help understand the effect of the quality of estimated flow fields for action recognition. The color scheme follows the standard flow field color coding in [31]. In general, the estimated flow fields from all three models looks reasonable. MotionNet has lots of background noise compared to TV-L1 due to its global learning. This maybe the reason why it performs worse than TV-L1 for action recognition. FlowNet2 has very crisp motion boundaries, fine structures and smoothness in homogeneous regions. It is indeed a good flow estimator in terms of both EPE and visual inspection. However, it achieves much worse results for action recognition, 3.5% lower than TV-L1 and 2.9% lower than our MotionNet. Thus, which motion representation is best for action recognition remains an open question."

We are 2.1% better on UCF101 and 10.4% better on HMDB51 than the previous state-of-the-art. This indicates that our learned motion representation is better than motion vectors [58], [30] and RGB differences [15] with respect to action recognition task. We also observe that temporal segment networks are effective practice to capture long term temporal relationship and help generate more accurate video-level prediction.\n3In general, the requirement for real-time processing is 25 fps.\n11\nIt is worth mentioning that our hidden two-stream networks with Tiny-MotionNet achieves promising performance. TinyMotionNet only has a model size of 8M and runs at a speed of more than 500fps.

      "text" : "We have proposed a new framework called hidden twostream networks to recognize human actions in video. It addresses the problem of capturing the temporal relationships among video frames which the current CNN architectures have difficulty with. Different from the current common practice of using traditional local optical flow estimation methods to pre-compute the motion information for CNNs, we use an unsupervised pre-training approach. Our motion estimation network (MotionNet) is computationally efficient and end-toend trainable. Experimental results on UCF101 and HMDB51 show that our method is 10x faster than the traditional methods while maintaining similar accuracy.\nIn the future, we would like to improve our hidden twostream networks in the following directions. First, we would improve our optical flow prediction based on the observation that the smoothness loss has significant impact on the quality of the motion estimations for action recognition. We could explore other well-designed smoothness terms like edge aware loss [47] or scale invariant gradient loss [39] to further improve the accuracy. Second, we would like to incorporate other best practices that improve the overall performance of the networks. For example, we will also perform joint training of the spatial stream CNN and the stacked temporal stream\nCNN [59] instead of a simple late fusion. Third, it would be interesting to see how addressing the false label assignment problem can help improve our overall performance. Finally, removing global camera motion and partial occlusion within the CNN framework would be helpful for both optical flow estimation and action recognition."

    "abstractText" : "Analyzing videos of human actions involves understanding the temporal relationships among video frames. CNNs are the current state-of-the-art methods for action recognition in videos. However, the CNN architectures currently being used have difficulty in capturing these relationships. State-of-the-art action recognition approaches rely on traditional local optical flow estimation methods to pre-compute motion information for CNNs. Such a two-stage approach is computationally expensive, storage demanding, and not end-to-end trainable. In this paper, we present a novel CNN architecture that implicitly captures motion information between adjacent frames. We then plug it into a state-of-the-art action recognition framework called twostream CNNs. We name our approach hidden two-stream CNNs because it only takes raw video frames as input and directly predicts action classes without explicitly computing optical flow. Our end-to-end approach is 10x faster than a two-stage one and maintains similar accuracy. Experimental results on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms previous best real-time approaches.",
