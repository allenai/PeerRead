INTRODUCTION\nThere are more than 18 million non-empty public repositories on GitHub which are not marked as forks. This makes GitHub the largest version control repository hosting service. It has become difficult to explore such a large number of projects and nearly impossible to classify them. One of the main sources of information that exists about public repositories is their code.\nTo gain a deeper understanding of software development it is important to understand the trends among open-source projects. Bleeding edge technologies are often used first in open source projects and later employed in proprietary solutions when they become stable enough1. An exploratory analysis of open-source projects can help to detect such trends and provide valuable insight for industry and academia.\nSince GitHub appeared the open-source movement has gained significant momentum. Historically developers would manually register their open-source projects in software digests. As the number of projects dramatically grew, those lists became very hard to update; as a result they became more fragmented and started exclusively specializing in narrow\n1Notable examples include the Linux OS kernel, the PostgreSQL database engine, the Apache Spark cluster-computing framework and the Docker containers.\ntechnological ecosystems. The next attempt to classify open source projects was based on manually submitted lists of keywords. While this approach works [1], it requires careful keywords engineering to appear comprehensive, and thus not widely adopted by the end users in practice. GitHub introduced repository tags in January 2017 which is a variant of manual keywords submission.\nThe present paper describes how to conduct fully automated topic extraction from millions of public repositories. It scales linearly with the overall source code size and has substantial performance reserve to support the future growth. We propose building a bag-of-words model on names occurring in source code and applying proven Natural Language Processing algorithms to it. Particularly, we describe how ”Weighted MinHash” algorithm [2] helps to filter fuzzy duplicates and how an Additive Regularized Topic Model (ARTM) [3] can be efficiently trained. The result of the topic modeling is a nearly-complete open source projects classification. It reflects the drastic variety in open source projects and reflect multiple features. The dataset we work with consists of approx. 18 million public repositories retrieved from GitHub in October 2016.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section II reviews prior work on the subject. Section III elaborates on how we turn software repositories into bags-of-words. Section IV describes the approach to efficient filtering of fuzzy repository clones. Section V covers the building of the ARTM model with 256 manually labeled topics. Section VI presents the achieved topic modeling results. Section VII lists the opened datasets we were able to prepare. Finally, section VIII presents a conclusion and suggests improvements to future work."

      "text" : "There was an open source community study which presented statistics about manually picked topics in 2005 by J. Xu et.al. [4].\nBlincoe et.al. [5] studied GitHub ecosystems using reference coupling over the GHTorrent dataset [6] which contained 2.4 million projects. This research employs an alternative topic modeling method on source code of 13.6 million projects.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 13\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.P L\n] 1\nA pr\n2 01\n7\nInstead of using the GHTorrent dataset we’ve prepared open datasets from almost all public repositories on GitHub to be able to have a more comprehensive overview.\nM. Lungi [7] conducted an in-depth study of software ecosystems in 2009, the year when GitHub appeared. The examples in this work used samples of approx. 10 repositories. And the proposed discovery methods did not include Natural Language Processing.\nThe problem of the correct analysis of forks on GitHub has been discussed by Kalliamvakou et.al. [8] along with other valuable concerns.\nTopic modeling of source code has been applied to a variety of problems reviewed in [9]: improvement of software maintenance [10], [11], defects explanation [12], concept analysis [13], [14], software evolution analysis [15], [16], finding similarities and clones [17], clustering source code and discovering the internal structure [18], [19], [20], summarizing [21], [22], [23]. In the aforementioned works, the scope of the research was focused on individual projects.\nThe usage of topic modeling [24] focused on improving software maintenance and was evaluated on 4 software projects. Concepts were extracted using a corpus of 24 projects in [25]. Giriprasad Sridhara et.al. [26], Yang and Tan [27], Howard et.al. [28] considered comments and/or names to find semantically similar terms; Haiduc and Marcus [29] researched common domain terms appearing in source code. The presented approach in this papers reveals similar and domain terms, but leverages a much significantly larger dataset of 13.6 million repositories.\nBajracharya and Lopes [30] trained a topic model on the year long usage log of Koders, one of the major commercial code search engines. The topic categories suggested by Bajracharya and Lopes share little similarity with the categories described in this paper since the input domain is much different.\nB. Industry\nTo our knowledge, there are few companies which maintain a complete mirror of GitHub repositories. source{d} [31] is focused on doing machine learning on top of the collected source code. Software Heritage [32] strives to become web.archive.org for open source software. SourceGraph [33] processes source code references, internal and external, and created a complete reference graph for projects written in Golang.\nlibraries.io [34] is not GitHub centric but rather processes the dependencies and metadata of open source packages fetched from a number of repositories. It analyses the dependency graph (at the level of projects, while SourceGraph analyses at the level of functions)."

And treat each repository as a single document. An improvement for further research would be to use the entire history of each repository including unique code found in each branch."

      "heading" : "A. Preliminary Processing",
      "text" : "Our first goal is to process each repository to identify which files contain source code, and which files are redundant for our purpose. GitHub has an open-source machine learning based library named linguist [35] that identifies the programming language used within a file based on its extension and contents. We modified it to also identify vendor code and automatically generated files. The first step in our preprocessing is to run linguist over each repository’s master branch. From 11.94 million repositories we end up with 402.6 million source files in which we have high confidence it is source code written by a developer in that project. Identifying the programming language used within each file is important for the next step, the names extraction, as it determines the programming language parser."

      "text" : "Source code highlighting is a typical task for professional text editors and IDE’s. There have been several open source libraries created to tackle this task. Each works by having a grammar file written per programming language which contains the rules. Pygments [36] is a high quality communitydriven package for Python which supports more than 400 programming languages and markups. According to Pygments, all source code tokens are classified across the following categories: comments, escapes, indentations and generic symbols, reserved keywords, literals, operators, punctuation and names.\nLinguist and Pygments have different sets of supported languages. Linguist stores it’s list at master/lib/linguist/languages.yml and the similar Pygments list is stored as pygments.lexers.LEXERS. Each has nearly 400 items and the intersection is approximately 200 programming languages (”programming” Linguist’s item type). The languages common to Linguist and Pygments which were chosen are listed in appendix A. In this research we apply Pygments to the 402.6 million source files to extract all tokens which belong to the type Token.Name."

As an example class FooBarBaz adds three words to the bag: foo, bar and baz, or int wdSize should add two: wdsize and size. Fig. 1 is the full listing of the function written in Python 3.4+ which splits identifiers.\nIn this step each repository is saved as an sqlite database file which contains a table with: programming language, name extracted and frequency of occurance in that repository. The total number of unique names that were extracted were 17.28 million."

      "heading" : "D. Stemming names",
      "text" : "It is common to stem names when creating a bag-of-words in NLP. Since we are working with natural language that is predominantly English we have applied the Snowball stemmer [37] from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [38]. The stemmer was applied to names which were >6 characters long. In further research a diligent step would be to compare results with and without stemming of the names, and also to predetermine the language of the name (when available) and apply stemmers in different languages.\nThe length of words on which stemming was applied was chosen after the manual observation that shorter identifiers tend to collide with each other when stemmed and longer identifiers need to be normalized. Fig. 2 represents the distribution of identifier lengths in the dataset:\nIt can be seen that the most common name length is 6. Fig. 3 is the plot of the number of unique words in the dataset depending on the stemming threshold:\nWe observe the breaking point at length 5. The vocabulary size linearly grows starting with length 6. Having manually inspected several collisions on smaller thresholds, we came to\nthe conclusion that 6 corresponds to the best trade-off between collisions and word normalization.\nThe Snowball algorithm was chosen based on the comparative study by Jivani [39]. Stems not being real words are acceptable but it is critical to have minimum over-stemming since it increases the number of collisions. The total number of unique names are 16.06 million after stemming.\nTo be able to efficiently pre-process our data we used Apache Spark [40] running on 64 4-core nodes which allowed us to process repositories in parallel in less than 1 day.\nHowever, before training a topic model one has to exclude near-duplicate repositories. In many cases GitHub users include the source code of existing projects without preserving the commit history. For example, it is common for web sites, blogs and Linux-based firmwares. Those repositories contain very little original changes and may introduce frequency noise into the overall names distribution. This paper suggests the\nway to filter the described fuzzy duplicates based on the bag of words model built on the names in the source code."

      "heading" : "IV. FILTERING NEAR-DUPLICATE REPOSITORIES",
      "text" : "There were more than 70 million GitHub repositories in October 2016 by our estimation. Approx. 18 million were not marked as forks. Nearly 800,000 repositories were de facto forks but not marked correspondingly by GitHub. That is, they had the same git commit history with colliding hashes. Such repositories may appear when a user pushes a cloned or imported repository under his or her own account without using the GitHub web interface to initiate a fork.\nWhen we remove such hidden forks from the initial 18 million repositories, there still remain repositories which are highly similar. A duplicate repository is sometimes the result of a git push of an existing project with a small number of changes. For example, there are a large number of repositories with the Linux kernel which are ports to specific devices. In another case, repositories containing web sites were created using a cloned web engine and preserving the development history. Finally, a large number of github.io repositories are the same. Such repositories contain much text content and few identifiers which are typically the same (HTML tags, CSS rules, etc.).\nFiltering out such fuzzy forks speeds up the future training of the topic model and reduces the noise. As we obtained a bag-of-words for every repository, the naive approach would be to measure all pairwise similarities and find cliques. But first we need to define what is the similarity between bags-ofwords."

      "heading" : "A. Weighted MinHash",
      "text" : "Suppose that we have two dictionaries - key-value mappings with unique keys and values indicating non-negative ”weights” of the corresponding keys. We would like to introduce a similarity measure between them. The Jaccard Similarity between dictionaries A = {i : ai}, i ∈ I and B = {j : bj}, j ∈ J is defined as\nJ =\n∑ k∈K\nmin(ak, bk)∑ k∈K max(ak, bk) ,K = I ∪ J (1)\nwhere ak = 0, k /∈ I and bk = 0, k /∈ J . If the weights are binary, this formula is equivalent to the common Jaccard Similarity definition.\nThe same way as MinHash is the algorithm to find similar sets in linear time, Weighted MinHash is the algorithm to find similar dictionaries in linear time. Weighted MinHash was introduced by Ioffe in [2]. We have chosen it in this paper because it is very efficient and allows execution on GPUs instead of large CPU clusters. The proposed algorithm depends on the parameter K which adjusts the resulting hash length.\n1. for k in range(K): 1.1. Sample rk, ck ∼ Gamma(2, 1) - Gamma distri-\nbution (their PDF is P (r) = re−r), and βk ∼ Uniform(0, 1).\n1.2. Compute\ntk = b lnSk rk + βkc (2) yk = e rk(tk−βk) (3) zk = yke rk (4) ak = ck zk (5)\n2. Find k∗ = arg mink ak and return the samples (k∗, tk∗). Thus given K and supposing that the integers are 32- bit we obtain the hash with size 8K bytes. Samples from Gamma(2, 1) distribution can be efficiently calculated as r = − ln(u1u2) where u1, u2 ∼ Uniform(0, 1) - uniform distribution between 0 and 1.\nWe developed the MinHashCUDA [41] library and Python native extension which is the implementation of Weighted MinHash algorithm for NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA [42]. There were several engineering challenges with that implementation which are unfortunately out of the scope of this paper. We were able to hash all 10 million repositories with hash size equal to 128 in less than 5 minutes using MinHashCUDA and 2 NVIDIA Titan X Pascal GPU cards."

      "heading" : "B. Locality Sensitive Hashing",
      "text" : "Having calculated all the hashes in the dataset, we can perform Locality Sensitive Hashing. We define several hash tables, each for it’s own sub-hash which depends on the target level of false positives. Same elements will appear in the same bucket; union of the bucket sets across all the hash tables for a specific sample yields all the similar samples. Since our goal is to determine the sets of mutually similar samples, we should consider the set intersection instead.\nWe used the implementation of Weighted MinHash LSH from Datasketch [43]. It is designed after the corresponding algorithm in Mining of Massive Datasets [44]. LSH takes a single parameter - the target Weighted Jaccard Similarity value (”threshold”). MinHash LSH puts every repository in a number of separate hash tables which depend on the threshold and the hash size. We used the default threshold 0.9 in our experiments which ensures a low level of dissimilarity within a hash table bin.\nAlgorithm 5 describes the fuzzy duplicates detection pipeline. Step 6 discards less than 0.5% of all the sets and aims at reducing the number of false positives. The bins size distribution after step 5 is depicted on Fig. 4 - it is clearly seen that the majority of the bins has the size 2. Step 6 uses Weighted Jaccard similarity threshold 0.8 instead of 0.9 to be sensitive to evident outliers exclusively.\nTable I reveals how different hash sizes influence on the resulting number of fuzzy clones:\nAlgorithm 5 results in approximately 467,000 sets of fuzzy duplicates with overall 1.7 million unique repositories. Each repository appears in two sets on average. The examples of fuzzy duplicates are listed in appendix B. The detection algorithm works especially well for static web sites which share the same JavaScript libraries.\nAfter the exclusion of the fuzzy duplicates, we finish dataset processing and pass over to training of the topic model. The total number of unique names has now reduced by 2.06 million to 14 million unique names. To build a meaningful dataset, names with occurrence of less than Tf = 20 were excluded from the final vocabulary. 20 was chosen on the frequency histogram shown on Fig. 6 since it is the drop-off point.\nAfter this exclusion, there are now 2 million unique names,\nwith an average size of a bag-of-words of 285 per repository and Fig. 7 displays the heavy-tailed bag size distribution."

(6)\nHere p(w|t) is the probability of the term w to belong to the topic t, p(t|d) is the probability of the topic t to belong to the document d, thus the whole formula is just an expression of the total probability, accepting the hypothesis of conditional independence: p(w|d, t) = p(w|t). Terms belong to the vocabulary W , topics are taken from the set T which is simply the series of indices [1, 2, . . . nt].\nWe’d like to solve the problem of recovering p(w|t) and p(t|d) from the given set of documents {d ∈ D : d = {w1 . . . wnd}}. We normally assume p̂(w|d) = ndwnd , ndw being the number of times term w occurred in document d, but this implies that all the terms are equally important which is not always true. ”Importance” here means some measure which negatively correlates with the overall frequency of the term. Let us denote the recovered probabilities as p̂(w|t) = φwt and p̂(t|d) = θtd. Thus our problem is the stochastic matrix decomposition which is not correctly stated:\nndw nd ≈ Φ ·Θ = (ΦS)(S−1Θ) = Φ′ ·Θ′. (7)\nThe stated problem can be solved by applying maximum likelihood estimation:∑\nd∈D ∑ w∈d ndw ln ∑ t φwtθtd → max Φ,Θ\n(8)\nupon the conditions\nφwt > 0; ∑ w∈W φwt = 1; θtd > 0; ∑ t∈T θtd = 1. (9)\nThe idea of ARTM is to naturally introduce regularization as one or several extra additive members:∑\nd∈D ∑ w∈d ndw ln ∑ t φwtθtd +R(Φ,Θ)→ max Φ,Θ . (10)\nSince this is a simple summation, one can combine a series of regularizers in the same objective function. For example, it is possible to increase Φ and Θ sparsity or to make topics less correlated. Well-known LDA model [45] can be reproduced as ARTM too.\nThe variables Φ and Θ can be effectively calculated using the iterative expectation maximization algorithm [46]. Many ready to be used ARTM regularizers are already implemented in the BigARTM open source project [47]."

      "heading" : "B. Training",
      "text" : "Vorontsov shows in [3] that ARTM is trained best if the regularizers are activated sequentially, with a lag relative to each other. For example, first EM iterations are performed without any regularizers at all and the model reaches target perplexity, then Φ and Θ sparsity regularizers are activated and the model optimizes for those new members in the objective function while not increasing the perplexity. Finally other advanced regularizers are appended and the model minimizes the corresponding members while leaving the old ones intact.\nWe apply only Φ and Θ sparsity regularizers in this paper. Further research is required to leverage others. We\nexperimented with the training of ARTM on the source code identifiers from III and observed that the final perplexity and sparsity values do not change considerably on the wide range of adjustable meta-parameters. The best training metaparameters are given in Table II.\nWe chose 256 topics merely because it is time intensive to label them and 256 was the largest amount we could label. The traditional ways of determining the optimal number of topics using e.g. Elbow curves are not applicable to our data. We cannot consider topics as clusters since a typical repository corresponds to several topics and increasing the number of topics worsens the model’s generalization and requires the dedicated topics decorrelation regularizer. The overall number of iterations equals 18. The convergence plot is shown on Fig. 8.\nThe achieved quality metric values are as given in Table III. On the average, a single iteration took 40 minutes to complete on our hardware. We used BigARTM in a Linux environment on 16-core (32 threads) Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v4 computer with 256 GB of RAM. BigARTM supports the parallel training and we set the number of workers\nto 30. The peak memory usage was approximately 32 GB. It is possible to relax the hardware requirements and speed up the training if the model size is reduced. If we set the frequency threshold Tf to a greater value, we can dramatically reduce the input data size with the risk of loosing the ability of the model to generalize."

It is possible to interpret some topics based on the most significant words, some based on relevant repositories, but many require manual supervision with the careful analysis of most relevant names and repositories. This supervision is labour intensive and the single topic normally takes up to 30 minutes to summarize with proper confidence. 256 topics required several man-days to complete the analysis.\nAfter a careful analysis, we sorted the labelled topics into the following groups: • Concepts (41) - general, broad and abstract. The most\ninteresting group. It includes scientific terms, facts about the world and the society.\n• Human languages (10) - it appeared that one can determine programmer’s approximate native language looking at his code, thanks to the stem bias. • Programming languages (33) - not so interesting since this is the information we already have after linguist classification. Programming languages usually have a standard library of classes and functions which is imported/included into most of the programs, and the corresponding names are revealed by our topic modeling. Some topics are more narrow than a programming language. • General IT (72) - the topics which could appear in Concepts if had an expressive list of key words but do not. The repositories are associated by the unique set of names in the code without any special meaning. • Technologies (87) - devoted to some specific, potentially narrow technology or product. Often indicates an ecosystem or community around the technology. • Games (13) - related to video games. Includes specific gaming engines.\nThe complete topics list is in appendix C. The example topic labelled ”Machine Learning, Data Science” is shown in appendix D.\nIt can be observed that some topics are dual and need to be splitted. That duality is a sign that the number of topics should be bigger. At the same time, some topics appear twice and need to be de-correlated, e.g. using the ”decorrelation” ARTM regularizer. Simple reduction or increase of the number of topics however do not solve those problems, we found it out while experimenting with 200 and 320 topics."

However, programmers have a rich use of natural language within their code through comments, text literals and naming entities. The programmer defined names that can be found in source code are a rich source of information to build a high level understanding of the project. The goal of this paper is to apply topic modeling to names used in over 13.6 million repositories and perceive the inferred topics. One of the problems in such a study is the occurrence of duplicate repositories not officially marked as forks (obscure forks). We show how to address it using the same identifiers which are extracted for topic modeling. We open with a discussion on naming in source code, we then elaborate on our approach to remove exact duplicate and fuzzy duplicate repositories using Locality Sensitive Hashing on the bag-of-words model and then discuss our work on topic modeling; and finally present the results from our data analysis together with open-access to the source code, tools and datasets.",
