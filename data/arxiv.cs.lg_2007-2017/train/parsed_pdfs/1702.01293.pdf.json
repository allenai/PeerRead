      "text" : "Many real binary classification problems involve imbalanced classes, for example object detection in vision and fraud detection in security. In such problems it is easy to collect background data, while data representing the target class is rare or hard (expensive) to obtain. The majority of existing powerful classifiers (e.g., SVM, Neural Networks, including deep ones) assume balanced training sets and when trained on imbalanced sets show degraded classification performance.\nDeep Neural Networks have recently shown very impressive performance in large-scale multi-class problems [14, 25, 23, 24]. However, these models require very large\nnumber of labeled training samples and their performance drops rapidly when the training set size gets smaller. Note that the requirement of large labeled sets is expensive in terms of data collection and training time. In practice, many learning problems require rapid inference from small amounts of data.\nThe aim of this work is to develop powerful and fast classifiers that improve in both tasks: 1) training in imbalanced setting that involve a small number of positive training samples and a large number of negative data points; 2) multiclass problems with a small number of labeled samples.\nWe follow the paradigm introduced in [20] that combines hinge risk for the smaller class and minimax risk [16, 10] for the larger class to address imbalanced classification problems. The mixed risk was used to train linear and kernel hybrid classifiers in [20]. Unfortunately, while being well understood and fast, linear classifiers do not solve all machine learning problems. Kernel methods show good classification results for highly non-linear problems, but they suffer from long running time and are not scalable to large tasks. To address these issues, [19] derived a hinge-minimax risk and an efficient training algorithm for intersection ofK positive halfspaces. Such an intersection forms a convex set which limits the applicability of the classifier.\nIn this work, we generalize the hinge-minimax risk for an ensemble of linear classifiers, that can form arbitrary, piece-wise linear boundaries. We propose a training algorithm that minimizes this risk by simultaneously discovering the convex components in the positive class and building K-hyperplane models to separate each component from the negative class. The learning is done by alternating between finding the best partition of the data into hidden components and updating the model over this partition. We call our novel classifier the Latent Hinge Minimax (LHM) classifier, as it discovers the latent structure in the data and employs the Hinge-Minimax paradigm.\nWe show that in imbalanced setting the proposed LHM classifier outperforms other combinations of hyperplanes, including Neural Network (NN) with an equivalent architecture (NN can be viewed as a combination of hyper-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n01 29\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nF eb\n2 01\nplanes). The robustness of LHM to imbalanced problems can be explained by the use of the minimax risk [16, 10], that serves as a regularizer in training (since it utilizes the statistics of the entire class, as opposed to learning from small batches of examples).\nThe LHM training procedure is designed for binary problems. To apply it in a multi-class setting, we build one-against-all classifiers for all classes and combine them in a single model by mapping class specific LHM models to a multi-class NN with a matching architecture (see Section 4.2). We then use the cross-entropy loss to adjust the weights in the resulting LHM-NN combination.\nTo solve classification problems with a small number of training examples, it was suggested (e.g.,[5, 7, 17]) to combine a pre-trained CNN (trained on a much larger training set for a related classification problem) for feature extraction, with a classifier for the target problem. Such an approach was also referred to as transfer learning. If the classifier is implemented as a neural network, it enables an end-to-end training, which usually improves the results. We show that using LHM-NN in the transfer learning settings has significant benefits compared to NN, in both classification accuracy and training efficiency. The improved accuracy stems from the ability of LHM model to learn from unlabeled data. The fast convergence of the LHM-NN (just a handful of epochs) is due to a very good initialization of the upper layers with class specific LHM classifiers. Note that class specific LHM models can be trained in parallel while a distributed training of fully connected layers in NN is far from being trivial. Moreover, adding a new class to LHM-NN is fast and easy: train a classifier for the new class, map it to the corresponding LHM-NN architecture and run a very fast fine-tuning. Similarly to [15], which considered the transfer learning for the n+ 1 category from a fully trained n-category classifier, we use only a handful of training samples for tuning it. In contrast to [15], we do not restrict the new classifier to belong to the span of the previously learned n classifiers. This allows us greater flexibility in adding a new, non-related class to the multi-class model.\nThe method proposed here is different from the one-shot learning approach [12, 22], which attempts to find a mapping between target and source examples and apply it to the examples or to the model. LHM classifier learns the target concept from its examples, leveraging from unlabeled data in modeling the background statistics."

      "text" : "We first address the settings in which the positive labeled class is much smaller then the negative class. It was shown that hinge loss [26, 29, 1, 2, 11] is computationally appealing when there are fairly small number of training samples, thus it could be used to measure the positive class\nrisk within imbalanced problem settings. Alternatively, the minimax risk [16, 10] upper bounds the distribution that generates the instances-labels examples in the world. This approach is computationally appealing when there are (infinitely) many training examples, since it only utilizes their statistical properties, such as mean and covariance. Consequently, it could be employed as the negative class risk.\nIn this work we derive a mixed risk and an efficient training algorithm for a more general ensemble of hyperplanes. Our approach builds upon the mixed risk for the intersection of K-hyperplanes [19] which is briefly summarized in section 2.1."

      "text" : "The training aims to minimize the empirical risk in Eq. 6 over the parameters WLHM and the hidden variables ϕ. Similarly to latent SVM [28], the complexity of the optimal assignment of samples to latent components is exponential. We propose an iterative algorithm, which reaches fast convergence and shows good results in practice. The algorithm iterates between two steps: First, given an assignment it produces a model WLHM , second, it updates the latent variables ϕ(x),∀x ∈ X+ to better represent the latent structure of the data.\nThe first step updates the LHM model W tLHM in iteration t given the latent variables ϕ from iteration t − 1. Namely, for each hidden component i = 1, ..., C, we find the hyperplanes W i separating the training samples in Xi from Dneg by minimizing the empirical risk in Eq. 5. This risk is minimized by the training algorithm proposed in [19].\nThe second step updates the latent variable assignment, given the current W tLHM . For each positive sample, it finds the best component w.r.t. the risk in Eq 6. Specifically, the hinge risk for x is simply `(W i, x, 1). The minimax part of the assignment function for x /∈ Qi should consider the probability that this point adds when it is included in the component i (as shown in Figure 1, left). For x ∈ Qi, the minimax part should consider the amount of probability released when the component shrinks as a result of change in\nthe assignment of x (as shown in Figure 1, right). The optimal assignment should take both cases into consideration for all components. We define the assignment as follows,\nϕ(x) = (7)\nargmin i∈{1..C}\n[ Pr\nz∼Z(µ̂,Σ̂) (z ∈ Qix) + λ`(W i;x, 1)\n]\nwhere Qix , {x : W ix T x ≥ ~0} and\nW ix , { W def if x ∈ Q W inf if x /∈ Q\nW def is a deflated model derived fromW i by parallel translation of the hyperplane closest to x such thatwT∗ x+b∗ = 0.

Algorithm 1 minimizes the empirical risk L(WLHM ;ϕ).\nProof. Since LHM risk is a sum of risks over the latent components (Eq. 6), it is minimized by minimizing the empirical risk of each component. In step (5) of the Algorithm 1, we train W i,t model for each latent component i = 1, ..., C using the iterative algorithm from [19] (the convergence of which was shown in [19]). It is easy to see that L(W i) = L(WKHHM ), thus step (5) of the Algorithm 1 minimizes the component’s risk in Eq. 5.\nIt is now left to show that the assignment ϕt in iteration t, will cause the reduction in the empirical risk in iteration t + 1. Since the empirical risk is aggregated over positive samples, it is enough to prove the claim for a single sample. We consider two cases: 1. The assignment of sample x does not change, formally ϕt(x) = ϕt+1(x). In this case L(W t+1LHM ;ϕ\nt+1(x)) will only be affected by the W i,t+1 training, thus\nL ( W tLHM ;ϕ t(x) ) ≥ L ( W t+1LHM ;ϕ t+1(x) )\n2. The assignment of sample x is changed. Formally in iteration t: ϕt(x) = i and in interation t + 1 exists j 6= i, such that\nϕt+1(x) = j = argmin k∈{1..C}\nLMX - ( W k,tx ) + λLHX+ ( W k,t;x ) .\nSince x ∈ Qi, reassigning it to a different component will cause the Prz∼Z(µ̂,Σ̂)(z ∈ Qix) to decrease (or stay the same), thus\nLMX - (W i,t x )− LMX - (W i,t) ≤ 0.\nHence, the sample loss in component i is larger than the sample loss in the deflated component:\nL ( W i,t;x ) ≥ LMX - ( W i,tx ) + λLHX+ ( W i,t;x ) . (8)\nAt the same time, j is the optimal assignment, thus LMX - ( W i,tx ) + λLHX+ ( W i,t;x ) ≥ (9)\nLMX - ( W j,tx ) + λLHX+ ( W j,t;x ) .\nSince W j,tx is a naive inflation of W j,t to include x, the solution W j,t+1, provided by KHHM training, would have lower (or same) empirical risk, thus\nLMX - ( W j,tx ) ≥ LMX - (W j,t+1). (10)\nIn iteration t + 1, x is included in Xj for training the j’th latent component, consequently\nLHX+ ( W j,t;x ) ≥ LHX+ (W j,t+1;x). (11)\n(as we assume that x ∈ Xj leads to x ∈ Qj,t+1).

The second setting refers to the worst case scenario for the transfer learning where the source and the target classification problems share very little similarity.

Since the probability of the negative class is evaluated inside the positive region using false positives [19], the number of which drops very fast, the estimation time of the mean and covariance during the training is negligible. Training of a binary classifier per class is independent of other classes, thus their training can be done in parallel. Finally, the fine-tuning of the multi-class network after mapping is very fast, due to the initialization of all layers (using supervized learning): feature extraction layers with pre-trained CNN and classifier’s layers with LHM models.\nThe LHM-NN is also beneficial for the problems in which classes are dynamically added or removed from the classification task. Adding a class requires training a single binary classifier and fast fine-tuning; removing a class requires only fine-tuning."

      "text" : "We proposed a novel Latent Hinge-Minimax classifier for binary problems that discovers the hidden components in the positive class and separates them from the negative class with the intersections of positive half spaces. The main advantage of this classifier is its ability to incorporate unlabeled data in training. This results in a better robustness to imbalanced problems. We showed that for multiclass tasks, class-specific LHM models can be mapped to a multi-class NN with matching architecture requiring only a few iterations of fine-tuning. Finally, the proposed LHM architecture can be integrated with CNN features via transfer learning. The entire training procedure is very efficient. Our experiments showed that such classifiers are much more robust to the number of labeled training samples than the equivalent NNs.\nWe plan to incorporate multi-class loss into the HingeMinimax paradigm and design an efficient algorithm for minimizing this risk. We also plan to tain NNs using HingeMinimax like loss. It would be interesting to compare the results of this model with the binary-to-multiclass mapping scheme proposed here."

    "abstractText" : "Deep Learning (DL) methods show very good performance when trained on large, balanced data sets. However, many practical problems involve imbalanced data sets, or/and classes with a small number of training samples. The performance of DL methods as well as more traditional classifiers drops significantly in such settings. Most of the existing solutions for imbalanced problems focus on customizing the data for training. A more principled solution is to use mixed Hinge-Minimax risk [19] specifically designed to solve binary problems with imbalanced training sets. Here we propose a Latent Hinge Minimax (LHM) risk and a training algorithm that generalizes this paradigm to an ensemble of hyperplanes that can form arbitrary complex, piecewise linear boundaries. To extract good features, we combine LHM model with CNN via transfer learning. To solve multi-class problem we map pre-trained categoryspecific LHM classifiers to a multi-class neural network and adjust the weights with very fast tuning. LHM classifier enables the use of unlabeled data in its training and the mapping allows for multi-class inference, resulting in a classifier that performs better than alternatives when trained on a small number of training samples.",
