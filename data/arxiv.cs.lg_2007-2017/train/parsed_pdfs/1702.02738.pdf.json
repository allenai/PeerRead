      "text" : "Many of our activities involve changes in object states. We need to open a book to read it, to cut bread before eating it and to lighten candles before taking out a birthday cake. Transitions of object states are often coupled with particular manipulation actions (open, cut, lighten). Moreover, the success of an action is often signified by reaching the desired state of an object (whipped cream, ironed shirt) and avoiding other states (burned shirt). Recognizing object states and manipulation actions is, hence, expected to become a key component of future systems such as wearable automatic assistants or home robots helping people in their daily tasks.\nHuman visual system can easily distinguish different states of objects, such as open/closed bottle or full/empty coffee cup [7]. Automatic recognition of object states and\n∗Département dinformatique de l’ENS, École normale supérieure, CNRS, PSL Research University, 75005 Paris, France. †INRIA ‡Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at the Czech Technical University in Prague. §Department of CS & OR (DIRO), Université de Montréal, Montréal.\nstate changes, however, presents challenges as it requires distinguishing subtle changes in object appearance such as the presence of a cap on the bottle or screws on the car tire. Despite much work on object recognition and localization, recognition of object states has received only limited attention in computer vision [21].\nOne solution to recognizing object states would be to manually annotate states for different objects, and treat the problem as a supervised fine-grained object classification task [13, 14]. This approach, however, presents two problems. First, we would have to decide a priori on the set of state labels for each object, which can be ambiguous and not suitable for future tasks. Second, for each label we would need to collect a large number of examples, which can be very costly.\nIn this paper we propose to discover object states directly from videos with object manipulations. As state changes are often caused by specific actions, we attempt to jointly discover object states and corresponding manipulations. In our setup we assume that two distinct object states are temporally separated by a manipulation action. For example, the empty and full states of a coffee cup are separated by the “pouring coffee” action, as shown in Figure 1. Equipped with this constraint, we develop a clustering approach that\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n02 73\n8v 3\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n8 A\nug 2\n01 7\njointly (i) groups object states with similar appearance and consistent temporal locations with respect to the action and (ii) finds similar manipulation actions separating those object states in the input videos. Our approach exploits the complementarity of both subproblems and finds a joint solution for states and actions. We formulate our problem by adopting a discriminative clustering loss [3] and a joint consistency cost between states and actions. We introduce an effective optimization solution in order to handle the resulting non-convex loss function and the set of spatial-temporal constraints. To evaluate our method, we collect a new video dataset depicting real-life object manipulation actions in realistic videos. Given this dataset for training, our method demonstrates successful discovery of object states and manipulation actions. We also demonstrate that our joint formulation gives an improvement of object state discovery by action recognition and vice versa."

      "text" : "Below we review related work on person-object interaction, recognizing object states, action recognition and discriminative clustering that we employ in our model. Person-object interactions. Many daily activities involve person-object interactions. Modeling co-occurrences of objects and actions have shown benefits for recognizing actions in [10, 18, 25, 34, 46]. Recent work has also focused on building realistic datasets with people manipulating objects, e.g. in instructional videos [2, 31, 36] or while performing daily activities [37]. We build on this work but focus on joint modeling and recognition of actions and object states. States of objects. Prior work has addressed recognition of object attributes [14, 32, 33], which can be seen as different object states in some cases. Differently from our approach, these works typically focus on classifying still images, do not consider human actions and assume an a priori known list of possible attributes. Closer to our setting, Isola et al. [21] discover object states and transformations between them by analyzing large collections of still images downloaded from the Internet. In contrast, our method does not require annotations of object states. Instead, we use the dynamics of consistent manipulations to discover object states in the video with minimal supervision. In [9], the authors use consistent manipulations to discover task relevant objects. However, they do not consider object states, rely mostly on first person cues (such as gaze) and take advantage of the fact that videos are taken in a single controlled environment. Action recognition. Most of the prior work on action recognition has focused on designing features to describe time intervals of a video using motion and appearance [29, 38, 42, 43]. This is effective for actions such as dancing or jumping, however, many of our daily activities are best\ndistinguishable by their effect on the environment. For example, opening door and closing door can look very similar using only motion and appearance descriptors but their outcome is completely different. This observation has been used to design action models in [15, 16, 44]. In [44], for example, the authors propose to learn an embedding in which a given action acts as a transformation of features of the video. In our work we localize objects and recognize changes of their states using manipulation actions as a supervisory signal. Related to ours is also the work of Fathi et al. [15] who represent actions in egocentric videos by changes of appearance of objects (also called object states), however, their method requires manually annotated precise temporal localization of actions in training videos. In contrast, we focus on (non-egocentric) Internet videos depicting real-life object manipulations where actions are performed by different people in a variety of challenging indoor/outdoor environments. In addition, our model jointly learns to recognize both actions and object states with only minimal supervision. Discriminative clustering. Our model builds on unsupervised discriminative clustering methods [3, 40, 45] that group data samples according to a simultaneously learned classifier. Such methods can incorporate (weak) supervision that helps to steer the clustering towards a preferred solution [4, 12, 20, 23, 41]. In particular, we build on the discriminative clustering approach of [3] that has been shown to perform well in a variety of computer vision problems [4]. It leads to a quadratic optimization problem where different forms of supervision can be incorporated in the form of (typically) linear constraints. Building on this formalism, we develop a model that jointly finds object states and temporal locations of actions in the video. Part of our object state model is related to [24], while our action model is related to [6]. However, we introduce new spatialtemporal constraints together with a novel joint cost function linking object states and actions, as well as new effective optimization techniques. Contributions. The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we develop a new discriminative clustering model that jointly discovers object states and temporally localizes associated manipulation actions in video. Second, we introduce an effective optimization algorithm to handle the resulting non-convex constrained optimization problem. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that our model discovers key object states and manipulation actions from input videos with minimal supervision."

We also assume that we are given an a priori model of the corresponding object in the form of a pre-trained ob-\nject detector [17]. Given these inputs, our goal is twofold: (i) localize the temporal extent of the action and (ii) spatially/temporally localize the manipulated object and identify its states over time. This is achieved by jointly clustering the appearances of an object (such as an “oyster”) appearing in all clips into two classes, corresponding to the two different states (such as “closed” and “open”), while at the same time temporally localizing a consistent “opening” action that separates the two states consistently in all clips.

To address the first goal, we employ pre-trained object detectors. To address the second goal, we formulate the discovery of object states as a discriminative clustering task with constraints. We obtain candidate object detections using standard object detectors pre-trained on large scale existing datasets such as ImageNet [11]. We assume that each clip n is accompanied with a set of Mn tracklets1 of the object of interest.\nWe formalize the task of localizing the states of objects as a discriminative clustering problem where the goal is to find an assignment matrix Yn ∈ {0, 1}Mn×2, where (Yn)mk = 1 indicates that the m-th tracklet represents the object in state k.

The minimization in Ws actually leads to a convex quadratic cost function in Y (see [3]). The first term in (2) is the discriminative loss on the data that measures how easily the input dataXs is classified by the linear classifierWs when the object state assignment is given by matrix Y . In other words, we wish to find a labeling Y for given object tracklets into two states (or no state) so that their appearance features X are easily classified by a linear classifier. To steer the cost towards the right solution, we employ the following constraints (encoded by Y ∈ Y in (1)). Only one object is manipulated at a time : non overlap constraint. As it is common in instructional videos, we assume that only one object can be manipulated at a given time. However, in practice, it is common to have multiple (spatially diverse) tracklets that occur at the same time, for example, due to a false positive detection in the same frame. To overcome this issue, we impose that at most one tracklet can be labeled as belonging to state 1 or state 2 at any given time. We refer to this constraint as “non overlap” in problem (1). state 1 → Action → state 2: ordering constraints. We assume that the manipulating action transforms the object from an initial state to a final state and that both states are present in each video. This naturally introduces two constraints. The first one is the ordering constraints on the labeling Yn, i.e. the state 1 should occur before state 2 in each video. The second constraint imposes that we have at least one tracklet labeled as state 1 and at least one tracklet labeled as state 2. We call this last constraint the “at least one” constraint in contrast to forcing “exactly one” ordered prediction as previously proposed in a discriminative clustering approach on video for action localization [6]. This new type of constraint brings additional optimization challenges that we address in Section 4.2."

It is exactly the case for our relaxed problem, where the linear program over the convex hull of feasible integer matrices can be solved efficiently via dynamic programming. Moreover, [27] recently showed that the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with line-search converges to a stationary point for non-convex objectives at a rate of O(1/ √ k). We thus use this algorithm for the joint optimization of (1). As the objective is quadratic, we can perform exact line-search analytically, which speeds up convergence in practice.

Differently here, we have to deal with\nthe spatial (non overlap) constraint and finding “at least one” candidate tracklet per state. To deal with these two requirements, we propose a novel dynamic programming approach. First, the “at least one” constraint is encoded by having a memory variable which indicates whether state 1 or state 2 have already been visited. This variable is used to propose valid state decisions for consecutive tracklets. Second, the challenging “non-overlap” tracklet constraint is included by constructing valid left-to-right paths in a cost matrix while carefully considering the possible authorized transitions.

We build a dataset of manipulation actions by collecting videos from different\nsources: the instructional video dataset introduced in [2], the Charades dataset from [37], and some additional videos downloaded from YouTube. We focus on “third person” videos (rather than egocentric) as such videos depict a variety of people in different settings and can be obtained on a large scale from YouTube. We annotate the precise temporal extent of seven different actions3 applied to five distinct objects4. This results in 630 annotated occurrences of ground truth manipulation action.\nTo evaluate object state recognition, we define a list of two states for each object. We then run automatic object detector for each involved object, track the detected object occurrences throughout the video and then subdivide the resulting long tracks into short tracklets. Finally, we label ground truth object states for tracklets within ±40 seconds of each manipulation action. We label four possible states: state 1, state 2, ambiguous state or false positive detection. The ambiguous state covers the (not so common) in-between cases, such as cup half-full. In total, we have 19,499 fully annotated tracklets out of which: 35% cover state 1 or state 2, 25% are ambiguous, and 40% are false positives. Note that this annotation is only used for evaluation purpose, and not by any of our models. Detailed statistics of the dataset are given in Appendix B. Object detection and tracking. In order to obtain detectors for the five objects, we finetune the FastRCNN network [17] with training data from ImageNet [11]. We use bounding box annotations from ImageNet when available (e.g. the “wheel” class). For the other classes, we manually labeled more than 500 instances per class. In our set-up with only moderate amount of training data, we observed that class-agnostic object proposals combined with FastRCNN performed better than FasterRCNN [35]. In detail, we use geodesic object proposals [26] and set a relatively low object detection threshold (0.4) to have good recall. We track objects using a generic KLT tracker from [4]. The tracks are then post-processed into shorter tracklets that last about one second and thus are likely to have only one object state. Object tracklet representation. For each detected object, represented by a set of bounding boxes over the course of the tracklet, we compute a CNN feature from each (extended) bounding box that we then average over the length of the tracklet to get the final representation. The CNN feature is extracted with a ROI pooling [35] of ResNet50 [19]. The ROI pooling notably allows to capture some context around the object which is important for some cases (e.g. wheel “on” or “off” the car).

Following [2], we add an appearance vector that is obtained from a 1,000 dimensional bagof-word vector of conv5 features from VGG16 [39].

We first apply our method in a weakly supervised set-up where for each action we provide an input set of clips, where we know the action occurs somewhere in the clip but we do not provide the precise temporal localization. Each clip may contain other actions that affect other objects or actions that do not affect any object at all (e.g. walking / jumping). The input clips are about 20s long and are obtained by taking approximately ± 10s of each annotated manipulation action. Evaluation metric: average precision. For all variants of our method, we use the rounded solution that reached the smallest objective during optimization. We evaluate these predictions with a precision score averaged over all the videos. A temporal action localization is said to be correct if it falls within the ground truth time interval. Similarly, a state prediction is correct if it matches the ground truth state.5 Note that a “precision” metric is reasonable in our set-up as our method is forced to predict in all videos, i.e. the recall level is fixed to all videos and the method cannot produce high precision with low recall.

In the following, we refer to “State only” whenever we use our method without looking at the action cost or the distortion measure (1). We compare to two baselines for the state discovery task. Baseline (a) evaluates chance performance. Baseline (b) performs K-means clustering of the tracklets withK = 3 (2 clusters for the states and 1 for false positives). We report performance of the best assignment for the solution with the lowest objective after 10 different initializations. Baseline (c) is obtained by running our “State only” method while using random features for tracklet representation as well as ”at least one ordering” and ”non overlap” constraints. We use random features to avoid nontrivial analytic derivation for the ”Constraints only” performance. This baseline reveals the difficulty of the problem\n5In particular, we count “ambiguous” labels as incorrect.\nand quantifies improvement brought by the ordering constraints. The next two methods are “State only” variants. Method (d) corresponds to a replacement of the “at least one constraint” by an “exactly one constraint” while the method (e) uses our new constraint. Finally, we report three joint methods that use our new joint rounding technique (7) for prediction. Method (f) corresponds to our joint method that optimizes (1). Method (g) is a simple improvement taking into account object detection score in the objective (details below). Finally, method (h) is our joint method but using the action ground truth labels as video features in order to test the effect of having perfect action localization for the task of object state discovery.\nWe first note that method (e) outperforms (d), thus highlighting the importance of the “at least one” constraint for modeling object states. While the saliency approach (taking only the most confident detection per video) was useful for action modeling in [6], it is less suitable for our setup where multiple tracklets can be in the same state. The joint approach with actions (f) outperforms the “State only” method (e) on 6 out of 7 actions and obtains better average performance, confirming the benefits of joint modeling of actions and object states. Using ground truth action locations further improves results (cf. (h) against (f)). Our weakly supervised approach (f) performs not much lower compared to using ground truth actions (h), except for the states of the coffee cup (empty/full). In this case we observe that a high number of false positive detections confuses our method. A simple way to address this issue is to add the object detection score into the objective of our method, which then prefers to assign object states to higher scoring object candidates further reducing the effect of false positives. This can be done easily by adding a linear cost reflecting the object detection score to objective (1). We denote this modified method “(g) Joint model + det. scores”. This method achieves the best average performance and highlights that additional information can be easily added to our model. Action localization results. We compare our method to three different baselines and give results in the bottom part of Table 1. Baseline (i) corresponds to chance performance,\nwhere the precision for each clip is simply the proportion of the entire clip taken by the ground truth time interval. Baseline (ii) is the method introduced in [6] used here with only one action. It also corresponds to a special case of our method where the object state part of the objective in equation (1) is turned off (salient action only). Interestingly, this baseline is actually worse than chance for several actions. This is because without additional information about objects, this method localizes other common actions in the clip and not the action manipulating the object of interest. This also demonstrates the difficulty of our experimental set-up where the input video clips often contain multiple different actions. To address this issue, we also evaluate baseline (iii), which complements [6] with the additional constraint that the action prediction has to be within the first and the last frame where the object of interest is detected, improving the overall performance above chance. Our joint approach (iv) consistently outperforms these baselines on all actions, thus showing again the strong link between object states and actions. Finally, the approach (v) is the analog of method (g) for action localization where we use ground truth state labels as tracklet features in our joint formulation showing that the action localization can be further improved with better object state descriptors. In addition, we also compare to a supervised baseline. The average obtained performance is 0.58 which is not far from our method. This demonstrates the potential of using object states for action localization. More details on this experiment are provided in Appendix E.\nBenefits of joint object-action modeling. We observe that the joint modeling of object states and actions benefits both tasks. This effect is even stronger for actions. Intuitively, knowing perfectly the object states reduces a lot the search space for action localization. Moreover, despite the recent major progress in object recognition using CNNs, action recognition still remains a hard problem with much room for improvement. Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 3 and failure cases of our method are discussed in F."

Obtaining the approximate temporal location of actions from the transcribed narration is still very challenging due to ambiguities in language (“undo bolt” and “loosen nut” refer to\nthe same manipulation) and only coarse temporal localization of the action provided by the narration. Given a manipulation action such as “remove tire”, we first find positive and negative sentences relevant for the action from an instruction website such as Wikihow. We then train a linear SVM classifier [8] on bigram text features. Finally, we use the learned classifier to score clips from the input instructional videos. In detail, the classifier is applied in a sliding window of 10 words finding the best scoring window in each input video. The clip candidates are then obtained by trimming the input videos 5 seconds before and 15 seconds after the timing of the best scoring text window to account for the fact that people usually perform the action after having talked about it. We apply our method on the top 20 video clips based on the SVM score for each manipulation action. More details about this process are provided in Appendix A. Results. As shown in Table 2, the pattern of results, where our joint method performs the best, is similar to the weakly supervised set-up described in Sec. 5.2. This highlights the robustness of our model to noisy input data – an important property for scaling-up the method to Internet scale datasets. To assess how well our joint method could do with perfect retrieval, we also report results for a “Curated” setup where we replace the automatically retrieved clips with the 20s clips used in Sec. 5.2 for the corresponding videos."

      "text" : "In Section 5.3 we proposed an automatic method for retrieving video clips with manipulated objects. This method makes use of narrations that come along with instructional videos. Narrations in the form of text are first obtained automatically with Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)6 and then processed as detailed below.\nLanguage dataset. For each manipulation action, we first find relevant positive and negative sentences on instruction websites such as Wikihow. On average we obtain about 12 positive and 50 negative sentences per action.\nLanguage features. Off-the-shelf methods for text parsing typically fail in the absence of punctuation. To process ASR output, which comes without punctuation, we propose to use the following simple but robust text representation. We represent every 10-word window of the narration by a TF-IDF vector based of uni-grams and bi-grams. We use the same TF-IDF representation to encode text in our Language dataset on the level of sentences.\nSVM training. We train binary linear SVM classifiers to identify manipulation actions using the Language dataset for training and the regularization parameter C = 10. The obtained classifiers are then used to score every 10-word window of text narrations. Video clips with the temporal correspondence to the top-scoring text narrations for each action are then retrieved. To deduce the temporal extent of the video clip given the top-scoring window, we trim 5 seconds before and 15 seconds after the corresponding timing. This is to account for the fact that people are usually doing the action after speaking about it. These are the clips we use for our evaluation in Section 5.3 of the main paper.\n6The ASR transcriptions are directly downloaded from YouTube.\nIllustration.

      "heading" : "C. Dynamic program for the tracklets",
      "text" : "The track constraints defined in Section 3.1 introduce new challenges compared to the previous related work [2, 5, 24]. Recall that there are three main components in the constraints. First, we assume that only one object is manipulated at a given time. Thus at most one tracklet can be assigned to a state at a given time. This constraint is referred to as the non-overlap constraint. Second, we have the ordering constraint that imposes that state 1 always happens before state 2. The last constraint imposes that we have at least one tracklet labeled as state 1 and at least one tracklet labeled as state 2. We need to be able to minimize linear functions over this set of constraints in order to use the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. More precisely, as the constraints decompose over the different clips, we can solve independently for each clip n the following linear problem:\nminimize Yn∈{0,1}Mn×2\nTr(CTn Yn) (8)\ns.t. Yn ∈ Yn︸ ︷︷ ︸ non-overlap + ordering\n+ at least one\n,\nwhere Cn ∈ RMn×2 is a cost matrix that typically comes from the computation of the gradient of the cost function at the current iterate. In order to solve this problem, we use a dynamic program approach that we explain next. Recall that we are given Mn tracklets (yi)Mni=1 and our goal is to output the Yn matrix that assigns to each of these tracklets either state 1, state 2 or no state at all while respecting the constraints. The whole method is illustrated in Figure 5 with a toy example.\nNon-overlap data structure for the tracklets. We first pre-process the tracklets to build an auxiliary data-structure that is used to enforce the non-overlap constraint between the tracklets, as illustrated in Figure 5a. First, we sort and index each tracklet by their beginning time, and add two fictitious tracklets: y0 as the starting tracklet and yf as the ending tracklet. These two tracklets are used to start and terminate the dynamic program. If all the tracklets were\nsequentially ordered without any overlap in time, then we could simply make a decision for each of them sequentially as was done in previous work on action localization for example (one decision per time step) [5]. To enforce the non-overlap constraint, we force the decision process to choose only one possible successor among the group of overlapping valid immediate successors of a tracklet. For each tracklet yi, we thus define its (smallest) set of “valid successors” as the earliest tracklet yj7 after yi that is also non-overlapping with yi, as well as any other tracklet yl for l > j that is overlapping with yj (thus giving the earliest valid group of overlapping tracklets). The valid successors\n7Earliest means the smallest j.\nare illustrated by red dotted arrows in Figure 5a. For example, the valid successors of y1 are y3 (the earliest one that is non-overlapping) as well as y4 (which overlaps with y3 thus forming an overlapping group). Skipping a tracklet in this decision process means that we assign it to zero (which trivially always satisfies the non-overlapping constraint); whereas once we choose a tracklet to potentially assign it to state 1 or 2, we cannot visit any overlapping tracklet by construction of the valid successors, thus maintaining the non-overlap constraint.\nDynamic program. The dynamic programming approach is used when we can solve a large problem by solving a sequence of inclusive subproblems that are linked by a simple recursive formula and that use overlapping solutions (which can be stored in a table for efficiency). In terms of implementation, [5] encoded their dynamic program as finding an optimal path inside a cost matrix. This approach is particularly suited when the update cost rule depends only on the arrival entry in the cost matrix as opposed to be transition dependent. As we will show below, we can encode the solution to our problem in a way that satisfies this property. We therefore use the framework of [5] by casting our problem as a search for an optimal path inside a cost matrix\nC̃n illustrated in Figure 5b, and where the valid transitions encode the possible constraints.\nOne main difference with [5] is that we have to deal with the challenging at least one constraint in the context of ordered labels. To do so, we can filter further the set of valid decisions by using “memory states” that encode in which of the following three situations we are: (i) that state 1 has not yet been visited, (ii) that state 1 has already been visited, but state 2 has not yet been visited (and thus that we can either come back to state 1 or go to state 2) and (iii) that both states have been visited. These memory states can be encoded by interleaving complete rows of 0s in between columns of Cn stored as rows, to obtain the 5 ×Mn matrix C̃n. These new rows encode the three different memory states previously described when making a prediction of 0 for a specific tracklet, and we enforce the correct memory semantic by only allowing a path to move to the same row or the row immediately below, except for state 1 which can also move directly to state 2 (two rows below), and the middle “between state 1/2” row, where one can go up one row additionally to state 1. Finally, the valid transitions between columns (tracklets) are given by the valid successors data structure as given in Figure 5a to encode the non-overlap constraints. Combining these two constraints (at least one ordering and non-overlap), we illustrate with grey arrows in Figure 5b the possible transitions from the states along the path in red. To describe the dynamic program recursion below, we need to go the opposite direction from the successors, and thus we say that yj is a predecessor of yi if and only if yi is a successor of yj .\nTo perform the dynamic program, we maintain a matrix Dn of the same size as C̃n whereDn(k, i) contains the minimal valid path cost of going from (1, y0) to (k, yi) inside the cost matrix C̃n. To define the cost update recursion to compute Dn(k, i), let P (k, i) be the set of tuples (l, j) for which it is possible to go from (l, j) to (k, yi) according to the rules described above. The update rule is then as follows:\nDn(k, i) = min (l,j)∈P (k,i) Dn(l, j) + C̃n(k, yi). (9)\nAs we see here, the added cost depends only on the arrival entry C̃n(k, yi). We can therefore use the approach of [5] and only consider entry costs rather than edge costs. Thanks to our indexing property (tracklets are sorted by the beginning time), we can update the dynamic program matrix by filling each column of Dn one after the other. Once this update is finished, we back-track to get the best path by starting from the ending track (predecessors of yf ) at the last row (to be sure that both states have been visited) that has the lowest score in the Dn matrix. The total complexity of this algorithm is of order O(Mn)."

      "heading" : "D. Joint cost rounding method",
      "text" : "Recall that we propose to use a convex relaxation approach in order to obtain a candidate solution of main problem (1). Thus, we need to round the relaxed solution afterward in order to get a valid integer solution. We propose here a new rounding that is adapted to our joint problem. We referred to this rounding as the joint cost rounding (see Section 4 of main paper). This rounding is inspired by [6, 2]. They observe that using the learned W ∗ classifier to round gives them better solutions, both in terms of objective value and performance. We propose to use its natural extension for our joint model. We first fix the classifiers for actions Wa and for states Ws to their relaxed solution (W ∗a ,W ∗ s ) and find, for each clip n, the couple (Zn, Yn) that minimizes the joint cost (7). To do so, we observe that we can enumerate all Tn possibilities for Zn, and solve for each of them the minimization of the joint cost with respect to Yn. The minimization with respect to Yn can be addressed as follows. First, we observe that the distortion function (6) is bilinear in (Zn, Yn). Let Zn be a Tn × 1 vector, and let 12 be a vector of ones of length 2. We can actually write: d(Zn, Yn) = Tr((BnZn1>2 )\n>Yn) for some matrix Bn ∈ RMn×Tn . Thus, when Zn is fixed, the joint term d(Zn, Yn) is actually a simple linear function of Yn. In addition, the quadratic term in Yn coming from (2) is also linear over the integer points (using the fact that y2 = y for y ∈ {0, 1}). Thus, when Zn, W ∗a and W ∗s are fixed, the minimization over Yn is a linear program (8) that we solve using our dynamic program from the previous section. The final algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. Its complexity is of order O(TnMn)."

    "abstractText" : "Many human activities involve object manipulations aiming to modify the object state. Examples of common state changes include full/empty bottle, open/closed door, and attached/detached car wheel. In this work, we seek to automatically discover the states of objects and the associated manipulation actions. Given a set of videos for a particular task, we propose a joint model that learns to identify object states and to localize state-modifying actions. Our model is formulated as a discriminative clustering cost with constraints. We assume a consistent temporal order for the changes in object states and manipulation actions, and introduce new optimization techniques to learn model parameters without additional supervision. We demonstrate successful discovery of seven manipulation actions and corresponding object states on a new dataset of videos depicting real-life object manipulations. We show that our joint formulation results in an improvement of object state discovery by action recognition and vice versa.",
