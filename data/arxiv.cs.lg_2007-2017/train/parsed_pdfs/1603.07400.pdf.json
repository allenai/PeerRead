      "text" : "large variety of applications. Extensive supports for flexibility in these systems limit their energy efficiencies. Given that big data applications are among the main emerging workloads for computing systems, specialized architectures for big data processing are needed to enable low power and high throughput execution. Several big data applications are particularly focused on classification and clustering tasks. In this paper we propose a multicore heterogeneous architecture for big data processing. This system has the capability to process key machine learning algorithms such as deep neural network, autoencoder, and kmeans clustering. Memristor crossbars are utilized to provide low power high throughput execution of neural networks. The system has both training and recognition (evaluation of new input) capabilities. The proposed system could be used for classification, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and anomaly detection applications. The system level area and power benefits of the specialized architecture is compared with the NVIDIA Telsa K20 GPGPU. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed architecture can provide four to six orders of magnitude more energy efficiency over GPGPUs for big data processing.\nKeywords–Low power architecture; memristor crossbars;\nautoencoder; unsupervised training; big data.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nith the increasingly large volumes of data being generated in almost all fields including commerce,\nscience, medicine, security, and social networks, one of the\nkey application drivers of future computing systems is the processing of these data to decipher patterns within it to help\nmake better decisions. This process is typically described as\nbig data analytics and involves machine learning to analyze and categorize the data.\nTwo broad categories of machine learning algorithms are supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning,\nwe know exactly what classes of data exist and a sample of\ndata for each class is available (this is described as labeled data). Supervised machine learning algorithms are trained on\nthis labeled datasets, and once trained, the algorithms can then sort out new unlabeled data into the existing set of classes.\nA more challenging, and perhaps more common, form of\nbig data analytics involves unlabeled data. In this case the\nmachine learning algorithms need to examine large volumes\nof data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, and other useful information. Some of the most commonly used\nunsupervised processing includes, autoencoder, restricted\nBoltzmann machines, self organizing maps, and k-means clustering.\nBig data processing using machine learning algorithms have traditionally been run on clusters of GPUs. One of the\nmajor problems with these systems is their high power\nconsumption and the need for higher throughput. Due to the limits of Dennard scaling and Moore’s Law, alternative\narchitectures are gaining importance. Several studies have examined low power, high throughput architectures for\nmachine learning applications. Examples of this include\nDaDianNao [1] and PuDianNao [2], both of which accelerate machine learning algorithms through digital circuits. In\nPuDianNao neuron synaptic weights are stored in the off-chip\nmemory, and hence requires back and forth data movement\nduring training, between off-chip memory and the processing\nchip. In DaDianNao neuron synaptic weights are stored in eDRAM and are later brought into Neural Functional Units\nfor execution. Input data are initially stored in the central\neDRAM. This system utilized dynamic wormhole routing for data transfers.\nThis paper presents a memristor crossbar based multicore architecture to implement unsupervised training of streaming\ndata. It is a heterogeneous architecture consisting of\nmemristor neural cores, a digital unit for clustering, a RISC core for system configuration and initialization, and an on-\nchip routing network for data communication. The key\nbenefits of this approach are high throughput at very low power and area consumption. In this paper we utilize\nmemristor crossbars for neural network based system design\nand examine supervised and unsupervised learning of the\nsystem. The proposed system could be used for classification,\nunsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction and anomaly detection applications.\nMemristors [3,4] have received significant attention as a potential building block for neuromorphic systems [5,6]. In\nthese systems memristors are used in a crossbar structure to\nefficiently evaluate multiply-add operations in parallel in the analog domain (these are the dominant operations in neural\nW\nnetworks). This enables highly dense neuromorphic systems\nwith great computational efficiency [7]. We are using\nmemristor crossbars which provide high synaptic weight\ndensity and parallel analog processing consuming very low energy. Memristor based synapses are 146 times denser than\ntraditional digital SRAM synapse (assuming 8 bits precision\nin both cases). In this system processing happens at physical location of the data. Data transfer energy and functional unit\nenergy consumptions are saved significantly.\nThe most recent results for memristor based neuromorphic systems can be seen in [12-15]. These works do not examine\nmulticore design and system level evaluations are not studied. [12,13] examined only linearly separable problems. [16]\nexamined memristor based neural networks utilizing four\nmemristors per synapse where the proposed systems utilize two memristors per synapse. They propose deployment of the\nmemristor based system as neural accelerator with RISC system while proposed systems are standalone embedded\nprocessing architecture. Furthermore, the proposed system\nhas on-chip unsupervised learning capability.\nDetailed circuit level simulations (in SPICE) of memristor crossbars were carried out to verify the neural operations. Both the programming and the recognition phase of the neural networks were examined. These simulations utilized an accurate memristor device model, and take low level circuit details such as wire resistance, capacitance, and driver circuits into consideration. We have examined the power, area, and performance of the proposed multicore system and compared them with a GPU based system. Our results indicate that the memristor based architecture can provide up to six orders of magnitude more energy efficiency over GPU for the selected benchmarks.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: section II\ndemonstrates overall heterogeneous multicore architecture. Section III describes memristor device, neuron circuit design,\nautoencoder and memristor based autoencoder design.\nSection IV describes designs of the heterogeneous cores. Sections V and VI describe experimental setup and results\nrespectively. Section VII describes related works in the area\nand finally in section VIII we summarize our work."

      "text" : "In this paper we propose an energy efficient multicore heterogeneous architecture to accelerate both supervised and unsupervised machine learning applications. The architecture has implementation of the backpropagation training algorithm, autoencoder, deep neural network, and k-means clustering algorithm. These are some of the fundamental algorithms in deep learning and are used for big data processing.\nA common approach for unsupervised learning is clustering which uses dimensionality reduction and feature extraction as preprocessing. Dimensionality reduction allows the data of large dimension to be represented using a smaller set of features, and thus allow a simpler clustering algorithm to process an unlabeled dataset. In this paper, we implement the commonly used autoencoder algorithm for dimensionality\nreduction and the k-means algorithm for clustering. The autoencoder is based on multilayered neural networks and thus is implemented using memristor based neural processing cores. As the input data can be of high dimensionality (such as a high resolution image), multiple neural cores are needed to implement the autoencoder.\nWe utilize the back-propagation algorithm for training the autoencoder. Due to the use of the autoencoder, a reduced dimension k-means implementation is sufficient, and hence we utilize a single digital core to implement k-means clustering. Deep neural network applications for supervised training could also be implemented in the proposed system. For deep network, autoencoder is used for the unsupervised layer wise pre training and supervised fine tuning is performed on the pre trained weights utilizing the backpropagation algorithm. The system has both training and inference capabilities. It can be used for classification, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and anomaly detection applications.\nwith several neural cores (NC), one clustering core connected through a 2-D\nmesh routing network. (R: router).\nFig. 1 shows the overall system architecture which includes memristor crossbar based neural cores (NC) and a digital unit for clustering. Memristor crossbar neural cores are utilized to provide low power, high throughput execution of neural networks. The cores in the system are connected through an on-chip routing network (R). The neural cores receive their inputs from main memory holding the training data through the on-chip routers and a buffer between the routing and main memory as shown in Fig. 1.\nSince the proposed architecture is geared towards machine learning applications (including big data processing), the training data will be used multiple times during the training phase. As a result, access to a high bandwidth memory system is needed, and thus we propose the use of 3D stacked DRAM. Using through Silicon vias reduces memory access time and energy, thereby reducing overall system power. To allow efficient access to the main memory utilizing a DMA controller that is initialized by a RISC processing core. A single issue pipelined RISC core is used to reduce power consumption.\nAn on-chip routing network is needed to transfer neuron outputs among cores in a multicore system. In feed-forward neural networks, the outputs of a neuron layer are sent to the following layer after every iteration (as opposed to a spiking network, where outputs are sent only if a neuron fires). This means that the communication between neurons is deterministic and hence a static routing network can be used for the core-to-core communications. In this study, we assumed a static routing network as this would be lower power consuming than a dynamic routing network. The network is statically time multiplexed between cores for exchanging multiple neuron outputs.\nSRAM based static routing is utilized to facilitate reprogrammability in the switches. Fig. 2 shows the routing switch design. Note carefully that the switch allows outputs from a core to be routed back into the core to implement recurrent networks or multi-layer networks where all the neuron layers are within the same core."

      "text" : "The memristor device was first theorized in 1971 by Dr. Leon Chua [3]. Memristors are essentially nanoscale variable resistors, where the resistance is modified if a voltage greater than a write threshold voltage (Vth) is applied [17]. Hence their resistance can be read by applying a voltage below Vth across them without changing the device state. Several research groups have demonstrated memristive behavior using different materials. One such device, composed of layers of HfOx and AlOx [18], has a high on state resistance (RON≈10kΩ), a very high resistance ratio (ROFF/RON≈1000) and a write threshold voltage of about 1.3 V. Physical memristors can be laid out in a high density grid known as a crossbar. The schematic and layout of a memristor crossbar can each be seen in Fig. 3. A memristor in the crossbar structure occupies 4F2 area (where F is the device feature size). This is 36 times smaller than a SRAM memory cell. A memristor crossbar can perform many multiply-add operations in parallel and the conductance of multiple memristors in a crossbar can be updated in parallel. Multiplyadd operations are the dominant operations in neural networks and training of neural networks require update of synaptic weights iteratively. As a consequence, memristors have a\ngreat potential as a synaptic element in a neural network based system design."

      "text" : "In this paper we have utilized memristors as neuron synaptic weights. The circuit in Fig. 5 shows the memristor based neuron circuit design utilized in this paper. In this circuit, each data input is connected to two virtually grounded op-amps (operational amplifiers) through a pair of memristors. For a given row, if the conductance of a memristor connected to the first column (σA+) is higher than the conductance of the memristor connected to the second column (σA-), then the pair of memristors represents a positive synaptic weight. In the inverse situation, when σA+ < σA-, the memristor pair represents a negative synaptic weight. As the op-amps in Fig. 5 virtually ground the two neuron columns, the currents through the first and second columns can be calculated as (\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34+ + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD+) and (\uD835\uDC34\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34− + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD−) respectively.\nBA\nAssume that\n\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC57 = 4\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC53[{\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34+ + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD+} − {\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34− + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD−}]\n= 4\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC53[\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34+ − \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34−) + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD(\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD+ − \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD−)]\nThe output, yj of the op-amp connected directly with the second column represents the neuron output. When the power rails of the op-amps, VDD and VSS are set to 0.5V and -0.5V respectively, the neuron circuit implements the activation function h(x) as in Eq. (3) where \uD835\uDC65 = 4\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC53[\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34+ − \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDC34−) + ⋯ + \uD835\uDEFD(\uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD+ − \uD835\uDF0E\uD835\uDEFD−)]. This implies, the neuron output can be expressed as h(DPj). Fig. 6 shows that h(x) closely approximates the activation function, \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65) = 1 1+\uD835\uDC52−\uD835\uDC65 − 0.5. The values of VDD and VSS are chosen such that no memristor gets a voltage greater than Vth across it during evaluation."

      "text" : "Several big data applications are particularly focused on classification and clustering tasks. The robustness of such systems depends on how well they can extract important features from the raw data. For big data processing we are interested for a generic feature extraction mechanism which will work for a variety of applications. The autoencoder [19] is a popular method for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction approach which automatically learns features from unlabeled data. This means, it is an unsupervised approach and no supervision is needed.\nThe architecture of the autoencoder is similar to a multilayer neural network as shown in Fig. 7. An autoencoder tries to learn the function hW,b(x) ≈ x. That is, it tries to learn an approximation to the identity function, such that output x’ is similar to input x. By placing constraints on the network, such\nas by limiting the number of hidden units, we can discover useful patterns within the data.\nAs a concrete example, suppose the inputs x are the pixel intensity values from a 10×10 image (100 pixels) so n = 100. An autoencoder determining compressed representation of these data has 100 inputs, 50 neurons in the hidden layer and 100 output neurons. The network is trained such that output layer neurons generate same values as the applied inputs. Since there are only 50 hidden units, the network is forced to\nlearn a compressed representation of the input. This paper utilizes memristor devices to develop novel extreme low power implementations of on-chip training circuitry for unsupervised training of the autoencoder."

      "text" : "The circuit implementation of the training algorithm for the neural network in Fig. 8 can be broken down into following major steps:\n1. Apply inputs to layer 1 and record the layer 2 neuron output errors. 2. Back-propagate layer 2 errors through the second\nlayer weights and record the layer 1 errors.\n3. Update the synaptic weights.\nThe circuit implementations of these steps are detailed below:\nStep 1: A set of inputs is applied to the layer 1 neurons, and the layer 2 neuron outputs are measured. This process is\nshown in Fig. 8. Errors are discretized into 8 bit representations (one sign bit and 7 bits for magnitude).\nStep 2: The layer 2 errors (δL2,1 and δL2,2) are applied to the layer 2 weights after conversion from digital to analog form as shown in Fig. 9 to generate the layer 1 errors (δL1,1 to δL1,6). The memristor crossbar in Fig. 9 is the same as the layer 2 crossbar in Fig. 8. Assume that the synaptic weight associated with input i, neuron j (second layer neuron) is wij=σij+ - σij- for i=1,2,3 and j=1,2,..,4. In the backward phase we want to evaluate\nδL1,i = Σjwij δL2,j for i=1,2,3 and j=1,2,..,4.\n= Σj(σij+ - σij-)δL2,j = Σjσij+δL2,j - Σjσij-δL2,j (7)\nThe circuit in Fig. 9 is essentially evaluating the same operations as Eq. (7), applying both δL2,j and -δL2,j to the crossbar columns for j=1,2,3. The back propagated errors are discretized using ADCs and are stored in buffers. To reduce the training circuit overhead, we can multiplex the back propagated error generation circuit as shown in Fig. 10. In this circuit, enabling the appropriate pass transistors, back propagated errors are sequentially generated and stored in the buffer. Access to the pass transistors will be controlled by a shift register.\nStep 3: The weight update procedures for both layers are similar. They take neuron inputs, errors, and intermediate neuron outputs (DPj) to generate a set of training pulses. The training unit essentially implements Eq. (6). To update a synaptic weight by an amount Δw, the conductance of the memristor connected to the first column of the corresponding neuron will be updated by amount Δw/2 (where Δw/2=\uD835\uDF02 × \uD835\uDEFF\uD835\uDC57 × \uD835\uDC53′(\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC57) × \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56) and the memristor connected to the second column of the corresponding neuron by amount -Δw/2. We will describe the weight update procedure for the first columns of the neurons (odd crossbar columns in Fig. 8). The weight update procedure for the second columns of the neurons (even columns) is similar to the procedure for the first columns, except that we need to multiply the neuron errors (\uD835\uDEFF\uD835\uDC57) by -1.\nIn Eq. (6) we need to evaluate the derivative of the activation function for the dot product of the neuron inputs and weights (DPj). The DPj value of neuron j is essentially the scaled difference of the currents through the two columns implementing the neuron (see section III(B)). Applying the inputs to the neuron again, the difference of column currents are stored in the buffer after converting into digital form. The\nderivative of the activation function (f’) is evaluated using a lookup table. A digital multiplier is utilized to multiply the neuron error (δj) and f’(DPj). The number δj×f’(DPj) is converted into analog form and is applied to the training pulse generation unit (see Fig. 11(b)). For training, pulses of variable amplitude and variable duration are produced. The amplitude of the training signal is modulated by the neuron input (xi) and is applied to the row wire connecting the desired memristor (see Fig. 11(a)). The duration of the training pulse is modulated by η×δj×f’(DPj) and is applied to the column wire connecting the desired memristor (see Fig. 11(b)). The combined effect of the two voltages applied across the memristor will update the conductance by an amount proportional to \uD835\uDF02 × \uD835\uDEFF\uD835\uDC57 × \uD835\uDC53′(\uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC57) × \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56."

These simulations considered the wire resistance and capacitance within the crossbar as well. The results show that the crossbar required 20 ns to be evaluated. As the memristor crossbars evaluate all neurons in one step, the majority of time in these systems is spent in transferring neuron outputs between cores through the routing network.

According to the data presented in [18] this device has a minimum resistance of 10 kΩ, a resistance ratio of 103, and the full resistance range of the device can be switched in 20 μs by applying 2.5 V across the device.\nSPICE simulations of large memristor crossbars are very time consuming. Therefore, we examined the on-chip supervised training approach with the Iris dataset [28] which utilizes crossbars of manageable sizes. A two layer network with four inputs, ten hidden neurons and one output neuron was utilized. Fig. 16 shows the Matlab-SPICE training simulation on the Iris dataset. It shows that the neural network was able to learn the desired classifiers."

As the SPICE simulation of this network size takes a very long time, we did this experiment in MATLAB. During training the autoencoder was trained using only normal data packets. It is expected that during evaluation, for normal data packets the differences between input and reconstruction will be smaller compared to the differences for the attack packets. The network was trained only with 5292 normal packet data (no anomalous packets were used during training).\nFigures 18 and 19 show the distribution of the distances between inputs and the corresponding reconstructions for the normal packets and the attack packets respectively. From Fig. 20 it is seen that the system can detect about 96.6% of the anomalous packets with a 4% false detection rate. Similar approaches could be used for other big data applications where the objective is to detect anomalous patterns from large volumes of continuously streaming data in real time at low power.\nFig. 19.

Specialized architectures [29-32] can significantly reduce the power consumption for neural\nnetwork applications and yet provide high performance\nIBM’s TrueNorth chip consists of 5.4 billion transistors [33]. It has 4,096 neurosynaptic cores interconnected via an\nintra-chip network that integrates one million programmable\nspiking neurons and 256 million configurable synapses. The basic building block is a core, a self-contained neural network\nwith 256 input lines (axons), and 256 outputs (neurons) connected via 256×256 directed, programmable synaptic\nconnections. With a 400×240-pixel video input at 30 frames-\nper-second, the chip consumes 63mW. Key differences\nbetween this system and our system are that TrueNorth uses\nspiking neurons, has asynchronous communications, and\nallows the SRAM arrays to enter ultra low leakage modes. We examine the impact of using leakage-less SRAM arrays in our\nstudy.\nDaDianNao and PuDianNao [1,2] are accelerator for deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). These systems are based on a fully digital design. In PuDianNao [2] neuron synaptic weights are stored in off-chip memory which requires data movement during training back and forth between the off-chip memory and the processing chip. In DaDianNao [1], neuron synaptic weights are stored in eDRAM and are later brought into a neural functional unit for execution. Input data are initially stored in a central eDRAM. This system utilized dynamic wormhole routing for data transfers. It was able to achieve 150× energy reduction over GPUs. ShiDianNao is an accelerator only for CNNs. As CNNs utilize shared weights, a small on-chip SRAM cache was able to store the whole network’s weights.\nSt. Amant et al. [34] presented a compilation approach\nwhere a user would annotate a code segment for conversion to a neural network. This study examined transformation of\nseveral kernels including FFT, JPEG, K-means, and the Sobel edge detector into equivalent neural networks. In this work\nthey utilized analog neural cores to accelerate a RISC\nprocessor for general purpose codes. Our approach varies from this in that we are examining standalone neural cores for\nembedded applications, and using memristors for the processing.\nBelhadj et al. [35] proposed multicore architectures for\nspiking neurons and evaluated them for embedded signal processing applications. They stored synaptic weights in\ndigital form and used digital to analog converters to process\nthe neurons. There were significant differences in the neuron circuit designs and neural algorithm compared to our system."

    "abstractText" : "General purpose computing systems are used for a large variety of applications. Extensive supports for flexibility in these systems limit their energy efficiencies. Given that big data applications are among the main emerging workloads for computing systems, specialized architectures for big data processing are needed to enable low power and high throughput execution. Several big data applications are particularly focused on classification and clustering tasks. In this paper we propose a multicore heterogeneous architecture for big data processing. This system has the capability to process key machine learning algorithms such as deep neural network, autoencoder, and kmeans clustering. Memristor crossbars are utilized to provide low power high throughput execution of neural networks. The system has both training and recognition (evaluation of new input) capabilities. The proposed system could be used for classification, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and anomaly detection applications. The system level area and power benefits of the specialized architecture is compared with the NVIDIA Telsa K20 GPGPU. Our experimental evaluations show that the proposed architecture can provide four to six orders of magnitude more energy efficiency over GPGPUs for big data processing.
