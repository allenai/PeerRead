It requires not only the recognition of visual objects in an image and the semantic interactions between objects, but the ability to capture visuallanguage interactions and learn how to “translate” the visual understanding to sensible sentence descriptions. The most important part at the center of this visual-language modeling is to capture the semantic correlations across image and text modalities by learning a multimodal joint model. While some previous works [20, 15, 25, 17, 16] have been proposed to address the problem of image captioning, they are rely on either use sentence templates, or treat it as retrieval task through ranking the best matching sentence in database as caption. Those approaches usually suffer difficulty in generating variable-length and novel sentences. Recent work [11, 10, 13, 22, 32, 37] indicate that embedding visual and language to common semantic space with relatively shallow recurrent neural network (RNN) yield promising results.\nIn this work, we propose novel architectures to the problem of image captioning. Different to previous models, we learn a visual-language space where sentence embeddings are encoded using bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and visual embeddings are encoded with CNN. Bi-LSTM is able to summarize long range visual-language interactions from forward and backward directions. Inspired by the architectural depth of human brain, we also explore the deep bidirectional LSTM architectures to learn higher level visual-language embeddings. All proposed models can be trained in end-to-end by optimizing a joint loss.\nWhy bidirectional LSTMs? In unidirectional sentence generation, one general way of predicting next word wt with visual context I and history textual context w1:t−1 is maximize logP (wt|I, w1:t−1). While unidirectional model includes past context, it is still limited to retain future context wt+1:T that can be used for reasoning previous word wt by maximizing logP (wt|I, wt+1:T ). Bidirectional model tries to overcome the shortcomings that each unidirectional (forward and backward direction) model suffers on its own and exploits the past and future dependence to give a prediction. As in Figure 1, example images with bidirectionally generated sentences intuitively support our assumption that bidirectional captions are complementary, combining them can generate more sensible captions.\nWhy deeper LSTMs? The recent success of deep CNN in image classification and object detection [14, 31] demonstrates that deep, hierarchical models can be more efficient at learning representation than shallower ones. This motivated our work to explore deeper LSTM architectures in the context of learning bidirectional visual-language embed-\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 79\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 4\nA pr\n2 01\n6\ndings. As claimed in [28], if we consider LSTM as a composition of multiple hidden layers that unfolded in time, LSTM is already deep network. But this is the way of increasing“horizontal depth”in which network weights W are reused at each time step and limited to learn more representative features as increasing the“vertical depth”of network. To design deep LSTM, one straightforward way is to stack multiple LSTM layers as hidden to hidden transition. Alternatively, instead of stacking multiple LSTM layers, we propose to add multilayer perception(MLP) as intermediate transition between LSTM layers. This can not only increase LSTM network depth, but can also prevent the parameter size from growing dramatically.\nThe core contributions of this work are threefold:\n• We propose an end-to-end trainable multimodal bidirectional LSTM (see Sec.3.2) and its deeper variant models (see Sec.3.3) that embed image and sentence into a high level semantic space by exploiting both long term history and future context.\n• We visualize the evolution of hidden states of bidirectional LSTM units to qualitatively analyze and understand how to generate sentence that conditioned by visual context information over time (see Sec.4.4).\n• We demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed models on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO. Our experimental results show that bidirectional LSTM models achieve highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art on caption generation (see Sec.4.5) and perform significantly better than recent methods on retrieval task (see Sec.4.6)."

      "text" : "Multimodal representation learning [26, 33] has significant value in multimedia understanding and retrieval. The shared concept across modalities plays an important role\nin bridging the “semantic gap” of multimodal data. Image captioning falls into this general category of learning multimodal representations.\nRecently, several approaches have been proposed for image captioning. We can roughly classify those methods into three categories. The first category is template based approaches that generate caption templates based on detecting objects and discovering attributes within image. For example, the work [20] was proposed to parse a whole sentence into several phrases, and learn the relationships between phrases and objects within an image. In [15], conditional random field(CRF) was used to correspond objects, attributes and prepositions of image content and predict the best label. Other similar works were presented in [25, 17, 16]. These methods are typically hard-designed and rely on fixed template, which mostly lead to poor performance in generating variable-length sentences. The second category is retrieval based approach, this sort of methods treat image captioning as retrieval task. By leveraging distance metric to retrieve similar captioned images, then modify and combine retrieved captions to generate caption [17]. But these approaches generally need additional procedures such as modification and generalization process to fit image query.\nInspired by the success use of CNN [14, 42] and Recurrent Neural Network [23, 24, 1]. The third category is emerged as neural network based methods [37, 39, 13, 10, 11]. Our work also belongs to this category. Among those work, Kiro et al.[12] can been as pioneer work to use neural network for image captioning with multimodal neural language model. In their follow up work [13], Kiro et al. introduced an encoderdecoder pipeline where sentence was encoded by LSTM and decoded with structure-content neural language model (SCNLM). Socher et al.[32] presented a DT-RNN (Dependency Tree-Recursive Neural Network) to embed sentence into a vector space in order to retrieve images. Later on, Mao et al.[22] proposed m-RNN which replace feed-forward neural language model in [13]. Similar architectures were introduced in NIC [37] and LRCN [4], both approaches use LSTM to learn text context. But NIC only feed visual information at first time step while Mao et al.[22] and LRCN [4]’s model consider image context at each time step. Another group of neural network based approaches has been introduced in [10, 11] where image captions generated by integrating object detection with R-CNN (region-CNN) and inferring the alignment between image regions and descriptions.\nMost recently, Fang et al.[5] used multi-instance learning and traditional maximum-entropy language model for description generation. Chen et al.[2] proposed to learn visual representation with RNN for generating image caption. In [39], Xu et al. introduced attention mechanism of human visual system into encoder-decoder framework. It is shown that attention model can visualize what the model “see” and yields significant improvements on image caption generation. Unlike those models, our model directly assumes the mapping relationship between visual-semantic is antisymmetric and dynamically learns long term bidirectional and hierarchical visual-semantic interactions with deep LSTM models. This is proved to be very effective in generation and retrieval tasks as we demonstrated in Sec.4.5 and Sec.4.6."

At given time step t, LSTM receives inputs from different sources: current input x, the previous hidden state of all LSTM units ht−1 as well as previous memory cell state ct−1.

Figure 3 presents the overview of our model, it is comprised of three modules: a CNN for encoding image inputs, a Text-LSTM (T-LSTM) for encoding sentence inputs, a Multimodal LSTM (M-LSTM) for embedding visual and textual vectors to a common semantic space and decoding to sentence. The bidirectional LSTM is implemented with two separate LSTM layers for computing forward hidden sequences −→ h and backward hidden sequences←− h . The forward LSTM starts at time t = 1 and the backward LSTM starts at time t = T . Formally, our model works as follows, for raw image input Ĩ, forward order sentence −→ S and backward order sentence ←− S , the encoding performs as\nIt = C(Ĩ; Θv) −→ h 1t = T ( −→ E −→ S ; −→ Θl) ←− h 1t = T ( ←− E ←− S ; ←− Θl) (8)\nwhere C, T represent CNN, T-LSTM respectively and Θv, Θl are their corresponding weights. −→ E and ←− E are bidirectional embedding matrices learned from network.

M aims to capture the correlation of visual context and words at different time steps. We feed visual vector I to model at each time step for capturing strong visual-word correlation. On the top of M-LSTM are Softmax layers which compute the probability distribution of next predicted word by\n−→p t+1 = F( −→ h 2t ; Ws,bs) ←−p t+1 = F( ←− h 2t ; Ws,bs) (10)\nwhere p ∈ RK and K is the vocabulary size."

Our motivation comes from the finding of [28], in which DT(S)-RNN (deep transition RNN with shortcut) is designed by adding\nhidden to hidden multilayer perception(MLP) transition. It is arguably easier to train such network. Inspired by this, we extend Bi-LSTM(Figure 4(b)) with a fully connected layer that we called Bi-F-LSTM(Figure 4(d)), shortcut connection between input and hidden states is introduced to make it easier to train model. The aim of extension models is to learn an extra hidden transition function Fh.

      "heading" : "3.4 Data Augmentation",
      "text" : "One of the most challenging aspects of training deep bidirectional LSTM models is preventing overfitting. Since our largest dataset has only 80K images [21] which might cause overfitting easily, we adopted several techniques such as finetuning on pre-trained visual model, weight decay, dropout and early stopping that commonly used in previous work. Additionally, it has been proved that data augmentation such as randomly cropping and horizontal mirror can effectively alleviate over-fitting. Inspired by this, we designed new data augmentation techniques to increase the number of image-sentence pairs. Our implementation performs on visual model, as follows:\n• Multi-Corp: Instead of randomly cropping on input image, we crop at the four corners and center region. Because we found random cropping is more tend to select center region and cause overfitting easily. By cropping four corners and center, the variations of network input can be increased to alleviate overfitting.\n• Multi-Scale: To further increase the number of imagesentence pairs, we rescale input image to multiple scales.\nFor each input image Ĩ with size H×W , it is resized to 256 × 256, then we randomly select a region with size of s∗H×s∗W , where s ∈ [1, 0.925, 0.875, 0.85] is scale ratio. s = 1 means we do not multi-scale operation on given image. Finally we resize it to AlexNet input size 227 ×227 or VggNet input size 224 × 224.\n• Vertical Mirror: Motivated by the effectiveness of widely used horizontal mirror, it is natural to also consider the vertical mirror of image for same purpose.\nThose augmentation techniques are implemented in realtime fashion. Each input image is randomly transformed using one of augmentations to network input for training. In principle, our data augmentation can increase imagesentence training pairs by roughly 40 times (5×4×2)."

      "text" : "The aim of this set experiment is to visualize the properties of proposed bidirectional LSTM model and explain how it works in generating sentence word by word over time.\nFirst, we examine the temporal evolution of internal gate states and understand how bidirectional LSTM units retain valuable context information and attenuate unimportant information. Figure 6 shows input and output data, the pattern of three sigmoid gates (input, forget and output) as well as cell states. We can clearly see that dynamic states are periodically distilled to units from time step t = 0 to t = 11. At t = 0, the input data are sigmoid modulated to input gate i(t) where values lie within in [0,1]. At this step, the values of forget gates f(t) of different LSTM units are zeros. Along with the increasing of time step, forget gate starts to decide which unimportant information should be forgot, meanwhile, decide to retain those useful information. Then the memory cell states c(t) and output gate o(t) gradually absorb the valuable context information over time and make a rich representation h(t) of the output data.\nNext, we examine how visual and textual features are embedded to common semantic space and used to predict word over time. Figure 7 shows the evolution of hidden units at different layers. For T-LSTM layer where LSTM units are conditioned by textual context from the past and future. It performs as the encoder of forward and backward sentences. At M-LSTM layer, LSTM units are conditioned by both vi-\n2https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption 3http://mscoco.org/home/\nsual and textual context. It learns the correlations between input word sequence and visual information that encoded by CNN. At given time step, by removing unimportant information that make less contribution to correlate input word and visual context, the units tend to appear sparsity pattern and learn more discriminative representations from inputs. At higher layer, embedded multimodal representations are used to compute the probability distribution of next predict word with Softmax. It should be noted, for given image, the number of words in generated sentence from forward and backward direction can be different.\nFigure 8 presents some example images with generated captions. From it we found some interesting patterns of bidirectional captions: (1) Cover different semantics, for example, in (b) forward sentence captures “couch” and “table” while backward one describes “chairs” and “table”. (2) Describe static scenario and inference dynamics, in (a) and (d), one caption describes the static scene, and the other one presents the potential action or motion that possibly happen in the next time step. (3) Generate novel sentences, from generated captions, we found that a significant proportion (88% by randomly select 1000 images on MSCOCO validation set) of generated sentences are novel (not appear in training set). But generated sentences are highly similar to ground-truth captions, for example in (d), forward caption is similar to one of ground-truth captions (“A passenger train that is pulling into a station”) and backward caption is similar to ground-truth caption (“a train is in a tunnel by a station”). It illustrates that our model has strong capability in learning visual-language correlation and generating novel sentences.\n4.5 Results on Caption Generation\nNow, we compare with state-of-the-art methods. Table 1 presents the comparison results in terms of BLEU-N. Our approach achieves very competitive performance on evaluated datasets although with less powerful AlexNet visual model. We can see that increase the depth of LSTM is beneficial on generation task. Deeper variant models mostly obtain better performance compare to Bi-LSTM, but they are inferior to latter one in B-3 and B-4 on Flickr8K. We conjecture it should be the reason that Flick8K is a relatively small dataset which suffers difficulty in training deep models with limited data. One of interesting facts we found is that by stacking multiple LSTM layers is generally superior to LSTM with fully connected transition layer although Bi-S-LSTM needs more training time. By replacing AlexNet with VggNet results in significant improvement on all BLEU evaluation metrics. We should be aware of that a recent interesting work [39] achieves the best results by integrating attention mechanism [19, 39] on this task. Although we believe incorporating such powerful mechanism into our framework can make further improvements, note that our current model Bi-LSTMV achieves the best or second best results on most of metrics while the small gap in performance between our model and Hard-AttentionV [39] is existed.\nThe further comparison on METEOR and CIDEr scores\n4On MSCOCO dataset, NIC uses 4K images for validation and test. LRCN randomly selects 5K images from MSCOCO validation set for validation and test. m-RNN uses 4K images for validation and 1K as test.\nis plotted in Figure 9. Without integrating object detection and more powerful vision model, our model (Bi-LSTMA) outperforms DeepVSV [11] in a certain margin.

This is an instance of cross-modal retrieval [6, 29, 38] which has been a hot research subject in multimedia field. Table 2 illustrates our results on different datasets. The performance of our models exceed those compared methods on most of metrics or matching existing results. In a few metrics, our model didn’t show better result than Mind’s Eye [2] which combined image and text\nfeatures in ranking (it makes this task more like multimodal retrieval) and NIC [37] which employed more powerful vision model, large beam size and model ensemble. While adopting more powerful visual model VggNet results in significant improvements across all metrics, with less powerful AlexNet model, our results are still competitive on some metrics, e.g. R@1, R@5 on Flickr8K and Flickr30K. We also note that on relatively small dataset Filckr8K, shallow model performs slightly better than deeper ones on retrieval task, which in contrast with the results on the other two datasets. As we explained before, we think deeper LSTM architectures are better suited for ranking task on large datasets which provides enough training data for more complicate model training, otherwise, overfitting occurs. By increasing data variations with our implemented data augmentation techniques can alleviate it in a certain degree. But we foresee further significant improvement gains as training example grows, by reducing reliance on augmentation with fresh data. Figure 10 presents some examples of retrieval experiments.

We\nrandomly select 10 images from Flickr8K validation set, and perform caption generation and image to sentence retrieval test for 5 times respectively. The table shows the averaged time costs across 5 test results. The time costs of network initialization is excluded. The costs of caption generation includes: computing image feature, sampling bidirectional captions, computing the final caption. The time costs for retrieval considers: computing image-sentence pair scores (totally 10 × 50 pairs), ranking sentences for each image query. As can be seen from Table 1, 2 and 3, deep models have only slightly higher time consumption but yield significant improvements and proposed Bi-F-LSTM can strike the balance between performance and efficiency.\nChallenges in exact comparison. It is challenging to make a direct, extract comparison with relate methods due to the differences in dataset division on MSCOCO. In principle, testing on smaller validation set can lead to better results, particularly in retrieval task. Since we strictly follow dataset splits as in [11], we compare to it in most cases. Another challenge is the visual model that used for encoding image inputs. Different models are employed in different works, to make a fair and comprehensive comparison, we se-\nlect commonly used AlexNet and VggNet in our work. Limitations. Although our models have showed superiorities to related methods, they also have some limitations. The first one is the training complexity that introduced by adding backward direction LSTM and increasing the depth of bidirectional LSTM. Those factors make our end-to-end model training take more time. Secondly, our proposed algorithm for selecting final captions based on forward and backward captions sometimes cannot make right decision if the length of two generated captions are quite different. Because the caption with many more words generally has higher score that computed by ∑T t=1 p(wt|I). An alternative option is to apply the selection before Softmax layer through average or max-out bidirectional word portabilities. But our experiments did not show promising result on it. As a future concern, a more efficient word-level selection need to be explored for avoiding this problem."

We also qualitatively visualized internal states of proposed model to understand how multimodal LSTM generates word at consecutive time steps. The effectiveness, generality and robustness of proposed models were evaluated on numerous datasets. Our models achieve highly completive or stateof-the-art results on both generation and retrieval tasks. Our future work will focus on exploring more sophisticated\nlanguage representation (e.g. word2vec) and incorporating multitask learning and attention mechanism into our model. We also plan to apply our model to other sequence learning tasks such as text recognition and video captioning."

Our model builds on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and two separate LSTM networks. It is capable of learning long term visual-language interactions by making use of history and future context information at high level semantic space. Two novel deep bidirectional variant models, in which we increase the depth of nonlinearity transition in different way, are proposed to learn hierarchical visual-language embeddings. Data augmentation techniques such as multi-crop, multi-scale and vertical mirror are proposed to prevent overfitting in training deep models. We visualize the evolution of bidirectional LSTM internal states over time and qualitatively analyze how our models “translate”image to sentence. Our proposed models are evaluated on caption generation and image-sentence retrieval tasks with three benchmark datasets: Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We demonstrate that bidirectional LSTM models achieve highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art results on caption generation even without integrating additional mechanism (e.g. object detection, attention model etc.) and significantly outperform recent methods on retrieval task.",
