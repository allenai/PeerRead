      "text" : "since drawn attention around the world for both its advantages as well as criticism on its drawbacks. One of the issues in MOOCs which is the lack of interactivity with the instructor has brought conversational bot into the picture to fill in this gap. In this study, a prototype of MOOCs conversational bot, MOOC-bot is being developed and integrated into MOOCs website to respond to the learner’s enquiries using text or speech input. MOOC-bot is using the popular Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base, leverage from AIML’s capability to deliver appropriate responses and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains. The system architecture of MOOC-bot consists of knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface, MOOCs website and Web Speech API to provide speech recognition and speech synthesis capability. The initial MOOC-bot prototype has the general knowledge from the past Loebner Prize winner - ALICE, course’s frequent asked questions, and a course’s content offered by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). The evaluation of MOOC-bot based on the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize has shown that it was able to provide correct answers most of the time during the test and demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation. The advantages of MOOCbot such as able to provide 24-hour service that can serve different time zones, able to have knowledge in multiple domains, and can be shared by multiple sites simultaneously have outweighed its existing limitations.\nKeywords: Conversation Agent (CA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Massive Online Open\nCourses (MOOCs), MOOC-bot\nCHAPTER 1\nINTRODUCTION"

      "heading" : "1.1 Background",
      "text" : "Online learning has long existed since the rapid growth of Internet penetration. As\nInternet usage becomes more economical and popular, online learning has found its way becoming more common and well-accepted. In recent years, a diversified form of online learning model called Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) has emerged and is drawing considerable attention from around the world (Chatterjee and Nath, 2014). This can also be evidenced by the research publication on MOOCs which has also grown exponentially from 2008 to 2013 (Aparicio et. al., 2014).\nMOOCs were first introduced in year 2008 and many universities have adopted it\nsince then. Among the prominent MOOCs providers are Coursera, edX and Udacity (Peco and Luján-Mora, 2013). Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller of Stanford University founded Coursera platform together where Ng taught “Machine Learning” while Koller taught “Probabilistic Graphical Models”. EdX is the MOOCs platform founded by Harvard University partnering with Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Udacity was conceived out of the experiment which saw Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig of Stanford University offered \"Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\" course online. All of them have\nsince extended partnerships with other universities and institutions, and offering more courses.\nUnlike conventional online courses, MOOC differs by having pre-recorded video\nlectures, online quizzes, homework assignments, midterms, final exams and the integration of social networking. The word “massive” also denotes that it can accommodate large number of participants simultaneously across the world for a single course. MOOC’s open learning styles offers flexibility with minimal registration requirements. This platform also provides online community interaction in the learning process. Due to all these characteristics, it is not possible to manage and deliver MOOC in the traditional online course’s method (Bassi et. al., 2014).\nMalaysia which has high number of Internet users can benefit from MOOCs.\nAccording to Economic Report 2013/2014 released by the Ministry of Finance Malaysia (2013), the number of Internet users in Malaysia has grown to 18 million as of end of 2012 and is expected to reach 25 million in 2015. MOOCs also fit as a lifelong learning program because it offers the time flexibility to students with families, full-time jobs, or other possible situations to learn at their convenience. The Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015- 2025 for Higher Education which was launched recently also enlisted MOOCs as one of the initiatives in spurring Malaysia’s higher education system. This blueprint further pointed out that education should not just be sought in one’s youth time but people of all ages should also enrich themselves through constant learning. The call for building “Malaysia education brand globally” in the blueprint indicates the great potential of growing MOOCs in Malaysia by local institutions (Ministry of Education Malaysia, 2015).\nHowever, MOOC’s delivery is not without its own challenges. For instance, being\naccessible worldwide would mean the instructors would not be available all the time due to\ntime zone difference. Furthermore, the large number of participants in a course could result in overwhelming student-instructor ratio. As the consequences, students may not able to get tutoring or help from the instructors easily compare to traditional courses. In this case, conversational bot which can simulate human conversation in natural language text could act as a virtual teacher to provide answers to students whenever needed (Ong et. al., 2014).\nIn this research, MOOC-bot is developed as the conversational bot agent for the\nrole of interacting with users in MOOCs. MOOC-bot will be using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base. AIML is a well-known XML derived language which is used in case-based reasoning and textual pattern matching algorithms. AIML was developed by Dr. Richard Wallace and the Alicebot open source community among 1995 and 2000. It was designed to help in the development of ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) (Mikic et. al., 2009). As AIML is open source and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains, many conversational bots used AIML to develop their agents that communicate with users in natural language.\nMOOC-bot will be the conversational bot for the subject “MITI 5113 Artificial\nIntelligence” which is offered by Faculty of Information and Communication Technology from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). UTeM is the first technical university and one of the public universities in Malaysia. Established in year 2000, UTeM was formerly known as Kolej Universiti Teknikal Kebangsaan Malaysia (KUTKM) before being conferred university status. Currently, UTeM operates from three campuses namely the Main Campus, City Campus and the Technology Campus in Malacca with seven faculties and the blend of local and international students."

      "heading" : "1.3 Problem Statement",
      "text" : "MOOCs are a new online learning model which can accommodate massive number\nof participants. This can be seen in “Artificial Intelligence” MOOC offered by Stanford University in 2011 where it attracted 160,000 enrolments (Iqbal et. al., 2014). With usually only one instructor delivering a course, students will not be able to get full attention or help from the instructor easily when they face problems. This will end up being frustrating for the students. On the other hand, the instructors will also feel overwhelm to handle so many enquiries from students at one time. Moreover, if the same question was asked by many different students, it is inefficient for the instructor to repeat the answers many times and thus causing additional workload.\nIn addition, MOOCs are supposed to offer flexibility to students to learn at their\nown convenience because they may have full time job or any other commitments. At the same time, MOOCs are also offered to participants from worldwide which means they could be living at places with different time zone. Under such circumstances, the students’ learning hour may be different from the instructor’s working hour. As such, the students are not able to interact or getting feedback from the instructor immediately. This may\ndemotivate the learner, discourage them to ask questions or seek further clarification from the instructor.\nDue to all these problems, MOOC-bot could play the role of assistant to the\ninstructor which can respond to course-related enquiries in live chat and as frequently as needed. MOOC-bot which can provide 24-hour services also can solve the flexibility requirement needed in MOOCs. This means that the students can get response at any time needed by them as long as they are connected to the Internet."

      "text" : "This chapter reviews Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), conversational bots\nand its related topics. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of study which inspires the exploration of many useful applications using a computer or a machine and one of it is conversational bots. Conversational bots are sometimes referred as conversation robots, conversation agents, chat bot, chatter bots or simply ‘bots’ but they have the same target which is to generate meaningful conversation with human users using natural language. For this purpose, Turing test (TT) is the well-known measurement to assess the performance of a conversation bot and many parties are using TT as the assessment of conversational bots such as the Loebner Prize and Chatterbox Challenge competition though they may be the modified version of the original TT.\nThere are many types of conversational bots have been explored and developed\nover the years. They ranged from general conversational bots which do not specialized in any domain to those subject-matter expert bots. The purpose of these conversational bots can also be different; they may be developed for winning competition such as the Loebner Prize or for commercial needs such as attracting or assisting customers. This chapter also outlined the significant works in conversational bot which created impact or contribution to the development in this field. In addition, Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML)\nand Web Speech Application Programming Interface (API) which are part of MOOC-bot implementation are also further elaborated."

      "text" : "MOOCs were started in 2008 through the course, Connectivism and Connective\nKnowledge (CCK08) which was created and facilitated by George Siemens and Stephen Downes (Fini, 2009; Lowe, 2014). Since then there has been tremendous development in MOOCs with millions of dollars of grants funded the experiments of variety principles, courses, and tools in MOOCs. Until today it is still developing and there is no sign of winding down.\nMOOC is considered an education revolution as it differs from traditional course by\nallowing large enrollments of students from all over the world regardless of prior learning. Some even defined it as courses being offered free of charge to anyone who are interested to learn. However, this is still a debatable topic as there is still a need of a business model to keep MOOCs sustainable (Dellarocas and Van Alstyne, 2013; Valentin, 2014). Anyhow, MOOCs is seen as the route to cheap education which will always be attractive to the public (Lowe, 2014).\nAs far as the model is concerned, Siemen (2013) has classified three types of\nMOOCs: xMOOCs, cMOOCs, and quasi-MOOCs. xMOOCs replicate the traditional university model where the teacher plays as the expert and learners become the consumer of the knowledge. Most universities are the driving force behind this model. These include Stanford through Coursera, MIT and Harvard through edX, Udacity, and many elite American institutions. Assignments are computer-graded and direct instructor feedback is scarce in xMOOCs due to the large number of students. cMOOCs are based on\nconnectivism that attempt to group the learners to interact with each other and share their personal knowledge in order to learn together. In contrast with xMOOCs, cMOOCs is not the type of teacher-student knowledge transfer approach but more of knowledge sharing between participants. It emphasizes on autonomy on choosing what content or skills to be learnt by the participant and the openness in the activities that participant can pursue using numerous tools and technologies. CCK08 was the MOOC delivered in cMOOC format. Quasi-MOOCs are more recognized as web-based tutorials in Open Educational Resources (OER) such as those offered by the Khan Academy and MIT’s OpenCourseWare (OCW). This model which intended for OER has neither automated grading such as those in xMOOCs nor social interaction connectivity of cMOOCs, but more of a range of loosely related educational resources collected together.\nMOOCs have various advantages and challenges. Jurenas (2014) has described the\nincreased accessibility, enhanced student engagement, and lifelong learning opportunity as the advantages of MOOCs. LeCounte and Johnson (2014) opined that MOOCs provides the flexibility for working employees to train on specific skill-sets and also address skills gap problem for companies which need qualified applicants in fields such as accounting and finance, engineering, IT, etc. On the other hand, the issues that MOOCs faced are the challenges of high dropout rates, sustainability, cheating and plagiarism (Siemen, 2013). On top of these, Jurenas (2014) also included the lack of individual instruction and impact on professional life of the instructor as the additional challenges. LeCounte and Johnson (2014) were of the view that the creditability of MOOCs is questionable due to the industry standards for pedagogy and evaluation criteria, not to mention the credit transferability of MOOCs among institutions.\nThere are various arguments regarding the adoption of MOOCs with some\nsupporting it and some against it as well as those suggest for improvement. Samuels (2014) is one of those against MOOCs with the views that learners tend to multitask and not concentrate in self-paced learning which takes them twice as long to complete it if not half as good. In addition, peer grading or computer-grading which eliminate the role of teachers is seen as destroying the academic business model. Having personal experience MOOC as a participant, Kauza (2014) is not totally against MOOC but truly felt the lack of interaction with the instructor made the learning experience less fulfilling and of the opinion that MOOCs are more suitable for curious learners or certifications renewal rather as a credit-bearing higher education. The same opinion is shared by Syapin (2014) who also was not satisfied with her MOOC experience but agreed that it would help in education cost. Knox et. al. (2014) called for the engagement of participant’s feedback in MOOC to explore and refine its design. With the emergence of less than a decade, MOOCs are still not fully mature and for sure will subject to refinement and correction. At the moment, MOOCs have not stopped but could be changing direction and morphing into next big thing (Krause, 2014). This study on MOOC conversational bot also plays the role of transforming MOOC into a more interactive platform."

      "heading" : "2.3 Artificial Intelligence",
      "text" : "The term “Artificial Intelligence” (AI) was first introduced at a workshop held at\nDartmouth College in 1956 which saw the necessary to separate it from other fields of study (Russell and Norvig, 2010). AI is a branch of computer science which attempts to produce intelligent machine that could exhibit the behavior similar to human intelligence. In AI essence, it is an attempt to simulate the intelligence of human mind. According to\nRussell and Norvig (2010), AI system can be divided into four categories namely, thinking humanly, thinking rationally, acting humanly, and acting rationally as shown in Figure 2.1.\nToday AI is used in many areas. Some of the examples are natural language\nunderstanding, speech recognition, planning and scheduling, vision, robotic, game playing, and expert system. There are many achievements or successful applications in AI history. For examples, computer program Deep Blue defeated human champion in chess game (Goodman and Keene, 1997), Asimo intelligent walking robot is able to interact with human using gestures and voice (Sakagam et. al., 2002), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Mars exploration rovers, Spirit and Opportunity has autonomous navigation abilities (Mak, et. al., 2005), Google search by voice (Schalkwyk et. al., 2010), and IBM Watson defeated two human champions in America live television quiz show,\nJeopardy! (Tesauro et. al., 2012). The listings of the significant milestones in AI are summarized in Figure 2.2 chronologically.\nIn practice, the progress of AI research was made possible with the creation of\ncomputer software and hardware. The software side supplied operating systems, programming languages, tools for writing modern programs, and databases. The advances of each generation of computer hardware have increased the computer’s performance and capacity, resulted a more powerful but cheaper machine. These favorable developments have also made AI application become common and affordable to incorporate in consumer’s products such as face recognition software in camera, floor-washing and vacuum-cleaning robots, self-adjusting washing machine for better clothes washing, selfadjusting air-conditioning system according to the ambience, and many more."

      "heading" : "2.4 Turing Test, Loebner Prize and Chatterbox Challenge",
      "text" : "Alan Turing was a highly influential pioneer in computer science as well as a\nbrilliant mathematician. In 1950, through his famous article, “Computing Machinery and\nIntelligence”, he proposed a behavioral intelligence test which he called it the “Imitation Game”. His challenge on 'Can machines think?’ in the paper brought the attention on the view of machine intelligence. The test which is more well-known as the Turing test (TT) now, suggested that a computer is considered “intelligent” if a human interrogator who posed some written questions is not able distinguish whether the written responses come from a human or a computer as illustrated in Figure 2.3.\nTuring (1950) believed that in about fifty years from that time (which supposed to\nbe year 2000), computers would have achieved the storage capacity of about 109 which would see the test achieves the result of: “an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning”. However, this notion proved to be wrong because as of today, the computer’s storage have reached 1GB which he required and even exceeded that, but so far no intelligent computer program is able to achieve that level. This challenge set by Turing appeared harder than he expected.\nTT brought lasting impact and great contribution in AI but it was not without\nobjections and arguments which saw various literatures debated about it for more than half a century. Gunderson (1971), Searle (1980), Block (1981), French (1990), and Shieber (2006) have all questioned the sufficiency of TT as the criterion of intelligence which only relies on behavioral properties exhibited by a subject. Hayes and Ford (1995) argued that TT was not a sensible goal and considered it harmful to AI because AI researchers adopted it seriously as a long-range goal and motivation in the field which they think limiting AI’s sights. However, there were also researchers that defended TT such as Moor (1976) and Leiber (1995) who argued that the critics had misunderstood or misinterpreted the real value of TT.\nThe Loebner Prize is the longest running annual contest based on TT but with some\nmodification from the original TT (Shieber, 1994). Started since 1991, it was established by Dr. Hugh Loebner with the reward of $100,000 and a gold medal for the first program which able to respond indistinguishably from a human while each year the most humanlike computer will win an annual cash prize and a bronze medal (Loebner, n.d.). Shieber (1994) has criticized that the competition has no clear purpose or any useful outcome but Loebner (1994) responded by defending the need of the competition as a tool to measure the state of the art in AI. Saygin et. al. (2003) agreed that the award in Loebner Prize could influence research in AI by making people interested in creating TT-passing programs. As of to date no one has come close to winning the gold medal which is passing the unrestricted TT.\nThe Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) is another annual TT-like contest which started in\n2001. CBC has different category of awards such as ‘best personality’, ‘conversational ability’, ‘most knowledgeable’, ‘best overall’, etc. Unlike Loebner Prize which has specific\nvenue for the competition, CBC is conducted over the Internet. This has raised the question on whether human could be intervening behind the system (Vallverdú et. al., 2010; Shah and Warwick, 2010). Due to this, CBC is seen carries less weight in conversational bot benchmark. Nevertheless, CBC is still a platform to test the state-of-the-art of conversational bots and comparison of technology."

      "heading" : "2.5 Conversational Bots",
      "text" : "One of the earliest and well-known works in conversational bot was the program\ncalled ELIZA. It was developed by Weizenbaum (1966) to play the role of a psychotherapist to a patient. This research was considered a breakthrough in AI at that time because it demonstrated a form of communication between man and computer in natural language. Although ELIZA was far from passing the real TT but being able to convince the interrogator to continue the conversation with the program led people to believe that it had demonstrated the responses in a Turing-like test. Figure 2.4 shows a sample dialogue of ELIZA from Weizenbaum (1966).\nAs ELIZA was simulating a Rogerian psychotherapist, it could use the trick of\nrephrasing the patient’s statements as questions and the patient will likely to open up his/her personal problems which will make the conversation continues. Weizenbaum was surprised that his program could also deceive normal people into believing it (Saygin et. al., 2003). There were suggestions went as far to replace psychotherapists with such kind of programs so that the therapy become cheap and could be done on a larger scale (Colby et. al, 1966).\nELIZA gave the impression of being more intelligent than it actually was. It has\nneither the understanding of English nor having the mind of a psychiatrist. It was implemented using pattern recognition according to decomposition rules and keywords substitutions according to reassemble rules where both were pre-defined scripts. If a keyword or phrase could not be identified, context-free remark such as “please go on” or “does that have anything to do with” the previous topic will be used. Figure 2.5 shows the decomposition rules and reassemble rules used in ELIZA.\nInspired by ELIZA, Kenneth Mark Colby who was a psychiatrist wrote his own\nversion of program to simulate the mind of a paranoid patient in the 70’s. His model called PARRY had personality and emotional state such as ‘fear’, ‘anger’ and ‘mistrust’ which would determine its responses to the interviewer. This was done by having two separate modules, the parsing module and the interpretation-action module. The first module is used to interpret the meaning of the input in natural language and it is passed to the second module which keeps the current state of mind to decide the linguistic actions to respond (Colby, 1975).\nPARRY was tested in Turing-like test to determine whether experienced\npsychiatrists could distinguish between the program and a real human patient (Colby, 1981). The overall test results showed that psychiatric judges were unable to make the relevant distinctions between PARRY and real paranoid patients. This was due to the fact\nthat paranoid people have irrational and obsessive behavior, therefore, inappropriate responses seemed reasonable. It may be simpler to simulate paranoid behavior but there is still clever logic that made PARRY simulates effectively. Figure 2.6 shows the conversation between PARRY and a human psychiatrist where it answered well and attempted to introduce its own topic.\nInterestingly, ELIZA and PARRY were put on conversation for a demonstration in\n1973. Figure 2.7 shows part of their conversation. The beginning of their conversation was reasonable but as the conversation went on, both were trying to repeat what the other said. This would not be difficult for someone in TT to decide whether it is a program or a human.\nIn 1990 Dr. Hugh Loebner founded the Loebner Prize with the aims of promoting\nAI research and formalizing the Turing test. The competition offers the Grand Prize of $100,000 and a gold medal for the first program which able to respond indistinguishably from a human, while each year the most human-like computer will win an annual cash prize and a bronze medal. Since its inception, the competition has attracted the development of various conversational bots to win the prize each year. The winners of the Loebner Prize from 1991 to present are listed in Table 2.1. Among these winners, the notable ones are those that won more than once such as Albert One, ALICE, and Jabberwacky.\ndeveloped by Dr. Richard Wallace and won the Loebner Prize in 2000, 2001, and 2004. It was built with Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) which is a of Extensible Mark-up Language (XML)-based language. AIML was created by Dr. Richard Wallace and the Alicebot open source community between 1995 and 2000. ALICE uses simple stimulus-response technique to return matching response to the user, similar to those used by ELIZA but it has more categories of knowledge compare to ELIZA. The stimulusresponse structure of ALICE resembles Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) paradigm (Wallace, 2009). Figure 2.8 shows part of the conversation between the judge and ALICE during the Loebner Prize competition.\nALICE can be added with new responses using AIML content. This AIML content\ncan be created by the botmaster with anticipatory approach where he/she will try to guess all or most of the likely ways clients might ask the same question, or express the same statement. Another approach of creating AIML content would be based on a backwardlooking log file analysis. In this method, the botmaster will check on the logged conversations and look for \"incorrect replies\" in the dialogue. This will be followed by rewriting new categories for those queries. The backward looking approach is in accordance with Zipf's Law (Zipf, 1949) where a query uttered by a person will most likely be uttered by others again later. This will ensure that the most commonly uttered sentences are taken care of (Wallace, 2009).\nThe set of AIML scripts for ALICE has been made available for free download at\nGoogle Code. It is known as the Annotated ALICE AIML files (AAA) comprising the brain of the award winning conversation bot. The AAA files which mostly compatible with all AIML 1.0.1 enable botmasters to easily clone ALICE’s brain and thus reduce the huge\nefforts to create and edit the AIML contents (Wallace, 2011). AIML technology has spread widely due to the availability of AAA files and AIML under General Public License (GPL). Beside this, many AIML interpreters has been made available in different programming language such as Lisp, Java, PHP, Ruby, C++ and many more. Each interpreter has its own name, for example, Program D is the AIML interpreter for Java and Program O is the interpreter for PHP. Table 2.2 lists all the name of the interpreters and their programming language.\nworld market for conversational bot technology. Indeed, due to the availability of AIML under GPL, there are many conversational bot implemented based on AIML technology whether in education, government, medical, entertainment or commercial. Mahapatra et. al. (2012) created AIML-based chatter bot as interface tasks in E-Government interactive support systems with the aim to address audience who are computer illiterate. De Gasperis (2010) used AIML to build the knowledge of an Italian chatter bot. Persona-AIML (Galvao\net. al., 2004) is the architecture for developing chatter bots with personality which favors the reuse of AIML bases. Humorist Bot (Augello et. al., 2008) is an AIML conversational agent with humoristic features which was embedded as a Yahoo instant messaging contact. There are also researches which integrate AIML as part of their architecture or model. Among these works are multimodal human-robot interaction with AIML chatter bot system (Tan et. al., 2012), and Artificial Intelligent Neural-network Identity (AINI) architecture (Goh, et. al., 2007) in human-computer communication system.\nIn education field, CHAtteR Learning Interface Entity (CHARLIE) is the AIML\nchatter bot responsible for communication between the INtelligent Educational System (INES) and the students in natural language (Mikic et. al, 2009). T-Bot is the tutor bot which able to provide domain specific answers in natural language according to course contents when requested by students while Q-Bot is an evaluation bot which keep track and supervises the student progress through personalized questionnaires. Both are implemented with AIML in e-learning platform (Mikic et. al., 2008). University Faqbot (UFAQbot) is another example of AIML chat bot for education purpose. UFAQbot served as undergraduate advisor in student information desk to help students with admission and course information (Ghose and Barua, 2013).\nDespite the popularity of AIML, it is not without its limitation. For example, the\nuse of depth-first search algorithm in AIML to retrieve the responses does not optimize the results because it only finds the first available solution, and there is no spell-check function in AIML (Lu, et. al., 2006). This has prompted the researches to enhance AIML-based conversational bot. Among them is AZ-ALICE which built on ALICE Program D as the chat engine but customized with perl script that allows users to evaluate and suggest new patterns (Schumaker et. al., 2006). Intentional AIML (iAIML) is the mechanism to treat\nintention information in AIML chatter bots by incorporating intentions and rules used in sentence interpretation and generation (Neves et. al., 2006). Torrey et. al. (2006) improved their robot dialogue interaction by replacing AIML’s depth-first search with an A* search, and added priorities and a system to find the best match to a question. Weerawarna et. al. (2011) overcome weaknesses in existing AIML chatter bots by introducing new scripting language called CyberMate Scripting Language (CSL) which comes with CSL integrated development environment (IDE) to develop the scripts and CSL parser to compile CSL scripts to AIML.\nAnother Loebner Prize winner, Jabberwacky was created by British programmer\nRollo Carpenter. Jabberwacky was also using contextual pattern matching techniques but what makes it unique was that it learnt from conversation which models the way humans learn language, facts, context and rules. This makes it able to learn foreign language, slang English, word games, and jokes through conversation. Without hard-coded rules and long term memory, Jabberwacky relies entirely on the feedback from the conversation logs which it recorded for the responses. Jabberwacky’s incorporation of AI purely from conversation only suitable for general intelligence and character but not meant for business or commercial purpose. Figure 2.9 shows a snippet of conversation between Jabberwacky and a human user.\nIn commercial environment, conversational bots usually act as the virtual customer\nservice agent which able to provide 24/7 services. The benefits include offering friendly, tireless services, and the ability to answer the most common questions. Anna is an example of commercial conversational bot. She is the female virtual assistant for IKEA, the Swedish furniture retailers. Anna can be seen as a 2D animated image wearing official company’s theme of yellow shirt with blue collar at certain countries IKEA’s website. She accepts typed input and reply in text in many languages. The role of Anna is mainly to guide users in IKEA-related enquiries such as products, prices, sizes, delivery, etc. Anna will also open related pages in a browser window to facilitate user who are looking for information. There is not much information published regarding the technique used behind Anna’s creation because it is developed by a commercial company called Artificial Solutions. However, Shah and Pavlika (2005) mentioned that Anna was based on technology of Elbot which is the winner of 2008 Loebner Prize and runner up in year 2003."

      "text" : "AIML was designed by Dr. Richard Wallace and Alicebot free software community\nto create stimulus-response chat bots. It is a derivative of XML with a specific structure. As an XML-compliant language, AIML also respects the grammar specification in XML such as the syntax of comments, white space handling, end-of-line handling, the need of closing tag, and so on. An AIML file should be saved with “.aiml” extension, for example: “bot.aiml” and it must enclose “<aiml>” tag in file. The “<aiml>” tag may contain the AIML version as shown in line 1 of Figure 2.10 to avoid confusion because there is more than one version such as 1.0, 1.0.1 and the latest is 2.0 which its specification is still under draft (Wallace, 2014).\nThe basic unit of knowledge in AIML is called “category” and it is written as\n“<category>” in AIML file. Usually the more categories an AIML file has, the more knowledge it contains. Each “category” is followed with input or question known as “pattern”, written as “<pattern>” and the answer is matched with one or more output called “template” which is written as “<template>”. The AIML pattern is consisting of only of words, spaces, and the wildcard symbols ‘_’ and ‘*’. Beside this, there are two types of optional context called \"that\" (<that> tag) and \"topic\" (<topic> tag) which are part of the AIML main elements but not compulsory to be present. The “<that>” tag tells the system to refer to the last sentence presented by the chatterbot while the “<topic>” tag is used to organize subjects or topics that only applied to an active topic variable. The basic units of AIML which are mandatory in AIML file are shown in Figure 2.10.\nIn the templates, there are additional tags that can be used according to the needs of\nthe chat bot. Table 2.3 summarizes some of the commonly-used tags and their functions. In addition, AIML also supports the interface of other languages and systems. The “<system>” tag executes any program accessible as an operating system shell command, and inserts the results in the reply. On the other hand, the “<javascript>” tag allows the execution of JavaScript code inside the templates.\nAn AIML interpreter will store all the categories in a tree using Graphmaster\nobject. The goal is to make pattern matching efficient by not searching in a brute force manner. The Graphmaster works by looking for the section that matches the first letter or word and skip to another section that contains the set of the next letter or word. The process continues until the word or phrase is found. This is done with the help of a set of nodes called Nodemappers. The Nodemappers map branches from each node where the branches are either single words or wildcards. The matching steps in Graphmaster begin with matching the \"_\" listings first followed by alphabetical listings next. If no matches are found, the patterns beginning with \"*\" will be searched as shown in Figure 2.11.\nThe Graphmaster is a metaphor of a file system hierarchy whether in Windows,\nUnix or Mac system. It is analogous to a file’s path name such as \"C:\\My Documents\\My Pictures\\photo.jpg\" that represents the file’s location within the system. The AIML pattern of \"I LIKE TO *\" is equivalent to \"g:\\I\\LIKE\\TO\\star\" which start with the \"g:\\I\\\" folder followed by \"g:\\I\\LIKE\\\" subfolder that contains a single file called \"template.txt\" which is the template of AIML (Wallace, 2007)."

Speech recognition is an alternative input method which works by accepting speech input and converts them to text. Speech input has several benefits, for example, it enhances accessibility for visuallyimpaired users and offers as a hands-free input method (Adorf, 2013). On the other hand, speech synthesis is the act of transforming text to speech. Speech synthesis is incorporated in Text-to-Speech (TTS) applications to provide better user experience.\nEven though Web Speech API specification is included in HyperText Markup\nLanguage 5 (HTML5), so far only Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers supported them (Walther, 2015). One of the drawbacks of Web Speech API is user have to grant the application permission to use the microphone for speech recognition purpose. If the page is not hosted on Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), the permission needs to be granted for each utterance. This can be overcome by applying Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to the website in order to establish an encrypted link between the website and client and this will be reflected with the HTTPS uniform resource identifier (URL). By using HTTPS hosting, the user only needs to grant the permission once even if he/she returns to the website multiple times."

Prototype can be adapted to fulfill user’s requirements and at the same time the developer can have better understanding of the requirements based on the feedback. The changes and suggestions done in prototype stage can avoid sudden change after the completion of the system.\nPrototype methodology has two strategies: requirement prototype which is also\nknown as throwaway prototype, and evolutionary prototype. The development of MOOCbot would be using evolutionary prototype because instead of discarding the prototype, it will be refine to become a real system. The prototype which has been verified will be used as part of the final system. Figure 3.1 shows the activities involved in evolutionary prototype.\nBased on Figure 3.1, the first activity in prototype system development is to\nidentify the system requirements. This activity in MOOC-bot would be identifying the syllabus and lectures given in “Artificial Intelligence”. After that, the specification framework will be determined to produce MOOC-bot prototype. This prototype will be evaluated by lecturer and users repetitively until it is able to fulfill the questions of majority users. The next activity is to create the design and implement the system. After the system is completed, it will be verified to ensure that the system is perfect.\nGenerally, evolutionary prototype strategy consists of five phases as described\nbelow.

The prototype of MOOC-bot is part of the research design to provide user experience in order to assess its performance in qualitative way. The system architecture presented in this chapter is essential to build the conversational bot for MOOCs. The chat interface, knowledge base, and AIML interpreter are the most important components in MOOC-bot’s design.\nCHAPTER 4\nIMPLEMENTATION\n4.1 Introduction\nThis chapter discusses the implementation of MOOC-bot prototype. Having\nreviewed the architecture in the previous chapter, MOOC-bot will be developed based on the design which includes chat interface, knowledge base, and AIML interpreter. In order to prepare for the development, the environment needs to be setup up locally and the relevant software needs to be installed. Subsequently, the MOOC-bot’s knowledge can be built up using the interpreter’s interface. With the appropriate environment for development, the prototype can be developed and used for performance assessment in the next chapter.\n4.2 Software Installation\nMOOC-bot is a web-based conversational bot using Program O interpreter.\nProgram O is an AIML interpreter written in PHP and uses MySQL database to store the data. In order to create server-client environment in development’s computer, Apache web server needs to be installed. WampServer package which is free for download at its website provides the convenience of automatically create Apache, PHP and MySQL database in Windows when installed. It also comes with PhpMyAdmin tool to manage the MySQL\ndatabase conveniently. Program O which was first released in 2009 can also be freely downloaded from the Internet. The following sections explain the installation steps of WampServer and Program O.\n4.2.1 WampServer Installation\nAt WampServer’s website (http://www.wampserver.com/en), there are two versions\nof Windows installers available for download, 32-bits and 64-bits as shown in Figure 4.1.\nAfter downloaded the suitable installer, run it to start the installation process and\nfollow the steps below: i) When the installation screen appeared, click ‘Next’ button to proceed as shown in Figure 4.2.\nii) Read the license agreement that appears on the screen and select ‘I accept the\nagreement’ then click ‘Next’ button as shown in Figure 4.3 to continue.\niii) The default path to install WampServer is “c:\\wamp”. Choose the desire path\nand click ‘Next’ as shown in Figure 4.4.\niv) Choose the preference of whether to add Quick Launch icon and Desktop icon for WampServer then click ‘Next’ button as shown in Figure 4.5.\nv) After confirm all the selections, click ‘Install’ button to begin the installation as shown in Figure 4.6.\nvi) The installation will begin to run as shown in Figure 4.7.\nvii) After successful installation, the screen as shown in Figure 4.8 will appear\nand WampServer is ready to be used.\nviii) WampServer can be launched from the Start Menu, Desktop icon or Quick\nLaunch icon (if Desktop icon or Quick Launch icon were selected at Step iv) as\nshown in Figure 4.9.\n4.2.2 Program O Installation\nProgram O can be downloaded at https://github.com/Program-O/Program-O. After\ndownloaded the program, the folder can be renamed to desire name, for example “Bot”. Subsequently the “Bot” folder can be placed at the server’s path such “c:\\wamp\\www”\nwhich is the path for local Apache web server and it can be accessed using “localhost/Bot” address.\nIn order to allow Program O to use MySQL database, an empty database needs to\nbe created upfront. This can be done easily using PhpMyAdmin tool which comes together with WampServer’s installation. PhpMyAdmin can be accessed from “http://localhost/phpmyadmin/” as shown in Figure 4.10.\nNew database can be created conveniently by entering the database’s name and\npress the ‘Create’ button as shown in Figure 4.11.\nAfter that, new user and password for that database with full permissions need to be\ncreated so that Program O can access with that credential. A new user can be added by clicking the “Add a new User” link as shown in Figure 4.12.\nAfter filling the necessary information such as user’s name and password, press\n‘Go’ button to complete the new user adding process as shown in Figure 4.13.\nNext, complete Program O’s installation by accessing the program’s site. For local\npath, it can be accessed from “localhost/Bot” using Internet browser such as Google Chrome. Program O will automatically direct the page to “localhost/bot/install/install_programo.php” as shown in Figure 4.14 which needs to be\nfilled up. There is a “Help Page” link to explain the meaning for each field. The information of the database which was created in the previous step needs to be used to fill up the Database Configuration portion.\nAfter filled-in all the fields, click the ‘Save’ button to complete the installation. The\ninstallation completed page as shown in Figure 4.15 will appear to indicate successful installation. The installation page will not appear again the next time when accessing “localhost/Bot” because the configuration file has been overwritten after the installation completed.\nAfter the installation completed, accessing “localhost/bot” will direct the page to\nProgram O’s chat interface which is shown in Figure 4.16. From here the queries can be tested by entering text into the text box and press the ‘Say’ button. The responses will be retrieved from the knowledge base and displayed on the screen."

For FAQ knowledge, the responses can be added from time to time by studying the conversation logs. As for general knowledge, Annotated ALICE AIML (AAA) files from ALICE AI Foundation provide the convenience of cloning their general knowledge into MOOC-bot. More general knowledge which does not exist in AAA files will also be added to make MOOC-bot more intelligent in handling general questions.\nThere are two methods to add knowledge to the knowledge base. Firstly, the\nknowledge can be directly typed at the user interface provided by Program O under the teaching function. To access the teaching function, a user must login as administrator first. The user name and password for administrator was the one created during the installation process as shown in Figure 4.14. Figure 4.17 shows the administrator login page for Program O. It can be accessed from “localhost/bot/admin/”.\nAfter successfully login, click at ‘Teach’ menu on the left hand side of the page.\nEnter the user input and bot response then click ‘teach’ button in order to save it to knowledge base as show in Figure 4.18.\nThe second method involves writing the knowledge in AIML file and uploads it\nusing Program O’s user interface. The advantage of using this method is many entries can be added at once and uploaded together. However, all the entries’ format must be correctly written in AIML format, otherwise the entire upload of the file will fail when attempt to upload. AIML format is an XML-based format using specific tags such as “<aiml>”, “<category>”, “<pattern>”, “<template>” and many more. Just like any XML tag, every tag must be in pair which are the opening and closing tags and written with the same case to ensure their validity. An AIML file can be created using any text editor such as Notepad++ and saved with “.aiml” extension. Figure 4.19 shows an example of AIML file in Notepad++.\nAfter the AIML file is written, it can be uploaded to knowledge base through the\n‘Upload AIML’ menu in Program O’s administrator page. At the page, click the ‘Choose File’ button to select the file, followed by clicking the ‘upload’ button to upload the\ncontent as shown in Figure 4.20. If the AIML file has missing, mismatch or unrecognized tags, error messages will be shown and the file needs to be corrected."

Both of them are currently only supported in Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers (Walther, 2015). Figure 4.22 shows the code snippets for speech recognition and Figure 4.23 shows the code snippets for speech synthesis used in MOOC-bot.\nFrom the chat interface, MOOC-bot is able to provide interactivity in three ways.\nFirstly, MOOC-bot can reply with a hyperlink in the chat interface which allows the user to choose whether to open the page or not as shown in Figure 4.24.\nIn the second method, MOOC-bot can response by opening a new Window to\ndisplay the search results as shown in Figure 4.25. This can be used when searching for images and video, Wiki and dictionary.\nLastly, MOOC-bot can response by navigating to the relevant page to show the\ninformation queried by the user as shown in Figure 4.26.

In this study, black-box approach is used to evaluate the responses given by MOOC-bot. The datasets selected need to be from conversational bot-related sources. Hence, the past competition questions in Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize are chosen as the datasets. The measurement of the results is also based on CBC’s guidelines to determine the scoring.\n5.2 Approach\nBlack-box approach which is qualitative assessment has been chosen to evaluate\nMOOC-bot. Black-box approach focuses on the output generated in response to the given input without concern with the internal processing. This approach suits the nature of MOOC-bot well because the core function of MOOC-bot is to deliver appropriate answers to users in order to overcome some of the problems in MOOC such as lack of interactivity as stated in Chapter 1. Furthermore, black-box approach has been used by other researchers in question-answering system whether in open domain (Nyberg and\nMitamura, 2002) or restricted domain (Diekema et. al., 2004) as well as for conversational bots (Goh et. al., 2007; Preez et. al., 2009). Turing test which has high regard in this field is also a black-box approach (Floridi, 2003)."

How about you? 8\nFrom the results shown in Table 5.4, MOOC-bot was able to score 562 points out\nof 800 points. The scores are grouped according to the frequency so that trend can be observed in Table 5.5 and Figure 5.2.\nFrom the table and chart shown in Table 5.5 and Figure 5.2 respectively, it can be\nseen that the majority of the dataset results fall at 6-point and 8-point score. This means that MOOC-bot was able to provide correct answers at most of the time during the test and some even with creative answers. Out of the hundred questions, 95 percent of the answers are in categories of 8-point to 2-point. This shows that MOOC-bot was able to response appropriately by at least giving some relevant answers. However, the existence of 0-point results means that there are still some questions ended up with irrelevant responses. In this case, MOOC-bot still needs to be further improved in the future.\nIn overall, MOOC-bot displayed its capability to bring up topic to prolong the\nconversation. For example, answers such as ‘My favorite movie is Terminator. Have you seen Terminator?’, ‘My home is cyberspace. How about you?’, and ‘I don't think I ever have entered any contests. What's entered any contests like?’ encourage the user to continue the conversation. Beside this, MOOC-bot also showed the ability to generate random answers which are relevant to the question. This is demonstrated in the example of repeating the same statement ‘I like ice cream!’ for four times and each time the response was different.\nMOOC-bot which has the capability of speech synthesis and speech recognition\nwas able to accept speech input and present the response in text and speech. However, the need to grant the application permission to use the microphone after every pause could deter user from using it. Furthermore, the voice input must be pronouced precisely and not too fast in order for MOOC-bot to capture the words correctly. The improvement in this area would depend on the Web Speech API provided by the browser and in this case is Google Chrome."

      "heading" : "5.6 Summary",
      "text" : "This chapter saw the evaluation of MOOC-bot being conducted using one hundred\ndatasets compiled from past competition questions of Loebner Prize and Chatterbot Challenge. The evaluation is done using the black-box approach which completely relied on the outputs generated and in this case are MOOC-bot’s responses. From the results gathered, it can be seen that MOOC-bot was able to provide correct answers at most of the time and only small percentage of 5 percent having unrelated responses.\nIn terms of the objectives of this study, the evaluation saw MOOC-bot\ndemonstrated the success of achieving the three objectives stated in Chapter 1 which are to i) synthesize the questions posed by the users using text or speech input, ii) providing answers to questions in text and speech, and iii) deliver appropriate answers and prolong the conversation with the users.\nCHAPTER 6\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n6.1 Introduction\nThis study has reviewed the past literatures and presented architecture of\nconversational bot which can serve in Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). Subsequently, a prototype of MOOC-bot was developed and evaluated to gauge its performance. This chapter gives the summary of the research, advantages, limitations, conclusion, and the future work of the study.\n6.2 Summary of Research\nIn recent years, MOOCs has gain popularity due to its convenience and flexibility.\nNevertheless, the deliveries of MOOCs are not without its own challenges such as overwhelming student-instructor ratio and the lack of interactivity between student and instructor. These has brought conversational bot into the picture to play the role of assistant to the instructor which can respond in live chat and as frequently as needed. In this research, a prototype named MOOC-bot is developed as the conversational bot agent for the subject “MITI 5113 Artificial Intelligence” offered by Faculty of Information and Communication Technology from Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM).\nHaving reviewed the past literatures, Artificial Intelligence Markup Language\n(AIML) which is open source and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains is chosen as the knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface and MOOCs website to form the system architecture of MOOC-bot. The evaluation of MOOC-bot was done based on the datasets selected from conversational bot-related sources: the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize.\nThe outcome showed promising results with the score of 562 points out of 800\npoints which saw MOOC-bot able to provide correct answers at most of the time during the test. In addition, MOOC-bot also demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation by posing questions which encouraged the user to reply. Last but not least, MOOC-bot was able to accept input in both text and speech, and also present the answers in both ways. In overall, the evaluation saw MOOC-bot demonstrated the success of achieving the three objectives stated in Chapter 1.\n6.3 Advantages\nAs a conversational bot, MOOC-bot has the advantage of repeating the answers for\nthe same questions without getting tired or fed up. This is very much needed in MOOCs situation where the students are massive in number and the possibility of encountering the same questions is very high especially for questions related to the courses. These questions can be categorized as frequent asked questions (FAQ) and added to the knowledge base from time to time when the need arises.\nThe ability of MOOC-bot to provide 24-hour service is also another advantage in\nMOOCs because the participants come from all over the world which may have different time zones. With 24-hour service, MOOC-bot is able to provide instant responses to the\nuser regardless of the rest day or time of the course’s instructor which also includes weekends, leaves, and public holidays. This advantage benefitted MOOCs by improving the interactivity for the courses.\nThe ability to add knowledge into MOOC-bot’s knowledge base provided the\npossibility of conversational bot to support as many courses as possible in MOOCs. Furthermore, the knowledge is not limited to domain-restricted area and can also be in general knowledge. Apart from this, a single conversational bot can have knowledge in multiple domains. Under this situation, the conversational bot acts as single bot serving multiple domains. Alternatively, restricting one conversational bot with only one domain knowledge can also be implemented in order to keep the knowledge simple for maintenance. A single-domain bot can also be shared and used by multiple sites at the same time."

      "heading" : "6.4 Limitations",
      "text" : "MOOC-bot depends on the technology provided by third party such as Program O\nas the AIML interpreter and Web Speech API for speech recognition and speech synthesis. Therefore, any bugs or limitation in these programs will also be reflected on MOOC-bot. Among the shortcomings of Program O detected throughout the development is sometimes the usage of punctuation marks in the queries may affect the results that being returned. For Web Speech API, it is only supported by Google Chrome and Apple Safari browsers currently. Beside this, the need to grant permission for the application to use the microphone for speech recognition after every pause could deter user from using it. Nevertheless, this can be solved by applying Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) on the website which will reduce the permission granting to one time only."
    }, {
      "heading" : "6.5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This research has demonstrated a conversational bot in a MOOC using AIML. The\nevaluation results have shown that MOOC-bot has great potential being a conversation bot that can interact with end users. Even though the knowledge in this study is limited to only a single course, more courses can be added in future to serve a wider range of courses in MOOCs. The advantages of MOOC-bot such as able to provide 24-hour service that can serve different time zones, able to have knowledge in multiple domains, and one conversational bot can be shared by multiple sites simultaneously have outweighed its existing limitations which are mainly due to external factors."

      "heading" : "6.6 Future Work",
      "text" : "Conversational bot has great potential to be implemented for different area in\neducation field. One of the examples is to provide tutor service in MOOCs to help students in their learning process. For instance, the conversational bot can guide students when doing exercises or quizzes by providing explanation whenever needed. As for the limitation of speech recognition in this research, other technology which does not relied on browser type can be explored to achieve better results."

Since then there has been tremendous development in MOOCs with millions of dollars of grants funded the experiments of variety principles, courses, and tools in MOOCs. Until today it is still developing and there is no sign of winding down. MOOC is considered an education revolution as it differs from traditional course by allowing large enrollments of students from all over the world regardless of prior learning. Some even defined it as courses being offered free of charge to anyone who are interested to learn. However, this is still a debatable topic as there is still a need of a business model to keep MOOCs sustainable (Dellarocas and Van Alstyne, 2013; Valentin, 2014). Anyhow, MOOCs is seen as the route to cheap education which will always be attractive to the public (Lowe, 2014). As far as the model is concerned, Siemen (2013) has classified three types of MOOCs: xMOOCs, cMOOCs, and quasi-MOOCs.",

One of the issues in MOOCs which is the lack of interactivity with the instructor has brought conversational bot into the picture to fill in this gap. In this study, a prototype of MOOCs conversational bot, MOOC-bot is being developed and integrated into MOOCs website to respond to the learner’s enquiries using text or speech input. MOOC-bot is using the popular Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to develop its knowledge base, leverage from AIML’s capability to deliver appropriate responses and can be quickly adapted to new knowledge domains. The system architecture of MOOC-bot consists of knowledge base along with AIML interpreter, chat interface, MOOCs website and Web Speech API to provide speech recognition and speech synthesis capability. The initial MOOC-bot prototype has the general knowledge from the past Loebner Prize winner ALICE, course’s frequent asked questions, and a course’s content offered by Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM). The evaluation of MOOC-bot based on the past competition questions from Chatterbox Challenge (CBC) and Loebner Prize has shown that it was able to provide correct answers most of the time during the test and demonstrated the capability to prolong the conversation. The advantages of MOOCbot such as able to provide 24-hour service that can serve different time zones, able to have knowledge in multiple domains, and can be shared by multiple sites simultaneously have outweighed its existing limitations.",
