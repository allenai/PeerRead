      "text" : "Some decisions are easier to make than others—for example, large, unoccluded objects are easier to recognize. Additionally, different difficult decisions may require different expertise—an avid birder may know very little about identifying cars. We hypothesize that complex decision-making tasks like visual classification can be meaningfully divided into specialized subtasks, and that a system designed to perform a complex task should first attempt to identify the subtask being presented to it, then use that information to select the most suitable algorithm for its solution.\nThis approach—dynamically routing signals through an inference system, based on their content—has already been incorporated into machine vision pipelines via methods such as boosting (Viola et al., 2005), coarse-to-fine cascades (Zhou et al., 2013), and random decision forests (Ho, 1995). Dynamic routing is also performed in the primate visual system: spatial information is processed somewhat separately from object identity information (Goodale & Milner, 1992), and faces and other behaviorally-relevant stimuli ellicit responses in anatomically distinct, specialized regions (Moeller et al., 2008; Kornblith et al., 2013).\n1California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA. Correspondence to: Mason McGill <mmcgill@caltech.edu>.\nHowever, state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) for visual inference are routed statically (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; He et al., 2016; Dosovitskiy et al., 2015; Newell et al., 2016); every input triggers an identical sequence of operations.\nWith this in mind, we propose a mechanism for introducing cascaded evaluation to arbitrary feedforward ANNs, focusing on the task of object recognition as a proof of concept. Instead of classifying images only at the final layer, every layer in the network attempts to classify images in lowambiguity regions of its input space—clusters of instances of a single class that are linearly separable from almost all instances of other classes—while passing ambiguous images forward to subsequent layers for further consideration (see Fig. 1 for an illustration). We propose three approaches to training these networks, test them on small image datasets synthesized from MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) and CIFAR-10 (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009), and quantify the accuracy/efficiency trade-off that occurs when the network parameters are tuned to yield more aggressive early classification policies. Additionally, we propose and evaluate methods for appropriating regularization and optimization techniques developed for statically-routed networks."

More recently, Kontschieder et al. (2015) performed joint optimization of ANN and decision tree parameters, and Bulo & Kontschieder (2014) used randomized multi-layer networks to compute decision tree split functions.\nTo our knowledge, the family of inference systems we discuss was first described by Denoyer & Gallinari (2014). Additionally, Bengio et al. (2015) explored dynamically skipping layers in neural networks, and Ioannou et al. (2016) explored dynamic routing in networks with equallength paths. Some recently-developed visual detection systems perform cascaded evaluation of convolutional neural network layers (Li et al., 2015; Cai et al., 2015; Girshick, 2015; Ren et al., 2015); though highly specialized for the task of visual detection, these modifications can radically improve efficiency.\nWhile these approaches lend evidence that dynamic routing can be effective, they either ignore the cost of computation, or do not represent it explicitly, and instead use opaque heuristics to trade accuracy for efficiency. We build on this foundation by deriving training procedures from arbitrary application-provided costs of error and computation, comparing one actor-style and two critic-style strategies, and considering regularization and optimization in the context of dynamically-routed networks."

The output feature vector is then used as the input to the following layer (which we’ll refer to as the current layer’s sink), if it exists, or as the ouptut of the network as a whole, if it does not.\nWe consider networks in which layers may have more than one sink. In such a network, for every n-way junction j a signal reaches, the network must make a decision, dj ∈ {0..n}, such that the signal will propagate through the ith sink if and only if dj = i (this is illustrated in Fig. 2). We compute dj as the argmax of the score vector sj , a learned function of the last feature vector computed before reaching j. We’ll refer to this rule for generating d from s as the inference routing policy."

It is unreasonable to expect that this kind of feature vector can explicitly encode the global information relevant to deciding how to route the entire signal (e.g., in the case of object recognition, whether the image was taken indoors, whether the image contains an animal, or the prevalence of occlusion in the scene).\nTo address this, instead of computing a 2-dimensional array of local features at each layer, we compute a pyramid of features (resembling the pyramids described by Ke et al. (2016)), with local descriptors at the bottom and global descriptors at the top. At every junction j, the score vector sj is computed by a small routing network operating on the last-computed global descriptor. Our multipath architecture is illustrated in Fig. 3."

However, if such a term affects layers in a way that is independent of the amount of signal routed through them, it will either underconstrain frequently-used layers or overconstrain infrequently-used layers. To support both frequently- and infrequently-used layers, we regularize subnetworks as they are activated by d̂, instead of regularizing the entire network directly.\nFor example, to apply L2 regularization to critic networks, we define cmod:\ncmod = E [ kL2\n∑ w∈W w2\n] , (9)\nwhere W is the set of weights associated with the layers activated by d̂, and kL2 is a scalar hyperparameter.\nFor actor networks, we apply an extra term to control the magnitude of s, and therefore the extent to which the net explores subpotimal paths:\ncmod = E kL2 ∑ w∈W w2 + kdec ∑ j∈J ‖sj‖2  , (10) where kdec is a scalar hyperparameter indicating the relative cost of decisiveness.\ncmod is added to the loss function in all of our experiments.

With this setup, if we use a constant learning rate for every layer in the network, then layers through which the policy routes examples more frequently will receive larger parameter updates, since they contribute more to the expected cost.\nTo allow every layer to learn as quickly as possible, we scale the learning rate of each layer ` dynamically, by a factor α`, such that the elementwise variance of the loss gradient with respect to `’s parameters is independent of the amount of probability density routed through it.\nTo derive α`, we consider an alternative routing policy, d∗` , that routes all signals though `, then routes through subse-\nquent layers based on d̂. With this policy, at every training interation, mini-batch stochastic gradient descent shifts the parameters associated with layer ` by a vector δ∗` , defined:\nδ∗` = −λ ∑ i gi`, (11)\nwhere λ is the global learning rate and gi` is the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters in `, for training example i, under d∗` . Analogously, the scaled parameter adjustment under d̂ can be written\nδ` = −α`λ ∑ i pi`g i `, (12)\nwhere pi` is the probability with which d̂ routes example i through `.\nWe want to select α` such that\nVar(δ`) = Var(δ ∗ ` ). (13)\nSubstituting the definitions of δ` and δ∗` ,\nVar ( α` ∑ i pi`g i ` ) = Var (∑ i gi` ) . (14)\nSince every gi` is sampled independently, we can rewrite this equation:\nnexv`α 2 `‖p`‖2 = nexv`, (15)\nwhere nex is the number of training examples in the minibatch, and v` is the elementwise variance of gi`, for any i (since every example is sampled via the same mechanism). We can now show that\nα` = ‖p`‖−1. (16)\nSo, for every layer `, we can scale the learning rate by ‖p`‖−1, and the variance of the weight updates will be similar thoughout the network.

Our dataset includes the classes “0”, “1”, “2”, “3”, and “4” from MNIST and “airplane”, “automobile”, “deer”, “horse”, and “frog” from CIFAR-10 (see Fig. 4). The images from MNIST are resized to match the scale of images from CIFAR-10 (32×32), via linear interpolation, and are colormodulated to make them more difficult to trivially distinguish from CIFAR-10 images (MNIST is a grayscale dataset).\nFor a given computational budget, dynamically-routed networks achieve higher accuracy rates than architecturematched statically-routed baselines (networks composed of the first n columns of the architecture illustrated in Fig. 3, for n ∈ {1..8}). Additionally, dynamically-routed networks tend to avoid routing data along deep paths at the beginning of training (see Fig. 8). This is possibly because the error surfaces of deeper networks are more complicated, or because deeper paths are less stable—changing the parameters in any component layer to better classifying images routed along other, overlapping paths may decrease performance. Whatever the mechanism, this tendency to initially find simpler solutions seems to prevent some of the overfitting that occurs with 7- and 8-layer statically-routed networks.\nCompared to other dynamically-routed networks, optimistic critic networks perform poorly, possibly because optimal routers are a poor approximation for our small, lowcapacity router networks. Actor networks perform better than critic networks, possibly because critic networks are forced to learn a potentially-intractable auxilliary task (i.e. it’s easier to decide who to call to fix your printer than it is to predict exactly how quickly and effectively everyone you know would fix it). Actor networks also consistently achieve higher peak accuracy rates than comparable statically-routed networks, across experiments.\n4 8\n40k\n80k\nE p\no ch\nIn d\nex\nkcpt = 0\n4 8\nkcpt = 1×10−9\n4 8\nkcpt = 2×10−9\n4 8\nkcpt = 4×10−9\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nLayer Index\nFigure 8.

Since critic networks don’t require E[cinf(ν, d̂)] to be a differentiable function of d̂, they can be trained by sampling d̂, saving memory, and they support a wider selection of training routing policies (e.g. -greedy) and cinf definitions. In addition to training the standard critic networks, we train networks using a variant of the pragmatic critic training policy, in which we replace\nthe cross-entropy error in the ccre term with the classification error. Although these networks do not perform as well as the original pragmatic critic networks, they still outperform comparable statically-routed networks."

Even without energy contraints, terminal layers specialize in detecting instances of certain classes of images.

Additionally, despite their higher capacity, dynamically-routed networks may be less prone to overfitting.\nWhen designing a multipath architecture, we suggest supporting early decision-making wherever possible, since cheap, simple routing networks seem to work well. In convolutional architectures, pyramidal layers appear to be reasonable sites for branching.\nThe actor strategy described in section 4.1 is generally an effective way to learn a routing policy. However, the pragmatic critic strategy described in section 4.2 may be better suited for very large networks (trained via decision sampling to conserve memory) or networks designed for applications with nonsmooth cost-of-inference functions—e.g. one in which kcpt has units errors/operation. Adjusting learning rates to compensate for throughput variations, as described in section 4.5, may improve the performance of deep networks. If the cost of computation is dynamic, a single network, trained with the procedure described in section 5.5, may still be sufficient.\nWhile we test our approach on tasks with some degree of difficulty variation, it is possible that dynamic routing is even more advantageous when performing more complex tasks. For example, video annotation may require specialized modules to recognize locations, objects, faces, human actions, and other scene components or attributes, but having every module constantly operating may be extremely inefficient. A dynamic routing policy could fuse these modules, allowing them to share common components, and activating specialized components as necessary.\nAnother interesting topic for future research is growing and shrinking dynamically-routed networks during training. With such a network, it is not necessary to specify an architecture. The network will instead take shape over the course of training, as computational contraints, memory contraints, and the data dictate."
