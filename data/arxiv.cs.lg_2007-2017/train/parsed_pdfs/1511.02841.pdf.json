      "text" : "Generating plausible but unseen previously observations appears, at least chronologically, to have been one of the hardest challenges for artificial neural nets. A generative net can “dream-up” new observations {x̂ν}, each a vector in a high-dimensional space RN , by sampling from a white noise probability density p(z). This model density resides on a preferably low-dimensional space of latent variables z = {z(κ)}Nlatκ=1 . In order to create plausible new observations, the latent manifold has to encode the complexity of the set of P training observations {xµ}Pµ=1 ⊂ RN . Generativity has a lot more to it than “dreaming-up” new random observations. It is at the heart of the control skills of a neural net. Visual biological nets, for example, capture existential motor information like location/shape and other attributes of an object and can act on it by moving or modifying it deterministically. Asking for this data compression to be as compact and low-dimensional as possible is therefore not only a general minimalist requirement. Learning and mastering control is a gradual process, which naturally starts by seeking and exploring only a few degrees of freedom.\nMoreover, the ability to modify an object implies an ability to first and foremost reconstruct it, with various degrees of precision. Not unlike human creativity, a fully generative net has to balance out and minimize terms with non-compatible objectives: a) a generative error term, which is responsible for converting random noise into plausible data, on the one hand, and b) a reconstruction error term which is responsible for meticulous reconstruction of existing objects, on the other."

      "text" : "From the recent crop of generative nets, section 2, only one appears to offer this desirable reconstruction via a low-dimensional latent manifold: the variational auto-encoders (VAE) Kingma & Welling (2014), Rezende et al. (2014). Their subset called Gibbs machines, has also far-reaching roots into information geometry and thermodynamics, which come in very handy. They perform well on idealized visual data sets like MNIST LeCun et al. (1998). Unfortunately, like the other generative nets, they do not cope well with more realistic images, when objects are spatially varied or, if there is heavy clutter in the background. These traits are simulated in the rotated-translated-scaled (RTS)\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n02 84\n1v 3\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 8\nA pr\n2 01\n6\nMNIST and translated-cluttered (TC) MNIST, Appendix B. We highlight the shortcomings of basic generative nets on Figure 1, for the simplest case of one-dimensional latent manifold per class. While simulating wonderfully on the original MNIST (top-left), even with Nlat = 1, the net fails miserably to learn the distorted data: The randomly “dreamed-up” samples {x̂ν} are blurred and not plausible (top-right and bottom). Low latent dimensionality is not the culprit: latent manifolds with dimensions Nlat ≥ 100 do not yield much better results.\nFor the real-life CIFAR10 dataset, Krizhevsky (2009), the latent two-dimensional1 manifold of the class of horses, produced by the same architecture, is on the left of Figure 3. The training dataset has horses of different colors, facing both left and right, so the latent manifold tends to produce two-headed vague shapes of different colors."

      "text" : "In order to get the horses back, we invoke the Gibbs thermodynamic framework. It allows adding non-energy attributes to the sampling distribution and modifying them, randomly or deterministically. These symmetry statistics, like location, size, angle, color etc, are factored-out at the start and factored back-in at the end. The auto-classifier-encoder (ACE) net with symmetry statistics was suggested in Georgiev (2015) and detailed in section 4 here. The latent manifolds it produces, for the above three MNIST datasets, are on Figure 2: With distortions and clutter factored out, the quotient one-dimensional latent manifold is clear and legible. The factorization is via transformations from the affine group Aff(2,R), which plays the role of the gauge group in field theory. The spatial symmetry statistics are the transformations parameters, computed via another optimizer net. The CIFAR10 horse class manifold, generated by ACE with spatial symmetry statistics, is on the right of Figure 3. We have horse-like creatures, which morph into giraffes as one moves up the grid!\nThe first successful application of Lie algebra symmetries to neural nets was in Simard et al. (2000). The recent crop of spatial attention nets Jadeberg et al. (2015), Gregor et al. (2015), Sermanet et al.\n1The color scheme “appropriates” at least one latent dimension, hence the need for more dimensions. 2Shakespeare (1592)\n(2014), Ba et al. (2014) optimize spatial symmetry statistics, corresponding to a given object inside an observation. An efficient calculation of symmetry statistics, for multiple objects, requires a classifier. Hence, generation and reconstruction on real-life datasets lead to an auto-encoder/classifier combo like ACE. Supplementing auto-encoders with affine transforms was first proposed in Hinton et al. (2011), where spatial symmetry statistics were referred to as “capsules”. As suggested there, hundreds and thousands of capsules can in principle be attached to feature maps. Current attention\nnets produce one set of symmetry statistics per object (inside an observation). Incorporating convolutional feature maps in the encoder, and sampling from symmetry statistics at various depths, is yet to be engineered well for deep generative nets, see open problems 1, 2, section 5. Results from a shallow convolutional ACE are on Figure 4.\nSpatial symmetry statistics are vital in biological nets and can in principle be traced down experimentally. Feedback loops for attention data, vaguely reminiscent of Figure 5, have been identified between higher- and lower-level visual areas of the brain, Sherman (2005), Buffalo et al. (2010).\nFor colored images, one also needs the color symmetry statistics, forming a semigroup of nonnegative 3x3 matrices in the stochastic group3 S(3,R). As shown on the right of Figure 4, they help subdue the background color, and perhaps, more. In particle physics parlance, three-dimensional color images are described by chromodynamics with a minimum gauge group Aff(3,R)× S(3,R). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 briefly overviews recent generative nets and details VAE-s objective function; section 3 outlines the theoretical framework of generative nets with control, highlighting the connections with information geometry and thermodynamics; section 4 presents the enhanced ACE architecture; the Appendices offer implementation and dataset details."

      "heading" : "2 GENERATIVE NETS AND THE LATENT MANIFOLD.",
      "text" : "Latent manifold learning was pioneered for modern nets in Rifai et al. (2012). When a latent sample zν is chosen from a model density p(z), a generative net decodes it into a simulated observation x̂ν , from a corresponding model density q(x̂). There are two scenarios:\na) the net has reconstruction capabilities, hence q(x) can in theory be evaluated on the training and testing observations {xµ}. The objective is to minimize the so-called cross-entropy or negative log-likelihood, i.e., the expectation E(− log q(x))r(x), where E()r() is an expectation with respect to the empirical density r(). Recently proposed reconstructive generative nets are: i) the generalized denoising auto-encoders (DAE) Bengio et al. (2013), ii) the generative stochastic networks (GSN) Bengio et al. (2014), iii) the variational auto-encoders introduced above, iv) the non-linear independent component estimation (NICE) Dinh et al. (2014), and v) Sohl-Dickstein et al. (2015). Except\n3The subgroup of matrices ∈ GL(3,R), with entries in each row adding up to one, Poole (1995).\nfor NICE, the log-likelihood can not be exactly evaluated in practice, and is hence approximated. The first two models proxy q(x) with a certain conditional density q(x|x̃) and a Markov chain for the corrupted data x̃. The variational auto-encoders proxy the negative log-likelihood by a variational upper bound U(− log q(x)). Method v) conjures up a forward diffusion process from q(x) to p(z) and uses the backward diffusion process to “dream-up” new observations {x̂ν}. b) the net has no reconstruction capabilities, hence one has to resort to an interpolation q(x̂) → q̂(x), in order to evaluate q() on the training and testing observations {xµ}. The objective is to minimize directly or indirectly the negative log-likelihood E(− log q̂(x))r(x). Recent such model is the generative adversarial network (GAN) Goodfellow et al. (2014). It minimizes indirectly the above negative log-likelihood by combining a generative and a discriminative net, the latter tasked with distinguishing between the “dreamed-up” observations {x̂ν} and training observations {xµ}. Of these models, only the variational auto-encoders and the generative adversarial networks are designed to handle a low-dimensional latent manifold. As argued in sub-section 1.1, reconstruction, i.e. scenario a), is an indispensable part of the control skill set, hence we are left with the variational auto-encoder approach. As all generative nets, variational auto-encoders work in two regimes:\n• creative regime, with no data clamped onto the net and sampling from p(z), and • non-creative regime, with the training or testing observations {xµ} fed to the input layer\nof the net. Variational auto-encoders sample in this regime from a different closed-form conditional posterior model density p(z|xµ).\nIn order to do reconstruction, variational auto-encoders also introduce a conditional model reconstruction density prec(xµ|z). In non-creative regime, the reconstruction error at the output layer of the net is the expectation E(− log prec(xµ|z))p(z|xµ). In the creative regime, we have a joint model density p(xµ, z) := prec(xµ|z)p(z). The data model density q(xµ) is the implied marginal:\nq(xµ) = ∫ p(xµ, z)dz = p(xµ, z)\nq(z|xµ) , (2.1)\nfor some implied posterior conditional density q(z|xµ) which is generally intractable, q(z|xµ) 6= p(z|xµ). The full decomposition of our minimization target - the negative log-likelihood − log q(xµ) - is easily derived via the Bayes rules, Georgiev (2015), section 3:\n− log q(xµ) = E(− log prec(xµ|z))p(z|xµ)︸ ︷︷ ︸ reconstruction error +D(p(z|xµ)||p(z))︸ ︷︷ ︸ generative error −D(p(z|xµ)||q(z|xµ))︸ ︷︷ ︸ variational error , (2.2)\nwhere D(||) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The reconstruction error measures the negative likelihood of getting xµ back, after the transformations and randomness inside the net. The generative error is the divergence between the generative densities in the non-creative and creative regimes. The variational error is an approximation error: it is the price variational auto-encoders pay for having a tractable generative density p(z|xµ) in the non-creative regime. It is hard to compute, although some strides have been made, Rezende & Mohamed (2015). For the Gibbs machines discussed below, it was conjectured that this error can be made arbitrary small, Georgiev (2015)."

      "heading" : "3 THE THEORY. CONNECTIONS WITH INFORMATION GEOMETRY AND THERMODYNAMICS.",
      "text" : "A theoretical framework for universal nets was recently outlined in Georgiev (2015). Some of the constructs there, like the ACE architecture, appeared optional and driven solely by requirements for universality. We summarize and generalize the framework in the current context and argue that the ACE architecture, or its variations, are indispensable for generative reconstructive nets.\n1. Information geometry and Gibbs machines: the minimization of the generative error in (2.2) leads to sampling from Gibbs a.k.a. exponential class of densities. It follows from the probabilistic or variational Pythagorean theorem, Chentsov (1968), which underlies modern estimation theory, and is pervasive in information geometry, Amari & Nagaoka\n(2000). In the case of Laplacian 4 generative densities, and conditionally independent latent variables z = {z(κ)}Nlatκ=1 , one has:\np(z|xµ) ∼ e −\n∑Nlat κ=1 p (κ) µ |z\n(κ)−m(κ)µ |, (3.1)\nwhere the means {m(κ)µ } are symmetry statistics, the absolute value terms are sufficient statistics and the inverse scale momenta {p(κ)µ } are Lagrange multipliers, computed so as to satisfy given expectations of the sufficient statistics. The Gibbs density class leads to:\n2. Thermodynamics and more symmetry statistics: The Gibbs class is also central in thermodynamics because it is maximum-entropy class and allows to add fluctuating attributes, other than energy. These additions are not cosmetic and fundamentally alter the dynamics of the canonical distribution, Landau & Lifshitz (1980), section 35. They can be any attributes: i) spatial attributes, as in the example below; ii) color attributes, as introduced in subsection 1.3, and others. For multiple objects, one needs specialized nets and a classifier to optimize them. This leads to:\n3. Auto-classifiers-encoder (ACE) architecture, section 4: Since classification labels are already needed above, the latent manifold is better learned: i) via supervised reconstruction, and ii) with symmetry statistics used by decoder. This leads to:\n4. Control: With symmetry statistics in the generative layer, the net can organically move or modify the respective attributes of the objects, either deterministically or randomly. The ACE architecture ensures that the modifications stay within a given class.\nExample: An important special case in visual recognition are the spatial symmetry statistics, which describe the location, size, stance etc of an object. For a simple gray two-dimensional image xµ on N pixels e.g., two of its spatial symmetry statistics are the coordinates (hµ, vµ) of its center of mass, where the ”mass” of a pixel is its intensity. Assuming independence, one can embed a translational invariance in the net, multiplying (3.1) by the spatial symmetry statistics (SSS) conditional density:\npSSS(z|xµ) ∼ e −p(h)µ |z (h)−hµ|−p(v)µ |z (v)−vµ|, (3.2)\nwhere z(h), z(v) are two new zero-mean latent random variables, responsible respectively for horizontal and vertical translation. If (h,v) are the vectors of horizontal and vertical pixel coordinates, the image is centered at the input layer via the transform (h,v)→ (h− hµ,v− vµ). This transformation is inverted, before reconstruction error is computed.\nWhen rescaled and normalized, (3.2) is the quantum mechanical probability density of a free particle, in imaginary space/time and Planck constant } = 1. Furthermore, for every observation xµ, there could be multiple or infinitely many latents {z(κ)µ }Lκ=1, L ≤ ∞, and xµ is merely a draw from a probability density prec(xµ|z). In a quantum statistics interpretation, latents are microscopic quantum variables, while observables like pixels, are macroscopic aggregates. Observations represent partial equilibria of independent small parts of the expanded (by a factor of L) data set."

      "heading" : "4 ACE WITH SYMMETRY STATISTICS.",
      "text" : "The ACE architecture with symmetry statistics is on Figure 5. As in the basic ACE, training is supervised i.e. labels are used in the auto-encoder and every class has a dedicated decoder, with unimodal sampling in the generative layer of each class. The sampling during testing is instead from a mixture of densities, with mixture weights {ωµ,c}NCc=1 for the µ-th observation, for class c, produced by the classifier. The posterior densitiy from section 2 becomes5:\np(z|xµ) = NC∑ c=1 ωµ,cp(z|xµ, c). (4.1)\n4 The Laplacian density is not in the exponential class, but is a sum of two exponential densities which are in the exponential class in their respective domains.\n5Using a similar mixture of posterior densities, but different architecturally conditional VAEs, were proposed in the context of semi-supervised learning in Kingma et al. (2014).\nAfter interim symmetry statistics are computed in box 0.3 on Figure 5, they are used to transform the input (box 0.4), before it is sent for reconstruction and classification. The inverse transformation is applied right before the calculation of reconstruction error.\nPlugging the symmetry statistics in the latent layers allows to deterministically control the reconstructed observations. Alternatively, sampling randomly from the symmetry statistics, organically “augments” the training set. External augmentation is known to improve significantly a net’s classification performance Ciresan et al. (2012), Krizhevsky et al. (2012). This in turn improves the quality of the symmetry statistics and creates a virtuous feedback cycle."

In order to zoom-in on an object, some spatial, color and other attributes are learned by classifiers in specialized attention nets. In fieldtheoretical terms, these learned symmetry statistics form the gauge group of the data set. Plugging them in the generative layers of auto-classifiers-encoders (ACE) appears to be the most direct way to simultaneously: i) generate new observations with arbitrary attributes, from a given class; ii) describe the low-dimensional manifold encoding the “essence” of the data, after superfluous attributes are factored out; and iii) organically control, i.e., move or modify objects within given observations. We demonstrate the sharp improvement of the generative qualities of shallow ACE, with added spatial and color symmetry statistics, on the distorted MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.",
