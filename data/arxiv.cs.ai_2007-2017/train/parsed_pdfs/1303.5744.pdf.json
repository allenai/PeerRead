Hobbs et a!. [Hobbs 90] have, for example, re cently proposed measures of cost to assess t.hc quality of interpretations of linguistic utterances. Tire work of Russell and Wefald [Russell 89] also exemplifies re cent interest on the applicability of dccision-tlreorctic principles to the control of reasoning processes. �lca sures of preference have a.lso been used in int.(:lligcnt decision planners to control the relaxation of \"ei<Jstic\"' constraints [Fox 90].\nThe appeal that utilitarian notions and structures have as an important element of the problem-solving pro cess lies on their ability to add to the classical logicist concept of rationality--the sound derivation of conclu sions fron1 preinises-- pragrnatic princi pies or rat.ion;d behavior that aid in the ev<Jiuation of t Ire desirability and utility of botlr assnmpt.ions an d ccJIIclrrsions. ol\" ten assisting to detel'lnine the rdatin: it nportancc or various constraints.

Our approaclr is ill fluenced by the \"logics of prcf(,rcncc\" proposed hy Rescher [Reschcr 67] where tlw truth-value (usually rnea.sureJ in a.

Our measures quantify prcfer <'ncc between alternatives (e.g., being on this or the other side of the street) from the limited perspective of a single constraint (e.g., we want to hire a taxi). Tilis formulation represents a substantial departure from Rescher's formalism where utilities are simply f11nct.ions of propositions that measure their \"global\" relative desirability, regardless of context. This global n1casure, in Rescher's approach, is given by an a.vera.ge or cont.ext-specific JesirabiJit.y values: <l l ClSSUI11ption t IJ<t!. ]e;HI:-:: to t.lw 11arrow collclu;-;ioll t.l1at. such nleasures ttllts l !tCrYe the properties of\" probability distributions.\nSecond, hy introduct,ion of lltodalities, we enh;rnce t ]J(' nliue of Inult.ivalu��d-log;ic sclicJnes, genera liz in!', both our previous scm<rutic models of fuzzy logic [Ruspiui \\II] and providing a pract.ical way to rep resent ignor;mce about the potential utility of certain cl1oices.\nl:inally, we provide bas<>s for the rational combination of\" 11ntlt.iplr, goal-specific, tllcasurcs of utility into a glol><rl prefcre11cc rd;ttion tl�<rt rcpn'.'<onts their relative illJ{lOJ't.(IJJCe.\nHey(JJJd otJr ohjecti\\'(_' of' cxp;u1ding; and exploring the not.icms propos('cl hy Ht-�schcr, \\\\\"(·' S<'Ck to establish Cllld study formal bases for utilit.y-ori�:ntecl approaches to prohknr-solviug that depart from classical \"optimiza tion\"' methods that maximize a prespecifteclllleasure of p<·rformance subject to \"hard'' constraints.

Constraints that require attainment of some goal (e.g., \"buy nice presents for Jim and Joe\") and constraints that limit resource expenditure (e.g., \"do not spend too much\") are both sources of the same type of nwa sures, which evaluate the desirability of different state of affairs (i.e., \"buying presents\" is a somcc of prefer ence rneasures, and ':not speiJding too n1uchn is an other such source). Furthermore, e1·ery constraint, including those describing system behavior (e.g . . the laws of physics): is the so1Jrce of nt.ilit.y measJJrP� (<'.g., as functions of the costs associatt-�cl wit.l1 �irnplifying as sumptions that are usually not II Jet b,y any real .syst.eJJl. such as '\"the container is filled with a perfect gas\").\nOur ideas also owe much to previons research, which established the close relationships between generalized rankings, operations research, and fuzzy logic [13ellman 80] and similarity-based semantics for that approximate logic [Rus pin i U 1]. In add iLion, we have been particularly moti vatcd by the need to pro vide practical bases for the generatio11 of sintiLrrity measures- the conceptual found0tions of a llalog ical reasoning tnethocls-- 011 the basis of the pra�ntat.ic ra tiotnle for the differentiation between alter11ati1·\" so lutions, i.e., two scenarios resemble each other if they are equally prcfcrrablc in every relcvcutt rcgilrd .\nIn closing this introduction, it is very importa11 1 to re mark that our synthesis of utilitarian and logic;tl con cepts is not the result of I:1 trivial confusion or whal is true and what is convenient. \\Ve are simply stating that the truth value, measured in a multi,·aillcd sc;de, of propositions of the form:\n\"The possible worlds is <Ill acccptl1hl\" sol11tion,'·\nn1ay· he int.erprcted {1:'-; Llw r<'lat.ivt_' dcgrc<' of pr('r<'JTtlcc given to s frotJl a specific vi('wpoil!t.\n2 Possible Worlds and Desirabilities\nOur formalism is based on the notion of JWSsi/,fc II\"Ur/d, whiclt will only be given a brief, infortrlld, cltaracter ization in this paper. Basically, a possible world, is any conceivable scenario: situation, or hciJa\\'ior that may be used to describe the state ol· a re;d-world .sys tem. Each such situation is n1odclcd by a f\"1111cl.ion, called a \\-'<tluation, that assiglls a con\\.('Jd.ioHal t.rllth valuc (i.e., either true or ralst>) to ('\\\"('f)' dcscripti\\\"(' statement, or proposition, about the syskllt. \\\\'!tile we will require that such t.nJt.lJ-assigtltJteut. ftiJlct.ic)][� be consistent with the rules of logic, II\"!' 11·ill not place at this time any other restrictions 011 the natttr<' of such assignnw11ts. Thus, possible worlds 1nay corrc-\n318 Ruspini\nspond to impossible physical situations, such as the state of idealized systems (e.g., \"perfect gases\").\nThe irnportance of the concept of of possible world, from a reasoning viewpoint, lies on its usefulness to model solutions of reasoning problems as subsets of possible worlds that satisfy certain constraints (i.e., observations, behavioral knowledge) that are usually called \"evidence.\" From such a purely logical view point, a reasoning problem consists of the determina tion of the set of possible worlds that comply with pre scribed constraints. In a classical reasoning problem, the properties of interest are related to the relations of inclusion that hold bctiYcen the set of possible worlds t.lrat ;;atisfy the evidence and sets of possible worlds wltcre some proposition of interest, or h.l'pothcsis is tn1c . lu <-l uun1bcr of' illlport.ant c�1se:-: where �uch de t.erJJlitJa.t.ion is iillpos�iiJ l c, or riJ>f>FCJSiinnt.e rca:·;(>rJiup,· probl<onts, applicable appro<.lclws. described as approx irna.tc: reasoning Inethods, seck to det.enni11c ccrt.aiti properties of tile set of possiiJlc worlds tit at are consis tent witlt the evidence [l'luspini l!O]. llegardless of the nature of our problem , however, we lllil}\" describe the object of reasoning as being that of assessing if a possible world is worthy of being called \" solution. The usc of t.he qualifier \"worthy\" in the ahove seute11cc is not accidental.

In general, however, we niaJ' regard any problen1-solving proc<'ss as the identification of models (i.e ., sets of pos sil>lc 11·orlds) that. tncd statd constraints- including t.!Jose imposr�d by IIIC(-ISUI't�tnc>Jlt.s .:uJd observ<ttioll::-; -\"to sOJIH' acccpt.ablc degree .\nl11 Sllllllllary, we 111ay S<IY t.lJc-d. \\\\\"(' :-J(_'('k sol t 1tions witl1 <l J!ltJniH'l' of' properties, eorresp<)l]ding; t.o coJnpliaJ\\C(' \\rit.]J con�t.raint.s, and t.!Jat. we an' \\rilling to pay t.o dif fere nt extents to see tliilt tltose properties come about. At tltis point, however, it is important t.o m ake a fe1r points that ar(� essential to equa te tneasures of desir ability with meas ures of truth.\nFirst, we may note that, in a conventional Boolean context, every proposition pis cquiv.::-dent to a rnea.sure of tlte solution quality. a.s tneasurcd solely from such (l ,·iewpoint (i.e., '·ot . !Jcr things hcing equal). ln our f'ornJa]islll, we ruay sa,y that\\\\\"<' have a f\"ullct.ioll D1,, called a clcsiral>ility II IC'<:lSU rc . that. assigns a value of' 1 to Clc·ry possihlc \\\\·oriel w l wn- I' is true (dcnot<:d 1c f-- p) and a value ofO to every possible world where it is false.\nIn this case, this charactenstic Junction, in categorical fashion , what is acceptable and what is not. It. is often the case, however, that the desirability of a solution is a ntattcr of degree. Iu such cases, a. Jnosl natural generalization of the notion of characteristic function will be of value to model such graded prcf\"crences: the concept of funy set [Zadeh G5]. Second, we must recognize that it will not be difficult to find problems where situation-dependent wishes and desires may not be easily expressed as a single num ber that quantifies preference. Furthermore, if we aim to associate the truth of any proposition p, not nec essarily specified as a problem constraint, with some utilitarian counterpart, we n1ust haw? son1c rnechanisn1 to indicate that compliance with such proposition is ir relevant to the solution of the probkn1. Tlte simplest nwchanisrn to reprcs('nL such irrelcnulC<: is to idcnt.if'J: a fami ly of possi/,Jc desirability mcnsur<'S to be <tsso ciated with]!. which is easily done by idcntific;li.ioll ol\" upper and lower bounds [\"or D1,, thus g<' ll <' r<t liz i ug the notions of possibility and necessity of mocl<tl logic.\nFinally, we must remark that our functions, which arc constraint-dependent, represent. relative adequacy of alternative solutions with respect. to a set of ide;d so lutions that attain or exceed some associated \"t<trget. value.\" Such ideal sol ut ions arc given a rel ative Jnca sure of adequacy that is equ al to I.\nIt should be clear. however. that t.hc \"absolute\" use fulness associated with the .'mtisf\"<Jct.iott or a p<irlicular goal should be given by some \"utility\" fuuct.ion (de fined along some suitahlc scale of ntcnsurc,ll<'llt. ) tlt<tl. loosely speak ing, rcprcs\"ltts the over<dl util ity n\"'oci atecl with its achievement. (e.g. if utility is lllc<Jsurcd in a monetary scale, we may say that the utility of p coming about is 8100). To limit. the scope of this p<� per, however, we shall confine ourselves to the discus sion of issues gern1cU1C to desirability nwa.snres, (1\\\"oid ing questions related to the absolute ut ilit.y ;Jssoci<Jt<'d with their achievenwnt.\n3 Desirability and P1·eference\nAs informally introdun�d aiJovc, dcsirahility nwasl l rcs quantify the relative val11c of diff\"crcnt. solut.io11s f\"ront the viewpoint of a single constraint. or go<� I. 1\\ltiJouglt that discussion was confined t.o \"lloJwlnst.ic\" goals, cor responding to subsets of possible worlds, t.IIC lllost. itt teresting applications of util itarian COIICcpt' im·oh · <' n1easures ranging over a rontinuous scale.\n3.1 Desirability Measures\nThe siuiplcst. way to f\"ol'lllillizc tlw ttut.io11 uf adcqtti\\ry of a solution is that. of' a lllCi:lSlll'C t.ilat as::-;igJt:-; a \\\"i.dllC of relative desirability to any COJlcCi\\·<-lhlc soltJ1.ion, a:-; de termined solely from tl1e 1·icwpoint of a sit1glc, specific\ngo<d.

(expressed by a desirability D) are given by expressions of the form � D, where � is a strong negation function.\nIt can also be seen that desirability measures !hat rank possible worlds by the extent by which they satisfy a conditional constraint of the forrn p�q, are reb ted to the clesirabilities D of }J and D' of 'I by the relation : (D�D')(w) = D'(w) , ..

Tlre ability to define such com parative functions oftcu simplifies tire evaluation of the effect of contextual considerations (e.g., tire desirabil ity of beiug iu auotlrcr pi<lce, if we are thirsty, depends ou how lll\\Jc!t \\\\'a.t.er \\\\'t-: IJ;'I.v<-' ;-\\ .Jld how ll lllch \\\\'at.er i'\"' in tire other locat iou) .\nWe will forrnalize t.his notion by considering functions of the form p(wlw') that map pairs of possil)le worlds t.o numbers between 0 and 1 so as to quantify the ex tent t.o which a possible world w is preferred to another w', from tire viewpoint of a particular constraint. \\ Ve may think of p( w l w' ) as a measure of the amount of resources that we would be willing t.o spend t.o be in w rather than in w'. It is easy to see that any defi nition for p must comply with the following rational principles:\n1. No resources should be spent to be in w if we are\n320 Ruspini\n<llreacly in w. :!. If we arc williug to spenJ resources to be in w\nwheu we are in w', theu we should not spend any resources to be in -w' if we were in w\n:.l. The amount that we wouiJ be willing to pay to be iu w when we are in w\" should be bound by above by a function of the amount that we would be willing to spend to be in w if we were in w' and of the amount that we would be willing to pay to be in w' if we \\Vere in tun.\nThese principles are captured by the following\nDefiuitiou: A function p mapping pairs of possible worlds into numbers bclwecn 0 aud 1 is called a fi l\"'i-fneuce relation if aud only if\nI. p( wlw) = 0 for all ,,. in U. :!.

[n order to develop au aggregation methodology, it is necessary first to study the relations that. exist between both types of utilitarian measures.\nTile derivation of a f.f;-prefcrence relation PD from a desirabilit.J' 1ncasure D is l'<-tsily achieved by Inectns of tlw psC'udoiuversc · �. of+:\n(!u ( wlw') = D( w) •:C• D(w') . The inverse process of derivation of a uuique dc,;irabil ity 1neasure fro1n a preference relation is, in ge!leral, not possible. One of several representation theorems of Valverde [Valverde 85], exploiting in this case the identity\np(wlw') = sup {p(wlw\"J e p(w'lw\")}' w\" in ll\nassures, however, that there is always a family {Do} of desirability measures such that\np(wlw') =sup {Do (w) 8 Do(w'J } . 0\nThe above representation has a rnost natural iuterpre t.ation as the set of constraints (i.e.1 desirability I11ca surcs) that are iuvolved in the generalized order de fined by a preference rdat.ion, i.e., the criteria that\nmake a solution better thau another. As it is of ten the case with conventional constraints, some of these generalized constraints 1nay never be �>active,\" being, in effect, superseded by more specific restric tions. For this reason, tltc above deco1nposition is never unique [Jacas 87]. \\Ve n1ay, however, always de fine a unique \"canonica.l dccornposition,\" which is sug gested by the proofs of Valverde's theorems.

Furthermore. let { Dw } and { n;, } be the Valverde rcprescnt.at.ions of p and p1, respectively. rhcn the conjunction and disjunction of p and p' are the prel'crcnce fuucl.ious. denoted p \\¥! p' and f' �' p', associated with the gen erating fcunilics { Dw ·!_, n:, .. } . a11d { Dw �11 n:u } , respectively. Furthermore, the complclneut of pis the preference relation,...,_, p associated with t.h(� generating family { � Dw }. Ji'iually, the implication preference p---+p1 is the preference rei at ion generated by the fnmily { Dtv-D� } of desirability 1neasures.\n5 Possibility and Necessity\nIt is often difficult to assess the adequacy of cer tain solutions (or particular aspects of such solutions), even from the limited perspective provided by specific problem-solving goals. While steering a mobile robot around an obstacle, for example, it. is hard to deter mine if a particular move is preferrable to another from the viewpoint. of a maneuver to be performed much later at a. ren1ote location.\n�lod;d logics [II nghes GS], by introduction of notions of po\"ible and necessary truth, permit to represent states of ignorance about the potential truth of the difl'crent statements that are being reasoned about. In the formalism presented in this paper, where re st ric live propositions have been generalized as relative ttwasures of solution adequacy, the role of the necessity and possibility operators of modal logic is replaced by lower and upper bounds for measures of desirability and preference so as to generalize the modal implica tions Np�p�Ilp. for example, if we are fully igno ra tlt . nhout the adequacy of w as a. solution n1eeting a cons t raint represented by the desirability measure\nD, tlt<•n we may represent that fact by the bounds 0 <:: D ( II' ) <:: I. We w ill say, tlterd'orc, t.h;d. a ft 1 1 tctio 11 Nu 1tt<tppi11g possihlc worlds u· into values between 0 and I is a ncc csso!'y desinibi!ity disll'ibutiun for a desirability l!lea snre D if Nu(w) <:: D(w) for all w in U. Similarly, we will say that Ilv is a Jwssible dcsimbility dist,.ibution forD if D(w) <:: Ilu(w) for all win U. The l'ollowing results permit to manipulate necessary ami possible dcsirabilities along lines that generalize si 111 i I ar derivation procedures for conventional modal logic:\n(a) If N_D is a necessary desirability for the com plcntcnt � D of D, then � N-u is a possible desirability for D. Similarly . if rr_D is a possible desirability for the complement � D of D, then � II-v is a necessary desirability for D. These rcl<tt ions arc the generalization of the well-known duality relations •N•Ji =: Ilp and •Il•p =: Np.\n(b) If N /J and Nv' are necessary desirability for D and D', respectively, then Nv @lND' and Nv !:17 N IJ' are necessary desirabilities for D ® D' and\nD r:J D', respectively. A similar statement holds for possib le desirabilities.\n(c) If N D is a necc:ss<Jry desirability forD ami if Ilry is a possi ble clesir<thility forD'. tlwu Nu·c,rr/J' is a uccessary desirability for D' �D. A dual state \"\"'\"t also holds for possible dcsirabilities.\nBou 11ds, c<tllednecessary an d JiOSsihlc preference ftrnc t.ions, ntay also be introduced to represent ignorance about relative preference between solutions. Rules for tlteir IIWnipulation, however, are considerabl y more cor11plcx than those for their desirability counterparts. A rat Iter straightforward consequence, nonetheless, of tltc definition of preference functions is that if if Nu and Ilv are necessary and possibility desirability dis tributions for a desirability measure D. then the func tions defined by the ex p ressions\nNp(wlw') = ND(w) 0 Ilv(w'),\n(:llld\nIIp(wlw') = Ill!(w) b Nu(w') ,\nTruth as Utility: A Conceptual Synthesis 321\nare necessary and possible preferences for (JD(wlw') = D(w) 8 D(w'). It should be also clear that �tcccssary and possible preference functions can always be chosen to satisfy the first two properties (generalized non reflexivity ;mel antisymmetry) of the ddinition of prefcreuce function. Less obvious is the fact tit at a possible preference func tion may always be selected to satisfy the third (or transitive) property. Since then such possible prefer ence relation will be itself a preference relation, it may be representee! by a family Dw of desirability measures that is related to tlw Valverde represent.at .ion Dw of p by the inequality D\" S D,.,.\nIn closing this section, \\\\'C tn:ly note that, in gencrnl, it is more likely that a p ml>kll t-soher will I\"· illt.cr<'stcd in issues of desirabili ty of a class of solutions or pref erence between classes of solutions rather tlt<1n the the corresponding questious for possible worlds. U nfort.u uately, it is not pos:::;ible to cha..ra.ctcrizc such general utilitarian concepts using lHitneric-valued fu11cLions as asessments of the utility of a proposition pas a solution clepencl on the particular world w f- 1' under consider ation. It is possible, hmrever, to define bounds\nNv(P) = inf D(w) , and IID(JI) = iuf D(w) , wf-p\nwhich bound tl1e adequac y of any p-world.\nNote also that such ho 1 111ds may be gcncrcttcd front those of possible and necessary desirabili ty distribu tions for specific sol 11t.ions .

Si1 1 1ilarity relations S assign a value S(w, w') between 0 aml 1 to every pair of possi ble worlds w and w' in such a way that\n322 Ruspini\n1. S(w, w) = 1 for all possible worlds w, \"2.

This statement, reflected by the well known relation\nS(w, w') =min ( � p(w[w'), � p(w'[w) ) ,\npcrlllits derivation of a similarity relation from a pref erellce relatio11.\nl·:xt.c•nsions of the notion of similari t.y to allow defini ticm of bounds for the resemblance between p-worlcb ami q-n'orlds, called degre<C o[ illlplication and degree of corJ.sistence, which are abo the result, of applying a silllilar operation to the corresponding preference bounds N,(pfq) and II,(pfq), play an essential role in the interpretation of the possibility distributions of fuzzy logic.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part. by the United States Army Research Office under Contract No. DAAL038(1-E-0 156 and in part by a contract with the Labo ratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research.
