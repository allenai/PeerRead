      "text" : "Teaching computers to answer complex questions expressed in natural language is an old longing of artificial intelligence that requires sophisticated reasoning and human language understanding. In this work, we investigate generic natural language interfaces for semistructured databases. Typical questions for this task are topic independent and require multi-step reasoning involving discrete operations such as aggregation, comparison, superlatives or arithmetic. One example is the question What was the difference in average attendance between 2010 and 2001? which has to be answered based on a table containing information from\nsoccer games1. This line of research is practically relevant for automated systems that support interactions between nonexpert users and databases without requiring specific programming knowledge.\nQuestion-Answering (QA) systems are often faced with a trade-off between the openness of the domain and the depth of logical compositionality hidden in questions. One example are systems able to answer complex questions about a specific topic (e.g. [Wang et al., 2015]). Unsurprisingly, these systems often struggle to generalize to other, more open domains. On the other side, topic-independent QA systems that can potentially interrogate large databases are usually limited to simple look-up operations (e.g. [Bordes et al., 2014a]).\nHere, we propose a novel weakly supervised model for natural language interfaces operating on semi-structured tables. Our deep learning approach eliminates the need for expensive feature engineering in the candidate scoring phase, while being able to generalize well to never-seen before data. Each natural language question is translated into a set of computer understandable candidate representations, called logical forms, based on the work of [Pasupat and Liang, 2015]. Further, the most likely such program is selected in two steps: i) using a simple algorithm, logical forms are transformed back into paraphrases (textual representations) understandable by non-expert users, ii) next, these raw strings are further embedded together with the respective questions in a jointly learned vector space using convolutional neural networks over character and word embeddings. Multi-layer neural networks and bilinear mappings are employed as effective similarity measures and combined to score the candidate interpretations. Finally, the highest ranked logical form is executed against the input data to retrieve the answer that will be shown to the user. Our method uses only weak-supervision from questionanswer-table input triples, without requiring expensive annotations of logical forms or latent operation sequences.\nWe empirically confirm our approach on a series of experiments on WikiTableQuestions [Pasupat and Liang, 2015], a real-world dataset containing 22,033 pairs of questions and their corresponding manually retrieved answers with about 2,108 randomly selected Wikipedia tables. The inherent chal-\n1Taken from the WikiTableQuestions dataset: http: //nlp.stanford.edu/software/sempre/wikitable/ viewer/#204-590\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 58\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Fe\nb 20\n17\nlenges of this dataset include i) the small number of training examples, ii) the complexity of questions that generally require compositionality over multiple simpler operations, iii) generalization to completely unseen tables and domains at test time, and iv) lack of strong supervision. An ensemble of our best models is able to reach state-of-the-art accuracy of 38.7% on this task, showing that neural networks are promising at outperforming engineered systems when dealing with complex questions. We provide further insight into our method by comparing against a set of baselines (including engineered feature systems) and model variations, as well as showing ablation and error analysis studies."

      "heading" : "2 Related Work",
      "text" : "We now briefly highlight prior research relevant to our work. There are two main types of QA systems: semantic parsing-based and embedding-based.\nSemantic parsing-based methods perform a functional parse of the question that is further converted to a machine understandable program and executed on a knowledgebase or database. A big obstacle for semantic parsers is the need for annotated logical forms when dealing with new domains. To tackle this problem, our method follows recent work of [Reddy et al., 2014; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013] that relies solely on weak-supervision through question-answertable triples. In the context of QA for semi-structured tables and dealing with multi-compositional queries, [Pasupat and Liang, 2015] generate and rank candidate logical forms with a log-linear model trained on question-answer pairs. The logical form with the highest model probability is then considered as the correct interpretation and is executed. In this work, we generate logical form candidates in the same way as [Pasupat and Liang, 2015]. While they resort to hand-crafted features to determine the relevance of the candidates for a question, we use automatic learning of representations, thus benefiting from generalization and flexibility. To do so, we embed each question and the paraphrases of the respective candidate logical forms into the same vector space, making use of similarity metrics for scoring. Paraphrases have been successfully used to facilitate semantic parsers [Wang et al., 2015; Berant and Liang, 2014]. While [Berant and Liang, 2014] is suited for factoid questions with a modest amount of compositionality, [Wang et al., 2015] targets more complicated questions. Both of these paraphrase-driven QA systems differ from our work as their scoring relies on hand-crafted features.\n[Neelakantan et al., 2016] also focus on compositional questions, but instead of generating and ranking multiple logical forms, they propose a model that directly constructs a logical form from an embedding of the question. A list of discrete operations are manually defined and each operation is parametrized by a real-valued vector that is learned during training. A separate recurrent neural network (RNN) is used for modeling the history of selected operations and the question representation. The probability distributions over operations and columns are induced using the question embedding, the history and an attention vector. While their model performs well on semi-structured tables, understanding how it generated the logical form is not trivial. Recently, [Yin et al.,\n2015] propose Neural Enquirer, a fully neural, end-to-end differentiable network that executes queries across multiple tables. They use a synthetic dataset to demonstrate the abilities of the model to deal with compositionality in the questions.\nEmbedding-based methods represent the question and the answer as semantic vectors. Compatibility between a question-answer pair is then determined by their similarity in the shared vector space. Existing approaches often represent questions and knowledgebase constitutes in a single vector using simple bag-of-words (BOW) models [Bordes et al., 2014a; Bordes et al., 2014b] under the framework of memory networks. [Dong et al., 2015] propose a multi-column convolutional neural network to account for the word order and higher order n-grams. Even though we embed questions along paraphrases instead of answers, our method relates to embedding-based models since the key challenge is learning representations. However, whereas these models are applied on datasets that require little compositional reasoning, our work targets questions whose answers ask for multi-step complex deductions and operate on semi-structured tables instead of structured knowledgebases. Representation learning using deep learning architectures has been widely explored in other domains, e.g. in the context of sentiment classification, [Kim, 2014; Socher et al., 2013], or for image-hashtag prediction [Denton et al., 2015].\nQA systems also differ in the knowledge structure they reason on, which can impose additional challenges. Systems vary from operating on structured knowledge bases [Bordes et al., 2014b]; [Bordes et al., 2014a] to semi-structured tables [Pasupat and Liang, 2015], [Neelakantan et al., 2016], [Jauhar et al., 2016] and completely unstructured text, which is related to information extraction [Clark et al., 2016]. We focus on semi-structured tables that face the trade-off between degree of structure and ubiquity."

Specifically, given a pair of input table and question to be answered, the table is first transformed into a knowledge graph (KG). Next,\nAlgorithm 1 Recursive paraphrasing of a Lambda DCS logical form. The + operation is defined as string concatenation with spaces.

This is done using a semantic parser that recursively builds up logical forms by repeatedly applying deduction rules. Each candidate logical form is represented in Lambda DCS form [Liang, 2013] and can be transformed into a SPARQL query, whose execution against the KG yields an answer.\nFor instance, the question How many people attended the last Rolling Stones concert? will be translated into a set of candidate logical forms, among which the correct one is: R[λx[Attendance.Number.x]] .argmax(Act.RollingStones,Index)."

      "text" : "We describe our proposed paraphrasing algorithm to transform logical forms into textual representations. These, and not the original logical forms, are further scored against the input question. Besides the advantages of interpretability and comprehensibility, we also observe a quality gain when using paraphrases in comparison with ranking directly based on the string representations of the original Lambda DCS expressions (details in section 4.4).\nUsability and extensibility of QA systems may benefit from revealing the translation of the human-language question in machine-language (e.g. Lambda DCS in our case). This is called transparency, i.e. the property of revealing the generated program from an input question in its raw format. However, this might not achieve comprehensibility, the characteristic of a system to be understandable by non-technical users. Paraphrasing the logical form z into a textual representation t satisfies both of these properties as it yields a nonexpert understandable description of the executed program based on an input question.\nGiven a logical form z in Lambda DCS, we paraphrase it\nusing a simple algorithm that recursively traverses the tree representation of z starting at the root. The translation operations associated with each node type can be seen in Algorithm 1. As an example of how this algorithm works, the correct candidate logical form for the question mentioned in section 3.1, namely How many people attended the last Rolling Stones concert? will be mapped to the paraphrase Attendance as number of last row where act is Rolling Stones."

Features used by our scoring system are learned automatically without the need for hand-engineering. We use two separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for question and paraphrase embeddings, on top of which a max-pooling operation is applied. The CNNs receive as input token embeddings consisting of concatenation of word and character vectors. The details of our model are outlined in the following sections. For readability, some hyper-parameter values are shown in section 4.2."

      "text" : "We now detail the neural architecture used to embed tokens of an input piece of text (e.g. question, paraphrase). This model is depicted in Figure 1. Every token in our vocabulary is parametrized by a word and a character embedding, both learned during training.\nWe find that word vector initialization affects both the convergence speed and quality of our method. A typical choice for this initialization is to use pre-trained vectors learned from\nunsupervised textual data. These models are known to encode both syntactic and semantic information, e.g. similar or related words like synonyms are mapped to close points in the vector space. We experiment with two different popular methods, namely GloVe [Pennington et al., 2014] and Word2vec [Mikolov et al., 2013], comparing them also with random initializations. Embeddings for tokens not in the vocabulary are randomly initialized by sampling each component from a uniform distribution U [−0.25, 0.25].\nWhen comparing the textual representations of the logical forms to the input question, we notice that in many cases similar numbers or dates are written in different ways, e.g. 1,000,000 vs 1000000. Other common sources of noise are rare words and word misspellings. These are different or unknown tokens in the vocabulary for which word embeddings alone would perform poorly. One technique to mitigate these issues inspired from [Kim et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015] is to use character embeddings in addition to word vectors. Token vectors are then obtained using a CNN over the constituent characters. Our CNN model uses multiple filter widths, followed by a max-over-time pooling layer and concatenation with the respective word vector."

We use filters spanning a varying amount of tokens with the widths from a set L. For each filter width l ∈ L, we learn n different filters, each of dimension Rl×d. After the convolution layer, we apply a max-over-time pooling on the resulting feature matrices which yields, per filter-width, a vector of dimension n. Next, we concatenate the resulting max-over-time pooling vectors of the different filter-widths in L to form our sentence embedding. The final\nembedding size produced by this architecture is thus n|L|. As non-linearity we use Exponential Linear Units (ELUs) [Clevert et al., 2015]."

In this paper, we explore deep learning techniques for answering multi-step reasoning questions that operate on semi-structured tables. Challenges here arise from the level of logical compositionality expressed by questions, as well as the domain openness. Our approach is weakly supervised, trained on question-answer-table triples without requiring intermediate strong supervision. It performs two phases: first, machine understandable logical forms (programs) are generated from natural language questions following the work of [Pasupat and Liang, 2015]. Second, paraphrases of logical forms and questions are embedded in a jointly learned vector space using word and character convolutional neural networks. A neural scoring function is further used to rank and retrieve the most probable logical form (interpretation) of a question. Our best single model achieves 34.8% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, while the best ensemble of our models pushes the state-of-the-art score on this task to 38.7%, thus slightly surpassing both the engineered feature scoring baseline, as well as the Neural Programmer model of [Neelakantan et al., 2016].",
