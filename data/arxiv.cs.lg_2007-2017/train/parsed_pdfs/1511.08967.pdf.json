      "text" : "In the robotic search & rescue problem (S&R), we have a robot whose task is to search and rescue hidden target objects in the environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one method the robot can utilize to learn an optimal action selection rule, referred to as an optimal policy. Unfortunately, due to large state spaces that are common in robotics, the learning time and memory requirements can quickly become prohibitively expensive as the robot’s task becomes more complex. The robot may run out of time or experience mechanical failure before learning is complete, thereby making RL often impractical. Moreover, when the agent is given a new task in a different environment, it must\nre-learn a new policy from scratch as it loses the knowledge it gained from previous experiences.\nMulti-task learning (MTL) helps to ameliorate this problem by enabling the agent to use its experience from previously learned tasks to improve learning performance in a related but different task (Caruana, 1997). In batch MTL, multiple tasks are learned simultaneously, while in online MTL, the tasks are learned consecutively. The latter method is of more interest for S&R applications, as it allows the agent to continually build on its knowledge over a sequence of tasks, thereby lessening the learning cost for every new task. Using MTL, we can train the robot in simulation ahead of time over a series of tasks, then transfer the learned knowledge to the real robot. The end result is an intelligent, flexible machine which can quickly adapt to new scenarios using learned knowledge, and which can learn new tasks more efficiently (Thrun, 1996).\nA robot capable of learning new tasks quickly by building upon previously learned knowledge would be vastly useful in applications such as S&R, where time constraints are an issue and where the robot is often presented with similar tasks in various scenarios with different environment dynamics.\nIn this project, we framed the problem as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, where the agent’s task is to find the target object in an environment. To allow variations in the tasks, we changed the coefficient µt of ground friction for each task t. This is a simplified version of the S&R problem, focusing on having the robot learn across different scenarios (in this case, ground friction). This setup is applicable in situations where the robot has to drive over various types of grounds, such as rough carpet or sand.\nUsing ROS and MATLAB, we began by implementing two single-task RL methods on a Turtlebot 2: Q-learning and policy gradient RL (PG). Then we implemented the Policy Gradient Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm (PGELLA), an online MTL algorithm using PG that allows ef-\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n08 96\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 9\nN ov\n2 01\nficient sharing of knowledge between consecutive tasks to accelerate learning (Bou Ammar et al., 2014).\nResults and analysis of these implementations can be found in Section 5. In particular, we discuss experimental results of using a user policy to improve the learning performance of Q-learning, and demonstrate how increasing the size of the state space can exacerbate the learning cost for Q-learning. We also compare the learning speed of PG and Q-learning, and show that the robot learns noticeably faster using PG.\nThis project marks the first time that the Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm (ELLA) (Ruvolo & Eaton, 2013) was implemented on a real robot. PG-ELLA has been proven to be effective for simple dynamical systems (Bou Ammar et al., 2014), and we created several demonstration videos showing its effectiveness. However due to time constraints, we have not done complete empirical analysis of our PGELLA implementation, instead leaving this to future work."

      "text" : "The reinforcement learning problem can be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), where the problem model 〈S,A, P,R, , γ〉 consists of a state space S, a set of actions A, a state transition probability function P : S × A × S 7→ [0, 1] describing the environment’s dynamics, a reward function r : S × A × S 7→ R, and a discount factor γ ∈ [0, 1] which trades off the importance of sooner versus later rewards. We have an agent and an environment that interact continually, the agent selecting actions and the environment responding to those actions and presenting new situations to the agent. At each time step t ∈ Z+, the agent receives the environment’s current state st ∈ S, and on that basis selects an action at ∈ A(st), where A(st) is the set of legal actions in state st. One time step later, as a consequence of the agent’s action and the current state, the environment sends a numerical reward r(st,at, st+1) ∈ R and a new state st+1 to the agent. The agent’s goal is to maximize the total expected discounted return, defined as\nRt = ∞∑ k=0 γkrt+k+1 ,\nwhere rt := r(st,at, st+1).\nAt each time step, the agent updates its policy πt : S × A 7→ [0, 1], where for each (s, a) ∈ S × A, πt(s, a) is the probability that the agent selects at = a if st = s. Reinforcement learning techniques specify how the agent implements its policy as a result of its experience. Two RL techniques that we implemented are Q-learning and policy gradient RL (PG), which we briefly desribe below."

We took the quotient [ω]/12 (which takes on values in {1, . . . , 30}) rather than [ω], in order to reduce the size of the state space.\nIt is reasonable to define our state space in this way, as there are S&R scenarios where the robot has already located the target object, and knows the GPS coordinates of itself and of the target object."

In our analysis of Q-learning’s performance in Section 5.1, we use a learning rate of α = 0.1.\nSince the action space {(v`, vω)ᵀ} for PG is 2-dimensional, the episodic REINFORCE algorithm inputs two learning rates α` and αω , one for each of v` and vω respectively. Letting U = {10−j : j ∈ {3, 4, . . . , 8}}, we chose learning rates for each task using the following method: we tested every pair (α`, αω) ∈ U × U and chose the pair that yielded the policy with the highest average cumulative reward per episode.

      "text" : "One drawback of the Q-learning algorithm is that the learning cost becomes prohibitively expensive as the state space grows large. To try to speed up the learning, we implemented a user policy πu : S × A 7→ [0, 1] that allows the robot to learn by demonstration. The idea is to use the user’s trajectories to bootstrap the Q-table for learning. The user’s trajectories are sub-optimal, so RL will refine them to create π.\nWe first manually drive the robot around using keyboard teleop, creating an arbitrary number of user trajectories Tu that eventually lead the robot to the target object. Then these user trajectories are stored and used to compute the user policy πu, where for every state-action pair (s, a), πu(s, a) is the probability that the user chooses action a in state s. When the robot follows the user policy πu in a state s, it computes the nearest state s′ ∈ Tu to s, then chooses the most probable action argmaxa πu(s ′, a).\nThe robot initially starts out with numbers p, q ∈ [0, 1], p+q ≤ 1, such that for every time step t, the robot chooses a random action with probability p, follows the user policy with probability q, and chooses the best action based on its current policy πt otherwise. Over time, as the robot’s policy πt becomes closer to optimal, p and q are slowly decreased until the robot can autonomously complete its task without the user’s help. In our experiments, we decreased p and q by 1% every 1,000 episodes.\nIn Fig. 4, we compare the results from two experiments I and II, where in I we initially set p = .2 and q = .65 (the robot having a relatively high probability of following πu), and in II we initially set p = .2 and q = 0 (no user policy). We ran both experiments for 4,000 episodes each, recording the cumulative reward and the total number of steps taken to reach the target in every episode. In both graphs the plots seem to converge after about 1,700 episodes, although the plots from experiment II have greater variance. This suggests that the learning rates for Q-learning with and without user policy are similar, although having user\npolicy may more quickly yield a more stable policy."

(See Fig. 3 for an illustration.) We note that ω = β − ζ.\nIn Fig. 5, we compare Q-learning’s performance with the 2-dimensional state representation {([d], [ω]/12)ᵀ} and with the 3-dimensional state representation {([d], [β]/12, [ζ]/12)ᵀ}. In both plots, the agent’s performance improves at a faster rate and achieves significantly better results with the smaller state space.

Then for another 400 episodes, we used π to select the robot’s actions, recording the cumulative reward and the number of steps to reach the target for every episode. Using these criteria, we\nfound that π performs at least as well, if not better, than the user policy πu (see Table 2).\nWe note that the robot learned a policy almost as good as optimal in a shorter period of time than it did using Qlearning. PG has several advantages over Q-learning for this given task, as function approximation allows PG to handle continuous actions and states and even imperfect state information."

We can add less informative features to the state vector, such as the robot’s position (xA, yA) on the map, or the robot’s perceptionbased data (e.g., is the target visible?). We can also add obstacles to the environment, essentially turning the map into a maze. Additionally, we can have variable environment dynamics: for example, instead of having a uniform ground friction coefficient, we can place patches of rough carpet or sand on the ground. Lastly, we can move PGELLA onto a robot in the real world, where imperfect and noisy sensor data are common.\nOf course, learning will quickly become more expensive, as we have demonstrated with the larger state space for Qlearning in Section 5.1.2.
