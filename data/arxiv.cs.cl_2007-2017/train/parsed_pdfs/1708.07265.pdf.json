In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution. It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the performance.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the ever increasing availability of machine readable text, the interest in automatic textual analysis tools has grown substantially given its potential for several important applications. One area of special interest is authorship attribution, which has been studied from different perspectives. In authorship attribution, we are interested in assigning an author to a given text [1, 2]. Traditional approaches use statistical analysis of lexical and syntactical features [1, 3, 4], while other methods focus on text modeling using complex networks [5–10]. The latter is capable of representing structural as well as semantic characteristics [11–14], complementing traditional methods.\nRecently, a network method for text modeling was proposed [15]. This method uses mesoscopic networks to capture the flow of narratives. In [16], this approach was used for authorship attribution. By mesoscopic it is meant that the derived networks are able to reflect text relationships at a topological scale larger than usually approached by using, for instance, word adjacency. It has been suggested that such model can provide insights about the discursive structure of texts [16], an issue which is explored further in the current work.\nThe work presented in [16] focuses on network feature extraction, while the present incorporates features from the visualizations of these networks. This has been done to explore how the visual features of the networks, which was called calligraphy in [16], can contribute to the accuracy of authorship attribution. The framework used in this work is illustrated in Figure 1. The obtained results suggest that these network visual features are as capable as topological measurements to characterize authors’ styles. Furthermore, when the visual and topological features were combined, a better result is achieved.\nThe remaining of this paper is organized as follows: Section II defines the authorship attribution problem and presents some traditional and network based approaches. The proposed pipeline, which includes the process of obtaining mesoscopic networks and the selected image and network measurements, is presented in Section III. Then, Section IV reports the obtained results using image and"

      "text" : "Given a text of unknown or disputed authorship and a set of candidate authors, the goal of an authorship attribution is to identify the correct unknown author [1]. One of the most important findings in authorship studies was reported by Mosteller and Wallace [17]. They investigated the authorship of several political documents and discovered that the frequencies of common words – such as some pronouns, prepositions, and articles – are useful to characterize the authorship of texts.\nTraditionally, works in authorship attribution use simple, yet useful features to characterize writing styles, such as statistics extracted from words and characters (e.g. frequency of the n-grams of words or characters, and the frequency of punctuation marks) [1, 3, 4]. Syntactic and semantic features can also be used for the task, such as the frequency of the constituent parts of a sentence and information about words synonyms [1]. In recent years, authorship attribution has been studied from a different perspective. Some works have taken advantage of dense and real-valued vectorial representations and deep neural networks [18–20], such as their application to train language models for each author or to learn continuous vectors for n-grams of words.\nComplex network-based approaches have also been used to assign authorship. In most of these approaches, co-occurrence networks are created from the texts [5–10]. Basically, in such approaches, co-occurrence networks are created by connecting adjacent words. Then, several topological measurements – such as the clustering coefficient, degree, frequency of motifs – are extracted and their respective values are used as features in machine learning algorithms. These previous works have shown that structure plays a prominent role in characterizing authors’ styles. Interestingly, even if only stopwords are used, the structure of the remaining structure in the networks is still essential for the accurate identification of styles [8].\nAnother possibility for text representation is to map texts as mesoscopic networks, thus providing a model for identifying the relationship between larger chunks of texts [15]. Interestingly, Marinho et al. [16] presented mesoscopic networks created from a dataset and the provided visualizations revealed characteristics of the authors, such as the preference for short stories over novels, as well as characteristics of each text, such as the similarities between the beginning and ending of a particular book. These mesoscopic networks also characterize the unfolding of the stories."

      "heading" : "III. MATERIALS AND METHODS",
      "text" : "Our authorship attribution method is based on the mesoscopic modeling approach [15]. The first step to create mesoscopic networks is the preprocessing of the text. In this study, we remove stopwords (such as arti-\ncles and prepositions), and the remaining words are lemmatized. The preprocessed text is then partitioned into a set of paragraphs T = {p1, p2 . . . , pn}, where n is the total number of paragraphs, and pi is the set of words belonging to the same paragraph (see Figure 2(a)). Taking into account the paragraphs’ order, all possible sets of ∆ consecutive paragraphs are grouped, as shown in Figure 2(b). Each set W∆i = {pi, pi+1 . . . , pi+∆−1} represents a network node. From these nodes, a weighted and undirected network is created, in which all nodes i and j are connected and the weights are computed as the cosine similarity between the vector containing the values of tf-idf statistics associated to each node [21], as illustrated in Figure 2(c). In the current study, we employed the following tf-idf mapping:\ntf-idf(w, d,D) = fw,d n × log ( |D| dw ) , (1)\nwhere fw,d is the frequency of a given word w occurring in document d comprising n words, |D| is the total number of documents and dw is the number of documents in which the word w occurs. Note that, in this approach, each set of consecutive paragraphs W , i.e. each node, is considered a document.\nIn order to obtain unweighted networks, we remove the edges with the lowest weights until a certain criteria\n3\nis met, as can be seen in Figure 2(d). In this paper, the selected criterion requires that all networks have the same network average degree 〈k〉 = 2E/N , where E is the number of edges and N is the number of nodes. The selected value for 〈k〉 was 40. Note that such an approach was previously used in [16]."

Because most of the selected measurements apply to a single node, some statistics – such as\nthe average, standard deviation, and skewness – were extracted from each distribution and used as features for the classification algorithms."

      "text" : "According to Marinho et al. [16], the visualization of mesoscopic networks can provide information about the writing style of authors. In the present study, we used image processing analysis to extract characteristics from these visualizations, which are used to characterize authors. First, the complex networks are visualized, using a force directed algorithm, which is based on attraction force between connected nodes and repulsion force between all pairs of nodes [27]. To that end, we employed the software provided by Silva et al. [28] with fixed parameters. 2D visualizations were used to remove the need to define the projection angle. Furthermore, the images were converted to monochromatic versions (called binary images). A preprocessing step was employed in which the images are dilated and eroded [29] in order to remove small holes. We considered the object size and the higher eigenvalue (λ1) of the the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [30] to find the dilation kernel as follows:\ncdim = cλ1, (2)\nwhere c is a constant, set as c = 3 · 10−4. In other words, the larger the object is, the larger the kernel size.\nThe following features were extracted from the preprocessed images:\n1. Area : The object area A is calculated as the sum of all pixels of the object in the image (see Figure 3);\n2. Perimeter : The perimeter of an object, P , is the arc length of the external border of the object. An example is shown in Figure 3;\n3. Euler number : This measurement is derived from the number of holes in the image. It is computed as:\ne = No −Nh, (3)\nwhere Nh is the number of holes in the image and No is the number of objects. An example is shown in Figure 3, where No = 1, Nh = 2 and e = −1. Note that for all images in this study, No = 1;\n4. Minimum enclosing circle : The minimum enclosing circle Mc is the smallest circle that includes all of the objects’ pixels [31]. We measured the radius and the x and y coordinates of the central point of this circle. Figure 3 illustrates these measurements;\n5. Convex hull : similar to the minimum enclosing circle, the convex hull consists of the smallest convex polygon including all the pixels from the object [32] (see Figure 3). We compute the polygons’\n4 area Ca, perimeter Cp, and residual area Cr. The latter is calculated as:\nCr = Ca −A. (4)\n6. Elongation : This measurement quantifies how stretched an object is. It is calculated as the ratio between the variances of the first (λ1) and second (λ2) axes of the PCA of the image [33].\n7. Lacunarity : This feature [34] quantifies the variation of the size of the ‘voids’ of the objects in an image, as shown in Figure 5. Note that when the holes are more uniform, the lacunarity (L) value is lower. In this study, we employed the self-referred approach to lacunarity proposed by Rodrigues et al. [35], which involves circular windows of radius r.\n8. Fourier : The Fourier transform represents the signal (image) in the frequency domain [33]. In this\nLacunarity\nL20 = 1.2\nL20 = 1.0"

      "heading" : "Image analysis",
      "text" : "So as to illustrate some of the visual specificities present in the constructed networks in this paper, we used a visualization method to generate three networks from each of four different authors. These were: Edgar Allan Poe, Saki, Mark Twain and Henry James. These networks are presented in Figure 7. In order to better visualize the narrative flow, color was added to the images. Several of the loops that appear in the images are a consequence of the network visualization. These loops could have been removed manually, but we chose not to interfere in any step of the process.\nThe obtained images suggest a kind of visual network whose edges are narrow strings while the nodes correspond to intersections appearing along these strings. Observe that the string extremities also define nodes. Pieces of the same string initiating and terminating in a node are henceforth called visual loops. Nodes with several connections are called visual hubs. Two types of these hubs can be identified in Figure 7: tight hubs, as seen in Huckleberry Finn’s network; and loose hubs, found in The Turn of the Screw.\nThe images’ most noticeable feature is clearly the absence or presence of visual nodes in the networks. Both Saki and Poe have networks without many nodes. This can easily be explained since them both favor collections of unrelated short stories. Nonetheless, there are some small differences between the aforementioned networks; Poe’s networks depict some small scale loops that are absent in Saki’s networks. We hypothesize that, although these differences are visually minor, they will have a notable effect on the respective mesoscopic network measurements.\nHenry James’ The Real Thing and Other Tales also present small scale loops, but in this case they are more pronounced. Contrariwise, in the other books from James, specially in The Turn of The Screw, the presence of longer loops is more prevalent. We attribute this effect to the book’s plot, where almost all the story consists of the narration of a single character and her interactions with only three other people inside a house, using therefore similar vocabulary throughout the book. We also suspect that by being a suspense/horror story the narrative keeps returning to the same place in order to build up suspense.\nTwain’s books also have their own peculiarities. His books’ networks are much more convoluted than the other authors’, having many more long loops. This is indicative that he had a preference for re-using specific patterns throughout his novels. These patterns could possibly be attributed to either characters’ speech patterns or situational vocabulary. The former are easily\nseen in Huckleberry Finn’s network, organized around a tight visual hub. In this novel, Twain tried to represent the phonetic differences of a slave’s speech pattern. Therefore, whenever Jim (a recently freed slave) interacts with other characters, several distinctive words are used, causing it to have a very typical tf-idf distribution, leading to the tight hub.\nIt is interesting to notice that both Huckleberry Finn and The Turn of the Screw have many long loops and also present a central hub, but there are clear differences. We suppose that these differences are due to distinct underlying reasons. In Huckleberry Finn, the long loops appear to be caused by a single character distinctive vocabulary. On the other hand, The Turn of the Screw is a book that takes place mostly in the same location, with few different characters, and therefore shares similar situations throughout the book, making these long loops more spread out."

      "text" : "In order to evaluate the capability of the proposed method to classify books according to their respective authors, we calculated all the image features, IF henceforth, described in Section III. These features were selected and ordered according to SVM’s (Support Vector Machine) attribute selection [36]. Furthermore, we used expectation maximization (EM) [37] and KMeans [38], which are unsupervised classifier algorithms. The number of classes was set to 10 in order to reflect the number of authors. In order to find the best number of features, we tested the n first features in the ranking by varying n from 1 to F , where F is the total number of features (see Table II). The best classification accuracy, 54%, was achieved using n = 14. This result supports the hypothesis that there are visual differences among the visualizations of the mesoscopic networks, which are captured by the image features.\nAn alternative method to classify these texts is to use features obtained from the complex network measurements, or network features (NF). The selected measurements were presented in Section III. We employed the same machine learning methodology that was applied to the image features and obtained an accuracy of 54% for n = 15. We also combined all features (IF + NF) and classified the texts using the same methodology. In this case, a better accuracy rate was achieved: 58%, with n = 19.\n6"

We utilize the classifiers with best accuracy from the previous sub section. We can see that, as expected, the results that consider both image and network features are better than those that consider only one type of feature.\nNote that the results reflect our analysis in subsection IV: while the result for the comparison between Poe and Saki, and James and Twain yielded an accuracy of 70%, all other results have an 100% accuracy. This is a clear indication that the features selected reflect our intuitions and that it is even possible to discriminate between similar networks, albeit improvements are desirable."

We applied PCA to the image and network features separately and achieved reasonable separation, specially with network features, as shown in Figure 9. Network and image features were combined achieving a better separation, as depicted in Figure 10. According to this figure, it is clear that our features are capable of capturing some stylistic choices of the authors. For example, Poe and Saki’s generated networks have similar structures and are fairly close to one another, but the features are distinctive enough to produce very little actual overlap. It is also interesting to note that the PCA weights in Figure 11 show that both image and network features have strong contribution to the separation.\n7 Au st en Bo w er Da rw in Di ck en s Ha rd y Ja m es M el vi lle Sa ki Po e Tw ai n Twain Poe Saki Melville James Hardy Dickens Darwin Bower Austen 0.6 1 1 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.9 1 1 0.8 0.6 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.8 0.6 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.8 0.6 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.5 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.6 0.8\n(a) IF\nAu st\nen\nBo w\ner\nDa rw\nin\nDi ck\nen s\nHa rd\ny\nJa m\nes\nM el\nvi lle Sa ki Po e\nTw ai\nn\nTwain\nPoe\nSaki\nMelville\nJames\nHardy\nDickens\nDarwin\nBower\nAusten\n0.6 0.6 0.7 0.5 0.7 0.8 1 0.8 0.9\n0.8 0.6 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.7 0.7\n1 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.9 1 0.6\n0.8 0.7 1 0.9 0.9 0.9\n0.5 0.8 0.9 0.7 0.5\n0.6 0.8 0.9 0.8\n0.7 0.8 0.9\n0.8 0.8\n0.7\n(b) NF\nAu st\nen\nBo w\ner\nDa rw\nin\nDi ck\nen s\nHa rd\ny\nJa m\nes\nM el\nvi lle Sa ki Po e\nTw ai\nn\nTwain\nPoe\nSaki\nMelville\nJames\nHardy\nDickens\nDarwin\nBower\nAusten\n0.6 0.9 1 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.9 1 1\n0.8 0.7 0.9 0.9 0.9 1 0.7 0.7\n1 0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 1 0.8\n0.8 0.8 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9\n0.5 0.8 1 0.6 0.7\n0.6 0.8 0.9 0.5\n0.6 0.9 0.9\n0.8 0.9\n0.7\n(c) IF + NF\nFIG. 8: Accuracy rates (from 0 to 1) in the pairwise classification using only image features (a) - IF, only network features (b) - NF, and the combination of the two strategies (c) - IF + NF.

In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution. It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the performance.",
