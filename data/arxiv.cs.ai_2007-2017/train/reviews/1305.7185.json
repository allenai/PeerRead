The article lists elements required to achieve this and describes the main one: a KB editing protocol that keeps the KB free of automatically/manually detected inconsistencies while not forcing them to discuss or agree on terminology and beliefs nor requiring a selection committee.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 18:06:05 GMT  (321kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7185v1", "12 pages, 2 figures, journal"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 2 figures, journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["philippe a martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7185"}
