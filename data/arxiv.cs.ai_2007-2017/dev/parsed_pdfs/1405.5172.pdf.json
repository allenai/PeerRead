EMO employs searcher agents that emulate a population of charged particles which interact to each other according to electromagnetism’s laws of attraction and repulsion. However, EMO usually requires a large number of iterations for a local search procedure; any reduction or cancelling over such number, critically perturb other issues such as convergence, exploration, population diversity and accuracy. This paper presents an enhanced EMO algorithm called OBEMO, which employs the OppositionBased Learning (OBL) approach to accelerate the global convergence speed. OBL is a machine intelligence strategy which considers the current candidate solution and its opposite value at the same time, achieving a faster exploration of the search space. The proposed OBEMO method significantly reduces the required computational effort yet avoiding any detriment to the good search capabilities of the original EMO algorithm. Experiments are conducted over a comprehensive set of benchmark functions, showing that OBEMO obtains promising performance for most of the discussed test problems."

      "text" : "Global Optimization (GO) [1,2] has issued applications for many areas of science [3], engineering [4], economics [5,6] and others whose definition requires mathematical modelling [7,8].

The difficulties associated with the use of mathematical methods over GO problems have contributed to\n1 Corresponding author, Tel +52 33 1378 5900, ext. 27714, E-mail: erik.cuevas@cucei.udg.mx\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n2\nthe development of alternative solutions. Linear programming and dynamic programming techniques, for example, often have failed in solving (or reaching local optimum at) NP-hard problems which feature a large number of variables and non-linear objective functions. In order to overcome such problems, researchers have proposed metaheuristic-based algorithms for searching near-optimum solutions.\nMetaheuristic algorithms are stochastic search methods that mimic the metaphor of biological or physical phenomena. The core of such methods lies on the analysis of collective behaviour of relatively simple agents working on decentralized systems. Such systems typically gather an agent’s population that can communicate to each other while sharing a common environment. Despite a non-centralized control algorithm regulates the agent behaviour, the agent can solve complex tasks by analyzing a given global model and harvesting cooperation to other elements. Therefore, a novel global behaviour evolves from interaction among agents as it can be seen on typical examples that include ant colonies, animal herding, bird flocking, fish schooling, honey bees, bacteria, charged particles and many more. Some other metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been recently proposed to solve optimization problems, such as Genetic Algorithms (GA) [9], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [10], Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [11], Differential Evolution (DE) [12], Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) [13] and Artificial Bee Colony [14] and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) [15].\nElectromagnetism-like algorithm (EMO) is a relatively new population-based meta-heuristic algorithm which was firstly introduced by Birbil and Fang [16] to solve continuous optimization models using bounded variables. The algorithm imitates the attraction–repulsion mechanism between charged particles in an electromagnetic field. Each particle represents a solution and carries a certain amount of charge which is proportional to the solution quality (objective function). In turn, solutions are defined by position vectors which give real positions for particles within a multi-dimensional space. Moreover, objective function values of particles are calculated considering such position vectors. Each particle exerts repulsion or attraction forces over other population members; the resultant force acting over a particle is used to update its position. Clearly, the idea behind the EMO methodology is to move particles towards the optimum solution by exerting attraction or repulsion forces. Unlike other traditional meta-heuristics techniques such as GA, DE, ABC and AIS, whose population members exchange materials or information between each other, the EMO methodology assumes that each particle is influenced by all\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n3\nother particles in the population, mimicking other heuristics methods such as PSO and ACO. Although the EMO algorithm shares some characteristics with PSO and ACO, recent works have exhibited its better accuracy regarding optimal parameters [17-20], yet showing convergence [21]. EMO has been successfully applied to solve different sorts of engineering problems such as flow-shop scheduling [22], communications [23], vehicle routing [24], array pattern optimization in circuits [25], neural network training [26] control systems [27] and image processing [28].\nEMO algorithm employs four main phases: initialization, local search, calculation and movement. The local search procedure is a stochastic search in several directions over all coordinates of each particle. EMO’s main drawback is its computational complexity resulting from the large number of iterations which are commonly required during the searching process. The issue becomes worst as the dimension of the optimization problem increases. Several approaches, which simplify the local search, have been proposed in the literature to reduce EMO’s computational effort. In [29] where Guan et al. proposed a discrete encoding for the particle set in order to reduce search directions at each dimension. In [30] and [31], authors include a new local search method which is based on a fixed search pattern and a shrinking strategy that aims to reduce the population size as the iterative process progresses. Additionally, in [17], a modified local search phase that employs the gradient descent method is adopted to enhance its computational complexity. Although all these approaches have improved the computational time which is required by the original EMO algorithm, recent works [27,32] have demonstrated that reducing or simplifying EMO’s local search processes also affects other important properties, such as convergence, exploration, population diversity and accuracy.\nOn the other hand, the opposition-based learning (OBL), that has been initially proposed in [33], is a machine intelligence strategy which considers the current estimate and its correspondent opposite value (i.e., guess and opposite guess) at the same time to achieve a fast approximation for a current candidate solution. It has been mathematically proved [34-36] that an opposite candidate solution holds a higher probability for approaching the global optimum solution than a given random candidate, yet quicker. Recently, the concept of opposition has been used to accelerate metaheuristic-based algorithms such as GA [37], DE [38], PSO [39] and GSA [40].\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n4\nIn this paper, an Opposition-Based EMO called OBEMO is constructed by combining the oppositionbased strategy and the standard EMO technique. The enhanced algorithm allows a significant reduction on the computational effort which required by the local search procedure yet avoiding any detriment to the good search capabilities and convergence speed of the original EMO algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally tested by means of a comprehensive set of complex benchmark functions. Comparisons to the original EMO and others state-of-the-art EMO-based algorithms [7] demonstrate that the OBEMO technique is faster for all test functions, yet delivering a higher accuracy. Conclusions on the conducted experiments are supported by statistical validation that properly supports the results.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the standard EMO algorithm. Section 3 gives a simple description of OBL and Section 4 explains the implementation of the proposed OBEMO algorithm. Section 5 presents a comparative study among OBEMO and other EMO variants over several benchmark problems. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 6."

It is based on a given population and the optimization of global multi-modal functions. In comparison to GA, it does not use crossover or mutation operators to explore feasible regions; instead it does implement a collective attraction–repulsion mechanism yielding a reduced computational cost with respect to memory allocation and execution time. Moreover, no gradient information is required as it employs a decimal system which clearly contrasts to GA.

If point t observes a better performance over the iteration number ITER, point pg is replaced by t and the\nneighbourhood search for point pg finishes, otherwise pg is held. The pseudo-code is listed in Fig. 1.\nIn general, the local search for all particles can also reduce the risk of falling into a local solution but is time consuming.

By doing so, the fitter one (guess or opposite guess) can be chosen as an initial solution following the fact that, according to probability theory, 50% of the time a guess is further from the solution than its opposite guess [35]. Therefore, starting with the closer of the two guesses (as judged by their fitness values) has the potential to\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n10\naccelerate convergence.

Such groups are formed by OBEMO vs. EMO, OBEMO vs. HEMO and OBEMO vs. FEMO. As a null hypothesis, it is assumed that there is no difference between the values of the two algorithms. The alternative hypothesis considers an actual difference between values from both approaches. The results obtained by the Wilcoxon test indicate that data cannot be assumed as occurring by coincidence (i.e. due to the normal noise contained in the process).\nTable 4 considers the Wilcoxon analysis with respect to the “averaged best value” of f(x). The p-values for the case of OBEMO vs EMO are larger than 0.05 (5% significance level) which is a strong evidence supporting the null hypothesis which indicates that there is no significant difference between both methods. On the other hand, in cases for the p-values corresponding to the OBEMO vs HEMO and OBEMO vs FEMO, they are less than 0.05 (5% significance level), which accounts for a significant difference between the “averaged best value” data among methods. Table 5 considers the Wilcoxon analysis with respect to the “averaged number of executed iterations” values. Applying the same criteria,\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n19\nit is evident that there is a significant difference between the OBEMO vs. EMO case, despite the OBEMO vs HEMO and OBEMO vs FEMO cases offering similar results.\nMultidimensional functions In contrast to the original functions, Multidimensional functions exhibit many local minima/maxima which are, in general, more difficult to optimize. In this section the performance of the OBEMO algorithm is compared to the EMO, the HEMO and the FEMO algorithms, considering functions in Table 2. This comparison reflects the algorithm’s ability to escape from poor local optima and to locate a nearglobal optimum, consuming the least number of iterations. The dimension of such functions is set to 30. The results (Table 6) are averaged over 35 runs reporting the “averaged best value” and the “averaged number of executed iterations” as performance indexes.\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n20\nThe Wilcoxon rank test results, presented in Table 7, shows that the p-values (regarding to the “averaged best value” values of Table 6) for the case of OBEMO vs EMO, indicating that there is no significant difference between both methods. p-values corresponding to the OBEMO vs HEMO and OBEMO vs FEMO show that there is a significant difference between the “averaged best” values among the methods. Figure 7 shows the optimization process for the function and . Such function values correspond to the best case, for each approach, obtained after 35 executions.\nTable 8 considers the Wilcoxon analysis with respect to the “averaged number of executed iterations” values of Table 6.

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, an Opposition-Based EMO, named as OBEMO, has been proposed by combining the opposition-based learning (OBL) strategy and the standard EMO technique. The OBL is a machine intelligence strategy which considers, at the same time, a current estimate and its opposite value to achieve a fast approximation for a given candidate solution. The standard EMO is enhanced by using two OBL steps: the population initialization and the production of new generations. The enhanced algorithm significantly reduces the required computational effort yet avoiding any detriment to the good search capabilities of the original EMO algorithm.\nThis is a preprint copy that has been accepted for publication in International Journal of Innovative Computing,\nInformation and Control\n22\nA set of 14 benchmark test functions has been employed for experimental study. Results are supported by a statistically significant framework (Wilcoxon test [45-47]) to demonstrate that the OBEMO is as accurate as the standard EMO yet requiring a shorter number of iterations. Likewise, it is as fast as others state-of-the-art EMO-based algorithms such as HEMO [7] and FEMO [30], still keeping the original accuracy.\nAlthough the results offer evidence to demonstrate that the Opposition-Based EMO method can yield good results on complicated optimization problems, the paper’s aim is not to devise an optimization algorithm that could beat all others currently available, but to show that the Opposition-based Electromagnetism-like method can effectively be considered as an attractive alternative for solving global optimization problems."
