The system relies on a Random Forest algorithm and 13 unsupervised corpus-based features. We evaluate it with a 10-fold cross validation on 9,600 pairs, equally distributed among the three classes and involving several Parts-Of-Speech (i.e. adjectives, nouns and verbs). When all the classes are present, ROOT13 achieves an F1 score of 88.3%, against a baseline of 57.6% (vector cosine). When the classification is binary, ROOT13 achieves the following results: hypernyms-co-hyponyms (93.4% vs. 60.2%), hypernymsrandom (92.3% vs. 65.5%) and co-hyponyms-random (97.3% vs. 81.5%). Our results are competitive with stateof-the-art models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 10:05:05 GMT  (151kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08705v1", "in AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "in AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["enrico santus", "tin-shing chiu", "qin lu", "alessandro lenci", "chu-ren huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.08705"}
