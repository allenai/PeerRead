      "text" : "The problem of aligning temporal sequences is ubiquitous in applications ranging from bioinformatics [6, 1, 23] to audio processing [5, 7]. The idea is to align two similar time series that have the same global structure but local temporal differences. Most alignments algorithms rely on similarity measures, and having a good metric is crucial, especially in the high-dimensional setting where some features of the signals can be\n∗Both authors contributed equally.\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n31 36\nirrelevant to the alignment task. The goal of this paper is to show how to learn this similarity measure from annotated examples in order to improve the precision of the alignments. For example, in the context of music information retrieval, alignment is used in two different cases: (1) audio-to-audio alignment and (2) audio-to-score alignment. In the first case, the goal is to match two audio interpretations of the same piece that are potentially different in rythm, whereas audio-to-score alignment focuses on matching an audio signal to a symbolic representation of the score. In the second case, there are some attempts to learn from annotated data a measure for performing the alignment. Joder et al. [13] propose to fit a generative model in that context, and Keshet et al. [14] learn this measure in a discriminative setting. Similarly to Keshet et al. [14], we use a discriminative loss to learn the measure, but our work focuses on audio-to-audio alignment. In that context, the set of authorized alignments is much larger, and we explicitly cast the problem as a structured prediction task, that we solve using off-the-shelf stochastic optimization techniques [16] but with proper and significant adjustements, in particular in terms of losses. The need for metric learning goes far beyond unsupervised partitioning problems. Weinberger and Saul [26] proposed a large-margin framework for learning a metric in nearest-neighbour algorithms based on sets of must-link/must-not-link constraints. Lajugie et al. [17] proposed to use a large margin framework to learn a Mahalanobis metric in the context of partitioning problems. Since structured SVM have been proposed by Tsochantaridis et al. [25], Taskar et al. [22], they have successfully been used to solve many learning problems, for instance to learn weights for graph matching [4] or a metric for ranking tasks [18]. They have also been used to learn graph structures using graph cuts [21].\nContributions. We make the following five contributions: (1) we cast the learning of a Mahalanobis metric in the context of alignment as a structured prediction problem, (2) we show that on real musical datasets this metric improves the performance of alignment algorithms using high-level features, (3) we propose to use the metric learning framework to learn combinations of basic audio features and get good alignment performances, (4) we show experimentally that the standard Hamming loss, although tractable computationnally does not permit to learn a relevant similarity measure in some real world settings, (5) we propose a new loss, closer to the true evaluation loss for alignments, leading to a tractable learning task, and derive an efficient Frank-Wolfe based algorithm to deal with this new loss."

      "text" : "In this paper, we consider the alignment problem between two multivariate time series sharing the same dimension p, but possibly of different lengths TA and TB , namely A ∈ RTA×p and B ∈ RTB×p. We refer to the rows of A as a1, . . . , aTA ∈ Rp and\nthose of B as b1, . . . , bTB ∈ Rp. From now on, we denote by X the pair of signals (A,B). Let C(X) ∈ RTA×TB be an arbitrary pairwise affinity matrix associated to the pair X , that is, C(X)i,j encodes the affinity between ai and bj . Note our framework can be extended to the case where A and B are multivariate signals of different dimensions, as long as C(X) is well-defined. The goal of the alignment task is to find two nondecreasing sequences of indices α and β of same length u ≥ max(TA, TB) and to match each time index α(i) in time series A to the time index β(i) in the time series B, in such a way that ∑u i=1 C(X)α(i),β(i) is maximal, and that (α, β) satisfies:  α(1) = β(1) = 1 (matching beginning)\nα(u) = TA, β(u) = TB (matching ending) ∀i, (α(i+ 1), β(i+ 1))− (α(i), β(i)) ∈ {(1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)} (three type of moves)\n(1) For a given (α, β), we define the binary matrix Y ∈ {0, 1}TA×TB such that Yα(i),β(i) = 1 for every i ∈ {1, . . . , u} and 0 otherwise. We denote by Y(X) the set of such matrices, which is uniquely determined by TA and TB . An example is given in Fig. 1. A vertical move in the Y matrix means that the signal B is waiting for A and an horizontal one that A is waiting for B. In this sense we can say that the time reference is “warped”. When C(X) is known, the alignment task can be cast as the following linear program (LP) over the set Y(X):\nmax Y ∈Y(X)\nTr(C(X)>Y ). (2)\nOur goal is to learn how to form the affinity matrix: once we have learned C(X), the alignment is obtained from Eq. (2). The optimization problem in Eq. (2) will be referred to as the decoding of our model.\nDynamic time warping. Given the affinity matrix C(X) associated with the pair of signals X = (A,B), finding the alignment that solves the LP of Eq. (2) can be done efficiently in O(TATB) using a dynamic programming algorithm. It is often referred to as dynamic time warping [6, 19]. This algorithm is described in Alg. 1 of the supplementary material. Various additional constraints may be used in the dynamic time warping algorithm [19], which we could easily add. The cardinality of the set Y(X) is huge: it corresponds to the number of paths on a rectangular grid from the southwest (1, 1) to the northeast corner (TA, TB) with only vertical, horizontal and diagonal moves allowed. This is the definition of the Delannoy numbers [2]. As noted in [24], when t = TA = TB is big, one can show that #Yt,s ∼\n(3+2 √ 2)t\n√ πt √ 3 √ 2−4 ."

That is, C(X) is parametrized by a matrix W ∈ W ⊂ Rp×p, where W ⊂ Rp×p is the set of semi-definite positive matrices, and we use the corresponding Mahalanobis metric to compute the pairwise affinity between ai and bj : C(X;W )i,j = −(ai − bj)>W (ai − bj).

      "heading" : "3.1 Losses between alignments",
      "text" : "In our framework, the alignments are encoded by matrices in Y(X), thus we are interested in functions ` : Y(X) × Y(X) → R+. Let us define the Frobenius norm by ‖M‖2F = ∑ i,jM 2 i,j .\nHamming loss. A simple loss between matrices is the Frobenius norm of their difference, which turns out to be the unnormalized Hamming loss [10] for 0/1 valued matrices. For two matrices Y1, Y2 ∈ Y(X), it is defined as:\n`H(Y1, Y2) = ‖Y1 − Y2‖2F (4) = Tr(Y >1 Y1) + Tr(Y > 2 Y2)− 2 Tr(Y >1 Y2)\n= Tr(Y11TB1 > TA) + Tr(Y21TB1 > TA)− 2 Tr(Y > 1 Y2),\nwhere 1T is the vector of RT with all coordinates equal to 1. The last line of Eq. (4) comes from the fact that the Yi have 0− 1 values; that makes the Hamming loss linear in Y1 and Y2. This loss is often used in other structured prediction tasks [16]. In the audio-to-score setting, Keshet et al. [14] use a modified version of this loss, which is the average number of times the difference between the two alignments is greater than a fixed threshold. This loss is easy to optimize since it is linear in our parametrization of the alignement problem, but not optimal for audio-to-audio alignment. Indeed, a major drawback of the Hamming loss is, for alignments of fixed length, it depends only on the number of “crossings” between alignment paths: one can easily find Y1, Y2, Y3 such that `H(Y2, Y1) = `H(Y3, Y1) but Y2 is intuitively much closer to Y1 than Y3 (see Fig. 2). It is important to notice this is often the case as the length of the signals grows.\nArea loss. A more natural loss can be computed as the mean distance beween the paths depicted by two matrices Y 1, Y 2 ∈ Y(X). This loss is represented by the grey zone on Fig. 1 and corresponds to the area between the paths of two matrices Y . Formally, as in Fig. 1, for each t ∈ {1, . . . , TB} we define δt as the minimum between |min{k, Y 1k,t = 1} − max{k, Y 2k,t = 1}| and |max{k, Y 1k,t = 1} − min{k, Y 2k,t = 1}|. Then the area loss is the mean of the δt. In the audio literature [15], this loss is sometimes called the “mean absolute deviation” loss and is noted δabs(Y 1, Y 2). Unfortunately, in the general case of alignment problem δabs is not linear in the matrices Y . But in the context of alignment of sequences of two different nature, one of the signal is a reference and thus the index sequence α defined in Eq. (1) is increasing, e.g. for the audio to partition alignment problem [13]. This loss is then linear in each of its arguments. More precisely, if we introduce the matrices L ∈ RTA×TA which is lower triangular with ones, we can write the loss as\n`O = ‖L(Y1 − Y2)‖2F (5) = Tr(LY11TB1 > TA) + Tr(LY21TB1 > TA)− 2 Tr(LY1Y > 2 L >).\nWe now prove that this loss corresponds to the area loss in this special case. Let Y be an alignment matrix and L ∈ RTA×TA be the matrix such that Lr,s = 1 if and only if\nr ≥ s. Then it is easy see that (LY )i,j = ∑ k Li,kYk,j = ∑i k=0 Yk,j . If Y does not have vertical moves, i.e. for each j there is an unique kj such that Yk,j = 1, we have that (LY )i,j = 1 if and only if i ≥ kj . So ∑ i,j(LY )i,j = #{(i, j), i ≥ kj}, which is exactly the area under the curve determined by the path of Y . In all our experiments, we use δabs for evaluation but not for training.\nApproximation of the area loss: the symmetrized area loss. In many real world applications [15], the best loss to assess the quality of an alignment is the area loss. As shown by our experiments, if the Hamming loss is sufficient in some simple situations and allows to learn a metric that leads to good alignment performance in terms of area loss, on more challenging datasets it does not work at all (see Sec. 5). This is due to the fact that two alignments that are very close in terms of area loss can suffer a big Hamming loss. In Fig. 2, we provide examples where the Hamming loss is not sufficient to assess performance. Thus it is natural to extend the formulation of Eq. (5) to matrices in Y(X). We first start by symmetrizing the formulation of Eq. (5) to overcome problems of overpenalization of vertical vs. horizontal moves. Let L1 ∈ RTB×TB be the matrix such that Lr,s = 1 if and only if r ≥ s. We define, for any binary matrices Y 1 and Y 2,\n`S(Y1, Y2) = 1\n2\n( ‖L(Y1 − Y2)‖F + ‖(Y1 − Y2)L1)‖2F ) (6)\n= 1\n2\n[ Tr(Y >1 L >LY1) + Tr(LY21TB1 > TA)− 2 Tr(Y > 2 L >LY1)\n+ Tr(Y1L1L > 1 Y ) + Tr(Y > 2 1TA1TBL1L > 1 Y2)− 2 Tr(Y2L1L>1 Y >1\n)] .\nWe propose to use the following trick to obtain a concave loss over Y(X), the convex hull ofY(X). Let us introduceD = λmax(L>L)ITA×TA andD1 = λmax(L1L>1 )ITB×TB with λmax(U) the largest eigenvalue of U . For any binary matrices Y1, Y2, we have that:\n`S(Y1, Y2) = 1\n2\n[ Tr(Y >1 (L >L−D)Y1) + Tr(DY11TB1>TA)\n+ Tr(LY21TB1 > TA)− 2 Tr(Y > 2 (L >L−D)Y1) + Tr(Y1(L1L > 1 −D)Y ) + Tr(Y1D11TB1>TA)\nTr(Y >2 L1L > 1 Y2)− 2 Tr(Y2L1L>1 Y >1 ) ] and we get a concave function over Y(X) that coincides with `S on Y(X)."

      "text" : "In this section we describe a large margin approach to solve a surrogate to the problem in Eq. (7), which is untractable. As shown by Eq. (3), the decoding task is the maximum of a linear function in the parameter W and aims at predicting an output over a large and discrete space (the space of potential alignments with respect to the constraints in Eq. (1)). Learning W thus falls in the structured prediction framework [25, 22]. We define the hinge-loss, a convex surrogate to `, by\nL(X,Y ;W ) = max Y ′∈Y(X)\n{ `(Y, Y ′)− Tr(W> [φ(X,Y )− φ(X,Y ′)]) } .

Among the aforementionned losses, the Hamming loss `H is the only one leading directly to a tractable loss-augmented decoding problem and thus that falls directly into the structured prediction framework. Indeed, plugging Eq. (4) into (8) leads to a lossaugmented decoding that is a LP over the set Y(X) and that can therefore be solved using the dynamic time warping algorithm. If we define Ŷ i as the argmax in Eq. (8) when (X,Y ) = (Xi, Y i), then elementary computations show that\nŶ i = argmin Y ∈YTA,TB Tr((U> − 2Y i> − C(Xi;W )>)Y ),\nwhere U = 1TB1 > TB ∈ RTA×TB .

From Eq. (3), one can notice that our joint feature map is linear in Y . Thus, if we take a loss that is linear in the first argument of `, for instance the Hamming loss, the loss-augmented decoding is the maximization of a linear function over the spaces Y(X) that we can do efficiently using dynamic programming algorithms (see Sec. 2.1 and supplementary material). That way, plugging the Hamming loss (Eq. (4)) in Eq. (9) leads to a convex structured prediction problem. This problem can be solved using standard techniques such that cutting plane methods [12], stochastic gradient descent [20], or block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe in the dual [16]. Note that we adapted the standard unconstrained optimization methods to our setting, where W 0.\nOptimization using the symmetrized area loss. In this section we propose to show that it is possible to deal The symmetrized area loss is concave in its first argument, thus the problem of Eq. 9 using it is in a min/max form and thus deriving a dual is straightforward. Details can be found in the supplementary material. If we plug the symmetrized area loss `S (SAL) defined in Eq. (6) into our problem (9), we can show that the dual of (9) has the following form:\nmin (Z1,...,Zn)∈Y\n1 2λn2 ‖ ∑n i=1− ∑ j,k(Yi − Zi)j,k(aj − bk)(aj − bk)T ‖2F\n− 1n ∑n i=1 `S(Z,Z i), (10)\nif we denote by Y(Xi) the convex hull of the sets Y(Xi), and by Y the cartesian product over all the training examples i of such sets. Note that we recover a similar result as [16]. Since the SAL loss is concave, the aforrementionned problem is convex. The problem (10) is a quadratic program over the compact set Z . Thus we can use a Frank-Wolfe [8] algorithm. Note that it is similar to the one proposed by Lacoste-Julien et al. [16] but with supplementary term due to the concavity of the loss."

The N = 60 pairs are stretched along two different tempo curves.

Those were: five MFCC [9] (labeled M1,. . . ,M5 in Fig. 3), the spectral flatness (SF), the spectral centroid (SC), the spectral spread (SS), the maximum of the envelope (Max), and the power level of each frame (Pow), see [15] for more details on the computation of the features.

We were able to combine hand-crafted features, as well as building automatically new state-of-the-art features from basic low-level information with very little expert knowledge. Technically, this is made possible by considering a loss beyond the usual Hamming loss which is typically used because it is “practical” within a structured prediction framework (linear in the output representation). The present work may be extended in several ways, the main one being to consider cases where only partial information about the alignments is available. This is often the case in music [5] or bioinformatics applications. Note a simple alternating optimization between metric learning and constrained alignment provide a simple first solution, which could probably be improved upon."

      "text" : "A.1 Relaxing the set for loss augmented inference. Let us start from the global structured objective equation of the paper. Recall that we dispose of the training examples ((X1, Y 1), . . . , (Xn, Y n)). In order to make the derivation easier, and following Lacoste-Julien et al. [16], we denote the difference between the feature map associated to any Y ∈ Y(Xi) and the one associated to the true training example label Yi by: Tr(Wφ(Xi, Y i)) = Tr(W ∑ j,k(Y i j,k − Yj,k)(aij − bik)(a i j − bik)T ) = 〈W,ψi(Y )〉. The objective of structured prediction is thus:\nmin W∈W\nλ 2 ‖W‖22 + 1 n n∑ i=1 max Y ∈Y(Xi) { `i(Y, Y i)− 〈W,ψi(Y )〉 } . (11)\nThe term maxY ∈Y(Xi) { `i(Y, Y i)− 〈W,ψi(Y )〉 }\ncorresponds to the structural hinge loss for our problem. Let us introduce Y(Xi) the convex hull of the sets Y(Xi). We will also use Y = Y(X1) × . . . × Y(Xn). From now on, we will perform the loss augmented decoding on this relaxed set. This problem has potentially non integral\nsolutions. We call the maximization of the hinge loss over Y the loss augmented inference. Now we can write a new optimization objective:\nmin W∈W\nλ 2 ‖W‖22 + max\n(Z1,...,Zn)∈Y\n{ 1\nn n∑ i=1 [ `i(Zi, Y\ni)− 〈W,ψi(Zi)〉 ]} . (12)\nNote that since our joint feature map φ(Xi, Y ) is linear in Y , if ` is linear as well (for instance if ` is the Hamming loss), this problem is strictly equivalent to (11) since in that case, the loss-augmented inference is a LP over Y(Xi), which has necessary a solution in Y(Xi) (see, e.g, [Prop. B.21] of [3]. In general, in order to be convex and thus tractable, the aforrementioned problem requires a loss which is concave over the convex sets Y(Xi).\nA.2 Dual of the structured SVM Since Prob. (11) is in saddle point form, we get the dual by switching the max and the min:\nmax (Z1,...,Zn)∈Y(X1)×...×Y(Xn) min W∈W\nλ 2 ‖W‖22 + { 1 n n∑ i=1 [ `i(Y, Y i)− 〈W,ψi(Zi)〉 ] }.\n(13) From the above equation, we deduce the following relation linking primal variable W and dual variables (Z1, . . . , Zn) ∈ Y(X1)× . . .× Y(Xn): In the specific case whenW is unconstrained and simply equals to Rp×p, this reduces to:\nW = 1\nλ n∑ i=1 ψi(Zi).

Eventually if we consider W the set of diagonal matrices, and denote by Diag the operator associating to a matrix the matrix composed of its diagonal:\nW = 1\nλ n∑ i=1 Diag(ψi(Zi)). (16)\nThese relations are also known as the “representer theorems”. For what follows we consider the case ofW = Rp×p but dealing with the other cases is similar. In that case the dual can be written simply as:\nmax (Z1,...,Zn)∈Y(X1)×...×Y(Xn) − 1 2λn2 ‖ n∑ i=1 ψi(Zi)‖2F + 1 n n∑ i=1 `(Yi, Zi).

(17) Now, we can derivate a Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the dual problem of 17. As noted in the paper, we are able to maximize or minimize any linear form over the sets Y(Xi), thus we are able to solve LPs over the convex hulls Y(Xi) of such sets. Plugging back the specific form of our joint feature map directly into Eq. (17) we get that ψi(Zi) = − ∑ j,k(Yi−Zi)j,k(aj − bk)(aj − bk)T and thus we can write the dual problem as:\nmin (Z1,...,Zn)∈\nY(X1)×...×Y(Xn)\n1\n2λn2 ‖ n∑ i=1 − ∑ j,k (Yi − Zi)j,k(aj − bk)(aj − bk)T ‖2F − 1 n n∑ i=1 `(Y i, Zi) (18)\nNow, as in the paper, let us introduce L ∈ RTA×TA and L1 ∈ RTB×TB . If Ui is the matrix of ones of the same size as Zi, we consider the following loss:\n`(Y i, Zi) = 1\n2\n[ Tr(ZiT (LTL−D)Zi) + Tr(DZiU i) + Tr(Y iTLTLi)− 2 Tr(ZiTLTLY i)\n+ Tr(Zi(LT1 L1 −D1)Zi) + Tr(D1ZiU i) + Tr(Y iLT1 Li1)− 2 Tr(ZLT1 L1Y i) ] .(19)\nThis loss is sound for alignments problems since, when Yi and Zi are in Y , this is simply the `S loss ‖LYi − LZi‖2F + ‖YiL1 − ZiL1‖2F . Thus we get the following overall dual objective:\nmin (Z1,...,Zn)∈Y\n1\n2λn2 ‖ n∑ i=1 − ∑ j,k (Yi − Zi)j,k(aj − bk)(aj − bk)T ‖2F\n− 1 n ( n∑ i=1 [Tr(ZiT (LTL−D)Zi) + Tr(ZiTDU i) +\nTr(Y TLTLi)− 2 Tr(ZiTLTLY i) + Tr(Zi(LT1 L1 −D1)ZiT ) + Tr(UiD1Z i) + Tr(Y LT1 L i 1)− 2 Tr(ZLT1 L1Y iT ) ] ). (20)\nWe recall that D is a diagonal matrix such that A>A−D 0 and thus our objective is convex. Our dynamic programming algorithm (DTW) is able to maximize any linear function over the sets. Thus we can use a Frank-Wolfe [8] technique. At iteration t, this algorithm iteratively computes a linearization of the function at the current point (Z1, . . . Zn)k, computes a linearization of the function, optimize it, get a new point (Z1, . . . Zn)∗kand then make a convex combination using a stepsize γ. Note that we have directly a stochastic version of such an algorithm. As noted in Lacoste-Julien et al. [16] instead of computing a gradient for each block of variable Zi, we simply need to choose randomly one block at each timestep and make an update on these variables. The linearization simply consists in computing the matrix gradient for each of the matrix variables Zi which turns out to be:\n∇Zi(g) = 1n [ C − 12 ( 2(LTL−D)Zi +DUi − 2LTLY i\n+ 2Zi(LT1 L1 −D) + UiD − 2Y iLTL )]\n(21)\nwhere C is simply the affinity matrix of dynamic time warping."

Intuitively, the cost matrix is the opposite of a cost matrix, thus we aim to maximize the cumulated affinity instead of minimizing the cumulated cost. This algorithm is O(TATB), making it very costly to compute for large time series."
