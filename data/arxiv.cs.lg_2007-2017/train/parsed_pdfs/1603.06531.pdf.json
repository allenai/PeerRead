      "text" : "Human beings, as social animals, rely on a vast array of methods to communicate with each other in the society. Non-verbal communication, that includes body language and gestures, is an essential aspect of interpersonal communication. In fact, studies have shown that non-verbal communication accounts for more than half of all societal interactions [Frith 2009]. Studying facial gestures is therefore of vital importance in fields like sociology, psychology and automated recognition of gestures can be applied towards creating more user affable software and user agents in these fields.\nAutomatic gesture recognition has wide implications in the field of human computer interaction. As technology progresses, we spend large amounts of our time looking at screens, interacting with computers and mobile phones. In spite of their wide usage, majority of software interfaces are still non-verbal, impersonal, primitive and terse. Adding emotion recognition and tailoring responses towards users emotional state can help improve human computer interaction drastically [Cowie et al. 2001; Zhang et al. 2015] and help keep users engaged. Such technologies can then be applied towards improvement of workplace productivity, education and telemedicine [Kołakowska et al. 2014]. Last two decades have seen some innovation in this area [Klein and Picard 1999; Cerezo et al. 2007;\nAndré et al. 2000] such as humanoid robots for example Pepper which can both understand and mimic human emotions.\nModeling and parameterizing human faces is one of the most fundamental problems in computer graphics [Liu et al. 2014a]. Understanding and classification of gestures from videos can have applications towards better modeling of human faces in computer graphics and human computer interaction. Accurate characterization of face geometry and muscle motion can be used for both expression identification and synthesis [Pighin et al. 2006; Wang et al. 2013] with applications towards computer animation [Cassell et al. 1994]. Such approaches combine very high dimensional facial features from facial topology and compress them to lower dimensions using a series of parameters or transformations [Waters 1987; Pyun et al. 2003]. This paper demonstrates how to use deep neural networks to reduce dimensionality of high information facial videos and recover the embedded temporal and spatial information by utilizing a series of stacked autoencoders.\nOver the past decade algorithms for training neural nets have dramatically evolved, allowing us to efficiently train deep neural nets [Hinton et al. 2006; Jung et al. 2015]. Such models have become a strong driving force in modern computer vision and excel at object classification [Krizhevsky et al. 2012], segmentation and facial recognition [Taigman et al. 2014]. In this paper we apply deep neural nets for recognizing and classifying facial gestures, while pushing forward several architectures. We obtain high level information in both space and time by implementing 4D convolutional layers and training an autoencoder on videos. Most of neural net applications use still images as input and rely on convolutional architectures for automatically learning semantic information in spatial domain. Second, we reface an old challenge in learning theory, where not all datasets are labeled. Known as semi-supervised learning, this problem, once again, attracts attention as deep nets require massive datasets to outperform other architectures. Finally, we provide details of a new normalization layer, which robustly handles temporal lighting changes within the network itself. This new architecture is adaptively fine tuned as part of the learning process, and outperforms all other reported techniques for the tested datasets. We summarize our contributions as follows: ar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 53\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2"

      "text" : "Machine learning strategies such as random forests or SVMs combined with local binary features (or sometimes facial fiducial points) have been used for facial expression recognition in the past [Kotsia and Pitas 2007; Michel and El Kaliouby 2003; Shan et al. 2005; Dhall et al. 2011; Walecki et al. 2015; Presti and Cascia 2015; Vieriu et al. 2015]. Other intriguing methodologies include performing emotion recognition through speech [Nwe et al. 2003; Schuller et al. 2004], using temporal features and manifold learning [Liu et al. 2014b; Wang et al. 2013; Kahou et al. 2015; Chen et al. 2015] and combining multiple kernel based approaches [Liu et al. 2014c; Senechal et al. 2015]. Majority of such systems involve a pipeline with multiple stages - face discovery, face alignment, feature extraction and landmark localization followed by classification of labels as the final step. Our approach combines all of these phases (after face detection) into the neural net which takes entire video clip as input.\nRecently, deep neural nets have triumphed over traditional vision algorithms, thereby dominating the world of computer vision. Deep neural networks have proven to be an effective tool to classify and segment high dimensional data such as images [Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Szegedy et al. 2015], audio and videos [Karpathy et al. 2014; Tran et al. 2014]. With advances in convolutional neural nets, we have seen neural nets applied for face detection [Taigman et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2015] and expression recognition [Abidin and Harjoko 2012; Gargesha and Kuchi 2002; He et al. 2015] but these\nnetworks were not deep enough or used other feature extraction techniques like PCA or Fisherface. By contrast this paper proposes an end to end system which takes a sequence of frames as input and gives classification labels as output while using deep autoencoders to generate high dimensional spatio-temporal features.\nWhile deep neural nets are notorious for stellar results, training a neural net can be challenging because of huge data requirements. A way around this is to use autoencoders for feature extraction or weights initialization [Vincent et al. 2008], followed by fine tuning over a smaller labeled dataset. This issue can also be solved using embeddings in lower dimensional manifold [Weston et al. 2012; Kingma et al. 2014] or pre-train using pseudo labels [Lee 2013] thereby requiring fewer number of labeled samples. Approaches based on semi supervised learning have shown to work for smaller labeled datasets [Papandreou et al. 2015] and techniques using deep neural nets to combine labels and unlabeled data in the same architecture [Liu et al. 2014d; Kahou et al. 2013] have emerged victorious. In this paper we propose similar hybrid approaches incorporating deep autoencoders for unlabeled data and additive loss function for the classification tasks.\nIntroducing invariants in neural networks is an area of active research, some examples include illumination invariant face recognition techniques [Mathur et al. 2008; Li et al. 2004] and deep lambertian networks [Tang et al. 2012; Jung et al. 2015]. Our method tries to introduce similar invariants for video neural networks by introducing temporal invariants to illumination. While we test our techniques on facial gesture datasets, in principal they can be extended to any neural network taking videos as input. In [Anonymous Submission 2016], the author considered velocity changes in videos as well as a semi-supervised learning approach. Here we focus on a different neural network topology and parameter calibration, and report better results on similar databases using new invariant layers."

      "text" : "Stacked autoencoders can be used to convert high dimensional data into lower dimensional space which can be useful for classification, visualization or retrieval [Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006]. Since video data is extremely high dimensional we rely on a deep convolutional autoencoder to extract meaningful features from this data by embedding it into R4096. The autoencoder topology is inspired by ImageNet [Krizhevsky et al. 2012] and comprises of convolutional layers gradually reducing data dimensionality until we reach a fully connected layer. Central fully connected layers are followed by a cascade of deconvolutional layers which essentially invert the convolutional layers thereby reconstructing the input tensor (R145×145×9). The complete autoencoder architecture can be described in following shorthandC(96, 11, 3)−N−C(256, 5, 2)− N−C(384, 3, 2)−N−FC(4096)−FC(4096)−DC(96, 11, 3)− N −DC(256, 5, 2)−N −DC(384, 3, 2). Here C(96, 11, 3) is a\nconvolutional layer containing 96 filters of size 11 × 11 in spatial domain and spanning 3 frames in temporal domain. N stands for local response normalization layers,DC stands for deconvolutional layers and FC(4096) stands for fully connected layers containing 4096 neurons.\nIn the same way that spatial convolutions consolidate nearby spatial characteristics of an image, we use the slow fusion model described in [Karpathy et al. 2014] to gradually combine temporal features across multiple frames. We implement slow fusion by extending spatial convolution to the temporal domain and adding representation of filter stride for both space and time domains. This allows us to control filter size and stride in both temporal and spatial domains leading to a generalized 3D convolution over spatiotemporal input tensor followed by 4D convolutions on intermediate layers. The first convolutional layer sets temporal size and stride as 3 and 2 respectively whereas the subsequent layer has both size and stride of 2 in temporal domain. Finally the third convolutional layer merges temporal information from all frames together, culminating in a lower dimensional vector of size 4096 at the innermost layer.\nSince weight initialization is critical for convergence in a deep autoencoder, we use pre-training for each convolutional layer as we add the layers on. Instead of initializing all weights at once and training from there, we train the first and last layer first, followed by the next convolutional layer and so on. We discuss this in detail in section 5.1."

Notice that our autoencoder architecture is overlaid on top of the predictor architecture by adding deconvolutional layers after the first fully connected layer to create a semisupervised topology which is capable of training both autoencoder and predictor together (see Figure 3). We use autoencoder to initialize weights for all convolutional layers, all deconvolutional layers and central fully connected layers and we initialize any remaining layers randomly. We use stochastic gradient descent to train weights by combining losses from both predictor and autoencoder while training, this combined loss function for the semi-supervised\nlearner is described in the equation 1.\nL = −β ∑ j yj log ( eoj∑ k e ok ) + α||x̄− x̄o||2 (1)\nEquation 1 defines semi-supervised learner loss by combining the loss terms from predictor and autoencoder neural networks. Here yj refers to the input labels to represent each facial expression uniquely while ok are the outputs from the final layer of predictor neural net. Also x̄ is the input tensor (∈ R145×145×9) and x̄o is the corresponding output from autoencoder. Autoencoder loss is the Euclidean loss between input and output tensors given by ||x̄−x̄o||2 whereas− ∑ j yj log ( e oj∑\nk e ok\n) is the softmax loss from\nthe predictor [Bengio et al. 2005]. Each step of stochastic gradient descent is performed over a batch of 22 inputs and loss is obtained by adding loss terms for the entire batch. At the commencement of training of the predictor layers, we select values of β which make softmax loss term an order of magnitude higher than the Euclidean loss term (see equation 1). We continue training predictor layers by gradually decreasing loss coefficient α alongside of softmax loss to prevent overfitting of autoencoder. Amalgamation of predictor and autoencoder architectures is depicted in Figure 2."

      "text" : "We introduce scale invariance to pixel intensities by adding additional layers as an illumination invariant neural network in the beginning of semi-supervised learner. The illumination invariant layers include a convolutional layer, an absolute value layer, a reciprocal layer followed by a Hadamard product layer. Scale invariance is achieved by applying element wise multiplication between the output layers of proposed architecture and the original input layer. This normalization can be written as C(9, 1, 9) − Abs − Log(α, β) − Exp(−γ, δ)−Prod(x1, x2) (please refer to shorthand notation in section 3.1). Here C(9, 1, 9) refers to the first convolutional layer containing 9 filters with size 1 × 1 in spatial domain and a size of 9 in time domain. Abs is a fixed layer to compute absolute value, Log(α, β) layer computes the function ln(α∗x+β) andExp(γ, δ) layer gives us eγ∗x+δ . In the end Prod(x1, x2) layer takes two in-\nputs (x1, x2) and multiplies the output of exponential layer (x2) with the original input tensor (x1). If F̄ (x̄) denotes function emulated by first convolution layer, we can write the transfer function of this sub-net as follows (equation 2).\nH(x̄) = x̄e−γlog(α|F̄ (x̄)|+β)+δ = eδx̄\n(α|F̄ (x̄)|+ β)γ (2)\nLog and Exp layers are used to generate a reciprocal layer by setting meta-parameters γ to 1 and δ to zero. We can also ”switch off” this sub-net by setting both of these parameters to zero. Transfer function meta parameters α (scale) and β (shift) can be tuned as well for optimal performance. We perform a grid search to find optimal values for these after re-characterizing the transfer function parameters as a global multiplicative factor τ and a proportion factor η (see equation 3). Table 1 shows results for various choices of α and β. We can reformulate equation 2 as given below:\nH(x̄) = e0x̄\n(α|F̄ (x̄)|+ β)1 =\n1 β x̄\n1 + α β |F̄ (x̄)|\n= τ x̄\n1 + η|F̄ (x̄)| (3)\nThe output from scale invariant neural net is a 145 × 145 × 9 tensor which is used as input in the autoencoder and predictor neural networks. The convolution layer can be parametrized using a 9 × 1 × 1 × 9 tensor and changes during fine tuning while α and β are fixed constants greater than zero. In our experiments we initialized convolutional filter of scale invariant sub-net using several approaches, such as partial derivatives, mellin transform, moving average and laplacian kernel and found that it performed best when using neighborhood averaging.

We further enhanced the data quality by removing any clips which showed high variation in-between consecutive frames. This eliminated video clips containing accidental appearance of occlusions, rapid facial motions or sudden appearance of another face.\nAs an additional step we obtained the facial pose information by using active appearance models and generating facial landmarks\n[Asthana et al. 2014]. We fitted the facial landmarks to a 3D deformable model and restricted our dataset to clips containing less than 30 degrees of yaw, pitch or roll, thereby eliminating faces looking sideways. For data generation, we relied on daily feeds from news sources such as CNN, MSNBC, FOX and CSPAN.

Currently, our system relies on utilization of Viola-Jones to distinguish and segment out the faces and is limited to analyzing only the front facing views. Emotion recognition in the wild still remains an elusive problem with low reported accuracies which we hope will be addresses in future work.\nIn this work we only considered video frames but other, richer, modalities could be taken into account. Sound, for example, has a direct influence on the emotional status and can improve our current system. Higher refresh rates, multi-resolution in space and time, or interactions between our subjects are just few of many possibilities\nwhich can to enrich our data and can lead to better classification or inference.\nDeep neural networks have proven to be extremely effective in solving computer vision problems even though training them at large scale continues to be both CPU and memory intensive.

      "heading" : "6.1 Limitations",
      "text" : "In this section we explore limitations of our system and discuss where our system may fail or be of less value. One of our greatest limitations is that the system was built and tested using only frontal perspectives thereby imposing a constraint on the input facial orientations. Further the pipeline takes a fixed number of video frames as input which imposes a restriction on minimum number of frames required for recognition. We restrict individual frames to a fixed size of 140× 140 and higher resolution frames need to be resized which may lead to information loss. Both spatio and temporal\nsize constraints can be improved by increasing neural network size at the cost of computing resources.\nLearning for deep neural networks can be extremely computationally intensive and can impose massive constraints on systemic space-time complexity. Our system is no different and requires specialized hardware (NVIDIA TeslaTMor K40TMGrid GPUs) with a minimum of 9 GB of VRAM on the graphics card for lowest of batch sizes. Deep autoencoders can be data intensive and require millions of unlabeled samples to train. Further the stacked autoencoder we train takes over 3 days to train requiring an additional day to fine tune predictor weights for larger labeled datasets. Even though the system supports 7 emotions and 1 neutral face state, it was not trained to detect neutral emotions - a constraint which can be fixed by adding more labeled data for neutral facial gestures. The pipeline only recognizes 7 facial emotions but recent research shows that there is a much wider range of emotions. Even though neural networks win in a lot of scenarios, a lot more research needs to be done to understand exactly how and why they work."
