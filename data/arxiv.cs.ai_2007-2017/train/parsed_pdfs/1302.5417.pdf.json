      "text" : "The recent growth in technology made\ninformation retrieval as an emerging technique.\nHowever, the current retrieval methods are\nessentiallybased on the string matching approach\nwith the lack of semantic information and cannot\nunderstand the user’s queryrequirement verywell.\nRecall ratio and precision ratio can only be\nincreased by semantic intelligence of retrieval\nsystems.Thesedealswithextendingtheexistingweb\nwith conceptual metadata are more useful to\nmachines.\nFacet-based as well as traditional\nkeyword based method retrieval operations are\ncarried out based on the vocabulary. There is a\ncertain degree of semantic missing. Ontologyas a\nbasis for the sharingof knowledge has been widely\nused in information science. Ontologies define\ndomain concepts and the relationships between\nthem, and thus provide a domain language that is\nmeaningful to bothhumans and machines.\nOntologies are being defined for poultry\nscience. The field poultry comes under veterinary\nscience as animal husbandry. Poultry has two\nvarieties of chickens. They are broadly classified\ninto layers and broilers. The parents of layer chicks\nare White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red whereas\nWhite Cornish for the broiler birds. Layer birds are\nmainlymeant for egg production and broiler birds\nare for meat production. The domains can further\nbe classified into manyclasses and subclasses. The\nconcepts from these ontologies can be used to\nannotate web resources. The web ontology\nlanguage (OWL) is widelyaccepted as the standard\nlanguage for sharing semantic web contents and is\nimplemented through Protégé OWL.\nProtégé is an ontology development\nenvironmentwithalargecommunityofactiveusers.\nProtégé has been extended with support for OWL,\nand has become one of the leading OWL tools.\nThe goal of this paper is to help poultry\nprojects to get started with semantic web\ntechnology. This paper describes the classification\nofpoultryscienceamongthedomains involved in it\nusing protégé. This also defines the classes,\nproperties and features such as reasoners to check\nsemantic consistency. Finally, the paper shows the\ngraphical view of the classes, generated RDF\nschemas and XML scripts which is used to link\nexisting web resources into the semantic web."

      "text" : "PROTÉGÉ\nOWL ontology can be depicted as a\nnetwork of classes, properties and individuals. Classes define names of the relevant domain conceptsand their logical characteristics.Properties (also called as roles, attributes or slots) that defines relationships between classes, and allow assigning primitive values to instances. Individuals are instances of the classes with specific values for the properties[1].\nThe semantic web can be regarded as a\nnetwork of ontologies and other web resources[1]. OWL ontology concepts can have references to concepts in otherontologies. The basic mechanism for this capability is ontologyimport (i.e., ontology can import resources from existing ontologies and create instances or specializations of their classes)"
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.1 Classes",
      "text" : "The important view in the Protégé OWL\nplugin is the OWL classes. Classes describe concepts in the domain. This tab displays the tree of the ontology’s classes on the left. The upper region of the class is shown in a form in the center. This form allows users to edit class metadata such as name, comments, and labels, in multiple languages. The widget in the right area of the form allows users to assign values for properties and description to a class.\nAnnotation properties can be used to add\ninformation (metadata-data about data) to classes. Ontologies can define their own annotation properties or reuse existingones suchas those from the Dublin core ontology [1]. In contrast to other properties, annotation properties do not have any formal meaningforexternalOWLcomponents like reasoners, but they are an extremely important vehicleformaintainingproject information.Atypical use for annotation property in poultry field is to\ndesign concept that describes functionalityof each class.\nIn thispaper manyclasses andsub classes\nhave been created under the field of poultry but due to lack of space only some of the classes are described elaborately.\nHere, the class Health monitoring and\ndisease control is a sub class of Breeder farm management and it has two sub classes namelybio security and vaccination. The class vaccination is again sub divided into a sub class prevention of diseases. The classification further proceeds to a large number of classes and sub classes. The representation of classes is depicted in Figure 1.\nThe editingof classes in carried out using\nthe classes tab shown in Figure 2. The initial class hierarchy tree view should resemble the picture shown in Figure 2. The empty ontology contains one class called Thing. The class Thing is the class that represents the set containing all individuals. Because of this all classes are subclasses of Thing [2]. To add a class, the classes tab is selected, add subclass button is pressed. This creates a new class as a subclass of the selected class Thing."

      "heading" : "2.2 Properties",
      "text" : "The properties widget of the OWL\nclasses tab allows users to view and create relationships between classes. It provides access to those properties that could be used by the instancesof thecurrent class.Thecharacteristics of a propertyare edited through the form shown in Figure 4. This form provides a metadata area in the upper part, displaying the property’s name, annotations andso on, similar to the presentation in the class form.\nThere are two main types of properties\nviz. Object properties and Datatype properties. Object properties are relation between two individuals. Object properties link an individual to an individual whereas datatype property link an individual to an XML Schema Datatype valueor an RDF literal (ie.Theydescribe relationship between an individual and data values). OWL also has another propertynamed annotation property, which is used to add information (ie.metadata - data about data)\nto classes, individuals and object/datatype properties.\nThis paper implements about twelve\nproperties. Some of them are listed in the Table 1. Each of the propertyhas its own characteristics and are described in Table 2. Each and every attribute of the property are independent and each has its own characteristics.\nobject properties namely hasPreventive measure, isPreventivemeasureOf, Prevents, isPreventedBy, Causes, isCausedBy.\nThe class Health monitoring and\ndisease control relates to the class Vaccination through thepropertyhasPreventivemeasureand the class Vaccination is related to the class Health monitoring and disease control through the property isPreventivemeasureOf These two properties are inverses of each other. The classes Vaccination and Bacterial relates through Prevents and isPreventedBy property. The classes Bacterial and fowl typhoid are related through Causes and isCausedBy property. The characteristics of these properties are Antisymmetricand irreflexive.\nThe properties can be edited using the\nproperties tab selecting either object properties or datatype properties.Annotations can also be added to the properties in order to describe about it. To create an object property switch to object properties tab, use the add object property button, this creates a new object property.\nTo set characteristics, the check box\nnearer to the property is checked. To specify properties to the classes domain and range are\nspecified. In this case, the domain of Causes is Bacterial and its range is Fowl typhoid and the inverse of this will be for isCausedBy."

      "heading" : "3. OPEN WORLD ASSUMPTION",
      "text" : "The assumption is made by description\nlogic, this denotes a lack of knowledge. The consequence is that if two classes Biosecurityand Vaccination are not defined as disjoint then it can havethe individuals incommon.Thedisjointness in classes plays a vital role in each of the class description. Creating a class and making it complement to another class is done here."

      "heading" : "3.1 Using Reasoner",
      "text" : "The consistencycan be checked through\nthe reasoner. Protégésupports manyreasoners.This\npaper uses Hermit as its reasoner. Reasoning means to infer new knowledge from the statements asserted by an ontology designer. The illegal mistakes committed by the developer are spotted out by the reasoner. The problem that is facedwhen thepoultryontologyis developed is, due to a wrong setting of property characteristics, the reasonerdisplays errormessages like inconsistentontologies.\nReasoning capabilities are exploited\nto detect logical inconsistencies within the ontology. The error has been occurred while setting characteristics, asymmetric and reflexive to\na same property. The consistency checks can help developer in an adequate manner while constructing the ontologies.\nThe important issue with reasoners is\nthat OWLis not able to handle full expressivity. The specification distinguishes between OWL Full and OWL DL to indicate tractable language elements to reasoners. Ontologies which use metaclasses which is a OWL Full element cannot be classified. The conversion of OWL Full to OWLDLcan be made using the classifier. Complete OWL Full syntax is not supported by protégé."

      "text" : "The structure of any expression in\nRDF consistsof triples, eachconsistingofasubject, a predicate and an object. A set of each triples is called an RDF graph. This can be illustrated using the node and arc diagram, in which each triple is represented as a node-arc-node link. In order to avoid conversion between different description languages, ontology needs a common language to express. XML has been used for this purpose since it has standards on data exchange. OWL ontology is most commonly serialized using RDF/XML\nsyntax. The RDF/XML schemas are\nrepresented in Figure 5."
