      "text" : "Probabilistic generative models underpin many successful applications within the field of natural language processing (NLP). Their popularity stems form their ability to use unlabelled data effectively, to incorporate abundant linguistic features, and to learn interpretable dependencies among data. However these successes are tempered by the fact that as the structure of such generative models becomes deeper and more complex, true Bayesian inference becomes intractable due to the high dimensional integrals required. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Neal, 1993; Andrieu et al., 2003) and variational inference (Jordan et al., 1999; Attias, 2000; Beal, 2003) are the standard approaches for approximating these integrals. However the computational cost of the former results in impractical training for the large and deep neural networks which are now fashionable, and the latter is conventionally confined due to the underestimation of posterior variance. The lack of effective and efficient inference methods hinders our ability to create highly expressive models of text, especially in the situation where the model is non-conjugate.\nThis paper introduces a neural variational framework for generative models of text, inspired by the variational auto-encoder (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013). The principle idea is to build an inference network, implemented by a deep neural network conditioned on text, to approximate the intractable distributions over the latent variables. Instead of providing an analytic approximation, as in traditional variational Bayes, neural variational inference learns to model the posterior probability, thus endowing the model with strong generalisation abilities. Due to the flexibility of deep neural networks, the inference network is capable of learning complicated non-linear distributions and processing structured inputs such as word sequences. Inference networks can be designed as, but not restricted to, multilayer perceptrons (MLP), convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks (RNN), approaches which are rarely used in conventional generative models. By using the reparameterisation method (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013), the inference network is trained through back-propagating unbiased and low variance gradients w.r.t. the latent variables. Within this framework, we propose a Neural Variational Document Model (NVDM) for document modelling and a Neural Answer Selection Model (NASM) for question answering, a task that selects the sentences that correctly answer a factoid question from a set of candidate sentences.\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 03\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 N\nov 2\n01 5\nThe NVDM (Figure 1) is an unsupervised generative model of text which aims to extract a continuous semantic latent variable for each document. This model can be interpreted as a variational auto-encoder: an MLP encoder (inference network) compresses the bag-of-words document representation into a continuous latent distribution, and a softmax decoder (generative model) reconstructs the document by generating the words independently. A primary feature of NVDM is that each word is generated directly from a dense continuous document representation instead of the more common binary semantic vector (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2009; Larochelle & Lauly, 2012; Srivastava et al., 2013; Mnih & Gregor, 2014). Our experiments demonstrate that our neural document model achieves state of the art perplexities on the 20 Newsgroups and Reuters datasets.\nThe NASM (Figure 2) is a supervised conditional model which imbues LSTMs (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) with a latent stochastic attention mechanism to model the semantics of question-answer pairs and predict their relatedness. The attention model is designed to focus on the phrases of an answer that are strongly connected to the question semantics and is modelled by a latent distribution. This mechanism allows the model to deal with the ambiguity inherent in the task and learns pair-specific representations that are more effective at predicting answer matches, rather than independent embeddings of question and answer sentences. Bayesian inference provides a natural safeguard against overfitting, especially as the training sets available for this task are small. The experiments show that the LSTM with a latent stochastic attention mechanism learns an effective attention model and outperforms both previously published results, and our own strong non-stochastic attention baselines.\nIn summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of neural variational inference for text processing on two diverse tasks. These models are simple, expressive and can be trained efficiently with the highly scalable stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013). Our neural variational framework is suitable for both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks, and can be generalised to incorporate any type of neural networks."

      "text" : "Latent variable modelling is popular in many NLP problems, but it is non-trivial to carry out effective and efficient inference for models with complex and deep structure. In this section we introduce a generic neural variational inference framework that we apply to both the unsupervised NVDM and supervised NASM in the follow sections.\nWe focus on the general scenario in which a latent variable h is introduced into a deep neural network. We designate the observed parent and child nodes of h as z and x respectively. We form the variational lower bound L to optimise the joint distribution:\nlog pθ(z,x) = log\n∫ q(h)\nq(h) pθ(x|h)pθ(h|z)p(z)dh (1)\n> Eq(h)[log pθ(x|h)pθ(h|z)p(z)− log q(h)] = L (2) where θ parameterises the generative distributions pθ(x|h) and pθ(h|z). To have a tight lower bound, the variational distribution q(h) should approach the true posterior p(h|z,x). The three steps to construct the deep neural inference network qφ(h|z,x), which is a parameterised diagonal Gaussian distribution N (h|µ(z,x),diag(σ2(z,x))), are:\n1. Construct vector representations of the observed variables: u = fz(z), v = fx(x).\n2. Assemble a joint representation: π = g(u,v).\n3. Parameterise the variational distribution over the latent variable: µ = l1(π), logσ = l2(π).\nf(·) can be any type of deep neural network that is suitable for the observed data; g(·) is an MLP that concatenates the vector representations of the conditioning variables; l(·) is a linear transformation which outputs the parameters of the Gaussian distribution. By sampling from the variational distribution, h ∼ qφ(h|z,x), we are able to carry out stochastic back-propagation to optimise the lowerbound (Eq.2).\nq (h∣X) (Inference Network)\nX\np(X∣h)\nh\nX\nFigure 1: NVDM for document modelling.\na\nq\ny\nz q\nc(a,h)\nz a\nh\np(h∣q) p( y∣zq , z a)\nα\nFigure 2: NASM for question answer selection.\nDuring training, the model parameters θ together with the inference network parameters φ are updated by stochastic back-propagation based on the samples h drawn from qφ(h|z,x). For the gradients w.r.t. θ, we have the form:\n∇θL ' 1L ∑L l=1∇θ log pθ(x|h (l))pθ(h (l)|z) (3)\nFor the gradients w.r.t. φ we reparameterise h = µ + σ · and sample (l) ∼ N (0, I) (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013). The update of φ can be carried out by back-propagating the gradients w.r.t. µ and σ:\n∇µL ' 1L ∑L l=1∇h[log pθ(x|h (l))pθ(h (l)|z)− log qφ(h(l)|z,x)] (4)\n∇σL ' 12L ∑L l=1 (l)∇h(l) [log pθ(x|h (l))pθ(h (l)|z)− log qφ(h(l)|z,x)] (5)\nIt is worth mentioning that unsupervised learning is a special case of the variational autoencoder where h has no parent node z. In that case h is directly drawn from the prior p(h) instead of the conditional distribution pθ(h|z). Here we only discuss the scenario where the latent variables are continuous and the parameterised diagonal Gaussian distribution is employed as the variational distribution. However the framework is also suitable for discrete units, and the only modification needed is to replace the Gaussian with a multinomial parameterised by the outputs of a softmax function. Though the reparameterisation trick for continuous variables is not applicable in this case, a policy gradient approach (Mnih & Gregor, 2014) can help to alleviate the problem of high variance during stochastic estimation."

      "text" : "The Neural Variational Document Model (Figure 1) is a simple instance of unsupervised learning where a continuous hidden variable h ∈ RK , which generates all the words in a document independently, is introduced to represent its semantic content. Let X ∈ R|V | be the bag-of-words representation of a document and xi ∈ R|V | be the one-hot representation of the word at position i. As an unsupervised generative model, we could interpret NVDM as a variational autoencoder: an MLP encoder p(h|X) compresses document representations into continuous hidden vectors (X → h); a softmax decoder p(X|h) = ∏ i p(xi|h) reconstructs the documents by independently generating the words (h→ {xi}). To maximise the document log-likelihood log ∑ h p(X|h)p(h), we derive the lowerbound:\nL = Eqφ(h|X) [∑N i=1 log pθ(xi|h) ] −DKL[qφ(h|X)‖p(h)] (6)\nwhereN is the number of words in the document and p(h) is a Gaussian prior for h. The conditional probability over words pθ(xi|h) (decoder) is modelled by multinomial logistic regression and shared across documents:\npθ(xi|h) = exp{−E(xi;h, θ))}∑|V | j=1 exp{−E(xj ;h, θ)}\n(7)\nE(xi;h, θ) = −hTRxi − bxi (8)\nwhereR ∈ RK×|V | learns the semantic word embeddings and bxi represents the bias term. As there is no supervision information for the latent semantics, h, the posterior approximation qφ(h|X) is only conditioned on the current document X . The inference network qφ(h|X) = N (h|µ(X), diag(σ2(X))) is modelled as:\nπ = g(fMLPX (X)) (9) µ = l1(π), logσ = l2(π) (10)\nFor each document X , the neural network generates its own parameters µ and σ that parameterise the latent distribution over document semantics h. Based on the samples h ∼ qφ(h|X), the lower bound (Eq. 6) can be optimised by stochastic back-propagation.\nSince p(h) is a standard Gaussian prior, DKL[qφ(h|X)‖p(h)] is a Gaussian KL-Divergence which can be computed analytically to further lower the variance of the gradients. Following the neural variational framework, the parameters of inference network φ and the model parameters θ are updated by SGVB. Appendix B.1 provides the formal details of the neural network structure."

      "heading" : "4 NEURAL ANSWER SELECTION MODEL",
      "text" : "Answer sentence selection is a question answering paradigm where a model must identify the correct sentences answering a factual question from a set of candidate sentences. Assume a question q is associated with a set of answer sentences {a1,a2, ...,an}, together with their judgements {y1,y2, ...,yn}, where ym = 1 if the answer am is correct and ym = 0 otherwise. This is a classification task where we treat each training data point as a triple (q,a,y) while predicting y for the unlabelled question-answer pair (q,a).\nThe Neural Answer Selection Model (Figure 2) is a supervised model that learns the question and answer representations and predicts their relatedness. It employs two LSTMs to embed raw question inputs q and answer inputs a. We use sq(j) and sa(i) to represent the outputs of the two LSTMs. Conventionally, the last state outputs sq(|q|) and sa(|a|), as the independent question and answer representations, can be used for relatedness prediction. In NASM, however, we aim to learn pair-specific representations by a latent attention mechanism, which are more effective for the pair relatedness prediction.\nThe aim of the attention model is to focus on the words in the answer sentence that are prominent for predicting the answer match to the current question. Instead of using a deterministic question vector, such as sq(|q|), NASM employs a latent distribution pθ(h|q) to model the question semantics, which is a parameterised diagonal Gaussian N (h|µ(q),diag(σ2(q))). It extracts a context vector c(a,h) by iteratively attending to the answer tokens based on the stochastic vector h ∼ pθ(h|q). In doing so the model is able to adapt to the ambiguity inherent in questions and obtain salient information through attention. Compared to its deterministic counterpart, the stochastic units incorporated into NASM allow multi-modality attention distributions. Further, by marginalising over the latent variables, NASM is more robust to overfitting, which is important for small question answering training sets.\nIn this model, the conditional distribution pθ(h|q) is modelled as:\nπθ = gθ(f LSTM q (q)) = gθ(sq(|q|)) (11)\nµθ = l1(πθ), logσθ = l2(πθ) (12)\nFor each question q, the neural network generates its own parameters µ and σ that parameterise the latent distribution over question semantics h. The attention model is defined as:\nα(i) ∝ exp(W Tα tanh(W hh+W ssa(i))) (13) c(a,h) = ∑ i sa(i)α(i) (14) za(a,h) = tanh (W ac(a,h) +W nsa(|a|)) (15)\nwhere α(i) is the normalised attention score at answer token i, and the context vector c(a,h) is the weighted sum of all the state outputs sa(i). We adopt zq(q), za(a,h) as the question and answer representations for predicting their relatedness y. zq(q) is a deterministic vector that is equal to\nsq(|q|), while za(a,h) is a combination of the sequence output sa(|a|) and the context vector c(a,h) (Eq.15). For the prediction of pair relatedness y, we model the conditional probability distribution pθ(y|zq, za) by sigmoid function:\npθ(y = 1|zq, za) = σ ( zTq Mza + b ) (16)\nTo maximise the log-likelihood log p(y|q,a) we use the variational lower bound: log p(y|q,a) = log ∑\nh pθ(y|zq(q), za(a,h))pθ(h|q) (17)\n> Eqφ(h)[log pθ(y|zq(q), za(a,h))]−DKL(qφ(h)||pθ(h|q)) = L (18) Following the neural variational inference framework, we construct a deep neural network as the inference network qφ(h|q,a,y) = N (h|µφ(q,a,y),diag(σ2φ(q,a,y))):\nπφ = gφ(f LSTM q (q), f LSTM a (a), fy(y)) = gφ(sq(|q|), sa(|a|), sy) (19)\nµφ = l3(πφ), logσφ = l4(πφ) (20)\nwhere q and a are modelled by LSTMs1, and the relatedness label y is modelled by a simple linear transformation into the vector sy . According to the joint representation πφ, we then generate the parameters µφ and σφ, which parameterise the latent distribution over the question semantics h. To emphasise, though both pθ(h|q) and qφ(h|q,a,y) are modelled as parameterised Gaussian distributions, qφ(h|q,a,y) as an approximation only functions during inference to compute the stochastic gradients, while pθ(h|q) as the generative distribution is used in prediction for the question-answer relatedness y.\nBased on the samples h ∼ qφ(h|q,a,y), we use SGVB to optimise the lowerbound (Eq.18). The model parameters θ and the inference network parameters φ are updated jointly using their stochastic gradients. In this case, similar to the NVDM, the Gaussian KL divergence DKL[qφ(h|q,a,y))‖pθ(h|q)] can be analytically computed during training process. More details about the network structure can be found in Appendix B.2."

QASent (Wang et al., 2007) was created from the TREC QA track, and the WikiQA (Yang et al., 2015) is constructed from Wikipedia. Due to the different approaches for constructing the datasets4, the WikiQA dataset is less noisy and less biased towards lexical overlap. Table 3 summarises the statistics of the two datasets.\nIn order to investigate the effectiveness of our NASM model we also implemented two strong baseline models — a vanilla LSTM model (LSTM) and an LSTM model with a deterministic attention mechanism (LSTM+Att). For the former, the last state outputs from the question and answer LSTM models are passed directly to the QA matching function (Eq.16). For the latter, we add an attention model that uses the last state output of the question LSTM as the question semantics to extract the context vector (Eq.14). LSTM+Att is the deterministic counterpart of NASM. Following previous work, for each of our models we also add a lexical overlap feature by combining a co-occurrence word count feature with the probability generated from the neural model. We adopt MAP and MRR as the evaluation metrics for this task.\nTo facilitate direct comparison with previous work we follow the same experimental setup as Yu et al. (2014) and Severyn (2015).

For most of the sentences that are not answering the question, neither of the two attention models can attend to reasonable words that are beneficial for predicting relatedness. But for the correct answer sentences, such as the ones in Figure 4, both attentive models are able to capture crucial information by attending to different parts of the sentence based on the question semantics. Interestingly, compared to the deterministic counterpart, our NASM assigns higher attention scores on the prominent words that are relevant to the question, which forms a more peaked distribution and in turn helps the model achieve better performance."

      "text" : "Training an inference network to approximate the variational distribution was first proposed in the context of Helmholtz machines (Hinton & Zemel, 1994; Hinton et al., 1995; Dayan & Hinton, 1996), but applications of these directed generative models come up against the problem of establishing low variance gradient estimators. Recent advances in neural variational inference (Rezende et al., 2014; Kingma & Welling, 2013; Mnih & Gregor, 2014) mitigate this problem by reparameterising the continuous random variables via differentiable transformation or using control variates. Instantiations of this idea, the Deep Recurrent Attentive Writer (DRAW) (Gregor et al., 2015) and the semi-supervised generative learning framework (Kingma et al., 2014), have demonstrated strong performance on image generation and classification respectively.\nAnother class of neural generative models make use of the autoregressive assumption to model highdimensional input distributions (Larochelle & Murray, 2011; Uria et al., 2014; Germain et al., 2015). Deep AutoRegressive Networks (DARN) (Gregor et al., 2013) integrate this idea with variational inference. Applications of these models on document modelling achieve significant improvements on generating documents, compared to conventional probabilistic topic models (Hofmann, 1999; Blei et al., 2003; Teh et al., 2006) and also the RBMs (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2009; Srivastava et al., 2013). Compared to these models that use binary semantic vectors, our NVDM employs dense continuous document representations which are both expressive and easy to train. The semantic word vector model (Maas et al., 2011) also employs a continuous semantic vector to generate words, but the model is trained by MAP inference which does not permit the calculation of the posterior distribution.\nPrior work on question answering relies on classifiers with large numbers of hand-crafted syntactic and semantic features and various external resources. Only very recently have researchers started to apply deep learning to question answering. Relevant work includes mapping factoid questions with answer triples in the knowledge base by projecting them into a shared vector space using convolutional neural networks (Bordes et al., 2014b;a; Yih et al., 2014). Recently, the attentionbased learning models (Bahdanau et al., 2014) are applied to QA, where long-term memories act as dynamic knowledge bases (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015) or the attentive network helps read and comprehend (Hermann et al., 2015).\nOur NASM effectively combines the strengths of LSTMs with attention mechanism and stochastic units, which equips our model with stronger capability to infer the correctness of an answer to a given question. Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks (SFNN) (Tang & Salakhutdinov, 2013) applied similar idea of combining hybrid deterministic and stochastic units on expression classification. However, the inference is carried out by Monte Carlo EM algorithm with the reliance on importance sampling, which is less efficient and lack of scalability."

In this paper we introduce a generic variational inference framework for generative and conditional models of text. While traditional variational methods derive an analytic approximation for the intractable distributions over latent variables, here we construct an inference network conditioned on the discrete text input to provide the variational distribution. We validate this framework on two very different text modelling applications, generative document modelling and supervised question answering. Our neural variational document model combines a continuous stochastic document representation with a bag-of-words generative model and achieves the lowest reported perplexities on two standard test corpora. The neural answer selection model employs a stochastic representation layer within an attention mechanism to extract the semantics between a question and answer pair. On two question answering benchmarks this model exceeds all previous published benchmarks.",
