      "text" : "It is clear that there has been an unexpected increase in the quantity and variety of data generated worldwide by computers, mobile phones, and sensors. Just as computer technology evolved, the quantity and variety of data has also increased, becoming more focused on storing every type of data, the socalled Big Data. As the volume of data to build a predictive model increases,\nFerhat Özgür Çatak TÜBİTAK BİLGEM, Cyber Security Institute Kocaeli, Turkey Tel.: +90-262-6481000 Fax: +90-262-6481100 E-mail: ozgur.catak@tubitak.gov.tr\nthe complexity of that training increases too. As a result, building actionable predictive modeling of a large scale unstructured data set is a definitive Big Data problem. Predictive learning models try to discover patterns of training data and label new data instances to the correct output value. To efficiently handle unstructured large scale big data sets, it is critical to develop new machine learning methods that combine several boosting and classification algorithms.\nExtreme Learning Machine (ELM) was proposed by [1] based on generalized Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFNs). Main characteristics of ELM are small training time compared to traditional gradient-based learning methods, high generalization property of predicting unseen examples with multi-class labels and parameter free with randomly generated hidden nodes. ELM algorithm is used in many different areas including document classification [2], bioinformatics [3] multimedia recognition [4,5].\nIn recent years, much computational intelligence research has been devoted to building predictive modeling of distributed and parallel frameworks. In this research, the proposed learning model creates data chunks with varying size and bag of classifier functions using ELM algorithm trained with these arbitrary chosen sub data set with AdaBoosting method for large scale predictions. By creating data chunks from the training data set using the MapReduce paradigm, each subset of the training data set is used to find out the set of ELM ensembles as a single global classifier function.\nThe main objective of this work is to train large scale data sets using ELM and AdaBoost. Another objective is to achieve the model’s classification performance with same or close to the conventional ELM method. Conventional ELM training cannot be applied to large scale data sets on a single computer because of their complexity. Then experiments section is split into two subsections: ”commonly used data sets” in Section 5.1.1 and ”large scale data sets” in Section 5.1.2. Commonly used data sets are suitable for training on a single computer with the conventional ELM algorithm. We trained these data sets both conventional and proposed methods to show the classification performance changes of the proposed method. Classification performance results are shown in Section 5.3.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n– A generative MapReduce technique based AdaBoosted ELM classification model is proposed for learning, and thus, faster classification model training is achieved. – This research proposes a new learning method for AdaBoosted ELM that achieves parallelization both in large scale data sets and reduced computational time of learning algorithm. – Training computations of working nodes are independent from each other thus minimizing the data communication. The other approaches, including Support Vector Machine training need data communication for the support vector exchange. [6,7,8].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces some of the earlier works related to our problem. Section 3 describes algorithm ELM, AdaBoost and MapReduce technique. Section 4 and Section 5 evaluates the proposed learning model. Section 6 concludes this paper."

Many different MapReduce based learning solutions over arbitrary partitioned data have been proposed recently. Some popular MapReduce based solutions to train machine learning algorithms in the literature include the following. Panda et al. proposed a learning tree model which is based on series of distributed computations, and implements each one using the MapReduce model of distributed computation [9]. Zhang et al. develops some algorithms using MapReduce to perform parallel data joins on large scale data sets [10]. Sun et al. use batch updating based hierarchical clustering to reduce computational time and data communication [11]. Their approach uses co-occurence based feature selection to remove noisy features and decrease the dimension of the feature vectors. He et al. proposed parallel density based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN). They developed a partitioning strategy for large scale non-indexed data with a 4-stages MapReduce paradigm [12]. Zhao et al. proposed parallel k-means clustering based on MapReduce [13].

      "text" : "Chen et al. have been proposed MapReduce based ELM ensemble classifier called ELM-MapReduce, for large scale land cover classification of remote sensing data [19]. Their approach contains two sequential phases: parallel training\nof multiple ELM classifiers and voting mechanism. In parallel training phase of proposed method, each Map function computes an ELM classifier with a given training data set. In second phase called voting mechanism, a new MapReduce job is executed with a new partitioned test set into each Map function with notation dataj . In Reduce function of this phase, each dataj is predicted with each ELM classifier trained in parallel training phase. Final classification predictions are the output of final Reduce function. Therefore, this approach has a high communication cost. Their experimental results are based synthetic remote sensing image of training data.\n2.3 The Differences Between Proposed Model and Literature Review\nThe main differences are:\n– In ELM⋆, they use matrix multiplication decomposition. Each Map function is responsible to calculate the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse operation. And their method produces one single classifier. In the proposed model in our paper, each Reduce function produces ensemble classifier based on AdaBoost method. The final output ensemble classifier is a voting based combination of ensemble classifier trained in each Reduce phase. – In OS-ELM based classification in hierarchical P2P Network, POS-ELM and DK-ELM, they propose ensemble classifier that combines multiple classifier trained with data chunks. Each peer classifier is learned from the local data. Therefore, each peer produces a single ELM classifier. In our method, each node (or peer) produces ensemble classifier to increase the classification accuracy. – In ELM-MapReduce, they propose ensemble classifier with two different MapReduce jobs. In first MpaReduce job, their approach produces a single ELM classifier in eachMap function. In second MapReduce job, the test set is partitioned into each Map function and produces final predicted labels based on the voting mechanism of ELM classifiers that are trained in the first MapReduce job. In our method, prediction is not included, our aim is to create a final ensemble classifier in only one MapReduce job.\nTable 1 shows the main differences of all proposed methods. There are five different columns that are ensemble methods, single pass MapReduce, matrix multiplication, entire data set and network communication. Ensemble column shows that the method builds a set of classifier function (i.e. ensemble model) to improve the accuracy performance of the final classification model. If an ensemble method is applied, then the performance of final model will have better accuracy result [20]. Single Pass MapReduce column shows that an iterative approach is not applied to the model. Entire learning phase is performed in a single pass of data through the job. Matrix Multiplication column shows the hidden layer matrix is calculated in each Map function. The hidden layer matrix computation is a compute intensive operation. Entire Data Set column shows each Map operation needs entire data set to build a final classifier model. Network Communication column shows that each MapReduce job\nneeds to communicate with another job. Network communication will affect negatively on training time of the algorithm."

      "heading" : "3 Preliminaries",
      "text" : "In this section, we introduce preliminary knowledge of ELM, AdaBoost and MapReduce briefly.\n3.1 Extreme learning machine\nELM was originally proposed for the single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks [21,22,1] . Then, ELM was extended to the generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks where the hidden layer may not be neuron like [23, 24]. The main advantages of the ELM classification algorithm are that ELM can be trained hundred times faster than traditional neural network or support vector machine algorithm since its input weights and hidden node biases are randomly created and output layer weights can be analytically calculated by using a least-squares method [25,26]. The most noticeable feature of ELM is that its hidden layer parameters are selected randomly.\nGiven a set of training data D = {(xi, yi) | i = 1, ..., n},xi ∈ R p, yi ∈ {1, 2, ...,K}} sampled independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some unknown distribution. The goal of a neural network is to learn a function f : X → Y where X is instance and Y is the set of all possible labels. The output label of an single hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) with N hidden nodes can be described as\nfN (x) =\nN ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x), x ∈ R n, ai ∈ R n (1)\nwhere ai and bi are the learning parameters of hidden nodes and βi is the weight connecting the ith hidden node to the output node.\nThe output function of ELM for generalized SLFNs can be identified by\nfN (x) =\nN ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x) = β × h(x) (2)\nFor the binary classification applications, the decision function of ELM becomes\nfN(x) = sign\n(\nN ∑\ni=1\nβiG(ai, bi,x)\n)\n= sign (β × h(x)) (3)\nEquation 2 can be written in another form as\nHβ = T (4)\nH and T are respectively hidden layer matrix and output matrix. Hidden layer matrix can be described as\nH(ã, b̃, x̃) =\n\n  G(a1, b1, x1) · · · G(aL, bL, x1) ... . . . ...\nG(a1, b1, xN ) · · · G(aL, bL, xN )\n\n \nN×L\n(5)\nwhere ã = a1, ..., aL, b̃ = b1, ..., bL, x̃ = x1, ..., xN . Output matrix can be described as\nT = [ t1 . . . tN ]T\n(6)\nThe hidden nodes of SLFNs can be randomly generated. They can be independent of the training data.\n3.2 AdaBoost\nThe AdaBoost [27] is a supervised learning algorithm designed to solve classification problems [28]. The algorithm takes as input a training set (x1, y1), ..., (xn, yn) where the input sample xi ∈ R\np, and the output value, yi, in a finite space y ∈ 1, ...K. AdaBoost algorithm assumes, like ELM, a set of training data sampled independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some unknown distribution X .\nGiven a space of feature vectors X and two possible class labels, y ∈ {−1,+1}, AdaBoost goal is to learn a strong classifier H(x) as a weighted ensemble of weak classifiers ht(x) predicting the label of any instance x ∈ X [29].\nH(x) = sign(f(x)) = sign\n(\nT ∑\nt=1\nαtht(x)\n)\n(7)\nPseudocode for AdaBoost is given in Alg. 1.\nAlgorithm 1 The AdaBoost algorithm.\n1: Inputs:\nD = {{(xi, yi) | i = 1, ..., n},xi ∈ R p, yi ∈ {−1,+1}} m i=1\n2: Initialize D(i) = 1 m\nfor all i 3: while t < T do 4: Train WeakLearner using distribution Dt 5: get back a weak hypothesis ht : X → {1, 2, ...,K} 6: calculate the error of ht : ǫt = Pri∼Dt [ht(xi) 6= yi] 7: Sets αt = 1 2 ln 1−ǫt ǫt\n8: update distribution Dt+1 = Dt Zt ×\n{\ne−αt , if ht = yi eαt , if ht 6= yi\n9: equivalently Dt+1 = Dt×exp(−αtyiht(xi))\nZt where Zt is a normalization\nconstant. 10: end while 11: Outputs:\nfinal hypothesis h∗ = sign ( ∑T t=1 αtht(x) )\n.\n3.3 MapReduce\nMapReduce is a new programming model to run parallel applications for large scale data sets processing to support data-intensive applications. It is derived from the map and reduce function combination from functional programming. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. The MapReduce was originally developed by Google and built on principles in parallel manner [30]. The MapReduce framework first takes the input, divides it into smaller data chunks, and distributes them to worker nodes. MapReduce is divided into three major phases called map, reduce and a separated internal shuffle phase. The MapReduce framework automatically executes all those functions in a parallel manner over any number of processors/servers [31].\nPseudo code of MapReduce framework is shown in Eq. 8.\nmap(key1, value1) → list(key2, value2)\nreduce(key2, list(value2)) → list(key3, value3) (8)\nMapreduce programming technique is widely used on different scientific fields, i.e. cyber-security [32,33], high energy physics [34], biology [35]."

AdaBoosted ELM’s basic idea is to calculate ensemble of classifier functions over partitioned data (Xm, Ym) in parallel manner. In Table 2, a summary of commonly used variables and notations to assess the classifier model performance of the AdaBoosted ELM method is given for convenience.\n4.2 Analysis of the proposed algorithm\nBarlett showed that the size of the weights is more important than the size of the neural network [36]. Kragh et al. also showed that ensemble methods of neural networks get better accuracy performance over unseen examples [37]. The main motivation of the this work is the idea that small size ELM ensembles can obtain more accurate classifier model that are comparable to individual classifiers.\nIn the proposed model, at every data chunk, there is a set of classifier functions that acts as a single classification model. The single model at every data chunk m is defined as follows:\nf (m)(x) = argmax k\nT ∑\nt=1\nαtht(x) (9)\nThe selected ensemble ELM classifier models from the reduce phase of MapReduce algorithm are combined into one single classification model.\nĥ(x) = argmax k\nm ∑\ni=1\nf (m)(x) (10)\n4.3 Implementation of the Model\nThe pseudocodes of MapReduce-based AdaBoost ELM are shown in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3.

Reduce procedure is implemented based on the for-loop of lines 3 - 8 of Algorithm 3. The output ELM classifier of sub data set (Xk,yk) is calculated using AdaBoost constantly block by block, so every reduce task completes training phase and outputs an AdaBoosted set of classifier functions. The mapper’s input k is the randomSplitId to create the data chunk and created in the Map phase of our training model.\nAlgorithm 3 AdaBoostedELM::Reduce\n1: Inputs: Key k, Value Set V ,AdaBoost Iteration Size T 2: Split V into input space Xn and out labels yn with (Xn,yn) ← V 3: for t = 1..T do 4: Train sub data set with ELM: ht ← ELM(X, y) 5: ypred, ǫt ← ht(X) 6: αt ← 1 2 ln 1−ǫt ǫt 7: Dt+1 = Dt×exp(−αtyiht(xi)) Zt 8: end for 9: Outputs:\nFinal hypothesis for the reduce function m : hm ← argmaxk ∑T t=1 αtht(x) ."

    "abstractText" : "Machine learning based computational intelligence methods are widely used to analyze large scale data sets in this age of big data. Extracting useful predictive modeling from these types of data sets is a challenging problem due to their high complexity. Analyzing large amount of streaming data that can be leveraged to derive business value is another complex problem to solve. With high levels of data availability (i.e. Big Data) automatic classification of them has become an important and complex task. Hence, we explore the power of applying MapReduce based Distributed AdaBoosting of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to build a predictive bag of classification models. Accordingly, (i) data set ensembles are created; (ii) ELM algorithm is used to build weak learners (classifier functions); and (iii) builds a strong learner from a set of weak learners. We applied this training model to the benchmark knowledge discovery and data mining data sets.",
