{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "The Variational Walkback Algorithm", "abstract": "A recognized obstacle to training undirected graphical models with latent variables such as Boltzmann machines is that the maximum likelihood training procedure requires sampling from Monte-Carlo Markov chains which may not mix well, in the inner loop of training, for each example.  We first propose the idea that it is sufficient to locally carve the energy function everywhere so that its gradient points in the \"right\" direction (i.e., towards generating the data). Following on previous work on contrastive divergence, denoising autoencoders, generative stochastic networks and unsupervised learning using non-equilibrium dynamics, we propose a variational bound on the marginal log-likelihood of the data which corresponds to a new learning procedure that first walks away from data points by following the model transition operator and then trains that operator to walk backwards for each of these steps, back towards the training example. The tightness of the variational bound relies on gradually increasing temperature as we walk away from the data, at each step providing a gradient on the parameters to maximize the probability that the transition operator returns to its previous state. Interestingly, this algorithm admits a variant where there is no explicit energy function, i.e., the parameters are used to directly define the transition operator. This also eliminates the explicit need for symmetric weights which previous Boltzmann machine or Hopfield net models require, and which makes these models less biologically plausible.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper proposes a new kind of generative model based on an annealing process, where the transition probabilities are learned directly to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood.

Training involves sampling and then learning a transition-based inference to \"walk back\" samples to the data. Because of its focus on transitions, it can be used to learn a raw transition operator rather than purely learning an energy-based model. The objective is intuitively appealing because of its similarity to previous successful but less principled training methods for MRFs like Contrastive Divergence.\n\nThe idea for the algorithm is appealing, and it looks like it could find a nice place in the literature. However, the submission in its current form is not yet ready for publication. Experiments are qualitative and the generated samples are not obviously indicative of a high model quality. As pointed out elsewhere, the mathematical analysis does not currently demonstrate tightness of the variational bound in the case of a learned transition operator. More evaluation using e.g. annealed importance sampling to estimate held-out likelihoods is necessary. Assuming that the analysis can be repaired, the ability to directly parametrize a transition operator, an interesting strength of this method, should be explored in further experiments and contrasted with the more standard energy-based modeling.\n\nThis looks like a promising idea, and other reviews and questions have already raised some important technical points which should help strengthen this paper for future submission.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Like the underlying idea, not convinced by its current incarnation", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "I very much like the underlying idea for this paper. I wasn't convinced by the execution in its current state. My primary concern is the one I expressed in my pre-review question below, which I don't think the authors addressed. Specifically, I think the choice of q(s | s') = p(s | s') will make the forward and reverse trajectories almost pathologically mismatched to each other, and will thus make the variational bound extremely loose and high variance. \n\nThe claim about the tightness of the bound in Appendix D relies on the assumption that the transition distribution obeys detailed balance. The learned transition distribution in the paper does not obey detailed balance, and therefore the tightness claim in Appendix D does not hold. (In Section 2.1 you briefly discuss the idea of learning an energy function, rather than directly learning a transition distribution. I think this would be excellent, and in that case you could choose an MCMC transition operator that does obey detailed balance for that energy function.) I did not go through Appendix D beyond this step.\n\nThe experimental results were not visually impressive. I suspect this is primarily driven by the mismatch between generative and inference trajectories. See my concern above and in the pre-review question below.\n\nAlso, see note below for sec. 5. I suspect some terms are being dropped from the training gradient.\n\nThe paper is optimizing a variational bound on log likelihood.

It's never specified.\nsec. 5, last paragraph in GSN section -- Note that q also depends on theta, so by not backpropagating through the full q chain you are dropping terms from the gradient.\nsec. 5, non-equilibrium thermodynamics -- Note that the noneq. paper also increases the noise variance as the distance from the data increases.\nFig. 1 -- right/left mislabeled\nFig. 2 -- label panes\nFig. 3 -- After how many walkback steps?", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "clever idea, but needs more quantitative validation and discussion of (closely) related work", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a new kind of generative model based on an annealing process, where the transition probabilities are learned directly to maximize a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood.
