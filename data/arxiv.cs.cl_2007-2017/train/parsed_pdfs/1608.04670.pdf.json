      "text" : "Before beginning the discussion of the problem we will first define some terms that will be used in the remainder of the paper. A product is any commodity which may be sold by a retailer. An attribute is a feature that describes a specific property of a product or a product listing. Some examples of attributes include brand, color, gender, material, title, description, etc. An attribute value is a particular value assumed by the attribute. For example, for the product title\nApple iPad Mini 3 16GB Wi-Fi Refurbished, Gold\nthe brand attribute value is ‘Apple’ and the color attribute value is ‘Gold’. A product may alternatively be defined as a collection of such attribute-value pairs, where a value can potentially be empty. Formally, let p be a product with attributes α1, α2, ..., αm and values v1, v2, ..., vm respectively. Then, we represent p = {α1 : v1, α2 : v2, ..., αm : vm} and write p(αi) = vi for 1 ≤ i ≤ m to indicate an attribute-value relationship for p.\nIn the context of an eCommerce website, the attribute values may be used to filter search results based on the items with a matching attribute value. As is done on Walmart.com and several other retail websites, this may be accomplished by populating relevant attribute values in the left hand navigation pane. For any given search or browse session, the\nCopyright is held by the author/owner(s) Workshop on Enterprise Intelligence, Aug 14, KDD 2016\nattributes that are displayed for further filtering in the left hand navigation as described above will be called facets.\nFor the sake of brevity, we use the terms ‘attribute value extraction’ and ‘attribute extraction’ synonymously."

      "text" : "We formalize attribute extraction as per the following definition.\nDefinition 1. Let x be a product title and let (x1, x2, .., xn) be a particular tokenization xt of x. Given an attribute α, attribute extraction is the process of discovering two functions E (raw extraction) and N (normalization) such that\n• E(xt) = E((x1, x2, ..., xn)) = (xi, xi+1, ..., xk) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k ≤ n where av = (xi, xi+1, ..., xk) is a tokenization of a particular value of α, • N((xi, xi+1, ..., xk)) = as where as is the standardized representation of av.\nExample 1. Consider the product title\nx = Hewlett Packard B4L03A#B1H Officejet Pro Eaio\nso that whitespace tokenization yields\nxt = (x1, x2, ..., x6) = (Hewlett, Packard, ..., Eaio).\nLet α be the attribute ‘brand’. Then we seek to find two functions E and N such that\nE((x1, x2, ..., x6)) = (x1, x2) = (Hewlett, Packard)\nand\nN((Hewlett, Packard)) = HP.\nThe goal of the attribute extraction system is to minimize the loss function 1− F1 where the F1 measure is as defined in section 9.1.\nAttribute value extraction is a particular instance of a named entity recognition problem. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques, in particular, sequence labeling algorithms for the purposes of extracting attribute values from product titles. We will also illustrate a normalization scheme which provides the dual benefits of standardizing variations in the same attribute value and boosting precision.\nIn section 3, we outline some of the challenges associated with attribute extraction in general. We reference some of the previous work on the problem of entity extraction in section 4. Section 5 describes the sequence labeling algorithms used to build an attribute extraction system that works well\nwith eCommerce data. This system is described in detail in sections 6 - 9 with respect to a particular attribute - ‘brand’. We finish the paper by describing how similar approaches have been successful in extracting other attributes such as ’character’, ‘manufacturer part number’, ‘package quantity’, etc and discussing the importance of attribute extraction in eCommerce."

      "text" : "Using facets to filter search or browse results is a common way for consumers of eCommerce websites to navigate the site and search through the product space. In order to ensure a good faceted navigation experience, it is critical to associate attribute value metadata to products for the attributes that appear in the facets.\nFor example, let S be a search query entered by a user and R be the set of products returned as a result. Suppose product p ∈ R and p has an attribute α which also happens to be a facet. Suppose further that the value of α applicable to p is v. When the user clicks on facet value v, the filtered result set is R ′ ⊆ R. Then p ∈ R ′\nif and only if p(α) = v. More concretely, suppose a user enters the search query ‘Tee shirt’ and the result set contains the product titled\nHanes Mens NANO-T Dri T-Shirt S Deep Red\nHowever, if the attribute ‘color’ for the product is missing the value ‘Red’, then if the user clicks on the value ‘Red’ under facet ‘color’, this product will no longer show in the result set even though it has the attribute value of interest to the user.\nThus, absence of relevant attribute values in product metadata has a direct bearing on the discoverability of the product and ultimately funnels down to affect the sale of such products.\nIt is crucial for modern eCommerce sites to be able to add products to its catalog as quickly as possible. As such, in order to ensure that the item set up process has minimal requirements, providing attribute values may not be enforced for all attributes. Consequently, a large fraction of incoming product data may not have attribute values supplied. In the absence of a system to tag missing attribute values, the discoverability of such products will be diminished."

      "text" : "We will describe a sequence labeling based machine learning system for extracting values of certain product attributes from product titles. We will discuss the challenges associated with this task and how they were handled in the current solution. In the next few sections we will describe the attribute extraction system using the specific example of brand extraction.\nIn certain product categories, brand is an important attribute. Extracting brands from product titles presents several interesting challenges, some of which are outlined below. Whenever possible, we include examples of actual titles of products sold on Walmart.com. In later sections we discuss how our solution mitigates these issues.\n• Unlike English prose, product titles do not adhere to a syntactic structure. They may be a concatenation of several nouns and adjectives as well as product specific identifiers and acronyms. Verbs tend to be missing and there is no standardized way of handling letter case. For example, consider the following titles of actual Walmart products (the brand names are in bold).\n– Chihuahua Bella Decorative Pillow by Manual Woodworkers and Weavers - SLCBCH\n– Real Deal Memorabilia BCosbyAlbumMF Bill Cos • Due to the diversity of products sold in any leading\neCommerce site, product titles do not follow any specific composition. For instance, the location of brands within titles may vary. Additionally, the number of tokens that constitute a brand name is also highly variable.\n– Old World Prints OWP86575Z Romantic Jasmine Poster Print by Vision studio - 18 x 22 – Autograph Warehouse 84377 Jake Rodriguez Card Boxing 1996 Ringside No . 40\n– Straight Talk Samsung Galaxy S3 Prepaid Cell Phone, White • Further, different products may contain slightly vary-\ning spellings of the same brand. This may include presence or absence of spaces and hyphens, presence or absence of apostrophe, presence or absence of trailing words such as ‘inc.’ or ‘ltd.’, etc.\n– J&C Baseball Clubhouse JC000213 WWE John Cena Engraved Collector Plaque with 8x10 KNOCK OUT Photo – J & C Baseball Clubhouse JC000008 Pittsburgh Penguins All Time Greats 6 Card Collector Plaque • Some titles may contain abbreviations of brand names. – Kcl 2SL25WH Accessory LED Tape Power Supply Lead in White – Kichler Builder 5019NI 8 Light Bath Strip in Brushed Nickel • Brand names in titles may contain typographical errors.\n– Trademak Global AD-CLC4000-PITT Pittsburgh Panthers 40 inch Rectangular Stained Glass Billiard Light\n– Trademark Global 24”Cushioned Folding Stool • A case of particular interest is that of generic or un-\nbranded products. There is especially a preponderance of such products that fall under jewelry and clothing categories.\n– 0.5Ctw Diamond Fashion Womens Fixed Ring Size - 7 – Women’s Popcorn Stitch Infinity Scarf\n• There are categories of products for which brand name is not an important attribute. In such cases, the brand facet will not even be displayed for a search of items belonging to these categories. Examples of such categories include books, movie DVDs, posters, etc. • The list of brand names relevant to a given product catalog is constantly changing. Products with new\nbrand names may appear, while some old brands may no longer sell any products. Thus, it is desirable for the brand extraction algorithm to be able to discover new brand names as well as extract known brands with high precision. • Collecting expert feedback either for the purposes of generating training data or validating model generated labels is subject to inter-annotator disagreement. It is not ideal to show different facet values that correspond to the same brand as it diminishes the quality of user experience. This is one of the reasons that makes crowd sourcing an unsatisfactory solution to the problem of attribute extraction."

      "heading" : "3.2 Comparison with other approaches",
      "text" : "3.2.1 Dictionary based lookup A simple method for attribute extraction is to prepare a\ncurated lexicon of attribute values and given a product title, scan it to find a value from the list. Some gazetteer based approaches are discussed in [16] in the context of named entity recognition problems. This approach suffers from numerous drawbacks. The curated list will need to be constantly updated in order to match to new attribute values in products. For certain attributes, the number of possible values can be of the order of the number of products themselves, e.g. ‘manufacturer part number’. For such attributes, lookup based approaches are completely ineffective. Further, as mentioned earlier, the same attribute value may occur in a variety of different forms in the title, so the curated list will need to discover and keep track of all variations. Finally, such a system will need to devise a mechanism to break ties in case of multiple matches.\n3.2.2 Crowd Sourcing Crowd sourcing as a solution for extracting attributes for\nproducts is rendered ineffective because of the scale of a major retail catalog. Given the large number of attributes that need to be extracted, potentially for millions of products, the time and cost of crowd sourcing make it prohibitive. In addition, since variations of attribute values may need to be standardized, resolving inter annotator disagreement can be challenging and may require expert intervention.\n3.2.3 Rule based extraction Rule based approaches have had success in certain named\nentity recognition tasks [5], [8], [15]. Such techniques typically leverage the grammatical structure of the language. However, as mentioned earlier in the section, product titles do not conform to a syntactical structure or grammar unlike news articles or prose. An alternative would be to use rule based approaches with product description, but descriptions may contain named entities unrelated to the product such as in comparisons to similar products.\nAnother disadvantage with rule based approaches stems from the number of different attributes that are used by a general retailer to describe products. Typically, a modern retailer deals with tens of thousands of attributes across thousands of product categories. Rule based approaches will need to be tailored for each attribute. Creating and maintaining rules for hundreds or thousands of attributes can be quite challenging. In contrast we were able to easily adapt\nour system with minimal changes to build models for a variety of attributes.\n3.2.4 Supervised text classification Yet another possibility is to use text classification algo-\nrithms such as logistic regression, naive bayes or support vector machines that do not leverage the sequential structure of the data. These algorithms can be suitable for certain attributes, where the number of classes is known and small. In this scenario, classification algorithms can provide great performance. In contrast, when the number of classes is in tens of thousands, we will need a lot labeled training data and the model footprint will also be large. However, the main drawback with these models for attributes like brand and manufacturer part number is that they can only predict classes on which they are trained. Thus, in order to predict new brand values, the training data will need to be constantly updated with labeled data corresponding to new brands. In the case of manufacturer part number, this approach is essentially worthless since every new product will likely have an unseen part number."

      "text" : "Tagging products with attributes falls under the umbrella of knowledge extraction from text. Such problems have been explored in a variety of application areas. We will present a brief survey of similar undertakings in other domains.\nBikel et.al. [2] discuss the named entity extraction problem to identify location names, person names, named organizations and a few other entities. They present a Hidden Markov model and show that it performs favorably on named entity recognition tasks on standard datasets like MUC-6 and MET-1. Ritter et. al. [19] built a system for mining named entities from tweets - which is another example of text that significantly deviates from fluent prose.\nPart of speech tagging is a quintessential example of an entity recognition task and a number of approaches have been investigated in literature. Eric Brill [3] introduced a simple rule based tagger for learning part of speech which was shown to have an error rate of 7.9% when trained on 90% of Brown corpus and tested on a held out 5% subset. Schmid [20] illustrates a probabilistic tagger in which transition probabilities are estimated using a decision tree and which achieves an accuracy of 96.36% on Penn-Treebank data. Ratnaparkhi describes a maximum entropy approach to this problem that achieves an accuracy of 96.6% on Wall Street Journal data in Penn-Treebank.\nAlani et. al. [1] present a system to extract knowledge about artists from web pages leveraging a curated ontology. Kazama and Torisawa [12] use features relying on Wikipedia information to generate a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) based model for named entity recognition. Etzioni et. al. [7] describe unsupervised techniques to extract relationships between entities from web documents.\nThe problems that are the subject of this paper are most similar to the following works. Ghani et. al. [9] discuss the representation of retail products as attribute-value pairs. They tackle the problem of extracting values for a predefined list of attributes like age group, degree of brand appeal and price point. After obtaining an initial expert labeled dataset, they augment it with unlabeled data using ExpectationMaximization. Popescu and Etzioni [17] extend their system described in [7] to the problem of mining product features\nfrom online reviews. Putthividhya and Hu [18] designed a system for extracting product attributes from short listing titles such as those found on eBay. They focus on specific categories - clothing and shoes and on the attributes brand, style, size and color. They compare performance of Hidden Markov models, Maximum Entropy models, Support Vector Machines and CRFs. Beginning with a seed data set of labeled attribute values, they generate additional training data using unlabeled examples. For normalizing variations in the extracted attribute values, they use n-gram substring matching."

Given an input sequence x = x1, x2, ..., xm, a sequence labeling algorithm aims to unearth a label sequence y = y1, y2, ..., ym such that the element xj is labeled yj . The labels yj usually come from a finite set. A typical example of such an approach is part of speech tagging in natural language processing.\nIn this work we evaluated performance using two sequence labeling algorithms - Structured Perceptron and Conditional Random Fields. In section 9 we compare the performance of these models with respect to another sequence labeling algorithm - Hidden Markov model."

A feature function for a sequence labeling algorithm is a function f : X × Y × I → R.\nConsider for example the problem of part of speech tagging. This involves assigning every word in a unit of text (e.g. a sentence) a tag/label corresponding to its part of speech. The tags that appear in Penn Treebank [14] include DT (determiner), JJ (adjective), NN (noun), VB (verb) and IN (preposition). Now let x = (The, quick, brown, fox, jumps, over, the, lazy, dog), y = (DT, JJ, JJ, NN, VB, IN, DT, JJ, NN). We may define a feature function as follows:\nf(x,y, i) =\n{\n1 if xi = the and yi = DT 0 otherwise .\nThen f(x,y, 2) = 0 andf(x,y, 7) = 1. We may also define feature functions that take into account contextual information of tokens in the input sequence. In fact, such features are critical to the success of a sequence labeling algorithm, for otherwise, we might as well build a traditional classifier ignoring the sequence structure. An example of such a feature function is given below:\nf(x,y, i) =\n \n\n1 if xi is capitalized and xi+1 is\nnot capitalized\n0 otherwise\n.\nNote that f(x,y, 1) = 1 and f(x,y, i) = 0 for i 6= 1.

We denote\nF (x,y) = Σmi=1Fi(x,y)\nas the d-dimensional feature vector corresponding to the pair x,y. Note that although F depends on the length of the sequencem, for a given input sequence x, we evaluate F over pairs (x,y) where y varies over candidate label sequences which will all have the same length as the length of x.\nWe will discuss the feature functions used in building models for the brand extraction algorithms in section 7."

      "text" : "In order to capture the variations in which an attribute name may appear in product titles, we needed a sizable training set. However, generating a reasonable sized training data set using manual labeling would require substantial tedious and time consuming effort. Alternatively, we could use the set of products which were already tagged with the corresponding attribute value. However, this approach is susceptible to any noise in the existing tags which was found to be significant.\nWe used a distant supervision approach to build our initial training data set. For each attribute we built regex based rules to programatically annotate product titles as per the labeling scheme in section 6.1. For example, in the case of brand, we only annotated product titles in which the brand name appears exactly as a substring, except possibly for a change in the case and/or the presence or absence of certain special characters. Note that not all brand values appear\nexactly in product titles owing to value normalization which we discuss in more detail in section 8.1. For example the following title\nKimberly-Clark Nitrile Xtra Exam Medium Gloves in Purple\nwith an associated brand attribute value of ‘Kimberly-Clark’ could be included in the training set. However, the title\nBarnett Single Friction Plate Fits 76-79 Yamaha RD400\nwhere the normalized Walmart brand value is ‘Barnett Crossbows’ would not be included since the word ‘Crossbows’ does not appear in the title. In particular, the initial training set did not contain any product titles where the product had a legitimate brand value but which was not contained in the title.\nThis restriction achieved the dual purpose of shielding the training set from noisy labels as well as allowing us to programmatically annotate product titles without the need for any manual labeling. For each such brand name, we included up to three annotated titles to the training set. The reason for this limit was to avoid having a heavily imbalanced dataset since the distribution of the number of items with a given brand name was observed to be heavy tailed.\nNote that although the initial training set did not contain any product titles for which the normalized brand value did not appear in the product title, we were subsequently able to increase the size of the training set with such product titles from the analyst feedback we received during the validation phase (see section 8.3).\nIn addition, we also wanted the algorithm to detect product titles which do not contain any brand name. A couple of examples of such titles were provided in Section 3. To this end, we added a small set of such product titles corresponding to unbranded products where every token was labeled ‘O’."

This labeling is transformed into a candidate brand name using the following steps:\n1. If the label of all tokens of the product title is ‘O’, we posit that a brand name does not appear in the title and output value for the product title is ‘unbranded’. In the notation of section 1.2,\nE(xt) = ‘’ and N(E(xt)) = ‘unbranded’.\n2. Otherwise, there must be a token with the label ‘Bbrand’. Consider the contiguous subsequence of tokens xs satisfying: (a) The label of the first token is ‘B-brand’. (b) If the length of the subsequence is greater than\n1, then the label of each token except the first is ‘I-brand’. (c) The last token in the subsequence is either the last token of the product title or the succeeding token from the product title is labeled ‘O’.\nThe substring of the product title corresponding to xs (if applicable) is considered to be the predicted brand for x i.e. E(xt) = xs. We discuss normalization for this case in section 8.\nNote that each product title corresponds to a unique brand. Thus, every label sequence in the training data consists of at most one ‘B-brand’ label. In practice, label sequences produced by the algorithm also consist of a single ‘B-brand’ label. In the rare case that multiple such sequences exist in a given product title, we deem the predicted brand value to be the one corresponding to the first such subsequence. This heuristic works well with the datasets we analyzed. Depending on the attribute a different strategy for resolving ties may be necessary. Alternately, in the case of multi valued attributes, we may accept all possible subsequences satisfying the above criteria."

As a consequence, an incorrect brand name prediction is rarely itself also a brand name. For example, consider the product title\nSea Gull Lighting Parkfield 3 Light Bath Vanity Light\nwhere the brand name is ‘Sea Gull Lighting’. Assume that we are introducing products from ‘Sea Gull Lighting’ for the first time, and thus said brand is not present in the list of known brands. Further, any substring of this product title consisting of consecutive tokens is not a brand name. This motivated the following post processing scheme which significantly boosted precision of the accepted brand predictions."

Let nTB be the number of products which have a true brand value other than ‘unbranded’. Let nPB be the number of products which have a predicted brand value other than ‘unbranded’. Let c be the number of predictions that are correct and which have a brand value other than ‘unbranded’. Then we define\nPrecision = P = c\nnPB\nand\nRecall = R = c\nnTB .\nThe motivation for computing precision and recall over only items with brand value other than ‘unbranded’ stems from the fact that ‘unbranded’ value is not displayed in facets and thus these metrics more accurately represent the quality of the brand facet. Finally we define F1 measure as usual:\nF1 = 2PR\nP +R\nFor diagnostic purposes we also include the metric - ‘Label Accuracy’ which is the fraction of tokens in the data set that are assigned the correct BIO encoding labels i.e. {B-brand, I-brand, O}. Although by itself a high label accuracy does not imply a good sequence labeling, we can get meaningful information from this metric when used in combination with precision and recall.\nAdditionally, for the LCCRF model, we define Precision and Recall as functions of the threshold θ of the conditional probability of the predicted label sequence [11]. Let XT denote the set of all sequences in the test set. For x̃ ∈ XT , suppose the LCCRF model predicts a label sequence ỹ and let the correct label sequence for x̃ be ỹt. Let ol denote a label sequence of length l in which every label is ‘O’ (note\nthat this translates to an output brand label of ‘unbranded’). Let I [·] denote the indicator function. Then we define\nPrecision(θ) = P (θ) =\nΣx̃∈XT I [(Pr(ỹ|x̃) ≥ θ) and ỹ 6=o|y| and ỹ = ỹt]\nΣx̃∈XT I [(Pr(ỹ|x̃) ≥ θ) and ỹ 6=o|ỹ|]\nand\nRecall(θ) = R(θ) =\nΣx̃∈XT I [(Pr(ỹ|x̃) ≥ θ) and ỹ 6=o|y| and ỹ = ỹt]\nΣx̃∈XT I [ỹt 6=o|ỹt|] .\nNote that in particular, P (θ = 0) = P and R(θ = 0) = R."

      "text" : "We built a training set consisting of 61,374 product titles from a selected set of product categories, annotated with a brand attribute value. We performed a 10-fold cross validation for hyperparameter selection and computing model metrics.\nWe compare the results of SP and LCCRF models to a number of baseline approaches.\n9.2.1 Nearest Neighbors models The nearest neighbors model was chosen for comparison\nfor two main reasons: 1. The number of distinct brand labels in the training set\nis 25,851. 2. The number of times a particular brand label appears\nin the training set is between 1-9. The actual distribution of the frequency of the brand labels in the training set is shown below.\nGiven the large number of classes and since over 95% of labels appear 3 times or less in the training set, there is very little training data per class to train an effective model using text classification techniques.\nTo obtain the nearest neighbors benchmarks, we used a bag of words model where each token was encoded using its tf-idf score and the nearest neighbors were obtained using cosine similarity. Given the frequency of labels shown above,\nwe compare our results to those of k nearest neighbors models with k equal to 1 (1NN) and 3 (3NN). For 3NN, in case all three closest neighbors corresponded to distinct labels, the label with the highest cosine similarity was chosen i.e. the result would coincide with that of 1NN in this case. All results were obtained using a 10-fold cross validation.\nNote that since some labels appear only once, if such a label occurs in the test set during cross validation, both 1NN and 3NN would be incapable of producing the correct result. However, considering one of the goals of the attribute extraction system is to discover new attribute values, this situation closely models the reality of the data.\n9.2.2 Dictionary based approaches\nFor dictionary based benchmarks, we compile a lexicon of brands that appear in the training data with some preprocessing (lowercasing and tokenization). Given a test title, we perform the same preprocessing and we search for the presence of any brand from the lexicon in the title. We show the results from two approaches that were obtained from the heuristic used to resolve multiple matches:\n1. Dict-max: In case of multiple matches, we choose the match with the largest number of characters. 2. Dict-first: In case of multiple matches, we choose the match that appears earliest in the title.\n9.2.3 Hidden Markov Model\nFor an input sequence x = x1, x2, ..., xm, and a label sequence y = y1, y2, ..., ym, a second-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM) defines the joint probability of the input and label sequences as follows\nPr(x1, x2, ..., xm, y1, y2, ..., ym) = Πm+1i=1 Pr(yi|yi−2, yi−1)Π m i=1Pr(xi|yi)\nwhere y−1, y0 = START and ym+1 = STOP are special labels. The probabilities on the right hand side of the above equation are parameters of the HMM and can be estimated from a training set of input and label sequences using maximum likelihood estimation. Given a test sequence, the label sequence that maximizes the above joint probability is chosen.\nIn estimating probabilities for unknown words, we mapped them to one of several morphological classes similar to [2].\n9.2.4 Model comparisons\nThe results for all models are shown below. The error margins indicate two standard errors.\nLCCRF and SP outperform the rest of the models and yield similar performance. The metrics for these models also meet business specifications at Walmart to power algorithmic solutions to extract product metdata.\nThe high label accuracy compared to the precision of the algorithm indicates a crucial fact that we exploited for post processing. In a large number of cases even when the predicted sequence labeling was incorrect, almost all the tokens still had the right label. What we observed was that the false positive brand value predictions typically were either subsequences or supersequences of the expected unnormalized brand. Due to this, we were able to employ the normalization scheme to improve both precision and recall further.\nWe will illustrate this with an example. Consider the following product title\nPlum Island Silver SC-007 Sterling Silver Fairy Piece Ear Cuff\nthat contains the brand name ‘Plum Island Silver’. Suppose the sequence labeling algorithm incorrectly extracts the brand value as ‘Plum Island’. In such a case, we add the pair (‘Plum Island’, ‘Plum Island Silver’) to the normalization dictionary while adding the above title in the training set with the correctly annotated brand. In a subsequent run, it’s highly likely that either the algorithm adapts and correctly predicts the brand or still returns the previous truncated value. However, even in the latter case, the normalization scheme will correctly pick the desired normalized value."

      "text" : "The system is easily extended to a number of other attributes where we may not have a pre compiled list of possible attribute values or when such a list is large and may undergo frequent changes. Some examples include manufacturer specific model numbers and names, fictional characters that inspire children’s toys, sports team and league names for sports branded apparel and memorabilia, product lines, etc. The approach presented above is readily amenable for the extraction of such attributes. Most of the methodology remains similar to that used for brands. We were able to use the same algorithms, similar set of features, distant supervision to produce annotated product titles for training and normalization schemes for standardization of variations of attributes values to build models with high precision and recall for such attributes."

      "heading" : "11. REAL WORLD PERFORMANCE",
      "text" : "We used the approach presented above to extract brands for a subset of products in selected departments. Early results from algorithmic extraction were manually validated by analysts. The normalization dictionary was regularly updated based on analyst feedback. For the manually validated batches, post normalization precision varied between 92%-95% showing an improvement between 1%-3% over algorithmically extracted values. Sample validations of the products categorized as unbranded revealed that over 98% of those were indeed true negatives. The algorithm was able to ‘discover’ over a thousand brand values which were not part of the Walmart brand database at that point.\nWe estimated the impact of brand value extraction on product discoverability using the R package CausalImpact [4]. For the following analysis, the brand attribute value was extracted and used to augment product data for 272,697 products on the same day. We measured the impressions for this set of products during 44 days prior and 27 days following 3 this intervention conditioned on the brand facet being applied. The results of the analysis are shown below.\nThe plot consists of three panels. The solid line in the top panel shows the actual daily impressions for the set of products. The first vertical dotted line indicates the day of intervention (products augmented with brand metadata). The second vertical line marks the end of the measurement. The blue dotted time series in the first panel is the predicted counterfactual - how the impressions would have tracked in the absence of the intervention. The second panel shows the difference between the observed impressions and the counterfactual predictions while the final plot shows the cumulative difference. The synthetical control was constructed from products from similar categories for which no brand\n3these choices were motivated by the choice of series to create a synthetic control\nmetadata was augmented. The model predicts over 250K additional impressions during the test period for the set of items for which the brand metadata was supplied. Similar analysis for other attributes for which attribute extraction was employed typically suggests a positive impact on impressions and depending on the attribute also on other metrics of interest such as clicks, add to cart rate and orders.\nSo far, the attribute extraction system has been deployed for extracting over 20 attributes. We build a separate model for each attribute for several reasons. A given attribute is typically applicable to only a particular set of categories (for e.g. brand may not be an important attribute for books while sports team may not be applicable for electronic tablet devices). Building a separate model for each attribute allows us to independently train each model and tune the performance based on business needs. The size of the training set varies between a few hundred titles to tens of thousands depending on the attribute."

We discussed the importance of attribute extraction for retail websites. We examined the challenges associated with this task especially when the product catalog is large. Attribute extraction from product titles was modeled as a sequence labeling problem. We also illustrated a method to leverage existing products tagged with attribute values to build the initial training data set without manual labeling. The experimental results show that SP or LCCRF models combined with a curated normalization scheme provide an efficacious mechanism for tagging products with certain attribute values with high precision and recall."

The absence of syntactic structure in such short pieces of text makes extracting attribute values a challenging problem. We find that combining sequence labeling algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields and Structured Perceptron with a curated normalization scheme produces an effective system for the task of extracting product attribute values from titles. To keep the discussion concrete, we will illustrate the mechanics of the system from the point of view of a particular attribute brand. We also discuss the importance of an attribute extraction system in the context of retail websites with large product catalogs, compare our approach to other potential approaches to this problem and end the paper with a discussion of the performance of our system for extracting attributes.",
