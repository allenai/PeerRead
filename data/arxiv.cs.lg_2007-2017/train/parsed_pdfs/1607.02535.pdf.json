      "text" : "Massive multiway data emerge from many fields: spacetime measurements on several variables in climate dynamics (Hasselmann, 1997), multichannel EEG signals in neurology (Acar et al., 2007) and natural images sequences in computer vision (Vasilescu & Terzopoulos, 2002). Tensor provides a natural representation for multiway data. In particular, tensor decomposition has been a popular technique for exploratory data analysis (Kolda & Bader, 2009) and has been extensively studied. In contrast, tensor regression, which aims to learn a model with multi-linear parameters, is especially suitable for applications with multi-directional relatedness, but has not been fully examined. For example, in a task that predicts multiple climate variables at different locations and time, the data can be indexed by variable × location × time. Tensor regression provides us with a concise way of modeling complex structures in multiway data.\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\nMany tensor regression methods have been proposed (Zhao et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2013; Romera-Paredes et al., 2013; Wimalawarne et al., 2014; Signoretto et al., 2014), leading to a broad range of successful applications ranging from neural science to climate research to social network analysis. These methods share the assumption that the model parameters form a high order tensor and there exists a lowdimensional factorization for the model tensor. They can be summarized into two types of approaches: (1) alternating least square (ALS) sequentially finds the factor that minimizes the loss while keeping others fixed; (2) spectral regularization approximates the original non-convex problem with a convex surrogate loss, such as the nuclear norm of the unfolded tensor.\nA clear drawback of all the algorithms mentioned above is high computational cost. ALS displays unstable convergence properties and outputs sub-optimal solutions (Cichocki et al., 2009). Trace-norm minimization suffers from slow convergence (Gandy et al., 2011). Moreover, those methods face the memory bottleneck when dealing with large-scale datasets. ALS, for example, requires the matricization of entire data tensor at every mode. In addition, most existing algorithms are largely constrained by the specific tensor regression model. Adapting one algorithm to a new regression model involves derivations for all the updating steps, which can be tedious and sometimes non-trivial.\nIn this paper, we introduce subsampled Tensor Projected Gradient (TPG), a simple and fast recipe to address the challenge. It is an efficient solver for a variety of tensor regression problems. The memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the problem. Our algorithm is based upon projected gradient descent (Calamai & Moré, 1987) and can also be seen as a tensor generalization of iterative hard thresholding algorithm (Blumensath & Davies, 2009). At each projection step, our algorithm iteratively returns a set of leading singular vectors of the model, avoiding full singular value decomposition (SVD). To handle large sample size, we employ randomized sketching for subsampling and noise reduction to further accelerate the process.\nWe provide theoretical analysis of our algorithm, which is guaranteed to find the correct solution under the Restricted\nar X\niv :1\n60 7.\n02 53\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nJ ul\n2 01\n6\nIsometry Property (RIP) assumption. In fact, the algorithm only needs a fixed number of iterations, depending solely on the logarithm of signal to noise ratio. It is also robust to noise, with estimation error depending linearly on the size of the observation error. The proposed method is simple and easy to implement. At the same time, it enjoys fast convergence rate and superior robustness. We demonstrate the empirical performance on two example applications: multilinear multi-task learning and multivariate spatio-temporal forecasting. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing approaches in both prediction accuracy and speed."

      "text" : "Several algorithms have been proposed for tensor regression. For example, (Zhou et al., 2013) proposes to use Alternating least square (ALS) algorithm. (Romera-Paredes et al., 2013) employs ALS as well as an Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) technique to solve the nuclear norm regularized optimization problem. (Signoretto et al., 2014) proposes a more general version of ADMM based on Douglas-Rachford splitting method. Both ADMM-based algorithms try to solve a convex relaxation of the original optimization problem, using singular value soft-thresholding. To address the scalability issue of these methods, (Yu et al., 2014) proposes a greedy algorithm following the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) scheme. Though significantly faster, it requires the matricization of the data tensor, and thus would face memory bottleneck when dealing with large sample size.\nOur work is closely related to iterative hard thresholding in compressive sensing (Blumensath & Davies, 2009), spar-\nsified gradient descent in sparse recovery (Garg & Khandekar, 2009) or singular value projection method in lowrank matrix completion (Jain et al., 2010). We generalize the idea of iterative hard thresholding to tensors and utilize several tensor specific properties to achieve acceleration. We also leverage randomized sampling technique, which concerns how to sample data to accelerate the common learning algorithms. Specifically, we employ count sketch (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2013) as a pre-processing step to alleviate the memory bottleneck for large dataset."

      "text" : "Given a predictor tensor X and a response tensor Y , tensor regression targets at the following problem:\nW? = argmin W L(W;X ,Y)\ns.t. rank(W) ≤ R (1)\nThe problem aims to estimate a model tensor W ∈ RD1×D2×D3 that minimizes the empirical loss L, subject to the constraint that the Tucker rank of W is at most R. Equivalent, the model tensor W has a low-dimensional factorization W = S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3 with core S ∈ RR1×R2×R3 and orthonormal projection matrices {Un ∈ RDn×Rn}. The dimensionality of S is at most R. The reason we favor Tucker rank over others is due to the fact that it is a high order generalization of matrix SVD, thus is computational tractable, and carries nice properties that we later would utilize.\nMany existing tensor regression models are special cases of the problem in (1). For example, in multi-linear multitask learning (Romera-Paredes et al., 2013), given the predictor and response for each task (Xt,Yt), the empirical loss is defined as the summarization of the loss for all the tasks, i.e., L(W;X ,Y) = ∑T t=1 ‖Yt − Xtwt‖2F , with wt as the tth column of W(1). For the univariate GLM model in (Zhou et al., 2013), the model is defined as Y = vec(X )T vec(W)+E . Table 1 summarizes existing tensor regression models, their algorithms as well as main application domains. In this work, we use the simple linear regression model Y = 〈X ,W〉 + E to illustrate our idea, where X ∈ RT×D1×D3 , Y ∈ RT×D2×D3 with sample size T , and E as i.i.d Gaussian noise. The tensor inner product 〈X ,W〉 is defined as the matrix multiplication on each slice independently, i.e., 〈X ,W〉 = ∑M m=1 X:,:,m,W:,:,m.

      "heading" : "4.2. Tensor Projected Gradient",
      "text" : "To solve problem (1), we propose a simple and efficient tensor regression algorithm: subsampled Tensor Projected Gradient (TPG). TPG is based upon the prototypical method of projected gradient descent and can also be seen as a tensor generalization of iterative hard thresholding algorithm (Blumensath & Davies, 2009). For the projection step, we resort to tensor power iterations to iteratively search for the leading singular vectors of the model tensor. We further leverage randomized sketching (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2013) to address the memory bottleneck and speed up the algorithm.\nAs shown in Algorithm 1, subsampled Tensor Projected Gradient (TPG) combines a gradient step with a proximal point projection step (Rockafellar, 1976). The gradient step treats (1) as an unconstrained optimization ofW . As long as the loss function is differentiable in a neighborhood of current solution, standard gradient descent methods can be applied. For our case, computing the gradient under linear model is trivial: OL(W;X ,Y) = 〈X T ,Y − 〈X ,W〉〉. After the gradient step, the subsequent proximal point step aims to find a projection PR(W) : RD1×D2×D3 → RD1×D2×D3 satisfying:\nPR(Wk) = argmin W (‖Wk −W‖2F )\ns.t. W ∈ C(R) = {W : rank(W) ≤ R} (2)\nThe difficulty of solving the above problem mainly comes from the non-convexity of the set of low-rank tensors. A common approach is to use nuclear norm as a convex surrogate to approximate the rank constraint (Gandy et al., 2011). The resulting problem can either be solved by SemiDefinite Programming (SDP) or soft-thresholding of the singular values. However, both algorithms are computational expensive. Soft-thresholding, for example, requires a full SVD for each unfolding of the tensor.\nAlgorithm 1 Subsampled Tensor Projected Gradient 1: Input: predictor X , response Y , rank R 2: Output: model tensorW ∈ RD1×D2×D3 3: Compute count sketch S 4: Sketch Ỹ ← Y ×1 S, X̃ ← X ×1 S 5: InitializeW0 as zero tensor 6: repeat 7: W̃k+1 =Wk − ηOL(Wk; X̃ , Ỹ) 8: Wk+1 = ITP(W̃k+1) 9: until Converge\nIterative hard thresholding, on the other hand, avoids full SVD. It takes advantage of the general Eckart-YoungMirsky theorem (Eckart & Young, 1936) for matrices,\nAlgorithm 2 Iterative Tensor Projection (ITP) 1: Input: model W̃ , predictor X , response Y , rank R 2: Output: projectionW ∈ RD1×D2×D3 3: Initialize {U0n} with R left singular vectors ofW(n) 4: while i ≤ R do 5: repeat 6: uk+11 ← W̃ ×2 uk2 T ×3 uk3 T\n7: uk+12 ← W̃ ×1 uk1 T ×3 uk3 T 8: uk+13 ← W̃ ×1 uk1 T ×2 uk2 T\n9: until Converge to {u1,u2,u3} 10: Update {Un} with {un} 11: W ← W̃ ×1 U1U1T ×2 U2U2T ×3 U3U3T 12: if L(W;X ,Y) ≤ then 13: RETURN 14: end if 15: end while\nwhich allows the Euclidean projection to be efficiently computed with thin SVD. Iterative hard thresholding algorithm has been shown to be memory efficient and robust to noise. Unfortunately, it is well-known that EckartYoung-Mirsky theorem no long applies to higher order tensors (Kolda & Bader, 2009). Therefore, computing highorder singular value decomposition (HOSVD) (De Lathauwer et al., 2000b) and discarding small singular values do not guarantee optimality of the projection.\nTo address the challenge, we note that for tensor Tucker model, we have : W = S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3. And the projection matrices {Un} happen to be the left singular vectors of the unfolded tensor, i.e., UnΣnVTn =W(n). This property allows us to compute each projection matrix efficiently with thin SVD. By iterating over all factors, we can obtain a local optimal solution that is guaranteed to have rank at mostR. We want to emphasize that there is no known algorithm that can guarantee the convergence to the global optimal solution. However, in the Tucker model, different local optimas are highly concentrated, thus the choice of local optima does not really matter (Ishteva et al., 2011b).\nWhen the model parameter tensor W is very large, performing thin SVD itself can be expensive. In our problem, the dimensionality of the model is usually much larger than its rank. With this observation, we utilize another property of Tucker model Un = W ×1 · · · ×n−1 UTn−1 ×n+1 UTn+1 · · · ×N UN . This property implies that instead of performing thin SVD on the original tensor, we can trade cheap tensor matrix multiplication to avoid expensive large matrix SVD. This leads to the Iterative Tensor Projection (ITP) procedure as described in Algorithm 2. Denote {un} as row vectors of {Un}, ITP uses power iteration to find one leading singular vector at a time. The algorithm stops\neither when hitting the rank upper bound R or when the loss function value decreases below a threshold .\nITP is significantly faster than traditional tensor regression algorithms especially when the model is low-rank. It guarantees that the proximal point projection step can be solved efficiently. If we initialize our solution with the top R left singular vectors of tensor unfoldings, the projection iteration can start from a close neighborhood of the stationary point, thus leading to faster convergence. In tensor regression, our main focus is to minimize the empirical loss. Sequentially finding the rank-1 subspace allows us to evaluate the performance as the algorithm proceeds. The decrease of empirical loss would call for early stop of the thin SVD procedure.\nAnother acceleration trick we employ is randomized sketching. This trick is particularly useful when we are encountered with ultra high sample size or extremely sparse data. Online algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent or stochastic ADMM are common techniques to deal with large samples and break the memory bottleneck. However, from a subsampling point of view, online algorithms make i.i.d assumptions of the data and uniformly select samples. It usually fails to leverage the data sparsity.\nIn our framework, the convergence of the TPG algorithm, as will be discussed in a later section, depends only on the logarithm of signal to noise ratio. Randomized sketching instantiates the mechanism to reduce noise by duplicating data instances and combining the outputs. This mechanism provides TPG with considerable amount of boost. Its performance therefore increases linearly if the noise is decreased. We resort to count sketch (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2013) as a subsampling step before feeding data into TPG. A count sketch matrix of size M × N , denoted as S, is generated as follows: start with a zero matrix RM×N , for each column j, uniformly pick a row i ∈ {1, 2, · · ·M} and assign {−1, 1} with equal probability to Si,j . In practice, we find count sketch works well with TPG, even when the sample size is very small."

      "heading" : "5. Theoretical Analysis",
      "text" : "We now analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm. We prove that TPG guarantees optimality of the estimated solution, under the assumption that the predictor tensor satisfies Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) (Candes et al., 2006). With carefully designed step size, the algorithm converges to the correct solution in constant number of iterations, and the achievable estimation error depends linearly on the size of the observation error.\nWe assume the predictor tensor satisfies Restricted Isometry Property in the following form:\nDefinition 5.1. (Restricted Isometry Property) The isom-\netry constant of X is the smallest number δR such as the following holds for allW with Tucker rank at most R.\n(1− δR)‖W‖2F ≤ ‖〈X ,W〉‖2F ≤ (1 + δR)‖W‖2F\nNote that even though we make the RIP analogy for tensor X , we actually impose the RIP assumption w.r.t. matrix rank instead of tensor rank. Similar assumption can be found in (Rauhut et al., 2015).\nThe proposed solution TPG as in Algorithm 1 is built upon projected gradient method. To prove the convergence, we first guarantee the optimality (local) of the proximal point step, obtained by ITP in Algorithm 2. The following lemma guarantees the correctness of the solution from ITP. Lemma 5.2. (Tensor Projection) The projection step in Algorithm 2, defined as PR : RD1×D2×D3 → RD1×D2×D3 computes a proximal point PR(W̃k+1) = Wk+1, whose Tucker rank is at most R. Formally,\nWk+1 = argmin W ‖W − W̃k+1‖2F s.t rank(W) ≤ R\nthe projected solutionWk+1 follows a Tucker model, written as Wk+1 = S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3, where each dimension of the core S is upper bounded by R.\nProof. Minimizing ‖W − W̃k+1‖2F given S is equivalent to minimizing the following problem\n‖S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3 − W̃k+1‖2F = {‖S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3‖2F − 2〈S ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 U3, W̃k+1〉+ ‖W̃k+1‖2F } = {‖S‖2F + ‖W̃k+1‖2F − 2〈S, W̃k+1 ×1 UT1 ×2 UT2 ×3 UT3 〉} = −‖S‖2F + ‖W̃k+1‖2F\nGiven projection matrices {Un}, we have:\nS = W̃k+1 ×1 UT1 ×2 UT2 ×3 UT3 Thus, the minimizer of ‖W−W̃k+1‖2F generates projection matrices that maximize the following objective function:\n{Un} = argmax {Un} ‖W̃k+1 ×1 UT1 ×2 UT2 ×3 UT3 ‖2F (3)\nEach row vector un of Un can be solved independently with power iteration. Therefore, repeating this procedure for different modes leads to an optimal (local) minimizer near a neighborhood of W̃k+1. In fact, for Tucker tensor, convergence to a saddle point or a local maximum is only observed in artificially designed numerical examples (Ishteva et al., 2011a).\nNext we prove our main theorem, which states that TPG converges to the correct solution in constant number of iterations with isometry constant δ2R < 1/3.\nTheorem 5.3. (Main) For tensor regression model Y = 〈X ,W〉+ E , suppose the predictor tensor X satisfies RIP condition with isometry constant δ2R < 1/3. Let W? be the optimal tensor of Tucker rank at most R. Then tensor projected gradient (TPG) algorithm with step-size η = 11+δR computes a feasible solution W such that the estimation error ‖W − W?‖2F ≤ 11−δ2R ‖E‖ 2 F in at most d 1log(1/α) log( ‖Y‖2F ‖E|2F\n)e iterations for an universal constance α that is independent of problem parameters.\nProof. : The decrease in loss\nL(Wk+1)− L(Wk) (4) = 2〈OL(Wk),Wk+1 −Wk〉+ ‖〈X ,Wk+1 −Wk〉‖2F ≤ 2〈OL(Wk),Wk+1 −Wk〉+ (1 + δ2R)‖Wk+1 −Wk ‖2F\nHere the inequality follows from RIP condition. And isometry constant of δ2R follows from the subadditivity of rank.\nDefine upper bound\nu(W) := 2〈OL(Wk),W −Wk〉+ (1 + δ2R)‖W −Wk ‖2F = (1 + δ2R){‖W − W̃k+1‖2F − 〈OL(Wk),W −Wk〉}\nwhere the second equality follows from the definition of gradient step W̃k+1 =Wk − ηOL(Wk) From Equation (4) and Lemma 5.2,\nL(Wk+1)− L(Wk) ≤ u(Wk+1) ≤ u(W?)

Given model assumption Y − 〈X ,W?〉 = E , we have\n‖〈X ,W? −Wk〉‖2F = ‖Y − 〈X ,Wk〉 − E‖2F = L(Wk)− 2〈E ,Y − 〈X ,Wk〉〉+ ‖E‖2F\n≤ L(Wk) + 2 C L(Wk) + 1 C2 L(Wk) = (1 + 1\nC )2L(Wk) (9)\nas long as the noise satisfies C2‖E‖2F ≤ L(Wk).\nFollowing Equation (8),\nL(Wk+1) ≤ ‖E‖2F + 2δ2R\n1− δ2R (1 +\n1 C )2L(Wk)\n≤ [ 1 C2 + 2δ2R 1− δ2R (1 + 1 C )2]L(Wk) = αL(Wk) (10)\nWith the assumption that δ2R < 1/3, select C > 1+δ2R1−3δ2R , we have [ 1C2 + 2δ2R 1−δ2R (1 + 1 C )\n2] < 1. The above inequality implies that the algorithm enjoys a globally geometric convergence rate and the loss decreases multiplicatively.\nFor the simplest case, with initial point as zero, we have L(W0) = ‖Y‖2F .\nIn order to obtain a loss value that is small enough\nL(WK) ≤ αKL(W0) ≤ ‖E‖2F (11)\nthe algorithm requires at least K ≥ 1log(1/α) log( ‖Y‖2F ‖E|2F\n) iterations.\n‖WK −W?‖2F ≤ 1\n1− δ2R ‖〈X ,WK −W?〉‖2F (12)\n≤ 1 1− δ2R (1 + 1 C )2L(WK) ≤ 1 1− δ2R ‖E‖2F\nwhere inequality (12) follows from RIP.\nTheorem 5.3 shows that under RIP assumption, TGP converges to an approximate solution in O( 1log(1/α) log( ‖Y‖2F ‖E|2F\n)) number of iterations, which depends solely on the logarithm of signal to noise ratio. The achievable estimation error depends linearly on the size of the observation error.\nAs a pre-processing step, our proposed algorithm employs l2-subspace embedding (count sketch) to subsample the data instances.\nDefinition 5.4. (l2-subspace embedding) A (1 ± ) l2subspace embedding for the column space of a N ×D matrix A is a matrix S for which for all x ∈ RD\n‖SAx‖22 = (1± )‖Ax‖22\nSubsampling step solves an unconstrained optimization problem which is essentially a least square problem, the approximation error can be upper-bounded as follows:\nLemma 5.5. (Approximation Guarantee) For any 0 < δ < 1, given a sparse l2-subspace embedding matrix S with K = O((D1D2D3)2/δ 2) rows, then with probability (1 − δ), we can achieve (1 + )-approximation. The sketch X ×1 S can be computed in O(nnz(X )) time, and Y ×1 S can be computed in O(nnz(Y)) time.\nThe result follows directly from (Clarkson & Woodruff, 2013). The randomized sketching leads to a (1 + ) approximation of the original tensor regression solution. It also serves as a noise reduction step, facilitating fast convergence of subsequent TPG procedure."

We compare with MLMTLC and multi-task feature learning baselines in the original paper. MTL-L21 uses L21 regularizer and MTL-Trace is the trace-norm regularized multi-task learning algorithm. The model parameters are selected by minimizing the mean squared error on the validation set.\nFigure 2 demonstrates the prediction performance in terms of MSE and runtime with respect to different training size. Compared with MLMTL-C, TPG is around 10% − 25% more accurate and at least 20 times faster. MTL-L21 or MTL-Trace runs faster than MLMTL-C but also sacrifices accuracy. The difference is more noticeable in the case of small training size. These results are not surprising. Given limited samples and highly correlated tasks in the restaurant score prediction, the model parameters demonstrate low-rank property. In fact, we found that rank 1 is the opti-\nmal setting for this data during the experiments."

      "text" : "For the spatio-temporal forecasting task, we experiment with following two datasets.\nFoursquare Check-In The Foursquare check-in data set contains the users check-in records in Pittsburgh area from Feb 24 to May 23, 2012, categorized by different venue types such as Art & Entertainment, College & University, and Food. We extract hourly check-in records of 739 users in 34 different venues categories over 3, 474 hours time period as well as users’ friendship network.\nUSHCN Measurements The U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) daily (http://cdiac.ornl. gov/ftp/ushcn_daily/) contains daily measurements for 5 climate variables for more than 100 years. The five climate variables correspond to temperature max, temperature min, precipitation, snow fall and snow depth. The records were collected across more than 1, 200 locations and spans over 45, 384 time stamps.\nWe split the data along the temporal dimension into 80% training set and 20% testing set. We choose VAR (3) model and use 5-fold cross-validation to select the rank during the training phase. For both datasets, we normalize each individual time series by removing the mean and dividing by standard deviation. Due to the memory constraint of the Greedy algorithm, evaluations are conducted on downsampled datasets.\nTable 2 presents the best forecasting performance (w.r.t sketching size) and the corresponding run time for each of the methods. TPG outperforms baseline methods with higher accuracy. Greedy shows similar accuracy, but TPG converges in very few iterations. For USHCN, TPG achieves much higher accuracy with significantly shorter run time. Those results demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithm for spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.\nWe further investigate the learned structure of TPG algorithm from USHCN data. Figure 3 shows the spatialtemporal dependency graph on the terrain of California.\n1cov(X ,W) : Y··· ,in−1in+1··· ,jn−1jn+1,··· = ∑ in XinWin\nEach velocity vector represents the aggregated weight learned by TPG from one location to the other. The graph provides an interesting illustration of atmospheric circulation. For example, near Shasta-Trinity National forecast in northern California, the air flow into the forecasts. On the east side along Rocky mountain area, there is a strong atmospheric pressure, leading to wind moving from south east to north west passing the bay area. Another notable atmospheric circulation happens near Salton sea at the border of Utah, caused mainly by the evaporation of the sea."

      "heading" : "8. Discussion",
      "text" : "The implication of our approach has several interesting aspects that might shed light upon future algorithmic design.\n(1) The projection step in TPG does not depends on data, thus it connects to tensor decomposition techniques such as high order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) (De Lathauwer et al., 2000a). However, there is subtle difference in that the regression would call for early stop of iterative projection as it sequentially search for the orthogonal subspaces.\n(2) TPG behaves similarly as first order methods. The convergence rate can be further improved with second order Newton method. This can be done easily by replacing the gradient with Hessian. This modification does not affect the theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm, but would lead to significant empirical improvement (Jain et al., 2010)."

      "heading" : "9. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we study tensor regression as a tool to analyze multiway data. We introduce Tensor Projected Gradient to solve the problem. Our approach is built upon projected gradient method, generalizing iterative hard thresholding technique to high order tensors. The algorithm is very sim-\nple and general, which can be easily applied to many tensor regression models. It also shares the efficiency of iterative hard thresholding method. We prove that the algorithm converges within a constant number of iterations and the achievable estimation error is linear to the size of the noise. We evaluate our method on multi-linear multi-task learning as well as spatio-temporal forecasting applications. The results show that the our method is significantly faster and is impressively robust to noise."

    "abstractText" : "Tensor regression has shown to be advantageous in learning tasks with multi-directional relatedness. Given massive multiway data, traditional methods are often too slow to operate on or suffer from memory bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce subsampled tensor projected gradient to solve the problem. Our algorithm is impressively simple and efficient. It is built upon projected gradient method with fast tensor power iterations, leveraging randomized sketching for further acceleration. Theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm converges to the correct solution in fixed number of iterations. The memory requirement grows linearly with the size of the problem. We demonstrate superior empirical performance on both multi-linear multi-task learning and spatio-temporal applications.",
