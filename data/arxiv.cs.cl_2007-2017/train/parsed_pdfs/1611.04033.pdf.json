It contains over a billion and a half words in total, out of which, there is about three million unique words. The data were collected from newspaper articles in ten major news sources from eight Arabic countries, over a period of fourteen years. The corpus was encoded with two types of encoding, namely: UTF-8, and Windows CP-1256. Also it was marked with two mark-up languages, namely: SGML, and XML."

      "text" : "The efficiency of any information retrieval systems mainly depends on the experiments conducted by the researchers in the field, and commercial companies producing these systems. These experiments are done to emulate real world queries submitted to any system and the response of it to these queries. It is usually conducted in a closed laboratory environment. Elements of the retrieval process in this type of experiments are controlled by the researchers, in order to determine causes of success or failure and fixing it.\nLanguage corpora are one of the most important elements for information retrieval experiments in particular and for natural language processing in general. This is because the corpus represents the actual everyday use of the language. Corpus use in retrieval has improved significantly in most languages especially Latin based languages. As for Arabic language it is still relatively new.\nArabic Language is the language of the holy Quran. It is used by more than a billion and a half Muslims around the world in the daily rituals. It is the mother tongue of about two hundred and fifty"

      "text" : "Web scrapping or web copying programs\nwere used to extract text from news sources in order to create the corpus. The researchers used wget (1), which is used by LDC, and htttrack (2) site copier, but both were very slow, so they were not used. Two other program, Internet Download Manager (3), cyotek webcopy (4), were used and eliminated as well because they stop working for no apparent reason, in addition to being slow. After several attempts the researcher used MetaProducts Offline Explorer Pro(5), Visual Web Ripper (6). Both programs were very good in extracting text and eliminating all unnecessary objects like images, videos, JavaScript files, and CSS files.\n3.1 Corpus Sources:\nThere are a lot of news sources that could be used for creating a language corpus. At this paper, the researcher has chosen ten sources to be used"

The fame of the website, and the news source, or the number of readers were not the criterion for selection. There were other criteria and technical reasons for selecting the news resources used in building the corpus.\n The first criterion is having no overlap with previous Arabic corpora. For example, Al-\nAhram newspaper from Egypt has the largest digital news archive on the internet, but were not selected because it is a part of the Arabic Gigaword Corpus.\n The source should be online for a long time. This is simply to have a large volume\nof articles available. This was perhaps one the major obstacles in conducting this study. Knowing when the newspaper appeared online, was a problem. There was no way of knowing that without checking each one individually since there is no website that could have this information.\n All selected sources should represent different countries in the Arab world.\n The scrapped text should be in an editable form.\n The selected news source website should allow the crawling programs to work on it\nand import the articles. Some websites have very tight security procedures, and do not allow spidering. It should be noted that the news websites crawling was done between December 2013 and June 2014. Two of the sites, almustaqbal, sabanews, were re-crawled because of errors discovered in the quality control phase. There was a problem importing the publication date in them.\nTable two, indicates the selected sources for the corpus, its name in English and in Arabic, its abbreviation, the time period for each one of them, country of origin, and its website. Nine newspapers, and one news agency from eight countries were selected as shown in the table. Egypt and Saudi Arabia are represented with two newspapers each, since they are the pioneers in online journalism, and have some of the oldest online newspapers in the Arab world.\nThe coverage period varies from one source to the other. The starting time in each news source is basically the time it first appeared online. The ending date depended on the time of the data collection. Some websites allowed harvesting the news archive but not the current news like Alyaum from Saudi Arabia, and Almasryalyoum from Egypt.\n3.2 Metadata:\nTwo tagging schemes were used with the corpus in hand. All articles in the current corpus were tagged with SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), which is used in TREC corpora. The other scheme was using XML (Extensible Markup Language) tagging, which is used in the LDC corpora.\n7. https://msdn.microsoft.com/enus/goglobal/cc305149.aspx\nEach article will have an ID using the source ab-\nbreviation, table one, Arabic language abbrevia-\ntion, and a serial number, e.g.\n<ID> RYD_ARB_0000001 </ID>, or\n<DOCNO> RYD_ARB_0000001 </DOCNO>.\n3.3 Encoding:\nThe corpus will be encoded with windows cp1256(7) for Arabic language. It will also be encoded with UTF-8(8). Having two versions of the corpus with two different encoding schemes will be of great use for researchers in the field of Arabic information retrieval, and Natural language processing."

      "heading" : "4 Results",
      "text" : "As mentioned earlier, the corpus by itself is useless unless it is used to serve some a research area. The main purpose for creating this corpus, is to have a free tool for Arabic language available for researcher. It is made specifically for work in the field of information retrieval, or natural language processing.\nThe corpus is not limited to one subject. It is multitopic news corpus covering Politics, literature, arts, technology, sports, economy, culture, and many other subject matters. It is also, a good representation of Arabic language. It covers a period of fourteen years and eight countries. These countries have a very large portion of Arabic native speakers. Finally, all ten sources used in creating the corpus are well represented.\nTable three shows the statistics of the corpus in details, and what has been assembled from each source of ten sources. It includes the number and percentage of articles that have been imported from each source, and the total number and percentage of words and unique words for each source. It has been arranged based on the number of words; because they determine the value of each source for corpus. It should be noted that the total number of \"unique words\" is not equal to the addition of the values in the column; because all repeated words between sources are excluded."

In or-\nder to have a general idea about the corpus in\nhand, in terms of size. Table four, shows the gen-\neral statistics of the corpus. It indicates that the\ncorpus has over five million articles from ten news\nsources. The total number of words exceeds 1.5\nbillion words, and the total number of unique\nwords exceeds 3.3 million words.\nThe KACST Corpus (Al-Thubaity, 2014), the\nlargest free corpus available, created by a team\nfrom King Abdulaziz City for Science and Tech-\nnology. They also outsourced 25% of the corpus\nto external specialists. It has 700 million words\nwith about 1.5 million articles. The Arabic Giga-\nWord corpus, which is the largest paid corpus\navailable, was created by an institution like the\nLDC over a period of over of ten years. It has 3.3\nmillion articles, and 1.077 billion words.\nReference\n1 Abbas, M., & Smaili, K. (2005). Comparison of topic identification methods for Arabic lan-\nguage.
