      "text" : "Related languages are those that exhibit lexical and structural similarities on account of sharing a common ancestry or being in prolonged contact for a long period of time (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). Common ancestry leads to languages being related via language family hierarchies (e.g Indo-Aryan, Slavic languages). Prolonged con-\ntact, on the other hand, leads to convergence of linguistic properties even if the languages are not related by ancestry and could lead to the formation of linguistic areas. Examples of such linguistic areas are the Indian subcontinent and Standard Average European linguistic areas. There is substantial government, commercial and cultural communication among people speaking related languages (Europe, India and South-East Asia being prominent examples and linguistic regions in Africa possibly in the future). As these regions integrate more closely and move to a digital society, translation between related languages is becoming an important requirement. In addition, translation to/from related languages to a lingua franca like English is also very important. However, in spite of communication between people speaking related languages, most of these languages have few parallel corpora resources. It is therefore important to leverage the relatedness of these languages to build good-quality statistical machine translation (SMT) systems given the lack of parallel corpora.\nModelling the lexical similarity among related languages is the key to building goodquality SMT systems with limited parallel corpora. Lexical similarity implies that the languages share many words with the similar form (spelling/pronunciation) and meaning e.g. blindness is andhapana in Hindi, aandhaLepaNaa in Marathi. These words could be cognates, lateral borrowings or loan words from other languages.\nSub-word level transformations are an effective way for translation of such shared words. In this work, we explore the learning of subword units using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a encoding method inspired from text compression literature, and use them as the basic translation unit. Generally, the basic units of translation are either linguistically\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n06 51\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 O\nct 2\n01 6\nmotivated (word, morpheme, syllable, etc.) or adhoc choices (character n-gram). BPE is motivated by statistical analysis of text and brings a new perspective to the investigation of basic units for translation among related languages.\nThe following are the major contributions of our work:\n• We show that BPE units outperform orthographic syllable units (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016), the best performing basic unit for translation between related languages, resulting in up to 11% improvement in translation accuracy. • Unlike orthographic syllables, BPE units are\nwriting system independent. Orthographic syllables can only be applied to alphabetic and abugida writing systems. We show BPE units improve translation over word and morpheme level models for languages using abjad and logographic writing systems. Average translation accuracy improvements of 18% and 6% over a baseline word-level model for language pairs involving abjad and logographic writing systems respectively were observed. • We have reported results over a large number\nof languages (16 language pairs and 17 languages) which span 4 major language families and 10 writing systems of various types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest experiment for translation over related languages and the broad coverage strongly supports our results. • We also show BPE units outperform other\ntranslation units in a cross-domain translation task. • We perform a detailed analysis studying the\nrelationship of translation accuracy with lexical similarity and conditional entropy of translation models to understand why BPE units perform better than other units.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Section 3 describes BPE. Section 4 describes the experimental setup. Section 5 reports the results of our experiments and provides observations and analyses of the results. Based on experimental results, we analyse why BPE units outperform other units in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper by summarizing the work and discussing further research possibilities."

      "heading" : "2 Related Work",
      "text" : "There are two broad set of approaches that have been explored in the literature for translation between related languages to leverage lexical similarity between source and target languages.\nThe first approach is to use transliteration of source words into the target languages. This can done by transliterating the untranslated words in a post-processing step (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012; Kunchukuttan et al., 2014), a technique generally used for handling named entities in SMT. The drawback is that transliteration candidates cannot be scored and tuned along with other features used in the SMT system. This limitation can be overcome by integrating the transliteration module into the decoder (Durrani et al., 2010), so both translation and transliteration candidates can be evaluated and scored. This also allows transliteration vs. translation choices to be made.\nSince there is a high degree of similarity at the sub-word level between related languages, the second approach looks at translation with subword level basic units. Character-level SMT has been explored for very closely related languages like Bulgarian-Macedonian, IndonesianMalay, Spanish-Catalan with modest success (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009a; Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013). Unigram-level learning provides very little context for learning translation models (Tiedemann, 2012). The use of character n-gram units to address this limitation leads to data sparsity for higher order n-grams and provides little benefit (Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013). These results were demonstrated primarily for very close European languages. Recently, Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya (2016) proposed orthographic syllables (OS), a linguistically-motivated variablelength unit. The OS consists of a consonant core with zero or more vowels (a CV+ combination). This unit has outperformed character ngram, word and morpheme level models as well as transliteration post-editing approaches mentioned earlier. They also showed orthographic syllables can outperform other units even when: (i) the lexical distance between related languages is reasonably large, (ii) the languages do not have a genetic relation, but only a contact relation.\nRecently, sub-word level models have also generated interest in the context of neural machine translation (NMT) systems. This has been motivated by the need to limit the vocabulary of neu-\nral MT systems in encoder-decoder architectures (Sutskever et al., 2014). It is in this context that Byte Pair Encoding, a data compression method (Gage, 1994), was adapted to learn sub-word units for NMT (Sennrich et al., 2016). Other subword units for NMT have also been proposed: character (Chung et al., 2016), Huffman encoding based units (Chitnis and DeNero, 2015), word pieces (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012; Wu et al., 2016). Our hypothesis is that such subword units learnt from corpora are particularly suited for translation between related languages. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by using BPE to learn subword units."

      "heading" : "3 Byte Pair Encoding as basic unit",
      "text" : "Byte Pair Encoding is a data compression algorithm which was first adapted for Neural Machine Translation by Sennrich et al. (2016) as a way to learn a limited vocabulary for near open vocabulary translation. The essential idea is identification of the most frequent character sequences to add to the initial vocabulary. The initial vocabulary consists of only the characters in the text. An iterative greedy algorithm is used to add a new vocabulary item in every iteration. In every iteration, the most frequent bigram (based on current vocabulary) in the monolingual corpus is added to the vocabulary (the merge operation). With the updated vocabulary, the text is again encoded and this process is repeated for a pre-determined number of merge\noperations. The number of merge operations is the only hyper-parameter to the system which needs to be tuned. Figure 1 shows a high-level pseudo-code of the training process. So a new word scion may be segmented as sc ion after applying the model, assuming sc and ion as BPE units learnt during training.\nWe used the same BPE algorithm as described above and learn the BPE encodings at the wordlevel. The only way we differ from Sennrich et al. (2016) is in terms of the representation of the encoded words in the corpus. They choose a representation where the last unit of a segmented word is marked by a special character (say ‘ ’), so sc ion would be represented as sc ion . Instead of marking the units of the words, we introduce special whitespace markers which indicate the gap between words. So, the sentence, ‘the scion came’ would be represented as ‘the sc ion came’. We choose this format for fair comparison with previous work on related languages."

      "text" : "Our experiments spanned a diverse set of languages: 16 language pairs, 17 languages and 10\nwriting systems. Table 1 summarizes the key aspects of the languages involved in the experiments.\nThe chosen languages span 4 major language families (6 major sub-groups: Indo-Aryan, Slavic and Germanic belong to the larger Indo-European language family). The languages exhibit a range of differences in word order and morphological complexity. The classification of Japanese and Korean into the Altaic family is debated, but various lexical and grammatical similarities are indisputable, either due to genetic or cognate relationship (Robbeets, 2005; Vovin, 2010). However, the source of lexical similarity is immaterial to the current work. For want of a better classification, we use the name Altaic to indicate relatedness between Japanese and Korean.\nThe chosen language pairs also exhibit varying levels of lexical similarity. Table 4 shows an indication of the lexical similarity between them in terms of the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) (Melamed, 1995) between the parallel training sentences at character level (shown only for language pairs where the writing systems are the same or can be easily mapped to do the LCSR computation). At one end of the spectrum, mayind, urd-hin, mac-bul are dialects/registers of the same language and exhibit high lexical similarity. On the other end of the spectrum, some language pairs like Hindi and Malayalam belong to different language families, but show many lexical and grammatical similarities due to contact for a long time (Subbarao, 2012).\nThe chosen languages cover 5 types of writing systems. Of these, alphabetic and abugida writing systems represent vowels, logographic writing\nLanguage Size Language Size\nhin (Bojar et al., 2014) 10M urd (Jawaid et al., 2014) 5M tam (Ramasamy et al., 2012) 1M mar (news websites) 1.8M mal (Quasthoff et al., 2006) 200K swe (OpenSubtitles2016) 2.4M mac (Tiedemann, 2009b) 680K ind (Tiedemann, 2009b) 640K\nTable 3: Details of additional Monolingual Corpora for word-level models (source and size in number of sentences)\nsystems do not have vowels. The use of vowels is optional in abjad writing systems and depends on various factors and conventions. For instance, Urdu word segmentation can be very inconsistent (Durrani and Hussain, 2010) and generally short vowels are not denoted. The Korean Hangul writing system is syllabic, so the vowels are implicitly represented in the characters."

(‡): For kor and jpn, the BPE results reported correspond to the best performing configuration in Table 5.\n• BPE units are clearly better than the traditional word and morpheme representations. The average BLEU score improvement is 15% over word-based results and 11% over morpheme-based results. The only exception is Malay-Indonesian, which are essentially registers of the same language.\n• BPE units also show significant improvement over the recently proposed orthographic syllable units over most language pairs (average improvement of 2.6% and maximum improvement of up to 11%). The only exceptions are ben-hin, pan-hin and may-ind - all these languages pairs have relatively less morphological affixing (pan-hin, ben-hin) or are registers of the same language (may-ind). For ban-hin and pan-hin, the BPE unit translation accuracies are quite close to that of the OS level. Since OS level models have been shown to be better than character level models, BPE units are better than character level models by transitivity.\n• It is worth mentioning that BPE units provide a substantial benefit over OS units when translation involves a morphologically rich language. In translations involving mal, tam and tel, average accuracy improvement of 6.25% were observed."

      "heading" : "5.2 Applicability to different writing systems",
      "text" : "The utility of orthographic syllables as translation units is limited to languages that use writing systems which represent vowels. Alphabetic and abugida writing systems fall into this category. On the other hand, logographic writing systems (Japanese Kanji, Chinese) and abjad writing systems (Arabic, Hebrew, Syriac, etc.) do not represent vowels. To be more precise, abjad writing systems may represent some/all vowels depending on language, pragmatics and conventions. Syllabic writing systems like Korean Hangul do not explicitly represent vowels, since the basic unit (the syllable) implicitly represents the vowels. The\nmajor advantage of Byte Pair Encoding is its writing system independence and our results show that BPE encoded units are useful for translation involving abjad (Urdu uses an extended Arabic writing system), logographic (Japanese Kanji) and syllabic (Korean Hangul) writing systems. For language pairs involving Urdu, there is an 18% average improvement over word-level and 12% average improvement over morpheme-level translation accuracy.

Selecting the optimal value of merge operations lead to a modest, average increase of 1.6% and maximum increase of 3.5% in the translation accuracy over Bmatch across different language pairs .\nWe also experimented with higher number of merge operations for some language pairs, but there seemed to be no benefit with a higher number of merge operations. Compared to the number\nof merge operations reported by Sennrich et al. (2016) in a more general setting for NMT (60k), the number of merge operations is far less for translation between related languages with limited parallel corpora. We must bear in mind that their goal was different: available parallel corpus was not an issue, but they wanted to handle as large a vocabulary as possible for open-vocabulary NMT. Yet, the low number of merge operations suggest that BPE encoding is suitable for this translation task."

The idea is to\nlearn an encoding that is consistent across source and target languages and therefore help alignment. If source and target use the same writing system, then a joint model is created by learning BPE over concatenated source and target language corpus. If the writing systems are different, then we transliterate one corpus to another by one-one character mappings. This is possible between Indic scripts. But this scheme cannot be applied between Urdu and Indic scripts as well as between Korean Hangul and Japanese Kanji scripts.\nTable 7 shows the results of the joint BPE model for language pairs where such a model is built. This performance of this model is roughly equivalent to the best performing monolingual BPE model."
    }, {
      "heading" : "6 Why is BPE unit better than other units?",
      "text" : "The improved performance of BPE units compared to word-level and morpheme-level representations is easy to explain: with a limited vocabulary they address the problem of data sparsity. But unigram level models also have a limited vocabulary, yet they do not improve translation performance except for very close languages. This is because, they can effectively earn character mappings which may be sufficient for transliteration to some extent. But translating cognates, morphological affixes, etc. require a larger context. So, BPE and OS units — which provide more context — outperform unigrams.\nTo understand why BPE performs better than OS, we need to understand an important desirable property of the segmentation scheme: the segmen-\ntation should lead to a model with a good predictive capacity (for instance in terms of language modeling). In fact, segmentation schemes like wordpieces (Schuster and Nakajima, 2012) explicity try to maximize this goal. By learning a compression model for the data, BPE is also implicitly learning a predictive model (Minimum Description Length Principle). One the other hand, the OS unit provides a larger context but there is no attempt to maximize the predictive capacity of the segmentation.\nTable 8 offers insights supporting these hypotheses. Unigram models work best when the source and target sentences are lexically very similar. The additional context decouples the OS and BPE units from lexical similarity. The translation models using BPE units are less correlated to the lexical similarity than OS level models since BPE learns a model of the corpus.\nAnother interesting observation is related to the conditional entropy model at the lexical/unit level (as opposed to the phrase/sequence level). The conditional entropy for the lexical translation model given the source language F and the target language E can be computed as: H(F |E) = − ∑ e∈VE P (e) ∑ f∈VF P (f |e) logP (f |e)\nwhere, VF and VE are the vocabularies of the source and target languages for the chosen unit of representation f and e are basic units in the vocabulary of F and E respectively P (e) is estimated using a 0th order language model over the target language corpus\nTable 9 shows the conditional entropy of lexical translation models for sub-word units over some\nlanguage pairs. It is seen that the translation entropy is lowest for unigram level model and highest for the BPE level model. This indicates that unigram character models are learning unambiguous character mappings, whereas the reality is that the mappings are quite ambiguous. The higher conditional entropy of OS and BPE unit models capture this reality."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion & Future Work",
      "text" : "We showed that the BPE unit, a translation unit motivated from data compression and information theory, can outperform all previously proposed translation units, including the best-performing orthographic syllables, for the task of translation between related languages when limited parallel corpus is available. Moreover, BPE encoding is writing system independent and hence can be applied to any language. Experimental results on a large number of language pairs spanning diverse language families and writing systems support the benefits of BPE encoding for this task. We also show that BPE units are more robust to change in translation domain and they perform better in extremely data scarce scenarios and for morphologically rich languages. Initial experiments to build joint BPE models across source and target language gave minor improvements.\nCompared to the application of BPE in NMT, only a small number of merge operations are required to learn an optimal vocabulary suggesting that BPE units are particularly suitable for translation between related languages. This also begs the question of connections between data compression and translation accuracy, an area of work which could be relevant to Neural MT also. NMT between related languages using BPE and similar encodings is also an obvious direction to explore. Given the improved performance of the BPE-unit and OS, tasks involving related languages viz. pivot based MT, domain adaptation (Tiedemann, 2012) and translation between a lingua franca and related languages (Wang et al., 2012) can be revisited with these basic units."

BPE identifies the most frequent character sequences as basic units, while orthographic syllables are linguistically motivated pseudo-syllables. We show that BPE units outperform orthographic syllables as units of translation, showing up to 11% increase in BLEU scores. In addition, BPE can be applied to any writing system, while orthographic syllables can be used only for languages whose writing systems use vowel representations. We show that BPE units outperform word and morpheme level units for translation involving languages like Urdu, Japanese whose writing systems do not use vowels (either completely or partially). Across many language pairs, spanning multiple language families and types of writing systems, we show that translation with BPE segments outperforms orthographic syllables, especially for morphologically rich languages.",
