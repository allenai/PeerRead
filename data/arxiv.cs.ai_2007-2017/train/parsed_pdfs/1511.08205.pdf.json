      "text" : "Graph search problems are about the search for a graph which satisfies a given set of constraints, or to determine that no such graph exists. Often graph search problems are about the search for the set of all graphs, modulo graph isomorphism, that satisfy the given constraints. Graph search problems are typically invariant under graph isomorphism. Namely, if G is a solution, then any graph obtained by permuting the vertices of G is also a solution. When seeking solutions, the size of the search space is significantly reduced if symmetries are eliminated. The search space can be explored more efficiently when avoiding paths that lead to symmetric solutions and avoiding also those that lead to symmetric non-solutions.\nOne common approach to eliminate symmetries is to introduce symmetry breaking constraints [24,11,28,29] which rule out isomorphic solutions thus reducing the size of the search space while preserving the set of solutions. Ideally, a symmetry breaking constraint is satisfied by a single member of each equivalence class of solutions, thus drastically restricting the search space. However, computing such symmetry breaking constraints is, most likely, intractable in general [11]. In practice, symmetry breaking constraints typically rule out some, but not all of the symmetries in the search and, as noted in the survey by Walsh [30], often a few simple constraints rule out most of the symmetries.\nShlyakhter [28] notes that the core difficulty is to identify a symmetrybreaking predicate which is both effective (rules out a large portion of the search\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n08 20\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nN ov\n2 01\nspace) and compact (so that checking the additional constraints does not slow down the search). In [10], Codish et al. introduce a symmetry breaking constraint for graph search problems. Their constraint is compact, with size polynomial in the number of graph vertices, and shown to be effective but it does not eliminate all of the symmetries in the search.\nThere is a large body of research that concerns identifying symmetries in a given graph. In this setting, finding symmetries is about detecting graph automorphisms. A typical application is in the context of SAT solving as described for example in [4,2,13,15,14]. In this paper the setting is different as the graph is not given but rather is the subject of the search problem.\nIn this paper we adopt the following terminology. Symmetry breaking constraints that break all of the symmetries, or more precisely, that guarantee that no two solutions are isomorphic (graphs), are called complete. Symmetry breaking constraints which are not complete are called partial. If a symmetry breaking constraint guarantees that solutions are canonical then it is called canonizing. Note that canonizing symmetry breaking constraints are also complete.\nComputing all solutions to a graph search problem with partial symmetry breaking constraints is a two step process. First one generates the set S of solutions to the constraints, and then one applies a graph isomorphism tool, such as nauty [18] to reduce S modulo isomorphism. Often, the number of solutions in the first step is very large and then this method may fail to generate the initial set of solutions.\nThis paper is about the computation of canonizing (complete) symmetry breaking constraints for “small” graph search problems. Consider for example the search for a graph with n = 10 vertices. The search space consists of 245 graphs, whereas, there are only 12 005 168 such graphs modulo isomorphism (see sequence A000088 of the OEIS [23]). In theory, to break all symmetries one could construct a symmetry breaking constraint that considers all 10! = 3,628,800 permutations of the vertices. We will show how to construct a compact canonizing (complete) symmetry breaking constraint for graph search problems on 10 vertices using only 7853 permutations.\nIn general, our first technique is, in the terminology of [3], “instance independent” and applies to break all symmetries in graph search problems on up to 10 vertices. We also consider, “instance dependent” canonizing symmetry breaking constraints which apply to break symmetries in larger graphs which are solutions of a given graph search problem. These are typically smaller and easier to compute. We illustrate the application of complete symmetry breaking constraints, both instance independent and instance dependent, to extend two known sequences from the OEIS related to graph enumeration.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a motivating example. Section 3 presents preliminary definitions and notation. Section 4 describes how we compute complete and canonizing symmetry breaking constraints for (instance independent) graph search problems. Then in Section 5 we show how to compute complete and canonizing symmetry breaking constraints for a given graph search problem. Section 7 concludes."

      "heading" : "2 A Motivating Example",
      "text" : "A classic example of a graph search problem relates to the search for Ramsey graphs [25]. The graph R(s, t;n) is a simple graph with n vertices, no clique of size s, and no independent set of size t. Figure 1 illustrates a R(3, 3; 5) graph. The graph contains no 3-clique and no 3-independent set. A Ramsey (s, t)-graph is a R(s, t;n) graph for some n. The set of all R(s, t;n) graphs, modulo graph isomorphism, is denoted R(s, t;n). Ramsey Theory tells us that there are only\na finite number of Ramsey (s, t)-graphs for each s and t, but finding all such graphs, or even determining the largest n for which they exist, is a famously difficult problem. It is unknown, for example, if there exists a R(5, 5; 43) graph and the set R(4, 5; 24) has yet to be been fully determined, although 350,904 nonisomorphic graphs are known to belong to R(4, 5; 24).\nSolving the graph search problem to find all R(3, 4; 8) graphs without any symmetry breaking constraint results in a set of 17,640 graphs. Applying nauty to these solutions identifies precisely 3 solutions modulo graph isomorphism. Introducing a partial symmetry breaking constraint as described in [9] in the search to enumerate all R(3, 4; 8) graphs computes only 11 graphs in a fraction of the time required to compute the full set of solutions. These too can then be reduced applying nauty to obtain the 3 canonical solutions. Application of a complete symmetry breaking constraint as proposed in this paper results in the exact set of 3 non-isomorphic solutions."

      "text" : "Throughout this paper we consider finite and simple graphs (undirected with no self loops). The set of simple graphs on n nodes is denoted Gn. We assume that the vertex set of a graph, G = (V,E), is V = {1, . . . , n} and represent G by its n× n adjacency matrix A defined by\nAi,j = { 1 if (i, j) ∈ E 0 otherwise\nAn n-vertices graph search problem is a pair (ϕ,A) consisting of an n × n matrix A of Boolean variables Ai,j ; and a propositional formula ϕ of the form\nϕ(A) = ϕnadj(A) ∧ ϕ′(A) (1)\nwhere ϕnadj(A) = ∧\n1≤i≤n (¬Ai,i)︸ ︷︷ ︸ (a)\n∧ ∧\n1≤i<j≤n (Ai,j ↔ Aj,i)︸ ︷︷ ︸ (b)\n(2)\nand where ϕ′(A) is a formula on the variables in A (perhaps involving also other variables). In Constraint (2), the left part (a) states that there are no self loops and the right part (b) states that the edges are undirected. Note that any satisfying assignment of ϕ(A) renders an instance of A which represents a simple graph which we call a solution of (ϕ,A). The set of solutions is denoted sol(ϕ,A). The following presents two example graph search problems which we will refer to in rest of the paper.\nExample 1. The Ramsey graph R(s, t;n) is a simple graph with n vertices, no clique of size s, and no independent set of size t. The set of all R(s, t;n) graphs, modulo graph isomorphism, is denoted R(s, t;n). The search for a Ramsey graph is a graph search problem where we take the following ϕR(s,t;n) instead of ϕ\n′ in Constraint (1). Here we denote by ℘s[n] (respectively ℘t[n]) the set of subsets of size s (respectively t) of { 1, . . . , n } . The left conjunct (a) states that there is no clique of size s in the graph, and the right conjunct (b) that there is no independent set of size t.\nϕ(s,t;n)(A) = ∧\nI∈℘s[n]\n∨{ ¬Ai,j ∣∣∣∣ i, j ∈ I,i < j }\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ (a)\n∧ ∧\nI∈℘t[n]\n∨{ Ai,j ∣∣∣∣ i, j ∈ I,i < j }\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ (b)\n(3)\nExample 2. A graph is claw-free if it does not contain the complete bipartite graph K1,3 (sometimes called a “claw”) as a subgraph. The claw free graph search problem is formalized by taking the following ϕcf (n) instead of ϕ\n′ in Constraint (1). Each clause in the conjunction expresses for i, j, k, ` that there is no subgraph K1,3 between {i} and {j, k, `}.\nϕcf (n)(A) = ∧{ ¬Ai,j ∨ ¬Ai,k ∨ ¬Ai,`\n∨Aj,k ∨Ak,` ∨ ∨Aj,` ∣∣∣∣1 ≤ i ≤ n, i 6= j, i 6= k,i 6= `, 1 ≤ j < k < ` ≤ n }\n(4)\nThe set of permutations π : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n} is denoted Sn. For G = (V,E) ∈ Gn and π ∈ Sn, we define π(G) = {V, {(π(u), π(v))|(u, v) ∈ E)}. Permutations act on adjacency matrices in the natural way: If A is the adjacency matrix of a graph G, then π(A) is the adjacency matrix of π(G) obtained by simultaneously permuting with π the rows and columns of A. We adopt the tuple notation [π(1), . . . , π(n)] for a permutation π : {1, . . . , n} → {1, . . . , n}.\nTwo graphs G1, G2 ∈ Gn are isomorphic, denoted G1 ≈ G2, if there exists a permutation π ∈ Sn such that G1 = π(G2). Sometimes we write G1 ≈π G2 to emphasize that π is the permutation such that G1 = π(G2). For sets of graphs H1, H2, we say that H1 ≈ H2 if for every G1 ∈ H1 (likewise in H2) there exists G2 ∈ H2 (likewise in H1) such that G1 ≈ G2.\nWe consider an ordering on graphs, defined viewing their adjacency matrices as strings. Because adjacency matrices are symmetric with zeroes on the diagonal, it suffices to focus on the upper triangle parts of the matrices [8].\nDefinition 1 (ordering graphs). Let G1, G2 ∈ Gn and let s1, s2 be the strings obtained by concatenating the rows of the upper triangular parts of their adjacency matrices respectively. Then, G1 G2 if and only if s1 lex s2. We also write A1 A2 where A1, A2 are the respective adjacency matrices of G1, G2.\nOne way to define the canonical representation of a graph is to take the smallest graph in the lexicographic order (i.e lex leader) in each equivalence class of isomorphic graphs [26]. In this paper we follow this definition for canonicity.\nDefinition 2 (canonicity). Let G ∈ Gn be a graph, Π ⊆ Sn, and denote the predicate minΠ(G) = ∧{ G π(G) ∣∣π ∈ Π }. We say that G is canonical if minSn(G). We say that Π is canonizing if ∀G∈Gn .minΠ(G)↔ minSn(G).\nObserve that in Definitions 1 and 2, the order is defined on given graphs. Often, we consider the same relation, but between adjacency matrices that contain propositional variables (representing unknown graphs, as in the case for graph search problems). Then, the expressions A1 A2 and minΠ(A) are viewed as a Boolean constraints on the variables in the corresponding matrices.\nExample 3. Let Π = { [2, 1, 3, 4], [1, 3, 2, 4], [1, 2, 4, 3] }\n. The interested reader can verify that Π is canonizing for G4. Note that with only three permutations we express the information present in 4! = 24.\nDefinition 3 (symmetry break). Let (ϕ,A) be a graph search problem and ψ a propositional formula on the variables in A. We say that ψ is a symmetry break for (ϕ,A) if sol(ϕ,A) ≈ sol(ϕ ∧ ψ,A). If the graphs of sol(ϕ ∧ ψ,A) are mutually non-isomorphic then we say that ψ is complete. Otherwise we say that ψ is partial. If the graphs of sol(ϕ ∧ ψ,A) are canonical then we say that ψ is canonizing.\nLemma 1. Let Π be a canonizing set of permutations for graphs of size n. Then minΠ is a canonizing symmetry break for any graph search problem on n vertices.\nProof. Let A be a solution to a graph search problem on n vertices and let Π be a canonizing set for graphs with n vertices. In order to prove that minΠ is a canonizing symmetry break it is sufficient to show that only the canonical member in iso(A) = {π(A)|∀π ∈ Sn} satisfies minΠ . Π is a canonizing set thus by definition ∀G ∈ Gn : minΠ(G)↔ minSn(G). Since only the canonical graph in iso(A) satisfies minSn it follows that it is the only one which satisfies minΠ .\nCorollary 1. minSn(A) is a canonizing symmetry break for any graph search problem on n vertices.\nExample 4. Consider the canonizing set Π from Example 3 and the following 4× 4 adjacency matrix A:\nA =  0 a b c a 0 d e b d 0 f\nc e f 0\n Π =  [2, 1, 3, 4],[1, 3, 2, 4],\n[1, 2, 4, 3]\n"

In [9], Codish et al. introduce the following symmetry break for graph search problems where Ai denotes the i th row of the adjacency matrix A and {i,j} denotes the lexicographic comparison on strings after removing their ith and jth elements.\nDefinition 4 (lexicographic symmetry break, [9]).

In this paper all computations are performed using the Glucose 4.0 SAT solver [5]. Encodings to CNF are obtained using the finite-domain constraint compiler BEE [22]. BEE facilitates applications to find a single (first) solution, or to find all solutions for a constraint, modulo a specified set of variables. When solving for all solutions, BEE iterates with the SAT solver, adding so called blocking clauses each time another solution is found. This technique, originally due to McMillan [21], is simplistic but suffices for our purposes. All computations were performed on a cluster with a total of 228 Intel E8400 cores clocked at 2 GHz each, able to run a total of 456 parallel threads. Each of the cores in the cluster has computational power comparable to a core on a standard desktop computer. Each SAT instance is run on a single thread."

Applying this approach we compute relatively small canonizing sets which apply for graph search problems with up to 10 vertices.

Then, incrementally apply the step specified in lines 3–4 of Algorithm 1, as long as the stated condition holds.\nAlgorithm 1 Compute Canonizing Set\n1: procedure Compute-Canonizing-Set(n) 2: Init: Π = ∅ 3: while ∃G ∈ Gn ∃π ∈ Sn such that minΠ(G) and π(G) ≺ G do 4: Π = Π ∪ {π} 5: end while 6: return Π 7: end procedure\nLemma 2. Algorithm 1 terminates and returns a canonizing set Π.\nProof. Each step in the algorithm adds a permutation (at Line 4) and the number of permutations is bound. When the algorithm terminates with Π then for G ∈ Gn, if minΠ(G) holds then there is no π ∈ Sn such that π(G) ≺ G. So, G π(G) for all π ∈ Sn and therefore minSn(G) holds.\nDrawing on the discussion in [16,6,11] we do not expect to find a polynomial time algorithm to compute a canonical (or any other complete) symmetry breaking constraint for graph search problems based on Definition 2. Thus it is also unlikely to find an efficient implementation of Algorithm 1. Our implementation of Algorithm 1 is based on a SAT encoding. We repeatedly apply a SAT solver to find a counter example permutation which shows that Π is not a canonizing set yet and add it to Π, until an UNSAT result is obtained. In the implementation\nof the algorithm, care is taken to use a single invocation of the SAT solver so that the iterated calls to the solver are incremental. The constraint model used is depicted as Figure 2 where A,B denote n×n matrices of propositional variables and π denotes a length n vector of integer variables. Constraint 5 specifies that the parameter π is a permutation on { 1, . . . , n } . Each element of the vector is a value 1 ≤ πi ≤ n and the elements are all different. Constraint 6 specifies that the parameters A,B represent isomorphic graphs via the parameter π. Constraint 7 specifies the condition of the while loop (line 3) of Algorithm 1: A and B are constrained B = π(A) to be isomorphic adjacency matrices (see Constraint (2)) via the permutation π. The constraint minΠ(A) is imposed and also A B. If ϕnalg1 (Π) is satisfiable, then the permutation π is determined by the satisfying assignment and added to Π as specified in (line 4) of Algorithm 1.\nWe say that a canonizing set Π of permutations is redundant if for some π ∈ Π the set Π \\{π} is also canonizing. Algorithm 1 may compute a redundant set. For example, if a permutation added at some point becomes redundant in view of permutations added later. Algorithm 2 iterates on the elements of a canonizing set to remove redundant permutations.\nAlgorithm 2 Reduce method\n1: procedure Reduce(Π) 2: for each π ∈ Π do 3: if ∀G ∈ Gn: minΠ\\{π}(G) ⇒ G π(G) then 4: Π = Π \\ {π} 5: end if 6: end for 7: return Π 8: end procedure\nLemma 3. If Π is canonizing, then so is Reduce(Π) computed by Algorithm 2.\nProof. Let Πi be the set obtained after considering the i th permutation in Line 2 of Algorithm 2. The initial set Π0 is the input to the algorithm. We prove that minΠi ↔ minΠi+1 and conclude that minΠ ↔ minReduce(Π). If no permutation was removed in step i then Πi+1 = Πi and trivially minΠi ↔ minΠi+1 . Otherwise Πi+1 = Πi \\ {π} for a permutation π which satisfies ∀G ∈ Gn: minΠi+1(G) ⇒ G π(G). Thus π is implied by the permutations in Πi and can be removed. Therefore minΠi+1(G)↔ minΠi(G).\nOur implementation of Algorithm 2 is based on SAT encoding. The key is in the encoding for the test in Line 3. Here, for the given Π and π ∈ Π, we encode the constraint\nϕnalg2 (Π) = ϕ n adj(A)︸ ︷︷ ︸ (a) ∧ minΠ\\{π}(A) ∧ π(A) A︸ ︷︷ ︸ (b)\n(8)\nwhere the left part (a) specifies that A is the n × n adjacency matrix of some graph (see Constraint (2)), and the right part (b) is the negation of the condition in Line 3. If this constraint is unsatisfiable then π is redundant and removed from Π.\nTable 1 describes the computation of irredundant canonizing sets of permutations for n ≤ 10 by application of Algorithms 1 and 2. The first three columns indicate the number of graph vertices, n, the number of permutations on n, and the number of non-isomorphic graphs on n vertices as specified by sequence A000088 of the OEIS [23]. The forth and fifth columns indicate the size of the canonical set of permutations computed using Algorithm 1 and the time to perform this computation. Columns six and seven are the size of the reduced canonical set of permutations after application of Algorithm 2 and the corresponding computation time. Column seven is set in boldface. These numbers present the relatively small size of the computed canonizing sets in comparison to the value of n!. Using the symmetry breaks derived from these sets we have generated the sets of all non-isomorphic graphs with up to 10 vertices and verified that their numbers correspond to those in column 3. These are computed by solving Constraint (1) taking ϕ′ ≡ true.\nThe numbers in Table 1 also indicate the limitation of complete symmetry breaks which apply to all graphs. We do not expect to succeed to compute a canonizing set of permutations for n = 11 and even if we did succeed, we expect that the number of constraints that would then need be added in applications would be too large to be effective."

Note that we succeed to compute canonizing symmetry breaks for more than 20 nodes. We have not included the results in Table 4 as the subsequent graph enumeration problems involve a humongous number of graphs. For 20 nodes the results are incomplete. For each of the 151 degree sequences we perform a separate enumeration of the corresponding highly irregular graphs (on one thread of the cluster). From these, 147 sub-enumerations have completed with aggregated time of 3 431.61 hours. The four remain cases are still running."

      "text" : "Isomorphism free generation of combinatorial objects and particularly graphs, is a well studied topic [26,12,27,7,19]. Methods that generate the canonical repre-\nsentatives of each equivalence class are sometimes classified as “orderly” generation methods. This is a dynamic approach. Typically graphs are constructed by adding edges in iteration until a solution is found and backtracking when failing. In each such iteration the graph is checked to determine whether it can still be further extended: (a) to a solution of the graph search problem, and (b) to a canonical graph. Both of these tests consider only the fixed part of the partial graph. Initially, there are very few permutations that need to be considered for (b) as the partial graph is still small. However, as the number of edges grows this test becomes harder and consumes more time.\nOur method is in contrast static. We aim to compute, before applying search, a small set of permutations that apply to break the symmetries in solutions. Our approach does not rely on which parts of the graph have already been determined during search."

      "text" : "We have illustrated the applicability of canonizing symmetry breaking constraints for small graph search problems. Although any vertex permutation is potentially a symmetry, we compute compact canonizing symmetry breaks, much smaller than those which consider all permutations. Our strategy for graph search problems is two phase. First, symmetry breaking constraints are computed. Second, these constraints are added to the model and then a solver is applied to find (all) solutions which satisfy the model.\nWe have presented methods that generate both instance independent and instance dependent symmetry breaking constraints. While instance dependent symmetry breaks have limited applicability since they grow enormously for graphs with more than 10 vertices, instance dependent symmetry breaks have been successfully applied to compute new values in highly irregular graphs OEIS sequence for graphs with up to 19 vertices.\nAlthough our approach is applicable only for graphs with small numbers of vertices, there are many open small graph search problems. For example the set\nof all Ramsey R(4, 5; 24) graphs has not been determined yet. We are currently trying to extend our techniques to apply to compute symmetry breaks for this problem which involves only 24 vertices.\nFinally, we note that our approach will also apply to improve dynamic symmetry breaking techniques. Given a partially instantiated graph, to determine if it is extendable to a canonical graph, one need not consider all of the permutations related to the already instantiated part. This because some of those permutations are redundant."

Such problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of their solutions. This paper introduces effective and compact, complete symmetry breaking constraints for small graph search. Enumerating with these symmetry breaks generates all and only non-isomorphic solutions. For small search problems, with up to 10 vertices, we compute instance independent symmetry breaking constraints. For small search problems with a larger number of vertices we demonstrate the computation of instance dependent constraints which are complete. We illustrate the application of complete symmetry breaking constraints to extend two known sequences from the OEIS related to graph enumeration.",
