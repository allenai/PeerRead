      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Human motion analysis (HMA) refers to the analysis and interpretation of human movements over time. For decades, it has been a popular research topic that crossovers many domains such as biology [1, 2], psychology [3, 4], multimedia [5] and so on. In the computer vision domain, HMA has been emerging actively over the years due to the advancement of video camera technologies and the availability of more sophisticated computer vision algorithms in the public domain. Here, the HMA concerns the detection, tracking and recognition of human, and more generally the understanding of human behaviors, from image sequences involving humans. Amongst all, video surveillance is one of the most important real-time applications [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1, the Madrid, London and Boston marathon bombing tragedies, happened in 2004, 2005 and 2013 respectively, would not have been worse if an intelligent video surveillance system that capable of automatically detecting abnormal human behavior was installed in the public areas. Apart from that, HMA also contributed in video retrieval [11], sports analysis [12, 13, 14], healthcare monitoring [15, 16], human-computer interaction [17] and so on.\nThe importance and popularity of the HMA system has led to several surveys in the literature, as indicated in Table 1. One of the earliest surveys was [18], focused on various methods employed in the analysis of the human body motion, which is in non-rigid form. [19] gave an overview on the motion extraction methods using the motion capture systems and focused on action recognition, individual body parts recognition, and body configuration estimation. [20] used the same taxonomy as in [19], but engaging different labels for the three classes, that is further dividing the classes into subclasses yielding a more comprehensive taxonomy. [21] gave an overview on the applications of visual analysis of human movements, and their taxonomy covered the 2D and 3D approaches with and without the explicit shape models.\nAs the works in this area prosper, public datasets start to gain importance in the vision community to meet different research challenges. The KTH [38] and the Weizmann [39, 40] datasets were the most popular human actions\n*Chern Hong Lim and Ekta Vats contributed equally to this paper. **Corresponding author.\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier December 3, 2014\ndatasets introduced in the early stages. However, neither of the datasets represent the human actions in a real world environment. In general, each action is performed in a simple manner with just a single actor, static background and fixed view point. KTH however considered a few complex situations such as different lighting conditions, but it is still far away from the real world complex scenarios. Therefore, other datasets were created such as the CAVIAR, ETISEO, CASIA Action, MSR Action, HOLLYWOOD, UCF datasets, Olympic Sports and HMDB51, BEHAVE, TV Human Interaction, UT-Tower, UT-Interaction, etc. Please refer to [37] for a complete list of the currently available datasets in HMA.\nDue to the advancement of the technology, using networks of multiple cameras for monitoring public places such as airports, shopping malls, etc. were emerged. [7, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33] moved ahead to survey on the representation and recognition of the human actions in multiple-views aspect. Various new datasets were created exclusively for this purpose such as the IXMAS, i3DPost, MuHAVi, VideoWeb and CASIA Action. Last but not the least, [7, 21, 23, 24, 27, 31, 36] surveyed on the various applications of HMA such as the smart surveillance and advanced user interface for human-computer interaction. For the convenience of the readers, we summarize in Table 1 and 2 the available survey papers and their respective focuses."

      "text" : "Fuzzy set theory since its inception in 1965, has played an important role in a variety of applications, for example the subway system in Sendai, Japan; washing machine; digital camera and so on. The research works on the fuzzy set theory in real world problems are abounded. In this paper, we will focus primarily on the solutions that utilize the fuzzy approaches towards HMA. Particularly, our main aim and contribution is to review the early years of the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. This is in contrast to the past surveys as listed in Table 1 and 2 where stochastic solutions were the predominant discussions.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the literature that has discussed and reviewed the fuzzy approaches towards HMA. The nearest studies to ours are [41, 42, 43]. [41] was the earliest survey that discussed the uncertainties in computer vision using the fuzzy sets. Specifically, it addressed the uncertainty in three levels: image segmentation, edge detection and shape representation. Later, [42] gave a broad overview of the fuzzy set theory towards computer vision with applications in the areas of image modeling, preprocessing, segmentation, boundary detection, object/region recognition, and rule-based scene interpretation. The involved tasks were noise removal, smoothing, and sharpening of the contrast (low-level vision); segmentation of images to isolate the objects and the regions followed by the description and recognition of the segmented regions (intermediate-level vision); and finally the interpretation of the scene (high-level vision). Finally, [43] addressed various aspects of image processing and analysis problems where the theory of fuzzy set was applied.\nFor ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA, as depicted in Figure 2. The LoL HMA is the background/foreground subtraction which contributes in the pre-processing of the raw images to discover the areas of interest such as the human region. MiL HMA is the object tracking. In this level, it serves as the means to prepare data for pose estimation and activity recognition. HiL HMA is the behavior understanding where the objective is to correctly classify the human motion patterns into activity categories; for example, walking, running, wave hands and so on.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the works on LoL HMA including the motion segmentation and the moving object classification. Section 3 covers the MiL HMA in terms of model-based and non-model based human tracking. The paper then extends the discussion to the HiL HMA that recognizes the human behavior in the image sequences in Section 4. Section 5 provides a detailed discussion on some advantages of the fuzzy approaches and presents some possible directions for the future research at length. Section 6 concludes the paper."

This process usually involves first of all, the motion segmentation, and followed by the object classification."

      "text" : "Motion segmentation aims at separating the moving objects from the natural scenes. The extracted motion regions are vital for the next level of processing, e.g. it relaxes the tracking complexity as only the pixels with changes are considered in the process. However, some critical situations in the real world environment such as the illumination\nchanges, dynamic scene movements (e.g. rainy weather, waving tree, rippling water and so on), camera jittering, and shadow effects make it a daunting task. In this section, we will mainly review fuzzy approaches that had addressed the background subtraction problems.\nBackground subtraction is one of the popular motion segmentation algorithms that has received much attention in the HMA system. This is due to the usefulness of its output that is capable of preserving the shape information, as well as helps in extracting motion and contour information [44, 45, 46]. In general, background subtraction is to differentiate between the image regions which have significantly different characteristics from the background image (normally denoted as the background model). A good background subtraction algorithm comprises of a background model that is robust to the environmental changes, but sensitive to identify all the moving objects of interest. There are some fuzzy approaches that endowed this capability in the background subtraction which will be discussed as follows."

      "text" : "Information fusion from a variety of sources is the most straightforward and effective approach to increase the classification confidence, as well as removing the ambiguity and resolving the conflicts in different decisions. Rationally in background modeling, the combination of several measuring criteria (also known as the features or attributes) can strengthen the pixel’s classification as background or foreground. However the basic mathematical operators used for aggregation such as the minimum, maximum, average, median, ‘AND’, and ‘OR’ operators provide crisp decisions and utilize only a single feature that tends to result in false positive [47]. In contrast, the fuzzy integrals take into account the importance of the coalition of any subset of the criteria [48].\nIn general, the fuzzy integral is a non-linear function that is defined with respect to the fuzzy measure such as a belief or a plausibility measure [49], and is employed in the aggregation step. As the fuzzy measure in the fuzzy integral is defined on a set of criteria, it provides precious information about the importance and relevance of the criteria to the discriminative classes. Thus it achieves feature selection with better classification results. [47] proposed to use the Sugeno integral [50] to fuse color and texture features in their works for better classification of the pixel that\nbelongs to either background or foreground, while [48, 51, 52] improved [47] by replacing the Sugeno integral with the Choquet integral [53]. The main reason is that the Choquet integral which was adapted for cardinal aggregation, was found to be more suitable than the Sugeno integral that assumed the measurement scale to be ordinal [54, 55]. The corresponding results for the comparison between the Sugeno integral and the Choquet integral are shown in Figure 3. The background modeling process using the fusion of color and texture features have shown to achieve better detection of the moving targets against cluttered backgrounds, backgrounds with little movements, shadow effects as well as illumination changes."

      "text" : "The studies on the background subtraction [56, 57] have shown that the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is one of the popular approaches used in modeling the dynamic background scene. It solves the limitation in the unimodal model (single Gaussian) which is unable to handle the dynamic backgrounds such as waving tree and water rippling. The expectation-maximization algorithm is normally used in the initialization step of the GMM to estimate the parameters from a training sequence using the Maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion. However, due to insufficient or noisy training data, the GMM may not be able to accurately reflect the underlying distribution of the observations. This is because exact numbers must be used in the likelihood computation and unfortunately, these parameters are bounded by uncertainty. In order to take into account the uncertainty, the fuzzy set theory was explored.\nHowever, there has been an argument that type-1 fuzzy set, which is an ordinary fuzzy set [59], has limited capability in modeling the uncertainty. This is because the membership function for the type-1 fuzzy set is not associated with uncertainty. Therefore, type-2 fuzzy sets [60] emerged from the type-1 fuzzy set by generalizing it to handle more uncertainty in the underlying fuzzy membership function. As a whole, the type-2 fuzzy membership function is itself a fuzzy set and referring to Figure 4, it can be noticed that the uncertainty in the fuzzy membership function is represented in the shaded area known as the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU). With the capability of type-2 fuzzy set to handle higher dimensions of uncertainty, it was adopted in [58] to represent the multivariate Gaussian with an uncertain mean vector or a covariance matrix. In more detail, it was assumed that the mean and the standard deviation vary within the intervals with uniform possibilities (Figure 4), instead of crisp values as in the conventional GMM.\nSeveral works [61, 62, 63] have been reported that utilized the type-2 fuzzy GMM to deal with insufficient or noisy data, and resulted in better background subtraction model. In the later stage, [64] made an improvement on these works with the inclusion of spatial-temporal constraints into the type-2 fuzzy GMM by using the Markov Random Field."

      "heading" : "2.1.3. Hybrid technique",
      "text" : "Although the fuzzy approaches provide superior performance in background subtraction, most of these approaches have a common problem, that is how to optimize the parameters in their algorithms. These parameters can be the intrinsic parameters such as the interval values of the membership function, or the threshold value for the inference step. Optimizing these parameters usually increases the overall system performance. However, such steps require human intervention [47, 51, 48]. For example, the trial and error process to determine a classification threshold value is a tedious job, computationally expensive and subjective [65].\nFortunately, such limitations can be handled by using hybrid techniques, i.e. the combination of fuzzy approaches with machine learning methods. [66] applied neural fuzzy framework to estimate the image motion. The backpropagation learning rule from a five-layered neural fuzzy network was used to choose the best membership functions so that the system is able to adapt to different environments involving occlusions, specularity, shadowing, transparency and so on. Besides that, [67] introduced a spatial coherence variant incorporated with the self-organizing neural network to formulate a fuzzy model to enhance the robustness against false detection in the background subtraction algorithm. [68] used both the particle swarm optimization and the kernel least mean square to update the system parameters of a fuzzy model, and [69] employed a tuning process using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm within a fuzzy system to fine-tune the membership function. In order to determine the appropriate threshold value for the classification task, [70] proposed a novel fuzzy-cellular method that helps in dynamically learning the optimal threshold value."

      "heading" : "2.2.1. Type-1 fuzzy inference system",
      "text" : "The Type-1 Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) [72] is a complete fuzzy decision making system that utilizes the fuzzy set theory. It has been successfully applied in numerous applications for commercial and research purposes. Its popularity is due to the capability to model the uncertainty and the sophisticated inference mechanism that greatly compromises the vague, noisy, missing, and ill-defined data in the data acquisition step. Figure 5 shows the overall\nframework of a typical Type-1 FIS, where it includes three important steps: fuzzification, inference, and defuzzification. The fuzzification step maps the crisp input data from a set of sensors (features or attributes) to the membership functions to generate the fuzzy input sets with linguistic support [73]. Then, the fuzzy input sets go through the inference steps with the support from a set of fuzzy rules to infer the fuzzy output sets. Finally, the fuzzy output sets are defuzzified into the crisp outputs.\nIn human detection, the FIS is an effective and direct approach to distinguish between the human and non-human with different features [75, 74, 76]. As an example, [74] extracted three features from the contours of the segmented region, such as the distance to the centroid, angle, and cord to arc ratio, and input them into the FIS. The corresponding fuzzy membership function and a set of fuzzy rules were used to infer the fuzzy output as depicted in Figure 6. The fuzzy outputs (VL, L, M, H, VH) were then defuzzified into the crisp outputs, and used to perform human classification. For example, if the crisp output is found to be less than the threshold value, then it is recognized as a human and vice versa.\nBesides that, [77, 78] studied in depth about the problems encountered in the human classification tasks, such as the situations where the unintended objects are attached to the classified human region. This problem often occurs in the silhouette based classification output. In general, silhouette is the binary representation of the segmented regions from the background subtraction techniques, where in HMA, human silhouette has proved its sufficiency to describe the activities captured by the video [44, 45, 46]. For example. a chair that is being moved by a person can be misclassified as a part of the segmented region, and included as part of the silhouette image. In order to solve this, [77, 78] applied the FIS to perform an adaptive silhouette extraction in the complex and dynamic environments. In their works, they used multiple features such as the sum of absolute difference (SAD), fraction of neighbor blocks, and distance between blocks and human body centroid. A set of fuzzy rules were generated, for instance, “IF SAD is SMALL, AND the fraction of neighboring silhouette blocks belong to the human body is LARGE, AND the distance from the centroid is SMALL, THEN the new block is more likely to be a human silhouette block”. Depending upon the application, the FIS is capable of modeling different sources of features by generating the appropriate fuzzy membership functions and the fuzzy rules."

      "text" : "To a certain extent, the overall performance of the system from [77, 78] may be degraded due to the misclassification of the objects in the proposed type-1 FIS. Taking this into account, [79] employed the interval type-2 FIS [80] which is capable of handling higher uncertainty levels present in the real world dynamic environments.\nIn general, as aforementioned, the type-2 FIS differs from the type-1 FIS in terms of the type-2 FIS offers the capability to support higher dimensions of uncertainty. The main focus in the type-2 FIS is the membership function that is used to represent the input data, where the membership function itself is a fuzzy set with FOU bounded in an ordinary membership function. In consequences, the input data is first fuzzified into type-2 input fuzzy sets, and then go through the inference process where the rules can be similar as the type-1 FIS. Before the defuzzification step takes place, the type-2 output fuzzy sets must be reduced from type-2 to type-1 output fuzzy set. This is processed by using a type-reducer, as depicted in Figure 7.\nUsing the same features as [77, 78], [79] proposed to fuzzify the input feature values into the type-2 fuzzy sets using the singleton fuzzification method [81]. Consequently, it produces the interval type-2 membership functions for the inference process. Their approach was tested on a set of images captured from the real world environment that contains single person, multi-person and the crowded scenes, respectively. The ground truth data was captured from the cameras deployed around their laboratory (i.e. a smart living room) to analyze people’s regular activities. Their proposed work showed that the type-2 FIS provides much better results as compared to the type-1 FIS (Figure 8). For ease of understanding of the readers, the problems of the works in LoL HMA with the intuition of using fuzzy approaches as the resolution are summarized in Table 3."

Readers can refer to [20, 21, 24, 92] for the detailed reviews. The stick figure model represents the human body as a combination of sticks or line segments connected by the joints [82, 83, 84, 85], while the 2D models represents the human body using 2D ribbons or blobs [83, 86, 87]. 3D models are used to depict the human body structure in a more detailed manner using cones, cylinders, spheres, ellipses etc. [88, 89, 90, 91].\nHowever, tracking human in video sequences is not an easy task. The human body has a complex non-rigid structure consisting of a number of joints (e.g. the leg is connected to the foot by the ankle joint) and each body part can therefore move in a high degree of freedom around its corresponding joints. This often results in self-occlusions of the body parts. 3D models are able to handle such scenarios, but there are other factors that can affect the tracking performance such as the monotone clothes, cluttered background and changing brightness [93]. Therefore, the fuzzy approaches such as the fuzzy qualitative kinematics, the fuzzy voxel person, and the fuzzy shape estimation are explored in the model based human motion tracking algorithms to handle the uncertainties."

[94] demonstrated a comprehensive visual motion estimation technique using the kinematic chain in a complex video sequence, as depicted in Figure 9. However, the crisp representation of the kinematic chain has a limitation. It suffers from the precision problem [95] and the cumulative errors can directly affect the performance of the higher level tasks. Therefore, a better strategy is required to model the kinematic chain, and to this end, the fuzzy qualitative kinematics has been proposed.\nTo begin with, the fuzzy qualitative reasoning [97, 98] is a form of approximate reasoning that can be defined as the fusion between the fuzzy set theory [59] and the qualitative reasoning [99]. The qualitative reasoning operates with the symbolic ‘quantities’, while the fuzzy reasoning reasons with the fuzzy intervals of varying precisions, providing a means to handle the uncertainty in a natural way. Therefore, the fuzzy qualitative reasoning incorporates the advantages of both the approaches to alleviate the hard boundary or the crisp values of the ordinary measurement\nspace. For instance, [100] applied this in the Fuzzy Qualitative Trigonometry (Figure 10) where the ordinary Cartesian space and the unit circle are substituted with the combination of membership functions yielding the fuzzy qualitative coordinate and the fuzzy qualitative unit circle. Extension from this, a fuzzy qualitative representation of the robot kinematics [95, 101] was proposed. The work presented a derivative extension to the Fuzzy Qualitative Trigonometry [100]. Motivated by these approaches, [102] proposed a data quantization process based on the Fuzzy Qualitative Trigonometry to model the uncertainties during the kinematic chain tracking process; and subsequently constructed a generic activity representation model."

      "text" : "As aforementioned, the 3D models provide more useful information than the 2D models as the features (height, centroid, orientation, etc.) in the 3D space are camera-view independent. Inspired by this, [16, 104] demonstrated a method to construct a 3D human model in voxel (volume element) space using the human silhouette images called the voxel person (Figure 11). However, due to the location of the cameras and the object’s positions, the gathered information using the crisp voxel person model can be sometimes imprecise and inaccurate. The crisp technique works well if and only if there are sufficient number of cameras. But unfortunately, it is hard to find more than a couple of cameras in the same area due to the high cost involved and the limited space area.\nTherefore, fuzzy voxel person was utilized in [103] by employing only a few cameras and a minimal prior knowledge about the object. The FIS was used to determine the membership degree of the voxel person, reflecting how likely it belongs to the actual object. Extreme body joints viewing conditions were taken into account and it was observed that the fuzzy acquired results were much better than the crisp approach, both qualitatively (as shown in Figure 12) as well as quantitatively [103]. This concept of the fuzzy voxel person was incorporated in a number of works [16, 104]."

Here, we will concentrate mainly on the blob representation. For a tracking system with reliance on the shape estimation, problems arise due to imperfect image segmentation techniques. This is because of the image irregularities, shadows, occlusions, etc. that results in multiple blobs generation for a single object. Besides that, in the multiple objects tracking, recovering from the overlapping regions is a big challenge. In order to solve this, [105, 106] applied FIS to update both the trajectories and the shape estimated for the targets with a set of image regions. These image regions are represented using the blobs extracted from each frame. Following the general steps of the FIS, heuristic\nfeatures were extracted from the detected blobs, and used as inputs to the FIS to assess the confidence values assigned to each blob to update the estimators describing the targets’ shape and the tracks. With this, the tracking can be locked if the confidence of the target shape is low. This is to prevent the tracking to deviate from the real path caused by the cumulated errors such as the uncertain shape. The tracking resumes once the confidence of the object shape is high."

This is a complex problem to be formulated because of the presence of occlusions, misdetections, new object entries etc. that may lead to permanent tracking error. The fuzzy approaches such as the fuzzy Kalman filter, fuzzy particle filter, fuzzy optical flow and fuzzy clustering are widely employed in the non-model based object tracking, where they explicitly take into account the uncertainties to establish the point correspondence between the object motions."

It has been successfully applied in several previous works on the human motion tracking [91, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112]. There are three basic steps involved in the Kalman filtering for human motion tracking: initialization, prediction and correction [113]. Often the complex dynamic trajectories due to the changes in the acceleration of human motion are not feasible to be modeled by the linear systems. Therefore, instead of the basic Kalman filters, the Extended Kalman filters are used which are capable of modeling the non-linear states. However, all these Kalman filtering algorithms suffer from the divergence problem if the theoretical behavior of a filter and its actual behavior do not agree. The divergence due to modeling errors is a critical issue in the Kalman filtering process.\nIn order to solve this, the FIS was adopted in the Kalman filtering [114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119] to detect the bias of measurements and prevent the divergence. The new Kalman filter is called as the fuzzy adaptive Kalman filter. Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is used to detect the divergence and the uncertainty of the parameters in the Kalman filter such as the covariance and the mean value are modeled as membership function with the corresponding fuzzy rules for inference. To this extent, [120] proposed the evolving Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model [121, 122] which can be seen as the fuzzy weighted mixture of the Kalman filter for object tracking in the video streams, and the performance is better than the ordinary Kalman Filter."

In general, if one has a model of how the system changes with time, and possible observations made in particular\nstates, the particle filters can be employed for tracking. However, as compared to the Kalman filters, the particle filters offer a better tracking mechanism as it provides multiple predictions or hypothesis (i.e. as many as hypothesis as the number of particles) to recover from the lost tracks, which helps to overcome the problems related to the complex human motion. One must note that there is a tradeoff between system precision and computational cost in the particle filter framework, i.e. more number of particles improves the system precision, but also increases the computational cost and vice versa.\nAs a remedy to the above mentioned problems, a new sequential fuzzy simulation based particle filter was proposed in [123] to estimate the state of a dynamic system with noises described as fuzzy variables using the possibility theory. In most of the current particle filtering algorithms, the uncertainty of the tracking process and the measurement of noises are expressed by the probability distributions, which are sometimes hard to construct due to the lack of statistical data. Therefore, it is more suitable to compute the possibility measure using the fuzzy set theory for modeling the uncertain variables with imprecise knowledge. [123] found that their proposed fuzzy logic based particle filter outperforms the traditional particle filter even when the number of particles is small. Another variant of this work is [124], where an adaptive model is implemented in the fuzzy particle filter with the capability to adjust the number of particles by using the result from the measurement step, and improve the speed of an object tracking algorithm. Apart from that, [96, 102] handled the tradeoff between the system precision and the computational cost by employing data quantization process that utilizes the Fuzzy Quantity Space [100]. In general, the work quantize the particles into finite fuzzy qualitative states. As such, the system able to model the offset of the tracking errors, while retaining the precision when relatively low number of particles are selected to perform the tracking task. Last but not the least, the FIS has also contributed in the particle filters [125, 126] and achieved better accuracy with lower computational cost."

Fuzzy hostility index was introduced in [129, 130] to overcome this issue and thus improving the time efficiency of the flow computation. The fuzzy hostility index [131] measures the amount of homogeneity or heterogeneity of the neighborhood pixel in the optical flow field. The more homogeneous is the neighborhood of a pixel, the less is the pixel hostile to its neighbor. This implies that a denser neighborhood indicates a more coherent optical flow neighborhood region. To deal with the uncertain conditions, soft computing is applied where the hostility index computed from the neighborhood pixels is represented as a fuzzy set, where the membership values lie between 0 and 1. This method has shown the capability to track fast moving objects from the video sequences efficiently."

Inspired from this, multi-object cluster trackings [133, 134] were introduced with the belief that the moving targets always produce a particular cluster of pixels with similar characteristics in the feature space, and the distribution of these clusters changes only little between the consecutive frames. [132] proposed a fast fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering tracking method which offers a solution towards the high complexity and the computational cost involved in the conventional methods on multi-object tracking, and also the hard clustering algorithms such as the k-means that causes failure in the case of severe occlusions and pervasive disturbances. FCM is also recognized as the soft clustering algorithm where it applies data partition to allocate each sample data into more than one clusters with the corresponding membership values which is more meaningful and stable than the hard clustering algorithms. In [132], the component quantization filtering was incorporated with FCM to provide faster processing speed. Table 4 summarizes the intuition of using the fuzzy approaches in MiL HMA."

Besides that, nowadays, there exists successful commercialized gesture recognition devices such as the Kinect: a vision-based motion sensing device, capable of inferring the human activities. Unfortunately, in a gesture recognition system, the complex backgrounds, dynamic lighting conditions and sometimes the deformable human limb shapes can lead to high level of uncertainties and ambiguities in recognizing the human gestures. Also, “pure” gestures are seldom elicited, as people typically demonstrate “blends” of these gestures [137].

In contrast, the fuzzy clustering algorithm (e.g. FCM), soft computing is applied in the sense that the data partition alleviates the data allocation where each data can belong to more than one clusters and associated with a set of membership values. This solution works better in the challenging environments such as the complex backgrounds, dynamic lighting conditions, and the deformable hand shapes with real-time computational speeds [138, 139, 140, 141].\nUsing the FCM, [138, 139] worked on a fast respond telerobotic gesture-based user interface system.

In [141], the spatial information of hand gesture using the FCM was trained in order to determine the partitioning of the trajectory points into a number of clusters with the fuzzy pseudo-boundaries. In general, each trajectory point belongs to each cluster specified by a membership degree. Then, the temporal data is obtained through the transitions between the states (cluster of trajectory points) of a series of finite state machines to recognize the gesture motion."

The answer is yes where, [168] extended the work to support the additional common elderly activities such as standing, walking, motionless-on-the-chair, and lying-motionless-on-the-couch, with the inclusion of the knowledge about the real world for the identification of the voxels that corresponds to the wall, floor, ceiling, or other static objects or surfaces.

With the knowledge that “soft” boundaries exist in concepts formation of human beings [175], fuzzy set theory has emerged to become one of the most important methodology in capturing notions. In general, fuzzy approach assigns a “soft” boundaries, or in other words performing “soft labeling” where one subject can be associated with many possible classes with a certain degree of confidence. As such, the fuzzy representation is more beneficial than the ordinary (crisp) representations, as it can represent not only the information stated by a well-determined real interval, but also the knowledge embedded in the soft boundaries of the interval. Thus, it removes, or largely weakens the boundary interpretation problem achieved through the description of a gradual rather than an abrupt change in the degree of membership, closer to how humans make decisions and interpret things in the real world.\nThis is also supported by a few notable literatures. For example, [176] in their review on computing with uncertainties emphasized on the fact that the integration of fuzzy models always improves the computer performance in pattern recognition problems. Similarly, [41, 177] presented a survey on how to effectively represent the uncertainty using the FIS. Nevertheless, there are a few studies on the type-2 FIS that have been reported in this regards.

      "heading" : "5.2. Linguistic support",
      "text" : "Another worth highlighting aspect of human behavior is the way they interpret things in the natural scenarios. Human beings mostly employ words in reasoning, arriving at conclusions expressed as words from premises in natural language or having the form of mental perceptions. As used by humans, words have fuzzy denotations. Therefore, modeling the uncertainties in a natural format for humans (i.e. linguistic summarizations) can yield more succinct description of human activities. Inspired from this, HMA can be modeled efficiently by representing an activity in linguistic terms. This concept was initiated in [181] where words can be used in place of numbers for computing and reasoning (like done by humans), commonly known as computing with words (CWW).\nIn CWW, a word is viewed as a fuzzy set of points drawn together by similarity, with the fuzzy set playing the role of a fuzzy constraint on a variable. There are two major imperatives for CWW [181]. Firstly, CWW is a necessity when the available information is too imprecise to justify by the use of numbers. Secondly, when there is a tolerance for imprecision which can be exploited to achieve tractability, robustness, low solution cost, and better rapport with reality. This concept of using CWW i.e. linguistic support to represent the measurement boundaries can be well applied in the real world scenarios. For example, consider the human activities: walking and running, which can be inferred using simple cue i.e. the speed of a person. Different levels of running speeds of a person can be modeled using the linguistic terms such as ‘very slow’, ‘slow’, ‘moderate’, ‘fast’, and ‘very fast’, instead of representing speed in numerical terms. The use of linguistic terms provide the capability to perform human like reasoning such as the feasibility of defining rules for the inference process. With the integration of the linguistic support in the FIS, the computational complexity of the numeric labeling and the imprecision problem in the interpretation stage are also suppressed. Furthermore, the linguistic terms are more understandable where it mimics how humans interpret things and make decisions.\nThe concept of linguistic support is rooted in several papers starting with [182] in which the concepts of a linguistic variable and the granulation were introduced. [181] threw light on the role played by the fuzzy logic in CWW and vice-versa. An interesting piece of work on CWW can be found in [183] where the author defined CWW as a symbolic generalization of the fuzzy logic. In the recent years, several papers have been published that utilizes the concept of linguistic summarization in the fuzzy system that are successfully applied in the real world applications [104, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188]. In these works, a complete sentence instead of numerical data or a crisp answer in a conventional decision making systems is preferable as an output; for example, “the resident has fallen in the living room and is down for a long time”. Such succinct linguistic summarization output is more understandable and closest to the natural answer."

The conventional approaches designed their algorithms to be well-fitted to solve solely some specific problems with low or no extendibility. The world is changing rapidly with the headway of technologies, the flexibility to adapt to such changes is one of the major concerns for a good and long lasting system. Fortunately, the fuzzy approaches allow the alterations to serve the purpose. In addition, the alterations can be made easily on the knowledge base by designing the fuzzy rules.\nThe knowledge base that comprises of all the rules is considered as the most crucial part of a decision making system where it functions as the “brain” of the overall system. As human growth together with knowledge is capable of making better decisions, similarly if a decision making system is provided with sophisticated knowledge, it can deal with the problems in a better manner. The FIS consists of a knowledge base where it can store a number of conditional “IF-THEN” rules that are used for the reasoning process in a specific problem domain. These rules are easy to write and as many rules as necessary can be supplied to describe the problem adequately. For example, consider the problem of identifying different human activities e.g. running. Rules can be designed to infer the running activity using a simple cue (speed) as following:\nRule 1: IF (speed is FAST) THEN (person is RUNNING) Rule 2: IF (speed is MODERATE) THEN (person is NOT RUNNING) However, in the real world scenarios, various factors can affect the speed of a person such as the height, body size, etc. Therefore, in order to make the system closer to natural solution, these rules are needed to be modified\naccordingly. Intuitively, if one may observe the styles of running of a tall person and a shorter person, due to difference in the step size of their feet, the taller person tends to run with a faster speed due to larger step size as compared to the shorter person, running with moderate speed. However, both are performing the running activity, but with different rules. This situation can be modeled by modifying the “Rule 2” as follows:\nRule 2.1: IF (HEIGHT is TALL) & (SPEED is MODERATE) THEN (person is NOT RUNNING) Rule 2.2: IF (HEIGHT is SHORT) & (SPEED is MODERATE) THEN (person is RUNNING)\nSimilarly, the body size can also affect the speed of a person, and can be modeled using flexible fuzzy rules that can be easily added, modified or deleted according to the objective of the system.\nIn a conventional FIS, most of these rules are built with the help of human expert knowledge. For example, in our case, such experts can be doctor, police, forensic expert or researcher, etc. The information that they provide is considered to be the most reliable one as they build it based on their real life experiences and historical analysis. However, human intervention in an intelligent system is becoming a threat due to the heuristic and subjectivity of human decisions. Therefore, automated learning systems have emerged and widely employed in the research society, encouraging learning and generation of fuzzy rules automatically. Several works in the literature have reported efficient methods for the automatic generation of the fuzzy rules such as [189, 190, 191, 192, 193].\nFor example, [189] proposed a method of generating the fuzzy rules by learning from examples, more specifically by the numerical data. Similarly, [190] presented an alternative method to generate the fuzzy rules automatically from the training data with their rules defined in the form of possibility, certainty, gradual, and unless rules. A new approach called the fuzzy extension matrix was proposed in [191] which incorporated the fuzzy entropy to search for the paths and generalized the concept of the crisp extension matrix. Their method was capable of handling the fuzzy representation and tolerating the noisy or missing data. FCM and its variants (e.g. multi-stage random sampling) with its fast performance have also been adopted in the fuzzy rule generation such as the work by [192]. Apart from that, there are works reported in the fuzzy rule generation incorporated with other machine learning techniques. [194] provided an exhaustive survey on the neuro-fuzzy rule generation algorithms, while [193] presented an approach to automatically learn the fuzzy rules by incorporating the genetic algorithm."

      "heading" : "5.4. Potential future works in fuzzy HMA",
      "text" : "Datasets: In the research society nowadays, public datasets play a very important role in order to show the effectiveness of a proposed algorithm. Even so, from our findings in Table 6, there were not much works from the fuzzy community that had explored these public datasets. Only a handful works in the fuzzy HMA (as referred in Table 6) had employed those datasets and compared their works with other algorithms. In order to justify and improve the competency of the fuzzy approaches in HMA, it is believed that one way forward is to start employing these datasets as the baseline study.\nOn the other hand, the datasets listed in Table 6 undeniably has met the objectives as a baseline evaluation. However, [238, 239, 240] raised an argument that many situations in the real life are ambiguous, especially the human behavior with varied perceptions of the masses. The current datasets, at this stage might be too ideal to reflect the real world scenarios, i.e. the current datasets are mutually exclusive, allowing a data to belong to one class (action) only at a time. Therefore, another potential area which can be explored as future works is having an appropriate psycho-physical dataset with fuzzy ground truths, or in a simpler sense: fuzzy datasets. To the best of our knowledge, there do not exist any fuzzy datasets modeling the human activities and their behavior till date.\nEarly event detection: Apart from that, fuzzy approaches being successful in handling the uncertainties in various real-time applications as highlighted in this survey, can be very well explored to be potentially applied in highly complex HMA applications such as human activity forecasting [241] and early detection of crimes [242, 243]. There do not exist literature on the fuzzy capability in handling the uncertainties arising in such scenarios, which have high quotient of importance as they are focusing on forecasting an event or early detecting crimes from happening. Therefore, even the minutest level of uncertainty is required to be taken care of for reliable decision making. Fuzzy approaches with its capability in handling the uncertain situations can substantially benefit in performing these complex tasks, and can be explored by the researchers working in this domain as a potential future work.\nHuman activity recognition in still images: Another interesting area to be explored as part of the future works is the recognition of human activities using still image. The work has has received much attention in the recent past in the\ncomputer vision community [244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250], but as to our very best knowledge, none was found in the fuzzy domain. In this research topic, most of the works considered it to be same as an image classification problem. Lately, several researchers are trying to obtain a thorough understanding of the human poses, the objects, and the interactions between them in a still images to infer the activities. For example, [251] proposed a method to recognize the human-object interactions in still images by explicitly modeling the mutual context between the human poses and the objects, so that each can facilitate the recognition of the other. Their mutual context model outperform the state-of-the-art in object detection, human pose estimation, as well as the recognition of human-object interaction activities. However limited information that can be extracted from the still image and the random noises in the image are two major problems that exists in this area. This can be a potential area to explore by the fuzzy community, providing useful solutions in handling the uncertainties, incomplete data or vague information in regards with the human-object interactions, or human-scene context in still images."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Fuzzy set theory has been effectively applied in many ways that revealed a number of fuzzy approaches such as FIS, FCM, Fuzzy qualitative reasoning, etc. This paper takes the initiative to review the works that employed these fuzzy approaches in the HMA system which has not been done previously. From the studies, one can notice that the fuzzy approaches are capable of handling the uncertainty that abounded in each level of the HMA system (LoL, MiL, and HiL). The fundamental factors that endowed such capability to the fuzzy approaches include the ability to perform soft labeling and the flexibility to adapt to different uncertainties. However, most of the reported works herein did not utilize the standard HMA datasets as their baseline. Anyway, the current datasets are mostly too ideal to reflect the real world scenarios that is full of uncertainties. The generation of the fuzzy dataset for HMA could be one of the potential future works other than the early event detection and the still image action recognition."

However, most of these real world applications face high levels of uncertainties that can affect the operations of such applications. Hence, the fuzzy set theory has been applied and showed great success in the recent past. In this paper, we aim at reviewing the fuzzy set oriented approaches for HMA, individuating how the fuzzy set may improve the HMA, envisaging and delineating the future perspectives. To the best of our knowledge, there is not found a single survey in the current literature that has discussed and reviewed fuzzy approaches towards the HMA. For ease of understanding, we conceptually classify the human motion into three broad levels: Low-Level (LoL), Mid-Level (MiL), and High-Level (HiL) HMA.",
