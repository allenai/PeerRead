The model is based on a standard recurrent neural network with a memory cell as in LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The input layer of the model consists of three sub-vectors: beginning (b), internal (i), and ending (e) character(s) of the input word (Figure 1). This semi-character level recurrent neural network is referred as scRNN.\nFirst, we review previous work on the robust word recognition mechanism from psycholinguistics literature (§2). Next, we describe technical details of scRNN which capture the robust human mechanism (§3) using recent developments in neural networks. Our experiments show that the scRNN outperforms commonly used spelling checkers by 42% for jumbled word correction (§4.1) and 5% and 27% in other noise types (insertion and deletion). We also show that scRNN replicates recent findings from psycholinguistics experiments on reading difficulty (i.e. accuracy) depending on the position of jumbled letters, which indicates that scRNN successfully mimics ar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n02 21\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nA ug\n2 01\n6\n(at least a part of) the human word recognition mechanism (§4.2)."

      "text" : "Sentence processing with jumbled words has been a major research topic in psycholinguistics literature. Forster et al. (1987) show that a jumbled word (e.g. anwser-ANSWER) facilitates primes as large as identity primes (answer-ANSWER) in a masked priming paradigm and these results have been confirmed (Perea and Lupker, 2004; Guerrera and Forster, 2008).\nThese findings about robust word processing mechanism by human have been further investigated by looking at other types of noise in addition to simple letter transpositions. Humphreys et al. (1990) show that deleting a letter in a word still produces significant priming effect (e.g. blckBLACK), and similar results have been shown in other research (Peressotti and Grainger, 1999; Grainger et al., 2006). Van Assche and Grainger (2006) demonstrate that a priming effect remains when inserting a character into a word (e.g. juastice-JUSTICE).\nWith an eye-movement paradigm, Rayner et al. (2006) and Johnson et al. (2007) conduct more detailed experiments on the robust word recognition mechanism with jumbled letters. They show that letter transposition affects fixation time measures during reading depending on which part of the word is jumbled. Table 1 presents the result from Rayner et al. (2006). It is obvious that human can read smoothly (i.e. smaller number of fixations, regression, and average of fixation duration) when a given sentence has no noise (referred this condition as N). When the characters at the beginning of word are jumbled (referred this condition as BEG), human have more difficulty. The other two conditions, where words are internally jumbled (INT) or letters at word endings are jumbled\n(END), have similar amount of effect, although the number of fixations between them showed a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). In short, the reading difficulty with different jumble conditions is summarized as follows: N < INT ≤ END < BEG.\nIt may be surprising that there is statistically significant difference between END and BEG conditions despite the difference being very subtle (i.e. fixing either the first or the last character). This result demonstrates the importance of beginning letters for human word recognition.1"

      "text" : "In order to achieve the human-like robust word processing mechanism, we propose a semi-character based recurrent neural network (scRNN). The scRNN has the same structure as a standard recurrent neural network except that the input vector consists of three sub-vectors that correspond to the characters’ position. The first and third sub-vectors (bn, en) represent the first and last character of the n-th word. These two subvectors are therefore one-hot representations. The second sub-vector (in) represents a bag of characters of the word not including the initial and final positions. For example, the word “University” is represented as bn = {U = 1}, en = {y = 1}, and in = {e = 1, i = 2, n = 1, s = 1, r = 1, t = 1, v = 1}, with all the other elements being zero. The size of sub-vectors (bn, in, en) is equal to the number of characters (N ) in our language, and xn has therefore the size of 3N by concatenating the sub-vectors.\nWith this input vector (xn), the recurrent neural\n1There is still a debate in psycholinguistics community whether or not the order of internal letters does not matter at all. In this paper, we keep the original hypothesis in order for our model to be simple.\nnet model is described as follows.\nxn = bnin en  (1) hn = LSTM(Wxh · xn +Whh · hn−1) (2) yn = softmax(Why · hn) (3)\nThe input vector is used as input to a hidden layer (hn) which is an LSTM. The LSTM layer has a recurrent input from its previous state (hn−1). The output of the hidden layer is taken as input to the softmax function layer, which predicts an output word (yn). We use the cross-entropy training criterion applied to the output layer as in most LSTM language modeling works; the model learns the weight matrices (Whh, Why) to maximize the likelihood of the training data. This should approximately correlate with maximizing the number of exact word match in the predicted outputs. Figure 1 shows a pictorial overview of scRNN.\nIn order to check if the scRNN can recognize the jumbled words correctly, we test it in spelling correction experiments. If the hypothesis about the robust word processing mechanism is correct, scRNN will also be able to read sentences with jumbled words robustly."

We used\nPenn Treebank for training, tuning, and testing.2 The input layer consists of a vector with length of 76 (A-Z, a-z and 24 symbol characters). The hidden layer units had size 650, and total vocabulary size was set to 10k. We apply one type of noise to every word except that all words with numbers (e.g. 1980s) and short words (length ≤ 3) are not subjected to jumbling and were left as is, and therefore these words are excluded in evaluation. We trained the model by running 5 epochs with batch size 20. In order to make the training efficient, we set the backpropagation through time (BPTT) parameter to 3."

      "text" : "We tested different noise types: jumble, delete, and insert, where the jumble changes the internal characters (e.g. Cambridge → Cmbarigde), delete randomly deletes one of the internal characters (Cambridge → Camridge), and insert randomly inserts an alphabet into an internal position (Cambridge → Cambpridge). None of the noise types change the first and last characters. For comparison, we ran two widely-used spelling checkers (Commercial3 and Hunspell4).\nother spelling checkers. The only error in scRNN may be because the last character (rscheearch) activated the scRNN nodes strongly toward research instead of researcher.6\nTable 3 shows the result with respect to noise type. Overall, scRNN outperforms the other two spelling checkers across all three different noise types. It is striking that scRNN shows robustness in jumble noise, whereas the other models are significantly affected. All three models suffer under the delete condition, but scRNN still maintains 85% of accuracy whereas the other models decreased to 58% and 35% accuracy.\nThe relatively large drop in delete in scRNN may be because the information lost by deleting character is significant. For example, when the word place has dropped the character l, the surface form becomes pace, which is also a valid word. Also, the word mess with e being deleted produces the form of mss, which can be recovered as mess, mass, miss, etc. In the Cmabrigde Uinervtisy sentences, in both cases, the local context support other phrase such as ‘at the right pace/place’ and ‘a total mass/mess’. These examples clearly demonstrate that deleting characters harm the word recognition more significantly than other noise types.\nFinally, all the three models perform well on insert noise, indicating that adding extraneous information by inserting a letter does not change the original information significantly."

INT is the same model as §3, END represents an input word as a concatenation of the initial character vector (b) and a vector for the rest of characters (i.e. the internal and last characters are subject to jumbling), and BEG combines a vector for the final character (e) and a vector for the rest of characters (i.e. the initial and internal characters are subject to jumbling). We also add another jumble type ALL, where all the letters are subject to jumble (e.g. research vs. eesrhrca) and represented as a single vector (i.e. bag of characters).\nTable 4.1 shows the result. While scRNN achieves the high accuracy for all the jumble types, the statistical test revealed that the difficulty of spelling correction is summarized as INT < END < BEG < ALL, which has the same order as §2. It is especially interesting to see the same pattern between END and BEG. This indicates the scRNN replicates (at least a part of) the human word recognition mechanism."

Although scRNN has some similarity in terms of model architecture with these recent works, our contribution is the demonstration of the robustness and cognitive plausibility of semi-character-based recurrent neural networks for word recognition.\nCharacter-level convolutional neural nets (CNN) have also been noted (Kim et al., 2015) and used for spelling correction (Schmaltz et al.,\n2016). While CNNs have a richer representation, scRNN still achieves high accuracy in jumbled word recognition with a simpler RNN structure (i.e. no convolution layers are required) resulting in fast training time and small model size."

Inspired by the findings from the Cmabrigde Uinervtisy effect, we propose a word recognition model based on a semi-character level recursive neural network (scRNN). In our experiments, we demonstrate that scRNN has significantly more robust performance in word spelling correction (i.e. word recognition) compared to existing spelling checkers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model is cognitively plausible by replicating a psycholinguistics experiment about human reading difficulty using our model.",
