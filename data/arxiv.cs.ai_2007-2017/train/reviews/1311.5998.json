We collected and mined through the IEEE publish data base to analysis the geological and chronological variance of the activeness of research in AI. The connections between different institutes are showed. The result shows that the leading community of AI research are mainly in the USA, China, the Europe and Japan. The key institutes, authors and the research hotspots are revealed. It is found that the research institutes in the fields like Data Mining, Computer Vision, Pattern Recognition and some other fields of Machine Learning are quite consistent, implying a strong interaction between the community of each field. It is also showed that the research of Electronic Engineering and Industrial or Commercial applications are very active in California. Japan is also publishing a lot of papers in robotics. Due to the limitation of data source, the result might be overly influenced by the number of published articles, which is to our best improved by applying network keynode analysis on the research community instead of merely count the number of publish.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 23 Nov 2013 13:54:36 GMT  (5215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5998v1", "18 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL", "authors": ["yunpeng li", "jie liu", "yong deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.5998"}
