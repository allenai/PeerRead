      "text" : "Automatic segmentation of the liver and hepatic lesion is an important step towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and computer-aided decision support systems. This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation of a large-scale medical trial or quantitative image analysis. We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.\nKeywords: Liver, Lesion, Segmentation, FCN, CRF, Deep Learning"

      "text" : "Anomalies in the shape and texture of the liver and visible lesions in CT are important biomarkers for initial disease diagnosis and progression in both primary and secondary hepatic tumor disease [1].\nPrimary tumors such as breast, colon and pancreas cancer often spread metastases to the liver during the course of disease. Therefore, the liver and its lesions are analyzed in\n1Authors contributed equally\nPreprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis February 21, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n05 97\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n0 Fe\nprimary tumor staging. In addition, the liver is also a site of primary tumor disease such as Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presents the sixth-most common cancer and the third-most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [2]. HCC comprises a genetically and molecularly highly heterogeneous group of cancers that commonly arise in a chronically damaged liver. Importantly, HCC subtypes differ significantly in clinical outcome. The stepwise transformation to HCC is accompanied by major changes in tissue architecture including an increase in cellularity and a switch in vascular supply (i.e. arterialization). These quantifiable changes in tissue architecture provide the basis for the non-invasive detection of HCC in imaging [3], but also lead to highly variable structures and shapes.\nIn clinical routine, manual or semi-manual segmentation techniques are applied. These, however, are subjective, operator-dependent and very time-consuming. In order to improve the productivity of radiologists, computer-aided methods have been developed in the past. However, an automated robust segmentation of combined liver and lesion remains still an open problem because of challenges as a low-contrast between liver and lesion, different types of contrast levels (hyper-/hypo-intense tumors), abnormalities in tissues (such as after surgical resection of metastasis), size and varying number of lesions. As shown in figure 1 the heterogeneity in liver and lesion contrast is very large among subjects. Different acquisition protocols, differing contrast-agents, varying levels of contrast enhancements and dissimilar scanner resolutions lead to unpredictable intensity differences between liver and lesion tissue. This complexity of contrast differences make it difficult for intensity-based methods to generalize to unseen test cases from different clinical sites. In addition, the varying shape of lesions due to irregular tumor growth and response to treatment (i.e surgical resection) reduce efficiency of the shape based methods."

      "text" : "Nevertheless, several interactive and automatic methods have been developed to segment the liver and liver lesions in CT volumes. In 2007 and 2008, two Grand Challenges benchmarks on liver and liver lesion segmentation have been conducted [1, 4]. Methods presented at the challenges were mostly based on statistical shape models. Furthermore, grey level and texture based methods have been developed [1]. Recent work on liver and lesion segmentation employs graph cut and level set techniques [5, 6, 7], sigmoid edge modeling [8] or manifold and machine learning [9, 10, 11, 12]. However, these methods are not widely applied in clinics, due to their speed and robustness on heterogeneous, low-contrast real-life CT data. To overcome these weaknesses, interactive methods were still developed [13] to overcome these weaknesses.\nDeep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have gained a new attention in the scientific community for solving computer vision tasks such as object recognition, classification and segmentation [14, 15], often out-competing state-of-the art methods. Most importantly, CNN methods have proven to be highly robust to varying image appearance, which motivates us to apply them to fully automatic liver and lesions segmentation in CT volumes.\nSemantic image segmentation methods based on fully convolutional neural networks FCN were developed in [15], with impressive results in natural image segmentation competitions\n[16, 17]. Likewise, new segmentation methods based on CNN and FCNs were developed for medical image analysis, with highly competitive results compared to state-of-the-art. [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]."

First, we train and apply fully convolutional CNN on CT volumes of the liver for the first time, demonstrating the adaptability to challenging segmentation of hepatic liver lesions. Second, we propose to use a cascaded fully convolutional neural network (CFCN) on CT slices, which segments liver and lesions sequentially, leading to significantly higher segmentation quality, as demonstrated on a public challenge dataset. Third, we experimentally demonstrate the generalization and scalability of our methods to different modalities and diverse real-life datasets, including a novel DW-MRI dataset and a clinical CT dataset. A preliminary version of this work was presented in MICCAI 2016 [26] and will be presented at ISBI 20172. In this paper, we have substantially revised and extended the original papers.

We increased contrast through histogram equalization. Figure 3 shows also the final slice after HU-windowing and contrastenhancement. The contrast within the liver has been enhanced to allow better differentiation of abnormal liver tissue. For DW-MRI the data preparation scheme is similar and differs in the data normalization, which additionally performs N4bias correction [27].\nAs in [18, 22], to teach the network the desired invariance properties, several data augmentations steps, such as elastic deformation, translation, rotation and addition of Gaussian noise with standard deviation of the current slice, have been employed to increase the training data for the CFCN. Our data augmentation schemes can be found in our sourcecode3."

      "heading" : "2.3.1. From AlexNET to UNET",
      "text" : "Long et al. (2015) presented the first fully convolutional network architecture for semantic segmentation [15]. The main idea in their work is to replace the last fully connected layers of a classification network such as the AlexNet [14] with fully convolutional layers to allow dense pixel-wise predictions. The last fully convolutional layers have to be upscaled to match the input dimensions. In comparison to prior work, the AlexFCN allows pixelwise prediction from full-sized medical slices, instead of patch-wise classification. Figures 4a and 4b show the training curves for training the AlexFCN (without class balancing) on 3DIRCAD dataset. Both training curves converged fast to a steady state in training and test Dice overlap. Both training curves show a large overfitting of the AlexFCN without class balancing, with Dice overlaps of 71%/90% in test/training data for liver, and 24%/60% for lesions. In general the lesion Dice of 24% at test time is comparable low. Long et al. (2015) explicitly stated that they did not need to apply class balancing to their natural image segmentation problem. A reason for this is that they used pretrained AlexNet weights trained on natural images, i.e. ImageNet data. However, for many medical applications it is mandatory to apply class balancing since pre-trained networks from natural images cannot be used properly and the class of interest occurs more seldomly in the dataset. Figures 4c and 4d show the importance of class balancing in medical image segmentation. The training and test Dice for both liver and lesions increases noticeably to 78% for liver and 38% for lesions. A further large improvement can be obtained by applying the UNET Architecture proposed by Ronneberger et al. (2015) [18]. Besides the increased depth of 19 layers and learnable upscaling (up-convolution), the UNET provides a superior design pattern of skip connections between different stages of the neural network.\nIn early stages of the neural network, spatial information is present in the activations of the current stage. In later stages of the neural network, spatial information gets transferred to semantic information at sacrifice of spatial information due to small sizes of activations of 28x28 in the UNET bottleneck. Ronneberger et al. introduced skip-connections to allow\nutilization of spatial and semantic information at later stage, since the spatial information from earlier stage can be fused in the neural network at later stages. Thus the neural network at later stages can utilize semantic and spatial information to infer information."

      "text" : "We used the UNet architecture [18] to compute the soft label probability maps P (xi|I). The UNet architecture enables accurate pixel-wise prediction by combining spatial and contextual information in a network architecture comprising 19 convolutional layers. Figures 4e and 4f show the training curves for the UNet on 3DIRCAD data set. The overall performance of the lesion segmentation is further increased to 53% test Dice. The UNet learned features to discriminate liver and lesion at the same time. As one of our main contributions, we propose a cascaded training of FCNs to learn specific features for solving a segmentation task once per training, which leads to higher segmentation performance.\nThe motivation behind the cascade approach is that it has been shown that UNets and other forms of CNNs learn a hierarchical representation of the provided data. The stacked layers of convolutional filters are tailored towards the desired classification in a data-driven manner, as opposed to designing hand-crafted features for separation of different tissue types. By cascading two UNets, we ensure that the UNet in step 1 learns filters that are specific for the detection and segmentation of the liver from an overall abdominal CT scan, while the UNet in step 2 arranges a set of filters for separation of lesions from the liver tissue. Furthermore, the liver ROI helps in reducing false positives for lesions. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate our proposed method. We train one network to segment the liver in abdomen slices (step 1). This network can solely concentrate on learning discriminative features for liver vs. background segmentation, e.g. figure 5. After that we train another network to segment the lesions, given an image of the liver (step 2). The segmented liver from step 1 is cropped and re-sampled to the required input size for the cascaded UNet in step 2. All nonliver regions are masked out and the second UNet can concentrate on learning discriminative features for lesion vs. liver background segmentation."

This concepts do not have be trained again from scratch when using pretrained models. For our experiments we used pretrained UNet models provided by Ronneberger et al.

In addition, the anisotropic resolution of medical volumes (e.g. 0.57-0.8mm in xy and 1.25-4mm in z voxel dimension in 3DIRCADb) complicates the training of discriminative 3D filters. Instead, to capitalise on the locality information across slices within the dataset, we utilize 3D dense conditional random fields CRFs as proposed by [30]. To account for 3D information, we consider all slice-wise predictions of the FCN together in the CRF applied to the entire volume at once.\n4Sourcecode and models are available at https://github.com/IBBM/Cascaded-FCN\nWe formulate the final label assignment given the soft predictions (probability maps) from the FCN as maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference in a dense CRF, allowing us to consider both spatial coherence and appearance.\nWe specify the dense CRF following [30] on the complete graph G = (V , E) with vertices i ∈ V for each voxel in the image and edges eij ∈ E = {(i, j) ∀i, j ∈ V s.t. i < j} between all vertices. The variable vector x ∈ LN describes the label of each vertex i ∈ V .

For hepatic- cellular carcinoma HCC, prior work relied on manual liver and lesion segmentation in DW-MRI to calculate features over the liver and lesion ROI in the ADC sequence to predict patient survival. In contrast to prior work, we trained a CFCN to automatically segment liver and lesion segmentation in DW-MRI to allow automatic survival predictions. We formulate this task as a classification problem with classes being “low risk” and “high risk” represented by longer or shorter survival times than the median survival. We predict HCC malignancy in two steps: As the first step we automatically segment HCC tumor lesions using our proposed method of cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCN). As the second step we predict the HCC lesions’ malignancy from the HCC tumor segmentation in the MR-DWI sequence using classical texture features and 3D CNN features. As one of our main contributions we found, that endto-end assessment of tumor malignancy based on our proposed cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCN) corresponds to assessment based on expert annotations with high significance (p > 0.95).

The proposed idea of cascaded FCN could also be applied to novel 3D CNN and 3D FCN architectures. The restriction of the Region of Interest ROI to relevant organs as shown for the 2D UNET, when restricting to liver only pixels for segmenting lesions, significantly boosts the segmentation accuracy. The intuition that more specific filters for the underlying problem could be trained, when restricting the relevant regions, holds for 3D as well. Future work will show whether 3D architectures could cope with less training data available for lesion segmentation."

      "text" : "We showed a statistically significant improvement of segmentation quality, when applying the 3DCRF to our segmentation problem. However, tuning of hyperparameters such as those of the 3DCRF is very time-consuming and task dependent. We found that for highly heterogeneous structures in shape and appearance, such as HCC lesions, it is hard to find a hyperparameter set that generalizes to unseen cases with a random search. A similar conclusion was made in [22] when applying a 3DCRF to heterogeneous brain lesions. Recent work successfully integrated the learning of the CRF hyperparameter in the training process [17]. This approach in combination with additional pairwise terms that incorporate prior knowlegde of the problem could lead to a improvement of the CRF for this task."

      "text" : "Cascaded FCNs and dense 3D CRFs trained on CT volumes are suitable for automatic localization and combined volumetric segmentation of the liver and its lesions. Our proposed method competes with state-of-the-art. We provide our trained models under open-source license allowing fine-tuning for other medical applications in CT data 10. Additionally, we introduced and evaluated dense 3D CRF as a post-processing step for deep learning-based medical image analysis. Furthermore, and in contrast to prior work such as [8, 6, 5], our proposed method could be generalized to segment multiple organs in medical data using multiple cascaded FCNs. As future work, the application of further cascaded FCNs on lesions ROIs to classify malignancy of the lesions as well as advanced techniques such as data augmentation using adversarial networks could enhance the accuracy of the segmentation further. All in all, heterogeneous CT and DW-MRI volumes from different scanners and protocols can be segmented in under 100s each with the proposed approach. We conclude that CFCNs are promising tools for automatic analysis of liver and its lesions in clinical routine and large-scale clinical trials.\n10Trained models are available at https://github.com/IBBM/Cascaded-FCN"

This paper presents a method to automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation of a large-scale medical trial or quantitative image analysis. We train and cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.",
