      "text" : "Competitive gaming does not just attract professional players only, but also many spectators who are interested in the game as well. Tournament is a competitive system. It provides some prizes as objectives for participants to compete with each other. It is often used as a formal method to conduct official gaming event, to gather professional players, as well as to attract a large number of spectators. Such large scale events usually receive sponsorship from various companies and organizations. Therefore, it is necessary to be carefully prepared and conducted to be able to avoid disappointments from any party.\nThere are three main concerns in tournament systems:\n1. Firstly, conduction cost (CC). That is, the number of matches required to conduct.\n2. Secondly, competitiveness development (CD). That is, to minimize the throwaway matches in which participants are not so motivated to play their best. Regarding competitive gaming, some researches observe that uneven teams tend to make a reduced interest from viewers [1, 2, 3]. However, the structure of the tournament may have great effect on motivation of the participants. It is important to plan the matches carefully, giving the participants reasons to do their best in the game.\n3. And finally, ranking precision (RP). That is, to make sure the ranking results of the tournament is convincing and reliable. Only that would be able to prove the prize winners are really worthy.\nRegarding the maintaining competitiveness issue, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no study of any method to perform this work. Therefore, we propose a new method to analyze this matter.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n08 49\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nN ov\n2 01\n6\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents our method for analyzing tournament structures with a focus on competitiveness development and ranking precision. Section 3 shows an analysis of tournament structures including single-elimination, double-elimination and round-robin style. Section 4 discusses the analyzing results and evaluation. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section 5"

      "text" : "A competitive match means that the two participants are motivated to compete over the winning outcome. Usually, the desire to win is normal. But sometimes, the benefit of winning could be insignificant which causes the participants to not yearn for a win. The motivation of a participant consists of many factors, but we restrict ourselves to the tournament structure in this study. We introduce ”progress tree” to demonstrate the perspective of the participants on a tournament to analyze their motivation development throughout the tournament.\nThe progress tree is constructed based on the graphical model approach [4]. A participant’s state before or after playing a match is considered as a node. The state in which the participant no longer plays any match is a leaf node. We show, in Figure 1, an example of single elimination tournament for 8 participants, and Figure 2 shows its progress tree.\nWhile ”competitive” means having an objective for which participants have to compete with one another, it is common to have more than one prize as objectives in a tournament. Thus, it is necessary to have the prizes comparable in order to have the consistency in competitiveness. For example, if we have a spoon as the first prize, and a pair chopsticks as the second prize. Each participant may have different evaluation on these prizes. Hence, it is possible to have a participant trying to lose on purpose in the final to be able to get the pair of chopsticks. This is also the reason why most grand tournaments use money for prizes instead of objects, since the amounts of money are comparable, the consistency between the prizes is ensured.\nWith the consistent prizes in the same unit, we would be able to evaluate nodes in the progress tree. Since we are only considering the structure of the tournament, we evaluate a node as the average value of its direct child nodes. For example, in Figure 2 tournament, let x1, x2, x3 and x4 be 1st place prize, 2nd prize, 3rd-4th prize and 5th-8th prize. Then we have x1 ≥ x2 ≥ x3 ≥ x4. Table 1 shows the evaluation of other nodes. We call this value ”stability” value.\nWith progress tree and having the nodes evaluated, we see that there are two concerns regarding competitiveness or motivation development:\nStability progressing For every node, it is preferable to have the value of the winning outcome larger than the losing outcome. This ensures that the winning outcome has more benefits and is more attractive to the participant.\nPossibility of results Since the prizes serve as an objective to maintain the competitiveness, the case where a prize is no longer able to achieve also means that a competitive objective is lost. However, in a tournament, to achieve a prize means to give up other prizes (one cannot get the first prize and second prize together). Therefore, it is favorable to have the prizes dropping out eventually in the manner of least-valuable first."

      "heading" : "2.2 Ranking Precision",
      "text" : "Being a competitive system, the outcome of the tournament should avoid any complains about its ranking results. We consider tournament as a comparison/sorting problem, and each match is a comparison between two participants. We assume that there is a game where a stronger player always wins against a weaker one, and we have all participants with different strengths. There are two ways to verify the ranking precision of a tournament of such game: by mathematical proof, or by running all possibilities. In this paper we simply use the permutation to experiment all outcome possibilities. Then, we can see if the results are precise or not. However, the method of using permutation experiment is too heavy if the number of participants is too large. In this paper, we therefore conduct experiments with eight participants only."

However, double elimination has two starting nodes (see Figure 4). It can be argued that double elimination is designed for a multi-stage system, or the players are distributed properly by using a rating system [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Thus, it is expected to have stronger participants and weaker participants distributed (seeded) into upper bracket and lower bracket properly. We perform another experiment this way, as a seeded double elimination. There will be 4! ∗ 4! = 576 cases this time.\nTable 6 shows the result of the seeded double elimination. It is precise from 1st to 4th ranking. This is quite a big improvement compared to single elimination, but with the cost of having a little more matches and having a proper seeding system."

As the tournament progresses, the unknown leaves will gradually reveal, and the stability values of the nodes would be calculated.

It concerns about three aspects such as tournament conducting cost, competitiveness development and ranking precision. It then proposes a new method using progress tree to detect potential throwaway matches. The analysis performed using the proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures. As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness. Double elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners. A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in exchange of being able to qualify top four winners. Round-robin gives reliable ranking precision for all participants. However, its conduction cost is very high, and it fails to maintain competitiveness development.",
