      "text" : "Given the data-driven nature of neural machine translation (NMT), the limited source-to-target bilingual sentence pairs have been one of the major obstacles in building competitive NMT systems. Recently, pseudo parallel data, which refer to the synthetic bilingual sentence pairs automatically generated by existing translation models, have reported promising results with regard to the data scarcity in NMT. Many studies have found that the pseudo parallel data combined with the real bilingual parallel corpus significantly enhance the quality of NMT models (Sennrich et al., 2015a; Zhang and Zong, 2016b; Cheng et al., 2016b). In addition, synthesized parallel data have played vital roles in many NMT problems such as domain adaptation (Sennrich et al., 2015a), zeroresource NMT (Firat et al., 2016b), and the rare word problem (Zhang and Zong, 2016a).\nInspired by their efficacy, we attempt to train NMT models using only synthetic parallel data.\nTo the best of our knowledge, building NMT systems with only pseudo parallel data has yet to be studied. Through our research, we explore the availability of synthetic parallel data as an effective alternative to the real-world parallel corpus. The active usage of synthetic data in NMT particularly has its significance in low-resource environments where the ground truth parallel corpora are very limited or not established. Even in recent approaches such as zero-shot NMT (Johnson et al., 2016) and pivot-based NMT (Cheng et al., 2016a), where direct source-to-target bilingual data are not required, the direct parallel corpus brings substantial improvements in translation quality where the pseudo parallel data can also be employed.\nPreviously suggested synthetic data, however, have several drawbacks to be a reliable alternative to the real parallel corpus. As illustrated in Figure 1, existing pseudo parallel corpora can be classified into two groups: source-originated and target-originated. The common property between them is that ground truth examples exist only on a single side (source or target) of pseudo sentence pairs, while the other side is composed of synthetic sentences only. The bias of synthetic examples in sentence pairs, however, may lead to the imbalance of the quality of learned NMT models when the given pseudo parallel corpus is exploited in bidirectional translation tasks (e.g., French→German and German→French). In addition, the reliability of the synthetic parallel data is heavily influenced by a single translation model where the synthetic examples originate. Lowquality synthetic sentences generated by the translation model would prevent NMT models from learning solid parameters.\nTo overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel synthetic parallel corpus called PSEUDOmix. In contrast to previous works, PSEUDOmix includes both synthetic and real sentences on either side of sentence pairs. In practice, it can be readily built by mixing sourceand target-originated pseudo parallel corpora for\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 25\n3v 4\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 Se\np 20\n17\na given translation task. Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed PSEUDOmix shows useful properties that make it a reliable candidate for real-world parallel data. In detail, we make the following contributions:\n1. PSEUDOmix shows more balanced translation quality compared to existing pseudo parallel corpora in bidirectional translation tasks. For each task, it outperforms both source- and target-originated data when their performance gap is under a certain range.\n2. When fine-tuned using real parallel data, the model trained with PSEUDOmix outperforms other fine-tuned models trained with source-originated and target-originated synthetic parallel data, indicating substantial improvement in translation quality."

      "text" : "Given a source sentence x = (x1, . . . , xm) and its corresponding target sentence y = (y1, . . . , yn), the NMT aims to model the conditional probability p(y|x) with a single large neural network. To parameterize the conditional distribution, recent studies on NMT employ the encoder-decoder architecture (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014b; Sutskever et al., 2014). Thereafter, the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015) has been introduced and successfully addressed the quality degradation of NMT when dealing with long input sentences (Cho et al., 2014a).\nIn this study, we use the attentional NMT architecture proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014). In their work, the encoder, which is a bidirectional recurrent neural network, reads the source sentence and generates a sequence of source representations h = (h1, . . . ,hm). The decoder, which is another recurrent neural network, produces the target sentence one symbol at a time. The log conditional probability thus can be decomposed as follows:\nlog p(y|x) = n∑ t=1 log p(yt|y<t, x) (1)\nwhere y<t = (y1, . . . , yt−1). As described in Equation (2), the conditional distribution of p(yt|y<t, x) is modeled as a function of the previously predicted output yt−1, the hidden state of the decoder st, and the context vector ct.\np(yt|y<t, x) ∝ exp{g(yt−1, st, ct)} (2)\nThe context vector ct is used to determine the relevant part of the source sentence to predict yt. It\nis computed as the weighted sum of source representations h1, . . . ,hm. Each weight αti for hi implies the probability of the target symbol yt being aligned to the source symbol xi:\nct = m∑ i=1 αtihi (3)\nGiven a sentence-aligned parallel corpus of size N , the entire parameter θ of the NMT model is jointly trained to maximize the conditional probabilities of all sentence pairs {(xn, yn)}Nn=1:\nθ∗ = argmax θ N∑ n=1 log p(yn|xn) (4)\nwhere θ∗ is the optimal parameter."

      "text" : "In statistical machine translation (SMT), synthetic bilingual data have been primarily proposed as a means to exploit monolingual corpora. By applying a self-training scheme, the pseudo parallel data were obtained by automatically translating the source-side monolingual corpora (Ueffing et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2008). In a similar but reverse way, the target-side monolingual corpora were also employed to build the synthetic parallel data (Bertoldi and Federico, 2009; Lambert et al., 2011). The primary goal of these works was to adapt trained SMT models to other domains using relatively abundant in-domain monolingual data.\nInspired by the successful application in SMT, there have been efforts to exploit synthetic parallel data in improving NMT systems. Sourceside (Zhang and Zong, 2016b), target-side (Sennrich et al., 2015a) and both sides (Cheng et al., 2016b) of the monolingual data have been used to build synthetic parallel corpora. In their work, the pseudo parallel data combined with a real training corpus significantly enhanced the translation quality of NMT. In Sennrich et al., (2015a), domain adaptation of NMT was achieved by finetuning trained NMT models using a synthetic parallel corpus. Firat et al. (2016b) attempted to build NMT systems without any direct source-to-target parallel corpus. In their work, the pseudo parallel corpus was employed in fine-tuning the targetspecific attention mechanism of trained multi-way multilingual NMT (Firat et al., 2016a) models, which enabled zero-resource NMT between the source and target languages. Lastly, synthetic sentence pairs have been utilized to enrich the training examples having rare or unknown translation lexicons (Zhang and Zong, 2016a)."

      "text" : "As described in the previous section, synthetic parallel data have been widely used to boost the performance of NMT. In this work, we further extend their application by training NMT with only synthetic data. In certain language pairs or domains where the source-to-target real parallel corpora are very rare or even unprepared, the model trained with synthetic parallel data can function as an effective baseline model. Once the additional ground truth parallel corpus is established, the trained model can be improved by retraining or fine-tuning using the real parallel data."

      "text" : "For a given translation task, we classify the existing pseudo parallel data into the following groups:\n(a) Source-originated: The source sentences are from a real corpus, and the associated target sentences are synthetic. The corpus can be formed by automatically translating a sourceside monolingual corpus into the target language (Zhang and Zong, 2016a,b). It can also be built from source-pivot bilingual data by\nintroducing a pivot language. In this case, a pivot-to-target translation model is employed to translate the pivot language corpus into the target language. The generated target sentences paired with the original source sentences form a pseudo parallel corpus.\n(b) Target-originated: The target sentences are from a real corpus, and the associated source sentences are synthetic. The corpus can be formed by back-translating a target-side monolingual corpus into the source language (Sennrich et al., 2015a). Similar to the source-originated case, it can be built from a pivot-target bilingual corpus using a pivot-tosource translation model (Firat et al., 2016b).\nThe process of building each synthetic parallel corpus is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, the previous studies on pseudo parallel data share a common property: synthetic and ground truth sentences are biased on a single side of sentence pairs. In such a case where the synthetic parallel data are the only or major resource used to train NMT, this may severely limit the availability of the given pseudo parallel corpus. For instance, as will be demonstrated in our experiments, synthetic data showing relatively high quality in one translation task (e.g., French→German) can pro-\nduce poor results in the translation task of the reverse direction (German→French).\nAnother drawback of employing synthetic parallel data in training NMT is that the capacity of the synthetic parallel corpus is inherently influenced by the mother translation model from which the synthetic sentences originate. Depending on the quality of the mother model, ill-formed or inaccurate synthetic examples could be generated, which would negatively affect the reliability of the resultant synthetic parallel data. In the previous study, Zhang and Zong (2016b) bypassed this issue by freezing the decoder parameters while training with the minibatches of pseudo bilingual pairs made from a source language monolingual corpus. This scheme, however, cannot be applied to our scenario as the decoder network will remain untrained during the entire training process."

      "text" : "To overcome the limitations of the previously suggested pseudo parallel data, we propose a new type of synthetic parallel corpus called PSEUDOmix. Our approach is quite straightforward: For a given translation task, we first build both sourceoriginated and target-originated pseudo parallel data. PSEUDOmix can then be readily built by mixing them together. The overall process of building PSEUDOmix for the French→German translation task is illustrated in Figure 1.\nBy mixing source- and target-originated pseudo parallel data, the resultant corpus includes both real and synthetic examples on either side of sentence pairs, which is the most evident feature of PSEUDOmix. Through the mixing approach, we attempt to lower the overall discrepancy in the quality of the source and target examples of synthetic sentence pairs, thus enhancing the reliability as a parallel resource. In the following section, we evaluate the actual benefits of the mixed composition in the synthetic parallel data."

      "text" : "Before we choose the pivot language-based method for data synthesis, we conduct a preliminary experiment analyzing both pivot-based and direct back-translation. The model used for direct back-translation was trained with the ground truth Europarl Fr-De data made from the multiparallel corpus presented in Table 2. On the newstest 2012/2013 sets, the synthetic corpus generated using the pivot approach showed higher BLEU (19.11 / 20.45) than the back-translation counterpart (18.23 / 19.81) when used in training a De→Fr NMT model. Although the backtranslation method has been effective in many studies (Sennrich et al., 2015a, 2016), its availability becomes restricted in low-resource cases which is our major concern. This is due to the poor quality of the back-translation model built from the limited source-to-target parallel corpus. Instead, one can utilize abundant pivot-to-target parallel corpora by using a rich-resource language as the pivot language. This consequently improves the reliability of the quality of baseline translation models used for generating synthetic corpora."

      "text" : "From Table 2, we find that the bias of the synthetic examples in pseudo parallel corpora brings\nimbalanced quality in the bidirectional translation tasks. Given that the source- and target-originated classification of a specific synthetic corpus is reversed depending on the direction of the translation, the overall results imply that the targetoriginated corpus for each translation task outperforms the source-originated data. The preference of target-originated synthetic data over the sourceoriginated counterparts was formerly investigated in SMT by Lambert et al., (2011). In NMT, it can be explained by the degradation in quality in the source-originated data owing to the erroneous target language model formed by the synthetic target sentences. In contrast, we observe that PSEUDOmix not only produces balanced results for both Fr→De and De→Fr translation tasks but also shows the best or competitive translation quality for each task.\nWe note that mixing two different synthetic corpora leads to improved BLEU not their intermediate value. To investigate the cause of the improvement in PSEUDOmix, we build additional target-originated synthetic corpora for each Fr↔De translation with a beam of size 3. As shown in Table 3, for the De→Fr task, the new target-originated corpus (c) shows higher BLEU than the source-originated corpus (b) by itself. The improvement in BLEU, however, occurs only when mixing the source- and target-originated synthetic parallel data (b+d) compared to mixing two target-originated synthetic corpora (c+d). The same phenomenon is observed in the Fr→De case as well. The results suggest that real and synthetic sentences mixed on either side of sentence pairs enhance the capability of a synthetic parallel corpus. We conjecture that ground truth examples in both encoder and decoder networks not only compensate for the erroneous language model learned from synthetic sentences but also reinforces patterns of use latent in the pseudo sentences."

This result is slightly different from the previous case, where the target-originated synthetic corpus for each translation task reports better results than the source-originated data. This arises from the diversity in the source of each pseudo parallel corpus, which vary in their suitability for the given test set. Table 6 also shows that mixing the Cs*-De corpus with the Cs-De* corpus of worse quality brings improvements in the resulting PSEUDOmix, showing the highest BLEU for\nbidirectional Cs↔De translation tasks.

We thus enhance the quality of the synthetic examples of the source-originated Fr*-De data by further training its mother translation model (En→Fr). As illustrated in Figure 2, with the target-originated FrDe* corpus being fixed, the quality of the models trained with the source-originated Fr*-De data and PSEUDOmix increases in proportion to the quality of the mother model for the Fr*-De corpus.
