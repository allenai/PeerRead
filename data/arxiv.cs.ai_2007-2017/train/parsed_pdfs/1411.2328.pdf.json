      "text" : "Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) has been widely used in many different fields for its ability in capturing latent semantics in textual and image data. In standard LDA, the generating probability is estimated from a document-word matrix using word frequency information. One main disadvantage of LDA is that topic assignment of words is conditionally independent from each other and the relevance between vocabularies (i.e semantic similarity) is totally neglected. This inability makes LDA fall short in many aspects. For example, it is quite plausible that synonymous words such as \"use\" and \"utilize\", \"Chinese\" and \"China\" or \"politics\" and \"politicians\" should be generated from the same topic. However, standard LDA models treat them as independent units and if they do not co-appear in the same context, they can hardly be included in the same topic. An extreme case is cross-lingual topic modeling where words in different languages never co-occur with each other, though talking about same topics as they are.\nRecently, a number of attempts have been made to address the limitation due to conditional-independence. In cross-lingual topic extraction, researchers try to match word pairs and discover the correspondence aligned either at sentence level or document level [18, 16, 11, 12]. Zhao and Xing [18] incorporated word − pair, sentence − pair and document − pair knowledge information into statistical models. One disadvantage is that these approaches usually require aligned text corpus based on machine translation techniques.

However, these methods focus on cross-lingual techniques where word correlation is only partly considered.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the closest existing works are the approach developed by Andrzejewski et al. [2] and the approach developed by Petterson et al. [14] where word relations are considered. In Andrzejewski et al.’s work [2], domain knowledge is used to model vocabulary relations such as Must-Link or Cannot-Link. By applying a novel Dirichlet Tree prior, Must-Link words are more likely to be generated from the same topic and Cannot-Link are less likely. However, Andrzejewski et al.’s approach requires specific domain knowledge and can not be extended to general word correlation. In Petterson et al. ’s work[14], they use a sophisticated biased prior in Dirichlet distribution to consider the word correlations rather than the uniform one used in Standard LDA. One disadvantage is that their work considers word correlations only in the prior, but not in the algorithm.\nIn this paper, we propose an approach called Word Related Latent Dirichlet Allocation (WR-LDA) that incorporates word correlation into topic model. Given a collection of documents, standard LDA topic model wishes finding parameters by maximizing the marginal log likelihood of data. In our model, we sacrifice part of the maximization of log likelihood by incorporating vocabulary correlations based on the assumption that similar words tend to be generated from similar topics. We experiment our model on the different datasets and results indicate the effectiveness of model.\nSection 2 presents some related work and Section 3 presents our model. The remaining is the experiments and the conclusion."

      "text" : "Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [3] and PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) [5] have been widely used in many different fields such as social analysis [6, 8, 9], event detection [1, 13], text classification [10, 15] or facet mining [7, 17]. for their ability in discovering topics latent in the document collection. Standard topic models suffer the disadvantage that researchers only use word co-appearance frequency for topic modeling without considering word correlations. However similar or synonymous two terms are, if they do not co-appear in the document, they can hardly be classified into the same topic. This disadvantage is largely magnified in multi-lingual topic modeling where different languages never co-occur with each other.\nPrevious work on multilingual topic models mostly require parallelism at either the sentence level or document level [2] and the approach developed by Petterson et al. [14]. Boyd-Graber and Blei (2009) proposed a multilingual topic approach which requires a list of word pairs. Topic is defined as distribution over word pairs.

The disadvantage of their model is that their work take account of word correlations only in the prior, but not in the algorithm."

      "text" : "The Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model (Blei et al., 2003) defines the document likelihood using a hierarchical Bayesian scheme. Specifically, each document is presented as a mixture of topics which is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution and each topic is presented as a mixture of words. Document words are sampled from a topic-specific word distribution specified by a drawn of the wordtopic-assignment from the topic proportion vector. Let K be the number of topics; V be the number of the terms in a vocabulary. β is a K × V matrix and βk is the distribution vector over V terms where βij = P (w = j|zw = i) denotes the probability word w is generated from topic k. The generation for LDA is shown as follows: 1. For each document m ∈ [1,M ]: Draw topic proportion θm|α ∼ Dir(α) 2. For each word w 2.1 draw topic zw ∼Multinomial(θm) 2.2 draw w ∼ p(w|zw, β)\nLDA can be inferred from a collapsed Gibbes sampling (Heinrich 2005) or variational inference (Blei et al., 2003). Variational inference tries to find parameterα and β that maximize the (marginal) log likelihood of the data:\nL(α, β) = M∑ d=1 log(wd|α, β) (1)\nSince the posterior distribution of latent variables can not be computed efficiently, in variational inference of LDA, researchers use variational distribution q(θ, z|γ, φ) to approximate posterior distribution in each document.\nq(θ, z|γ, φ) = q(θm|γm) ∏ n q(zn|φn) (2)\nφn = {φn1, φn2, ..., φnK}. φnk can be interpreted as the probability that word at nth position in current document is generated from topic k. The next step is to set up an optimizing problem to determine the value of γ and φ where the desideratum of finding a tight lower bound on the log likelihood is transformed to the following optimization problem:\n(γ, φ) = argmin γ,φ\nKL(q(θ, z|γ, φ)||p(θ, z|w,α, β)) (3)\nwhere KL(p||q) denotes the KullbackLeibler (KL) divergence be-\ntween two distributions.\nL(γ, φ;α, β) =\nEq[log p(w|z, β)] + Eq[log p(z|θ)] + Eq[log p(θ|α)] − Eq[log q(θ)]− Eq[log q(z)]− Eq[log q(β)] (4)\n{α, β} can be iteratively inferred from variational EM algorithm (Blei et al., 2003)."

Let G = (V,E) denote the graph where V = {wi}i=Vi=1 denotes word collection and E = {ew,w′ : w ∈ V,w′ ∈ V }. e(w,w′) denotes the edge between nodew andw′. κw,w′ denotes the edge weight which is the similarity between word w and w′. Based on the assumption that similar words should have similar probability generated by different topics, we introduce the Loss function R(β), inspired by the idea of graph harmonic function (Zhu et al., 2003; Mei et al., 2008).\nR(β) = 1\n2 ∑ w ∑ w′ ∑ k κw,w′(βkw − βkw′)2 (5)\nIntuitively,R(β) measures the difference between p(w|β) and p(w′|β) for each pair (w,w′). The more similar two words are, the larger penalty there would be for distribution difference. Clearly, we prefer the topic distribution with smaller R(β).\nIn WR-LDA, we try to maximize function O(α, β) which is the combination of L(α, β) and −R(β) instead of just optimizing log likelihood L(α, β)1 in standard LDA.\nO(α, β) = λL(α, β)− (1− λ)R(β) (6)\nwhere λ is the parameter that balances the likelihood and loss function. When λ = 1, our model degenerates into standard LDA model. Similar idea can also been found in Zhang et al. (2010) for bilingual topic extraction and Mei et al.(2008) for topic network construction."

      "text" : "In this subsection, we describe the variational inference for WRLDA. We emphasize on the part that is different from LDA and briefly describe the part that is similar. We use the variational distribution q(θ, z|γ, φ) to approximate posterior distribution p(θ, z|w,α, β) and use variational EM algorithm for inference.\nE-step: The E-step of WR-LDA tries to find the optimizing values of the variational parameters {γ, φ}. Since the loss function R(β) does not involve γ and φ, E-step of WR-LDA is the same as that of standard LDA. We update {γ, φ} according to the following equations.\nφnk = βkwnexp{Eq[log(θk)|γ]} (7)\nγk = αk + ∑ n φnk (8)\nwhere Eq[log(θk)|γ] = Ψ(γk) − Ψ( ∑ k γk) and Ψ(·) is the first\nderivative of log Γ function. The E-step of WR-LDA is shown in Figure 2 (Blei et al., 2003).\n1The details of L(α, β) is shown in Appendix A.\nM-step: We try to maximizes the resulting lower bound ofO(α, β) shown in Equ.6 with respect to the model parameters α and β.\nUpdate β: By considering the Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the constraints that ∑ w βkw = 1 and ∑ k α m k = 1, we define T (α, β) as follows:\nT (α, β) = O(α, β) + ∑ k tk( ∑ w βkw − 1) + ∑ d td( ∑ k αmk − 1)\nSo given {γ, φ, λ} we have\n∂O(α, β)\n∂αk = 0\n∂T (α, β)\n∂βkw = 0 (9)\nIn LDA, β is updated in the M-step with βkw ∝ ∑ m ∑ n∈m φdnk1(wdn =\nw). However in WR-LDA, because of the incorporation of loss function R(β), the derivative of T (α, β) with respect to βkw depends on βkw′ , where w′ 6= w, as shown in Equ.10.\n∂T (α, β)\n∂βkw = λ\n1\nβkw ∑ m ∑ n∈m φdnk1(wdn = w)\n− 2(1− λ) ∑ w′ κw,w′(βkw − βkw′) + tk (10)\nTo achieve the optimal value of β, we use Newton-Raphson method for optimization. βk is a 1 × V vector. The update for βk in Newton-Raphson is as follows:\nβt+1k = β t k −H(βk)−1 5 T (βk) (11)\nwhere 5L(βk) is the gradient of function T (α, β) with regard to βkwi , i ∈ [1, V ]. H(βk) is a Hessian matrix.\nH(βk)(i, j) = ∂2T (α, β)\n∂βkwi∂βkwj = −2(1− λ)κwi,wj\n− λδ(i, j) β2kwi ∑ m ∑ n∈m φnk1(wn = wi)\n(12)\nIf the size of vocabulary V is 104,H(βk) would be a 104×104 matrix, the inverse of which would be too expensive to be calculated directly. To solve this problem, we adopt the strategy proposed in Mei et al.(2008)’s work, where we only need to find the value of βn that makes T (αn, βn|λn, φn, γn) > T (αn−1, βn−1|λn, φn, γn) instead of getting the local maximum of T (αn, βn|λn, φn, γn) at each M-step. In each iteration of M-step, we firstly set the value of βn,0 to the value which maximizes L(α, β), just as in Standard LDA.\nβn0kw ∝ ∑ m ∑ n∈m φdnk1(wdn = w) (13)\nThen we iteratively obtain βn,1, βn,2, ..., βn,t according to Equ.14 until the value of T (α, β) drops.\nβn,tkw = ρβ n,t−1 kw + (1− ρ)\n∑′ w κww′β\nn,t−1 kw′∑′\nw κww′ (14)\nClearly, ∑ w βkw = 1 and βkw ≥ 0 always hold in Equ.14. Equ.14 can be interpreted as follows: when ρ is set to 0, it means that the updating value of βkw is totally decided by its neighbors. In graph harmonic algorithm (zhu2003semi), Equ.14 is just the optimization of Lossfunction R(β) when ρ is set to 0. So we try to optimize O(α, β) by firstly decreasing the value of Lossfunction R(β) until O(α, β) decreases.\nupdate α: The first derivative of T (α, β) in regard with αk also depends on αk′ , k 6= k′, we also use Newton-Raphson method for optimization. Since the Hessian matrix H(α) is the form of:\nH(α) = diag(h) + 1z1T where hk = −MΨ′(αk) and z = MΨ′( ∑ k αk)the inverse of H(α) can be easily calculated (Blei et al., 2003):\nH−1(α) = diag(h)−1 − diag(h) −111Tdiag(h)−1 z−1 + ∑ k h −1 k\nα can be updated as follows:\nαt+1 = αt −H(α)−1 5 T (α) (15)\nMultiplying by the gradient, we easily obtain the ith component of matrix H(α)−1 5 T (α) (Blei et al., 2003).\n[H(α)−1 5 T (α)]i = [5T (α)]i − c\nhi (16)\nwhere c = ∑\nk[5T (α)]k/hk z−1+ ∑ k h −1 k"

As in Zhu and Xing (2010), we take logs of the response values to make them approximately normal. Each review is associated with an overall rating score and five aspect rating scores for the aspects: Value, Rooms, Location, Cleanliness, and Service. In this paper, we focus on predicting the overall rating scores for reviews.\nWe compare the results from the following approaches: LDA+SVR, sLDA, WR-LDA+SVR and sWR-LDA. For LDA+SVR and WCLDA+SVR, we use their low dimensional representation of documents as input features to a linear SVR and denote this method. The evaluation criterion is predictive R2 (pR2) as defined in the work of Blei and McAuliffe (2007).\nFigure 7 shows the predictive R2 scores of different models. First, since supervised topic models can leverage the side information (e.g., rating scores) to discover latent topic representations, they generally outperform the decoupled two-step procedure as adopted in unsupervised topic models. Secondly, we can see that sWR-LDA outperforms sLDA and WR-LDA+SVR outperforms LDA+SVR.\nFrom the top words of different topics shown at Fig8, we can easily explain why sWR-LDA is better than sLDA. For sWR-LDA, part of topics show a regular positiveness/negativeness pattern. Topic 3 is on the negative aspects of a hotel while Topic 7 and Topic 9 describe positive aspects. This is because word correlation is considered in WR-LDA. For example, positive vocabularies such as great, good and wonderful, they have similar semantic meanings and thus high edge weight. So they are very likely to be generated from the 3http://www.tripadvisor.com/\nsame topic. The topics discovered by LDA do not show a regular pattern on positiveness or negativeness, resulting in low predictive R2. Moreover, we can see that topics are more coherent in WRLDA. Topic 2 talks about sea sceneries, Topic 5 talks about food, Topic 6 talks about conditions of bathroom or swimming pool and Topic 10 talks about room objects. However, topics in LDA do not show such clear pattern."

WR-LDA1 is better than the DC model, which considers word correlations only in the prior construction, rather than in the algorithm. WR-LDA2, which consider word correlations fully, achieves better results than WR-LDA1, which partly considers word correlations.\nFor further illustration, we randomly choose two pairs of words, ”Messi”and ”梅西”(Messi in Chinese), which is the name of a famous Argentine soccer player, and ”China”and ”中国(China in Chinese)”. Since each pair of words have the same meaning, we prefer that they have the similar probabilities generated from the same topic. Figure 8 shows the probability that ”Messi”and ”梅 西”generated from different topics and Figure 9 shows ”China”and ”中国”. The x-axis is the index to the topic and y-axis is the loglikelihood of probability. We can see that in LDA, words within\nFigure 9: Comparison of topic distributions\neach pair are always negative correlated. This can be easily explained by the fact that Chinese words and English words never co-appear in a document. So if a Chinese word has large probability generated by one topic, it means this top is a Chinese dominated topic and most English words would be excluded. Word pairs in DC model are correlated but not as strong as that in WR-LDA. Since DC model models word correlation only in the prior, such influence can be diluted while Gibbs sampling goes on. In WR-LDA, word correlations are considered in the algorithm and during each iteration, algorithm will fix the gap between correlated words. That is why WR-LDA outperforms DC model."

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a model called Word Related Latent Dirichlet Allocation (WR-LDA) by incorporating word correlation into LDA topic models. This leads to new capabilities that standard LDA model does not have such as estimating infrequently occurring words or multi-language topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model compared with standard LDA.",
