      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Crossword puzzles are popular word games that require not only a large vocabulary, but also a broad knowledge of topics. Answering each clue is a natural language task on its own as many clues contain nuances, puns, or counter-intuitive word definitions. Additionally, it can be extremely difficult to find definitive answers without the constraints of the crossword grid itself. Completing some of the more difficult crossword puzzles can be a formidable task for many humans. Working in a natural language domain makes the task similarly challenging for computers.\nOne early system designed to solve crossword puzzles, Proverb [6], uses a variety of modules that targeted different types of clues and combined them into a probabilistic list in order to place them into the puzzle. Later, Dr. Fill [4] treats the crossword problem as a probabilistic constraint satisfaction problem and uses various lexical features to rank the candidate answers. IBM’s Watson [3] uses an enormous amount of computation power and engineering talent to successfully take on another difficult natural language game: Jeopardy!.\nCompared with other Question Answering systems, crossword solving systems are generally more complex, because of the following properties of crossword puzzles: [7]:\n• Clues are mostly formulated in a non-interrogative form.\n• Clues can be voluntarily ambiguous and misleading.\n• Topics of the questions are not limited to factoids.\n• There is a unique and precise answer which is a word or compound word, while in QA, the answer is a sequence of words in order to be recognizable by humans.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n02 36\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nN ov\n2 01\nThere are, however, some aspects which make crossword puzzles more approachable. Crosswords have a bias towards shorter and more common words, as well as words with specific letters and specific bigrams. Another advantage is that the length of the answer is known.\nWe propose a new crossword solving system, Cruciform, which has a general structure similar to that of Proverb and Dr. Fill. We employ a group of natural language components that each return a list of candidate words with likelihood scores when given a clue. The candidate lists for a clue are merged to form a single list; this is done for every clue. Then, these lists are used in conjunction with the fill intersections in the puzzle grid to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).\nWe performed all of our experiments on two months (June 2015 and July 2015) of New York Times puzzles to ensure reliable results. We show that filling in blanks using a vocabulary of answers and bigram reranking of generated solutions improves the baseline performance. Additionally, we propose a set of metrics to analyze each subcomponent of the overall crossword puzzle solver."

      "heading" : "2 New York Times Crossword Puzzles",
      "text" : "The New York Times (NYT) releases a new crossword puzzle daily1. Puzzles are submitted by puzzle composers, or cruciverbalists, to the editor of the daily puzzle. The puzzles progressively increase in difficulty throughout the week so Monday puzzles are the easiest and Saturday puzzles are the hardest, where each has a grid size of 15x15. The Sunday puzzle is roughly of the same difficulty as the Thursday puzzle, but is larger, typically with a size of 21x21. Each fill, or answer, is at least three letters long and all squares appear in exactly two words. Typically, the maximum word count for a Monday-Thursday puzzle is 78 words, 72 for a Friday or Saturday puzzle, and 140 words for a Sunday puzzle.\nThe NYT puzzles follow many additional set conventions. When a clue is an abbreviation or is tagged with with “abbr.”, the fill is also an abbreviation. If a clue is phrased as a question and ends in a question mark, then the answer is a play on words. Answers that are in non-English languages will have a clue that is either tagged with the language (ex. “Fr.” for French) or has a word from that language (e.g. “Month for Marcel” for “mai”). Clues and fills always match in part of speech, tense, number, and degree. The fill can consist of multiple words and will never appear in the clue corresponding to it. The first letter of a clue is always capitalized; this is sometimes used to introduce an ambiguity since there could be a significant difference between a word and the proper noun version of that word.\nSome puzzles are rebus puzzles, where some squares have to be filled with symbols, multiple letters, or a word. For instance, a rebus puzzle by Jeff Chen required the letters “pH” to be written together in single squares in fills such as “t/r/i/u/m/pH” and “s/o/pH/o/c/l/e/s.” These puzzles are often unique and require special rules to solve, so they are excluded from our analysis.\nBeyond these constraints, there are also a number of more qualitative elements that make up a quality crossword puzzle. Proper names that lack specific distinction (e.g. “girl’s name,” “boy’s name”) are generally avoided. Letter intersections where both words are unlikely to be solved by most readers are also discouraged."

      "text" : "The Dr. Fill system [4] starts with producing candidate answers for each clue. Candidate answers are extracted from various resources such as crossword databases, dictionaries, WordNet, and Wikipedia:\n• A crossword database from various publishers.\n• A small, basic dictionary containing common words.\n• An extensive dictionary with manually generated merit scores, where words with a higher score are considered good fill for crosswords. For example, “BUZZ LIGHTYEAR” is considered excellent fill. It is a lively word, uses uncommon letters, and has positive connotations.\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\n• Word roots and synonyms from WordNet.\n• Information like page titles Wikipedia.\nEach word of the appropriate length is scored by the following five criteria: 1) A match for the clue 2) Part of speech analysis 3) Crossword Merit 4) Abbreviation 5) Fill-in-the-blank. The final score is a weighted sum of the five criteria, where weights are tuned on a development set of puzzles.\nDr. Fill is evaluated (only) on the seven puzzles from the 2010 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT) using ACPT’s scoring rules to calculate a performance metric. However, it is not completely fair to use the ACPT score to compare their system with the other human solvers because the rules give bonus points for each minute of time remaining if a competitor finishes early. Since the rules were set for human solvers, we can expect that an automated system would finish solving puzzles much faster than humans and gain many extra points this way.\nSince quantitative results on other puzzles are not provided and the system is not publicly available, we are unable to compare directly against the Dr. Fill system."

It is important to note that if Dr.Fill simply chooses the best candidate to fill, the performance drops significantly.\n• Variable Selection: Pick the variable where the difference between the best candidate and the second best candidate is maximized.\n• Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS): The search maintains a list of discarded value choices. Each element of the list is a pair of (v, x) indicating the value v should not be proposed for x. Discarded elements are not considered in the Value and Variable Selection heuristics and remain discarded in the rest of the search. For additional details, see [4].\nThe overall CSP algorithm in Dr. Fill is outlined in Algorithm 1: Given a crossword puzzle C, a fixed discrepancy limit n, a partial solution S, the best solution so far B, and previously pitched assignments P , solve(C, S, B, n, P ) gives the best solution extending S with at most n discrepancies.\nAlgorithm 1 Dr. Fill CSP Algorithm procedure SOLVE(C, S,B, n, P )\nif cost(S) ≥ cost(B) then return B if S assigns a value to every variable then return S v ← a variable unassigned by S d← an element of v’s domain such that (v, d) /∈ P S′← S ∪ (v = d) C ′← propagate(C,S′) if propagation succeeded then\nB ← solve(C ′, S′, B, n, P ) if |P | < n then\nB ← solve(C, S, B, n, P ∪ (v, d))"

Using a novel Web Search Module (WSM), the system extracts potential words from web documents and ranks them using various filters. After parsing the document and identifying an unweighted list of candidate words, they are passed through both a statistical filter and a morphological filter. The statistical filter determines a score based on the distance between the candidate words and the search query. The morphological filter is composed of two parts, one of which attempts to determine the morphological class of each word in the document, while the other component identifies the most likely morphological classes of the clue’s answer. The words are also ranked by a fairly standard crossword database module, a hard coded rule based module, a dictionary, and other similar modules. These scores are then merged additively by word and weighted by the confidence of each module. The grid is then filled by a CSP version of WA*.\nThe WebCrow system is evaluated on Italian crossword puzzles and not on English language puzzles. The structure and methodology for designing crossword puzzles varies a lot from one language to another. For instance, Italian puzzles can have letters that don’t participate in crosses and include two letter fills that aren’t actual words. Without running Webcrow on English crossword puzzles, we cannot determine how well the system would generalize to these puzzles or make a direct comparison with our system."

One of these features takes basic statistics the feature values of all such clues as determined by the reranking modules, as well as the frequency of the answer in the crossword database. The occurrences of each answer instance are modeled by a vector the size of the clue list with the values corresponding to the position in each clue’s candidate list or zero if the word is not present. Additionally, the system attempts to determine the similarity between answer candidates and input clues using features based on word embeddings. These features are determined by (i) the similarity between the pair of clues, (ii) the target clue and the candidate answer and (iii) the candidate clue and the candidate answer. The end result is a reranked and aggregated list which can be input into WebCrow’s CSP solver after a logistic regression step."

After merging the answers from different components, we compile a list of candidate answers along with confidence scores. These answers are then used to formulate a CSP solved by the algorithm similar to Dr.Fill (Section 4.2.2). Specifically, the CSP algorithm uses a variable selection heuristic by choosing the variable with the maximum confidence score difference between the best candidate and the second best candidate and then choosing that variable’s best candidate following the value selection heuristic. To introduce some variations, the CSP algorithm also searches with non-best values with a predefined depth limit. The CSP search procedure generates a number of solutions (typically around 20) for the whole puzzle. We then refine each solution with post-processing steps including filling in the blanks and bigram probability reranking (Section 4.3)."

The task of each component is to recognize a specific clue type, understand the clue in some way, and provide an (optionally) ranked list of candidate answers that are the correct length to be placed into the puzzle.\nThe input to each component consists of a list of all clues in a puzzle along with the clue ID (e.g., 1A, 2D, 3A. . . ) and the length of the correct answer, which is inferred from the puzzle grid layout. The output of each component is a list of candidate answers for each clue, designated with the corresponding clue ID as well as a score indicating the quality of the answer produced.

Each constraint is a tuple (scope, rel), where scope contains a list of the variables affected by the constraints, and rel describes the restrictions enforced by the constraint.\nIn the case of a crossword puzzle, let X be the set of entries in the puzzle that must be filled, where each entry Xi has exactly one clue and one correct answer. Both the length of the correct answer, `(Xi), and the constraints, C, can be inferred from examining the puzzle grid layout. Each Ci defines an intersection between two answers (scope) in the puzzle, one in the ”across” direction and the other in the ” down” direction, where rel states that either 1) the letter in the square of the intersection must be the same, or 2) at least one of the two variables currently has a ”blank” square in the location of the intersection.

Every candidate word has some score reflecting how likely it is for the given clue. These are provided by the NLP components.\nFor the algorithm to choose the next variable, we employ the following variable selection heuristic: choose the variable that has the largest difference between the confidence scores of the best and second best candidates. This difference indicates how confident we are in filling that variable. For our value selection heuristic, we choose the candidate with the highest score. However, the best candidate is not always the correct answer and always choosing the candidate with the highest score can lead to poor solutions. To work around this problem, we also implemented Limited Discrepancy Search, where “discrepancy” is defined as the number of times that the heuristic is violated. We use LDS with a value selection heuristic where non-best candidates are also chosen.

The evaluation is obtained from NYT puzzles from June 2015. As we can see, Lucene components achieve high attempt ratios around 97%, indicating that it attempts to answer most clues. Lucene CWG and OTSYS have high MRAR and AP, while Lucene Wiki has much lower numbers."

      "text" : "To examine the CSP system portion specifically, we compute the following performance statistics:\n• FromComponents - This is the percentage of clues where the correct word is present in at least one of the component candidate lists.\n• AverageRank - This is the average rank of the correct word in the final candidate list for CSP if it was produced for a clue.\n• IntoCSP - This is the percentage of correct words presented by the components that are placed into the final candidate list for CSP.\n• IntoSolution- This is the percentage of correct words in the candidate list for CSP that are placed into the solution by CSP.\nHere, FromComponents provides an overview of the quality of candidate answers generated by different components. AverageRank and IntoCSP quantify the input quality of CSP, while IntoSolution evaluates the quality of CSP algorithm itself. A good CSP algorithm will pick out correct answers from the input candidate lists, resulting in a small gap between IntoCSP and IntoSolution.\nTable 6 summarizes our evaluation of the CSP algorithm’s performance on the NYT June 2015 and July 2015 puzzles. For Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday puzzles, the CSP algorithm demonstrates strong performance even though the Average Rank is around 10. However, as the difficulty of puzzles increases for the following weekdays, the Average Rank surges to 25, which lowers the CSP algorithm’s performance."

One can also choose which candidate generation components will be used by the solver. When a puzzle is loaded, both the empty and correctly filled grids are displayed, along with all of the clues. The empty grid is filled with the generated solution after the puzzle has been solved. Evaluation results such as square and word accuracy are also displayed. Figure 4 fives an output example for our interface.\n5http://clair.si.umich.edu/crossword2015/"

We employ a group of natural language components that each return a list of candidate words with likelihood scores when given a clue. Then, these lists are used in conjunction with the fill intersections in the puzzle grid to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Additional stages, such as fill-in-the-blanks using bigram probabilities, round out the components of the system."

    "abstractText" : "Crossword puzzles are popular word games that require not only a large vocabulary, but also a broad knowledge of topics. Answering each clue is a natural language task on its own as many clues contain nuances, puns, or counter-intuitive word definitions. Additionally, it can be extremely difficult to ascertain definitive answers without the constraints of the crossword grid itself. This task is challenging for both humans and computers. We describe here a new crossword solving system, Cruciform. We employ a group of natural language components, each of which returns a list of candidate words with scores when given a clue. These lists are used in conjunction with the fill intersections in the puzzle grid to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem, in a manner similar to the one used in the Dr. Fill system[4]. We describe the results of several of our experiments with the system.",
