      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "There is growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to historical texts (Piotrowski, 2012), with applications in information retrieval (Dougherty, 2010; Jurish, 2011), linguistics (Baron et al., 2009; Rayson et al., 2007), and the digital humanities (Hendrickx et al., 2011; Pettersson and Nivre, 2011). However, these texts differ from contemporary training corpora in a number of linguistic respects, including the lexicon (Giusti et al., 2007), morphology (Borin\nand Forsberg, 2008), and syntax (Eumeridou et al., 2004). This imposes significant challenges for modern NLP tools: for example, the accuracy of the CLAWS part-of-speech Tagger (Garside and Smith, 1997) drops from 97% on the British National Corpus to 82% on Early Modern English texts (Rayson et al., 2007). There are two main approaches that could improve the accuracy of NLP systems on historical texts: normalization and domain adaptation.\nNormalization Spelling normalization (also called canonicalization) involves mapping historical spellings to their canonical forms in modern languages, thus bridging the gap between contemporary training corpora and target historical texts. Figure 1 shows one historical sentence and its normalization by VARD (Baron and Rayson, 2008), a variant detector tool. Rayson et al. (2007) report an increase of about 3% accuracy on adaptation of POS tagging from Modern English texts to Early Modern English texts if the target texts were automatically normalized by the VARD system. However, normalization is not always a well-defined problem (Eisenstein, 2013), and it does not address the full range of linguistic changes over time, such as unknown words, morphological differences, and changes in the meanings of words (Kulkarni et al., 2015). In the example above, the word ‘ryottours’\nis not successfully normalized to ‘rioters’; the syntax is comprehensible to contemporary English speakers, but usages such as ‘wild disposed’ and ‘drew unto’ are sufficiently unusual as to pose problems for NLP systems trained on contemporary texts.\nDomain adaptation A more generic machine learning approach is to apply unsupervised domain adaptation techniques, which transform the representations of the training and target texts to be more similar, typically using feature co-occurrence statistics (Blitzer et al., 2006; Ben-David et al., 2010). It is natural to think of historical texts as a distinct domain from contemporary training corpora, and Yang and Eisenstein (2014, 2015) show that the accuracy of historical Portuguese POS tagging can be significantly improved by domain adaption; however, we are unaware of prior work that empirically evaluates the efficacy of this approach on Early Modern English texts. Furthermore, historical texts are often associated with multiple metadata attributes (e.g., author, genre, and epoch), each of which may influence the text’s linguistic properties. Multi-domain adaptation (Mansour et al., 2009) and multi-attribute domain adaptation (Joshi et al., 2013; Yang and Eisenstein, 2015) can potentially exploit these metadata attributes to obtain further improvements.\nThis paper presents the first comprehensive empirical comparison of effectiveness of these approaches for part-of-speech tagging on historical texts. We focus on the two historical treebanks of the Penn Corpora of Historical English — the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (Kroch et al., 2010, PPCMBE) and the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (Kroch et al., 2004, PPCEME). These datasets enable a range of analyses, which isolate the key issues in dealing with historical corpora:\n• In one set of analyses, we focus on the PPCMBE and the PPCEME corpora, training on more recent texts and testing on earlier texts. This isolates the impact of language change on tagging performance. • In another set of analyses, we train on the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993, PTB), and test on the historical corpora, using the tag map-\npings from Moon and Baldridge (2007). Our evaluation includes the well-known Stanford CoreNLP tagger (Manning et al., 2014), thus replicating the most typical situation for users of existing language technology. • We show that FEMA, a domain adaptation algorithm that is specifically designed for sequence labeling problems (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015), achieves an increase of nearly 4% accuracy when adapting from the PTB to the PPCEME. • We compare the impact of normalization with domain adaptation, and demonstrate that they are largely complementary. • Error analysis shows that the improvements obtained by domain adaptation are largely due to better handling of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens. Many of the most frequent errors on in-vocabulary (IV) tokens are caused by mismatches in the tagsets or annotation guidelines, and may be difficult to address without labeled data in the target domain."

      "heading" : "2 Data",
      "text" : "The Penn Corpora of Historical English consist of the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English, second edition (Kroch and Taylor, 2000, PPCME2), the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English (PPCEME), and the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English (PPCMBE). The corpora are annotated with part-of-speech tags and syntactic parsing trees in an annotation style similar to that of the PTB. In this work, we focus on POS tagging the PPCMBE and the PPCEME.1\nThe Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English The PPCMBE is a syntactically annotated corpus of text, containing 948,895 words sampled from the period 1700-1914. It is divided into three 70-year time periods according to the composition date of the works. In contrast to the PTB, the PPCMBE contains text from a variety of genres, such as Bible, Drama, Fiction, and Letters.\n1Middle English is outside the scope of this paper, because it is sufficiently unintelligible to modern English speakers that texts such as Canterbury Tales are published in translation (e.g., Chaucer and Hopper, 2012). In tagging Middle English texts, Moon and Baldridge (2007) apply bitext projection techniques from multilingual learning, rather than domain adaptation.\nThe Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early Modern English The PPCEME is a collection of text samples from the Helsinki Corpus as well as two supplements to the Helsinki Corpus, which consist of text material by the same authors and from the same editions as the material in the Helsinki Corpus. The corpus contains 1,737,853 words spanning from 1500 until 1710, and it is divided into three 70- year time periods similar to the PPCMBE corpus. The PPCEME consists of text from the same eighteen genres as the PPCMBE.\nPenn Treebank Release 3 The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) is the de facto standard syntactically annotated corpus for English, which is used to train software such as Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014). When using this dataset for supervised training, we follow Toutanova et al. (2003) and use WSJ sections 0-18 for training, and sections 19-21 for tuning. When applying unsupervised domain adaptation, we use all WSJ sections, together with texts from the PPCMBE and the PPCEME.\nTagsets The Penn Corpora of Historical English (PCHE) use a tagset that differs from the Penn Treebank, mainly in the direction of greater specificity. Auxiliary verbs ‘do’, ‘have’, and ‘be’ all have their own tags, as do words like ‘one’ and ‘else’, due to their changing syntactic function over time. Overall, there are 83 tags in the PPCEME, and 81 in the PPCMBE, as compared with 45 in the PTB. Furthermore, the tags in the PCHE tagset are allowed to join constituent morphemes in compounds, yielding complex tags such as PRO+N (e.g., ‘himself’) and ADJ+NS (e.g., ‘gentlemen’).\nIn order to measure the tagging accuracy of PTBtrained taggers on the historical texts, we follow Moon and Baldridge (2007), who define a set of deterministic mappings from the PCHE tags to the PTB tagset. For simplicity, we first convert each complex tag to the simple form by only considering the first simple tag component (e.g., PRO+N to PRO and ADJ+NS to ADJ). The conversion has little effect on the tagging performance, as the complex tags only cover slightly more than 1% of the tokens in the PCHE treebanks. Among the 83 tags, 74 mappings to the corresponding PTB tags are obtained from Moon and Baldridge (2007). We did our best\nto convert the other tags according to the tag description. For example, $ is mapped to PRP$, WARD is mapped to VB, and each punctuation tag is mapped to its identical tag. The complete list of mappings will be published in an appendix."

      "heading" : "3 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation",
      "text" : "In typical usage scenarios, the user wants to tag some historical text but has no labeled data in the target domain (e.g., Muralidharan and Hearst, 2013). This best fits the paradigm of unsupervised domain adaptation, when labeled data from the source domain (e.g., the PTB) is combined with unlabeled data from the target domain. Representational differences between source and target domains can be a major source of errors in domain adaptation (BenDavid et al., 2010), and so several representation learning approaches have been proposed.\nThe most straightforward approach is to replace lexical features with word representations, such as Brown clusters (Brown et al., 1992; Lin et al., 2012) or word embeddings (Turian et al., 2010). This can assist in domain adaptation by linking out-ofvocabulary words to in-vocabulary words with similar distributional properties.\nA more general solution is Structural Correspondence Learning (Blitzer et al., 2006, SCL), in which we create artificial binary classification problems for thousands of cross-domain “pivot” features, and then use the weights from the resulting classifiers to project the instances into a new dense representation. This is similar to the (later) idea of skipgram word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013, word2vec), but can be applied to arbitrary features.\nWe also consider a recently-published approach called Feature Embedding (FEMA), which achieves the state-of-the-art results on several POS tagging adaptation tasks (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015). The intuition of FEMA is similar to prior work: it relies on co-occurrence statistics to link features across domains. Specifically, FEMA exploits the tendency of many NLP tasks to divide features into templates, and induces feature embeddings by using the features in each template to predict the active features in all other templates — just as the skipgram model learns word embeddings to predict neighboring words.\nA further advantage of FEMA is that it can perform multi-attribute domain adaptation, enabling it to exploit the many metadata attributes (e.g., year, genre, and author) that are often associated with historical texts. This is done by accounting for the specific impact of each domain attribute on the feature predictors, and then building a domain-neutral representation from the common substructure that is shared across all domain attributes. In the experiments that follow, we use genre and epoch as domain attributes."

      "text" : "We evaluate these unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on part-of-speech tagging for historical English (the PPCMBE and the PPCEME), in two settings: (1) temporal adaptation within each individual corpus, where we train POS taggers on the most modern data in the corpus and test on increasingly distant datasets; (2) adaptation of English POS tagging from modern news text to historical texts. The first setting focuses on temporal differences, and eliminates other factors that may impair tagging performance, such as different annotation schemes and text genres. The second setting is the standard and well-studied evaluation scenario for POS tagging, where we train on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text from the PTB and test on historical texts. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of the VARD normalization tool (Baron and Rayson, 2008) for improving POS tagging performance on the PPCEME corpus."

There are three broad types of templates: five lexical feature templates, eight affix feature templates, and three orthographic feature templates."

The domain adaptation models are trained on the union of the source and target datasets. Following Yang and Eisenstein (2015), we do not learn feature embeddings for the three orthographic feature templates: as each orthographic feature template represents only a binary value, it is unnecessary to replace it with a much longer numerical vector. The learned representations are then concatenated with the basic surface features to form the augmented representations. For computational reasons, the domain adaptation systems are all based on the SVM tagger; pilot studies showed that Viterbi tagging offers only minimal improvements."

We empirically fix the number of singular vectors of the projection matrix K to 25, and also employ feature normalization and rescaling, as these settings yield best performance in prior work. The number of Brown clusters is chosen from {50, 100, 200, 400}. For FEMA and word2vec, we choose embedding sizes from {50, 100, 200, 300} and fix the numbers of negative samples to 15. The window size for training word embeddings is set as\n2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\n5. Finally, we adopt the same regularization penalty for all the attribute-specific embeddings of FEMA, which is selected from {0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0}.

      "heading" : "4.2 Temporal Adaptation",
      "text" : "In the temporal adaptation setting, we work within each corpus, training on the most recent section, and evaluating on the two earlier sections. For PPCMBE, the source domain is the period from 1840 to 1914; for PPCEME, the source domain is the period from 1640 to 1710. All earlier texts are treated as target domains. We transform the tags to the PTB tagset for evaluation, so that results can be compared with the next experiment, in which the PTB is used for supervision.\nSettings We randomly sample 10% sentences from the training data as the development data for optimizing hyperparameters, and then retrain the models on the full training data using the best parameters. For FEMA, we consider domain attributes for 70-year temporal periods and genres, resulting in a total of 21 attributes for each corpus. The numbers of pivot features used in SCL are 4400 and 5048 for the PPCMBE and the PPCEME respectively. The best number of Brown clusters is 200, and the best embedding sizes are 200 and 100 for word2vec and FEMA.\nResults As shown in Table 1, accuracies are significantly improved by domain adaptation, es-\npecially for the PPCEME. English spelling had become mostly uniform and stable since around 1700 (Baron et al., 2009), which may explain why improvements on the PPCMBE are relatively modest, especially in the 1770-1839 epoch. Among the two baseline systems, MEMM performs slightly better than SVM, showing a small benefit to structured prediction. Among the domain adaptation algorithms, FEMA clearly outperforms SCL, Brown clustering and word2vec, with an averaged increase of about 0.5% and 1.5% accuracies on the PPCMBE and the PPCEME test sets respectively. The metadata attribute information boosts performance by a small but consistent margin, 0.1-0.2% on average."

      "heading" : "4.3 Adaptation from the Penn Treebank",
      "text" : "Newspaper text is the primary data source for training modern NLP systems. For example, most of “off-the-shelf” English POS taggers (e.g., Stanford Tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003), SVMTool (Giménez and Marquez, 2004), and CRFTagger (Phan, 2006)) are trained on the WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, which is composed of professionally-written news text from 1989. This motivates this evaluation scenario, in which we train the tagger on the Penn Treebank WSJ data and apply it to historical English texts, using all sentences of the PPCMBE and PPCEME for testing.\nSettings The domain attributes for FEMA are set to include the three corpora themselves (PTB, PPCMBE, and PPCEME), and the genre attributes in the historical corpora. Note that all sentences in the Penn Treebank WSJ data belong to the same\ngenre (news). For SCL, we use the same threshold of 50 occurrences for pivot features, and include 8089 features that pass this threshold. PTB WSJ sections 19-21 are used for parameter tuning: we find that the best number of Brown clusters is 200, and the optimum embedding sizes are 200 and 100 for word2vec and FEMA.\nSpelling normalization Spelling variants lead to a high percentage of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens in historical texts, which poses problems for POS tagging. We normalize the PPCEME sentences using VARD (Baron and Rayson, 2008), a widely used spelling normalization tool that has been proven to improve performance on POS tagging (Rayson et al., 2007) and syntactic parsing (Schneider et al., 2014). VARD is designed specifically for Early Modern English spelling variation, and additional labeled data and training are required for other forms of spelling variation, which we do not consider here. Following Schneider et al. (2014), we utilize VARD’s auto-normalization function with a 50% normalization threshold, achieving a balance between precision and recall. At this threshold, a total of 12% (236298/1961157) of the tokens in the PPCEME are normalized.3\nResults As shown in Table 2, this task is considerably more difficult, with even the best systems achieving accuracies that are nearly 15% worse than in-domain training. Nonetheless, domain adaptation can help: FEMA improves performance by 1.3% on the PPCMBE data, and by 3.8% on the unnormalized PPCEME data. Spelling normalization also helps, improving the baseline systems by more than 2.5%. The combination of spelling normalization and domain adaptation gives an overall improvement in accuracy from 74.2% to 79.1%.\n3We only consider 1 : 1 mappings, and ignore 328 normalizations corresponding to 1 : n mappings."

However, the PPCEME is also more amenable to domain adaptation, with FEMA offering considerably larger improvements. One reason is that the PPCEME has many more out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens: 23%, versus 9.2% in the PPCMBE. Both domain adaptation and normalization help to address this specific issue, and they yield further improvements when used in combination. This section offers further insights on the sources of errors and possibilities for improvement on the PPCEME data."

The results show that the word context features are important for obtaining good accuracies on both IV and OOV tokens. If we drop the affix features, the accuracy decreases significantly on OOV tokens. The suffix features are more crucial than the prefix features, as many of them can determine the POS tags of English words with high precisions. The orthographic features are shown to be nearly irrelevant. Overall, the high percentage of OOV tokens can be a major source of errors, as the tagging accuracy on OOV tokens is below 50% in our best baseline system. Note that these results are for a classification-based tagger; while the Viterbi-based MEMM tagger performs only marginally better overall (∼ 0.2% improvement), it is possible that its error distribution might be different due to the advantages of structured prediction."

      "heading" : "5.2 Error Analysis",
      "text" : "We believe the low accuracy on in-vocabulary (IV) tokens is largely caused by the different annotation schemes between the PTB and the PPCEME. Table 4 presents the SVM accuracy per tag, and the most common error correspondingly. Most of the errors shown in the table are owing to different annotations of the same token in the two corpora. For example, more than 99.9% of token ‘to’ are labeled as TO in the PTB, but only 54.6% of the token are labeled as TO in the PPCEME and 44.3% of them are labeled as IN (P in the PCHE tagset). The words ‘all’, ‘any’ and ‘every’ are annotated as quantifiers in the PPCEME, which are mapped to JJ, while they are all labeled as DT in the PTB. A simple remapping from Q to DT leads to an increase of 0.78% baseline accuracy; it is possible that other changes to the tag mappings of Moon and Baldridge (2007) might yield further improvements, but a more systematic approach would be outside the bounds of unsupervised domain adaptation.\nA major source of errors on OOV tokens is spelling variation. For instance, ‘ye’ and ‘thy’, the older forms of ‘the’ and ‘your’, are often incorrectly tagged as NN and JJ in the PPCEME. In general, the per-tag accuracies are roughly correlated with the percentages of OOV tokens. Some exceptions including VB, NNP and NNS, where the affix features can be very useful for tagging OOV tokens."

After normalization, the OOV rate for the PPCEME\nfalls from 23.0% to 13.5%, corresponding to a reduction of 41.5% OOV tokens. Normalization is not perfectly accurate, and the tagging performance for IV tokens drops slightly to 81.2% on IV tokens. But due to the dramatic decrease in the number of OOV tokens, normalization improves the overall accuracy by more than 2.5%. We also observe performance drops on tagging OOV tokens after normalization (49.0% to 48.1%), which suggests that the remaining unnormalized OOV tokens are the tough cases for both normalization and POS tagging."

Compared against the baseline tagger, FEMA-attribute achieves an absolute improvement of 14% in accuracy on OOV tokens. SCL performs slightly better than Brown clustering and word2vec on IV tokens, but worse on OOV tokens. By incorporating metadata attributes, FEMA-attribute performs better than FEMA-single on OOV tokens, though the accuracies on IV tokens are similar. Interestingly, the venerable method of Brown clustering (slightly) outperforms both word2vec and SCL.\nWe further study the relationship between domain adaptation and spelling normalization by look-\ning into the errors corrected by both approaches. Domain adaptation yields larger improvements than spelling normalization on both IV and OOV tokens, although as noted above, the approaches are somewhat complementary. The results show that among the 60,928 error tokens corrected by VARD, 60% are also corrected by FEMA-attribute, while the remaining 40% would be left uncorrected by the domain adaptation technique. Conversely, among the errors corrected by FEMA-attribute, 38% are also corrected by VARD. The overlap of reduced errors is because of both approaches exploit similar sources of information, including affixes and local word contexts."

      "text" : "Domain adaptation Early work on domain adaptation focuses on supervised setting, in which some amount of labeled instances are available in the target domain (Jiang and Zhai, 2007; Daumé III, 2007; Finkel and Manning, 2009). Unsupervised domain adaptation is more challenging but attractive in many applications, and several representation learning methods have been proposed for addressing this problem. Structural Correspondence Learning (Blitzer et al., 2006, SCL) and marginalized denoising autoencoders (Chen et al., 2012, mDA) seek cross-domain representations that are useful to predict a subset of features in the original instances, called pivot features. More recent work trains crossdomain representations with neural networks, with additional objectives such as minimizing errors in the source domain and maximizing domain confusion loss (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2015; Tzeng et al., 2015). We show the Feature Embedding model, which is specifically designed for NLP problems with feature templates (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015), achieves strong performance on historical adapta-\ntion tasks.\nHistorical texts Historical texts differ from modern texts in spellings, syntax and semantics, posing significant challenges for standard NLP systems, which are usually trained with modern news text. Numerous resources have been created for overcoming the difficulties, including syntactically annotated corpora (Kroch et al., 2004; Kroch et al., 2010; Galves and Faria, 2010) and spelling normalization tools (Giusti et al., 2007; Baron and Rayson, 2008). Most previous work focuses on normalization, which can significantly increase tagging accuracy on historical English (Rayson et al., 2007) and German (Scheible et al., 2011). Similar improvements have been obtained for syntactic parsing (Schneider et al., 2014). Domain adaptation offers an alternative approach which is more generic — for example, it can be applied to any corpus without requiring the design of a set of normalization rules. As shown above, when normalization is possible, it can be combined with domain adaptation to yield better performance than that obtained by either approach alone."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Building NLP systems that are robust to language variation is crucial if natural language processing is to be successfully employed in historical texts. Domain adaptation techniques have been widely adopted in similar problems but seldom used in this application. We empirically evaluate several unsupervised domain adaptation approaches on POS tagging of historical English texts. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation methods significantly improve the tagger performance on two historical English treebanks. FEMA outperforms other domain adaptation approaches with large margins, and it also performs better than a spelling normalization system. Normalization and domain adaptation combine to yield even better performance, with a total of 5% raw accuracy improvement over a baseline classifier in the most difficult setting. We also analyze common errors and point out that more work need to be done for resolving the inconsistent annotations. We hope that our work encourages the research on domain adaptation for historical texts and provide useful baselines in these efforts."

    "abstractText" : "With the rise of digital humanities research, natural language processing for historical texts is of increasing interest. However, directly applying standard language processing tools to historical texts often yields unsatisfactory performance, due to language change and genre differences. Spelling normalization is the dominant solution, but it fails to account for changes in usage and vocabulary. In this empirical paper, we assess the capability of domain adaptation techniques to cope with historical texts, focusing on the classic benchmark task of part-of-speech tagging. We empirically evaluate several domain adaptation methods on the task of tagging two millionword treebanks of the Penn Corpora of Historical English. We demonstrate that domain adaptation significantly outperforms spelling normalization when adapting modern taggers to older texts, and that domain adaptation is complementary with spelling normalization, yielding better results in combination.",
