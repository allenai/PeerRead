      "text" : "Supposedly we all can see roughly the same things if we look at the same things. This subjective observation naturally suggests that there are similar analytical capabilities and processes in our brain. From the point of view of cognitivism, we have similar cognitive architecture and the mental programs that are running in our brain are the same. But we certainly have no direct experience of other persons’ mental processes. This was also emphasized by Eugene Wigner in [16] where it was pointed out that “our knowledge of the consciousness of other men is derived only through analogy and some innate knowledge”. But what is being sensed by human consciousness? It is the common-sense. The elements of it have been detected by consciousness. The existence of common-sense can be seen as the fruit of cooperation of human minds. At present, it is a popular research field to build databases similar to human common-sense (see, for example the projects Open Mind Common Sense and ConceptNet[7] or WordNet[4] and Cyc[6]) in order to computer programs also will be able to use common-sense knowledge. But while collaboration between computers is a fully well-known area due to it is based on such protocols that were developed by engineers, cooperation between human minds is an open and interdisciplinary research field and there is even the possibility that spoken and written communication are merely apparent where speech and reading/writing processes may mask the real channel that is based on biological quantum teleportation[9]. A similar kind of situation may be\n∗batfai.norbert@inf.unideb.hu, Department of Information Technology, University of Debrecen, H-4010 Debrecen PO Box 12, Hungary\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n03 78\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nM ar\n2 01\n5\nobserved in the case of communication between computers where several virtual communication layer protocols are built on the real physical link[14].\nIf strong AI[13] is true, then in principle, there might be algorithms that can compute all conscious and unconscious decisions of our life, at least theoretically. For a long time we had been believing that it cannot be possible because a computer program cannot be rich enough to describe such kind of complex behavior. But this assumption is completely wrong because it is tacitly based on investigating the source code of computer programs that have been directly designed and written by human programmers. To provide an intuitive counterexample of how complex the behavior of a computer program may be, consider the 5-state Busy Beaver[12] champion Turing machine discovered by Marxen and Buntrock[8]. This machine can execute many millions of steps before halting. The operation of it represents such level of complexity that cannot be achieved by using human programmers directly. That is, these and similar machines have not been created directly by human programmers, they have been only discovered by mankind[1].\nCan the physical, chemical, and biological processes behind consciousness be considered to be similar, for example, to the Busy Beaver programs with complex behavior? They definitely can be, in the sense that these natural processes show complex behavior and the aim of natural sciences is precisely to uncover such processes. Unfortunately, we cannot provide any new recipes for discovering and uncovering these mysteries. But in this paper we will try to find sets of the simplest computer programs (aka Turing machines) whose members can perform complex and meaningful communication and cooperation among each other. We suppose that such machines exist and we are going to try to uncover them.\nNeumann wrote in his last unfinished book [11] that “It is only proper to realize that language is a largely historical accident.” The same might also be true for consciousness. In our view the minds are complex programs that can communicate and cooperate with each other where the cooperation is so important that consciousness cannot exist in itself. For this reason, developing some isolated standalone consciousness cannot be successful. Therefore, in the spirit of Chaitin’s quote “To me, you understand something only if you can program it. (You, not someone else!) Otherwise you dont really understand it, you only think you understand it.”[3] we would like to develop “networks” of cooperating computer programs, but we are not going to try to create these from scratch because it seems almost impossible at this moment. Instead, we are going to find existing computer programs that can cooperate with each other by a given orchestrated model."

      "text" : "chines\nIn intuitive sense, we call Turing machines that have the ability to cooperate with each other by using some kind of algorithms like Alg. 1, Alg. 4 or Alg. 5 orchestrated machines (OMs). The idea behind these algorithms is to modify the original operation of Turing machines in order to evolve some collective behavior. The name orchestrated machines is partly inspired by the Penrose – Hameroff Orchestrated Objective Reduction (OrchOR) model of quantum consciousness [5]. The flavor of our algorithms in question is reminiscent of the dynamics of Neumann’s U and R processes [15] and of the dynamics of the intuitive cellular automata example of [5] in sense that one transition rule is chosen non-deterministically from applicable rules (R) then this selected rule will be executed in all Turing machines (U), and so on.\nThe first orchestrated algorithm (OM1) is shown in pseudocode in Alg. 1. It is intended to be applied in computer simulations of cooperation among Turing machines. Accordingly, this algorithm uses Turing machines that have no input. The second algorithm is given in pseudocode in Alg. 4, it may be used for study of standard questions such as, “What is the language recognized by an orchestrated machine?” Finally Alg. 5 gives higher autonomy to individual Turing machines in their operation. It may be noted that all three algorithms can be considered as a special universal Turing machine."

      "text" : "The complete pseudo code for orchestrated machines is shown in Alg. 1. As input, the algorithm gets a set of Turing machines. The initial state of the orchestrated machine is that the heads of the contained Turing machines are reading zero and the machines are in their initial state which is 0. The operation of the algorithm is controlled by the variable F ∈ QG×{0, 1} initialized in Line 3. In the main loop in Line 4, every machines G ∈Mn determine the transition rule F → T ∈ fG that can be applicable to actual value of F . If a machine G has no such rule, then it halts and will be removed from the orchestrated machine in Line 10. The main loop collects the right side of applicable rules of the machines G ∈ Mn into the set U in Line 8 (the implementation uses a list instead of a set). After the inner loop is exited, only one right side will be non-deterministically chosen to be executed on all machines where it is\npossible as shown from Line 13 to 16. The orchestrated machine halts if all contained Turing machines halt.

The statement holds trivially for the case n = 0 because tapes contain only zeros doe to the machines were started with no input. 2. The tapes of the machines may be changed in line 14 and 16. Assume that the statement holds\nfor some n then after the execution of Tn the symbols under the heads of the machines will be the same.\nCorollary 1 (One tape is enough). It is important both theoretical but also from implementation aspects that computer simulation of orchestrated machines can be based on using only one common tape.\nCorollary 2 (F would be computed locally). In line 16, if G contains the state that is appeared on the right side of the rule F → Tn then F (computed in line 14) would be equal to exec(G,Tn).\nThere are special cases in which the behavior of Alg. 1 is equivalent with a non-deterministic Turing machine (NDTM). It is shown in the next theorem.\nTheorem 2 (Relation to the NDTMs). Let H ⊆ M , Fi = {F |F → T ∈ fGi}, Gi ∈ H, i = 1, . . . , k. If Fi = Fj, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k then there is an equivalent NDTM to the orchestrated machine OrchMach1(H).\nProof. There are two possible way to run the machine OrchMach1(H) 1. there is N ∈ N that for all n < N , Mn = Mn−1, Mn = ∅ 2. for all n ∈ N holds that Mn = Mn−1. We can construct an equivalent NDTM as follows: fNDTM = ∪Fi = Fj , j ∈ {1, . . . , k}.\nCorollary 3 (Deterministic decomposition of NDTMs). For every NDTM there exists an equivalent OM1.\nProof. The proof is constructive. Let (a, x) be the left side of a non-deterministic rule of a NDTM with right sides (a, x) = {(b1, y1, d1), . . . , (bn, yn, dn)} and let T be a NDTM. Perform the algorithm shown in Alg. 2. After this, the breed H satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.\nAlgorithm 2 The algorithm of the proof of Corollary 3\n1: H = {T} 2: if there exist a non-deterministic rule (a, x)→ in machines in H then 3: A ruleset (a, x)→ is selected and let H ′ = ∅. 4: for G ∈ H do .

The set H ⊆ M is referred to as a Turing machine breed (or simply a breed) if OrchMach1(H) halts, that is if there exist a finite sequence on(H). A breed H is called non-trivial if on(H) ≥ 2, where the overline denotes the mean value.\nDefinition 2 (Convergence and divergence of machine breeds). A machine breed H is divergent if for all K ∈ N there exist Ok(H) such that OrchMach1(H) ≥ K. A machine breed is convergent if it is not divergent.\nExample 1 (A divergent breed). Let A = ({0}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 0) → (0, 1,→ )}) and and B = ({0}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 0) → (0, 0,←)}) be two Turing machines then it is easy to see that the breed {A,B} is divergent. For example, let k = K and the following transition rules have been chosen: O2 = (A, (0, 0) → (0, 1,→ )), . . . , Ok−1 = (A, (0, 0)→ (0, 1,→)), Ok = (B, (0, 0)→ (0, 0,←)).\nExample 2 (A convergent breed). Let C = ({0, 1, 2}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 0)→ (1, 0,→ ), (1, 0) → (2, 0,→)}) and D = ({0, 1, 2}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 0) → (1, 1,→), (1, 0) → (2, 1,→)}) be two Turing machines shown in Fig. 2. It may be shown easily that the breed {C,D} is convergent because it may be corresponded to the non-deterministic Turing machine shown in Fig. 2 that always halts.\nExample 3 (An infinite breed from finite machines). The Turing machines E = ({0}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 0) → (0, 1, ↑)}) and J = ({0}, 0, {0, 1}, {(0, 1) → (0, 0, ↑ )}) shown in Fig. 3 are not infinite loops but the breed {E, J} is divergent.\nTheorem 3. Let H ⊆ M is a breed. If H contains an infinite loop then it is divergent.\nProof. The proof is trivial, simply select the transition rule of the infinite loop machine in every step.\nTheorem 4 (Halting of orchestrated machines). The language of convergent breeds is algorithmically undecidable.\nProof. It is trivial because the sublanguage of trivial convergent breeds gives a well-known variant of the halting problem. (A breed H is called trivial if card(H) = 1.)\nDefinition 3 (Purebred breeds). A convergent machine breed H is purebred if there is no real subset M1 ⊂ H such that {OrchMach1(M1, ′T ′)} = {OrchMach1(H, ′T ′)} where ′T ′ denotes a possible result of the computation OrchMach1 for precise details see from line 23 to line 31 in Alg. 3.\nAlgorithm 3 Orchestrated machines (return values)\nInput: M0 ⊆M , m ∈ {′N ′, ′T ′, ′O′, ′o′} . indicates what return value will be returned . . .\n1: procedure OrchMach1(M0, m) . . .\n23: if m = ′N ′ then 24: return N 25: else if m = ′O′ then 26: return O2 = (G2, T2), . . . , ON−1 = (GN−1, TN−1) 27: else if m = ′o′ then 28: return o2 = card(M2), . . . , oN−1 = card(MN−1) 29: else if m = ′T ′ then 30: return the concatenation of tape symbols from the leftmost 1 to the right-\nmost 1 (or ∞ if N is equal to ∞) 31: end if 32: end procedure\nExample 4 (A purebred breed and a not purebred one). In Example 2 the breed {C,D} is purebred but if the machine G = ({0, 3}, 0, {0, 1}, {(3, 0)→ (3, 1,→)}) is added to the breed {C,D} then the result {C,D,G} breed will be not purebred.\nIn the following, let B(M) denote the set of all purebred Turing machine breeds.\nDefinition 4 (iq, eq). Let H ∈ B(M) be a purebred breed, the quantity iq(H) = max{OrchMach1(H)}, iq : B(M) → N is called the intelligence quotient and similarly the quantity eq(H) = max{ ⌊ on(H) ⌋ }, eq : B(M) → N is called the\nemotional quotient of the breed H.\nDefinition 5 (Intelligence functions). Let N,Z ∈ N be natural numbers. The functions\neq : N→ N, eq(N) = max H∈B(M)\n{ ⌊ on(H) ⌋ | OrchMach1(H) = N}\niq : N→ N, iq(Z) = max H∈B(M)\n{OrchMach1(H) | ⌊ on(H) ⌋ = Z}\nare called intelligence functions of breeds, where bc denotes the floor function, but a more precise definition can be given that uses Def. 4 as follows\nEQ : N→ N, EQ(N) = max H∈B(M)\n{ ⌊ on(H) ⌋ | iq(H) = N}\nIQ : N→ N, IQ(Z) = max H∈B(M) {OrchMach1(H) | eq(H) = Z}\nIn intuitive sense, the function EQ(N) gives the maximum number of machines that can do N steps together in a purebred breed, and inversely, IQ(Z) gives the maximum number of steps that can be done by Z machines together as members of a purebred breed. It is to be noted that functions EQ and IQ are well defined total functions due to M is a finite set.\nTheorem 5. Let x, y ∈ N be natural numbers, EQ(x) ≥ y ⇔ IQ(y) ≥ x.\nProof. It simply follows from the structure of the definitions of EQ and IQ.\nIt is an open question whether or not there is an interesting relation between the functions IQ and EQ. At this point, we have just started to collect experiences with orchestrated machines. We have developed a computer program to help automatically investigate Turing machine breeds. The program can be found in the git repository at https://github.com/nbatfai/orchmach. It allows to gather experience with orchestrated machines. The results of some first experiments are presented in Table 1, where the first column shows the cardinality of the examined breed. The second column is the maximum number of ones of a given breed’s individual Turing machines. For example, the breed labelled by “5a” contains the Marxen and Buntrock’s champion machine so its first “1s” column is 4097. (We have used several well-known Busy Beaver TMs like Marxen and Buntrock’s champion machines, Uhing’s machines or Schult’s machines [10]. The exact lists of TMs of examined breeds and full running logs are available at http://www.inf.unideb.hu/~nbatfai/orchmach or in the sources at https://github.com/nbatfai/orchmach.) The third column is the usual time complexity of the most powerful individual Turing machine contained in the previous column. The other columns show running results that are organized in triplet groups of three, the first column of triplets is maximized for\no2, the second one is maximized for OrchMach1(H, ′N ′) and the last one is maximized for the number of ones. For example, it is very interesting that with the exception of the first 21 time steps of the computation of the 75001 ones was done by Uhing’s machine in 3.272948454 ∗ 109 time steps. (For further details, see related running log at the author’s homepage http://www.inf.unideb.hu/~nbatfai/orchmach/ data/breed_3a_sel.txt.)\nIt is likely a significant observation that there are breeds that are more powerful if their o2 are greater than 1, for example, see the triplet (6, 831, 59) in the row “21” of Table 1. This situation is well presented by the plot labelled exp. 7/breed 10 (“21”) in Fig. 4.\nFinally, it should be noted that the program suggests that it is possible that the listed breeds may be convergent.\nFig. 5 shows further computational results of some probably convergent breeds. It is clear that IQ(1) ≥ 70740809 because this estimation is based on the machine ( 9, 0, 11, 1, 15, 2, 17, 3, 1, 4, 23, 5, 24, 6, 3, 7, 21, 9, 0 ) as a trivial breed. (In practice, this machine is a variant of the Marxen and Buntrock’s champion machine, see also [1]). But our experiments have already found a probably convergent “quasi-trivial” breed, shown in Table 1, that can produce 75001 ones so it follows from this that IQ(1) ≥ 3.272948454 ∗ 109. (A computation of a non-trivial breed is called quasi-trivial if its o2 value is equal to 1.)\nDefinition 6 (Intelligence quotients of Turing machines). Let V ∈ M be a Turing machine, the quantity iq(V ) = maxH∈B(M){OrchMach1(H) | V ∈ H} is called the intelligence quotient and similarly eq(V ) = maxH∈B(M){on(H) | V ∈\nH} is called the emotional intelligence quotient of the Turing machine V ."

      "text" : "We have introduced a new special type of universal Turing machine called orchestrated machine that allows to begin the investigation of an a’priori ability of certain Turing machines to work with each other. Among purebred machine breeds we have defined two non-computable total functions EQ and IQ to catalyze the search for more interesting machine breeds.\nIn this paper, the time complexity classes of orchestrated machines were not being investigated but it is clear that the NP ⊆ OM1P, where OM1P denotes the class of decision problems solvable by an orchestrated machine (with algorithm\nOrchMach1) in polynomial time. This inclusion follows from the Theorem 3. We have many other exciting and unanswered questions for future research. For example, in this paper, the orchestrated machines have been built from Turing machines. Is it possible for an orchestrated machine to be constructed from orchestrated machines?\nWe believe machine breeds would become a good model for processes that can be well distinguished from each other. As an intuitive example, in a living cell, several well-known processes (such as reverse transcription or citric acid cycle) are taking place in the same time, these processes together can be seen as a “breed”. To illustrate our intuition, we can provide a further subjective example of a“breed”. When the author listens to Ferenc Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody, for piano No. 15 (Rákóczi marsch) then the author’s “sensor program” (that listens to the music) and Liszt’s “generator program” (that wrote the music) may form a “breed”. As a first step towards in this direction, it has already been an interesting and unanswered question whether the orchestrated architecture introduced in this paper can be developed for higher-level programming models.\nThe main question is that how can we develop computing architectures that will be able to replace sequential nature of the Neumann architecture in some a’priori AI application domain, for example, in reproducing the human thinking. We have given a new model for Turing machines. But it is also true that at this point we can imagine only evolutionary programming methods for general programming of orchestrated machines."
