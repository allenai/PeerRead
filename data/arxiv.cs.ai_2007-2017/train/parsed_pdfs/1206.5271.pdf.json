However, these heuristics also restrict the types of relationships that can be learned exclusively from data. They are unable to learn relationships that exhibit “correlation-immunity”, such as parity. To learn Bayesian networks in the presence of correlation-immune relationships, we extend the Sparse Candidate algorithm with a technique called “skewing”. This technique uses the observation that relationships that are correlation-immune under a speci ̄c input distribution may not be correlation-immune under another, su±ciently di®erent distribution. We show that by extending Sparse Candidate with this technique we are able to discover relationships between random variables that are approximately correlation-immune, with a signi ̄cantly lower computational cost than the alternative of considering multiple parents of a node at a time.",
