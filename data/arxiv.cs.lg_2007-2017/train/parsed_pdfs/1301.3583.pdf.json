      "text" : "Deep learning and neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results on vision 1, language 2 , and audio-processing tasks 3. All these cases involved fairly large datasets, but in all these cases, even larger ones could be used. One of the major challenges remains to extend neural networks on a much larger scale, and with this objective in mind, this paper asks a simple question: is there an optimization issue that prevents efficiently training larger networks?\nPrior evidence of the failure of big networks in the litterature can be found for example in Coates et al. (2011), which shows that increasing the capacity of certain neural net methods quickly reaches a point of diminishing returns on the test error. These results have since been extended to other types of auto-encoders and RBMs (Rifai et al., 2011; Courville et al., 2011). Furthermore, Coates et al. (2011) shows that while neural net methods fail to leverage added capacity K-Means can. This has allowed K-Means to reach state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 for methods that do not use artificial transformations. This is an unexpected result because K-Means is a much dumber unsupervised learning algorithm when compared with RBMs and regularized auto-encoders. Coates et al. (2011) argues that this is mainly due to K-Means making better use of added capacity, but it does not explain why the neural net methods failed to do this."

      "text" : "We will perform experiments with the well known ImageNet LSVRC-2010 object detection dataset4. The subset used in the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2010 contains 1000 object categories and 1.2 million training images.\n1Krizhevsky et al. (2012) reduced by almost one half the error rate on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition benchmark\n2Mikolov et al. (2011) reduced perplexity on WSJ by 40% and speech recognition absolute word error rate by > 1%.\n3For speech recognition, Seide et al. (2011) report relative word error rates decreasing by about 30% on datasets of 309 hours\n4http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/\nar X\niv :1\n30 1.\n35 83\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 6\nJa n\n20 13\nThis dataset has many attractive features:\n1. The task is difficult enough for current algorithms that there is still room for much improvement. For instance, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) was able to reduce the error by half recently. What’s more the state-of-the-art is at 15.3% error. Assuming minimal error in the human labelling of the dataset, it should be possible to reach errors close to 0%.\n2. Improvements on ImageNet are thought to be a good proxy for progress in object recognition (Deng et al., 2009).\n3. It has a large number of examples. This is the setting that is commonly found in industry where datasets reach billions of examples. Interestingly, as you increase the amount of data, the training error converges to the generalization error. In other words, reducing training error is well correlated with reducing generalization error, when large datasets are available. Therefore, it stands to reason that resolving underfitting problems may yield significant improvements.\nWe use the features provided by the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 20105. The images are convolved with SIFT features, then K-Means is used to form a visual vocabulary of 1000 visual words. Following the litterature, we report the Top-5 error rate only.\nThe experiments focus on the behavior of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) as capacity is increased. This is done by increasing the number of hidden units in the network. The final classification layer of the network is a softmax over possible classes (softmax(x) = e−x/ ∑ i e\n−xi ). The hidden layers use the logistic sigmoid activation function (σ(x) = 1/(1+e−x)). We initialize the weights of the hidden layer according to the formula proposed by Glorot and Bengio (2010). The parameters of the classification layer are initialized to 0, along with all the bias (offset) parameters of the MLP.\nThe hyper-parameters to tune are the learning rate and the number of hidden units. We are interested in optimization performance so we cross-validate them based on the training error. We use a grid search with the learning rates taken from {0.1, 0.01} and the number of hiddens from {1000, 2000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 15000}. When we report the performance of a network with a given number of units we choose the best learning rate. We do not use any regularization because it would typically not help to decrease the training set error. The number of epochs is set to 300 so that it is large enough for the networks to converge.\nThe experiments are run on a cluster of Nvidia Geforce GTX 580 GPUs with the help of the Theano library (Bergstra et al., 2010). We make use of HDF5 (Folk et al., 2011) to load the dataset in a lazy fashion because of its large size. The shortest training experiment took 10 hours to run and the longest took 28 hours."

      "text" : "Figure 1 shows the evolution of the training error as the capacity is increased. The common intuition is that this increased capacity will help fit the training set - possibly to the detriment of generalization error. For this reason practitioners have focused mainly on the problem of overfitting the dataset when dealing with large networks - not underfitting. In fact, much research is concerned with proper regularization of such large networks (Hinton et al., 2012, 2006).\nHowever, our results show that adding capacity quickly fails to reduce underfitting. It becomes increasingly difficult for the networks to use additional units to fit the training set. As shown in Figure 2, the return on investment for additional units fades to nil without reaching 0 errors on the training set. This means there is an optimization problem that prevents us from effectively training big networks.\nFor reference, we also include the learning curves of the networks used for Figure 1 and 2 in Figure 3. We see that the curves for capacities above 5000 all converge towards the same point.\n5http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/download-public"

      "text" : "The stagnant underfitting observed in larger networks seems to be a failure of first order gradient descent.\nIn fact, we know that the first order approximation fails when there are a lot of interactions between hidden units. It may be that adding units increases the interactions between units and causes the Hessian to be ill-conditioned. This reasoning suggests two research directions:\n• methods that break interactions between large numbers of units. This helps the Hessian to be better conditioned and will lead to better effectiveness for first-order descent. This type of method can be implemented efficiently. Examples of this approach are sparsity and orthognality penalties.\n• methods that model interactions between hidden units. For example, second order methods (Martens, 2010) and natural gradient methods (Le Roux et al., 2008). Typically, these are expensive approaches and the challenge is in scaling them to large datasets, where stochas-\ntic gradient approaches may dominate. The ideal target is a stochastic natural gradient or stochastic second-order method.\nThe optimization failure may also be due to other reasons. For example, networks with more capacity have more local minima. Future work should investigate tests that help discriminate between ill-conditioning issues and local minima issues.\nFixing this optimization problem may be the key to unlocking better performance of deep networks. Based on past observations (Bengio, 2009; Erhan et al., 2010), we expect this optimization problem to worsen for deeper networks, and our experimental setup should be extended to measure the effect of depth. As we have noted earlier, improvements on the training set error should be well correlated with generalization for large datasets."
