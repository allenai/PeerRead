Recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse learning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator problem, which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm, we use a line search initialized by the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule that allows finding an appropriate step size quickly. The paper also presents a detailed convergence analysis of the GIST algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive experiments on large-scale data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 21:41:53 GMT  (98kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4434v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA stat.CO stat.ML", "authors": ["pinghua gong", "changshui zhang", "zhaosong lu", "jianhua huang", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1303.4434"}
