Most existing rumor detection models employ learning algorithms that incorporate a wide variety of features and formulate rumor detection into a binary classi cation task. ey commonly cra features manually from the content, sentiment [51], user pro les [30, 31, 47], and di usion pa erns of the posts [12, 16, 18, 34, 36, 37]. Embedding social graphs into a classi cation model also helps distinguish malicious user comments from normal ones [20, 21]. ese approaches aim at extracting distinctive features to describe rumors faithfully.\n1h p://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2313652/AP-Twi er-hackers-break-newsWhite-House-explosions-injured-Obama.html\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n05 97\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 A\npr 2\nHowever, feature engineering is extremely time-consuming, biased, and labor-intensive. Moreover, hand-cra ed features are data-dependent, making them incapable of capturing contextual variations in di erent posts.\nMore close examinations on rumors reveal that social posts related to an event under discussion are coming in the form of time series wherein users forward or comment on it continuously over time. As shown in Fig.1 (a), posts in regards to an event of US presidency are coming continuously along the event’s timelines. us, to tackle with time series of posts, descriptive features should be extracted from contexts. However, as shown in Fig.1 (b), users’ posts exhibit high duplication in their textual phrases due to the repeated forwarding, reviews, and/or inquiry behavior [49]. is poses a challenge on e ciently distilling distinct information from duplication, and exible to capture their contextual variations as the rumor di uses over time.\ne propagation of information on social media has temporal characteristics, whilst most existing rumor detection methodologies ignore such a crucial property or are not able to capture the temporal dimension of data. One exception is [17] where Ma et al. uses an RNN to capture the dynamic temporal signals of rumor di usion and learn textual representations under supervision. However, as the rumor di usion evolves over time, users tend to comment di erently in various stages, such as from expressing surprise to questioning, or from believing to debunking. As a consequence, textual features may change their importance with time and we need to determine which of them are more important to the detection task. On the other hand, the existence of duplication in textual phrases impedes the e ciency of training a deep network. Although some studies on duplication detection are available and e ective in di erent tasks [15, 26, 50], these approaches are not applicable in our case where the duplication cannot be determined beforehand but is rather varied across post series over time. In this sense, two aspects of temporal long-term characteristic and dynamic duplication should be addressed simultaneously in an early rumor detection model."

      "text" : "In summary, there are three challenges in early rumor detection to be addressed: (1) automatically learning representations for rumors instead of using labor-intensive hand-cra ed features; (2) the di culty of maintaining the long-range dependency among variable-length post series to build their internal representations; (3) the issue of high duplication compounded with varied contextual focus. To combat these challenges, we propose a novel deep a ention based recurrent neural network (RNN) for early detection on rumors, namely CallAtRumors (Call Attention to Rumors). e overview of our framework is illustrated in Fig 2. Our model processes streaming textual sequences constructed by encoding contextual information from posts related to one event into a series of feature matrices. en, the RNN with a ention mechanism automatically learns latent representations by feed-forwarding each input weighted by a ention probability distribution while adaptive to contextual variations. Moreover, an additional hidden layer with siдmoid activation function using the learned latent representations predicts the event to be rumors or not.\nOur framework is premised on the RNNs which are proved to be e ective in recent machine learning tasks [1, 7] in handling sequential data. is o ers us the opportunity to automatically explore deep feature representations from original inputs for efcient rumor detection, thus avoiding the complexity of feature engineering. With a ention mechanism, the proposed approach is able to selectively associate more importance with relevant features. Hence, we are able to tackle the problem in the context of high textual duplication and the e ciency of feature learning in early detection is ensured."

Also the propagation pa erns of rumors were developed by Wu et al. through utilizing a message propagation tree where each node represents a text message to classify whether the root of the tree is a rumor or not [37]. In [18], a dynamic time series structure was proposed to capture the temporal features based on the time series context information generated in every rumor’s life-cycle.

As those methods neglect the temporal trait of social media data, a time-series based feature structure[18] is introduced to seize context variation over time. Recently, recurrent neural network was rst introduced to rumor detection by Ma et al. [17], utilizing sequential data to spontaneously capture temporal textual characteristics of rumor di usion which helps detecting rumor earlier with accuracy. However, without abundant data with di erentiable contents in the early stage of a rumor, the performance of these methods drops signi cantly because they fail to distinguish important pa erns."

      "text" : "As a rising technique in NLP (natural language processing) problems [22, 28, 46], Bahdanau et al. extended the basic encoderdecoder architecture of neural machine translation with a ention mechanism to allow the model to automatically search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word [2], achieving a comparable performance in the English-to-French translation task. Vinyals et al. improved the a ention model in [2], so their model computed an a ention vector re ecting how much a ention should be put over the input words and boosted the performance on large scale translation [29]. In addition, Sharma et al. applied a location so max function [25] to the hidden states of the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) layer, thus recognizing more valuable elements in sequential inputs for action recognition. In conclusion, motivated by the successful applications of a ention mechanism, we nd that a ention-based techniques can help better detect rumors with regards to both e ectiveness and earliness because they are sensitive to distinctive textual features."

      "text" : "Recurrent neural networks, or RNNs [23], are a family of feedforward neural networks for processing sequential data, such as a sequence of values x1, ...,xτ . RNNs process an input sequence one element xt at a time, updates the hidden units ht , a “state vector” that implicitly contains information about the history of all the past elements of the sequence (x<t ), and generates output vector ot [13]. e forward propagation begins with a speci cation of the initial state h0, then, for each time step t from t = 1 to t = τ , the following update equations are applied [6]:\nht = tanh(Uxt +Wht−1 + b), ot = Vht + c,\n(1)\nwhere parameters U , V and W are weight matrices for input-tohidden, hidden-to-output and hidden-to-hidden connections, respectively. b and c are the bias vectors. tanh(·) is a hyperbolic tangent non-linear function.\ne gradient computation of RNNs involves performing backpropagation through time (BPTT) [23]. In practice, a standard RNN is di cult to be trained due to the well-known vanishing or exploding gradients caused by the incapability of RNN in capturing the long-distance temporal dependencies for the gradient based optimization [3, 40]. To tackle this training di culty, an e ective solution is to includes “memory” cells to store information over time, which are known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [7, 9]. In this work, we employ LSTM as basic unit to capture long term temporal dependency among streaming variable-length post series."

On the other hand, a claim is generally associated with a number of posts that are relevant to the claim. ese relevant posts regarding a claim can be easily collected to describe the central content more faithfully. Hence, we are interested in detecting rumor on an aggregate level instead of identifying each single posts [17]. In other words, we focus on detecting rumors on event-level wherein sequential posts related to the same topics are batched together to constitute an event, and our model determines whether the event is a rumor or not.\nLet E = {Ei } denote a set of given events, where each event Ei = {(pi, j , ti, j )}nij=1 consists of all relevant posts pi, j at time stamp ti, j , and the task is to classify each event as a rumor or not."

      "heading" : "4.2 Constructing Variable-Length Post Series",
      "text" : "For each event Ei , we collect a set of relevant post series to be the input of our model to learn latent representations. Within every event, posts are divided into time intervals, each of which is regarded as a batch. is is because it is not practical to deal with each post individually in the large number scale. To ensure a similar word density for each time step within one event, we group posts into batches according to a xed post amount N rather than slice the event time span evenly.\nAlgorithm 1 describes the construction of variable-length post series. Speci cally, for every event Ei = {(pi, j , ti, j )}nij=1, post series are constructed with variable lengths due to di erent amount of posts relevant to di erent events. We set a minimum series length Min to maintain the sequential property for all events. For events containing no less than N×Min posts, we iteratively take the rst N posts out of Ei and feed them into a time interval T . e last ni − N b niN c posts are treated as the last time interval. For events containing less than N×Min posts, we put b niMin c posts to the rst Min − 1 intervals and assign the rest into the last interval TMin .\nTo model di erent words, we calculate the tf-idf (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) for the most frequent K vocabularies within all posts. Proved to be an e ective and lightweight textual feature, tf-idf is a numerical statistic that is intended to re ect how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus [14]. In this case, for each post we have a K-word dictionary re ecting the importance of every word in a post, and the value is 0 if the word never appears in this post. Finally, every post is encoded by the corresponding K-word tf-idf dictionary, and within a speci c internal a matrix of K×N can be constructed as the input of our model. If there are less than N posts within an interval, we will expand it to the same scale by padding with 0s. Hence, each set of post series consists of at least Min feature matrices with a same size of K (number of vocabularies) × N (vocabulary feature dimension)."

To calculate xt , we introduce an a ention weight at [i], i = 1, . . . ,K , corresponding to the feature extracted at di erent element positions in a tf-idf matrix dt . Speci cally, at each time stamp t , our model predicts at+1, a so max over K positions, and yt , a so max over the binary class of rumors and non-rumors with an additional hidden layer with siдmoid(·) activations (see Fig.3 (c)). e location so max [25] is thus, applied over the hidden states of the last LSTM layer to calculate at+1, the a ention weight for the next input matrix dt+1:\nat+1[i] = P(Lt+1 = i |ht ) = eWi >ht∑K j=1 e W >j ht i ∈ 1, ...,K , (3)\nwhere at+1[i] is the a ention probability for the i-th element (word index) at time step t + 1,Wi is the weight matrix allocated to the i-th element, and Lt+1 is a random variable which represents the word index and takes 1-of-K values. e a ention vector at+1 is a probability distribution, representing the importance a ached to each word in the input matrix dt+1. Our model is optimized to assign higher focus to words that are believed to be distinct in learning rumor/non-rumor representations. A er calculating these probabilities, the so deterministic attention mechanism [2] computes the expected value of the input at the next time step xt+1 by taking expectation over the word matrix at di erent positions:\nxt+1 = EP (Lt+1 |ht )[dt+1] = K∑ i=1 at+1[i]dt+1[i], (4)\nwhere dt+1 is the input matrix at time step t + 1 and dt+1[i] is the feature vector of the i-th position in the matrix dt+1. us, Eq.(4) formulates a deterministic a ention model by computing a so a ention weighted word vector ∑ i at+1[i]dt+1[i]. is corresponds to feeding a so -a-weighted context into the system, whilst the whole model is smooth and di erential under the deterministic a ention, and thus learning end-to-end is trivial by using standard back-propagation.\nWe remark that a ention models can be classi ed into so a ention and hard a ention models. So a ention models are shown to be deterministic and can be trained by using back-propagation whereas hard a ention models are stochastic and the training requires the REINFORCE algorithm [19] or by maximizing a variational lower bound or using importance sampling [1, 45]. If we use hard a ention models, we should sample Lt from a so max distribution of Eq.(3). e input xt+1 would then be the feature at the sampled location instead of taking expectation over all the elements in dt+1. Apparently, hard a ention solutions are not differentiable and have to resort to some sampling, and thus we deploy so a ention in our model."

It also contains 494 normal events from Snopes and two public datasets [4, 12]. For each event, the keywords are extracted and manually re ned until the composed queries can have precise Twi er search results [17]. All labelled events and related Tweet IDs are published by the authors, however some Tweets are no longer available when we crawled those Tweets, causing a 10% shrink on the scale of data compared with the original Twi er dataset. • e Weibo dataset contains 2,313 rumors and 2,351 nonrumors. e polarity of all events are veri ed on Sina Community Management Center5. en the keywords are manually summarized and modi ed for comprehensive post search for data collection using Weibo API.\nIn addition, to balance the ration of rumors and non-romors, we follow the criteria from [17] to manually gather 4 non-rumors from Twi er and 38 rumors from Weibo to achieve a 1:1 ratio of rumors to non-rumors. e data collection procedure and our dataset structure are shown in Figure 46.\nTable 1 gives statistical details of the two datasets. We observe that more than 80% of the users tend to repost the original news with very short comments to re ect their a itudes towards those news. As a consequence, the contents of the posts related to one event are mostly duplicate, triggering scarcity when extracting distinctive textual pa erns within overlapping context.

Figure 6 illustrates the intermediate a ention results on di erent words within a detected rumor event. e e ectiveness validation proves the a ect of a ention mechanism in making LSTM units sensitive to distinctive words and tokens by associating more importance to certain locations in every feature matrix against other ones."

      "text" : "CERT [39]\nTo demonstrate how the conditions of datasets a ect the performance of rumor detection, we compare the performance of CallAtRumors with CERT using di erent datasets. To reproduce the same experimental conditions as [39], we have also organized a sample dataset using the criteria described in the work. We use queries generated from 220 reported rumors on Snopes and regular expressions belonging to the same topics to crawl 7,580 Tweets and manually labeled each Tweet by reading the content and referring\nto the Snopes article. At last we result in a sample dataset contain-\ning 1,193 rumor Tweets and 6,387 non-rumor Tweets, which also\nhas a similar ratio of rumors to non-rumors as the dataset in [39]. Table 4 shows the di erent results when CallAtRumors and CERT are applied to this sample dataset and our Twi er dataset. e results further explains our model’s capability of capturing valuable pa erns within our large-scale duplicated datasets by applying a ention to more representative words."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we study the property of our approach in its earliness. To have fair comparison, we allow exiting rumor detection methods to be trained on rumors that are for evaluation. rough incrementally adding training data in the chronological order, we are able to estimate the time that our method can detect emerging rumors. e results on earliness are shown in Fig 7. At the early stage with 10% to 60% training data, CallAtRomors outperforms four comparative methods by a noticeable margin. In particular, compared with the most relevant method of ML-GRU, as the data proportion ranging from 10% to 20%, CallAtRumors outperforms ML-GRU by 5% on precision and 4% on recall on both Twi er and Weibo datasets. e result shows that a ention mechanism is more\ne ective in early stage detection by focusing on the most distinct features in advance. With more data applied into test, all methods are approaching their best performance. For Twi er dataset and Weibo Dataset with averagely 80% duplicate contents in each event, our method starts with 74.02% and 71.73% in precision while 68.75% and 70.34% in recall, which means an average time lag of 20.47 hours a er the emerge of one event. is result is promising because the average report time over the rumors given by Snopes and Sina Community Management Center is 54 hours and 72 hours respectively [17], and we can save much manual e ort with the help of our deep a ention based early rumor detection technique."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "Rumor detection on social media is time-sensitive because it is hard to eliminate the vicious impact in its late period of di usion as rumors can spread quickly and broadly. In this paper, we introduce CallAtRumors, a novel recurrent neural network model based on so a ention mechanism to automatically carry out early rumor detection by learning latent representations from the sequential social posts. We conducted experiments with ve state-of-the-art rumor detection methods to illustrate that CallAtRumors is sensitive to distinguishable words, thus outperforming the competitors even when textual feature is sparse at the beginning stage of a rumor. In addition, we demonstrate the capability of our model to handle duplicate data with a further comparison. In our future work, it would be appealing to investigate the possibility to combine more complexed feature with our deep a ention model. For example, we\ncan model the propagation pa ern of rumors as sequential inputs for RNNs to improve the detection accuracy. e future work may investigate the e ciency issue using hashing techniques [32, 41] over multi-level feature spaces [33, 35, 38, 42, 43]."

Automatically debunking rumors at their stage of diusion is known as early rumor detection, which refers to dealing with sequential posts regarding disputed factual claims with certain variations and highly textual duplication over time. us, identifying trending rumors demands an ecient yet exible model that is able to capture long-range dependencies among postings and produce distinct representations for the accurate early detection. However, it is a challenging task to apply conventional classication algorithms to rumor detection in earliness since they rely on hand-craed features which require intensive manual eorts in the case of large amount of posts. is paper presents a deep aention model on the basis of recurrent neural networks (RNN) to learn selectively temporal hidden representations of sequential posts for identifying rumors. e proposed model delves so-aention into the recurrence to simultaneously pool out distinct features with particular focus and produce hidden representations that capture contextual variations of relevant posts over time. Extensive experiments on real datasets collected from social media websites demonstrate that (1) the deep aention based RNN model outperforms state-of-thearts that rely on hand-craed features; (2) the introduction of so aention mechanism can eectively distill relevant parts to rumors from original posts in advance; (3) the proposed method detects rumors more quickly and accurately than competitors.",
