      "text" : "ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expertcreated resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use.\nWhen ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies."

      "text" : "ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language (terms) with labeled, weighted edges (assertions). The original release of ConceptNet (Liu and Singh 2004) was intended as a parsed representation of Open Mind Common Sense (Singh 2002), a crowd-sourced knowledge project. This paper describes the release of ConceptNet 5.5, which has expanded to include lexical and world knowledge from many different sources in many languages.\nConceptNet represents relations between words such as:\n• A net is used for catching fish. • “Leaves” is a form of the word “leaf ”. • The word cold in English is studený in Czech. • O alimento é usado para comer [Food is used for eating]. Copyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nIn this paper, we will concisely represent assertions such as the above as triples of their start node, relation label, and end node: the assertion that “a dog has a tail” can be represented as (dog, HasA, tail).\nConceptNet also represents links between knowledge resources. In addition to its own knowledge about the English term astronomy, for example, ConceptNet contains links to URLs that define astronomy in WordNet, Wiktionary, OpenCyc, and DBPedia.\nThe graph-structured knowledge in ConceptNet can be particularly useful to NLP learning algorithms, particularly those based on word embeddings, such as (Mikolov et al. 2013). We can use ConceptNet to build semantic spaces that are more effective than distributional semantics alone.\nThe most effective semantic space is one that learns from both distributional semantics and ConceptNet, using a generalization of the “retrofitting” method (Faruqui et al. 2015). We call this hybrid semantic space “ConceptNet Numberbatch”, to clarify that it is a separate artifact from ConceptNet itself.\nConceptNet Numberbatch performs significantly better than other systems across many evaluations of word relatedness, and this increase in performance translates to improvements on downstream tasks such as analogies. On a corpus of SAT-style analogy questions (Turney 2006), its accuracy of 56.1% outperforms other systems based on word embeddings and ties the previous best overall system, Turney’s LRA. This level of accuracy is only slightly lower than the performance of the average human test-taker.\nBuilding word embeddings is not the only application of ConceptNet, but it is a way to apply ConceptNet that achieves clear benefits and is compatible with ongoing research in distributional semantics.\nAfter introducing related work, we will begin by describing ConceptNet 5.5 and its features, show how to use ConceptNet alone as a semantic space and a measure of word relatedness, and then proceed to describe and evaluate the hybrid system ConceptNet Numberbatch on these various semantic tasks."

It was last published as version 5.2 (Speer and Havasi 2013).\nMany projects strive to create lexical resources of general knowledge. Cyc (Lenat and Guha 1989) has built an ontology of common-sense knowledge in predicate logic form over the decades. DBPedia (Auer et al. 2007) extracts knowledge from Wikipedia infoboxes, providing a large number of facts, largely focused on named entities that have Wikipedia articles. The Google Knowledge Graph (Singhal 2012) is perhaps the largest and most general knowledge graph, though its content is not freely available. It focuses largely on named entities that can be disambiguated, with a motto of “things, not strings”.\nConceptNet’s role compared to these other resources is to provide a sufficiently large, free knowledge graph that focuses on the common-sense meanings of words (not named entities) as they are used in natural language. This focus on words makes it particularly compatible with the idea of representing word meanings as vectors.\nWord embeddings represent words as dense unit vectors of real numbers, where vectors that are close together are semantically related. This representation is appealing because it represents meaning as a continuous space, where similarity and relatedness can be treated as a metric. Word embeddings are often produced as a side-effect of a machine learning task, such as predicting a word in a sentence from its neighbors. This approach to machine learning about semantics is sometimes referred to as distributional semantics or distributed word representations, and it contrasts with the knowledge-driven approach of semantic networks or knowledge graphs.\nTwo prominent matrices of embeddings are the word2vec embeddings trained on 100 billion words of Google News using skip-grams with negative sampling (Mikolov et al. 2013), and the GloVe 1.2 embeddings trained on 840 billion words of the Common Crawl (Pennington, Socher, and Manning 2014). These matrices are downloadable, and we will be using them both as a point of comparison and as inputs to an ensemble. Levy, Goldberg, and Dagan (2015) evaluated multiple embedding techniques and the effects of various explicit and implicit hyperparameters, produced their own performant word embeddings using a truncated SVD of words and their contexts, and provided recommendations for the engineering of word embeddings.\nHolographic embeddings (Nickel, Rosasco, and Poggio 2016) are embeddings learned from a labeled knowledge graph, under the constraint that a circular correlation of these embeddings gives a vector representing a relation. This representation seems extremely relevant to ConceptNet. In our attempt to implement it on ConceptNet so far, it has converged too slowly to experiment with, but this could be overcome eventually with some optimization and additional computing power."

      "text" : "ConceptNet 5.5 is built from the following sources:\n• Facts acquired from Open Mind Common Sense (OMCS) (Singh 2002) and sister projects in other languages (Anacleto et al. 2006)\n• Information extracted from parsing Wiktionary, in multiple languages, with a custom parser (“Wikiparsec”)\n• “Games with a purpose” designed to collect common knowledge (von Ahn, Kedia, and Blum 2006) (Nakahara and Yamada 2011) (Kuo et al. 2009)\n• Open Multilingual WordNet (Bond and Foster 2013), a linked-data representation of WordNet (Miller et al. 1998) and its parallel projects in multiple languages\n• JMDict (Breen 2004), a Japanese-multilingual dictionary • OpenCyc, a hierarchy of hypernyms provided by Cyc\n(Lenat and Guha 1989), a system that represents common sense knowledge in predicate logic\n• A subset of DBPedia (Auer et al. 2007), a network of facts extracted from Wikipedia infoboxes\nWith the combination of these sources, ConceptNet contains over 21 million edges and over 8 million nodes. Its English vocabulary contains approximately 1,500,000 nodes, and there are 83 languages in which it contains at least 10,000 nodes.\nThe largest source of input for ConceptNet is Wiktionary, which provides 18.1 million edges and is mostly responsible for its large multilingual vocabulary. However, much of the character of ConceptNet comes from OMCS and the various games with a purpose, which express many different kinds of relations between terms, such as PartOf (“a wheel is part of a car”) and UsedFor (“a car is used for driving”)."

These generalized relations are similar in purpose to WordNet’s relations such as hyponym and meronym, as well as to the qualia of the Generative Lexicon theory (Pustejovsky 1991). ConceptNet’s edges are directed, but as a new feature in ConceptNet 5.5, some relations are designated as being symmetric, such as SimilarTo. The directionality of these edges is unimportant.\nThe core relations are:\n• Symmetric relations: Antonym, DistinctFrom, EtymologicallyRelatedTo, LocatedNear, RelatedTo, SimilarTo, and Synonym\n• Asymmetric relations: AtLocation, CapableOf, Causes, CausesDesire, CreatedBy, DefinedAs, DerivedFrom, Desires, Entails, ExternalURL, FormOf, HasA, HasContext, HasFirstSubevent, HasLastSubevent, HasPrerequisite, HasProperty, InstanceOf, IsA, MadeOf, MannerOf, MotivatedByGoal, ObstructedBy, PartOf, ReceivesAction, SenseOf, SymbolOf, and UsedFor\nDefinitions and examples of these relations appear in a page of the ConceptNet 5.5 documentation1.\nRelations with specific semantics, such as UsedFor and HasPrerequisite, tend to connect common words and phrases, while rarer words are connected by more general relations such as Synonym and RelatedTo.\nAn example of edges in ConceptNet, in a browsable interface that groups them by their relation expressed in natural English, appears in Figure 1."

      "text" : "ConceptNet represents terms in a standardized form. The text is Unicode-normalized in NFKC form2 using Python’s unicodedata implementation, lowercased, and split into non-punctuation tokens using the tokenizer in the Python package wordfreq (Speer et al. 2016), which builds on the standard Unicode word segmentation algorithm. The tokens are joined with underscores, and this text is prepended with the URI /c/lang, where lang is the BCP 47 language code3 for the language the term is in. As an example, the English term “United States” becomes /c/en/united states.\nRelations have a separate namespace of URIs prefixed with /r, such as /r/PartOf. These relations are given artificial names in English, but apply to all languages. The statement that was obtained in Portuguese as “O alimento é usado para comer” is still represented with the relation /r/UsedFor.\nThe most significant change from ConceptNet 5.4 and earlier is in the representation of terms. ConceptNet 5.4 required terms in English to be in lemmatized form, so that, for example, “United States” had to be represented as /c/en/unite state. In this representation, “drive” and “driving” were the same term, allowing the assertions (car, UsedFor, driving) and (drive, HasPrerequisite, have license) to be connected. ConceptNet 5.5 removes the lemmatizer, and instead relates inflections of words using the FormOf relation. The two assertions above are now linked by the third assertion (driving, FormOf, drive), and both “driving” and “drive” can be looked up in ConceptNet.\n1https://github.com/commonsense/ conceptnet5/wiki/Relations\n2http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/ 3https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47"

      "text" : "When building a knowledge graph, the decision of what a node should represent has significant effects on how the graph is used. It also has implications that can make linking and importing other resources non-trivial, because different resources make different decisions about their representation.\nIn ConceptNet, a node is a word or phrase of a natural language, often a common word in its undisambiguated form. The word “lead” in English is a term in ConceptNet, represented by the URI /c/en/lead, even though it has multiple meanings. The advantage of ambiguous terms is that they can be extracted easily from natural language, which is also ambiguous. This ambiguous representation is equivalent to that used by systems that learn distributional semantics from text.\nConceptNet’s representation allows for more specific, disambiguated versions of a term. The URI /c/en/lead/n refers to noun senses of the word “lead”, and is effectively included within /c/en/lead when searching or traversing ConceptNet, and linked to it with the implicit relation SenseOf. Many data sources provide information about parts of speech, allowing us to use this as a common representation that provides a small amount of disambiguation. Further disambiguation is allowed by the URI structure, but not currently used."

This newly-introduced relation preserves the provenance of the data and enables looking up what the untransformed data was. ConceptNet terms can also be represented as absolute URLs, so this allows ConceptNet to connect bidirectionally to the broader ecosystem of Linked Open Data."

For performance reasons, when building this matrix, we prune the ConceptNet graph by discarding terms connected to fewer than three edges.\nWe consider this matrix to represent terms and their contexts. In a corpus of text, the context of a term would be the terms that appear nearby in the text; here, the context is the other nodes it is connected to in ConceptNet. We can calculate word embeddings directly from this sparse matrix by following the practical recommendations of Levy, Goldberg, and Dagan (2015).\nAs in Levy et al., we determine the pointwise mutual information of the matrix entries with context distributional smoothing, clip the negative values to yield positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI), reduce the dimensionality of the result to 300 dimensions with truncated SVD, and combine the terms and contexts symmetrically into a single matrix of word embeddings.\nThis gives a matrix of word embeddings we call ConceptNet-PPMI. These embeddings implicitly represent the overall graph structure of ConceptNet, and allow us to compute the approximate connectedness of any pair of nodes.\nWe can expand ConceptNet-PPMI to restore the nodes that we pruned away, assigning them vectors that are the average of their neighboring nodes."

      "text" : "Having created embeddings from ConceptNet alone, we would now like to create a more robust set of embeddings that represents both ConceptNet and distributional word embeddings learned from text.\nRetrofitting (Faruqui et al. 2015) is a process that adjusts an existing matrix of word embeddings using a knowledge graph. Retrofitting infers new vectors qi with the objective of being close to their original values, q̂i, and also close to their neighbors in the graph with edges E, by minimizing this objective function:\nΨ(Q) = n∑ i=1 αi‖qi − q̂i‖2 + ∑ (i,j)∈E βij‖qi − qj‖2 \nFaruqui et al. give a simple iterative process to minimize this function over the vocabulary of the original embeddings.\nThe process of “expanded retrofitting” (Speer and Chin 2016) can optimize this objective over a larger vocabulary, including terms from the knowledge graph that do not appear in the vocabulary of the word embeddings. This effectively sets αi = 0 for terms whose original values are undefined. We set βij according to the weights of the edges in ConceptNet.\nThe particular benefit of expanded retrofitting to ConceptNet is that it can benefit from the multilingual connections in ConceptNet. It learns more about English words via their translations in other languages, and also gives these foreignlanguage terms useful embeddings in the same space as the English terms. The effect is similar to the work of Xiao and Guo (2014), who also propagate multilingual embeddings using crowd-sourced Wiktionary entries.\nWe add one more step to retrofitting, which is to subtract the mean of the vectors that result from retrofitting, then renormalize them to unit vectors. Retrofitting has a tendency to move all vectors closer to the vectors for highly-connected terms such as “person”. Subtracting the mean helps to ensure that terms remain distinguishable from each other."

This is particularly useful because it allows building on publicly-released matrices of embeddings whose input data is unavailable or difficult to acquire.\nAs described in the “Related Work” section, word2vec and GloVe both provide recommended pre-trained matrices. These matrices represent somewhat different domains of text and have complementary strengths, and the way that we can benefit from them the most is by taking both of them as input.\nTo do this, we apply retrofitting to both matrices, then find a globally linear projection that aligns the results on their common vocabulary. This process was inspired by Zhao, Hassan, and Auli (2015). We find the projection by concatenating the columns of the matrices and reducing them to 300 dimensions using truncated SVD. We then use this alignment to infer compatible embeddings for terms that are missing from one of the vocabularies.\nIn ongoing work, we are experimenting with additionally including distributional word embeddings from corpora of non-English text in this merger. Preliminary results show that this improves the multilingual performance of the embeddings.\nAfter retrofitting and merging, we have a labeled matrix of word embeddings whose vocabulary is derived from word2vec, GloVe, and the pruned ConceptNet graph.

A good semantic space will provide a ranking of relatedness that is highly correlated with the human gold-standard ranking, as measured by its Spearman correlation (ρ).\nMany gold standards of word relatedness are in common use. Here, we focus on MEN-3000 (Bruni, Tran, and Baroni 2014), a large crowd-sourced ranking of common words; RW (Luong, Socher, and Manning 2013), a ranking of rare words; WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al. 2001), a smaller evaluation that has been used as a benchmark for many methods; and MTurk-771 (Halawi et al. 2012), another crowd-sourced evaluation of a variety of words.\nTo avoid manually overfitting by designing our semantic space around a particular evaluation, we experimented using smaller development sets, holding out some test data until it was time to include results in this paper:\n• MEN-3000 is already divided into a 2000-item development set and a 1000-item test set. We use the results from the test set as the final results.\n• RW has no standard dev/test breakdown. We sampled 2/3 of its items as a development set and held out the other 1/3 (every third line of the file, starting with the third).\n• We used all of WordSim-353 in development. We examine its results both in English and in its Spanish translation (Hassan and Mihalcea 2009).\n• We did not use MTurk-771 in development, holding out the entire set as a final test, showing that ConceptNet Numberbatch performs well on a previously-unseen evaluation.\nWe use the Spanish WordSim-353 as an example of a prominent non-English evaluation, indicating that expanded retrofitting is sufficient to learn vectors for non-English languages, even when all the distributional semantics takes place in English. However, a thorough multilingual evaluation is beyond the scope of this paper; the systems we compare to have only made English vectors available, and it would add considerable complexity to the evaluation to reproduce other systems of multilingual embeddings, accounting for their various ways of handling morphology and OOV words."

The task of filling in missing values of a proportional analogy was common until recently on standardized tests such as the SAT. Now, it is popular as a way to show that a semantic space can approximate relationships\n4It is sometimes important to distinguish similarity from relatedness. For example, the term “coffee” is related to “mug”, but coffee is not similar to a mug. What a machine can learn from the connectivity of ConceptNet is focused on relatedness.\nbetween words, even without taking explicit relationships into account.\nMuch of the groundwork for evaluating systems’ ability to solve proportional analogies was laid by Peter Turney, including his method of Latent Relational Analysis (Turney 2006), which was quite effective at solving proportional analogies by repeatedly searching the Web for the words involved in them. A newer method called SuperSim (Turney 2013) does not require Web searching. These methods are evaluated on a dataset of 374 SAT questions that Turney and his collaborators have collected.\nMany of the best results on this evaluation have been achieved by Turney in his own work. One interesting system not by Turney is BagPack (Herdaǧdelen and Baroni 2009), which could learn about analogies either from unstructured text or from ConceptNet 4.\nSolving analogies over word embeddings is often described as comparing the difference b2 − a2 to b1 − a1 (Mikolov et al. 2013), but for the task of filling in the best pair for a2 and b2, it helps to take advantage of more of the structure of the question to provide more constraint than this single comparison.\nIn a sensible analogy, the words on the right side of the analogy will be related in some way to the words on the left side, so we should aim for some amount of relatedness between a1 and a2, and between b1 and b2, regardless of what the other terms are. Also, in many cases, a satisfying analogy will still make sense when it is transposed to “a1 is to a2 as b1 is to b2”. The analogy “fire : hot :: ice : cold”, for example, can be transposed to “fire : ice :: hot : cold”. Recognizing this structure helps in picking the best answer to difficult analogy questions.\nThis gives us three components that we can weigh to evaluate whether a pair (a2, b2) completes an analogy: their separate similarity to a1 and b1, the dot product of differences between the pairs, and the dot product of differences between the transposed pairs. The total weight does not matter, so we can put these together into a vector equation with two free parameters:\ns = a1 · a2 + b1 · b2 + w1(b2 − a2) · (b1 − a1) + w2(b2 − b1) · (a2 − a1)\nThe appropriate values of w1 and w2 depend on the nature of the relationships in the analogy questions, and also on how these relationships appear in the vector space. We optimize these parameters separately for each system we test, using grid search over a number of possible values so that each system can achieve its best performance. The grid search is performed on odd-numbered questions, holding out the even-numbered questions as a test set.\nThe weights found for ConceptNet Numberbatch 16.09 were w1 = 0.2 and w2 = 0.6. This indicates, surprisingly, that the comparisons being made by the transposed form of the analogy were often more important than the directly stated form of the analogy for choosing the best answer pair."

      "text" : "We have compared word embeddings that represent only distributional semantics (word2vec, GloVe, and LexVec), word embeddings that represent only relational knowledge (ConceptNet PPMI), and the combination of the two (ConceptNet Numberbatch), and we have shown that the whole is more than the sum of its parts.\nConceptNet continues to be important in a field that has come to focus on word embeddings, because word embeddings can benefit from what ConceptNet knows. ConceptNet can make word embeddings more robust and more correlated with human judgments, as shown by the state-of-theart results that ConceptNet Numberbatch achieves at matching human annotators on multiple evaluations.\nAny technique built on word embeddings should consider including a source of relational knowledge, or starting from a pre-trained set of word embeddings that has taken relational knowledge into account. One of the many goals of ConceptNet is to provide this knowledge in a convenient form that can be applied across many domains and many languages."

    "abstractText" : "Machine learning about language can be improved by supplying it with specific knowledge and sources of external information. We present here a new version of the linked open data resource ConceptNet that is particularly well suited to be used with modern NLP techniques such as word embeddings. ConceptNet is a knowledge graph that connects words and phrases of natural language with labeled edges. Its knowledge is collected from many sources that include expertcreated resources, crowd-sourcing, and games with a purpose. It is designed to represent the general knowledge involved in understanding language, improving natural language applications by allowing the application to better understand the meanings behind the words people use. When ConceptNet is combined with word embeddings acquired from distributional semantics (such as word2vec), it provides applications with understanding that they would not acquire from distributional semantics alone, nor from narrower resources such as WordNet or DBPedia. We demonstrate this with state-of-the-art results on intrinsic evaluations of word relatedness that translate into improvements on applications of word vectors, including solving SAT-style analogies.",
