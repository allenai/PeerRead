      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nSelection-based question answering is the task of selecting a segment of text, or interchangeably a context, from a provided set of contexts that best answers a posed question. Let us define a context, as a single document section, a group of contiguous sentences, or a single sentence. Selection-based question answering is subdivided into answer sentence selection and answer triggering. Answer sentence selection is defined as ranking sentences that answer a question higher than the irrelevant sentences where there is at least a single sentence that answers the question in a provided set of candidate sentences. Answer triggering is defined as selecting any number (n >= 0) of sentences from a set of candidate sentences that answers a question where the set of candidate sentences may or may not contain sentences that answer the question. Several corpora have been created for these tasks [1], [2], [3], allowing researchers to build effective question answering systems [4], [5], [6] with the aim of improving reading comprehension through understanding and reasoning of natural language. However, most of these datasets are constrained in the number of examples and scope of topics. We attempt to mitigate these limitations to allow for a more through reading comprehension evaluation of open-domain question answering systems.\nThis paper presents a new corpus with annotated question answering examples of various topics drawn from Wikipedia. An effective annotation scheme is proposed to create a large corpus that is both challenging and realistic. Questions are additionally annotated with its topic, type, and paraphrase that enable comprehensive analyses of system performance\non the answer sentence selection and answer triggering tasks. Two recent state-of-the-art systems based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks are implemented to analyze this corpus and to provide strong baseline measures for future work. In addition, our systems are evaluated on another dataset, WikiQA [2], for a fair comparison to previous work. Our analysis suggests extensive ways of evaluating selectionbased question answering, providing meaningful benchmarks to question answering systems. The contributions of this work include:1\n• Creating a new corpus for answer sentence selection and answer triggering (Section III). • Developing QA systems using the latest advances in neural networks (Section IV). • Analyzing various aspects of selection-based question answering (Section V)."

      "text" : "The TREC QA competition datasets have been a popular choice for evaluating answer sentence selection.2 [1] combined the TREC-[8-12] datasets for training and divided the TREC-13 dataset for development and evaluation. This dataset, known as QASent, has been used as the standard benchmark for answer sentence selection although it is rather small (277 questions with manually picked answer contexts). [2] introduced a lager dataset, WikiQA, consisting of questions collected from the user logs of the Bing search engine. Our corpus is similar to WikiQA but covers more diverse topics, consists of a larger number of questions (about 6 times larger for answer sentence selection and 2.5 times larger for answer triggering), and makes use of more contexts by extracting contexts from the entire article instead of from only the abstract. [3] distributed another dataset, InsuranceQA, including questions in the insurance domain. WikiQA introduced the task of answer triggering and was the only answer triggering dataset. Our corpus provides a new automatically generated answer triggering dataset.\nDue to increasing complexity in question answering, deep learning has become a popular trend in solving difficult problems.

Further, more convolutional neural network based frameworks have been proposed as solutions for question answering [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] Our convolutional neural network model is inspired by the previous work utilizing the tree-edit distance and the tree kernel [13], [14], [15], although we introduce a different way of performing subtree matching facilitating word embeddings. Our recurrent neural network models with attention are based on established state-of-the-art systems for answer sentence selection [16], [17]."

      "text" : "Four annotation tasks are conducted in sequence on Amazon Mechanical Turk for answer sentence selection (Tasks 1-4), and a single task is conducted for answer triggering using only Elasticsearch (Task 5; see Figure 1 for the overview).\nTask 1\nApproximately two thousand sections are randomly selected from the 486 articles in Section III-A. All the selected sections consist of 3 to 25 sentences; we found that annotators experienced difficulties accurately and timely annotating longer sections. For each section, annotators are instructed to generate a question that can be answered in one or more sentences in the provided section, and select the corresponding sentence or sentences that answer the question. The annotators are provided with the instructions, the topic, the article title, the section title, and the list of numbered sentences in the section (Table II).\nTask 2\nAnnotators are asked to create another set of ≈2K questions from the same selected sections excluding the sentences selected as answers in Task 1. The goal of Task 2 is to generate questions that can be answered from sentences different from those used to answer questions generated in the Task 1. The annotators are provided with the same information as in Task 1, except that the sentences used as the answer contexts in Task 1 are crossed out (line 1 in Table II). Annotators are instructed not to use these sentences to generate new questions.\nTask 3\nAlthough our instruction encourages the annotators to create questions in their own words, annotators will generate questions with some lexical overlap with the corresponding contexts. The intention of this task is to mitigate the effects of annotators’ tendency to generating questions with similar vocabulary and phrasing to answer contexts. This is a necessary step in creating a corpus that evaluates reading comprehension rather than ability to model word co-occurrences. The annotators are provided with the previously generated questions and answer contexts and are instructed to paraphrase these questions using different terms.\nTask 4\nMost questions generated by Tasks 1-3 are of high quality, that is they can be answered by a human when given the corresponding contexts; however, there are some questions that are ambiguous in meaning and difficult for humans to answer correctly. These difficult questions often incorrectly assume that the related sections are provided with the questions. For instance, it is impossible to answer the question from Task 3.1 in Table II unless the related section is provided with the question. These ambiguous questions are sent back to the annotators for revision.\nElasticsearch is used to find ambiguous questions,6 a Lucenebased open-source search engine. First, an inverted index of 8,481 sections is built, where each section is considered a document. Each question is queried to this search engine. If the answer context is not included within the top 5 sections in the search result, the question is considered ‘suspicious’ although it may not be ambiguous. Among 7,904 questions generated by Tasks 1-3, 1,338 of them are found to be suspicious. These questions are sent to the annotators, and rephrased by the annotators if deemed necessary.\nTask 5\nBy using the previously generated answer sentence selection data, the answer triggering corpus can be automatically generated again using Elasticsearch. To generate answer contexts for answer triggering, all 14M sections from the entire English\n6www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch\nWikipedia are indexed, and each question from Tasks 1-4 is queried. Every sentence in the top 5 highest scoring sections from Elasticsearch are collected as candidates, which may or may not include the answer context that resolves the question."

      "text" : "The entire annotation took about 130 hours, costing $770 in total; each mturk job took on average approximately 1 minute and costed about ¢10. A total of 7,904 questions were generated from Tasks 1-4, where 92.2% of them found their answers in single sentences. It is clear that Task 3 was effective in reducing the percentage of overlapping words between question and answer pairs (about 4%; Ωf in Table III). The questions from Task 3 can be used to develop paraphrasing models as well. Multiple pilot studies on different tasks were conducted to analyze quality and cost; Tasks 1-4 were proved to be the most effective in the pilot studies. Following [18], we paid incentives to those who submitted outstanding work, which improved the overall quality of our annotation.\nOur corpus could be compared to WikiQA that was created with the intent of providing a challenging dataset for selectionbased question answering [2]. Questions in this dataset were collected from the user logs of the Bing search engine, and associated with the specific sections in Wikipedia, namely the first sections known as the abstracts. We aim to provide a similar yet more exhaustive dataset by broadening the scope to all sections. A notable difference was found between these two corpora for overlapping words (about 11% difference), which was expected due to the artificial question generation in\nour scheme. Although questions taken from the search queries are more natural, real search queries are inacessible to most researchers. The new annotation scheme proposed here can prove useful for researchers needing to create a corpus for selection-based QA.\nOur answer triggering dataset contains 5 times more answer candidates per question than WikiQA because WikiQA includes only sections clicked on by users. Manual selection is eliminated from our framework, making our corpus more practical. In WikiQA, 40.76% of the questions have corresponding answer contexts for answer triggering, as compared to 39.25% in ours."

      "text" : "Our CNN model is motivated by [2]. First, a convolutional layer is applied on the image of text using the hyperbolic tangent activation function. The image consists of rows standing for consecutive words in two sentences, the question (q) and the answer candidate (a), where the words are represented by their embeddings [19]. For our experiments, we use the image of 80 rows (40 for question and answer, respectively). If any of the question or answer is longer than 40 tokens, the rest is being cut from the input. Next, the max pooling is applied,7 and the sentence vectors for q and a are generated. Unlike [2] who performed the dot product between these two vectors, we added another hidden layer to learn their weights. Finally, the sigmoid activation function is applied and the entire network is trained using the binary cross-entropy. Next, we use a logistic regression model, where the CNN score from the output layer is used as one of the features.\n7We also experimented with the average pooling as [2], which led to a marginally lower accuracy.\nOther features in the logistic regression are the number of overlapping words between q and a, say Ω, Ω normalized by the IDF, and the question length. While the logistic regression model could be merged directly with our CNN model, it has been empirically shown that it is more effective to construct this last phase as a separate model.\nInput: T : a set of co-occurring words between a question and answer. Dq, Da: sets of slices for a question and answer. fm: a metrics function. fc: a comparator function. Output: Sdep: A triplet of dependency similarity. Sdep ← [0, 0, 0]; foreach word woi in T do\npqi ←getParent(D q i ) pai ←getParent(Dai ) Sdep[0]← Sdep[0] + fc(pqi , pai ) Sqi ←getSiblings(D q i ) Sai ←getSiblings(Dai ) vals← [] foreach sibling sqj in S q i do\nforeach sibling sak in Sai do vals.append(fc(s q j , s a k))\nend end Sdep[1]← Sdep[1] + fm(vals) Cqi ←getChildren(D q i ) Cai ←getChildren(Dai ) vals← [] foreach child cqj in C q i do\nforeach child cak in Cai do vals.append(fc(c q j , c a k))\nend end Sdep[2]← Sdep[2] + fm(vals)\nend Algorithm 1: Algorithm of our subtree matching mechanism\nFor the answer sentence selection task, the predictions for each question are treated as a ranking and the MAP and MRR scores are being calculated (Section V-B). On the other hand, in the answer triggering task (Section V-C) a threshold is applied on each predicted question by the logistic regression; the candidate with the highest score is considered the answer if it is above the threshold found during development; otherwise, the model assumes no existence of the answer context in this document for that question. Figure 2 shows the overview of our CNN and LR model.\nSubtree Matching: We propose a subtree matching mechanism for measuring the contextual similarity between two sentences. All sentences are automatically parsed by the NLP4J dependency parser [20]. First, a set of co-occurring words between q and a, say T , is created. For each woi ∈ T , woi ’s parents (pqi , p a i ), siblings (S q i , S a i ), and children (C q i , C a i ) are extracted from the dependency slices of q and a. When the word-forms are used as the comparator, fc(x, y) returns 1 if x and y have the same form; otherwise, 0. When the word embeddings are used as the comparator, fc(x, y) returns the cosine similarity between x and y. The function fm takes a list of scores and returns either the sum, avg, or max of the scores. Finally, the triplet Sdep is used as the additional features to the logistic regression model. Algorithm 1 presents the entire process in detail. Although our subtree matching mechanism adds only 3 more features, our experiments show significant performance gains for both the answer sentence selection and answer triggering strengthening our hypothesis that to solve question answering problems more effectively, deeper contextual similarity is required."

      "text" : "Our RNN model is based on the bidirectional Long ShortTerm Memory (LSTM) using attentive pooling introduced by [17], except that our network uses a gated recurrent unit (GRU; [21]) instead of LSTM. From our preliminary experiments, we found that GRU converged faster than LSTM while achieving similar performance for these tasks. Let wqi ∈ q, waj ∈ a, where q is the question and a is the answer candidate, and e(w) returns the embedding of a word w. Embeddings are encoded by a single bidirectional GRU g that consists of the forward (−→g ) and the backward (←−g ) GRUs, each with h hidden units. Given w, g outputs the vector concatenation of the hidden states of −→g and ←−g :\ng(e(w)) = −→g (e(w))||←−g (e(w))\nLet c = 2 · h represent the dimensionality of the output of g. Then, sentence embedding matrices Q ∈ R|q|×c and A ∈ R|a|×c are generated by g as Qi = g(e(wqi )) and Aj = g(e(w a j )).\nBoth the attentive pooling and one-way attention models below are trained by minimizing the pairwise hinge ranking loss. In addition, RMSProp is used for the optimization and the `2 weight penalty is applied on all parameters except for embeddings. All network parameters except the embeddings are initialized using orthogonal initialization.\nAttentive Pooling: Attentive Pooling (AP) is a frameworkindependent two-way attention mechanism that jointly learns a similarity measure between q and a. AP learns the similarity measure over the hidden states of q and a. The AP matrix H ∈ R|q|×|a| has a bilinear form and is followed by a hyperbolic tangent non-linearity, where U ∈ Rc×c:\nH = tanh(QTUA)\nThe importance vectors hq ∈ R|q| and ha ∈ R|a| are generated from the column-wise and row-wise max pooling over H , respectively:\n[hq]j = max i∈[1,|q|] [Hj,i]\nThe normalized attention vectors σq and σa are created by applying the softmax activation function on hq and ha:\nσq = exp([hq]j)∑\ni∈[1,|q|] exp([hq]i)\nThe final representations rq = Qσq and ra = Aσa for q and a are created using the dot products of the sentence representations and their corresponding attention vectors. The score is computed for each pair using cosine similarity:\ns(q, a) = rqT ra\n‖rq‖‖ra‖\nOne-Way Attention: Our one-way attention model is a simplified version of the attentive pooling model above, which is most similar to the global attention model introduced by [22]. We did not use the one-way attention from [16] to avoid deviating the attention mechanism significantly. Replacing Q with Q|q|, the last hidden state of g, H becomes the importance vector h. Again, we create the normalized attention vector σa by applying the softmax activation function. The final representations are rq = Q|q| and ra = Aσa."

Two metrics are used, mean average precision (MAP) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR), for the evaluation of this task. CNN0 is our replication of the best model in [2]. CNN1 and CNN2 are the CNN models using the subtree matching in Section IV-A, where the comparator of fc is either the word form or the word embedding respectively, and fm = avg. The subtree matching models consistently outperforms the baseline model. Note that among the three metrics of fm, avg, sum, and max, avg outperformed the others in our experiments for the answer sentence selection task although no significant differences were found. RNN0 and RNN1 are the RNN models using the one-way attention and the attentive pooling in Section IV-B. Note that RNN1 converged much faster than RNN0 at the same learning rate and fixed number of parameters in our experiments, implying that two-way attention assists with optimization.\nIt is interesting to see how CNN1 and RNN0 outperform CNN2 and RNN1 respectively on the development set, but not on the evaluation set. This result may be explained by the larger percentage of overlapping words in the development set, enabling the simpler models perform more effectively.\nTable VI shows the results achieved by our models on SelQA. CNN2 outperforms the other CNN models, indicating the power of subtree matching coupled with word embeddings. RNN1 outperforms RNN0, indicating the importance of attention over the questions. Unlike the results on WikiQA in Table V, CNN2 and RNN0 show the best performance on both the development and evaluation sets, implying the robustness of these models on our corpus.\nTable VII shows the MRR scores from our models on SelQA with respect to different topics. All models show strength on topics such as ‘Country’ and ‘Historical Events’, which is comprehensible since questions in these topics tend to be deterministic. On the other hand, most models show weakness on topics such as ‘TV’, ‘Arts’, or ‘Music’. This may be due to the fact that not many overlapping words are found between question and answer pairs in these documents, which also consist of many segments caused by bullet points.\nTable VIII shows comparisons between questions from Tasks 1 and 2 (original) and Task 3 (paraphrase) in Section III-B. As expected, noticeable performance drop is found for the paraphrased questions, which have much fewer overlapping words to the answer contexts than the original questions.\nTable IX shows the MRR scores with respect to question types. The CNN models show strength on the ‘who’ type, whereas the RNN models show strength on the ‘when’ type. Each model varies on showing their weakness, which we will explore in the future. Finally, Figure 4 shows the performance difference with respect to question and section lengths. All models except for RNN0 tend to perform better as questions become longer. This makes sense since longer questions are usually more informative. On the other hand, models generally perform worse as sections become longer, which also makes sense because the models have to select the answer contexts from larger pools."

Broadly speaking, the answer sentence selection task is a raking problem, while answer triggering is a binary classification task with additional constraints. Thus, the F1-score on the question level was proposed by [2] as the evaluation for this task, which we follow.\nTable X shows the answer triggering results on WikiQA. Note that RNN0 using one-way attention was dropped for these experiments because it did not show comparable performance against the others for this task. Interestingly, the CNN model\nwith fm = max outperformed the other metrics for answer triggering, although avg was found to be the most effective for answer sentence selection. The CNN subtree matching models consistently gave over 2% improvements to the baseline model.\nIn addition, CNN3 was experimented by retraining word embeddings (emb+), which performed slightly worse on the development set, but gave another 1.68% improvement on the evaluation set.8 RNN1 showed a very similar result to [2], which was surprising since it performed so much better for answer sentence selection. This can be due to a lack of hyper-parameter optimization, which we leave as a future work.\nTable XI shows the answer triggering results on SelQA. Unlike the results on WikiQA (Table X), CNN2 outperforms CNN3 on our corpus. On the other hand, RNN1 shows a similar score to [2] as it does on WikiQA.

The worst performing topics are ‘TV’, ‘Music’ and ‘Art’. Such a noticeable difference might be caused by the unusual semantic sentence constructions of the text. Sections in these categories often contain listings, bullet-pointed texts etc., which is problematic for the models to properly take care of. How to correctly understand and solve question from such context will be a challenge to the future systems. Also, interestingly, the standard deviation is much smaller for RNN1 (3.9%) compared to the CNN models (10-12%) although RNN1’s overall performance is lower.\nTable XIII shows the accuracies on SelQA with respect to paraphrasing, which is similar to the trend found in Table VIII for answer sentence selection.\nTable XIV shows the accuracies on SelQA with respect to question types. Interestingly, each model shows different strength on different types, which may suggest a possibility of an ensemble model. Finally, Figure 5 shows the performance difference with respect to question and section lengths for the answer triggering task. All the models tend to perform better as questions become longer. Similarly as in the answer sentence selection task, since longer questions are more informative, it is\nunderstandable. Interestingly, once the section becomes longer, the accuracy increases. We hypothesize that such a behavior might be caused by the fact that it is easier for the models to decide whether the context of the section is the same as the context of the question when there is more information (sentences) in the section. Thus, this phenomenon is related to the task of answer triggering, where the model not only choose the sentence with the answer, but must decide if the context matches first."

Our annotation scheme is composed of a series of crowdsourcing tasks with a view to more effectively utilize crowdsourcing in the creation of question answering datasets in various domains.
