{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Differentiable Canonical Correlation Analysis", "abstract": "Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) computes maximally-correlated  linear projections of two modalities. We propose Differentiable CCA, a  formulation of CCA that can be cast as a layer within a multi-view  neural network. Unlike Deep CCA, an earlier extension of CCA to  nonlinear projections, our formulation enables gradient flow through the  computation of the CCA projection matrices, and free choice of the final  optimization target. We show the effectiveness of this approach in  cross-modality retrieval experiments on two public image-to-text  datasets, surpassing both Deep CCA and a multi-view network with  freely-learned projections. We assume that Differentiable CCA could be a  useful building block for many multi-modality tasks.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The authors propose to combine a CCA objective with a downstream loss.  This is a really nice and natural idea.  However, both the execution and presentation leave a lot to be desired in the current version of the paper.\n\nIt is not clear what the overall objective is.  This was asked in a pre-review question but the answer did not fully clarify it for me.  Is it the sum of the CCA objective and the final (top-layer) objective, including the CCA constraints?  Is there some interpolation of the two objectives?  \n\nBy saying that the top-layer objective is \"cosine distance\" or \"squared cosine distance\", do you really mean you are just minimizing this distance between the matched pairs in the two views?  If so, then of course that does not work out of the box without the intervening CCA layer:  You could minimize it by setting all of the projections to a single point.  A better comparison would be against a contrastive loss like the Hermann & Blunsom one mentioned in the reviewer question, which aims to both minimize the distance for matched pairs and separate mismatched ones (where \"mismatched\" ones can be uniformly drawn, or picked in some cleverer way).

We \nunderstand that we did not manage to clearly present the central idea of \nour work.\nWe do *not* combine the CCA objective (i.e., maximizing the correlation \nbetween the two hidden representations, the so-called Trace Norm \nObjective in Deep CCA) with another objective. We use CCA as a \ntransformation anywhere within a network that optimally correlates two \nviews, but we do not optimize the network towards maximal correlation as \ndone in Deep CCA. Instead, we apply the CCA transformations in the \nforward pass (not done in Deep CCA) and compute an arbitrary loss \nfunction on the transformed data.\nOur use of CCA can be compared to Batch Normalization (BN): BN provides \na transformation applicable anywhere within a network that normalizes a \nsingle view, and allows backpropagation of gradients through the \nnormalization procedure. Similarly, we backpropagate gradients through \nthe CCA procedure, where the gradients can be derived from any loss \nfunction operating on the optimally-correlated views produced by CCA.\nWe are grateful for all your comments, and will rewrite our manuscript \nto submit it elsewhere.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "04 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Unclear about the contribution ", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "It is not clear to me at all what this paper is contributing.

The authors need to justify why the original gradient computation is problematic for what the authors are trying to achieve. From the authors' response to my question 2, it seems they still use SVD of T, so I am not sure if the proposed method has advantage in computational efficiency.\n\nIn terms of paper organization, it is better to describe the retrieval objective earlier than in the experiments.
