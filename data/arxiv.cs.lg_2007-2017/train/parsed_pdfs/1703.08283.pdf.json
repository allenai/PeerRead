      "text" : "When faced with a classification job, an analyst will often want to select the best methods for the application; this can be a daunting task since there are a large number of methods available. Users will need insights, such as rankings of the methods, to guide them to make the best selection, and to go through the selection process in an easy-to-handle manner. Several studies on the experimental evaluation of various methods for classification have been reported recently (e.g., Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014; Van Hulse, Khoshgoftaar and Napolitano, 2007). Reference (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) is a main representative of such studies, which used 121 data sets to evaluate 179 classifiers.\nclassification methods by considering all data sets in one pool – they did not distinguish the data sets based on their hardness. Moreover, there was no systematic study to identify which classification benchmark data sets are hard for traditional classification methods, and there were no rankings of methods based on their performance on hard data sets only. Filling these gaps is important, as the identified hard data sets can help future studies to develop new classification algorithms to complement existing classification algorithms, and the ranking of methods on hard data sets can help users select the best method when they are working with potentially hard data sets. We plan to fill this gap in this study.\nThis study will evaluate both classification algorithms and feature selection methods in\ncombination. Specifically, it will identify hard data sets for which no combinations of representative classification algorithms and feature selection methods can produce accurate classification models. Moreover, the study will use the area under the ROC (AUC) and F-Measure, instead of the accuracy measure (as was done in Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014), to evaluate the performance of classification models. These measures were chosen based on the recent consensus that the accuracy measure has significant shortcomings when compared with the above two measures, especially AUC.\nTo identify a list of benchmark data sets that are hard for representative classification and\nfeature selection methods, we perform a systematical evaluation of 54 combinations, involving nine representative classification algorithms and six commonly used feature selection methods, on 129 data sets from the UCI repository. We note that some data sets with known high classification accuracy based on results of Fernández-Delgado et al. (2014) were excluded in our experiments.\nFor ease of discussion, a data set for classification will be called hard if none of the 54\ncombinations can achieve an AUC over 0.8 and none of the 54 combinations can achieve an F-Measure value over 0.8; it is called easy otherwise. A total of 17 out of the 129 data sets were found to be hard in our experiments.\nThis paper also compares the performance of different methods separately on the hard\ndata sets and on the easy data sets. This was done based on their performance on data sets for which complete results were obtained for all of the 54 combinations. It turns out that the method rankings resulting from our experiments are somehow different from those in the literature and hence they offer new insights on method selection.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the classification\nalgorithms and feature selection methods used in this study. Section 3 describes the data sets included in this study. Section 4 gives the experiment settings and the evaluation measures used. Section 5 presents the experimental results and the associated analysis. Section 6 concludes the paper."

In particular, reference (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) showed Random Forest and SVM are often better than the others, and reference (Wyner et al. 2015) gave a list of common-used successful classification algorithms. We selected Boosting, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression and SVM, as the representatives of existing classification algorithms. Table 1 shows the correspondence of classification algorithms and their implementations in Weka that we used in experiments. Some of the classification algorithms given in Table 1 have multiple versions due to different parameter settings, yielding a total of nine classification algorithms (discussed below).\nTo better evaluate the six algorithms, two J48 and three SVM classifiers were examined.\nFor J48, we examined the classifier using the default parameter values, and the other using no pruning and using Laplace smoothing (J48(-U-A)). The three LibSVM classifiers are SVM using linear (SVM-LN), polynomial (SVM-PN) and radial basis function (SVM-RBF) kernels respectively. For IBk, we used K=10 and crossValidate=True, with which the system will find the optional K value between 1 and 10. More details are given below.\n1) AdaBoost uses the M1 method (Freund and Schapire, 1996) with DecisionStump as\nbase classifiers.\n2) J48 implements a pruned C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) decision tree algorithm, with\nparameters confidenceFactor=0.25 and minNumObj=2.\n3) J48(-U-A) implements a unpruned C4.5 decision tree algorithm with Laplace-based\nsmoothening.\n4) RF builds a forest of random trees (Breiman, 2001), with parameters\nbagSizePercent=100 and unlimited depth.\nselecting the optimal value of K between 1 and 10 based on cross-validation.\n6) LOG builds and uses a multinomial logistic regression model with a ridge estimator\n(Cessie and Houwelingen, 1992), with parameter ridge=1.0E-8.\n7) SVM-LN uses the LibSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2011) with linear kernel, with\nparameters SVMType=C-SVC and cost=1.0.\n8) SVM-PN uses the LibSVM library with polynomial kernel, with parameters\nSVMType=C-SVC, cost =1.0, degree=3, gamma=0.0 and coef0=0.\n9) SVM-RBF uses the LibSVM library with radial basis function kernel, with\nparameters SVMType=C-SVC, cost=1.0 and gamma=0.0."

      "text" : "Feature selection methods are used to remove irrelevant, redundant, or noisy attributes, with the aim of speeding up the computation and improving the accuracy (Li et al., 2009; Liu and Yu, 2005; Dash and Liu, 1997). Our experiments examine the effectiveness of feature selection methods when used with various classification algorithms.\nMany feature selection methods have been proposed, each with its own pros and cons.\nWe selected the following filter methods because they are commonly used (Liu and Yu, 2005; Robnik-Šikonja and Kononenko, 2003): the correlation based method, the information gain based method and the relief-f method. We used Weka’s implementation of the three feature selection methods.\nIn order to better evaluate these methods, we used two different parameter settings, which\ndictate how many features are selected, as described below.\n(1) Let IG1 (similarly RLF1) denote the version of the Information Gain method\n(similarly Relief-F) that works to select 80 percent of the features if the total number of features of a given data set is no more than 50, and to select 40 features if the total number of features is more than 50. (2) Let IG2 (similarly RLF2) denote the version of the method that works to select 60\npercent of the features if the total number of features of a given data set is no more than 50, and to select 25 features if the total number of features is more than 50. For ease of discussion, we consider “no attribute selection” as a feature selection method.\nTherefore, a total of 6 feature selection methods are considered.\nWe now give some more details on the feature selection methods.\n1) CFS uses CfsSubsetEval as the attribute evaluator to evaluate the worth of a subset of\nattributes by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree of redundancy between them, and uses BestFirst as the search method to searches the space of attribute subsets by greedy hill-climbing augmented with a backtracking facility.\n2) IG1 uses InfoGainAttributeEval as the attribute evaluator to evaluate the worth of\nattributes by measuring the information gain with respect to the class, and uses Ranker as the search method. If the total number of features is no more than 50, IG1 selects 80 percent of the features, and IG1 selects 40 features otherwise.\n3) IG2 differs from IG1 as follows. It selects 60 percent of the features if the total number\nof features is no more than 50, and it selects 25 features otherwise.\nattributes by repeatedly sampling an instance and considering the value of the given attribute for the nearest instance belonging to the same and different classes. It uses Ranker as the search method. It selects 60 percent of the features if the total number of features is no more than 50, and it selects 25 features otherwise.\n5) RLF2 differs from RLF1 as follows. It selects 60 percent of the features if the total\nnumber of features is no more than 50, and it selects 25 features otherwise.\n6) NO means “no attribute selection is performed”."

(a) From the data sets studied in (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014), we first selected 34\ndata sets such that the maximum reported accuracy of (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) is below 0.8. (This saved our effort by eliminating the data sets having high known accuracy.) Then we added another 11 data sets that are variations (sharing the same data set name at UCI) of some of the 34 data sets. As a result, this group has a total of 45 data sets.\n(b) Because (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) only dealt with UCI data sets dated before\nMarch 2013, we examined the 91 UCI data sets whose dates are between January 2013 and June 2016. From these we selected 32 and excluded the other 59 for reasons such as “too many instances”, “having no classification attribute”, “having complex data structure requiring preprocessing”, “having no data”, and “inaccessible”. Some data sources provide multiple versions (e.g. 15 for actrecog, 16 for gesture, 10 for mhealth, 2 for student); we took each version as a different data set (e.g. 15 data sets from the 15 versions of actrecog). This group has a total of 71 data sets.\n(c) We also examined data sets having no dates marked at UCI, from which 10 data sets\nare included (the others are excluded due to complex data). Among the 10 data sets, ballon has 4 versions, yielding extra data sets. So this group has a total of 13 data sets.\nAmong the 129 data sets from the three groups, there were 31 (listed in Table XI in\nTable 2. One of the 31 came from the (a) group and the other 30 from the (b) group."

For each fold of each data set, a classification model is built from the other 9 folds, using each of the 54 combinations involving nine classifiers and six feature selection methods.\nAs widely noted in the literature, the simple accuracy measure may be not adequate for\nimbalanced data sets. As some data sets used in our experiments are not balanced, we did not use the accuracy measure; we used the AUC and F-Measure measures instead.\nAUC is equivalent to the probability that the underlying classifier will rank a randomly\nchosen positive instance higher than a randomly chose negative instance (Fawcett, 2006). It is also called ROC Area in Weka. The F-Measure is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. AUC has several desirable properties as a classification performance measure, such as being decision threshold independent and invariant to a priori class probabilities. AUC is widely accepted as one of the best ways to evaluate a classifier’s performance (Bradley, 1997) and it has been widely used to measure the performance in classification. We chose to include the F-Measure, in order to complement the AUC, and also to indicate the strength of the classifier in terms of Precision and Recall. (Reference (Hand, 2009) pointed out that for some situations, namely when the ROC curves cross, AUC has some weakness and it may give potentially misleading information.)"

The slope of the curve in the lower panel is fairly steep: the maximum average AUC is 0.91, the minimum average AUC is 0.673, and their difference is 0.237; the maximum average F-Measure is 0.817, the minimum average F-Measure is 0.579, and their difference is 0.238. In summary, the difference among the performance of the classification algorithms for the 17 hard data sets is fairly small; in contrast, the difference for the easy data sets is fairly large.\nWe note that RF is the best or the second best for both easy and hard data sets, which is\nin strong agreement with the ranking of algorithms provided by (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014). However, Figure 3 shows that SVM-PN is the last one in the rank for both easy and hard data sets, which is very different from the ranking give by (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) (which found SVM to be the second best classification algorithm). There are at least three potential reasons for the disagreement: We used AUC and F-Measure whereas (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) used accuracy. (2) In our study we excluded a number of\n(by any of the classification algorithms) and we included some data sets not studied in (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014). (3) In our ranking, we separated data sets into a hard pool and an easy pool, whereas (Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014) considered all data sets in one pool.\nTable 8 shows the average AUC and average F-Measure for the six feature selection\nmethods on the hard data sets (left table) and the easy data sets (right table). For the hard data sets, the NO (no attribute selection) and IG1 methods are the best; for the easy data sets, RLF1 is the best, followed by NO (no attribute selection). We note that the average AUC and average F-Measure of NO are all just 0.002 below those of RLF1.\nMore specifically, for the hard data sets (Table 8, left), the maximum average AUC is\n0.607 and the minimum average AUC is 0.593, and the difference is just 0.014; the maximum average F-Measure is 0.589, the minimum average F-Measure is 0.575, and the difference is just 0.014. For the easy data sets (Table 8, right), the maximum average AUC is 0.8, the minimum average AUC is 0.783, and the difference is 0.017; the maximum average F-Measure is 0.701, the minimum average F-Measure is 0.688, and the difference is 0.013. The above suggests that there is little difference on the classification performance whether feature selection methods are used, or which feature selection methods are used, based on average performance. We must note that the above statement is based on average performance over a large number of data sets, and the experiments used default parameter settings without data set-specific parameter tuning. As noted above, the exclusion of a fairly large number of data sets with known high classification accuracy may also contribute to the above findings."

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to give a list of hard benchmark data sets in the machine learning literature, and to rank classification algorithms by considering their performance on hard data sets.

We are not sure whether the first data set is a hard data set or not, because its maximum AUC and maximum F-Measure are all less than 0.8 based on the partial results.\nData set Instance Attribute Classifier Runtime(seconds)\npima 768 9 SVM-PN 193623\ncrx 690 16 SVM-PN 105864\nflags 194 29 SVM-LN 96216\nanneal 798 39 RF 19652"

In this paper, a data set for classification is called hard if none of the 54 combinations can achieve an AUC over 0.8 and none of them can achieve an F-Measure value over 0.8; it is called easy otherwise. A total of 17 out of the 129 data sets were found to be hard in that sense. This paper also compares the performance of different methods, and it produces rankings of classification methods, separately on the hard data sets and on the easy data sets. This paper is the first to rank methods separately for hard data sets and for easy data sets. It turns out that the classifier rankings resulting from our experiments are somehow different from those in the literature and hence they offer new insights on method selection.",
