      "text" : "Neural network models are capable of generating extremely natural sounding conversational interactions. Nevertheless, these models have yet to demonstrate that they can incorporate content in the form of factual information or entity-grounded opinion that would enable them to serve in more task-oriented conversational applications. This paper presents a novel, fully data-driven, and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses without slot filling. We generalize the widely-used SEQ2SEQ approach by conditioning responses on both conversation history and external “facts”, allowing the model to be versatile and applicable in an open-domain setting. Our approach yields significant improvements over a competitive SEQ2SEQ baseline. Human judges found that our outputs are significantly more informative."

      "text" : "Conversational agents such as Alexa, Siri, and Cortana have been increasingly popular, as they facilitate interaction between people and their devices. There is thus a growing need to build systems that can respond seamlessly and appropriately, and the task of conversational response generation has recently become an active area of research in natural language processing.\nRecent work (Ritter et al., 2011; Sordoni et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015) has shown that it is possible to train conversational models in an end-to-end and completely\n* This work was conducted at Microsoft.\ndata-driven fashion, without hand-coding. However, these fully data-driven systems lack grounding in the real world and do not have access to any external knowledge (textual or structured), which makes it difficult to respond substantively. Fig. 1 illustrates the difficulty: while an ideal response would directly reflect on the entities mentioned in the query (user input), neural models produce responses that, while conversationally appropriate, seldom include factual content. This contrasts with traditional dialog systems, which can easily inject entities and facts into responses using slotfilling, but often at the cost of significant handcoding, making such systems difficult to scale to new domains or tasks.\nThe goal of this paper is to benefit from both lines of research—fully data-driven and grounded in external knowledge. The tie to external data is critical, as the knowledge that is needed to make the conversation useful is often stored in nonconversational data, such as Wikipedia, books reviews on Goodreads, and restaurant reviews on Foursquare. While conversational agents can learn\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n01 93\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nF eb\n2 01\n7\nthe backbone of human conversations from millions of conversations (Twitter, Reddit, etc.), we rely on non-conversational data to infuse relevant knowledge in conversation with users based on the context. More fundamentally, this line of research also targets more useful conversations. While prior data-driven conversational models have been essentially used as chitchat bots, access to external data can help users make better decisions (e.g., recommendation or QA systems) or accomplish specific tasks (e.g., task-completion agents).\nThis paper presents a novel, fully datadriven, and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses. It offers a framework that generalizes the SEQ2SEQ approach (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Sutskever et al., 2014) of most previous neural conversation models, as it naturally combines conversational and non-conversational data via multi-task learning (Caruana, 1998; Liu et al., 2015). The key idea of this approach is that it not only conditions responses based on conversation history (Sordoni et al., 2015), but also on external “facts” that are relevant to the current context (for example, Foursquare entries as in Fig. 1). Our approach only requires a way to ground external information based on conversation context (e.g., via simple entity name matching), which makes it highly versatile and applicable in an open-domain setting. This allowed us to train our system at a very large scale using 23M social media conversations and 1.1M Foursquare tips. The trained system showed significant improvements over a competitive large-scale SEQ2SEQ baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, fully data-driven neural conversation model that effectively exploits external knowledge, and it does so\nwithout explicit slot filling."

      "heading" : "2 Grounded Response Generation",
      "text" : "A primary challenge in building fully data-driven conversation models is that most of the world’s knowledge is not represented in any existing conversational datasets. While these datasets (Serban et al., 2015) have grown dramatically in size thanks in particular to social media (Ritter et al., 2011), this data is still very far from containing discussions of every entry in Wikipedia, Foursquare, Goodreads, or IMDB. This problem considerably limits the appeal of existing datadriven conversation models, as they are bound to respond evasively or deflectively as in Fig. 1, especially with regard to those entities that are poorly represented in the conversational training data. On the other hand, even when such conversational data representing most entities of interest did exist, we would still face challenges as such huge dataset would be difficult to be used for model training, and many conversational patterns exhibited in the data (e.g., for similar entities) would be redundant.\nOur approach aims to avoid redundancy and attempts to better generalize from existing conversational data, as illustrated in Fig. 2. While the conversations in the figure are about specific venues, products, and services, conversational patterns are general and equally applicable to other entities. The learned conversational behaviors could be used to, e.g., recommend other products and services. A traditional dialog system would use predefined slots to fill conversational backbone (bold text) with content; here, we present a more robust and scalable approach.\nIn order to infuse the response with factual information relevant to the conversational context,\nwe propose a knowledge-grounded model architecture depicted in Fig. 3. First, we have available a large collection of world facts,1 which is a large collection of raw text entries (e.g., Foursquare, Wikipedia, or Amazon reviews) indexed by named entities as keys. Then, given a conversational history or source sequence S, we identify the “focus” in S, which is the text span (one or more entities) based on which we form a query to link to the facts. This focus can either be identified using keyword matching (e.g., a venue, city, or product name), or detected using more advanced methods such as entity linking or named entity recognition. The query is then used to retrieve all contextually relevant facts: F = {f1, ..., fk}.2 Finally, both conversation history and relevant facts are fed into a neural architecture that features distinct encoders for conversation history and facts. We will detail this architecture in the subsections below.\nThis knowledge-grounded approach is more general than SEQ2SEQ response generation, as it avoids the need to learn the same conversational pattern for each distinct entity that we care about. In fact, even if a given entity (e.g., @pizzalibretto in Fig. 2) is not part of our conversational training data and therefore out-of-vocabulary, our approach is still able to rely on retrieved facts to generate an appropriate response. This also implies that we can enrich our system with new facts without the need to retrain the full system.\nWe train our system using multi-task learning (Luong et al., 2015) as a way of combining conversational data that is naturally associated with external data (e.g., discussions about restaurants\n1For presentation purposes, we refer to these items as “facts”, but a “fact” here is simply any snippet of authored text, which may contain subjective or inaccurate information.\n2In our work, we use a simple keyword-based IR engine to retrieve relevant facts from the full collection; more details are provided in Sec. 3.\nand other businesses as in Fig. 2), and less informal exchanges (e.g., a response to hi, how are you). More specifically, our multi-task setup contains two types of tasks:\n(1) one purely conversational, where we expose the model without fact encoder with (S,R) training examples, where S represents the conversation history and R is the response; (2) the other task exposes the full model with ({f1, . . . , fk, S}, R) training examples.\nThis decoupling of the two training conditions offer several advantages, including: First, it allows us to pre-train the conversation-only dataset separately, and start multi-task training (warm start) with a dialog encoder and decoder that already learned the backbone of conversations. Second, it gives us the flexibility to expose different kind of conversational data in the two tasks. Finally, one interesting option is to replace the response in task (2) with one of the facts (R = fi), which makes task (2) similar to an autoencoder and helps produce responses that are even more contentful. We will discuss the different ways we apply multi-task learning in practice in greater detail in Sec. 4."

Both encoder and decoder are recurrent neural network (RNN) models: an RNN that encodes a variable-length input string into a fixed-length vector representation and an RNN that decodes the vector representation into a variable-length output string. This part of our model is almost identical to prior conversational SEQ2SEQ models, except that we use gated recurrent units (GRU) (Chung et al., 2014) instead of LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) cells. Encoders and decoders in sequence-to-sequence models sometimes share weights in monolingual tasks, but do not do so in the present model, nor do they share word embeddings."

      "text" : "The Facts Encoder of Fig. 3 is similar to the Memory Network model first proposed by (Weston et al., 2014; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). It uses\nan associative memory for modeling the facts relevant to a particular problem—in our case, an entity mentioned in a conversation–then retrieves and weights these facts based on the user input and conversation history to generate an answer. Memory network models are widely used in Question Answering to make inferences based on the facts saved in the memory (Weston et al., 2015).\nIn our adaptation of memory networks, we use an RNN encoder to turn the input sequence (conversation history) into a vector, instead of a bag of words representation as used in the original memory network models. This enables us to better exploit interlexical dependencies between different parts of the input, and makes this memory network model (facts encoder) more directly comparable to a SEQ2SEQ model.\nMore formally, we are given an input sentence S = {s1, s2, ..., sn}, and a fact set F = {f1, f2, ..., fk} that are relevant to the conversation history. The RNN encoder reads the input string word by word and updates its hidden state. After reading the whole input sentence the hidden state of the RNN encoder, u is the summary of the input sentence. By using an RNN encoder, we have a rich representation for a source sentence.\nLet us assume u is a d dimensional vector and ri is the bag of words representation of fi with dimension v. Based on (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) we have:\nmi = Ari (1) ci = Cri (2)\npi = softmax(uTmi) (3)\no = k∑\ni=1\npici (4)\nû = o+ u (5)\nWhere A,C ∈ Rd×v are the parameters of the memory network. Then, unlike the original version of the memory network, we use an RNN decoder that is good for generating the response. The hidden state of the RNN is initialized with ûwhich is a symmetrization of input sentence and the external facts, to predict the response sentence R word by word.\nAs alternatives to summing up facts and dialog encodings in equation 5, we also experimented with other operations such as concatenation, but summation seemed to yield the best results. The memory network model of (Weston et al., 2014)\ncan be defined as a multi-layer structure. In this task, however, 1-layer memory network was used, since multi-hop induction was not needed."

This was achieved by identifying a set of 11 likely “foodie” cities and then collecting tip data associated with zipcodes near the city centers. While we targeted foodie cities, the dataset is very general and contains tips many types of local businesses (restaurants, theaters, museums, shopping, etc.) In the interests of manageability for experimental purposes, we ignored establishments associated with fewer than 10 tips, but other experiments with up to 50 tips per venue yield comparable results.

We refer to this as the 1M grounded dataset. Specifically, we identify conversation pairs in which the first turn contained either a handle of the business name (preceded by the “@” symbol) or a hashtag that\nmatched a handle.3 Because we are interested in conversations among real users (as opposed to customer service agents), we removed conversations where the response was generated by a user with a handle found in the Foursquare data."

      "text" : "We augment the 1M grounded dataset with facts (here Foursquare tips) relevant to each conversation history. The number of contextually relevant tips for some handles can sometimes be enormous, up to 10k. To filter them based on relevance to the input, the system uses tf-idf similarity between the input sentence and all of these tips and retains 10 tips with the highest score.\nFurthermore, for a significant portion of the 1M Twitter conversations collected using handles found on Foursquare, the last turn was not particularly informative, e.g., when it provides a purely socializing response (e.g., “have fun there”) rather than a contentful one. As one of our goals is to evaluate conversational systems on their ability to produce contentful responses, we select a dev and test set (4k conversations in total) designed to contain responses that are informative and useful.\nFor each handle in our dataset we created two scoring functions:\n• Perplexity according to a 1-gram LM trained on all the tips containing that handle. • χ-square score, which measures how much\ncontent each token bears in relation to the handle. Each tweet is then scored on the basis of the average content score of its terms.\nIn this manner, we selected 15k top-ranked conversations using the LM score and 15k using the chi-square score. A further 15k conversations were randomly sampled. We then randomly sampled 10k conversations these data to be evaluated by crowdsourced annotators. Human judges were presented with the conversations and asked to determine whether the response contained actionable information, i.e., did they contain information that would permit the respondents to decide, e.g., whether or not they should patronize an establishment. From this, we selected the top-ranked 4k conversations to be held out validation set and test set; these were removed from our training data.\n3This mechanism of linking conversations to facts using exact match on the handle is high precision but low recall, but low recall seems reasonable as we are far from exhausting all available Twitter and Foursquare data."

Then, the different variants of our multi-task learned system exploits these tasks as follows:\n• SEQ2SEQ: This system is trained on task NOFACTS with the 23M general conversation dataset. Since there is only one task, it is not per se a multi-task setting. • MTASK: This system is trained on two\ninstances of the NOFACTS task, respectively with the 23M general dataset and 1M grounded dataset (but without the facts).

The top 50k frequent types from conversation data is used as vocabulary which is shared between both conversation and non-conversation data. We use the same learning technique as (Luong et al., 2015) for multi-task learning. In each batch, all training data is sampled from one task only.

The third feature is added to deal with the issue of generating commonplace and generic responses such as “I don’t know”, which is discussed in details in (Li et al., 2016a). Our models often do not need the third feature to be effective, but—since our baseline needs it to avoid commonplace responses—we include this feature in all systems. This yields the following reranking score:\nlogP (R|S, F ) + λ logP (S|R) + γ|R| λ and γ are free parameters, which we tune on our development N -best lists using MERT (Och, 2003) by optimizing BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002a).

We observe that the perplexity of MTASK and MTASK-R models on both general and grounded data is as low as the SEQ2SEQ models that are trained specifically on general and grounded data respectively. As expected, injecting more factual content into the response in MTASKF and MTASK-RF increased the perplexity especially on grounded data.\nBLEU scores are low, but this is not untypical of conversational systems (e.g., (Li et al., 2016a,b)). Table 2 shows that the MTASK-R model yields a significant performance boost, with a BLEU score increase of 96% and 71% jump in 1-gram diversity compared to the competitive SEQ2SEQ baseline. In terms of BLEU scores, MTASK-RF improvements is not significant, but it generates the highest\nchine Translation (Graham et al., 2015), as BLEU and related metrics were originally designed as corpus-level metrics.\n1-gram and 2-gram diversity among all models.\nHuman Evaluation: We conducted human evaluations using a crowdsourcing service. We had annotators judge 500 paired conversations, asking which is better on two parameters: appropriateness to the topic, and informativeness. Seven judges were assigned to each pair. Annotators whose variance fell greater than two standard deviations from the mean variance were dropped. Ties were permitted.\nThe results of annotation are show in Table 3. On Appropriateness, no system performed significantly better than baseline, and in two cases, MTASK and MTASK-F, the baseline system was significantly better. MTASK-R appears to be slightly better than baseline in the table, but the difference is small and not statistically significant by conventional standards of α = 0.05. On Informativeness, MTASK-F and MTASK-R perform significantly better than Baseline (p = 0.005 and p = 0.003 respectively). Since the baseline system outperforms MTASK-F with respect to Appropriateness, this may mean that MTASK-F encounters difficulty representing the social dimensions of conversation, but is strong on informational content. MTASK-R, on the other hand, appears to hold its own on Appropriateness while improving with respect to Informativeness.\nThe narrow differences in averages in Table 3 tend to obfuscate the judges’ voting trends. Accordingly, we translated the scores for each output into the ratio of judges who preferred that system and binned their counts. The results are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 where we compare MTASK-R with the SEQ2SEQ baseline. Bin 7 on the left corresponds to the case where all 7 judges “voted” for the system, bin 6 to that where 6 out of 7 judges “voted” for the system, and so on.6 Other bins are not shown since these are a mirror image of bins 7 through 4. The distributions in Fig. 4 are more similar to each other than in Fig. 5. indicating that judge preference for the MTASK-R model is relatively stronger with regard to informativeness."

It illustrates that responses of our model are generally not only generally adequate, but also more informative and useful.\n6Partial scores were rounded up. This affects both systems equally.\nFor example the first response combines “have a safe flight”, which is safe and appropriate and as such typical of existing neural conversational systems, but also “nice airport terminal”, which is grounded in knowledge about the specific airport. While our model sometimes regurgitates fragments of tips in its responses, it often blends together information from various tips and the conversational in order to produce a response, such as in the the 5th and last responses of the figure. The 5th is mainly influenced by two Foursquare tips7 and the model creates a fusion of the two, a kind of text manipulation that would be difficult with slot filling."

The introduction of contextual models by (Sordoni et al., 2015) is an important advance; we build on this by incorporating context from outside the conversation.\nThis work distinguishes itself from a second paradigm of neural dialog modeling in which question answer slots are explicitly learned from small amounts of crowd-sourced data or customer support logs (Wen et al., 2015, 2016). In many respects, this second paradigm can be characterized as an extension of conventional dialog models with or without statistical modelling, e.g., (Oh and Rudnicky, 2000; Ratnaparkhi, 2002; Banchs and Li, 2012; Ameixa et al., 2014; Nio et al., 2014).\nRelevant to the current work is (Bordes and Weston, 2016), who employ memory networks to handle restaurant reservations, using a small number of keywords to handle entity types in a knowledge base (cuisine type, location, price range, party size, rating, phone number and address). That approach requires a highly structured knowledge base, whereas we are attempting to leverage free-form text using a highly scalable approach in order to learning implicit slots."

Nevertheless, these models have yet to demonstrate that they can incorporate content in the form of factual information or entity-grounded opinion that would enable them to serve in more task-oriented conversational applications. This paper presents a novel, fully data-driven, and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses without slot filling. We generalize the widely-used SEQ2SEQ approach by conditioning responses on both conversation history and external “facts”, allowing the model to be versatile and applicable in an open-domain setting. Our approach yields significant improvements over a competitive SEQ2SEQ baseline. Human judges found that our outputs are significantly more informative.",
