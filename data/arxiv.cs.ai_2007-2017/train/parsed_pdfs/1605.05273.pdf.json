Given a collection of graphs, learn a function that can be used for classification and regression problems on unseen graphs. The nodes and edges of any two graphs are not necessarily in correspondence. For instance, each graph of the collection could model a chemical compound and the output could be a function mapping unseen compounds to their level of activity against cancer cells.\n2. Given a large graph, learn graph representations that can be used to infer unseen graph properties such as node types and missing edges.\nWe propose a framework for learning representations for classes of directed and undirected graphs.

The field is moved over an image from left to right and top to bottom using a particular stride (here: 1) and zero-padding (here: none) (a). The values read by the receptive fields are transformed into a linear layer and fed to a convolutional architecture (b). The node sequence for which the receptive fields are created and the shapes of the receptive fields are fully determined by the hyper-parameters.\nhave nodes and edges with multiple discrete and continuous attributes and may have multiple types of edges. Similar to convolutional neural network for images, we construct locally connected neighborhoods from the input graphs. These neighborhoods are generated efficiently and serve as the receptive fields of a convolutional architecture, allowing the framework to learn effective graph representations.\nThe proposed approach builds on concepts from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Fukushima, 1980; Atlas et al., 1988; LeCun et al., 1998; 2015) for images and extends them to arbitrary graphs. Figure 1 illustrates the locally connected receptive fields of a CNN for images. An image can be represented as a square grid graph whose nodes represent pixels. Now, a CNN can be seen as traversing a node sequence (nodes 1-4 in Figure 1(a)) and generating fixed-size neighborhood graphs (the 3x3 grids in Figure 1(b)) for each of the nodes. The neighborhood graphs serve as the receptive fields to read feature values from the pixel nodes. Due to the implicit spatial order of the pixels, the sequence of nodes for which neighborhood graphs are created, from left to right and top to bottom, is uniquely determined. The same holds for NLP problems where each sentence (and its parse-tree) determines ar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n05 27\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n7 M\nay 2\n01 6\na sequence of words. However, for numerous graph collections a problem-specific ordering (spatial, temporal, or otherwise) is missing and the nodes of the graphs are not in correspondence. In these instances, one has to solve two problems: (i) Determining the node sequences for which neighborhood graphs are created and (ii) computing a normalization of neighborhood graphs, that is, a unique mapping from a graph representation into a vector space representation. The proposed approach, termed PATCHY-SAN, addresses these two problems for arbitrary graphs. For each input graph, it first determines nodes (and their order) for which neighborhood graphs are created. For each of these nodes, a neighborhood consisting of exactly k nodes is extracted and normalized, that is, it is uniquely mapped to a space with a fixed linear order. The normalized neighborhood serves as the receptive field for a node under consideration. Finally, feature learning components such as convolutional and dense layers are combined with the normalized neighborhood graphs as the CNN’s receptive fields.\nFigure 2 illustrates the PATCHY-SAN architecture which has several advantages over existing approaches: First, it is highly efficient, naively parallelizable, and applicable to large graphs. Second, for a number of applications, ranging from computational biology to social network analysis, it is important to visualize learned network motifs (Milo et al., 2002). PATCHY-SAN supports feature visualizations providing insights into the structural properties of graphs. Third, instead of crafting yet another graph kernel, PATCHY-SAN learns application dependent features without the need to feature engineering. Our theoretical contributions are the definition of the normalization problem on graphs and its complexity; a method for comparing graph labeling approaches for a collection of graphs; and a result that shows that PATCHY-SAN generalizes CNNs on images. Using standard benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that the learned CNNs for graphs are both efficient and effective compared to state of the art graph kernels."

      "text" : "Graph kernels allow kernel-based learning approaches such as SVMs to work directly on graphs (Vishwanathan et al., 2010). Kernels on graphs were originally defined as similarity functions on the nodes of a single graph (Kondor & Lafferty, 2002). Two representative classes of kernels are the skew spectrum kernel (Kondor & Borgwardt, 2008) and kernels based on graphlets (Kondor et al., 2009; Shervashidze et al., 2009). The latter is related to our work, as it builds kernels based on fixed-sized subgraphs. These subgraphs, which are often called motifs or graphlets, reflect functional network properties (Milo et al., 2002; Alon, 2007). However, due to the combinatorial complexity of subgraph enumeration, graphlet kernels are restricted to\nsubgraphs with few nodes. An effective class of graph kernels are the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernels (Shervashidze et al., 2011). WL kernels, however, only support discrete features and use memory linear in the number of training examples at test time. PATCHY-SAN uses WL as one possible labeling procedure to compute receptive fields. Deep graph kernels (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015) and graph invariant kernels (Orsini et al., 2015) compare graphs based on the existence or count of small substructures such as shortest paths (Borgwardt & Kriegel, 2005), graphlets, subtrees, and other graph invariants (Haussler, 1999; Orsini et al., 2015). In contrast, PATCHY-SAN learns substructures from graph data and is not limited to a predefined set of motifs. Moreover, while all graph kernels have a training complexity at least quadratic in the number of graphs (Shervashidze et al., 2011), which is prohibitive for large-scale problems, PATCHY-SAN scales linearly with the number of graphs.\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) (Scarselli et al., 2009) are a recurrent neural network architecture defined on graphs. GNNs apply recurrent neural networks for walks on the graph structure, propagating node representations until a fixed point is reached. The resulting node representations are then used as features in classification and regression problems. GNNs support only discrete labels and perform as many backpropagation operations as there are edges and nodes in the graph per learning iteration. Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks modify GNNs to use gated recurrent units and to output sequences (Li et al., 2015).\nRecent work extended CNNs to topologies that differ from the low-dimensional grid structure (Bruna et al., 2014; Henaff et al., 2015). All of these methods, however, assume one global graph structure, that is, a correspondence of the vertices across input examples. (Duvenaud et al., 2015) perform convolutional type operations on graphs, developing a differentiable variant of one specific graph feature."

CNNs were developed in the 1980s and have been applied to image, speech, text, and drug discovery problems (Atlas et al., 1988; LeCun et al., 1989; 1998; 2015; Wallach et al., 2015). A predecessor to CNNs was the Neocognitron (Fukushima, 1980). A typical CNN is composed of convolutional and dense layers. The purpose of the first convolutional layer is the extraction of common patterns found within local regions of the input images. CNNs convolve learned filters over the input image, computing the inner product at every image location in the image and outputting the result as tensors whose depth is the number of filters."

An undirected graph is a graph in which edges have no direction. Each graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix A of size n × n, where Ai,j = 1 if there is an edge from vertex vi to vertex vj , and Ai,j = 0 otherwise. In this case, we say that vertex vi has position i in A. Moreover, if Ai,j = 1 we say vi and vj are adjacent. Node and edge attributes are features that attain one value for each node and edge of a graph. We use the term attribute value instead of label to avoid confusion with the graph-theoretical concept of a labeling. A walk is a sequence of nodes in a graph, in which consecutive nodes are connected by an edge. A path is a walk with distinct nodes. We write d(u, v) to denote the distance between u and v, that is, the length of the shortest path between u and v. N1(v) is the 1-neighborhood of a node, that is, all nodes that are adjacent to v.\nLabeling and Node Partitions. PATCHY-SAN utilizes graph labelings to impose an order on nodes. A graph labeling ` is a function ` : V → S from the set of vertices V to an ordered set S such as the real numbers and integers. A graph labeling procedure computes a graph labeling for an input graph. When it is clear from the context, we use labeling to refer to both, the graph labeling and the procedure to compute it. A ranking (or coloring) is a function r : V → {1, ..., |V |}. Every labeling induces a ranking r with r(u) < r(v) if and only if `(u) > `(v).

Moreover, every graph labeling induces a partition {V1, ..., Vn} on V with u, v ∈ Vi if and only if `(u) = `(v).\nExamples of graph labeling procedures are node degree and other measures of centrality commonly used in the analysis of networks. For instance, the betweeness centrality of a vertex v computes the fractions of shortest paths that pass through v. The Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm (Weisfeiler & Lehman, 1968) is a procedure for partitioning the vertices of a graph. It is also known as color refinement and naive vertex classification. Color refinement has attracted considerable interest in the ML community as it can be applied to speed-up inference in graphical models (Kersting et al., 2009; 2014) and as a method to compute graph kernels (Shervashidze et al., 2011). PATCHY-SAN applies these labeling procedures, among others (degree, page-rank, eigenvector centrality, etc.), to impose an order on the nodes of graphs, replacing application-dependent orders (temporal, spatial, etc.) where missing.\nIsomorphism and Canonicalization. The computational problem of deciding whether two graphs are isomorphic surfaces in several application domains. The graph isomorphism (GI) problem is in NP but not known to be in P or NP-hard. Under several mild restrictions, GI is known to be in P. For instance, GI is in P for graphs of bounded degree (Luks, 1982). A canonicalization of a graph G is a graph G′ with a fixed vertex order which is isomorphic to G and which represents its entire isomorphism class. In practice, the graph canonicalization tool NAUTY has shown remarkable performance (McKay & Piperno, 2014)."

      "text" : "When CNNs are applied to images, a receptive field (a square grid) is moved over each image with a particular step size. The receptive field reads the pixels’ feature values, once for each channel, and a patch of values is created for each channel. Since the pixels of an image have an implicit arrangement – a spatial order – the receptive fields are always moved from left to right and top to bottom. Moreover, the spatial order uniquely determines the nodes of each receptive field and the way its nodes are mapped to a vector space representation (see Figure 1(b)). Consequently, the values read from two pixels using two different locations of the receptive field are assigned to the same relative position if and only if the pixels’ structural roles (their spatial position within the receptive field) are identical.\nTo show the connection between CNNs and PATCHY-SAN, we frame CNNs on images as identifying a sequence of nodes in the square grid graph representing the image and building a normalized neighborhood graph – a receptive field – for each node in the identified sequence. For graph collections where an application-dependent node order is missing and where the nodes of any two graphs are not yet aligned, we need to determine for each graph (i) the sequences of nodes for which we create neighborhoods, and (ii) a unique mapping from the graph representation to a vector representation such that nodes with similar structural roles in the neighborhood graphs are positioned similarly in the vector representation.\nWe address these problems by leveraging graph labeling procedures that assigns nodes of two different graphs to a similar relative position in their respective adjacency matrices if their structural roles within the graphs are similar. Given a collection of graphs, PATCHY-SAN (SELECTASSEMBLE-NORMALIZE) applies the following steps to each graph: (1) Select a fixed-length sequence of nodes from the graph; (2) assemble a fixed-size neighborhood for each node in the selected sequence; (3) normalize the extracted neighborhood graph; and (4) learn neighborhood representations with convolutional neural networks from the resulting sequence of patches.\nAlgorithm 3 NORMALIZEGRAPH: Graph Normalization 1: input: subset of vertices U from original graph G, vertex v,\ngraph labeling `, receptive field size k 2: output: receptive field for v 3: compute ranking r of U using `, subject to ∀u,w ∈ U : d(u, v) < d(w, v)⇒ r(u) < r(w) 4: if |U | > k then 5: N = top k vertices in U according to r 6: compute ranking r of N using `, subject to ∀u,w ∈ N : d(u, v) < d(w, v)⇒ r(u) < r(w) 7: else if |V | < k then 8: N = U and k − |U | dummy nodes 9: else\n10: N = U 11: construct the subgraph G[N ] for the vertices N 12: canonicalize G[N ], respecting the prior coloring r 13: return G[N ]\nIn the following, we describe methods that address the above-mentioned challenges."

Second, the resulting node sequence is traversed using a given stride s and for each visited node, Algorithm 4 is executed to construct a receptive field, until exactlyw receptive fields have been created. The stride s determines the distance, relative to the selected node sequence, between two consecutive nodes for which a receptive field is created.

For instance, a depth-first traversal of the input graph guided by the values of the graph labeling.

      "heading" : "4.3. Graph Normalization",
      "text" : "The receptive field for a node is constructed by normalizing the neighborhood assembled in the previous step. Illustrated in Figure 3, the normalization imposes an order on the nodes of the neighborhood graph so as to map from the unordered graph space to a vector space with a linear order. The basic idea is to leverage graph labeling procedures that assigns nodes of two different graphs to a similar relative position in the respective adjacency matrices if and only if their structural roles within the graphs are similar.\nTo formalize this intuition, we define the optimal graph normalization problem which aims to find a labeling that is optimal relative to a given collection of graphs.\nProblem 1 (Optimal graph normalization). Let G be a collection of unlabeled graphs with k nodes, let ` be an injective graph labeling procedure, let dG be a distance measure on graphs with k nodes, and let dA be a distance measure on k × k matrices. Find ˆ̀such that\nˆ̀= argmin `\nEG [∣∣dA (A`(G),A`(G′))− dG(G,G′)∣∣] .\nThis problem amounts to finding a graph labeling procedure `, such that, for any two graphs drawn uniformly at random from G, the expected difference between the distance of the graphs in vector space (with respect to the adjacency matrices based on `) and the distance of the graphs in graph space is minimized. The optimal graph normalization problem is a generalization of the classical graph\ncanonicalization problem. A canonical labeling algorithm, however, is optimal only for isomorphic graphs and might perform poorly for graphs that are similar but not isomorphic. In contrast, the smaller the expectation of the optimal normalization problem, the better the labeling aligns nodes with similar structural roles. Note that the similarity is determined by dG.\nWe have the following result concerning the complexity of the optimal normalization problem.\nTheorem 1. Optimal graph normalization is NP-hard.\nProof: By reduction from subgraph isomorphism.\nPATCHY-SAN does not solve the above optimization problem. Instead, it may compare different graph labeling methods and choose the one that performs best relative to a given collection of graphs.\nTheorem 2. Let G be a collection of graphs and let (G1, G ′ 1), ..., (GN , G ′ N ) be a sequence of pairs of graphs sampled independently and uniformly at random from G. Let θ̂` := ∑N i=1 dA ( A`(Gi),A `(G′i) ) /N and θ` :=\nEG [∣∣dA (A`(G),A`(G′))− dG(G,G′)∣∣]. If dA ≥ dG, then EG [θ̂`1 ] < EG [θ̂`2 ] if and only if θ`1 < θ`2 .\nTheorem 2 enables us to compare different labeling procedures in an unsupervised manner via a comparison of the corresponding estimators. Under the assumption dA ≥ dG, the smaller the estimate θ̂` the smaller the absolute difference. Therefore, we can simply choose the labeling ` for which θ̂` is minimal. The assumption dA ≥ dG holds, for instance, for the edit distance on graphs and the Hamming distance on adjacency matrices. Finally, note that all of the above results can be extended to directed graphs.\nThe graph normalization problem and the application of appropriate graph labeling procedures for the normalization of local graph structures is at the core of the proposed approach. Within the PATCHY-SAN framework, we normalize the neighborhood graphs of a vertex v. The labeling of the vertices is therefore constrained by the graph distance to v: for any two vertices u,w, if u is closer to v thanw, then v is always ranked higher than w. This definition ensures that v has always rank 1, and that the closer a vertex is to v in G, the higher it is ranked in the vector space representation.\nSince most labeling methods are not injective, it is necessary to break ties between same-label nodes. To do so, we use NAUTY (McKay & Piperno, 2014). NAUTY accepts prior node partitions as input and breaks remaining ties by choosing the lexicographically maximal adjacency matrix. It is known that graph isomorphism is in PTIME for graphs of bounded degree (Luks, 1982). Due to the constant size k of the neighborhood graphs, the algorithm runs in time polynomial in the size of the original graph and, on average, in time linear in k (Babai et al., 1980). The experiments we\nconducted verify that computing a canonical labeling of the graph neigborhoods adds a negligible overhead.\nAlgorithm 3 lists the normalization procedure. If the size of the input set U is larger than k, it first applies the ranking based on ` to select the top k nodes and computes the ranking again on the smaller set of nodes. If the size of U is smaller than k, it adds disconnected dummy nodes. Finally, it induces the subgraph on the verticesN and canonicalizes the graph taking the ranking r as prior coloring.\nWe can relate PATCHY-SAN to CNNs for images as follows. Theorem 3. Given a sequence of pixels taken from an image. Applying PATCHY-SAN with receptive field size (2m − 1)2, stride s, no zero padding, and 1-WL normalization to the sequence is identical (up to a fixed permutation of the receptive field) to the first layer of a CNN with receptive field size 2m− 1, stride s, and no zero padding.\nProof: It is possible to show that if an input graph is a square grid, then the 1-WL normalized receptive field constructed for a vertex is always a square grid graph with a unique vertex order."

This can be reshaped to the 2-dimensional (wk, av) and a (wk2, ae) tensors, respectively. Note that av and ae are the number of input channels.

Dropout and the relatively small number of neurons are needed to avoid overfitting on the smaller data sets. The only hyperparameter we optimized is the number of epochs and the batch size for the mini-batch gradient decent algorithm RMSPROP. All of the above was implemented with the THEANO (Bergstra et al., 2010) wrapper KERAS (Chollet, 2015). We also applied a logistic regression (PSLR) classifier on the patches for k = 10.\nMoreover, we ran experiments with the same set-up2 on larger social graph data sets (up to 12000 graphs each, with an average of 400 nodes), and compared PATCHY-SAN with previously reported results for the graphlet count (GK) and the deep graphlet count kernel (DGK) (Yanardag & Vishwanathan, 2015). We used the normalized node degree as attribute for PATCHY-SAN, featuring one of its advantages: it can easily incorporate continuous features.\nResults. Table 1 lists the results of the experiments. We omit the results for NCI109 as they are almost identical to NCI1. Despite using a one-fits-all CN architecture, the CNs accuracy is highly competitive with existing graph kernels. A receptive field size of 10 leads usually to a better classification accuracy. The relatively high variance can be explained with the data set’s small size and the fact that the\n2Due to the larger size of the data sets, we removed dropout.\nCNs hyperparameters (with the exception of epochs and batch size) were not tuned to individual data sets. Similar to the experience on image and text data, we expect PATCHYSAN to perform even better for large data sets. Moreover, PATCHY-SAN is between 2 and 8 times more efficient than the most efficient graph kernel (WL). We expect the performance advantage to be much more pronounced for data sets with a large number of graphs. Results for betweeness centrality normalization are similar with the exception of the runtime which increases by about 10%. Logistic regression applied to PATCHY-SAN’s receptive fields performs worse, indicating that PATCHY-SAN works especially well in conjunction with CNNs which learn non-linear feature combinations and which share weights across receptive fields.\nPATCHY-SAN is also highly competitive on the social graph data. It significantly outperforms the other two kernels on four of the six data sets and achieves ties on the rest. Table 2 lists the results of the experiments."

      "text" : "We proposed a framework for learning graph representations that are especially beneficial in conjunction with CNNs. It combines two complementary procedures: (a) selecting a sequence of nodes that covers large parts of the graph and (b) generating local normalized neigbrohood representations for each of the nodes in the sequence. Experiments show that the approach is competitive with state of the art graph kernels.\nDirections for future work include the use of alternative neural network architectures such as RNNs; combining different receptive field sizes; pretraining with RBMs and autoencoders; and statistical relational models based on the ideas of the approach."

These graphs may be undirected, directed, and with both discrete and continuous node and edge attributes. Analogous to image-based convolutional networks that operate on locally connected regions of the input, we present a general approach to extracting locally connected regions from graphs. Using established benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that the learned feature representations are competitive with state of the art graph kernels and that their computation is highly efficient.",
