      "text" : "Named-entity recognition (NER) is a foundational NLP task that is traditionally approached as a supervised learning problem. In this setting, state-of-theart NER systems often require considerable manual feature engineering to learn robust models using hand-labeled training data. Recent success in deep learning for NER (Lample et al., 2016) suggests that automatic feature extraction will largely replace this process. However, this shifts the burden to constructing the massive hand-labeled training sets needed for robust deep models.\nHow do we obtain enough training data to fit these complex models? Crowdsourcing offers one way of generating large-scale labeled data, but the process is expensive, especially when annotators require specialized domain knowledge or data has\nprivacy concerns preventing distribution (Sabou et al., 2012; Gokhale et al., 2014). Furthermore, even expert inter-annotator agreement rates can be low for certain tasks.\nIn NLP, another common approach is distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) where structured resources like ontologies and knowledge bases are used to heuristically label training data. While noisy, this technique has shown empirical success. Distant supervision is commonly used with a few, canonical structured resources like Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), weighting each resource equally when labeling data. However, in biomedicine we are faced with a wide space of curated resources; NCBO Bioportal (Whetzel et al., 2011) currently houses 541 distinct biomedical ontologies. These resources contain different hierarchical structures, concept granularities, and otherwise overlap or conflict in their definitions of 8 million entities. Any single ontology may have widely varying accuracy depending on the target task, making them difficult to combine using simple methods like majority vote.\nWe present SWELLSHARK, a framework for quickly building biomedical NER taggers using lexicons, heuristics, and other forms of weak supervision instead of hand-labeled data. Our approach effectively subsumes both crowdsourcing and distant supervision, automatically modeling all such inputs as a generative labeling process. This functional view allows us to take advantage of recent advances in denoising weak supervision, more effectively unifying large-scale biomedical resources.\nOur approach greatly simplifies supervision in an NER system. Traditional distant supervision pipelines consist of three basic components: (1) candidate generation, i.e., identifying potential entities for labeling and classification; (2) labeling heuristics for generating noisy labels; and (3) features describing candidates for classification. Pre-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n06 36\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 A\npr 2\n01 7\nviously, each of these has required human engineering or supervision. In SWELLSHARK we show that in the presence of structured resources like lexicons and ontologies, components (1) and (2) can be largely automated. When coupled with automatic feature extraction models like LSTMs, we create a powerful end-to-end pipeline that requires dramatically less human input and can train high-accuracy taggers using unlabeled data.\nThe central argument of this work is that modeling noise in supervision resources is such a powerful strategy that it enables tremendous performance gains from even simple NER techniques. This allows us to focus exclusively on the resources used to supervise a model instead of diffusing human effort across an entire extraction pipeline.\nOur three core contributions are summarized as: • Automatic Candidate Generation: SWELL-\nSHARK automatically generates potential or candidate entity mentions in documents, a heuristic process that traditionally required non-trivial engineering. Since candidates define the space over which we both provide supervision and learn, selecting the right approach is critical to overall performance. • Autogenerated Supervision: SWELL-\nSHARK only requires a set of positive and negative lexicons as baseline input. Several classes of automatic supervision generators apply transformations to these lexicons and efficiently generate a large space of noisy supervision with minimal human input. • Weakly-supervising Sequences: SWELL-\nSHARK allows us to “compile” supervision inputs, like lexicons and other heuristic rules, directly into a sequence prediction model. We propose a multinomial generative model to explicitly learn entity boundaries, a key part of NER, and model the accuracies of our underlying supervision sources.\nModeling noise while generating data is critical for scaling, where we improve tagger accuracy by using more unlabeled data to train our models. With SWELLSHARK, we construct weakly-labeled training sets of up to 100K documents, providing boosts of up to 6.7% (4.9 F1 points) over the same models trained on small ( ≤ 1K) document collections. With scaling, we can achieve competitive results to state-of-the-art supervised models.\nFinally, as an applied validation challenge, we used SWELLSHARK to build an NER system in\nanother biomedical domain: tagging drug names in clinical discharge summaries. We report the performance achieved by a single domain expert given 24 hours for development and model training. SWELLSHARK scored within 5.1% of a crowdsourced annotation approach, which originally utilized 20 teams over the course of several weeks."

      "text" : "Domain-specific NER tasks are a well-studied NLP problem. The best performing systems use supervised or semi-supervised learning and require handannotated training data. In biomedical NER, supervised methods using CRFs are the standard (Settles, 2004; Leaman et al., 2008) though RNNs/LSTMs are increasingly common (Sahu and Anand, 2016; Dernoncourt et al., 2016). Semi-supervised methods that augment labeled datasets with word embeddings (Tang et al., 2014; Kuksa and Qi, 2010) or bootstrapping techniques (Vlachos and Gasperin, 2006) have been shown to outperform supervised baselines in tasks like gene name recognition. Unlike these existing approaches, SWELLSHARK does not require hand-labeled training data and is agnostic to the choice of discriminative model.\nLeveraging existing resources to heuristically label data has received considerable research interest. Distant supervision (Craven et al., 1999; Mintz et al., 2009) uses knowledge bases to supervise relation extraction tasks. Recent methods incorporate more generalized knowledge into extraction systems. Natarajan et al.(2016) used Markov Logic Networks to encode commonsense domain knowledge like “home teams are more likely to win a game” and generate weak training examples. SWELLSHARK is informed by these methods, but uses a generative model to unify and model noise across different supervision sources."

      "text" : "Biomedical NER Identifying named entities is a core component of applied biomedical information extraction systems and a critical subtask in normalization, where entities are mapped to canonical identifiers, and relation extraction, where we identify n-arity semantic connections between entities. Ontologies are key artifacts in formalizing biological concepts for normalization and use in computational systems. Biomedical NER focuses on identifying these concepts. For example we would label a sentence as: “Primary pulmonary\nhypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease.” to identify a disease name.\nFor simplicity, in this work we assume each entity is a binary classification task, i.e., each tagger predicts one entity type, although our method generalizes to multi-class settings without extensive changes. We focus on the recognition part of named entity extraction and do not address normalization.\nData programming: Ratner et al. (2016) proposed data programming as a method for programmatic training set creation. In data programming, a collection of user-provided rules called labeling functions (LFs) are modeled as a generative process of training set labeling. Labeling functions may overlap and conflict in their labels, as long as the majority have accuracies greater than 50%. By default, it’s assumed that labeling functions are conditionally independent. Fitting a generative model allows us to automatically estimate these accuracies without ground truth data. The resulting model is then used to construct large-scale training sets with probabilistic labels.\nFormally, labeling functions are black box functions which label some subset of data. In our setting, given a set of candidates for a single entity class (e.g., disease names) and corresponding binary labels, (x, y) ∈ X ×{−1, 1}, where the y are unseen, a labeling function λi maps:\nλi : X 7→ {−1, 0, 1}\nwhere 0 means a labeling function abstains from providing a label. The output of a set of M labeling functions applied to N candidates is a matrix Λ ∈ {−1, 0, 1}N×M . Each labeling function is represented by a single accuracy parameter, learned based on observing the agreements and disagreements between overlapping labeling functions.\nInstead of binary ground-truth training labels (x, y) with y ∈ {−1, 1}, we now utilize the marginal probabilities of our generative model, Pµ(Y | Λ) ∈ [0, 1], as training labels for a discriminative model, such as logistic regression or an LSTM. This requires using a noise-aware version of our loss function. This can be implemented analytically in the discriminative model or simulated by creating a sampled dataset based on our marginal probabilities."

Details for each stage are described below."

This is typically a collection of lexicons, ontologies, and optional heuristic rules. Supervision largely consists of specifying positive and negative lexicons. As a toy example, a minimal drug tagger specification could be (1: antibotic, -1: amino acid, peptide, or protein, gene or genome), with each semantic category mapping to source lexicons in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Bodenreider, 2004) or other external dictionaries."

      "heading" : "4.2 Candidate Generators",
      "text" : "Our approach requires first identifying a set of potential or candidate mentions in documents. We define a candidate generator, Γφ, as a function that transforms a document collection D into a candidate set: Γφ : D 7→ {x1, ..., xN}. Each candidate x is defined as a character-level span within a document sentence. Candidate generators are heuristics that can be restrictive e.g., the set of all dictionary matches, or permissive, such as all overlapping kgram spans. The choice of heuristic impacts overall\nperformance, since candidates define the space over which we both provide supervision and learn. We explore the following simple automated generators: • Noun Phrases All noun phrases as matched\nusing regular expressions over POS tags. • Dictionary Domain dictionaries with no\ndomain-specific stopword lists or other lexical curation.\nEach heuristic emits k-grams candidates; in our experiments k = [1-10]. Choosing a heuristic involves some trade-off between development time and performance. Hand-tuned matchers require more engineering, but generate more accurate candidate sets. This requires less weak supervision to train the discriminative model, since the candidate generation step acts as an implicit hard filter. In contrast, dictionary and noun phrase candidates are generated automatically, but create additional challenges during learning. Dictionary matches limit recall, impacting generalizability; noun phrase candidates generate larger sets, introducing more noise during labeling function application."

      "heading" : "4.3 Labeling Function Generators",
      "text" : "Labeling functions are a generalization of strategies used in distant supervision. For example, in disease name tagging we can define a labeling function that outputs 1 if a candidate occurs in a disease or syndrome lexicon and another function which outputs -1 if it’s found in a gene or genome lexicon. Several examples are shown in Figure 2.\ndef LF_in_lexicon(c): t = c.text() return 1 if t in umls_disease else 0\ndef LF_idf_filter(c): return -1 if idf(c) <= 4.0 else 0\ndef LF_temporal_modifiers(c): head = c.tokens(\"words\")[0] return -1 if head in temp_mod else 0\nFigure 2: Example labeling functions : (top) tests for membership in a lexicon; (middle) filters by candidate inverse document frequency; and (bottom) defines a compositional grammar rule for rejecting candidates beginning with a temporal modifier, e.g., *recurrent* carcinoma, *childhood* cancer.\nLabeling functions using structured resources assume predictable froms, meaning most lexicalbased supervision can be autogenerated. We define a labeling function generator (LFG), Γλ, as a func-\ntion which accepts a weak supervision resource, R, e.g., an ontology or empirical attributes like term frequencies, and automatically generates one or more labeling functions, Γλ : R 7→ {λ1, ..., λN}. LFGs automate a large space of supervision from minimal manual input, such as a collection of positive and negative lexicons. We implemented LFGs as described in Table 1.\nA single generator can instantiate multiple positive and negative labeling functions. This occurs in the case of overlapping candidate spans, where we allow supervision to cascade to nested child entities. In Figure 3 some children of “primary pulmonary hypertension” are dictionary members and are assigned positive labels. However, if we wish to enforce longest match, we can define a dictionary generator that votes positive on the longest match and negative on all child nodes. Other complex primitives are possible using compositions, such as synonym or negation detection. Our goal is to make it easy and fast to use combinations of LFGs and LFs to provide supervision for a new tagger."

      "heading" : "4.4 Multinomial Generative Model",
      "text" : "A key challenge of our simple, unified framework for accepting weak supervision is that it involves overlapping candidates. The generative model originally proposed by data programming assumes candidates are independent, and does not account for dependencies induced by overlapping spans. Figure 3 shows how this can lead to incorrect marginal probability estimates. In this example, all variants of “hypertension” are found in a single lexi-\ncon, overestimating positive label probabilities for nested candidates. To address this bias, we extend the generative model to learn mutual exclusion constraints. For NER, this change is vital because it allows us to learn entity boundaries while maintaining simple labeling function semantics, i.e., voting on discrete candidates. In our experiments, modeling these dependencies improves overall F1 score by up-to 4.7% (3.4 points).\nWe define a spanset, s, as a collection of overlapping candidates within a sentence as partitioned by the labeling matrix Λ, where each candidate’s row contains the labels generated by all labeling function. Candidates with ≥ 1 positive, overlapping labels form the basis of each spanset. Candidates with ≥ 1 negative labels and 0 positives are added if such addition does not join two disconnected spansets. Unlabeled candidates are removed.\nEach spanset is represented as a matrix X̂ ∈ RM×K where M is the number of labeling functions and K is the number of overlapping candidates per spanset plus the NONE class. In our datasets, these matrices are column sparse with small K. Pathologically long cases are filtered out.\nPositive label semantics remain unchanged in this framing. However negative labels are now underspecified since they don’t provide enough supervision to perfectly map to a sequence prediction task. A candidate may be completely wrong (the NONE class) or a partial match. For example, in Figure 3 a negative vote for “primary” doesn’t tell us if the whole spanset is wrong or if it’s a subset of a correct entity (as is the case). Our convention is if the ith LF votes negatively on a candidate j, this is expressed as having uniform distribution over all K columns except j in row i of X̂ .\nLearning is otherwise unchanged from the binary case, except we now apply the softmax function to each spanset matrix X̂ to compute marginals.\nP (Y = j|X̂;w) = exp(w T X̂j)∑K\nk=1 exp(w T X̂k)"

      "text" : "As our experimental testbed, we built three biomedical taggers: two for disease names (“osteoarthritis”) and one for chemical names (“bupropion hydrochloride”), with each tagger trained using a CRF or LSTM. Each model configuration is evaluated using 25K to 100K unlabeled training documents.\nOur primary experimental questions are: 1) what are the performance trade-offs of different candidate generation heuristics; 2) how well does autogenerated supervision perform; and 3) how quickly can we write a tagger for use in other domains?\nComparison Systems: For our baseline comparison system, we use reported benchmarks from TaggerOne (Leaman and Lu, 2016) a state-of-theart general purpose biomedical NER tagger. Their approach uses a CRF with manually engineered features. We compute two simple baselines: a string matching score using all positive lexicons (LEX) and a domain-agnostic stop word list; and the majority vote (MV) across all labeling functions.\n1) Tuning Candidate Generation: We explored the trade-offs of two automated candidate generation methods compared to a manually-engineered\nbaseline. For each tagger, we implemented an optimized, hand-tuned generator using regular expressions, dictionaries, and other fuzzy matching heuristics. These generators are task-specific, carefully maximizing recall while minimizing false positives. We compute precision-recall curves for each heuristic and report F1 scores when those methods are scaled. We empirically evaluated precision/recall tradeoffs of different k-gram token lengths and use k=6 for all candidates. Here we use the CDR disease task as our motivating example.\n2) Autogenerating Supervision: We trained models using only autogenerated, lexicon-based labeling functions and NounPhrase candidate generators. Here supervision consists of specifying positive and negative semantic categories selected from the 133 semantic definitions provided by the UMLS. Lexicons provide a strong baseline supervision framework, but they are usually incapable of modeling the entire dataset generation process. The definition of ground truth often depends on dataset-specific annotation guidelines. For example, in our clinical notes task, mentions of drug names that are negated or describe patient allergies are not considered true mentions; a lexicon alone cannot encode this form of supervision. Choosing what affixes, modifiers, and prepositional phrases constitute an entity can vary greatly across datasets.\nOne advantage of SWELLSHARK is that this type of dataset-specific supervision is easily introduced into our system by adding more labeling functions. For each PubMed tagger, we extended our lexical supervision with labeling functions to capture annotation guidelines and other dataset-specific supervision. This required writing 20-50 additional labeling functions per task.\n3) Building a Tagger in 24-hours: We tested out ability to quickly build a high-performance tagger in another biomedical domain. Given a time budget of 24 hours, we used our tools to build a drug name tagger for clinical discharge summaries. For the autogenerated LF model, our positive supervision consisted of 13 chemical semantic types from the UMLS. This setup required about one hour. We spent the remaining time examining training data to identify syntactical patterns and rules for labeling functions. Due to time constraints and the lack of additional unlabeled data, we did not explore scale-up performance.\nLabeling Function Development: All labeling functions and domain stop word lists were developed iteratively by inspecting unlabeled training documents. Manually written LFs were refined based on empirical accuracy scores from a small set of held-out labeled training instances. No ground truth labels were used to fit our final discriminative models; we only use noise-aware labels produced by the generative model."

A NounPhrase generator scores within 2% of the handtuned heuristic with CRF/emb and 1.25% using\nLSTM-CRF/emb (see Table 2). The bump in performance seen around 1K documents is an artifact of scale-up using a CRF with embeddings, where there is some early overfitting.\nTables 2 contains scores for PubMed taggers, comparing manual and automated candidate generation heuristics at scale. In both CDR tasks, we can closely match or exceed benchmark scores reported by TaggerOne (from +0.5 to -0.1 F1 points). In chemicals, NounPhrase candidate generation demonstrates better recall and improves on handtuned matchers by 0.7 points. In contrast, the NCBI task performs far below baseline using NounPhrase generators. This is due to that dataset’s more complex definition of mentions, including conjunctions (“breast and ovarian cancer”) and prepositional phrases (“deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase A”). These increase partial matches, hurting overall performance. With a hand-tuned candidate generator, we can account for these specific cases and dramatically improve performance and scoring -0.7 F1 points within the benchmark."

Pretrained word embeddings give the LSTM-CRF an advantage in smaller document settings, converging quickly to the best score after 10K additional unlabeled documents. In contrast, without embeddings, the LSTM-CRF is always dominated by CRF models, requiring over 3x more unlabeled data to learn features that approach the same score.

We then use a generative model to unify and denoise this supervision and construct large-scale, probabilistically labeled datasets for training high-accuracy NER taggers. In three biomedical NER tasks, SWELLSHARK achieves competitive scores with state-of-the-art supervised benchmarks using no hand-labeled training data. In a drug name extraction task using patient medical records, one domain expert using SWELLSHARK achieved within 5.1% of a crowdsourced annotation approach – which originally utilized 20 teams over the course of several weeks – in 24 hours.",
