      "text" : "In recent years, many AI challenges or competitions have been proposed to help evaluate the cognitive levels of machines (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011; Weston et al. 2015; Clark 2015). Among those challenges, the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) has been proposed as an alternative to the Turing Test (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011). Turing first introduced the notion of testing a computer system’s intelligence by assessing whether it could make a human judge think that she was conversing with a human rather a computer (Turing 1950). However, some recent efforts have merely on engaged surface-level conversation tricks to fool humans who do not delve deeply enough into a conversation, and make them think they are speaking to another human being (Veselov, Demchenko, and Ulasen ; Warwick and Shah 2014). To fix this issue, WSC is claimed to be a more suitable task which does not rely on human’s\nCopyright c© 2017\nsubjective assessment. A Winograd schema (WS) question is a pair of sentences that differ only in one or two words which results in a different resolution of coreference. A wellknown example is “The city council refused the demonstrators a permit because they feared violence,” where “they” refers to the council. But if one changes the verb “feared” to “advocated”, the computer needs to know that “they” refers to “demonstrator”, if it possesses real intelligence. To solve the problem, common sense knowledge is essential. Towards solving the final solution for WS problem, a similar test set, called pronoun disambiguation problem (PDP) is designed as the first round of the Winograd Schema Challenge (Morgenstern, Davis, and Ortiz Jr 2016). A typical example is “Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own.” One way to reason that she in she dressed refers to Mrs. March and not the mother, is to realize that the phrase “as if it were her own” implies that it (the baby) is not actually her own; that is, she is not the mother and must, by process of elimination, be Mrs. March. Similar to the Winograd schemas, a substantial amount of commonsense knowledge appears to be necessary to disambiguate pronouns.\nThis paper proposes neural network models to combine context and commonsense knowledge to solve both the WS and PDP problem. The main ideas are two-fold: 1) The first is to leverage context effectively. We believe that since context is a key information for learning word meanings, it should be useful for disambiguating the Winograd schema problems. In general, modeling context and learning word meanings could be very efficient through unsupervised learning that leverages large amounts of free texts. 2) In the common sense respect, we describe a simple but effective method utilizing commonsense knowledge. To jointly consider those two aspects, this paper proposes to combine context and commonsense knowledge through neural networks through a knowledge enhanced embeddings (KEE) framework. This paper further proposes two methods: 1) The first is the an unsupervised semantic similarity method (USSM), which represents all the pronouns and candidate mentions by composing their contexts based on the pre-trained knowledge enhanced embeddings. We then calculate the semantic similarities between the embedding vectors of the pronoun under concern and all candidate mentions. The candidate with largest semantic similarity with respect to the ar X iv :1 61 1.\n04 14\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 3\nN ov\n2 01\n6\npronoun will be predicted as the answer. 2) The second method is a neural knowledge activated method (NKAM), which extracts features based on the KEE models and trains a mention pair classifier with neural networks. For the experiment section, this paper conducts experiments on the official datasets of the first WSC challenge, including the PDP test set provided by commonsensereasoning.org, as well as a set of Winograd schemas manually created by (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011). Experimental results all indicate that the proposed KEE method (combing context and knowledge) performs better comparing with the baseline models.\nThe remainder of the paper will start with introducing the main motivation. After that, we introduce the main methods proposed to solve the WS and PDP problems. We then present all the experiments, including setup, datasets, and results, before we conclude this work."

      "text" : "The Winograd schema (WS) evaluates a system’s commonsense reasoning ability based on a traditional, very specific natural language processing task: coreference resolution (Saba 2015). The WS problems are carefully designed to be a task that cannot be easily solved without commonsense knowledge. In fact, even the solution of traditional coreference resolution problems rely on semantics or world knowledge (Strube 2016). As described in (Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern 2011), a WS is a small reading comprehension test involving a single binary question.\n• Joan made sure to thank Susan for all the help she had given. Who had given the help?\n– Answer A: Joan – Answer B: Susan – Correct Answer: B\nThe correct answers to the above question are obvious for human beings. In each of the questions, the corresponding WS has the following four features:\n1. Two parties are mentioned in a sentence by noun phrases. They can be two males, two females, two inanimate objects or two groups of people or objects.\n2. A pronoun or possessive adjective is used in the sentence in reference to one of the parties, but is also of the right sort for the second party.\n3. The question involves determining the referent of the pronoun or possessive adjective. Answer A is always the first party mentioned in the sentence (but repeated from the sentence for clarity), and Answer B is the second party.\n4. There is a word (called the special word) that appears in the sentence and possibly the question. When it is replaced by another word (called the alternate word), everything still makes perfect sense, but the answer changes.\nIn this example, if we change the word given to received, the answer changes to A (i.e., Joan) since in our commonsense knowledge, we think that a person who receives help should makes sure to thank the person who provides help to him."

      "text" : "The pronoun disambiguation problems (PDP) are complex coreference resolution problems, which are taken directly or modified from examples found in literature, biographies, autobiographies, essays, news analyses, and news stories; they may need some manual processing (Morgenstern, Davis, and Ortiz Jr 2016). Here is one typical PDP example: • The Dakota prairie lay so warm and bright under the\nshining sun that it did not seem possible that it had ever been swept by the winds and snows of that hard winter. – Snippet: it had ever been swept – Answer A: the prairie – Answer B: the sun – Correct Answer: A\nIn the PDP problem, the pronoun to be resolved is highlighted in bold. It is repeated again, with a snippet of context, and with several candidate answers, in the line following the passage. In the example shown here, we know that the prairie (rather than the sun) would be more likely to be swept by the winds. A difference between PDP and WS problems is that, the number of candidate noun phrases in each PDP problem would not always be two, but can be three, four, or even more. Therefore, the random-guess accuracy in the PDP problems will be less than 50% while the accuracy of a random-guess for WS is 50%."

      "text" : "Solving WS or PDP problems is not easy since it requires commonsense knowledge. In the paper, we propose to combine context and commonsense knowledge through neural networks for solving both problems. The main motivation is described as follows. First, since context is key for learning word meaning (Harris 1954; Miller and Charles 1991), we represent the pronoun and all the candidate mentions by their contexts. For instance, in the aforementioned PDP example, we represent the word prairie by The Dakota and lay so warm and bright. Meanwhile, the word sun could be represented by and bright under the shining and that it did not seem. Based on this, the pronoun disambiguation problems is solved by calculating the semantic similarities between the representations of the pronoun and all the corresponding candidates. Second, relying only on context is not good enough for tackling the WS and PDP problems. It is essential to find an effective strategy to combine context and commonsense knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a knowledge enhanced embedding (KEE) model. As shown in Figure 1, the KEE model combines the context and commonsense knowledge, in the feature level.

In the semantic similarity method, we represent all the pronouns and candidate mentions by composing their contexts from words. By further calculating the semantic similarities between the representations of each pronoun and the corresponding candidate mentions, the procedure to answer PDP or WS questions could then be implemented by finding the most similar candidate for the pronoun. In the neural network methods, the pre-trained KEE models are also used for extracting embedding features for all the pronouns and candidates. However, we do not calculate the semantic similarities. On the contrary, we train a typical neural mention pair classifier with supervised coreference training dataset. No matter how large the differences between these two methods, both of them are all implemented based on the KEE model."

      "heading" : "The Commonsense Knowledge",
      "text" : "There have been open commonsense knowledge bases in the artificial intelligence community, e.g. Cyc (Lenat 1995), ThoughtTreasure (Mueller 1998) and ConcepNet (Liu and Singh 2004). Cyc is an artificial intelligence project that attempts to assemble a comprehensive ontology and knowledge base of everyday common sense knowledge, with the goal to enable AI applications to perform human-like reasoning. Typical pieces of knowledge represented in the Cyc database are “every tree is a plant” and “plants die eventually”. ConceptNet is a semantic network containing lots of things computers should know about the world, especially when understanding text written by people. It is built from nodes representing words or short phrases of natural language, and labeled relationships between them. For ex-\nample, the triple (learn, MotivatedByGoal, knowledge) indicates that “we would learn because we want knowledge”. Those existing commonsense KBs are well constructed; however, in this paper, we aim to find commonsense knowledge for solving the WS and PDP problems by the following requirements: 1) to avoid data sparseness problem, the vocabulary of the KB covers common words (not phrases) in daily life, e.g., common verbs, adjectives, etc. 2) The commonsense relationships between the nodes in the vocabulary cover common relations, e.g. cause-effect, entailment, etc.\nBased on these two requirements, this paper proposes to use the KB constructed by a recent work (Liu et al. 2016), which collects word pairs with cause-effect relationships automatically. Figure 2 shows the typical formula of the corresponding KB.\nThe KB contains a large number of cause-effect word and phrase pairs constructed from large text corpora. The vocabulary covered by the KB contains thousands of common verbs and adjectives. At shown in Figure 2, there are four pattern roles for both the cause and effect phrases. The four roles include (active,positive), (active,negative), (passive,positive) and (passive,negative). Table 1 shows some examples. In this paper, all the word pairs (rather than phrase pairs) of this KB are used."

      "heading" : "Knowledge Enhanced Embedding",
      "text" : "To combine context and commonsense knowledge for solving the WS and PDP problems, this paper proposes to treat the commonsense knowledge as semantic constraints and learn knowledge enhanced embedding (KEE) based on the generated constraints. The idea to learn word embedding based on constraints is similar to the work of (Liu et al. 2015). The main difference is the way we generate the knowledge constraints. In this paper, we propose to create constraints as follows:\nKnowledge constraints Since all the cause-effect pairs used in this paper contain the corresponding confidence weights, i.e. PMI values, we propose to generate semantic inequalities by randomly sampling two cause-effect pairs. More specifically, for each cause-effect pair, we will randomly sample 5 different pairs from the whole KB set and construct the inequalities by comparing their PMI values respectively. For instance, once we generate cause-effect pair (wi, wj) and (wk, wg) and the PMI value of pair (wi, wj) is larger than pair (wk, wg), we can make the inequality as:\nsim(wi, wj) > sim(wk, wg) (1)\nThe idea to generate such inequality is similar to the physical meaning of lexical entailment (Geffet and Dagan 2005; Turney and Mohammad 2015). This paper assumes if a word tends to be the effect of another word, they should have similar context patterns. Note that the commonsense knowledge base used in this paper covers all the common verbs and adjectives, and the knowledge constraints would not influence the learning for the remaining words in the whole large vocabulary. This is important because the used verbs and adjectives play a central role in commonsense reasoning. Currently, incorporating more knowledge of other types of words, e.g., nouns, adverbs and prepositions is beyond our concern.\nThe main framework The main framework for learning knowledge enhanced embedding is shown in Figure 3.\nSemantic Word Embedding with Commonsense Knowledge\nThe left part in this framework is the typical skip-gram model, which learns continuous word vectors from text corpora based on the aforementioned distributional hypothesis (Mikolov et al. 2013). Each word in vocabulary (size of V ) is mapped to a continuous embedding space by looking up an embedding matrix W(1). And W(1) is learned by maximizing the prediction probability, calculated by another prediction matrix W(2), of its neighbouring words within a context window. Given a sequence of training data, denoted as w1, w2, w3, ..., wT with T words, the skip-gram model aims to maximize the objective function:\nQ = 1 T T∑ t=1 ∑ −c≤j≤c,j 6=0 log p(wt+j |wt) (2)\nwhere c is the size of context windows, wt denotes the input central word and wt+j for its neighbouring word. The skip-gram model computes the above conditional probability p(wt+j |wt) using the following softmax function:\np(wt+j |wt) = exp(w\n(2) t+j ·w (1) t )∑V\nk=1 exp(w (2) k ·w (1) t )\n(3)\nwhere w(1)t and w (2) k denotes row vectors in matrices W (1) and W(2), corresponding to word wt and wk respectively. In this paper, we proposed to incorporate the commonsense knowledge as constraints into the word embedding training process. Assume the knowledge is represented by a large number of inequalities, denoted as the set S. This paper denotes sij = sim(w (1) i ,w (1) j ) as the semantic similarity hereafter. The final objective function becomes:\n{W(1),W(2)} = arg max W(1),W(2) Q(W(1),W(2)) (4)\nsubject to sij > skg ∀(i, j, k, g) ∈ S. (5)\nIn this work, we formulate the above constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one by casting all the constraints as a penalty term in the objective function:\nQ′ = Q− β · D D = ∑\n(i,j,k,g)∈S\nf(i, j, k, g) (6)\nwhere β is a control parameter to balance the contribution of the penalty term in the optimization process. The function f(·) is a normalization function. This paper uses a hinge loss function like f(i, j, k, g) = h(skg − sij) where h(x) = max(0, x).\nThe objective function in eq. (6) could be optimized using the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. Generally, as shown in Figure 4, the work to combine context and commonsense knowledge is implemented in the proposed KEE model. After that, embeddings trained by the KEE would serve for the two methods (USSM and NKAM) designed to solve the WS and PDP problems in this paper."

We introduce a straightforward unsupervised semantic similarity method (USSM), which aims to\nrepresent the pronoun and all the candidate mentions by composing from the pre-trained KEE embeddings. For the composition function, we design to use the recently proposed approach, named fixed-size ordinally-forgetting encoding (FOFE) (Zhang et al. 2015).\nFor one sentence, the function FOFE works as follows. Given a sequence of words, S = {w1, w2, ..., wT }, each word wt is first represented by a 1-of-K representation et, from the first word t = 1 to the end of the sequence t = T , FOFE encodes each partial sequence (history) based on a simple recursive formula (with z0 = 0) as: zt = α · zt−1 + et, (1 ≤ t ≤ T ) (7) where zt denotes the FOFE code for the partial sequence up to wt, and α, (0 < α < 1) is a constant forgetting factor to control the influence of the history on the current position. Assume we have three symbols in vocabulary, e.g.,A,B, C, whose 1-of-K codes are [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] and [0, 0, 1] respectively. In this case, the FOFE code for the sequence {ABC} is [α2, α, 1], and that of {ABCBC} is [α4, α+α3, 1+α2]. In this paper, we first use the FOFE method to encode the context of each word into a fixed-size code (of the vocabulary size). Then, we use the embedding matrixW (1), learned by KEE as above, to project into a low-dimension space. These low-dimension vectors are used to calculate cosine distances to select the answer from the candidates."

Particularly, we utilize two Wikipedia corpora with different sizes. The first corpus of a smaller size is a data set containing the first one billion characters from Wikipedia3, named as Wiki-Small in our experiments. The second corpus of a relatively large size is a snapshot of the Wikipedia articles from (Shaoul 2010), named as Wiki-Large in our experiments. Both Wikipedia corpora have been pre-processed by removing all the HTML metadata and hyper-links and replacing the digit numbers with English words. After text normalization, the Wiki-Small corpus contains totally 130 million words, for which we create a lexicon of 225,909 distinct words appearing more than 5 times in the corpus. Similarly, the Wiki-Large corpus contains about 1 billion words, for which we create a lexicon of\n1Available at www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ papers/WinogradSchemas/PDPChallenge2016.xml.\n2Available at www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ papers/WinogradSchemas/WSCollection.xml.\n3http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwik9.zip.\n235,167 words, each appearing more than 60 times. In all the experiments of this paper, the settings for KEE are the same. The embedding dimension is set to be 100 while the context window size c in eq. (2) is set to be 5. The combination coefficient β in eq. (6) is set to be 0.01. The KEE models are trained by the stochastic gradient descents (SGD) algorithm. The initial learning rate is set as 0.025 and the learning rate is decreased linearly during the SGD model training process.\nSetup for USSM and NKAM As for feature extraction in the USSM or NKAM methods, for both pronouns and candidate mentions, the context we utilize for feature extraction is the entire sentence. Meanwhile, the weight α in eq. (7) is set to 0.7 for context composition. In the USSM method, we use the popular Cosine similarity to evaluate the semantic similarity between any two mentions. On the other hand, for the NKAM method, this paper uses the popular coreference resolution datasets, i.e., OntoNotes (Weischedel et al. 2013), to extract labelled mention pairs for model training. Considering the sentence length in the WS or PDP questions is usually less than 3, in this paper, we extract all the labelled mention pairs for pronouns within three adjacent sentences. We finally extract 306,903 training mention pairs. Meanwhile, the corresponding neural network has 1 hidden layer with 300 units. The non-linear activation function is rectified linear unit (ReLU) (Nair and Hinton 2010)."

      "text" : "Table 3 shows the overall results. We divide the results by the text corpus we used for KEE training. In addition to experimenting the proposed two methods, i.e., USSM and NKAM, we also construct a system by combing the USSM and NKAM methods. For each pronoun and its candidate mentions, the system combination procedure is implemented by interpolating the scores calculated by the USSM and NKAM method (the interpolation coefficient is 70% for NKAM and 30% for USSM). From the results, we find the USSM method (as the unsupervised method) achieves a 41.7% and 48.3% accuracy on the PDP test set when the KEE models are only trained on texts (no commonsense knowledge com-\nbined, which is equal to the skip-gram models) from WikiSmall and Wiki-Large. When we use the pre-trained knowledge enhanced embeddings (context+knowledge), the corresponding performance improves to 48.3% and 55.0%. Similar performances are achieved in NKAM and the combined system as well. In the combined system, we obtain a 61.7% accuracy on the PDP test set, which is significant better than the system (53.3%) constructed solely based on the context (without combining with commonsense knowledge). Meanwhile, since the WS test set is carefully designed by human beings, the performance of the baseline systems, i.e., all the results shown in the rows of “KEE settings = Context”, are poor. The best performance is 50.6% when using Wiki-Large as text corpus, in the combined system. This suggests that only relying on context is clearly not good enough. After applying KEE to the USSM and NKAM methods, we achieve a 52.8% accuracy on the whole Winograd schemas test set, which is 4.4% better than the corresponding system.\nConclusions This paper proposes a general knowledge enhanced embedding (KEE) framework to combine context and commonsense knowledge for solving the Winograd Schema (WS) and Pronoun Disambiguation Problems (PDP). The KEE is a flexible framework to learn distributed representations under the supervision of commonsense knowledge from large text corpus. Using the pre-trained KEE representations, we further proposes two methods, i.e. unsupervised semantic similarity method and neural knowledge activated method, to solve the WS and PDP problems. Experiments conducted on the official datasets show that these two methods achieve consistent improvements over the baseline systems.
