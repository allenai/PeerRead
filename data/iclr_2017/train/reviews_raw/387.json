CNN-based texture descriptors for image generation. Similar to Gatys et al., the method uses as texture descriptor the empirical intra-channel correlation matrix of the CNN feature response at some layer of a deep network. Differently from Gatys et al., longer range correlations are measured by introducing a shift between the correlated feature responses, which translates in a simple modification of the original architecture.\n\nThe idea is simple but has interesting effects on the generated textures and can be extended to transformations other than translation. While longer range correlations could be accounted for by considering the response of deeper CNN features in the original method by Gatys et al., the authors show that modelling them explicitly using shallower features is more effective, which is reasonable.\n\nAn important limitation that this work shares with most of its peers is the lack of a principled quantitative evaluation protocol, such that judging the effectiveness of the approach remains almost entirely a qualitative affair. While this should not be considered a significant drawback of the paper due to the objective difficulty of solving this open issue, nevertheless it is somewhat limiting that no principled evaluation method could be devised and implemented. The authors suggest that, as future work, a possible evaluation method could be based on a classification task -- this is a potentially interesting approach that merits some further investigation.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Simple modification of Gatys et al. that takes into account long-range correlations and gives visually pleasing synthesis results.", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a modification of the parametric texture synthesis model of Gatys et al. to take into account long-range correlations of textures. To this end the authors add the Gram matrices between spatially shifted feature vectors to the synthesis loss. Some of the synthesised textures are visually superior to the original Gatys et al. method, in particular on textures with very structured long-range correlations (such as bricks).\n\nThe paper is well written, the method and intuitions are clearly exposed and the authors perform quite a wide range of synthesis experiments on different textures.\n\nMy only concern, which is true for all methods including Gatys et al., is the variability of the samples. Clearly the global minimum of the proposed objective is the original image itself. This issue is partially circumvented by performing inpainting experiments, by which the synthesised paths needs to stay coherent with the borders (as the authors did). There are no additional insights into this problem in this paper, which would have been a plus.\n\nAll in all, this work is a simple and nice modification of Gatys at al. which is worth publishing but does not constitute a major breakthrough.\n\n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "15 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"TITLE": "Inpainting comparison with Gatys et al", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "comments": "", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "02 Dec 2016", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Significance of the method and assessing its quality", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "comments": "", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "25 Nov 2016", "is_meta_review": false}], "SCORE": 5, "authors": "Guillaume Berger, Roland Memisevic", "KEYWORDS": "We propose a simple extension to the Gatys et al. algorithm which makes it possible to incorporate long-range structure into texture generation.", "accepted": true, "id": ""}
