      "text" : "If we aim to compare different language portfolios (consisting of different languages at different proficiency levels), we need some way to measure it. Similar to IQ that is supposed to measure the intelligence, we need a “LQ” that measures linguistic intelligence.\nLinguistic intelligence for the scope of this article is the achieved proficiency in some set of languages, i.e. not the potential to learn fast a new one, but an achievement that already took place.\nThe main idea is that languages that are related to each other give less to the linguistic intelligence than those that are unrelated.\nWe will deploy actively the ideas and methods from finance. A sample of languages resembles to some extent a portfolio of assets.\nTo a given portfolio of assets it is more valuable to add an asset that is not correlated or even negatively correlated to the assets of a given portfolio (e.g. [Markowitz 52]).\nIn the same way for a given sample of languages (further, portfolio of languages) it is more valuable (in the sense of linguistic intelligence) to add a language that is not related to the languages of a given portfolio.\nThe article is organized as follows. In the section 3.1 we design the measure given the set of properties that sounds reasonable from the intuitive and logical point of view.\nIn the section 3.2 we turn this design into mathematical model that allows to calculate a score to a given portfolio of languages (it could be calculated for any language profile at lingvometer.com)."

      "text" : "We reason on properties the linguistic intelligence should have. Based on these principles we will later derive the formal rules.\nWe consider all the languages as equal to each other. It is not a trivial assumption since there are languages that have been developing over thousands of years a reach literary and oral traditions, serving as medium for the scientific expression etc.\nThere are other languages that fail to compete with the former on this account. It is tempting to say that they are less valuable. However, we still regard them as equal since the ”undeveloped” languages could be harder to acquire exactly because they don’t have the written tradition.\nPeople master the languages to the different extent. Assume that the proficiency degree of the grown-up educated native speaker is 1. Someone who never faced it has the level 0 in this language. It would be logical to demand that increasing the proficiency in some language of the portfolio would increase the LQ of the person.\nWe set the measure of the portfolio of n independent languages to be n, i.e. LQ of the portfolio of Spanish and Chinese would be 2.\nConsequently, measure of the portfolio of n languages, such that some of them are related to each other is less than n. Further, if we add to a portfolio a language that is already there then the measure of the portfolio must remain the same.\nThus, we would assign to the portfolio of two languages a number between 1 and 2. The closer they are, the closer is this number to 1. The further they are, the closer is this number to 2.\nWe interpret such a measure as the “real” (or effective) number of languages a person speaks.\nThus, one and one is two if we add Spanish to Chinese. If we add Spanish and Portuguese, then one and one could be something like 1.3, maybe a little bit less or a little bit more.\nThere are also other reasons than the time to learn a new language to assign a higher score to Spanish+Chinese than to Spanish+Portuguese. We could also argue that learning a distant language, one learns also new structures that are not there in the related language."

      "text" : "We write our considerations on how the LQ measure should behave in the following list of axioms. It was inspired by the idea of coherent risk measures [Artzner et al. 99] from financial mathematics.\nConsider a language l is an element of languages space L and weighted language w (in other words a language with proficiency level) is an element of the space W :=L× [0, 1] that is a language and a number between 0 and 1 (1 is a fluent command of a language, 0 means any knowledge is absent).\nPortfolio Π of N languages is an element of space WN . If needed we could also consider the portfolio Π of N languages to be an element of space LN (i.e. languages at fluent proficiency).\nDefinition: A linguistic intelligence measure (l.i.m.) is a function s.t. λ : WN → R\nIf we set all proficiency levels to 1, then l.i.m. is also defined on LN : λ : LN → R.\nNow, we formalize the arguments of the previous chapter as axioms. We consider all languages to be equal: Axiom E. Equivalence. ∀l ∈ L, l 6= ∅ : λ(l) = 1 A portfolio of languages weights at most as sum of its components: Axiom S. Subadditivity. For any 2 language portfolios it must hold: ∀Π1,Π2 ∈WN : λ(Π1 ∪Π2) ≤ λ(Π1) + λ(Π2) Axiom ND. No double-counting. For a language l that is in portfolio Π it must hold: l ∈ Π⇒ λ(Π ∪ l) = λ(Π) Axiom I. Independency. For a language l that is independent to any language in portfolio Π it must hold: Π ⊥ l⇒ λ(Π ∪ l) = λ(Π) + λ(l) Axiom PH. Positive homogeneity. Proficiency effect is linear. ∀c ∈ [0, 1],∀l ∈ L, w = (c, l) ∈W : λ(w) = cλ(l) Definition A linguistic measure is called coherent (c.l.i.m.) if it satisfies axioms E, S, D, I, PH. There are many measures that satisfy these axioms. We propose one in the next chapter. Even though a c.l.i.m. seems to be strictly defined since there are many requirement to be met, there are 2 key points in the whole construction that still leave the room for interpretation: how the language space is constructed and how the set-theoretic operations (independence and union) between elements of this space are defined. Later on, we will see 2 completely different construction approaches and further constructions are still possible.\nFurther, we observe the axioms from different points of view to understand them better. If the axiom E takes place, then axioms S, D and I lead to the\nfollowing inequality:\n∀Π ∈ LN ,∀l ∈ L : λ(Π) ≤ λ(Π ∪ l) ≤ λ(Π) + 1\nThus, adding a language to a portfolio adds a number between 0 and 1 to linguistic intelligence.\nThis inequality helps us to reduce the range of l.i.m., s.t. λ : LN → [1, N ] or in terms of W (with PH axiom) λ : WN → [0, N ].\nSimplifying further the inequality, we can write it for a portfolio of 2 languages as follows:\n∀l1, l2 ∈ L,Φ = (l1 ∪ l2) ∈ L2 : 1 ≤ λ(Φ) ≤ 2\nIf for some reason a space L is defined in such a way that it includes an empty element, then the axiom E must be adjusted such that λ(∅) = 0"

      "text" : "We consider the portfolios of languages to be a tree with hypothetical Tower of Babel (ToB) language as a source. A portfolio consisting of only one language would be a path from the source to the language through the language families, groups, subgroups etc classification.\nThe children of ToB are language families like Indo-European or SinoTibetan. This is the layer of nodes of rank 1, the languages are considered independent if they belong to different language families.\nThus, the language space LN is the full tree of all (N) languages. The languages are the leaves of the tree and portfolios are the induced subgraphs of the full graphs containing the source (ToB), leaves and the paths between them. Thus, a portfolio of 1 language would be a path from the source through all families, sub-families, groups etc to this language. The union of 2 portfolios would be the union of the corresponding subgraphs.\nTo illustrate it, consider a portfolio Π consisting of Chinese and Serbian and portfolio Φ consisting of English and Slovene. Then the unified portfolio Ψ = Π ∪ Φ would contain all 4 languages. The situation is illustrated on the figure 1.\nLet N be the maximal depth of the tree and Vr the set of all nodes of depth r. Initialize all languages with their proficiencies (not necessarily all hanging in the deepest layer).\nStarting from the deepest layer up to the source calculate for each node in the layer iteratively the LQ (bottom-up).\nDenote the LQ of the node v as λv and Ch(v) as the set of nodes which are the children of node v. For r = N, 0, ∀v ∈ Vr\nλv = ( ∑ c∈Ch(v) λ √ r c )√ 1 r\nWe define the result of the last step of this iterative process as LQ measure. The pseudocode for the algorithm both the straightforward way and the recursive way is given in the appendix.\nDefinition. LQ-measure is such a l.i.m. that LQ = λv, v ∈ V0\nThere’s only one node at the layer of depth 0 that is the root of the tree (Tower of Babel language). A numerical example is given in Appendix.\nIn the formula, we take the LQs of the nodes to the power of the root of the rank and not the root itself as on the real data it produces more intuitive results. Actually, taking instead of the root of the rank any monotone function of the rank with the fixed point at 1 (i.e. f(1) = 1) would give another c.l.i.m.:\nλv = ( ∑ c∈Ch(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r)\nLQ turns out to be coherent. Lemma. LQ is c.l.i.m. Proof. Axiom S. Consider the language portfolios Φ and Π that could have common elements (they have at least ToB in common). We could rewrite the children of the node as being the union of its children belonging to Π and its children belonging to Φ, then we algorithm to calculate LQ(Π ∪ Φ) looks as follows (again starting with the nodes from the bottom):\nλv = ( ∑ c∈ChΠ(v)∪ChΦ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r)\nThe algorithms to calculate LQ(Π) and LQ(Φ) are respectively\nλv = ( ∑ c∈ChΠ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r)\nand\nλv = ( ∑ c∈ChΦ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r)\nThe numbers λ(c) forms a vector from the space R#Ch(v), their Minkowski distance to the 0 vector with p = f(r) is λv. In case ChΦ(v) ∩ ChΠ(v) = ∅ the triangular inequality states that\nλv = ( ∑ c∈ChΠ(v)∪ChΦ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r) ≤ ( ∑ c∈ChΠ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r) + ( ∑ c∈ChΦ(v) λf(r)c ) 1 f(r)\nIf the intersection of the children for this node is not empty, then we have additional terms on the right side of the inequality and, thus, still holds. Note that on the right side of inequality we have the components that flow in calculation of LQ(Π) and LQ(Φ) respectively.\nThus, going from the bottom to the top, we will finally have\nLQ(Π ∪ Φ) ≤ LQ(Π) + LQ(Φ)\nThis satisfies the axiom S. Axiom I is satisfied due to the property of the formula that at the rank 1 (this level is considered to contain independent entities) the sum of LQs is linear (i.e. at no cost).\nAxioms E and PH are satisfied due to the fact that initialized with 1 (or with c ∈ [0, 1] in case PH) the LQ of the only language could be push up alone the path to the source at no cost.\nAxiom ND is satisfied due to the space construction. A shortcoming of the approach is that some language dependences are not captured by tree structure. For instance, the direct French influence on English could be represented by the edge between them. This would, however, destroy the tree structure.\nOne of the advantages is that the language tree data is easily available, for instance in [ethnologue 2015].\nOne could try the algorithm on different input at lingvometer.com"

      "heading" : "3.3 Matrix approach",
      "text" : "We have seen in the previous chapter the measure constructed on language trees. However, it does not have to be trees. In this chapter we will discuss an alternative approach, namely the one based on correlation matrices.\nThe entries of the matrices represent a correlation or language distance (more precisely 1 minus distance to make it look like a correlation) expressed as a number between 0 and 1. There are many works on measuring such a distance, to name a few [Petroni and Serva 2010], [Delsing and Åkesson 2005], [Koehn 2005], [Chiswick and Miller 2005], [Gingsburgh and Weber 2011]. They use different approaches: difficulty of acquiring a language, difficulty of machine translation between languages, number of words in common etc. Most of them cover rather a small part of all possible correlations/distances. With N languages, there must be N(N-1)/2 distances.\nThe same as stocks prices are correlated with the information stored in correlation matrices, we could also consider the languages to be correlated.\nWe try to construct a l.i.m. on 2× 2 matrices i.e. portfolios of 2 languages. The correlation matrix in this case looks like this:\n1 ρ ρ 1\nDenote it as M(ρ). Languages are independent if ρ = 0 and more dependent as ρ is closer to 1 with two languages being equal if ρ = 1. In order for the l.i.m. to be coherent, we need among other things λ(M(0)) = 2 and λ(M(1)) = 1 with λ being monotone decreasing on ρ. One such a c.l.i.m. is λ(M(ρ)) = 2−ρ. Axioms I and ND we checked above. The matrix of one language is simply 1, thus, axiom E holds as well. Axiom PH is not relevant on L2 space (it’s relevant only on WN spaces). Axiom S holds since 2− ρ ≤ 1 + 1 (0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1).\nIt is not the only c.l.i.m. on this space since a familty of c.l.i.m. could be constructed like this λ(M(ρ)) = 2− ρr, r > 0\nWe discussed a particular case that shows an example of c.l.i.m. on the matrix space. The general case is still open.\nOne of the shortcoming of the matrix approach is that the data on all N × (N − 1) dependencies is not available. Different studies assign if close, but still different numbers. Apparently, the tree data could be mapped to the matrix and vice versa (e.g. [Petroni and Serva 2008])."

      "text" : "We presented a sound way to measure a portfolio of languages. How could it be used except for measuring someone’s linguistic intelligence?\nThere is a broad field of research on intersection between economics and linguistics. An extensive overview could be found in [Grin 2003].\nLQ could be used for instance as communication cost function. An institut that evaluates several options as a working language(s), could aim to minimize the overall LQ of its members since it would also mean the minimization of communication costs. For example, the optimal language (or an optimal bundle of languages) for European Union could be chosen in such a way that the aggregated LQ of European population would be minimal.\nThe implementation of the LQ algorithm could be found at lingvometer.com"
