      "text" : "Word embeddings have proven to be beneficial in a variety of tasks in NLP such as machine translation (Zou et al., 2013), parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014), semantic search (Reinanda et al., 2015; Voskarides et al., 2015), and tracking the meaning of words and concepts over time (Kim et al., 2014; Kenter et al., 2015). It is not evident, however, how word embeddings should be combined to represent larger pieces of text, like sentences, paragraphs or documents. Surprisingly, simply averaging word embeddings of all words in a text has proven to be a strong baseline or feature across a multitude of tasks (Faruqui et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014; Gershman and Tenenbaum, 2015; Kenter and de Rijke, 2015).\nWord embeddings, however, are not optimized specifically for representing sentences. In this paper we present a model for obtaining word embeddings that are tailored specifically for the task of averaging them. We do this by directly including a comparison of sentence embeddings—the averaged embeddings of the words they contain—in the cost function of our network.\nWord embeddings are typically trained in a fast and scalable way from unlabeled training data. As the training data is unlabeled, word embeddings are usually not task-specific. Rather, word embeddings trained on a large training corpus, like the ones from (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b) are employed across different tasks (Socher et al., 2012; Kenter and de Rijke, 2015; Hu et al., 2014). These two qualities—(i) being trainable from large quantities of unlabeled data in a reasonable amount of time, and (ii) robust performance across different tasks—are highly desirable and allow word embeddings to be used in many large-scale applications. In this work we aim to optimize word embeddings for sentence representations in the same manner. We want to produce general purpose sentence embeddings that should score robustly across multiple test sets, and we want to leverage large amounts of unlabeled training material.\nIn the word2vec algorithm, Mikolov et al. (2013a) construe a supervised training criterion for obtaining word embeddings from unsupervised data, by predicting, for every word, its surrounding words. We apply this strategy at the sentence level, where we aim to predict a sentence from its adjacent sentences (Kiros et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016). This allows us to use unlabeled training data, which is easy to obtain; the only restriction is that documents need to be split into sentences and that the order between sentences is preserved.\nThe main research question we address is\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 64\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 Ju\nn 20\n16\nwhether directly optimizing word embeddings for the task of being averaged to produce sentence embeddings leads to word embeddings that are better suited for this task than word2vec does. Therefore, we test the embeddings in an unsupervised learning scenario. We use 20 evaluation sets that stem from a wide variety of sources (newswire, video descriptions, dictionary descriptions, microblog posts). Furthermore, we analyze the time complexity of our method and compare it to our baselines methods.\nSummarizing, our main contributions are: • We present Siamese CBOW, an efficient neural\nnetwork architecture for obtaining high-quality word embeddings, directly optimized for sentence representations; • We evaluate the embeddings produced by\nSiamese CBOW on 20 datasets, originating from a range of sources (newswire, tweets, video descriptions), and demonstrate the robustness of embeddings across different settings."

Quality should manifest itself in embeddings of semantically close sentences being similar to one another, and embeddings of semantically different sentences being dissimilar. An efficient and surprisingly successful way of computing a sentence embedding is to average the embeddings of its constituent words. Recent work uses pre-trained word embeddings (such as word2vec and GloVe) for this task, which are not optimized for sentence representations. Following these approaches, we compute sentence embeddings by averaging word embeddings, but we optimize word embeddings directly for the purpose of being averaged."

Specifically, for a pair of sentences (si, sj), we define a probability p(si, sj) that reflects how likely it is for the sentences to be adjacent to one another in the training data. We compute the probability p(si, sj) using a softmax function:\npθ(si, sj) = ecos(s\nθ i ,s θ j )∑\ns′∈S e cos(sθi ,s\nθ ′ ) , (1)\nwhere sθx denotes the embedding of sentence sx, based on the model parameters θ. In theory, the summation in the denominator of Equation 1 should range over all possible sentences S, which is not feasible in practice. Therefore, we replace the set S with the union of the set S+ of sentences that occur next to the sentence si in the training data, and S−, a set of n randomly chosen sentences that are not observed next to the sentence si in the training data. The loss function of the network is categorical cross-entropy:\nL = − ∑\nsj∈{S+ ∪S−}\np(si, sj) · log(pθ(si, sj)),\nwhere p(·) is the target probability the network should produce, and pθ(·) is the prediction it estimates based on parameters θ, using Equation 1. The target distribution simply is:\np(si, sj) =\n{ 1 |S+| , if sj ∈ S +\n0, if sj ∈ S−.\nI.e., if there are 2 positive examples (the sentences preceding and following the input sentence) and 2 negative examples, the target distribution is (0.5, 0.5, 0, 0)."

The cosine similarity between the two sentence vectors is produced as a final semantic similarity score.\nAs we want a clean way to directly evaluate the embeddings on multiple sets we train our model and the models we compare with on exactly the same training data. We do not compute extra features, perform extra preprocessing steps or incorporate the embeddings in supervised training schemes. Additional steps like these are very likely to improve evaluation scores, but they would obscure our main evaluation purpose in this paper, which is to directly test the embeddings."

(Zhu et al., 2015).\nWord2vec We average word embeddings trained with word2vec.2 We use both architectures, Skipgram and CBOW, and apply default settings: minimum word frequency 5, word embedding size 300, context window 5, sample threshold 10-5, no hierarchical softmax, 5 negative examples.\nSkip-thought As a second baseline we use the sentence representations produced by the skipthought architecture (Kiros et al., 2015).3 Skipthought is a recently proposed method that learns sentence representations in a different way from ours, by using recurrent neural networks. This allows it to take word order into account. As it trains sentence embeddings from unlabeled data, like we do, it is a natural baseline to consider.\nBoth methods are trained on the Toronto Book Corpus, the same corpus used to train Siamese CBOW. We should note that as we use skipthought vectors as trained by Kiros et al. (2015), skip-thought has an advantage over both word2vec and Siamese CBOW as the vocabulary used for encoding sentences contains 930,913 words, three times the size of the vocabulary that we use."

As Spearman’s r is often reported as well, we do so too.\nStatistical significance To see whether Siamese CBOW yields significantly different scores for the same input sentence pairs from word2vec CBOW—the method it is theoretically most similar to—we compute Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistics between all runs on all evaluation sets.

As we can see from the table, Siamese CBOW outperforms the baselines in the majority of cases (14 out of 20). The very low scores of skip-thought on MSRpar appear to be a glitch, which we will ignore.\nIt is interesting to see that for the set with the highest average sentence length (2013 SMT, with 24.7 words per sentence on average) Siamese CBOW is very close to skip-thought, the best performing baseline. In terms of lexical term overlap, unsurprisingly, all methods have trouble with the sets with little overlap (2013 FNWN, 2015 answers-forums, which both have 7% lexical overlap). It is interesting to see, however, that for the next two sets (2015 belief and 2012 MSRpar, 11% and 14% overlap respectively) Siamese CBOW manages to get the best performance. The highest performance on all sets is 0.7315 Pearson’s r of Siamese CBOW on the 2014 tweet-news set. This figure is not very far from the best performing SemEval run that year which has 0.792 Pearson’s r. This is remarkable as Siamese CBOW is completely unsupervised, while the NTNU system which scored best on this set (Lynum et al., 2014) was optimized using multiple training sets.\nIn recent work, Hill et al. (2016) present FastSent, a model similar to ours (see §5 for a more elaborate discussion); results are not reported for all evaluation sets we use, and hence, we compare the results of FastSent and Siamese CBOW separately, in Table 2.\nFastSent and Siamese CBOW each outperform the other on half of the evaluation sets, which clearly suggests that the differences between the two methods are complementary.5"

      "text" : "Ideally, the optimization criterion of a learning algorithm ranges over the full domain of its loss function. As discussed in §2, our loss function only observes a sample. As such, convergence is not guaranteed. Regardless, an ideal learning system should not fluctuate in terms of performance relative to the amount of training data it observes, provided this amount is substantial: as training proceeds the performance should stabilize.\nTo see whether the performance of Siamese CBOW fluctuates during training we monitor it during 5 epochs; at every 10,000,000 examples, and at the end of every epoch. Figure 2 displays the results for all 20 datasets. We observe that on the majority of datasets the performance shows very little variation. There are three exceptions. The performance on the 2014 deft-news dataset steadily decreases while the performance on 2013 OnWN steadily increases, though both seem to stabilize at the end of epoch 5. The most notable exception, however, is 2012 MSRvid, where the score, after an initial increase, drops consistently. This effect might be explained by the fact that this evaluation set primarily consists of very short sentences—it has the lowest average sentence length of all set: 6.63 with a standard deviation of 1.812. Therefore, a 300-dimensional representation appears too large for this dataset; this hypothesis is supported by the fact that 200- dimensional embeddings work slightly better for this dataset (see Figure 4)."

Choosing a higher number, like 10, occasionally leads to slightly better performance, e.g., on the 2013 FNWN set. However, a small number like 1 or 2 typically suffices, and is sometimes markedly better, e.g., in the case of the 2015 belief set. As\na high number of negative examples comes at a substantial computational cost, we conclude from the findings presented here that, although Siamese CBOW is robust against different settings of this\nparameter, setting the number of negative examples to 1 or 2 should be the default choice."

A dimensionality that is too low (50 or\n100) invariably leads to inferior results.

      "text" : "For learning systems, time complexity comes into play in the training phase and in the prediction phase. For an end system employing sentence embeddings, the complexity at prediction time is the most crucial factor, which is why we omit an analysis of training complexity. We focus on comparing the time complexity for generating sentence embeddings for Siamese CBOW, and compare it to the baselines we use.\nThe complexity of all algorithms we consider is O(n), i.e., linear in the number of input terms. As in practice the number of arithmetic operations is the critical factor in determining computing time, we will now focus on these.\nBoth word2vec and the Siamese CBOW compute embeddings of a text T = t1, . . . , t|T | by averaging the term embeddings. This requires |T |−1 vector additions, and 1 multiplication by a scalar value (namely, 1/|T |). The skip-thought model is a recurrent neural network with GRU cells, which computes a set of equations for every term t in T , which we reprint for reference (Kiros et al., 2015):\nrt = σ(Wrx t +Urh t−1) zt = σ(Wzx t +Uzh t−1) h t = tanh(Wxt +U(rt ht−1)) ht = (1− zt) ht−1 + zt ht\nAs we can see from the formulas, there are 5|T | vector additions (+/-), 4|T | element-wise multiplications by a vector, 3|T | element-wise operations and 6|T | matrix multiplications, of which the latter, the matrix multiplications, are most expensive.\nThis considerable difference in numbers of arithmetic operations is also observed in practice. We run tests on a single CPU, using identical code for extracting sentences from the evaluation sets,\nfor every method. The sentence pairs are presented one by one to the models. We disregard the time it takes to load models. Speedups might of course be gained for all methods by presenting the sentences in batches to the models, by computing sentence representations in parallel and by running code on a GPU. However, as we are interested in the differences between the systems, we run the most simple and straightforward scenario. Table 3 lists the number of seconds each method takes to generate and compare sentence embeddings for an input sentence pair. The difference between word2vec and Siamese CBOW is because of a different implementation of word lookup.\nWe conclude from the observations presented here, together with the results in §4.1, that in a setting where speed at prediction time is pivotal, simple averaging methods like word2vec or Siamese CBOW are to be preferred over more involved methods like skip-thought."

      "heading" : "4.4 Qualitative analysis",
      "text" : "As Siamese CBOW directly averages word embeddings for sentences, we expect it to learn that words with little semantic impact have a low vector norm. Indeed, we find that the 10 words with lowest vector norm are to, of, and, the, a, in, that, with, on, and as. At the other side of the spectrum we find many personal pronouns: had, they, we, me, my, he, her, you, she, I, which is natural given that the corpus on which we train consists of fiction, which typically contains dialogues.\nIt is interesting to see what the differences in related words are between Siamese CBOW and word2vec when trained on the same corpus. For example, for a cosine similarity > 0.6, the words related to her in word2vec space are she, his, my and hers. For Siamese CBOW, the only closely related word is she. Similarly, for the word me, word2vec finds him as most closely related word, while Siamese CBOW comes up with I and my. It seems from these few examples that Siamese CBOW learns to be very strict in choosing which words to relate to each other.\nFrom the results presented in this section we conclude that optimizing word embeddings for the task of being averaged across sentences with Siamese CBOW leads to embeddings that are effective in a large variety of settings. Furthermore, Siamese CBOW is robust to different parameter settings and its performance is stable across itera-\ntions. Lastly, we show that Siamese CBOW is fast and efficient in computing sentence embeddings at prediction time."

      "text" : "A distinction can be made between supervised approaches for obtaining representations of short texts, where a model is optimised for a specific scenario, given a labeled training set, and unsupervised methods, trained on unlabeled data, that aim to capture short text semantics that are robust across tasks. In the first setting, word vectors are typically used as features or network initialisations (Kenter and de Rijke, 2015; Hu et al., 2014; Severyn and Moschitti, 2015; Yin and Schütze, 2015). Our work can be classified in the latter category of unsupervised approaches.\nMany models related to the one we present here are used in a multilingual setting (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014b; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014a; Lauly et al., 2014). The key difference between this work and ours is that in a multilingual setting the goal is to predict, from a distributed representation of an input sentence, the same sentence in a different language, whereas our goals is to predict surrounding sentences.\nWieting et al. (2016) apply a model similar to ours in a related but different setting where explicit semantic knowledge is leveraged. As in our setting, word embeddings are trained by averaging them. However, unlike in our proposal, a margin-based loss function is used, which involves a parameter that has to be tuned. Furthermore, to select negative examples, at every training step, a computationally expensive comparison is made between all sentences in the training batch. The most crucial difference is that a large set of phrase pairs explicitly marked for semantic similarity has to be available as training material. Obtaining such high-quality training material is non-trivial, expensive and limits an approach to settings for which such material is available. In our work, we leverage unlabeled training data, of which there is a virtually unlimited amount.\nAs detailed in §2, our network predicts a sentence from its neighbouring sentences. The notion of learning from context sentences is also applied in (Kiros et al., 2015), where a recurrent neural network is employed. Our way of averaging the vectors of words contained in a sentence is more similar to the CBOW architecture\nof word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), in which all context word vectors are aggregated to predict the one omitted word. A crucial difference between our approach and the word2vec CBOW approach is that we compare sentence representations directly, rather than comparing a (partial) sentence representation to a word representation. Given the correspondence between word2vec’s CBOW model and ours, we included it as a baseline in our experiments in §3. As the skip-gram architecture has proven to be a strong baseline too in many settings, we include it too.\nYih et al. (2011) also propose a siamese architecture. Short texts are represented by tf-idf vectors and a linear combination of input weights is learnt by a two-layer fully connected network, which is used to represent the input text. The cosine similarity between pairs of representations is computed, but unlike our proposal, the differences between similarities of a positive and negative sentence pair are combined in a logistic loss function.\nFinally, independently from our work, Hill et al. (2016) also present a log-linear model. Rather than comparing sentence representations to each other, as we propose, words in one sentence are compared to the representation of another sentence. As both input and output vectors are learnt, while we tie the parameters across the entire model, Hill et al. (2016)’s model has twice as many parameters as ours. Most importantly, however, the cost function used in (Hill et al., 2016) is crucially different from ours. As words in surrounding sentences are being compared to a sentence representation, the final layer of their network produces a softmax over the entire vocabulary. This is fundamentally different from the final softmax over cosines between sentence representations that we propose. Furthermore, the softmax over the vocabulary is, obviously, of vocabulary size, and hence grows when bigger vocabularies are used, causing additional computational cost. In our case, the size of the softmax is the number of positive plus negative examples (see §2.1). When the vocabulary grows, this size is unaffected."

The model is trained using only unla-\nbeled text data. It predicts, from an input sentence representation, the preceding and following sentence.\nWe evaluated the model on 20 test sets and show that in a majority of cases, 14 out of 20, Siamese CBOW outperforms a word2vec baseline and a baseline based on the recently proposed skip-thought architecture. As further analysis on various choices of parameters show that the method is stable across settings, we conclude that Siamese CBOW provides a robust way of generating high-quality sentence representations.\nWord and sentence embeddings are ubiquitous and many different ways of using them in supervised tasks have been proposed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to provide a comprehensive analysis of all supervised methods using word or sentence embeddings and the effect Siamese CBOW would have on them. However, it would be interesting to see how Siamese CBOW embeddings would affect results in supervised tasks.\nLastly, although we evaluated Siamese CBOW on sentence pairs, there is no theoretical limitation restricting it to sentences. It would be interesting to see how embeddings for larger pieces of texts, such as documents, would perform in document clustering or filtering tasks."

Word embeddings, however, are not optimized specifically for representing sentences. In this paper we present a model for obtaining word embeddings that are tailored specifically for the task of averaging them. We do this by directly including a comparison of sentence embeddings—the averaged embeddings of the words they contain—in the cost function of our network. Word embeddings are typically trained in a fast and scalable way from unlabeled training data. As the training data is unlabeled, word embeddings are usually not task-specific. Rather, word embeddings trained on a large training corpus, like the ones from (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013b) are employed across different tasks (Socher et al., 2012; Kenter and de Rijke, 2015; Hu et al., 2014). These two qualities—(i) being trainable from large quantities of unlabeled data in a reasonable amount of time, and (ii) robust performance across different tasks—are highly desirable and allow word embeddings to be used in many large-scale applications. In this work we aim to optimize word embeddings for sentence representations in the same manner. We want to produce general purpose sentence embeddings that should score robustly across multiple test sets, and we want to leverage large amounts of unlabeled training material. In the word2vec algorithm, Mikolov et al. (2013a) construe a supervised training criterion for obtaining word embeddings from unsupervised data, by predicting, for every word, its surrounding words.",

However, word embeddings trained with the methods currently available are not optimized for the task of sentence representation, and, thus, likely to be suboptimal. Siamese CBOW handles this problem by training word embeddings directly for the purpose of being averaged. The underlying neural network learns word embeddings by predicting, from a sentence representation, its surrounding sentences. We show the robustness of the Siamese CBOW model by evaluating it on 20 datasets stemming from a wide variety of sources.",
