{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Program Synthesis for Character Level Language Modeling", "abstract": "We propose a statistical model applicable to character level language modeling and show that it is a good fit for both, program source code and English text. The model is parameterized by a program from a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows expressing non-trivial data dependencies. Learning is done in two phases: (i) we synthesize a program from the DSL, essentially learning a good representation for the data, and (ii) we learn parameters from the training data - the process is done via counting, as in simple language models such as n-gram.  Our experiments show that the precision of our model is comparable to that of neural networks while sharing a number of advantages with n-gram models such as fast query time and the capability to quickly add and remove training data samples. Further, the model is parameterized by a program that can be manually inspected, understood and updated, addressing a major problem of neural networks.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper introduces a novel method for language modeling which is suitable for both modeling programming language as well as natural language. The approach uses a program synthesis algorithm to search over program space and uses count-based estimation of the weights of the program. This is a departure from neural network-based approaches which rely on gradient descent, and thus are extremely slow to estimate. Count-based method such as regular n-gram models suffer because of their simplicity, i.e. not being able to model large context, and scaling badly as context increases. The proposed approach synthesizes programs using MCMC which learn context-sensitive probabilities using count-based estimation, and thus is both fast and able to model long-range context.\n\nExperiments on a programming language datasets, the linux kernel corpus, show that this method is vastly better than both LSTM and n-gram language models. Experiments on the Wikipedia corpus show that the method is competitive, but not better, to SOTA models. Both estimation and query time are significantly better than LSTM LMs, and competitive to n-gram LMs.\n\nIt's debatable whether this paper is suitable for ICLR, due to ICLR's focus on neural network-based approaches. However, in the interest of diversity and novelty, such \"outside\" papers should be accepted to ICLR. This paper is likely to inspire more research into fusion of program synthesis and machine learning methods, which was a popular theme at NIPS 2016.\n\n*Pros*\n1. Novel approach.\n2.

There was significant discussion about the replicability of the paper, although all reviewers seem interested in the methods. \n \n Pro:\n - There is strong originality to this work. One of the few submissions in the area not just using RNNs for LM.\n - The paper shows strong empirical results on PL language modeling, comparative results in natural language modeling, fast lookup compared to neural models, and presents a significantly different approach then the currently accepted NN methods. \n \n \n Cons:\n - The original draft has clarity issues. In particular the MCMC approach is very difficult to follow and lacks clear explanation for this community, the interpretability of the method is not demonstrated, and too much of the work is devoted to laying out the language itself. (Note The authors have gone out of their way to include an appendix which caused one reviewer to go from recommending strong rejection to weak rejection, but also requires a much larger submission size. While two reviewers do like the work, their reviews are mainly based on the empirical sucess at program language modeling.)\n \n Overall, the PCs have determined that this work deserves to appear at the conference.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Authors: Please post a response", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference", "comments": "Currently this paper has a quite controversial score 8/8/3. Generally reviewers seem quite willing to consider a paper like this for ICLR, particularly due to the experimental results, but are concerned that there is very-little-to-zero details given about the synthesis approach. This makes the details of the paper hard to check and unreplicable. \n\nIf you feel like there is something you can do to sway them on this point, now would be a great time to respond.

Critically the paper glosses over the major issues of demonstrating the proposed DSL is a valid probabilistic model and how training is performed to fit the model to data (there is clearly not a gradient-based training approach used). FInally the experiments feel incomplete without showing samples drawn from the generative model or analyzing the learned model to determine what it has learned. Overall I feel this paper does not describe the approach in enough depth for readers to understand or re-implement it.\n\nAlmost all of the model section is devoted to exposition of the DSL without specifying how probabilities are computed using this model and how training is performed. How are probabilities actually encoded? The DSL description seems to have only discrete decisions rather than probabilities.\n\nTraining is perhaps covered in previous papers but there needs to be some discussion of how it works here. Section 2.5 does not do enough to explain how training works or how any measure of optimality is achieved.\n\nGiven this model is quite a different hypothesis space from neural models or n-grams, looking and samples drawn from the model seems critical. The current experiments show it can score utterances relatively well but it would be very interesting if the model can sample more structured samples than neural approaches (for example long-range syntax constraints like brackets)", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016 (modified: 21 Jan 2017)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Novel approach to language modeling", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The authors propose a method for language modeling by first generating a program from a DSL, then learning the count-based parameters of that program. Pros include: The proposed method is innovative and highly different from standard LSTM-based approaches of late. The model should also be much quicker to apply at query time. Strong empirical results are obtained on modeling code, though there is some gap between the synthesis method and neural methods on the Hutter task. A detailed description of the language syntax is provided.\n\nCons/suggestions:\n- The synthesis procedure using MCMC is left very vague, even though being able to make this procedure efficient is one of the key questions.\n- The work builds on work from the PL literature; surely the related work could also be expanded and this work better put in context.\n- More compact/convincing examples of human interpretability would be helpful.\n\nOther comments\n- Training time evaluation in Table 1 should give basic information such as whether training was done on GPU/CPU, CPU specs, etc.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 8, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 2}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Novel approach, good results", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper introduces a novel method for language modeling which is suitable for both modeling programming language as well as natural language.
