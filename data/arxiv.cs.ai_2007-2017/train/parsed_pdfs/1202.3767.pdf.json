      "text" : "We present a distributed anytime algorithm for performing MAP inference in graphical models. The problem is formulated as a linear programming relaxation over the edges of a graph. The resulting program has a constraint structure that allows application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle. Subprograms are defined over individual edges and can be computed in a distributed manner. This accommodates solutions to graphs whose state space does not fit in memory. The decomposition master program is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations, while the solution converges monotonically with each iteration. Formulating the MAP inference problem as a linear program allows additional (global) constraints to be defined; something not possible with message passing algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm’s solution quality outperforms most current algorithms and it scales well to large problems."

      "text" : "Undirected graphical models are powerful tools for modelling many real world problems. They have been successfully applied to a diverse set of problems such as: image processing [1], protein design [2], and text labelling [3]. One desirable operation on such models is to infer their most probable configuration; the maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem. For tree-structured graphs algorithms exist that are guaranteed to compute the globally optimal MAP solution in polynomial time (see for example: [4, 5]).\nFinding the MAP solution for arbitrary graphs has been proven to be NP-hard [6]. For such graphs ap-\nproximation algorithms are required to generate solutions in a feasible time-span. One particularly popular algorithm is based on Max-Product Belief Propagation due to Pearl [5]. Max-Product is exact for treestructured graphs. For arbitrary graphs the algorithm has been adapted such that it runs for a number of iterations and is known as Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP, see [7]). LBP has (at best) weak guarantees on convergence and optimality, i.e. local optimality or guarantees for specific types of loopy graphs. Despite this, the algorithm has been shown to generate good results for a large number of problems.\nIn this paper we propose a novel algorithm for the MAP inference problem of graphical model G = (V,E). Starting from a quadratic formulation over the nodes, s ∈ V (analogous to [8]), the problem is transformed into an integer formulation over the edges, (s, t) ∈ E. It is subsequently relaxed into a Linear Program (LP). The transformation from quadratic to linear increases both the number of variables (O(|V |k) → O(|E|k2)) as well as constraints (O(|V |) → O(|E| +  s∈V (|N (s)|− 1)k)). Where for ease of notation each node has k states, while N (s) are the neighbours of node s. The resulting LP formulation is equivalent to the standard MAP LP formulation (see for example [9]). However, defining the LP over the edge variables has certain advantages as discussed next.\nFor problems where the proposed LP relaxation fits into memory any LP solver may be used to compute the optimal solution directly. For medium to largescale problems there may not be sufficient memory available to solve the LP. Our algorithm is particularly suited for these cases as we explore the structure of the constraints to allow the application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle [10]. The decomposition principle reformulates the LP into a number of subprograms, one for each edge in our case, together with a master program. The subprograms can be solved independently and distributed, while the\nmaster program solves for the optimal solution using a significantly reduced number of variables. The algorithm is solved iteratively, solutions to the subprograms are used to update the master program and vice versa. At each iteration the decomposition principle guarantees that the solution will be closer to the optimal solution, i.e. an anytime algorithm.\nThe advantages of our algorithm are: 1) it is able to solve very complex problems that few other algorithms are able to solve; 2) it scales well for large problems and allows the use of linear programming even for graphs where the state space does not fit in memory; 3) it can be distributed and effectively use the multicore hardware currently available and; 4) it allows the definition of global constraints which are difficult to enforce in message-passing based algorithms. This is important for a number of real-world problems involving graph matching and data association."

      "text" : "Several variants of Max-Product Belief Propagation have been proposed. Generalised Belief Propagation [11] extends the message passing from pairs of connected nodes to higher order cliques resulting in better approximations. Tree-Reweighted Max-Product methods (TRW, [12, 13]) on the other hand decompose the original graph into a convex combination of treestructured graphs. The tree-structured graphs guarantee efficient computations, while the convex combination allows the computation of an upper bound on the optimal solution. However, Yanover et al. [14] showed that TRW fails to solve the problems used in the experiments of section 5.1.\nTRW has strong connections to the Max-Product Linear Programming (MPLP) algorithm proposed by Globerson and Jaakkola [15]. MPLP is defined as a block coordinate descent in the dual of a LP relaxation constrained by the local marginal polytope. MPLP has all the advantages of message passing algorithms but it also has strong convergence guarantees. However, as the problem is solved in the dual, it means optimising an upper bound and not the MAP problem directly. As a result, MPLP is also unable to solve most of the problems used in the experiments (see section 5.1). The method developed by Sontag et al. [2, 16] is considered the state of the art in MAP inference. It extends MPLP by iteratively adding clusters to the MPLP formulation thus approximating the marginal polytope.\nKomodakis et al. [17] solve the MAP problem by decomposition. Starting from the same LP relaxation as MPLP, the problem is transformed into its unconstrained dual Lagrangian using Lagrange multipliers.\nIn the dual the problem is decomposed, where each sub problem is formed by a spanning tree (similar to TRW methods). The solutions of the sub problems are used in a projected sub-gradient method to update the potential values. However, their method (Dual Decomposition, DD) requires all potential values to be updated and communicated to each sub problem. Thus making this approach sub-optimal for problems with large state spaces.\nRavikumar and Lafferty [8] formulate the MAP problem as a Quadratic Program (QP) relaxation. QP relaxations are a more natural fit to the MAP problem as pair-wise potentials are quadratic in nature. For many practical problems the QP relaxation is non-convex, thus requiring further approximations in order to produce an algorithm that is solvable in polynomial time. The drawback to using a QP relaxation is that it requires memory squared in the number of states. So for medium to large scale problems this approach quickly becomes impractical. In addition, the QP relaxation has been shown to generate poorer results compared to a LP relaxation [18].\nMore recently, Kumar and Zilberstein [19] approached the MAP estimation problem with an interesting mean field approximation method. Their method approximates the problem by considering only distributions that factorise as a product of distributions over individual nodes. The resulting non-convex problem is represented by an equivalent mixture of Bayes nets with one network for each edge. ExpectationMaximisation (EM, [20]) is subsequently used to derive a message passing algorithm. The EM message passing algorithm is computationally efficient but sensitive to initial conditions.\nThe performance of message passing algorithms degrades significantly for large scale problems. Due to memory restrictions it may not be possible to keep all pair-wise potentials in memory. In such cases, potentials will have to be recomputed with each message sent. This is not an algorithmic issue but a practical one, nonetheless it adds to the computational cost. In addition large messages need to be constructed, again increasing the cost. Our approach does not suffer this limitation as it is intrinsically distributed. Edge potentials are computed only once for each distributed subprogram. Furthermore, our approach permits specification of constraints on the solution; something not possible with the above methods. Finally, we show that our algorithm is able to solve graphs that TRW methods and MPLP ([12, 13] and [15] respectively) are unable to solve, since our method solves the primal directly rather than optimise a bound."

      "text" : "An undirected graphical model G = (V,E) represents a probability distribution pG(x1, . . . , xN ) overN = |V | variables. The vertices s ∈ V of the graph index the random variables xs of the distribution, while the edges (s, t) ∈ E of the graph capture relationships between variables xs and xt. Let C be the set of all cliques of the graph. The distribution must factor as a product of clique potentials φc(Xc), where c ∈ C and Xc are the clique’s variables. Yedidia et al. [11] showed that, without loss of generality, it is possible to assume that the graph is a pair-wise Markov Random Field, i.e. the set of cliques CM = {(s, t) ∈ E}. As a result, the log of the distribution of X = {x1, . . . , xN}, for the graph G with potentials Φ = {φc|c ∈ CM} is given by:\nlog pG(X;Φ) = \ns∈V φs(xs)+\n\n(s,t)∈E\nφst(xs, xt)− C, (1)\nwhere C is the log of the partition function. In the remainder we only consider variables xs that take on values from a finite discrete set Xs. Each xs is a vector of length |Xs| with elements xis ∈ {0, 1} and  i x i s = 1. Furthermore, without loss of generality we include the local potentials in the pair-wise potentials. For discrete graphical models the combined pair-wise potential may then be expressed as:\nQst = φst + (eφ T s )/|N (s)|+ (φteT )/|N (t)|, (2)\nwhere N (s) is the set of neighbours of node s. Division by the number of neighbours distributes the local potential evenly over the pair-wise potentials while leaving the MAP value unaltered. The vector e is an appropriately sized vector of 1s. This leads to the following quadratic integer MAP problem,\nX MAP = argmax\nX log pG(X;Φ)\n= argmax X\n\n(s,t)∈E\nx T s Qstxt. (3)\nFor small scale problems equation 3 may be solved by a QP relaxation. However, for medium or large scale problems the resulting relaxation will quickly become too large to fit into memory. Instead we reformulate the quadratic objective function into a LP by substitution. The substitution transforms the problem from an optimisation over the nodes into one over the edges with a constraint structure that allows the LP to be solved in a distributed manner.\nFor each edge (s, t) ∈ E define the edge variable\nyst = (x i sx j t |i = 1, . . . , |Xs|, j = 1, . . . , |Xt|, (s, t) ∈ E) (4)\nwhich, by the discrete nature of xs and xt, has elements ykst ∈ {0, 1} and  k y k st = 1 (k = 1, . . . , |Xs||Xt|). Equally, the cost cst can be constructed from Qst by ordering the elements of Qst into a vector corresponding to the elements of yst. The LP relaxation to the MAP problem is then formulated as:\nMaximise (s,t)∈E c T styst Subject to Astyst −Asuysu = 0 ∀s ∈ V, t ∈ N (s),\n∀u ∈ N (s) \\ t k y k st = 1 ∀(s, t) ∈ E 0 ≤ ykst ≤ 1 ∀(s, t) ∈ E, k = 1, . . . , |Xs||Xt|.\n(5)\nThe constraints defined by the matrix coefficients Ast are the consistency constraints. The elements of Ast are 0 or 1 such that Ai,•st yst = x i s, where A i,• st is the i-th row of Ast. Consistency constraints are discussed in more detail in section 3.1. The second set of constraints express a uniqueness of solution for each edge; only one element of the edge variable yst may be active. While the third set of constraints capture the relaxation from an integer program to a linear program.\nEquation 5 is equivalent to standard MAP LP formulation (see for example [9]). The advantage of using equation 5 over the standard formulation is that it has fewer variables and constraints. The reduction in variables is straightforward since local potentials (variables) are included in the pair-wise variables. The constraints are less obvious but more important. As shall be shown in section 4, the communication overhead is proportional to the number of constraints; fewer constraints are preferable. For problems with large state space and small treewidth, equation 5 has significantly fewer constraints compared to variables (section 5.2 contains an example). As a result the proposed method will have a smaller communications overhead compared to, for example, the Dual Decomposition method [17]."

Using the Resolution Theorem, equations of the form of equation 7 can be transformed into a master program together with K subprograms.

One common approach to initialising Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition is using a Simplex Phase 1 approach [10, Section 10.2.4]. This involves finding the maxima of each subprogram using the actual costs. The resulting solutions are used to start the master program. However, in our case the subprograms are trivial. This generally means that the consistency constraints are violated, thus preventing the decomposition from even starting. Instead when no additional requirements are specified, the procedure of algorithm 1 can be used to find an initial basic feasible solution in one step.\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudo-code of algorithm initialisation.\n1: Input: Graph G = (V,E), potentials φs, ∀s ∈ V and φst, ∀(s, t) ∈ E 2: Output: Initial basic feasible solution {ỹst|∀(s, t) ∈ E} 3: for s ∈ V do 4: φ̃← φs 5: for t ∈ N (s) do 6: φ̃← φ̃+\n xt φst\n7: end for 8: x̃s ← argmaxxs(φ̃) 9: end for\n10: for (s, t) ∈ E do 11: ỹst ← (x̃isx̃ j t |i = 1, . . . , |Xs|, j = 1, . . . , |Xt|) 12: end for\nAs can be seen from algorithm 1, a node’s initial solution x̃s is found by maximising over the sum of local and marginalised pair-wise potentials.

Since the initial solutions ỹst are based on node solutions, the consistency constraints are always met. The subprograms’ initial basic feasible solutions are subsequently used to get the decomposition master program started.\nWhen additional requirements (see section 3.2) are specified the above procedure is not guaranteed to find an initial basic feasible solution. In such cases one can adjust line 8 such that it takes account of additional requirements. If this is not possible then an initial solution will have to be obtained via other means. This requires replacing the for-loop on line 3. For example, many solution constraints allow a trivial solution, x̃s can be initialised with this trivial solution. In the more general case, algorithms that solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (see for example [21]) can be used to find an initial solution for x̃s."

Instead of adding all prospective columns to the master program, a limited number of columns may be added at each iteration. In such cases columns are selected based on their cost. At iteration i only columns corresponding to maximal costs gist are added (similar to pivoting in the simplex method).\nWith each iteration the master program will grow in size. It is possible that, after a number of iterations, the master program will become too complex for the solver to find a solution efficiently. In such situations the master program can be reduced in size and complexity simply by removing non-basic columns. Removal of non-basic columns does not impact on the solution quality as a LP solves a convex optimisation problem. It will however impact on the number of iterations until convergence. With more columns available the decomposition is able to find the optimal solution in fewer iterations, but it may take longer to solve each individual iteration.\nColumn generation procedures, such as Dantzig-Wolfe\nDecomposition, have the desirable property that both the size as well as the growth of the master program can be controlled.

Compared to the Side-Chain Prediction problem of section 5.1, this problem is not as difficult to optimise (the distribution is quite peaked).

Once the master program takes more than 2.5 seconds to solve, all non-basic columns are removed. Finally, the algorithm is run for a maximum of 250 iterations or until convergence. The comparisons are given in table 2 while figure 3 shows partial matching results for a single graph.\nIn figure 3 the blue crosses and red stars represent positions of an object measured by the laser range finder. The range finder will measure the same object but from different poses. The aim is to find unique matches between blue crosses and red stars represented by the black lines.\nThe results of table 2 show that our algorithm pro-\nduces a higher accuracy compared to LBP. The removal of many-to-one matches is particularly important for scan matching. However, LBP matches several points of an object in one set to the same point in the other set (figure 3), something not physically possible with rigid objects. Our DW-LP algorithm permits constraints on the solution, thereby eliminating all many-to-one matches and preserving object rigidity."

      "text" : "Many real-world problems are characterised, not only by the difficulty in solving them, but also by the size of the problem and constraints on its solution. Such problems require a different approach in algorithm design.\nThis paper presented a novel algorithm for distributed MAP inference based on LP decomposition. Unlike other LP (or QP) formulations ours is defined over edge variables instead of node variables. The advantage of such a formulation is that the LP has fewer constraints and allows decomposition into a number of subprograms (one for each edge) together with a small master program. The subprograms can be distributed over a network to allow large-scale problems to be solved efficiently. In addition, the master program monotonically converges to its optimal solution\nresulting in an anytime algorithm for performing MAP inference.\nExperimental results show that the algorithm finds solutions comparable to current state-of-the-art and scales well to large problems. Additionally, the experiments showed that the algorithm can successfully be applied to problems that involve global constraints; a difficult task for message-passing based algorithms."

    "abstractText" : "We present a distributed anytime algorithm for performing MAP inference in graphical models. The problem is formulated as a linear programming relaxation over the edges of a graph. The resulting program has a constraint structure that allows application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle. Subprograms are defined over individual edges and can be computed in a distributed manner. This accommodates solutions to graphs whose state space does not fit in memory. The decomposition master program is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations, while the solution converges monotonically with each iteration. Formulating the MAP inference problem as a linear program allows additional (global) constraints to be defined; something not possible with message passing algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm’s solution quality outperforms most current algorithms and it scales well to large problems.",
