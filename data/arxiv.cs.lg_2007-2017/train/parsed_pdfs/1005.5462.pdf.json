INTRODUCTION\nNMF is a matrix approximation technique that factorizes a nonnegative matrix into a pair of other nonnegative matrices of much lower rank:\nA ≈ BC, (1)\nwhere A ∈ RM×N+ = [a1, . . . , aN ] denotes the featureby-item data matrix, B ∈ RM×K+ = [b1, . . . ,bK ] denotes the basis matrix, C ∈ RK×N+ = [c1, . . . , cN ] denotes the coefficient matrix, and K denotes the number of factors which usually chosen so that K ≪ min(M,N). There are also other variants of NMF like semi-NMF, convex NMF, and symmetric NMF. Detailed discussions can be found in, e.g., [3] and [4].\nThe nonnegativity constraints and the reduced dimensionality define the uniqueness and power of NMF. The nonnegativity constraints allow only nonsubstractive linear combinations of the basis vectors bk to construct the data vectors an, thus providing the parts-based interpretations as shown in [5], [6], [7]. And the reduced dimensionality provides NMF with the clustering aspect and data compression capabilities.\nThe most important NMF’s application is in the data clustering, as some works have shown that it is a superior method compared to the standard clustering methods like spectral methods and K-means algorithm. In particular, Xu et al. [1] showed that NMF outperforms standard spectral methods in finding the document clustering in two text corpora, TDT2 and Reuters. And Kim et al. [2] showed that NMF and sparse NMF are much more superior methods compared to the K-means algorithm in both a synthetic dataset (which is well separated) and a real dataset (TDT2).\nIf sparsity constraints are imposed to columns of C, the clustering aspect of NMF is intuitive since in the extreme case where there is only one nonzero entry per column, NMF will be equivalent to the K-means algorithm employed to the data vectors an [8], and the sparsity constraints can be thought as the relaxation to the strict orthogonality constraints on rows of\nC (an equivalent explanation can also be stated for imposing sparsity on rows of B).\nHowever, as reported by Xu et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2], even without imposing sparsity constraints, NMF still can give very promising clustering results. But the authors didn’t give any theoretical analysis on why the standard NMF—NMF without sparsity nor orthogonality constraint—can give such good results. So far the best explanation for this remarkable fact is only qualitative: the standard NMF produces nonorthogonal latent semantic directions (the basis vectors) that are more likely to correspond to each of the clusters than those produced by the spectral methods, thus the clustering induced from the latent semantic directions of the standard NMF are better than clustering by the spectral methods [1]. Therefore, this work attempts to provide a theoretical support for the clustering aspect of the standard NMF."

      "text" : "To compute B and C, usually eq. 1 is rewritten into a minimization problem in the Frobenius norm criterion.\nmin B,C\nJ (B,C) = 1\n2 ‖A−BC‖2F s.t. B ≥ 0,C ≥ 0. (2)\nIn addition to the usual Frobenius norm criterion, the family of Bregman divergences—which Frobenius norm and KullbackLeibler divergence are part of it—can also be used as the affinity measures. Detailed discussion on the Bregman divergences for NMF can be found in [9].\nSometimes it is more practical and intuitive to decompose J (B,C) into a series of smaller objectives.\nmin B,C J (B,C) ≡\n(\nmin B,c1 J1(B, c1), . . . , min B,cN JN (B, cN )\n)\n,\n(3)\nwhere\nmin B,cn\nJn (B, cn) = 1\n2 ‖an −Bcn‖ 2 2, n ∈ [1, N ]. (4)\nMinimizing Jn is known to be the nonnegative least square (NLS) problem, and some fast NMF algorithms are developed based on solving the NLS subproblems, e.g., alternating NLS with block principal pivoting algorithm [10], active set method [11], and projected quasi-Newton algorithm [12]. Decomposing NMF problem into NLS subproblems also transforms the non-convex optimization in eq. 3 to the convex optimization subproblems in eq. 4. Even though eq. 4 is not strictly convex,\nfor two-block case, any limit point of the sequence {Bt,Ct}, where t is the updating step, is a stationary point [13].\nThe objective in eq. 4 aims to simultaneously find the suitable basis vectors such that the latent factors are revealed, and the coefficient vector cn such that a linear combination of the basis vectors (Bcn) is close to an. In clustering term this can be rephrased as: to simultaneously find the cluster centers and the cluster assignments.\nTo investigate the clustering aspect of NMF, four possibilities of NMF settings are discussed: (1) imposing orthogonality constraints on both rows of C and columns of B, (2) imposing orthogonality constraints on rows of C, (3) imposing orthogonality constraints on columns of B, and (4) no orthogonality constraint is imposed. The last case is the standard NMF which its clustering aspect is the focus of this paper as many works reported that it is a very effective clustering method."

By using the fact tr(XTX) = ‖X‖2F , eq. 24 can be rewritten as:\nmin B\n∥ ∥B T B ∥ ∥ 2\nF = min\nB\n(∑\ni\n( b T i bi )2 + ∑\ni6=j\n( b T i bj\n)2 )\n.\n(25) The objective in eq. 22 is equivalent to eq. 15 and eventually leads to the clustering of similar items. So the remaining problem is how to prove that optimizing eq. 23 and 25 simultaneously will lead to the feature clustering indicator matrix B which is approximately column-orthogonal.\nEq. 23 resembles eq. 14, but without orthogonality nor upper bound constraint, so one can easily optimizing eq. 23 by setting B to an infinity matrix. However, this violates eq. 25 which favors small B. Conversely, one can optimizing eq. 25 by setting B to a null matrix, but again this violates eq. 23. Therefore, these two objectives create implicit lower and upper bound constraints on B, and eq. 23 and eq. 25 can be rewritten into:\nmax B\ntr ( B T ÂB ) , and (26)\nmin B\n(∑\ni\n( b T i bi )2\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\njb1\n+ ∑\ni6=j\n( b T i bj )2\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\njb2\n)\n(27)\ns.t. 0 ≤ B ≤ ΥB,\nwhere Â denotes the feature affinity matrix and ΥB denotes the upperbound constraints on B. Now we have box-constraint objectives which are known to behave well and are guaranteed to converge to the stationary point [15].\nEven though the objectives are now transformed into boxconstraint optimization problems, since there is no columnorthogonality constraint, maximizing eq. 26 can be easily done by setting each entry of B to the corresponding largest possible value (in graph term this means to only create one partition on G(Â)). But this scenario results in the maximum value of eq. 27, which violates the objective. Conversely, minimizing eq. 27 to the smallest possible value (minimizing jb1 implies minimizing jb2, but not vice versa) violates eq. 26.\nThus, the most reasonable scenario is: setting jb2 as small as possible and balancing jb1 with eq. 26. This scenario is the relaxed ratio association applied to G(Â), and as long as vertices of G(Â) are clustered, simultaneous optimizing eq. 26 and eq. 27 leads to the clustering of related features. Moreover, as jb2 is minimum, B is approximately column-orthogonal."

However as their proofs utilize the zero gradient conditions, the hidden assumptions (setting the Lagrange multipliers to zeros) are not revealed there. Actually it can be easily shown that their approach is the KKT conditions applied to the unconstrained version of eq. 2.
