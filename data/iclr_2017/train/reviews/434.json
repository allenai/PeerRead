{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Recurrent Batch Normalization", "abstract": "We propose a reparameterization of LSTM that brings the benefits of batch normalization to recurrent neural networks. Whereas previous works only apply batch normalization to the input-to-hidden transformation of RNNs, we demonstrate that it is both possible and beneficial to batch-normalize the hidden-to-hidden transition, thereby reducing internal covariate shift between time steps.  We evaluate our proposal on various sequential problems such as sequence classification, language modeling and question answering. Our empirical results show that our batch-normalized LSTM consistently leads to faster convergence and improved generalization.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "Contributions\nThe paper presents an adaptation of batch normalization for RNNs in the case of LSTMs, along the horizontal depth.

The fact that it has already been cited a variety of times also speaks to its interest within the community. The extensive experiments are convincing that the method works. One common criticism is that the authors don't address enough the added computational cost of the method in the text or empirically. Plots showing loss as a function of wall-clock time instead of training iteration would be more informative to readers deciding whether to use batch norm. \n \n Pros: \n - Gets batch normalization to work on recurrent networks (which had been elusive to many)\n - The experiments are thorough and demonstrate the method reduces training time (as a function of training iterations)\n - The paper is well written and accessible\n \n Cons\n - The contribution is relatively incremental (several tweaks to an existing method)\n - The major disadvantage to the approach is the added computational cost, but this is conspicuously not addressed.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Batch normalisation brought to LSTM", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper shows that BN, which does not work out of the box for RNNs, can be used with LSTM when the operator is applied to the hidden-to-hidden and the input-to-hidden contribution separately.
