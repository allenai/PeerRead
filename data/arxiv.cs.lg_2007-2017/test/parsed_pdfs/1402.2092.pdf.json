      "text" : "Crowdsourcing services, such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform1 (henceforth MTurk), are becoming vital for outsourcing information processing to large groups of workers. Machine learning, AI, and citizen science systems can hugely benefit from the use of these services as large-scale annotated data is often of crucial importance (Snow et al., 2008; Sorokin & Forsyth, 2008; Lintott et al., 2008). Data collected from such services however is often noisy, e.g., due to spamming, inexpert or careless workers (Sorokin & Forsyth, 2008). As the accuracy of the\n1MTurk: https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\nCopyright 2014 by the author(s).\nannotated data is often crucial, the problem of tackling noise from crowdsourcing services has received considerable attention. Most of the work so far has focused on methods for combining labels from many annotators (Welinder et al., 2010; Gomes et al., 2011; Dalvi et al., 2013) or in designing control measures by estimating the worker’s reliabilities through “gold standard” questions (Snow et al., 2008).\nIn this paper, we explore an orthogonal direction: can we teach workers in crowdsourcing services in order to improve their accuracy? That is, instead of designing models and methods for determining workers’ reliability, can we develop intelligent systems that teach workers to be more effective? While we focus on crowdsourcing in this paper, similar challenges arise in other areas of data-driven education. As running examples, in this paper we focus on crowdsourcing image labeling. In particular, we consider the task of classifying animal species, an important component in several citizen science projects such as the eBird project (Sullivan et al., 2009).\nWe start with a high-level overview of our approach. Suppose we wish to teach the crowd to label a large set of images (e.g., distinguishing butterflies from moths). How can this be done without already having access to the labels, or a set of informative features, for all the images (in which case crowdsourcing would be useless)? We suppose we have ground truth labels only for a small “teaching set” of examples. Our premise is that if we can teach a worker to classify this teaching set well, she can generalize to new images. In our approach, we first elicit—on the teaching set—a set of candidate features as well as a collection of hypotheses (e.g., linear classifiers) that the crowd may be using. We will describe the concrete procedure used in our experimental setup in Section 5. Having access to this information we use a teaching algorithm to select training examples and steer the learner towards the target hypothesis.\nClassical work on teaching classifiers (reviewed in Section 2.2), assumes that learners are noise-free: Hypotheses are immediately eliminated from consideration upon ob-\nar X\niv :1\n40 2.\n20 92\nv4 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n7 M\nar 2\n01 4\nservation of an inconsistent training example. As we see in our experiments (Section 6), such approaches can be brittle. In contrast, we propose a noise-tolerant stochastic model of the learners, capturing our assumptions on how they incorporate training examples. We then (Section 4) propose STRICT (Submodular Teaching for cRowdsourcIng ClassificaTion), a novel teaching algorithm that selects a sequence of training examples to the workers in order to steer them towards the true hypothesis. We theoretically analyze our approach, proving strong approximation guarantees and teaching complexity results. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and STRICT policy on three real image annotation tasks, carried out on the MTurk platform."

      "text" : "Let X denote a set of examples (e.g., images), called the teaching set. We use (x, y) to denote a labeled example where x ∈ X and y ∈ {−1, 1}. We denote by H a finite class of hypotheses. Each element of H is a function h : X 7→ R. The label assigned to x by hypothesis h is sgn(h(x)). The magnitude |h(x)| indicates the confidence hypothesish has in the label ofx. For now, let us assume that X and H are known to both the teacher and the learner. In our image classification example, each image may be given by a set of features x, and each hypothesis h(x) = wTh x could be a linear function. In Section 5, we discuss the concrete hypothesis spaces used in our crowdsourcing tasks, and how we can elicit them from the crowd.\nThe teacher has access to the labels y(x) of all the examples x inX . We consider the realizable setting whereH contains a hypothesis h∗ (known to the teacher, but not the learner) for which sgn(h∗(x)) = y(x) for all x ∈ X . The goal of the teacher is to teach the correct hypothesis h∗ to the learner. The basic assumption behind our approach is that if\nwe can teach the workers to classify X correctly, then they will be able to generalize to new examples drawn from the same distribution as X (for which we neither have ground truth labels nor features). We will verify this assumption experimentally in Section 6. In the following, we review existing approaches to teaching classifiers, and then present our novel teaching method."

      "heading" : "2.2. Existing teaching models",
      "text" : "In existing methods, a broad separation can be made about assumptions that learners use to process training examples. Noise-free models assume learners immediately discard hypotheses inconsistent with observed examples. As our experiments in Section 6 show, such models can be brittle in practice. In contrast, noise-tolerant models make less strict assumptions on how workers treat inconsistent hypotheses.\nNoise-free teaching: In their seminal work, Goldman & Kearns (1992) consider the non-interactive model: The teacher reveals a sequence of labeled examples, and the learner discards any inconsistent hypotheses (i.e., for which h(x) 6= y for any example (x, y) shown). For a given hypothesis class, the Teaching Dimension is the smallest number of examples required to ensure that all inconsistent hypotheses are eliminated. More recent work (Balbach & Zeugmann, 2009; Zilles et al., 2011; Doliwa et al., 2010; Du & Ling, 2011) consider models of interactive teaching, where the teacher, after showing each example, obtains feedback about the hypothesis that the learner is currently implementing. Such feedback can be used to select future teaching examples in a more informed way. While theoretically intriguing, in this paper we focus on non-interactive models, which are typically easier to deploy in practice.\nNoise-tolerant teaching: In contrast to the noise-free setting, the practically extremely important noise-tolerant setting is theoretically much less understood. Very recently, Zhu (2013) investigates the optimization problem of generating a set of teaching examples that trades off between the expected future error of the learner and the “effort” (i.e., number of examples) taken by the teacher, in the special case when the prior of the learner falls into the exponential family, and the learner performs Bayesian\ninference. Their algorithmic approach does not apply to the problem addressed in this paper. Further, the approach is based on heuristically rounding the solution of a convex program, with no bounds on the integrality gap.\nBasu & Christensen (2013) study a similar problem of teaching workers to classify images. The authors empirically investigate a variety of heuristic teaching policies on a set of human subjects for a synthetically generated data set. Lindsey et al. (2013) propose a method for evaluating and optimizing over parametrized policies with different orderings of positive and negative examples. None of these approaches offer theoretical performance guarantees of the kind provided in this paper."

      "heading" : "3. Model of the Learner",
      "text" : "We now introduce our model of the learner, by formalizing our assumptions about how she adapts her hypothesis based on the training examples she receives from the teacher. Generally, we assume that the learner is not aware that she is being taught. We assume that she carries out a random walk in the hypothesis spaceH: She starts at some hypothesis, stays there as long as the training examples received are consistent with it, and randomly jumps to an alternative hypothesis upon an observed inconsistency. Hereby, preference will be given to hypotheses that better agree with the received training.\nMore formally, we model the learner via a stochastic process, in particular a (non-stationary) Markov chain. Before the first example, the learner randomly chooses a hypothesis h1, drawn from a prior distribution P0. Then, in every round t there are two possibilities: If the example (xt, yt) received agrees with the label implied by the learner’s current hypothesis (i.e., sgn(ht(xt)) = yt), she sticks to it: ht+1 = ht. On the other hand, if the label yt disagrees with the learner’s prediction sgn(ht(xt)), she draws a new hypothesis ht+1 based on a distribution Pt constructed in a way that reduces the probability of hypotheses that disagreed with the true labels in the previous steps:\nPt(h) = 1\nZt P0(h)\nt∏ s=1\nys 6=sgn(h(xs))\nP (ys|h, xs) (1)\nwith normalization factor\nZt = ∑ h∈H P0(h)\nt∏ s=1\nys 6=sgn(h(xs))\nP (ys|h, xs).\nIn Equation (1), for some α > 0, the term\nP (ys|h, xs) = 1\n1 + exp(−αh(xs)ys)\nmodels a likelihood function, encoding the confidence that hypothesis h places in example xs. Thus, if the example (xs, ys) is “strongly inconsistent” with h (i.e., h(xs)ys takes a large negative value and consequently P (ys | h, xs) is very small), then the learner will be very unlikely to jump to hypothesis h. The scaling parameter α allows to control the effect of observing inconsistent examples. The limit α→∞ results in a behavior where inconsistent hypotheses are completely removed from consideration. This case precisely coincides with the noise-free learner models classically considered in the literature (Goldman & Kearns, 1992).\nIt can be shown (see Lemma 1 in the supplementary material), that the marginal probability that the learner implements some hypothesis h in step t is equal to Pt(h), even when the true label and the predicted label agreed in the previous step."

      "text" : "Given the learner’s prior over the hypotheses P0(h), how should the teacher choose examples to help the learner narrow down her belief to accurate hypotheses? By carefully showing examples, the teacher can control the learner’s progress by steering her posterior towards h∗.\nWith a slight abuse of notation, if the teacher showed the set of examples A = {x1, . . . , xt} we denote the posterior distribution by Pt(·) and P (·|A) interchangeably. We use the latter notation when we want to emphasize that the examples shown are the elements ofA. With the new notation, we can write the learner’s posterior after showingA as\nP (h|A) = 1 Z(A) P0(h) ∏ x∈A\ny(x) 6=sgn(h(x))\nP (y(x)|h, x) .\nThe ultimate goal of the teacher is to steer the learner towards a distribution with which she makes few mistakes. The expected error-rate of the learner after seeing examples A = {x1, . . . , xt} together with their labels yi = sgn(h ∗(xi)) can be expressed as\nE[errL | A] = ∑ h∈H P (h|A) err(h, h∗) ,where\nerr(h, h∗) = |{x ∈ X : sgn(h(x)) 6= sgn(h∗(x))}|\n|X |\nis the fraction of examples x from the teaching set X on whichh andh∗ disagree about the label. We use the notation E[errL] = E[errL | {}] as shorthand to refer to the learner’s error before receiving training.\nGiven an allowed tolerance for the learner’s error, a natural objective for the teacher is to find the smallest set of examplesA∗ achieving this error, i.e.:\nA∗ε = arg min A⊆X |A| s.t. E[errL | A] ≤ . (2)\nWe will use the notation OPT( ) = |A∗ | to refer to the size of the optimal solution achieving error . Unfortunately, Problem (2) is a difficult combinatorial optimization problem. The following proposition, proved in the supplement, establishes hardness via a reduction from set cover.\nProposition 1. Problem (2) is NP-hard.\nGiven this hardness, in the following, we introduce an efficient approximation algorithm for Problem (2).\nThe first observation is that, in order to solve Problem (2), we can look at the objective function\nR(A) = E[errL]− E[errL | A] = ∑ h∈H (P0(h)− P (h|A)) err(h, h∗) ,\nquantifying the expected reduction in error upon teaching A. Solving Problem (2) is equivalent to finding the smallest set A achieving error reduction E[errL] − . Thus, if we could, for each k, find a set A of size k maximizing R(A), we could solve Problem (2), contradicting the hardness.\nThe key idea is to replace the objective R(A) with the following surrogate function:\nF (A) = ∑ h∈H (Q(h)−Q(h|A)) err(h, h∗) ,where\nQ(h|A) = P0(h) ∏ x∈A\ny(x) 6=sgn(h(x))\nP (y(x)|h, x)\nis the unnormalized posterior of the learner. As shown in the supplementary material, this surrogate objective function satisfies submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition. Submodular functions can be effectively optimized using a greedy algorithm, which, at every iteration, adds the example that maximally increases the surrogate function F (Nemhauser et al., 1978). We will show that maximizing F (A) gives us good results in terms of the original, normalized objective functionR(A), that is, the expected error reduction of the learner. In fact, we show that running the algorithm untilF (A) ≥ E[errL]−P0(h∗) is sufficient to produce a feasible solution to Problem (2), providing a natural stopping condition. We call the greedy algorithm for F (A) STRICT, and describe it in Policy 1.\nNote that in the limit α → ∞, F (A) quantifies the prior mass of all hypotheses h (weighted by err(h, h∗)) that are inconsistent with the examplesA. Thus, in this case,F (A) is simply a weighted coverage function, consistent with classical work in noise-free teaching (Goldman & Kearns, 1992)."

Now we show that, under some additional assumptions, the optimal number of examples is not too large.\nWe consider the important case where the set of hypotheses H = {h1, h2, . . . , hn} consists of linear separators h(x) = wTh x+ bh for some weight vectorwh ∈ Rd and offset bh ∈ R. The label predicted byh for examplex is sgn(wTh x+bh).\nWe introduce an additional assumption, namely λ-richness of (X ,H). First notice that H partitions X into polytopes (intersections of half-spaces), where within one polytope, all examples are labeled the same by every hypothesis, that is, within a polytope P , for every x, x′ ∈ P ⊆ Rd and h ∈ H, sgn(h(x)) = sgn(h(x′)). We say that X is λ-rich if any P contains at least λ examples. In other words, if the teacher needs to show (up to) λ distinct examples to the learner from the same polytope in order to reduce her error below some level, this can be done.\nTheorem 2. Fix ε > 0.

Our teaching process requires a known feature space for image dataset X (i.e. the teaching set of images) and a hypothesis class H.

As a crucial advantage, in this setting the hypothesis classH is known by design, and the task difficulty can be controlled. Furthermore, this setting ensures that workers have no prior knowledge of the image categories.\nDataset X and feature space: We generated synthetic images of insects belonging to two hypothetical species: Weevil and Vespula. The task is to classify whether a given image contains a Vespula or not. The images were generated by varying body size and color as well as head size and color. A given image xi can be distinguished based on the following two-dimensional feature vector xi = [xi,1 = f1, xi,2 = f2] – i) f1: the head/body size ratio, ii) f2: head/body color contrast. Fig. 3(a) shows the embedding of this data set in a twodimensional space based on these two features. Fig. 2 shows sample images of the two species and illustrates that Weevils have short heads with color similar to their body, whereas Vespula are distinguished by their big and contrasting heads.\nA total of 80 images per species were generated by sampling the features f1 and f2 from two bivariate Gaussian distributions: (µ = [0.10, 0.13], Σ = [0.12, 0; 0, 0.12]) for Vespula and (µ = [−0.10,−0.13], Σ = [0.12, 0; 0, 0.12]) for Weevil. A separate test set of 20 images per species were generated as well, for evaluating learning performance.\nHypothesis classH: Since we know the exact feature space of X , we can use any parametrized class of functionsH on X . In our experiments, we use a class of linear functions for H , and further restrictingH to eight clusters of hypotheses, centered at the origin and rotated by π/4 from each other. Specifically, we sampled the parameters of the linear hypotheses from the following multivariate Gaussian distribution: (µi = [π/4 · i, 0], Σi = [2, 0; 0, 0.005]), where i varies from 0 to 7. Each hypothesis captures a different set of cues about the features that workers could reasonably have: i) ignoring a feature, ii) using it as a positive signal for Vespula, and iii) using it as a negative signal for Vespula. Amongst the generated hypothesis, we picked target hypothesis h∗ as the one with minimal error on teaching setX . In order to ensure realizability, we then removed any data points x ∈ X where sgn(h∗(x)) 6= y(x).

The task is to classify whether a given image contains a butterfly or not. While Peacock Butterfly and Caterpillar Moth are clearly distinguishable as butterflies and moths, Tiger Moth and Ringlet Butterfly are visually hard to classify correctly. We used 160 of these images (40 per sub-species) as teaching setX and the remaining 40 (10 per sub-species) for testing.\nCrowd-embedding of X : A Euclidean embedding of X for such an image set is not readily available. Humanperceptible features for such real images may be difficult to compute. In fact, this challenge is one major motivation for using crowdsourcing in image annotation. However, several techniques do exist that allow estimating such an embedding from a small set of images and a limited number of crowd labels. In particular, we used the approach of Welinder et al.\n2Imagenet: http://www.image-net.org/\n(2010) as a preprocessing step. Welinder et al. propose a generative Bayesian model for the annotation process of the images by the workers and then use an inference algorithm to jointly estimate a low-dimensional embedding of the data, as well as a collection of linear hypotheses – one for each annotator – that best explain their provided labels.\nWe requested binary labels (of whether the image contains a butterfly) for our teaching set X , |X | = 160, from a set of 60 workers. By using the software CUBAM3, implementing the approach of Welinder et al., we inferred a 2-D embedding of the data, as well as linear hypotheses corresponding to each of the 60 workers who provided the labels. Fig. 3(b) shows this embedding of the data, as well as a small subset of workers’ hypotheses as colored lines.\nHypothesis class H: The 60 hypothesis obtained through the crowd-embedding provide a prior distribution over linear hypotheses that the workers in the crowd may have been using. Note that these hypotheses capture various idiosyncrasies (termed “schools of thought” by Welinder et al.) in the workers’ annotation behavior – i.e., some workers were more likely to classify certain moths as butterflies and vice versa. To create our hypothesis classH, we randomly sampled 15 hypotheses from these. Additionally, we fitted a linear classifier that best separates the classes and used it as target hypothesis h∗, shown in red in Fig. 3(b). The few examples in X that disagreed with h∗ were removed from our teaching set, to ensure realizability.\nTeaching the rest of the crowd: The teacher then uses this embedding and hypotheses in order to teach the rest of the crowd.

We used a collection of 150 real images belonging to three species of woodpeckers from a publicly available dataset (Wah et al., 2011), with one endangered species: i) Red-cockaded woodpecker and other two species belonging to the least-concerned category: ii) Red-bellied woodpecker, iii) Downy woodpecker. On this dataset, the task is to classify whether a given image contains a red-cockaded woodpecker or not. We used 80 of these images (40 per red-cockaded, and 20 each per the other two species of least-concerned category) for teaching (i.e., dataset X ). We also created a testing set of 20 images (10 for red-cockaded, and 5 each for the other two species).\nCrowd-embedding of X : We need to infer an embedding and hypothesis space of the teaching set for our teaching process. While an approach similar to the one used for the BM task is applicable here as well, we considered an alternate option of using metadata associated with these images, elicited from the crowd, as further explained below.\nEach image in this dataset is annotated with 312 binary attributes, for example, has forehead color:black, or has bill length:same as head, through workers on MTurk. The features can take values {+1, -1, 0} indicating the presence or absence of an attribute, or uncertainty (when the annotator is not sure or the answer cannot be inferred from the image given). Hence, this gives us an embedding of the data in R312. To further reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, we pruned the features which are not informative enough for the woodpecker species. We considered all the species of woodpeckers present in the dataset (total of 6), simply computed the average number of times a given species is associated positively with a feature,\nand then looked for features with maximal variance among the various species. By applying a simple cutoff of 60 on the variance, we picked the top d = 13 features as shown in Fig 3(c), also listing the average number of times the feature is associated positively with the three species.\nHypothesis class H: We considered a simple set of linear hypotheses h(x) = wTx for w ∈ {+1, 0,−1}d, which place a weight of {+1, 0, -1} on any given feature and passing through the origin. The intuition behind these simple hypotheses is to capture the cues that workers could possibly use or learn for different features: ignoring a feature (0), using it as a positive signal (+1), and using it as a negative signal (−1). Another set of simple hypotheses that we explored are conjunctions and disjunctions of these features that can be created by setting the appropriate offset factor bh (Anthony et al., 1992). Assuming that workers focus only on a small set of features, we considered sparse hypotheses with non-zero weight on only a small set of features. To obtain the target hypothesis, we enumerated all possible hypotheses that have non-zero weight for at most three features. We then picked as h∗ the hypothesis with minimal error on X (shown in Fig 3(c)). Again, we pruned the few examples inX which disagreed withh∗ to ensure realizability. As hypothesis class H, we considered all hypotheses with a non-zero weight for at most two features along with the target h∗, resulting in a hypothesis class of size 339.\nTeaching the rest of the crowd: Given this embedding and hypothesis class, the teacher then uses the same approach as two previous datasets to teach the rest of the crowd.

We simulated 100 learners with varying α parameters chosen randomly from the set {2, 3, 4} and different initial hypotheses of the learners, sampled fromH.

SetCover starts with difficult examples assuming that the learner is perfect. STRICT starts with easy examples, followed by more difficult ones, as also illustrated in the experiments in Fig. 5(a). Recent results of Basu & Christensen (2013) show that such curriculum-based learning (where the difficulty level of teaching increases with time) indeed is a useful teaching mechanism. Note that our teaching process inherently incorporates this behavior, without requiring explicit heuristic choices. Also, the transition of SetCover to easier examples is just an artifact as SetCover\nrandomly starts selecting examples once it (incorrectly) infers that the learner has adopted the target hypothesis. The difficulty can be easily seen when comparing the examples picked by SetCover and STRICT in Fig. 5(a)."

We further show these examples in the 2-D embedding for the VW and BM datasets in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b).\nWorkers on MTurk and the teaching task. We recruited workers from the MTurk platform by posting the tasks on the MTurk platform. Workers were split into different control groups, depending on the algorithm and the length of teaching used (each control group corresponds to a point in the plots of Fig. 5). Fig. 1 provides a high level overview of how the teaching algorithm interacted with the worker. Teaching is followed by a phase of testing examples without providing feedback, for which we report the classification error. For the VW dataset, a total of 780 workers participated (60 workers per control group). For BM, a total of 300 workers participated, and 520 participated in the WP task. The length of the teaching phase was varied as shown in Fig. 5. The test phase was set to 10 examples for the VW and BM tasks, and 16 examples for the WP task. The workers were\ngiven a fixed payment for participation and completion, additionally a bonus payment was reserved for the top 10% performing workers within each control group. Does teaching help? Considering the worker’s test set classification performance in Fig. 5, we can consistently see an accuracy improvement as workers classify unseen images. This aligns with the results from simulated learners and shows that teaching is indeed helpful in practice. Furthermore, the improvement is monotonic w.r.t. the length of teaching phase used by STRICT. In order to understand the significance of these results, we carried out Welch’s t-test comparing the workers who received teaching by STRICT to the control group of workers without any teaching. The hypothesis that STRICT significantly improves the classification accuracy has two-tailed p-values of p < 0.001 for VW and WP tasks, and p = 0.01 for the BM task.\nDoes our teaching algorithm outperform baselines? Fig. 5 demonstrates that our algorithm STRICT outperforms both Random and SetCover teaching qualitatively in all studies. We check the significance by performing a paired-t test, by computing the average performance of the workers in a given control group and pairing the control groups with same length of teaching for a given task. For the VW task, STRICT is significantly better than SetCover and Random (at p = 0.05 and p = 0.05). For WP, STRICT is significantly better than SetCover (p = 0.002) whereas comparing with Random, the p-value is p = 0.07."

      "text" : "We proposed a noise-tolerant stochastic model of the workers’ learning process in crowdsourcing classification tasks. We then developed a novel teaching algorithm STRICT\nthat exploits this model to teach the workers efficiently. Our model generalizes existing models of teaching in order to increase robustness. We proved strong theoretical approximation guarantees on the convergence to a desired error rate. Our extensive experiments on simulated workers as well as on three real annotation tasks on the Mechanical Turk platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our teaching approach.\nMore generally, our approach goes beyond solving the problem of teaching workers in crowdsourcing services. With the recent growth of online education and tutoring systems 4, algorithms such as STRICT can be envisioned to aid in supporting data-driven online education (Weld et al., 2012; Dow et al., 2013)."

      "text" : "A.1. Proofs\nProof of Proposition 1. We reduce from set cover. Suppose we are given a collection of finite sets S1, . . . , Sn jointly covering a set W . We reduce the problem of finding a smallest subcollection covering W to the teaching problem with the special case α =∞.\nLetH = W ∪ {h∗}, that is, each element in W is a hypothesis that misclassifies at least one data point. We use a uniform prior p(h) = 1|W |+1 . For each set Sj , we create a teaching example xj . The label output by hypothesis h(xj) = 1 iff h ∈ Sj , otherwise h(xj) = −1. We set h∗(x) = −1 for all examples. Thus, selecting Si in the set cover problem is equivalent to selecting example xi. It is easy to see that constructing the examples can be done in polynomial (in fact, linear) time.\nThe expected error after showing a set of examples is less than 1(|W |+1)n if and only if sets indexed by A cover W . Thus, if we could efficiently find the smallest setA achieving error less than 1(|W |+1)n , we could efficiently solve set cover.\nBefore proving the main theorems, we state an important lemma that will be needed throughout the analysis.\nLemma 1. Assume that the learner’s current hypothesis ht is governed by the stochastic process described in Section 3. Then, the marginal distribution of ht is given by Pt−1(h) in every time step t.\nProof. Let the marginal distribution of ht denoted by P ′t−1(h). We will show by induction that for every t, P ′ t = Pt.\nObviously, P ′0 = P0 by definition. Now, as for the induction hypothesis, let us assume that P ′ t−1 = Pt−1. By the definition of the stochastic process we have\nP ′t (h) = 1\nZ ′t\n( P ′t−1(h)I{yt = h(xt)|h, xt}+ Pt(h)I{yt 6= h(xt)|h, xt} ) = 1\nZ ′t (Pt−1(h)I{yt = h(xt)|h, xt}+ Pt−1(h)P (yt|h, xt)I{yt 6= h(xt)|h, xt})\n= 1\nZ ′t Pt−1(h) (I{yt = h(xt)|h, xt}+ P (yt|h, xt)I{yt 6= h(xt)|h, xt})\n= 1\nZ ′t Pt−1(h)P (yt|h, xt)I{yt 6=h(xt)|h,xt} = Pt(h) ,\nas stated.\nProof of Theorem 1. Clearly, F (A) can be written as\nF (A) = ∑ h∈H P0(h)Gh(A) err(h, h ∗) ,\nwhere\nGh(A) = 1− ∏ x∈A\ny(x) 6=sgn(h(x))\nP (y(x)|h, x) .\nIt is easy to see thatGh(A) is submodular for every h ∈ H. Thus, F (A) is also submodular.\nLet us start to upper bound the expected error of the learner. For that, we need the following simple observation:\nP (h|A) P (h∗|A) = Q(h|A) Q(h∗|A) = Q(h|A) P0(h∗) .\nNow for the upper bounding: ∑ h∈H P (h|A) err(h, h∗) ≤ ∑ h∈H P (h|A) P (h∗|A) err(h, h∗)\n= 1\nP0(h∗) ∑ h∈H Q(h|A) err(h, h∗)\n= 1\nP0(h∗) (E − F (A)) ,\nwhere E = ∑ h∈H P0(h) err(h, h\n∗) is an upper bound on the maximum of F (A). This means that if we choose a subset A such that F (A) ≥ E − P0(h∗) , it guarantees an expected error less than . In the following, we assume that F (X ) ≥ E − P0(h∗) /2. If this assumption is violated, the Theorem still holds, but the bound is meaningless, since OPT(P0(h ∗) /2) =∞ in this case.\nSince F (A) is submodular (and monotonic), we can achieve E − P0(h∗) “level” with the greedy algorithm, as described below. We use the following result of the greedy algorithm for maximizing submodular functions:\nTheorem (Krause & Golovin (2014), based on Nemhauser et al. (1978)). Let f be a nonnegative monotone submodular function and let St denote the set chosen by the greedy maximization algorithm after t steps. Then we have\nf(S`) ≥ ( 1− e−`/k )\nmax S:|S|=k f(S)\nfor all integers k and l.\nLet k∗ be the cardinality of the smallest setA∗ such that F (A∗) ≥ E − P0(h∗) /2. Thus we know that\nmax A:|A|=k∗\nF (A) ≥ E − P0(h∗) /2 .\nNow we set ` = k∗ log 2EP0(h∗) and we denoteA` the result of the greedy algorithm after ` steps, and we get\nF (A`) ≥ ( 1− e−l/k ∗ )( E − P0(h ∗)\n2 ) = ( 1− P0(h ∗)\n2E\n)( E − P0(h ∗)\n2 ) ≥ E − p(h∗) ,\nproving that running the greedy algorithm for ` steps achieves the desired result.\nProof of Theorem 2. We introduce a randomized teaching policy called Relaxed-Greedy Teaching Policy (sketched in Policy 2) and prove that with positive probability, the policy reduces the learner error exponentially. Then, we use the standard probabilistic argument: positive probability of the above event implies that there must exist a sequence of examples that reduce the learner error exponentially. We finish the proof of the theorem by using the result of Theorem 1.\nBased on our model, the way the learner updates his/her belief after showing example xt ∈ X and receiving answer yt = sgn(h ∗(xt)) is as follows:\nPt+1(h) = 1\nZt Pt(h)w\n(1−ξt(h))/2 l ,\nwhere ξt(h) = sgn(h(xt)) · yt, the term Zt is the normalization factor, and 0 < wl < 1 is a parameter by which the learner decreases the weight of inconsistent hypotheses. Note thatwl may very well depend on the examples shown, i.e., for hard exampleswl is typically larger than those of the easy ones as the learner is more certain about his/her answers. However, here we assume thatwl ≤ wo < 1 and thatwo is known to the teacher. In other words, the teacher knows the minimum weight updates imposed by the learner on inconsistent hypotheses. As a result, the teacher can track Pt+1(h) conservatively as follows:\nP (t) t+1(h) =\n1\nZt P\n(t) t (h)w (1−ξt(h))/2 o .

Let H be a collection of n linear separators and choose an 0 < < 1. Then, under the condition that X is m-rich, RGTP guarantees to achieve\nPr(1− Pm(h∗) > ) < (1− )(1− p0(h∗))\n· p0(h∗) e−m(1−wo)/4,\nby showing m examples in total. In other words, to have Pr(1 − Pm(h∗) > ) < δ, RGTP uses at most the following number of examples:\nm = 4\n1− wo log (1− )(1− p0(h∗)) δ · · p0(h∗) .\nThe above theorem requires that X gets a richer space for obtaining better performance. When we have a uniform prior P0 = 1/n, the the above bounds simplify to\nm = 4\n1− wo log (1− )n δ · .\nAs at least log n queries is required to identify the correct hypothesis with probability one, the above bound is within a constant factor from log n for fixed and δ.\nThe proof technique is inspired by (Burnashev & Zigangirov, 1974), (Karp & Kleinberg, 2007), and in particular beautiful insights in (Nowak, 2011). To analyze RGTP let us define the random variable\nη (l) t = 1− Pt(h∗) Pt(h∗) .\nThis random variable log(ηt) was first introduced by (Burnashev & Zigangirov, 1974) in order to analyze the classic binary search under noisy observations (for the ease of exposure we use ηt instead of log(ηt)). It basically captures the probability mass put on the incorrect hypothesis after t examples. Similarly, we can define\nη (t) t = 1− P (t)t (h∗) p\n(t) t (h\n∗) .\nA simple fact to observe is the following lemma.\nLemma 2. For any sequence of examples/labels {(xt, yt)}t≥0, and as long as 0 ≤ wl ≤ wo ≤ 1 we have η(l)t ≤ η (t) t .\nNote that RGTP is a randomized algorithm. Using Markov’s inequality we obtain\nPr(1− Pm(h∗)) > ) ≤ Pr(1− P (t)h∗ (h)) > )\n= Pr ( ηt >\n1− ) ≤ (1− )E(η (t) t ) .\nThe above inequalities simply relates the probability we are looking for in Theorem 2 to the expected value of η(t)t . Hence, if we can show that the expected value decreases exponentially fast, we are done. To this end, let us first state the following observation.\nLemma 3. For any sequence of examples/labels {(xt, yt)}t≥0, and for 0 ≤ wo < 1 the corresponding random variable {η(t)t }t≥0 are all non-negative and decreasing, i.e.,\n0 ≤ η(t)s ≤ η (t) t ≤ 1− P0(h∗) P0(h∗) , s ≥ t.\nThe above lemma simply implies that the sequence {ηt}t≥0 converges. However, it does not indicate the rate of convergence. Let us define Ft = σ(P (t)0 , p (t) 1 , . . . , p (t) t ) the sigma-field generated by random variables P (t) 0 , p (t) 1 , . . . , p (t) t . Note that η (t) t is a function of p(t)t thusFt-measurable. Now, by using the towering property of the expectation we obtain\nE(η(t)t ) = E((η (t) t /η (t) t−1)η (t) t−1) = E(E((η (t) t /η (t) t−1)η (t) t−1|Ft−1))\nSince η(t)t−1 isFt−1-measurable we get\nE(η(t)t ) = E(η (t) t−1E((η (t) t /η (t) t−1)|Ft−1))\n≤ E(η(t)t−1) maxFt−1 E((η(t)t /η (t) t−1)|Ft−1).\nThe above inequality simply implies that\nE(η(t)t ) = 1− P0(h∗) P0(h∗)\n( max\n0≤s≤t−1 max Fs\nE((η(t)s+1/η (t) s )|Fs)\n)t (4)\nIn the remaining of the proof we derive a uniform upper bound (away from 1) onE((η(t)t /η (t) t−1)|Ft−1), which readily implies exponential decay on Pr(1− Pm(h∗) > ) as the number of samplesm grows. For the ease of presentation, let us define the (weighted) proportion of hypothesis that agree with yt as follows:\nδt = 1\n2\n( 1 +\n∑ h P (t) t (h)ξi(h)\n) .\nAlong the same line, we define the proportion of hypothesis that predict + on polytopeP as follows\nδ+P = 1\n2\n( 1 +\n∑ h P (t) t (h)h(P)\n) .\nNow, we can easily relate δt to the normalization factorZt:\nZt = ∑ h P (t) t (h)w (1−ξi(h))/2 o = (1− δt)wo + δt.\nAs a result\nP (t) t+1(h) =\nPt(h)w (1−ξi(h))/2 o\n(1− δt)wo + δt .\nIn particular for P (t)t+1(h ∗) we have\nP (t) t+1(h\n∗) = Pt(h)\n(1− δt)wo + δt .\nTo simplify the notation, we define γt = (1− δt)wo + δt.\nHence,\nη (t) t+1 η (t) s = γt − P (t)t (h∗) 1− P (t)t (h∗) .\nNote that since P (t)t (h ∗) isFt-measurable the above equality entails that\nE\n( η\n(t) t+1 η (t) t |Ft\n) =\nE(γt|Ft)− P (t)t (h∗) 1− P (t)t (h∗) .\nThus we need to show that E(γt|Ft) is bounded away from 1. To this end, we borrow the following geometric lemma from (Nowak, 2011).\nLemma 4. LetH consists of a set of linear separators where each induced polytope P ∈ Π contains at least one example x ∈ X . Then for any probability distribution p onH one of the following situations happens\n1. either there exists a polytopeP such that ∑ h p(h)h(P) = 0, or 2. there exists a pair of neighboring polytopesP andP ′ such that ∑ h p(h)h(P) > 0 and ∑ h p(h)h(P ′) < 0.\nThe above lemma essentially characterizes Ham Sandwich Theorem (Lo et al., 1994) in discrete domain X that is 1-rich. In words, Lemma 4 guarantees that either there exists a polytope where (weighted) hypothesis greatly disagree, or there are two neighboring polytopes that are bipolar. In either case, if an example is shown randomly from these polytopes, it will be very informative. This is essentially the reason why RGTP performs well.\nNow, letPt be the polytope from which the example xt is shown. Then, based on yt we have two cases:\n• if yt = + then γ+t . = γt = (1− δ+Pt)wo + δ + Pt , • if yt = − then γ−t . = γt = δ + Ptwo + 1− δ + Pt .\nNote that for any xt picked by RGTP we have 0 < δ+Pt < 1, since it never shows an example that all hypothesis agree on. As a result, both γ+t and γ − t are between 0 and 1.\nBased on Lemma 4 there are only two cases. Let us define the auxiliary random variable st that simply indicate in which case we are. More precisely, st = 1 indicates that we are in case 1 and st = 2 indicates that we are in case 2. To be formal we define Gt = σ(P (t)0 , p (t) 1 , . . . , p (t) t , st). Note that Ft ⊂ Gt and thus E(γt|Ft) = E(E(γt|Gt)|Ft). We need to prove the following technical lemma.\nLemma 5.\nE(γt|Gt)\n≤ max\n{ 3 + wo\n4 , 1 + wo 2\n, 1− (1− wo)(1− P (t) t (h ∗))\n2\n} .\nProof. Let us first condition on st = 1. Then, RGTP chooses an xt ∈ Pt in which case δ+Pt = 1/2 and results in γ+t = γ − t = (wo + 1)/2. Hence, given st = 1, we have\nE(γt|Gt) = (wo + 1)/2. (5)\nThe conditioning on st = 2 is a little bit more elaborate. Recall that in this case RGTP randomly chooses one of P and P ′. Note that δ+P > 1/2 and δ + P′ < 1/2. Now we encounter 4 possibilities:\n1. h∗(P) = h∗(P ′) = +: condition on st = 2 we have\nE(γt|Gt) = γ+t + γ − t\n2\n≤ 1 + (1− δ+P′)wo + δ + P′\n2\n≤ 3 + wo 4\n(6)\nwhere we used the fact that γ+t ≤ 1 and (1− δ+P′)wo + δ + P′ is an increasing function of δ + P′ and that δ + P′ < 1/2.\n2. h∗(P) = h∗(P ′) = −: similar argument as above shows that\nE(γt|Gt) ≤ 3 + wo\n4 .\n3. h∗(P) = −, h∗(P ′) = +: In this case we have\nE(γt|Gt) = γ+t + γ − t\n2\n= δ+Pwo + 1− δ + P + (1− δ + P′)wo + δ + P′\n2\n= 1− 1− wo 2 (1 + δ+P − δ + P′) ≤ 1 + wo 2\n(7)\nwhere we used the fact 0 ≤ δ+P − δ + P′ ≤ 1.\n4. h∗(P) = +, h∗(P ′) = −: since P and P ′ are neighboring polytopes, h∗ should be the common face. Hence, we have δ+P − δ + P′ = P (t) t (h ∗). As a result\nE(γt|Gt) = γ+t + γ − t\n2\n= (1− δ+P )wo + δ + P + δ + P′wo + 1− δ + P′\n2\n= 1 + δ+P − δ + P′ + wo(1− δ + P + δ + P′)\n2\n≤ 1− (1− wo)(1− P (t) t (h ∗))\n2 . (8)\nBy combining (6), (7) and (8) we prove the lemma.\nLemma 5 readily implies that\nE\n( η\n(t) t+1 η (t) t |Ft\n) =\nE(γt|Ft)− P (t)t (h∗) 1− P (t)t (h∗)\n≤ 3 + wo 4 .\nHence,\nE(η(t)t ) = 1− P0(h∗) P0(h∗)\n( 1− 1− wo\n4 )t ≤ 1− P0(h ∗)\nP0(h∗) exp(−t · (1− wo)/4)\nThis finishes the proof of Theorem 3. Now, to finish the proof of Theorem 2, we just set δ to 1/2 and use the probabilistic argument mentioned in the beginning of the proof, resulting in an upper bound on OPT. Since we use the logistic likelihood function,wo can be bounded by 12 . Theorem 1 follows."

Noise-tolerant teaching: In contrast to the noise-free setting, the practically extremely important noise-tolerant setting is theoretically much less understood.

This is a natural problem when training workers for crowdsourcing labeling tasks, and is also motivated by challenges in data-driven online education. We propose a natural stochastic model of the learners, modeling them as randomly switching among hypotheses based on observed feedback. We then develop STRICT, an efficient algorithm for selecting examples to teach to workers. Our solution greedily maximizes a submodular surrogate objective function in order to select examples to show to the learners. We prove that our strategy is competitive with the optimal teaching policy. Moreover, for the special case of linear separators, we prove that an exponential reduction in error probability can be achieved. Our experiments on simulated workers as well as three real image annotation tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk show the effectiveness of our teaching algorithm.",
