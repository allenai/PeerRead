Danforth,1 and Peter Sheridan Dodds1\n1Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Vermont Complex Systems Center, Computational Story Lab, & the Vermont Advanced Computing Core,\nThe University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05401 2School of Mathematical Sciences, The University of Adelaide, SA 5005 Australia\n(Dated: June 27, 2016)\nAdvances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of text now make it possible to study our a culture’s evolution through its texts using a “big data” lens. Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg’s fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe power of stories to transfer information and define our own existence has been shown time and again [1– 5]. We are fundamentally driven to find and tell stories, likened to Pan Narrans or Homo Narrativus. Stories are encoded in art, language, and even in the mathematics of physics: We use equations to represent both simple and complicated functions that describe our observations of the real world. In science, we formalize the ideas that best fit our experience with principles such as Occam’s Razor: The simplest story is the one we should trust. We also tend to prefer stories that fit into the molds which are familiar, and reject narratives that do not align with our experience [6].\nWe seek to better understand stories that are captured and shared in written form, a medium that since inception has radically changed how information flows [7]. Without evolved cues from tone, facial expression, or body language, written stories are forced to capture the entire transfer of experience on a page. A often integral part of a written story is the emotional experience that is evoked in the reader. Here, we use a simple, robust sentiment analysis tool to extract the reader-perceived emotional content of written stories as they unfold on the page.\nWe objectively test the theories of folkloristics [8, 9], specifically the commonality of core stories within societal boundaries [4, 10]. A major component of folkloristics is the study of society and culture through literary analysis. This is sometimes referred to as narratology, which at its core is “a series of events, real or fictional, presented to the reader or the listener”, who further define narrative and plot [11]. In our present treatment, we consider the plot as the “backbone” of events that occur in a chronological sequence. We first find an analogous definition in Aristotle’s theory of the three act plot structure: A central conflict emerges in act one, followed by two major turning points in acts two and three\nbefore concluding with a final resolution. While the plot captures the mechanics of a narrative and the structure encodes their delivery, in the present work we examine the emotional arc that is invoked through the words used. The emotional arc of a story does not give us direct information about the plot or the intended meaning of the story, but rather exists as part of the whole narrative. Through the identification of motifs [12], narrative theories [13] allow us to analyze, interpret, describe, and compare stories across cultures and regions of the world [14]. We show that automated extraction of emotional arcs is not only possibly, but can test previous theories and provide new insights with the potential to quantify unobserved trends as the field transitions from data-scarce to data-rich [15, 16].\nThere have been various attempts to enumerate and classify the core types of stories from their plots, including models that generalize broad categories and detailed classification systems. We consider a range of these theories in turn while noting that plot similarities do not necessitate a concordance of emotional arcs.\n• Three plots: In his 1959 book, Foster-Harris contends that there are three basic patterns of plot (extending from the one central pattern of conflict): the happy ending, the unhappy ending, and the tragedy [17]. In these three versions, the outcome of the story hinges on the nature and fortune of a central character: virtuous, selfish, or struck by fate, respectively.\n• Seven plots: Often espoused as early as elementary school in the United States, we have the notion that plots revolve around the conflict of an individual with either (1) him or herself, (2) nature, (3) another individual, (4) the environment, (5) technology, (6) the supernatural, or (7) a higher power [18].\n• Seven plots: Representing over three decades of\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n07 77\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 Ju\nn 20\n16\n2 work, Christopher Booker’s The Seven Basic Plots: Why we tell stories describes in great detail seven narrative structures: [19]\n– Overcoming the monster (e.g., Beowulf ).\n– Rags to riches (e.g., Cinderella).\n– The quest (e.g., King Solomons Mines).\n– Voyage and return (e.g., The Time Machine).\n– Comedy (e.g., A Midsummer Night’s Dream).\n– Tragedy (e.g., Anna Karenina).\n– Rebirth (e.g., Beauty and the Beast).\nIn addition to these seven, Booker contends that the unhappy ending of all but the tragedy are also possible.\n• Twenty plots: In 20 Master Plots, Ronald Tobias proposes plots that include “quest”, “underdog”, “metamorphosis”, “ascension”, and “descension” [20].\n• Thirty-six plots: In a translation by Lucille Ray, Georges Polti attempts to reconstruct the 36 plots that he posits Gozzi originally enumerated [21]. These are quite specific and include “rivalry of kinsmen”, “all sacrificed for passion”, both involuntary and voluntary “crimes of love” (with many more on this theme), “pursuit”, and “falling prey to cruelty of misfortune”.\nThe rejected master’s thesis of Kurt Vonnegut—which he personally considered his greatest contribution— defines the emotional arc of a story on the “Beginning– End” and “Ill Fortune–Great Fortune” axes [22]. Vonnegut finds a remarkable similarity between Cinderella and the origin story of Christianity in the Old Testament (see Fig. S19), leading us to search for all such groupings. In a recorded lecture available on YouTube [23], Vonnegut asserted:\n“There is no reason why the simple shapes of stories can’t be fed into computers, they are beautiful shapes.”\nWe proceed as follows. We first introduce our methods in Section II, we then discuss the combined results of each method in Section III, and we present our conclusions in Section IV.\nII. METHODS\nA. Emotional arc construction\nTo generate emotional arcs, we analyze the sentiment of 10,000 word windows, which we slide through the text (see Fig. 1). We rate the emotional content of each window using our Hedonometer with the labMT dataset,\nUniform length segments of the text\nBase text from Project Gutenberg\nHedonometric analysis\nAverage happiness\n% of text\nsliding window across text\nFIG. 1: Schematic of how we compute emotional arcs. The indicated uniform length segments (gap between samples) taken from the text form the sample with fixed window size set at Nw = 10, 000 words. The segment length is thus Ns = (N−(Nw +1))/n for N the length of the book in words, and n the number of points in the time series. Sliding this fixed size window through the book, we generate n sentiment scores with the Hedonometer, which comprise the emotional arc [26].\nchosen for lexical coverage and its ability to generate of meaningful word shift graphs [24, 25]. In Fig. 2, we show the emotional arc of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final book in the popular Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. While the plot of the book is nested and complicated, the emotional arc associated with each sub-narrative is clearly visible. We analyze the emotional arcs corresponding to complete books, and to limit the conflation of multiple core emotional arcs we restrict our analysis to shorter books (by selecting a maximum number of words when building our filter).\nB. Project Gutenberg Corpus\nFor a suitable corpus we draw on the freely available Project Gutenberg data set [28]. We apply rough filters to the entire collection in an attempt to obtain a set of 1,737 books that represent English works of fiction. Two slices of the data are shown in Fig. S1. We select for only English books, with total words between 10,000 and 200,000, with unique words between 1,000 and 18,000, and with more than 150 downloads from the Project Gutenberg website. Beyond these broad filters, we also remove dictionaries and transcriptions by the Human Genome Project (all three copies of the 24 books). We provide a list of the book ID’s which are\n3\nincluded for download in the online appendices at http: //compstorylab.org/share/papers/reagan2016b/.\nC. Principal Component Analysis (SVD)\nWe use the standard linear algebra technique Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to find a decomposition of stories onto an orthogonal basis of emotional arcs. Starting with the sentiment time series for each book bi as row i in the matrix A, we apply the SVD to find\nA = UΣV T = WV T , (1)\nwhere now U contains the projection of each sentiment time series onto each of the right singular vectors (rows of V T , eigenvectors of ATA), which have singular values given along the diagonal of Σ, with W = UΣ. Different intuitive interpretations of the matrices U,Σ, and V T are useful in the various domains in which the SVD is applied; here, we focus on right singular vectors as an orthonormal basis for the sentiment time series in the rows of A, which we will refer to as the modes. We combine Σ and U into the single coefficient matrix W for clarity and convenience, such that W now represents the mode coefficients.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the leading 12 modes in both the weighted (dark) and un-weighted (lighter) representation. In total, the first 12 modes explain 80% and 94%\nof the variance from the mean centered and raw time series, respectively. The modes are from mean-centered emotional arcs such that the first SVD mode need not extract the average from the labMT scores nor the positivity bias present in language [24]. The coefficients for each mode within a single emotional arc are both positive and negative, so we need to consider both the modes and their negation. We can immediately recognize the familiar shapes of core emotional arcs in the first four modes, and compositions of these emotional arcs in modes 5 and 6. We observe “Rags to riches” (mode 1, positive), “Tragedy” or “Riches to rags” (mode 1, negative), Vonnegut’s “Man in a hole” (mode 2, positive), “Icarus” (mode 2, negative), “Cinderella” (mode 3, positive), “Oedipus” (mode 3, negative). We choose to include modes 7–12 only for completeness, as these high frequency modes have little contribution to variance and do not align with core emotional arc archetypes (more below).\nWe emphasize that by definition of the SVD, the mode coefficients in W can be either positive and negative, such that the modes themselves explain variance with both the positive and negative version. In the right panels of each mode in Fig. 3 we project the 1,737 stories onto each of first six modes and show the resulting coefficients. While none are far from 0 (as would be expected), mode 1 has a mean slightly above 0 and both modes 3 and 4 have means slightly below 0. To sort the books by their coeffi-\ncient for each mode, we normalize the coefficients within each book in the rows of W to sum to 1, accounting for books with higher total energy, and these are the coefficients shown in the right panels of each mode in Fig. 3. In the Appendix, we provide supporting, intuitive details of the SVD method, as well as example emotional arc reconstruction using the modes (see Figs. S3–S5). As expected, less than 10 modes are enough to reconstruct the emotional arc to a degree of accuracy visible to the eye.\nWe show labeled examples of the emotional arcs closest to the top 6 modes in Figs. 4 and S2. We present both the positive and negative modes, and the stories closest to\neach by sorting on the coefficient for that mode. For the positive stories, we sort in ascending order, and vice versa. Mode 1, which encompasses both the “Rags to riches” and “Tragedy” emotional arcs, captures 30% of the variance of the entire space. We examine the closest stories to both sides of modes 1–3, and direct the reader to Fig. S2 for more details on the higher order modes. The two stories that have the most support from the “Rags to riches” mode are Alice’s Adventures Under Ground and Dreams. Among the most categorical tragedies we find A Primary Reader and The House of the Vampire. The top 5 also includes perhaps the most famous tragedy: Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare.

To locate the emotional arcs on the same scale as the modes, we show the modes directly from the rows of V T and weight the emotional arcs by the inverse of their coefficient in W for the particular mode. The closest stories shown for each mode are those stories with emotional arcs which have the greatest coefficient in W . In parenthesis for each story is the Project Gutenberg ID and the number of downloads from the Project Gutenberg website, respectively. Links below each story point to an interactive visualization on http://hedonometer.org which enables detailed exploration of the emotional arc for the story.\nthe “Man in a hole” emotional arc, and we find the stories which most closely follow this path to be Typhoon and Teddy Bears. The negation of mode 2 most closely resembles the emotional arc of the “Icarus” narrative. For this emotional arc, the most characteristic stories are The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and Stories from Hans Andersen. Mode 3 is the “Cinderella” emotional arc, and includes The Consolation of Philosophy and The Scarecrow of Oz. The negation of Mode 3, which we refer to as “Oedipus”, is found most characteristically in The Wonder Book of Bible Stories, The Serpent River, and A Hero of Our Time. We also note that the spread of the stories from their core mode increases strongly for the higher modes.\nIII. RESULTS\nWe obtain a collection of 1,737 books that are mostly, but not all, fictional stories by using metadata from Project Gutenberg to construct a rough filter. Using principal component analysis, we find broad support for six emotional arcs:\n• “Rags to riches” (rise).\n• “Tragedy”, or “Riches to rags” (fall).\n• “Man in a hole” (fall–rise).\n• “Icarus” (rise–fall).\n• “Cinderella” (rise–fall–rise).\n• “Oedipus” (fall–rise–fall).\nImportantly, we also find these emotional arcs using two other methods: As clusters in a hierarchical clustering using Ward’s algorithm and as clusters using unsupervised machine learning.\nWe again find the first four of these six arcs appearing among the eight most different clusters from a hierarchical clustering (Fig. S9). The clustering method groups stories with a “Man in a hole” emotional arc for a range of different variances, separate from the other arcs, in total these clusters (Panels E, F, and G of Fig. S9) account for 23% of the Gutenberg corpus. The remainder of the stories have emotional arcs that are clustered among the “Icarus” arc, “Rags to riches” arc, and the “Tragedy” arc. A detailed analysis of the results from hierarchical clustering can be found in Appendix C.\nFinally, we apply Kohonen’s Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and find these core arcs from unsupervised machine learning on the emotional arcs (Fig. S11 and Appendix D). On the two dimensional component plane, the prescribed network topology, we find three spatially coherent groups. These spatial groups are comprised of stories with core emotional arcs of differing variance. Grouping together the nine most active nodes, we find the “Rags to riches” arc accounts for 19% of the corpus, the “Tragedy” arc with 6%, the “Icarus” arc with 12% across three nodes, and the “Man in a hole” arc with 3% on one node.\nThere are many possible emotional arcs in the space that we consider. To demonstrate that these specific arcs are uniquely compelling as stories written by and for homo narrativus, we compare the emotional arcs of “word salad” versions for each book with randomly permuted word locations. An example of the emotional arc for a single book is shown in Fig. S13, along with 10 word salad versions. We re-run the SVD, hierarchical clustering, and unsupervised machine learning on the Gutenberg Corpus with the word salad version of each book\nand verify that the emotional arcs of real stories are not simply an artifact. The singular value spectrum from the SVD is flatter, with higher-frequency modes appearing more quickly, and in total representing 45% of the total variance present in real stories (see Figs. S15 and S14). Hierarchical clustering generates less distinct clusters with lower linkage cost for the emotional arcs from word salad books, and the winning node vectors on a selforganizing map lack coherent structure (see Figs. S16 and S18).\nTo examine how the emotional trajectory impacts success, in Fig. 5 we examine the downloads for all of the books that are most similar to each SVD mode . We find that the first four modes, which contain the greatest total number of books, are not the most popular. Both polarities of modes 3 and 4 have markedly higher downloads, and somewhat higher variance. The success of the stories underlying these emotional arcs shows that the emotional experience of readers strongly affects how stories are shared. We find the “Icarus” (SV 3), “Oedipus” (-SV 3), two sequential “Man in a hole” arcs (SV 4), and “Cinderella” with a tragic ending (-SV 4) are the most successful emotional arcs.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nUsing three distinct methods, we have demonstrated that there is strong support for six core emotional arcs. Our methodology brings to bear a cross section of data science tools with a knowledge of the potential issues that each present. By considering the results of each tool in support of each other we are able to confirm our findings. We have also shown that consideration of the emotional arc for a given story is important for the success of that story.\nOur approach could applied in the opposite direction: namely by beginning with the emotional arc and aiding in the automatic generation of compelling stories [29]. The emotional arcs of stories may be useful to aid in\n7 constructing arguments [30] and teaching common sense to artificial intelligence systems [31].\nExtensions of our analysis that use a more curated selection of full-text fiction can answer more detailed questions about which stories are the most popular throughout time, and across regions [10]. Automatic extraction of character networks would allow a more detailed analysis of plot structure for the Project Gutenberg corpus used here [11, 32, 33]. Bridging the gap between the full text stories [34] and systems that analyze plot sequences will allow such systems to undertake\nstudies of this scale [35]. Place could also be used to consider separate character networks through time, and to help build an analog to Randall Munroe’s Movie Narrative Charts [36].\nWe are producing data at an ever increasing rate, including rich sources of stories written to entertain and share knowledge, from books to television series to news. Of profound scientific interest will be the degree to which we can eventually understand the full landscape of human stories, and data driven approaches will play a crucial role.\n[1] T.

E, 93:052314, May 2016.\nS1\nAppendix A: Emotional Arc Construction\nTo generate emotional arcs, we consider many different approaches with the goal of generating time series that meaningfully reflect the narrative sentiment. In general, we proceed as described in Fig. 1 and consider a method of breaking up the text as having three (interdependent) parameter choices for a sliding window:\n1. Length of the desired sample text.\n2. Breakpoint between samples.\n3. Overlap of each sample.\nThese methods vary between rating individual words with no overlap to rating the entire text. To make our choice, we consider competing two objectives of time series generation: meaningfulness of sentiment scores and increased temporal resolution of time series. For the most accurate sentiment scores, we can use the entire book. The highest temporal resolution is possible with a sliding window of length 1, generating time series that have potentially as many data points as words in the book.\nSince our goal is not only the generation of time series, but the comparison of time series across texts, we consider the additional objective of consistency. We seek time series which are consistent both in the accuracy of the time series, as well as consistent in the length of the resulting time series. Again these goals are orthogonal, and we note that our choice here can be tuned to test the sensitivity.\nWe normalize the length of emotional arcs for books of different length (while using a fixed window size) by varying the amount that the window needs to move. To make a time series of length l from a book with N words, we fix the sample length at k and set the overlap of samples to\n(N − k − 1)/l\nwords. This guarantees that we have temporal resolution l and sample length k for any N > k+ l. We do not consider books with N ≤ k + l words.\nTo generate a sentiment score as in Fig. 1, we use a dictionary based approach for transparency and understanding of sentiment. We select the LabMT dictionary for robust performance over many corpora and best coverage of word usage [25]. In particular, we determine a sample T ’s average happiness using the equation:\nhavg(T ) = ∑N i=1 havg(wi) · fi(T )∑N\ni=1 fi(T ) = N∑ i=1 havg(wi) · pi(T ), (A1)\nwhere we denote each of the N words in a given dictionary as wi, word sentiment scores as havg(wi), word frequency as fi(T ), and normalized frequency of wi in T as pi(T ) = fi(T )/ ∑N i=1 fi(T ).\nWe note here for the general case, and additionally specify with the details of each method, that for each emotional arc we subtract the mean before computing the distance or clustering. To compute the distance between two emotional arcs, we use the city block distance metric:\nD(bi, bj) = l −1 l∑ t=1 |bi(t)− bj(t)|. (A2)\nOur null set of emotional arc time series is generated by randomly shuffling the words of each book that we consider. Other variations on generating this null set include sampling from a phrase-level parse of the book with a Markov process, using continuous space random walks directly, or shuffling on sentences.\nS2\n0 1 2 3 4 5 log10 (Rank)\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\nlo g\n1 0\n(N um\nbe r\nof do\nw nl\noa ds\n)\n0 1 2 3 4 5 log10 (Rank)\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\n5.5\n6.0\n6.5\n7.0\nlo g\n1 0\n(L en\ngt h)\n2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0 log10 (Downloads)\n3.8\n4.0\n4.2\n4.4\n4.6\n4.8\n5.0\n5.2\n5.4\nlo g\n1 0\n(L en\ngt h)\nFIG.

First 3 SVD modes and their negation with the closest stories to each. Again, to show the emotional arcs on the same scale as the modes, we show the modes directly from the rows of V T and weight the emotional arcs by the inverse of their coefficient in W for the particular mode. Shown in parenthesis for each story is the Project Gutenberg ID and the number of downloads from the Project Gutenberg website, respectively. Links below each story point to an interactive visualization on http://hedonometer.org which enables detailed exploration of the emotional arc for the story.\nIn an effort to develop a better intuition for the results of the principal component analysis by way of SVD, we plot Eq. 1 along with representations of the matrices in Fig. S3.\nFurther, we considered in Eq. 1 the mode coefficient in the matrix W , and in Fig S4 we plot the second line of the equation with W :\nWith A written as W · V T , the coefficients for each mode (row of V T ) for a book i are given as the rows of W . To reconstruct the emotional arc of book i, using mode j from V T , we simply multiply W [i, j] · V T [j, :]. Shown below in Fig. S5, we built the emotional arc for an example story using only the first mode through the first 12 modes.\nS4\nFIG. S3: Schematic of the Singular Value Decomposition applied to emotional arcs of Project Gutenberg books. Shown in A are 10 randomly chosen emotional arcs, in U a “spy” of the matrix, in Σ the decreasing singular values, and in V T sinusoidal modes. We emphasize that this representation is purely for intuition, as only U is a image of the actual matrix, and A has only 10 of the 1,737 books.\nFIG.

S5: Reconstruction of the emotional arc from Alice’s Adventures Under Ground, by Lewis Carroll. The addition of more modes from the SVD more closely reconstructs the detailed emotional arc. This book is well represented by the first mode alone, with only minor corrections from modes 2-11, as we should expect for a book whose emotional arc so closely resembles the “Rags to Riches” arc.\nS6\nAppendix C: Hierarchical Clustering\nWe use Ward’s method to generate a hierarchical clustering of stories, which proceeds by minimizing variance between clusters of books [37]. We again use the mean-centered books and the distance function given in Eq. A2 to generate the distance matrix.\nWe show a dendrogram of the 60 clusters with highest linkage cost in Fig. S6. A characteristic book from each cluster is shown on the right by sorting the books within each cluster by the total distance to other books in the cluster (e.g., considering each intra-cluster collection as a fully connected weighted network, we take the most central node), and in parenthesis the number of books in that cluster. In other words, we label each cluster by considering the network centrality of the fully connected cluster with edges weighted by the distance between stories. By cutting the dendrogram in Fig. S6 at various costs we are able to extract clusters of the desired granularity. For the cuts labeled 0, 1, and 2, we show these clusters in Figs. S7, S8, and S9.\nThe final linkage in the hierarchical clustering combines the two clusters in Fig. S7 of size 1203 (Panel A, Threshold 8000 Cluster 1) and size 548 (Panel B, Threshold 800 Cluster 2). Cluster 1 is much larger, and the main difference between these clusters appears to be their variance. Nevertheless, we are able to see from the cluster average emotional arc (shown in orange) that Cluster 1 most closely follows a “Tragedy with the happy ending” and Cluster 2 follows the “Man in a hole” story. The top stories in Cluster 1 are Piper in the Woods and Butterfly 9, in the Figure they are shown with their ID in the Project Gutenberg database. The most central stories for Cluster 2 are Asmodeus; or, The Devil on Two Sticks and Ghost Stories of an Antiquary.\nGoing through the linkage procedure in reverse, we see in Fig. S8 that Threshold 8000 Cluster 1 is the linkage of Threshold 3850 Cluster 1 and Threshold 3850 Cluster 3. We see that what was a “Tragedy with the happy ending” splits into a tragedy in Cluster 1 (with perhaps a small uptick) and a mostly flat Cluster 3. Threshold 8000 Cluster 2 is the linkage of Threshold 3850 Cluster 2 and Threshold 3850 Cluster 4, Panels B and D in Fig. S8, respectively. Cluster 2 here again shows the most variance, with what mostly closely resembles a “Romance” story shape. Cluster 4, on average, is the “man in the hole” story type.\nFinally, in Fig. S9 we see the 8 most different clusters as a collection of a familiar story types. In Panel A, Threshold 2050 Cluster 1 we have the “Romance” story. In Panel C, we have the “Rags to riches” (Cinderella) story. Panels E, F, and G are all “Man in a hole” stories of varying strength. In Panel H we find a large number of stories (360) that fall squarely into the “Tragedy” story type.\nS7\n02000400060008000\n(1) The Ladies’ Work-Book: Containing Instructions I...

The SOM works by finding the most similar emotional arc in a random collection of arcs. We use a 13x13 SOM (for 169 nodes, roughly 10% of the number of books), connected on a square grid, training according to the original procedure (with winner take all, and scaling functions across both distance and magnitude). We take the neighborhood influence function at iteration i as\nNbdk(i) = [ j ∈ N | d(k, j) < √ N · (i+ 1)α ] (D1)\nfor a node k in the set of nodes N , with distance function d and total number of nodes N . For result shown here we take α = −0.15. We implement the learning adaptation function at training iteration i as\nf(i) = (i+ 1)β , (D2)\nagain with β = −0.15 In Fig. S10 we see both the B-Matrix to demonstrate the strength of spatial clustering and a heat-map showing where we find the winning nodes. The A–I labels refer to the individual nodes shown in Fig. S11, and we observe three spatial groups in the both panels of S10: (1) A, C, and D, (2) G and H, and (3) I and F. These spatial clusters reinforce the visible similarity of the winning node arcs. We show the winning node emotional arcs and the arcs of books for which they are the winners in Fig. S11. The legend shows the node ID, numbers the cluster by size, and in parenthesis indicates the size of the cluster on that individual node. In Panels A, C, and D we see varying strengths of the “Rags to Riches” emotional arc. In Panel B, the second largest individual cluster consists of the “Tragedy” stories. In Panels F and I we see the “Boy Meets Girl” story type, with a more pronounced positive start and happier ending in Panel F. In Panels G and H we again see the “Boy Meets Girl” with more variation and a deeper “Man in the Hole” at the end. Each of these top stories are all readily identifiable, yet again demonstrating the universality of these story types.\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nNi\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nN j\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFG H I\n0.0\n1.5\n3.0\n4.5\n6.0\n7.5\n9.0\n10.5\n12.0\n13.5\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12\nNi\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nN j\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nFG H I\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nFIG.

S12: Example result of the ring sort for 1000 iterations using a final scaling exponent of -1 for the cost function. Panel A shows a random initial sort, panel B shows the sorted result, and panel C shifts this result to put the story with maximum total cost in position 0 (here with no change). We minimize using a “simulated annealing” procedure by starting with a lower scaling parameter α (e.g., E1), moving the scaling from 0.25 → 1 for later iterations, with similar results. Block diagonal structure is present, indicating that there are clusters of stories that have similar shapes.\nAppendix E: Ring Sort\nWe first compute the pairwise distance between each book in our data set using Eq. A2. We then apply a shuffling algorithm [39] to order books on a discretized ring so that similar books are as close to each other as possible. We minimize the cost\nC = ∑ i ∑ j\n1\n|i− j|αD(bi∗ , bj∗) (E1)\nwhere D(bi∗ , bj∗) is the distance between the emotional arcs of books in position i and j on the ring (with i ∗ and j∗ their original index), and α sets the scaling of the cost across the ring. For each iteration of the optimization procedure, we take the next book from the collection, book i, and consider all possible swaps of books i, making the swap that lowers C the most. We start with α = 0.25 and relax to α = 1 as the optimization proceeds to increase the chances of achieving a global maximum in the cost function (akin to a “simulated annealing” procedure). With an initially random shuffle of books onto the ring, we run the optimization for 100,000 iterations or until there is no better arrangement (such that on average, each book moves ≥ 50 times).\nIn Figs. S12A and S12B we show a randomly shuffled ring and the optimized result. The visual presence of multiple coherent block diagonal structures indicates that there are distinct clusters of emotional arcs with the Gutenberg Corpus. For lack of a straightforward, analytical determination of the clusters after this optimization, the result we present in Fig. S12 is qualitative.\nS14\nAppendix F: Word salads\nFigs.

    "abstractText" : "Advances in computing power, natural language processing, and digitization of text now make it possible to study our a culture’s evolution through its texts using a “big data” lens. Our ability to communicate relies in part upon a shared emotional experience, with stories often following distinct emotional trajectories, forming patterns that are meaningful to us. Here, by classifying the emotional arcs for a filtered subset of 1,737 stories from Project Gutenberg’s fiction collection, we find a set of six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex narratives. We strengthen our findings by separately applying optimization, linear decomposition, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. For each of these six core emotional arcs, we examine the closest characteristic stories in publication today and find that particular emotional arcs enjoy greater success, as measured by downloads.",
