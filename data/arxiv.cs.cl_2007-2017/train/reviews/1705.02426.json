An effective and scalable solution for this problem is crucial for the true success of knowledge-based inference in a broad range of applications. This paper proposes a novel framework for optimizing the latent representations with respect to the \\textit{analogical} properties of the embedded entities and relations. By formulating the learning objective in a differentiable fashion, our model enjoys both theoretical power and computational scalability, and significantly outperformed a large number of representative baseline methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the model offers an elegant unification of several well-known methods in multi-relational embedding, which can be proven to be special instantiations of our framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 May 2017 01:40:28 GMT  (77kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02426v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 16:58:24 GMT  (77kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02426v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["hanxiao liu", "yuexin wu", "yiming yang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02426"}
