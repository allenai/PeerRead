      "text" : "Machine Translation (MT) has traditionally been one of the most complex language processing problems, but recent advances of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) make it possible to perform translation using a simple end-to-end architecture. In the Encoder-Decoder model (Cho et al., 2014b; Sutskever et al., 2014), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called the encoder reads the whole sequence of source words to produce a fixedlength vector, and then another RNN called the decoder generates the target words from the vector. The Encoder-Decoder model has been extended with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a), which allows the model to jointly learn the soft alignment between the source language and the target language. NMT models have achieved state-of-the-art results in English-to-French and English-to-German trans-\nlation tasks (Luong et al., 2015b; Luong et al., 2015a). However, it is yet to be seen whether NMT is competitive with traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approaches in translation tasks for structurally distant language pairs such as English-to-Japanese.\nFigure 1 shows a pair of parallel sentences in English and Japanese. English and Japanese are linguistically distant in many respects; they have different syntactic constructions, and words and phrases are defined in different lexical units. In this example, the Japanese word “緑茶” is aligned with the English words “green” and “tea”, and the English word sequence “a cup of” is aligned with a special symbol “null”, which is not explicitly translated into any Japanese words. One way to solve this mismatch problem is to consider the phrase structure of the English sentence and align the phrase “a cup of green tea” with “緑茶”. In SMT, it is known that incorporating syntactic constituents of the source language into the models improves word alignment (Yamada and Knight, 2001) and translation accuracy (Liu et al., 2006; Neubig and Duh, 2014). However, the existing NMT models do not allow us to perform this kind of alignment.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attentional NMT model to take advantage of syntactic infor-\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 07\n5v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\n6\nmation. Following the phrase structure of a source sentence, we encode the sentence recursively in a bottom-up fashion to produce a vector representation of the sentence and decode it while aligning the input phrases and words with the output. Our experimental results on the WAT’15 English-toJapanese translation task show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art translation accuracy."

In other words, the NMT models directly estimate the conditional probability p(y|x) given a large collection of source and target sentence pairs (x,y). An NMT model consists of an encoder process and a decoder process, and hence they are often called Encoder-Decoder models. In the Encoder-Decoder models, a sentence is treated as a sequence of words. In the encoder process, the encoder embeds each of the source words x = (x1, x2, · · · , xn) into a d-dimensional vector space. The decoder then outputs a word sequence y = (y1, y2, · · · , ym) in the target language given the information on the source sentence provided by the encoder. Here, n and m are the lengths of the source and target sentences, respectively. RNNs allow one to effectively embed sequential data into the vector space.\nIn the RNN encoder, the i-th hidden unit hi ∈ Rd×1 is calculated given the i-th input xi and the previous hidden unit hi−1 ∈ Rd×1,\nhi = fenc(xi,hi−1), (1)\nwhere fenc is a non-linear function, and the initial hidden unit h0 is usually set to zeros. The encoding function fenc is recursively applied until the nth hidden unit hn is obtained. The RNN EncoderDecoder models assume that hn represents a vector of the meaning of the input sequence up to the n-th word.\nAfter encoding the whole input sentence into the vector space, we decode it in a similar way. The initial decoder unit s1 is initialized with the input sentence vector (s1 = hn). Given the previous target word and the j-th hidden unit of the decoder, the conditional probability that the j-th\ntarget word is generated is calculated as follows:\np(yj |y<j ,x) = g(sj), (2)\nwhere g is a non-linear function. The j-th hidden unit of the decoder is calculated by using another non-linear function fdec as follows:\nsj = fdec(yj−1, sj−1). (3)\nWe employ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Gers et al., 2000) in place of vanilla RNN units. The tth LSTM unit consists of several gates and two different types of states: a hidden unit ht ∈ Rd×1 and a memory cell ct ∈ Rd×1,\nit = σ(W (i)xt +U (i)ht−1 + b (i)), ft = σ(W (f)xt +U (f)ht−1 + b (f)), ot = σ(W (o)xt +U (o)ht−1 + b (o)), c̃t = tanh(W (c̃)xt +U (c̃)ht−1 + b (c̃)),\nct = it c̃t + ft ct−1, ht = ot tanh(ct), (4)\nwhere each of it, ft, ot and c̃t ∈ Rd×1 denotes an input gate, a forget gate, an output gate, and a state for updating the memory cell, respectively. W (·) ∈ Rd×d and U (·) ∈ Rd×d are weight matrices, b(·) ∈ Rd×1 is a bias vector, and xt ∈ Rd×1 is the word embedding of the t-th input word. σ(·) is the logistic function, and the operator denotes element-wise multiplication between vectors."

The attention mechanism allows the NMT models to explicitly quantify how much each encoder state contributes to the word prediction at each time step.\nIn the attentional NMT model in Luong et al. (2015a), at the j-th step of the decoder process, the attention score αj(i) between the i-th source hidden unit hi and the j-th target hidden unit sj is calculated as follows:\nαj(i) = exp(hi · sj)∑n\nk=1 exp(hk · sj) , (5)\nwhere hi · sj is the inner product of hi and sj , which is used to directly calculate the similarity score between hi and sj . The j-th context vector\ndj is calculated as the summation vector weighted by αj(i):\ndj = n∑\ni=1\nαj(i)hi. (6)\nTo incorporate the attention mechanism into the decoding process, the context vector is used for the the j-th word prediction by putting an additional hidden layer s̃j :\ns̃j = tanh(Wd[sj ; dj ] + bd), (7)\nwhere [sj ;dj ] ∈ R2d×1 is the concatenation of sj and dj , and Wd ∈ Rd×2d and bd ∈ Rd×1 are a weight matrix and a bias vector, respectively.

      "text" : "The exsiting NMT models treat a sentence as a sequence of words and neglect the structure of\na sentence inherent in language. We propose a novel tree-based encoder in order to explicitly take the syntactic structure into consideration in the NMT model. We focus on the phrase structure of a sentence and construct a sentence vector from phrase vectors in a bottom-up fashion. The sentence vector in the tree-based encoder is therefore composed of the structural information rather than the sequential data. Figure 3 shows our proposed model, which we call a tree-to-sequence attentional NMT model.\nIn Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) (Sag et al., 2003), a sentence is composed of multiple phrase units and represented as a binary tree as shown in Figure 1. Following the structure of the sentence, we construct a tree-based encoder on top of the standard sequential encoder. The k-th parent hidden unit h(phr)k for the k-th phrase is calculated using the left and right child hidden units hlk and h r k as follows:\nh (phr) k = ftree(h l k,h r k), (10)\nwhere ftree is a non-linear function.\nWe construct a tree-based encoder with LSTM units, where each node in the binary tree is represented with an LSTM unit. When initializing the leaf units of the tree-based encoder, we employ the sequential LSTM units described in Section 2.1. Each non-leaf node is also represented with an LSTM unit, and we employ Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015) to calculate the LSTM unit of the parent node which has two child LSTM units. The hidden unit h(phr)k ∈ R\nd×1 and the memory cell c (phr) k ∈ R d×1 for the k-th parent node are calcu-\nlated as follows:\nik = σ(U (i) l h l k +U (i) r h r k + b (i)), f lk = σ(U (fl) l h l k +U (fl) r h r k + b (fl)), f rk = σ(U (fr) l h l k +U (fr) r h r k + b (fr)), ok = σ(U (o) l h l k +U (o) r h r k + b (o)), c̃k = tanh(U (c̃) l h l k +U (c̃) r h r k + b (c̃)),\nc (phr) k = ik c̃k + f l k clk + f rk crk, h (phr) k = ok tanh(c (phr) k ), (11)\nwhere ik, f lk, f r k , oj , c̃j ∈ Rd×1 are an input gate, the forget gates for left and right child units, an output gate, and a state for updating the memory cell, respectively. clk and c r k are the memory cells for the left and right child units, respectively. U (·) ∈ Rd×d denotes a weight matrix, and b(·) ∈ Rd×1 represents a bias vector.\nOur proposed tree-based encoder is a natural extension of the conventional sequential encoder, since Tree-LSTM is a generalization of chainstructured LSTM (Tai et al., 2015). Our encoder differs from the original Tree-LSTM in the calculation of the LSTM units for the leaf nodes. The motivation is to construct the phrase nodes in a context-sensitive way, which, for example, allows the model to compute different representations for multiple occurrences of the same word in a sentence because the sequential LSTMs are calculated in the context of the previous units. This ability contrasts with the original Tree-LSTM, in which the leaves are composed only of the word embeddings without any contextual information."

      "text" : "We now have two different sentence vectors: one is from the sequence encoder and the other from the tree-based encoder. As shown in Figure 3, we provide another Tree-LSTM unit which has the final sequential encoder unit (hn) and the tree-based encoder unit (h(phr)root ) as two child units and set it as the initial decoder s1 as follows:\ns1 = gtree(hn,h (phr) root ), (12)\nwhere gtree is the same function as ftree with another set of Tree-LSTM parameters. This initialization allows the decoder to capture information from both the sequential data and phrase structures. Zoph and Knight (2016) proposed a similar method using a Tree-LSTM for initializing the\ndecoder, with which they translate multiple source languages to one target language. When the syntactic parser fails to output a parse tree for a sentence, we encode the sentence with the sequential encoder by setting h(phr)root = 0. Our proposed treebased encoder therefore works with any sentences."

      "text" : "We adopt the attention mechanism into our treeto-sequence model in a novel way. Our model gives attention not only to sequential hidden units but also to phrase hidden units. This attention mechanism tells us which words or phrases in the source sentence are important when the model decodes a target word. The j-th context vector dj is composed of the sequential and phrase vectors weighted by the attention score αj(i):\ndj = n∑\ni=1 αj(i)hi + 2n−1∑ i=n+1 αj(i)h (phr) i . (13)\nNote that a binary tree has n − 1 phrase nodes if the tree has n leaves. We set a final decoder s̃j in the same way as Equation (7).\nIn addition, we adopt the input-feeding method (Luong et al., 2015a) in our model, which is a method for feeding s̃j−1, the previous unit to predict the word yj−1, into the current target hidden unit sj ,\nsj = fdec(yj−1, [sj−1; s̃j−1]), (14)\nwhere [sj−1; s̃j−1] is the concatenation of sj−1 and s̃j−1. The input-feeding approach contributes to the enrichment in the calculation of the decoder, because s̃j−1 is an informative unit which can be used to predict the output word as well as to be compacted with attentional context vectors. Luong et al. (2015a) showed that the input-feeding approach improves BLEU scores. We also observed the same improvement in our preliminary experiments."

      "text" : "The biggest computational bottleneck of training the NMT models is in the calculation of the softmax layer described in Equation (8), because its computational cost increases linearly with the size of the vocabulary. The speedup technique with GPUs has proven useful for sequence-based NMT models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al.,\n2015a) but it is not easily applicable when dealing with tree-structured data. In order to reduce the training cost of the NMT models at the softmax layer, we employ BlackOut (Ji et al., 2016), a sampling-based approximation method. BlackOut has been shown to be effective in RNN Language Models (RNNLMs) and allows a model to run reasonably fast even with a million word vocabulary with CPUs.\nAt each word prediction step in the training, BlackOut estimates the conditional probability in Equation (2) for the target word and K negative samples using a weighted softmax function. The negative samples are drawn from the unigram distribution raised to the power β ∈ [0, 1] (Mikolov et al., 2013). The unigram distribution is estimated using the training data and β is a hyperparameter. BlackOut is closely related to Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) (Gutmann and Hyvärinen, 2012) and achieves better perplexity than the original softmax and NCE in RNNLMs. The advantages of Blackout over the other methods are discussed in Ji et al. (2016). Note that BlackOut can be used as the original softmax once the training is finished."

(15)\nDecoding in the NMT models is a generative process and depends on the target language model given a source sentence. The score becomes smaller as the target sentence becomes longer, and thus the simple beam search does not work well when decoding a long sentence (Cho et al., 2014a; Pouget-Abadie et al., 2014). In our preliminary experiments, the beam search with the length normalization in Cho et al. (2014a) was not effective in English-to-Japanese translation. The method in Pouget-Abadie et al.

Although the result of softmax is better than those of BlackOut (K = 500, 2000), the training time of softmax per epoch is about three times longer than that of BlackOut even with the small dataset.\nAs to the results of the ANMT model, reversing the word order in the input sentence decreases the scores in English-to-Japanese translation, which contrasts with the results of other language pairs reported in previous work (Sutskever et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015a). By taking syntactic information into consideration, our proposed model improves the scores, compared to the sequential attention-based approach.\nWe found that better perplexity does not always lead to better translation scores with BlackOut as shown in Table 3. One of the possible reasons is that BlackOut distorts the target word distribution\n6http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/WAT/ evaluation/automatic_evaluation_systems/ automaticEvaluationJA.html\nby the modified unigram-based negative sampling where frequent words can be treated as the negative samples multiple times at each training step.\nEffects of the proposed beam search Table 4 shows the results on the development data of proposed method with BlackOut (K = 2000) by the simple beam search and our proposed beam search. The beam size is set to 6 or 20 in the simple beam search, and to 20 in our proposed search. We can see that our proposed search outperforms the simple beam search in both scores. Unlike RIBES, the BLEU score is sensitive to the beam size and becomes lower as the beam size increases. We found that the BP had a relatively large impact on the BLEU score in the simple beam search as the beam size increased.

The additional attentional relations are also illustrated for comparison. We can see the target words softly aligned with source words and phrases.\nIn Figure 4, the Japanese word “液晶” means “liquid crystal”, and it has a high attention score (α = 0.41) with the English phrase “liquid crystal for active matrix”. This is because the j-th target hidden unit sj has the contextual information about the previous words y<j including “活性マ トリックスの” (“for active matrix” in English). The Japanese word “セル” is softly aligned with the phrase “the cells” with the highest attention score (α = 0.35). In Japanese, there is no definite article like “the” in English, and it is usually aligned with null described as Section 1.\nIn Figure 5, in the case of the Japanese word “示” (“showed” in English), the attention score with the English phrase “showed excellent performance” (α = 0.25) is higher than that with the English word “showed” (α = 0.01). The Japanese word “の” (“of” in English) is softly aligned with the phrase “of Si dot MOS capacitor” with the highest attention score (α = 0.30). It is because our attention mechanism takes each previous context of the Japanese phrases “優れた性能” (“excellent performance” in English) and “Ｓｉドッ ト ＭＯＳ コンデンサ” (“Si dot MOS capacitor” in English) into account and softly aligned the target words with the whole phrase when translating the English verb “showed” and the preposition “of”. Our proposed model can thus flexibly learn the attentional relations between English and Japanese.\nWe observed that our model translated the word “active” into “活性”, a synonym of the reference word “アクティブ”. We also found similar ex-\namples in other sentences, where our model outputs synonyms of the reference words, e.g. “女” and “女性” (“female” in English) and “NASA” and “航空宇宙局” (“National Aeronautics and Space Administration” in English). These translations are penalized in terms of BLEU scores, but they do not necessarily mean that the translations were wrong.

(2014) have shown that making the input sequences reversed is effective in a French-to-English translation task, and the technique has also proven effective in translation tasks between other European language pairs (Luong et al., 2015a). All of the NMT models mentioned above are based on sequential encoders. To incorporate structural information into the NMT models, Cho et al. (2014a) proposed to jointly learn structures inherent in source-side languages but did not report improvement of translation performance. These studies motivated us to investigate the role of syntactic structures explicitly given by existing syntactic parsers in the NMT models.\nThe attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) has promoted NMT onto the next stage. It\nenables the NMT models to translate while aligning the target with the source. Luong et al. (2015a) refined the attention model so that it can dynamically focus on local windows rather than the entire sentence. They also proposed a more effective attentional path in the calculation of ANMT models. Subsequently, several ANMT models have been proposed (Cheng et al., 2016; Cohn et al., 2016); however, each model is based on the existing sequential attentional models and does not focus on a syntactic structure of languages."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a novel syntactic approach that extends attentional NMT models. We focus on the phrase structure of the input sentence and build a tree-based encoder following the parsed tree. Our proposed tree-based encoder is a natural extension of the sequential encoder model, where the leaf units of the tree-LSTM in the encoder can work together with the original sequential LSTM encoder. Moreover, the attention mechanism allows the tree-based encoder to align not only the input words but also input phrases with the output words. Experimental results on the WAT’15 English-to-Japanese translation dataset demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the best RIBES score and outperforms the sequential attentional NMT model."
