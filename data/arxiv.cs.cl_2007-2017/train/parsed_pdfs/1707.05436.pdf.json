      "text" : "Recently, neural machine translation (NMT) models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) have obtained state-of-the-art performance on many language pairs. Their success depends on the representation they use to bridge the source and target language sentences. However, this representation, a sequence of fixed-dimensional vectors, differs considerably from most theories about mental representations of sentences, and from traditional natural language processing pipelines, in which semantics is built up compositionally using a recursive syntactic structure.\nPerhaps as evidence of this, current NMT models still suffer from syntactic errors such as attachment (Shi et al., 2016). We argue that instead of letting the NMT model rely solely on the implicit structure it learns during training (Cho et al.,\n∗ Corresponding author. 1Our code is publicly available at https://github.\ncom/howardchenhd/Syntax-awared-NMT/\n2014a), we can improve its performance by augmenting it with explicit structural information and using this information throughout the model. This has two benefits.\nFirst, the explicit syntactic information will help the encoder generate better source side representations. Li et al. (2015) show that for tasks in which long-distance semantic dependencies matter, representations learned from recursive models using syntactic structures may be more powerful than those from sequential recurrent models. In the NMT case, given syntactic information, it will be easier for the encoder to incorporate long distance dependencies into better representations, which is especially important for the translation of long sentences.\nSecond, it becomes possible for the decoder to\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n05 43\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n8 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nuse syntactic information to guide its reordering decisions better (especially for language pairs with significant reordering, like Chinese-English). Although the attention model (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and the coverage model (Tu et al., 2016; Mi et al., 2016) provide effective mechanisms to control the generation of translation, these mechanisms work at the word level and cannot capture phrasal cohesion between the two languages (Fox, 2002; Kim et al., 2017). With explicit syntactic structure, the decoder can generate the translation more in line with the source syntactic structure. For example, when translating the phrase zhu manila dashiguan in Figure 1, the tree structure indicates that zhu ‘in’ and manila form a syntactic unit, so that the model can avoid breaking this unit up to make an incorrect translation like “in embassy of manila” 2.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel encoderdecoder model that makes use of a precomputed source-side syntactic tree in both the encoder and decoder. In the encoder (§3.3), we improve the tree encoder of Eriguchi et al. (2016) by introducing a bidirectional tree encoder. For each source tree node (including the source words), we generate a representation containing information both from below (as with the original bottom-up encoder) and from above (using a top-down encoder). Thus, the annotation of each node summarizes the surrounding sequential context, as well as the entire syntactic context.\nIn the decoder (§3.4), we incorporate source syntactic tree structure into the attention model via an extension of the coverage model of Tu et al. (2016). With this tree-coverage model, we can better guide the generation phase of translation, for example, to learn a preference for phrasal cohesion (Fox, 2002). Moreover, with a tree encoder, the decoder may try to translate both a parent and a child node, even though they overlap; the treecoverage model enables the decoder to learn to avoid this problem.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we carry out experiments on Chinese-English translation. Our experiments show that: (1) our bidirectional tree encoder based NMT system achieves significant improvements over the standard attention-based NMT system, and (2) incorporating source tree structure into the attention model yields a further improvement.\n2According to the source sentence, “embassy” belongs to “australia”, not “manila”.\nIn all, we demonstrate an improvement of +3.54 BLEU over a standard attentional NMT system, and +1.90 BLEU over a stronger NMT system with a Tree-LSTM encoder (Eriguchi et al., 2016) and a coverage model (Tu et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses source-side syntax in both the encoder and decoder of an NMT system."

The bidirectional GRU consists of a forward and a backward GRU, as shown in Figure 2. The forward GRU reads the source sentence from left to right and calculates a sequence of forward hidden states ( −→ h1, . . . , −→ hI). The backward GRU scans the source sentence from right to left, resulting in a sequence of backward hidden states ( ←− h1, . . . , ←− hI).

(2016) use HPSG trees, we use phrase-structure trees as in the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005). Currently, we are only using the structure information from the tree without the syntactic labels. Thus our approach should be applicable to any syntactic grammar that provides such a tree structure (Figure 1(b)).\nMore formally, the encoder is given a source sentence x = x1 · · · xI as well as a source tree whose leaves are labeled x1, . . . , xI . We assume that this tree is strictly binary branching. For convenience, each node is assigned an index. The leaf nodes get indices 1, . . . , I, which is the same as their word indices. For any node with index k, let p(k) denote the index of the node’s parent (if it exists), and L(k) and R(k) denote the indices of the node’s left and right children (if they exist)."

(2016), we build a tree encoder on top of the sequential encoder (as shown in Figure 3(a)). If node k is a leaf node, its hidden state is the annotation produced by the sequential encoder:\nh↑k = ←→ hk .\nThus, the encoder is able to capture both sequential context and syntactic context.\nIf node k is an interior node, its hidden state is the combination of its previously calculated left\nchild hidden state hL(k) and right child hidden state hR(k):\nh↑k = f (h ↑ L(k), h ↑ R(k)) (8)\nwhere f (·) is a nonlinear function, originally a Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015; Eriguchi et al., 2016).\nThe first improvement we make to the above tree encoder is that, to be consistent with the sequential encoder model, we use Tree-GRU units instead of Tree-LSTM units. Similar to TreeLSTMs, the Tree-GRU has gating mechanisms to control the information flow inside the unit for every node without separate memory cells. Then, Eq. 8 is calculated by a Tree-GRU as follows:\nrL = σ(U (rL) L h ↑ L(k) + U (rL) R h ↑ R(k) + b (rL)) rR = σ(U (rR) L h ↑ L(k) + U (rR) R h ↑ R(k) + b (rR)) zL = σ(U (zL) L h ↑ L(k) + U (zL) R h ↑ R(k) + b (zL)) zR = σ(U (zR) L h ↑ L(k) + U (zR) R h ↑ R(k) + b (zR))\nz = σ(U(z)L h ↑ L(k) + U (z) R h ↑ R(k) + b (z)) h̃↑k = tanh ( UL(rL h↑L(k)) + UR(rR h ↑ R(k)) ) h↑k = zL h ↑ L(k) + zR h ↑ R(k) + z h̃ ↑ k\nwhere rL, rR are the reset gates and zL, zR are the update gates for the left and right children, and z is the update gate for the internal hidden state h̃↑k .

      "heading" : "3.3 Bidirectional Tree Encoder",
      "text" : "Although the bottom-up tree encoder can take advantage of syntactic structure, the learned representation of a node is based on its subtree only; it contains no information from higher up in the tree. In particular, the representation of leaf nodes is still the sequential one. Thus no syntactic information is fed into words. By analogy with the bidirectional sequential encoder, we propose a natural extension of the bottom-up tree encoder: the bidirectional tree encoder (Figure 3(b)).\nUnlike the bottom-up tree encoder or the rightto-left sequential encoder, the top-down encoder by itself would have no lexical information as input. To address this issue, we feed the hidden states of the bottom-up encoder to the top-down encoder. In this way, the information of the whole syntactic tree is handed to the root node and propagated to its offspring by the top-down encoder.\nIn the top-down encoder, each hidden state has only one predecessor. In fact, the top-down path from root of a tree to any node can be viewed as a sequential recurrent neural network. We can calculate the hidden states of each node top-down using a standard sequential GRU.\nFirst, the hidden state of the root node ρ is simply computed as follows:\nh↓ρ = tanh (Wh ↑ ρ + b) (9)\nwhere W and b are a weight matrix and bias vector. Then, other nodes are calculated by a GRU. For hidden state h↓k :\nh↓k = GRU(h ↓ p(k), h ↑ k) (10)\nwhere p(k) is the parent index of k. We replace the weight matrices Wr, Ur, Wz, Uz, W and U in the standard GRU with PrD, Q r D, P z D, Q z D, PD, and QD, respectively. The subscript D is either L or R depending on whether node k is a left or right child, respectively.\nFinally, the annotation of each node is obtained by concatenating its bottom-up hidden state and top-down hidden state:\nhlk = h↑kh↓k  .\nThis allows the tree structure information flow from the root to the leaves (words). Thus, all the annotations are based on the full context of word sequence and syntactic tree structure.\nKokkinos and Potamianos (2017) propose a similar bidirectional Tree-GRU for sentiment analysis, which differs from ours in several respects: in the bottom-up encoder, we use separate reset/update gates for left and right children, analogous to Tree-LSTMs (Tai et al., 2015); in the topdown encoder, we use separate weights for left and right children.\nTeng and Zhang (2016) also propose a bidirectional Tree-LSTM encoder for classification tasks. They use a more complex head-lexicalization scheme to feed the top-down encoder. We will compare their model with ours in the experiments."

      "heading" : "3.4 Tree-Coverage Model",
      "text" : "We also extend the decoder to incorporate information about the source syntax into the attention model. We have observed two issues in translations produced using the tree encoder. First, a syntactic phrase in the source sentence is often incorrectly translated into discontinuous words in the output. Second, since the non-leaf node annotations contain more information than the leaf node annotations, the attention model prefers to attend to the non-leaf nodes, which may aggravate the over-translation problem (translating the same part of the sentence more than once).\nAs shown in Figure 4(a), almost all the non-leaf nodes are attended too many times during decoding. As a result, the Chinese phrase zhu manila is translated twice because the model attends to the node spanning zhu manila even though both words have already been translated; there is no mechanism to prevent this.\nInspired by the approaches of Cohn et al. (2016), Feng et al. (2016), Tu et al. (2016) and Mi et al. (2016), we propose to use prior knowledge to control the attention mechanism. In our case, the prior knowledge is the source syntactic information.\nIn particular, we build our model on top of the word coverage model proposed by Tu et al. (2016), which alleviate the problems of over-translation and under-translation (failing to translate part of a sentence). The word coverage model makes the attention at a given time step j dependent on the attention at previous time steps via coverage vectors:\nC j,i = GRU(C j−1,i, α j,i, d j−1, hi). (11)\nThe coverage vectors are, in turn, used to update the attention at the next time step, by a small modification to the calculation of e j,i in Eq. (7):\ne j,i = vTa tanh (Wad j−1 + Uahi + VaC j−1,i). (12)\nThe word coverage model could be interpreted as a control mechanism for the attention model. Like the standard attention model, this coverage model sees the source-sentence annotations as a bag of vectors; it knows nothing about word order, still less about syntactic structure.\nFor our model, we extend the word coverage model to coverage on the tree structure by adding a coverage vector for each node in the tree. We further incorporate source tree structure information into the calculation of the coverage vector by requiring each node’s coverage vector to depend on its children’s coverage vectors and attentions at the previous time step:\nC j,i = GRU(C j−1,i, α j,i, d j−1, hi,\nC j−1,L(i), α j,L(i),\nC j−1,R(i), α j,R(i)).\n(13)\nAlthough both child and parent nodes of a subtree are helpful for translation, they may supply redundant information. With our mechanism, when the child node is used to produce a translation, the coverage vector of its parent node will reflect this fact, so that the decoder may avoid using the redundant information in the parent node. Figure 4(b) shows a heatmap of the attention of our tree structure enhanced attention model. The attention of non-leaf nodes becomes more concentrated and the over-translation of zhu manila is corrected."

To verify our assumption that model consistency is important for performance, we also conduct experiments to compare TreeLSTM and Tree-GRU on top of LSTM-based encoder-decoder settings. Tree-Lstm with LSTM based sequential model can obtain 1.02 BLEU improvement(Table 3, row 13′), while Tree-LSTM with GRU based sequential model only gets 0.75 BLEU improvement.

These results are shown in Table 4. Row 4′ shows that, even with the same annotation size, our bidirectional tree encoder works better than the original Tree-LSTM encoder (row 2).

Our bidirectional tree encoder gives a better result, suggesting that head word information may not be as helpful for machine translation as it is for syntactic parsing.\nWhen we set the hidden size back to 1024, we found that training the bidirectional tree encoder\nwas more difficult. Therefore, we adopted a twophase training strategy: first, we train the parameters of the bottom-up encoder based NMT system; then, with the initialization of bottom-up encoder and random initialization of the top-down part and decoder, we train the bidirectional tree encoder based NMT system.

In this paper, we improve this model by explicitly incorporating source-side syntactic trees. More specifically, we propose (1) a bidirectional tree encoder which learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) a tree-coverage model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the sequential attentional model as well as a stronger baseline with a bottom-up tree encoder and word coverage.1",
