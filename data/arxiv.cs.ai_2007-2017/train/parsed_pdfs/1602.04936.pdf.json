In our proposed method we use Q-learning and SARSA algorithms with generalised reward function to train the reinforcement learning agent. We evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithms on two real-time strategy games called BattleCity and S3. There are two main advantages of having such an approach as compared to other works in RTS. (1) We can ignore the concept of a simulator which is often game specific and is usually hard coded in any type of RTS games (2) our system can learn from interaction with any opponents and quickly change the strategy according to the opponents and do not need any human traces as used in previous works.\nKeywords : Reinforcement learning, Machine learning, Real time strategy, Artificial intelligence."

      "text" : "Existence of a good artificial intelligence(AI) technique in the background of a game is one of the major factor for the fun and re-play ability in commercial computer games. Although AI has been applied successfully in several games such as chess, backgammon or checkers when it comes to real-time games the pre-defined scripts which is usually used to simulate the artificial intelligence in chess, backgammon etc [11]. does not seem to work. This is because in real-time games decisions has to be made in real-time as well as the search space is huge and as such they do not contain any true AI for learning [2]. Traditional planning approaches are difficult in case of RTS games because they have various factors like huge decision spaces, adversarial domains, partiallyobservable, non-deterministic and real-time, (real time means while deciding the best actions, the game continues running and states change simultaneously)."

      "text" : "Today game developing companies have started showing more interest in RTS games. Unlike turn based strategy games, where one has the ability to take ones own time, in real time strategy games,\nall movement, construction, combat etc., are all occurring in real time. In a typical RTS game, the screen contains a map area which consists of the game world with buildings, units and terrain. There are usually several players in an RTS game. Other than the players there are various game entities called participants, units and structures. These are under the control of the players and the players need to save their assets and/or destroy assets of the opponent players by making use of their control over the entities. We are using 2 RTS games (1) BattleCity and (2) S3 game for our evaluation. A snapshot of two RTS games called BattleCity and S3 are given in Figure 1."

      "text" : "One of the major works using Online casebased planning [6] techniques for Real Time Strategy Games was published in [9]. On-line casebased planning revises case based planning for strategic real-time domains involving on-line planning.\nIn [8] a case-based planning system called Darmok2 is introduced that can play RTS games. They introduced a set of algorithms that can be used to learn plans, represented as petri-nets, from one or more human demonstrations. Another work by the same authors which uses Darmok2 but addresses the issues of plan acquisition, on-line plan execution, interleaved planning and execution and on-line plan adaptation is [7].\nIn [3] the authors summarize their work in exploring the use of the first order inductive learning (FOIL) algorithm for learning rules which can be used to represent opponent strategies.\nIn [13] the authors improve Darmok2 using information related to sensors of the game. We refer to that work as PR-Model in this paper. PR-model is capable of learning how to play RTS games by observing human demonstrations. Using human traces PR-model makes plans to play games. Prioritize the plan according to the feedback of the game and feedbacks are decided using some rule which depends on the sensors of the game.\nDrawbacks of all case based learning [4] approaches as mentioned above are (1) It requires expert demonstrations for making plans (2) after training is done, no further learning takes place (3) to cover large state spaces it would require large number of rules in the plan base (4) no exploration for optimal solution. Only follows human traces.. Stefan Wender [5] uses Reinforcement Learning for City Site Selection in the TurnBased Strategy Game Civilization IV. Civilization IV is the strategy game it is a turn-based game while Battle City is Real time game.\nStefan Wender [5] uses Reinforcement Learning for City Site Selection in the Turn-Based Strategy Game Civilization IV. Civilization IV is the strategy game similar to S3 but it is a turn-based game while S3 is Real time multi agent game.\nIn this paper we aim to do away with the hard coded simulator and propose a learning approach based on Reinforcement Learning [1](RL) wherein sensor information from the current game-state is used to select the best action. Reinforcement learning is used because of its advantages over previous strategies. Specifically (1) RL cuts out the need to manually specify rules. RL agents learn simply by playing the game against other human players or even other RL agents (2) for large state spaces, RL can be combined with a function approximator such as a neural network, to approximate the evaluation function (3) RL agent always explores for optimal solution to reach the goal (4) RL has been applied widely to many other fields, such as robotics, board games ,turn based games and single agent games with great results, but hardly ever on RTS multi-agent games."

      "text" : "Reinforcement Learning [1] is the field of Machine Learning which deals with what to do, how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward signal.The learner does not know which actions to take, as in most forms of machine learning, but instead must discover which actions gives the most reward by applying them. In the most interesting and challenging cases, actions may affect not only the immediate\nreward but also the next situation and, through that, all subsequent rewards.\nWith comparing reinforcement learning [12] to RTS game environment an AI player learns by interacting with the environment and observing the feed-backs of these interactions. This is same as the fundamental way in which humans (and animals) learn. As a human, we can perform actions and observe the results of these actions on the environment. The same way RL-agent interacts with the environment and observes the result and assign the reward or penalty to state or state-action pair according to the desirability of the resultant state."

So it does random actions and observe the resultant state using some sensor information of the game and give feedback (in the form of reward which is further used to calculate the Q-Values for the state-action pairs or Q-Table) of that action to the previous state according to the desirability of the current state. Q-Values of the state-action pairs are known as Q-Table which define a policy. After every action policy updates Q-Values for the state action pairs (Q-Table) this policy is used to predict the best action while playing the game.

      "text" : "Value Functions are used for mapping from states or from state-action pairs to real numbers, where the value of a state represents the longterm reward achieved starting from that state (or\nstate-action), and executing a particular policy. It estimates how good a particular action will be in a given state, or what the return for that action is expected to be. There are two type of value functions.\n1. V π(s) is the value of a state ’s’ under policy π. The expected return when starting in s and following π thereafter.\n2. Qπ(s, a) is the value of taking action ’a’ in state ’s’ under a policy π. The expected return when starting from s taking the action a and thereafter following policy π.\nThere are two methods to define these value functions:\n1. Monte Carlo [1] Method : In this method the agent would need to wait until the final reward was received before any state-action pair values can be updated. Once the final reward is received, the path taken to reach the final state would need to be traced back and each value updated.\nV (st)← V (st) + α[Rt − V (st)] (1)\nwhere st is the state visited at time t, Rt is the reward after time t and α is a constant parameter.\n2. Temporal Difference [1] Method : It is used to estimate the value functions after each step. An estimate of the final reward is calculated at each state and the state-action value updated for every step of the way. This reflects a more realistic assignment of rewards to actions compared to MC, which updates all actions at the end directly. TD Learning is nothing but the combination of dynamic programming with the Monte Carlo method. The formula related to TD learning is given as\nV (st)← V (st)+α[rt+1+γV (st+1)−V (st)](2)\nwhere rt+1 is the observed reward at time t+1."

But, with a small probability , an action is selected at random to ensure optimal actions are discovered.\n2. −soft : Very similar to −greedy. The best action is selected with probability 1− and the rest of the time a random action is chosen uniformly.\n3. softmax : One drawback of the above methods is that they select random actions with some probability. So there is a case when the worst possible action is selected as the second best. Softmax remedies this\nby assigning a rank or weight to each of the actions, according to their action-value estimate. So the worst actions are unlikely to be chosen."

For γ = 0 all the upcoming rewards are ignored. For γ = 1 means the RL-Agent will consider the current and upcoming rewards as equal weightage.\n• Exploration Rate : In action selection policies there is one policy called as greedy method which uses the exploration rate 0 < < 1 for determining the ratio between the exploration and exploitation.

In our experiments we built RL agent for S3 game using relative reward function with the Q-learning and SARSA approach as discussed earlier. RL-agent learn by playing 10 games against built-in-ai called ai-catapult-rush for the simple map NWTR1 (refer Figure 12) using two approaches Q-Learning and SARSA. The state-action pair values (Q-Values) are updated while playing (or Learning as discussed earlier RL-Agent also learns while playing). Using this updated Q-Values RL-Agent plays games against ai-catapult-rush as well as another type of builtin-ai called ai-rush.\n• ai-catapult-rush is the built-in-ai that builds barracks and lumber-mills at the starting, this has two peasants for harvesting gold, and two for harvesting wood. Then it starts building catapults nonstop and also attacks after a while. After sometime it increases the number of peasants to 3, and starts building the second barrack. It also looks for goldmines where there gold\nis still available. Also, it sends catapults to attack enemies.\n• ai-rush is the built-in-ai that builds a barrack at the starting. There are two peasants at the starting for harvesting gold and wood. After building the barrack ai-rush trains the footmen. When there are two trained footmen it starts attacking.\nFor our experiment we used three type of maps (refer Figure 3, 1 and 12) according to difficulty level (easy-NWTR2, medium-NWTR6 and difficult-GOW). We performed our experiments with five games against two built-in-ai wherein the two approaches are Q-Learning and SARSA for each map. The comparison statistics are given in Table 1. We observed that RL-agent with SARSA wins most of the games. Q-Learning and the previous approach (Darmok2) [10] performs almost the same but not better than SARSA. For S3 also SARSA gives the best results.\nTable 1 shows the results comparison. By analyzing the results shown in Table 1 we can see that in most of the maps SARSA has won or drawn the game. The maps where it has lost we found that the built-in-ai was a quick attacker and RLagent was not able to produce enough number\nof troops to defend while the enemy was attacking. The RL agent was basically trying to find a way to enter through the wall of trees. In some maps we have shown the results as drawn. This means that resources like wood and gold of both player and enemy got finished and only peasants were left out at both the sides and they cannot do anything without the gold and wood.\nWhen compared to previous research on Darmok2 [10], where pre-prepared strategies are used to play the game and plan adaption module is used to switch strategies in this research RL-Agent quickly switches the strategies while playing, even though we used a simple map for training the RL-Agent."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper we proposed a reinforcement learning model for real-time strategy games. In order to achieve this end we make use of two reinforcement learning algorithms SARSA and QLearning. The idea is to get the best action using one of the RL algorithms so as to not make use of the traces generated by the players. In previous\nworks on real-time strategy games using ”on line case based learning” human traces form an important component in the learning process. In the proposed method we are not making use of any previous knowledge like traces and therefore we follow an unsupervised approach. This research is with regard to getting the best action using two algorithms (SARSA and Q-Learning) which comes under Reinforcement Learning without the traces generated by the player as proposed in the previous work ”on line case based learning” using Darmok2. Another major contribution of our work is the reward function. Rewards are calculated by two types of reward functions called conditional and generalized reward function. The sensor information related to game is used for calculating the rewards. The reward values are further used by the two RL algorithms\nSARSA and Q-Learning. These algorithms make policies according to the reward for the state-action pair. RL agent choose the action using these policies. We evaluated our approach successfully in two different game domains (BattleCity and S3) and observed that reinforcement learning performs better than previous ap-\nproaches in terms of learning time and winning ratio. In particular SARSA algorithm takes lesser time to learn and start winning very quickly than Q-Learning and that too for complex maps."

In our proposed method we use Q-learning and SARSA algorithms with generalised reward function to train the reinforcement learning agent. We evaluated the performance of our proposed algorithms on two real-time strategy games called BattleCity and S3. There are two main advantages of having such an approach as compared to other works in RTS. (1) We can ignore the concept of a simulator which is often game specific and is usually hard coded in any type of RTS games (2) our system can learn from interaction with any opponents and quickly change the strategy according to the opponents and do not need any human traces as used in previous works.",
