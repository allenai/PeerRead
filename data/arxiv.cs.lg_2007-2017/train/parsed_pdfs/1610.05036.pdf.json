      "text" : "In this work, we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity patterns of brain, using Fisher Vectors (FV), Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods. We first obtain local descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called brain connectivity dictionary by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture. Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the k-Means clustering. We classify the cognitive states of Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI dataset, where we train support vector machines (SVM) by the encoded MADs. Results demonstrate that, FV encoding of MADs can be successfully employed for classification of cognitive tasks, and outperform the VLAD and BoW representations. Moreover, we identify the significant Gaussians in mixture models by computing energy of their corresponding FV parts, and analyze their effect on classification accuracy. Finally, we suggest a new method to visualize the codewords of brain connectivity dictionary."

      "text" : "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool used for capturing the neural activation observed in a wide range of cognitive tasks encoded in brain. Traditional approaches employ fMRI Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response of voxels or anatomical regions for cognitive state classification (Haxby et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2004). Yet, recent findings show that connectivity between voxels or anatomical regions provides more information about activities in brain compared to the voxel BOLD responses. In addition, pairwise correlations between voxel BOLD responses are suggested to represent and classify cognitive tasks (Richiardi et al., 2011; Shirer et al., 2011). Pairwise global connectivity provides better classification performance compared to traditional approaches. Brain connectivity is also represented by a set of local meshes (Onal et al., 2015a,b), where relationships\n∗∗Corresponding author: Tel.: +90-555-557-9677; e-mail: itir@ceng.metu.edu.tr (Itir Onal Ertugrul)\namong multiple voxels are estimated within a predefined neighborhood. Estimated relationships, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (Ozay et al., 2012), are reported to give the best performance in cognitive state classification, compared to voxel BOLD responses and their pairwise relationships.\nEncoding approaches are widely used in pattern recognition literature to improve the representation power of local descriptors. In a popular encoding approach, called Bag-of-Words (BoW), first local descriptors are clustered using the k-means clustering method. Then, cluster centroids are defined as codewords to form a dictionary. Codewords are utilized as textual words in natural language processing, and visual words in image processing. In this approach, each descriptor is assigned to the closest codeword, and a sample is represented by a histogram of codewords, to which its local descriptors belong. BoW approach has been used to detect diseases using fMRI data (Solmaz et al., 2012), and to classify EEG time series data (Wang et al., 2013; Merino et al., 2013).\nIn another encoding approach, called Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), first, codewords are computed similar to BoW. However, VLAD aims to accumulate the dif-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 03\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n7 O\nct 2\n01 6\n2 ference between the codewords and local descriptors assigned to the codewords (Jégou et al., 2010). VLAD has been used in various applications including image (Delhumeau et al., 2013) and video (Abbas et al., 2015) processing, yet it has not been used to encode local descriptors obtained from fMRI data.\nFisher Vector (FV) encoding methods are employed for statistical data analysis by making use of the benefits of generative and discriminative models (Carvajal et al., 2016; Sánchez et al., 2013). FV encoding is considered as an extension of BoW such that, rather than encoding the relative frequency of the descriptors, it encodes the information on distribution of the descriptors (Perronnin et al., 2010). Fisher kernels have been used to compute FVs utilizing a mechanism that incorporates generative probability models into discriminative classifiers in applications, including classification of protein domains (Jaakkola et al., 1999), action and event recognition (Oneata et al., 2013; Sekma et al., 2015), image classification (Liu et al., 2014; Simonyan et al., 2013; Sánchez and Redolfi, 2015) and 3D object retrieval (Savelonas et al., 2016). FVs have been applied to model effective connectivity of the networks using MRI and PET data (Zhou et al., 2016). Yet, FVs have not been used to encode the connectivity patterns of fMRI data, which is very crucial to analyze the behavior of brain during cognitive tasks.\nThe major contribution of this study is to suggest a novel framework for encoding a set of local descriptors which models the connectivity patterns among the anatomic regions, based on the fMRI data. Inspired by the concept of visual words in image processing, our motivation is to generate a brain connectivity dictionary that represents relational patterns formed among anatomical regions in order to describe the cognitive states. The proposed framework enables us to examine various encoding methods such as FVs, VLAD and BoW for cognitive task classification. To our knowledge, our framework is the first that uses encoding methods to the connectivity analysis of fMRI data.\nIn order to generate the brain connectivity dictionary, we fit a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the set of MADs, obtained from all anatomic regions, and from all subjects, during all cognitive tasks. The mean vector of a Gaussian component corresponds to a codeword of brain connectivity dictionary. Then, by using the codewords, we encode MADs with FV, VLAD and BoW methods. In FV encoding, a generative model is estimated by fitting a Gaussian mixture to the MAD vectors. We represent each sample of a cognitive task, as a FV encoding to model the statistical deviation of the associated MAD from the corresponding GMMs. In VLAD, we cluster MADs using a kmeans clustering method and obtain a dictionary of MADs. We represent each sample by the accumulated difference between the MADs and the codewords to which they are assigned. For comparison, we also compute BoW models of MAD. We train linear SVM classifiers by the encoded MADs, obtained from BoW, VLAD and FV encoding methods. We observe that encoding MADs with FV provides the best performances and improves the performances of raw MADs in cognitive task classification. On the other hand, VLAD encoding provides similar performance to that of raw MADs. However, BoW encoding decreases the performance of raw MADs. Our results show\nthat the performance of SVM classifier heavily depends on the modality of the codewords, the dimension of feature vectors and degree of functional locality of meshes.\nAnother contribution of this work is the exploration of the relationship between energy of FV columns obtained from a particular Gaussian component and the classification accuracy. Our results reflect that Gaussian mixture components whose FV columns have higher energy are more discriminative compared to the ones with lower energy. Finally, we suggest a visualization method to depict and analyze codewords of the brain connectivity dictionary on a human brain template. We first sort the Gaussian mixture components based on the energy they provide for FV encoding. Then, we plot their codewords on brain, and sort them with respect to their discriminative power. The suggested framework is tested to classify the cognitive tasks in Human Connectomme Project (HCP). The results suggest that MADs having large values in the elements corresponding to occipital regions and low values in the rest of the elements, provide the most significant information to classify the cognitive tasks. On the other hand, MADs having large values in the elements corresponding to central structures (Putamen, Caudate and Thalamus) provide the least discriminative information."

Number of scans and their duration vary for each task, yet they have equal duration for all participants (see Table 1).\nWe use R = 98 regions of Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) brain atlas Tzourio-Mazoyer et al.

Then, for each region ri, we obtain a representative time series yi(t), ∀t, by spatially averaging the BOLD responses obtained from voxels residing in that region as follows:\nyi(t) = 1 Ji ∑ ∀v j∈ri x j(t),∀t, (1)\nwhere Ji is the number of voxels residing in the ith region ri, ∀i.\n3\nFig. 1: An overview of our proposed framework which is employed to generate a brain connectivity dictionary. For each cognitive task, we first form local meshes around all anatomical regions using their functionally nearest neighbors (in the figure, we represent only five representative meshes). Next, we estimate edge weights of meshes (MAD) for all tasks of all subjects. We apply PCA to reduce dimension of the MADs, and obtain uncorrelated descriptors. Then, we employ GMMs and k-means clustering methods on the descriptors using data obtained from all tasks. Finally, we obtain FV, VLAD and BoW encoding for each task."

      "text" : "Given a set of vectors, FV method encodes deviation of distribution of the vectors from a dictionary, which is typically described by a diagonal Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (Carvajal et al., 2016). In the proposed framework, our vectors are MADs obtained from fMRI data. We obtain a brain connectivity dictionary of MADs by modeling the features using a GMM. In order to satisfy the assumption of diagonal covariance matrix of GMM and obtain linearly uncorrelated features, we apply PCA to MADs. For simplicity, we use the same notation for MADs at the output of PCA, such that ai represents the projection of a MADs in a D-dimensional space.\nLet A = {ai ∈ RD}Ri=1 denote a set of D-dimensional MADs which are obtained from a single task of a single subject, and are sampled from the set of all MADs, A. Also, let uk be the kth component of GMM, which models the generative process for elements belonging to A. We denote the parameter set of all uk’s by λ = {wk,µk,Σk}Kk=1, where wk, µk and Σk are the mixture weight, mean vector and covariance matrix of the kth Gaussian, respectively. We compute the mixture uλ by\n4 uλ(ai) = K∑\nk=1 wkuk(ai), where uk(ai) denotes the kth Gaussian in\nthe mixture, and is computed by\nuk(ai) = 1\n(2π)D/2|Σk |1/2 exp\n( − 1\n2 (ai − µk)TΣ−1k (ai − µk)\n) . (3)\nWe estimate the parameters of GMM on a training set of MADs using Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We assume that diagonal covariance matrices are identified by σ2k which denotes a vector of the diagonal entries of Σ2k . Then, we compute the derivatives of log-likelihood of GMM with\nrespect to the parameters using GAλ = R −1 R∑ i=1 ∇λ log uλ(ai). The derivatives are only taken with respect to Gaussian means and variances, since the gradients computed with respect to the weight parameters, wi, provide less information (Perronnin et al., 2010). Therefore, we obtain a representation that captures the average first and second order differences between MADs and each of the GMM models. Then, we compute Ddimensional gradients using\nGAµk = 1\nR √\nwk R∑ i=1 γi(k) ( ai − µk σk ) (4)\nand\nGAσk = 1\nR √ 2wk R∑ i=1 γi(k)  (ai − µk)2 σ2k − 1  , (5)\nwhere γi(k) represents the soft assignment of the MAD vector ai to the kth Gaussian, and is defined by\nγi(k) = wkuk(ai) ( K∑\nl=1 wlul(ai)\n)−1 .\nA Fisher vector GAλ is obtained by concatenating the gradients under a vector GAλ = [ GAµ1 ,G A σ1 ,GAµ2 ,G A σ2 , . . . ,G A µK ,G A σK ] of size 2KD. We obtain Fisher Vectors for both training and test data. In order to obtain better accuracy, we further apply l2 normalization and square-root transformation on FVs as suggested in (Sánchez et al., 2013)."

Then, we use the encoded MAD vectors to train and test linear SVM classifiers. We measure the classification performance using a 10-fold cross validation (CV) scheme by randomly splitting the data into 10 subsets according to a uniform distribution, training each model on 9 splits, and testing the learned model on the remaining split. Note that, training and test splits contain data associated to different participants for each fold. In the proposed framework, we use only training data for implementation of all methods that are employed in learning phase, such as computation of PCA using MADs, estimation of Gaussian mixture models, kmeans clustering and training SVM classifiers. We examine the proposed methods for various number of neighbors p ∈ P = {10, 20, 30, 40}, in each mesh to observe the effect of degree of locality of the meshes. Considering the fact that MADs are R-dimensional vectors (before application of PCA), employment of smaller p values provides increased locality and sparser MAD vectors. Before employment of FV encoding, we project MADs onto d ∈ {50, 60, 70, 80, 90} dimensional spaces. Moreover, we select the number of Gaussians in GMM and the number of clusters in k-means using k ∈ {20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120}. We compute average performance of 10-fold CV for all k and d. Accuracy values denoted in Table 2 show maximum of these performances with respect to the values of k and d.\nResults given in Table 2 show that, FV encoding of MADs computed by employment of PCA (FV-MAD with PCA) gives the best performance to classify cognitive tasks compared to VLAD (VLAD-MAD) and BoW encoding (BoW-MAD). We observe that VLAD encoding of MADs does not increase the\n5\ndiscrimination power of MADs. Although accuracy values of VLAD-MAD are comparable with that of MAD, BoW representations of MADs yield substantial decrease in accuracy. In order to observe the representation power of MAD compared to popular fMRI representation methods, we use average voxel BOLD responses and Pearson correlation pairs between them as the input feature vectors of SVM classifiers. When the average region BOLD responses are employed for classification, we obtain almost chance accuracy (14.29%). On the other hand, when pairwise correlations between all pairs of region BOLD responses are used as features, we obtain a classification accuracy of 77.49%. In Table 3, we observe a substantial increase (10 − 15%) obtained by representing fMRI data by MADs. These observations show the power of MADs for representation of the connectivity of anatomic regions.\nNext, we examine the success of encoding for each cognitive task. We observe in Fig. 2 that the accuracy values obtained for Gambling and Relational Processing tasks are lower compared to the other tasks performed using FV-MAD and VLADMAD. However, accuracy values obtained from BoW-MAD for\nall classes are low, meaning that BoW is not successful to encode MADs. When we compare the results shown in Fig. 2a, Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, we observe that we can boost the accuracy for Emotion and WM tasks compared to concatenated MADs by encoding MADs with FV and VLAD. Yet, the accuracy is decreased for Gambling task, especially for the lower values of p.\nWe also analyze the effect of employment of PCA to local MADs before computation of FV encoding. Our results verify the observation that dimension reduction using PCA is a key method used to boost the performance (see Table 2). We also observe from Table 2 that without PCA, FV encoding cannot improve the performance of concatenated MADs for any value of p. Similarly, we observe that performance decreases if we do\n6 Codeword1 Codeword2 Codeword3 Codeword4 Codeword5 Codeword6 Codeword7\nCodeword8 Codeword9 Codeword10 Codeword11 Codeword12 Codeword13 Codeword14\nCodeword15 Codeword16 Codeword17 Codeword18 Codeword19 Codeword20\nFig. 4: Codewods of brain connectivity dictionary obtained by FVs for encoding of MADs with p = 40.

We examine how accuracy changes as dimension of MAD is decreased using PCA in Fig. 3 by plotting the average accuracy obtained over all values of k for different d ∈ {50, 60, . . . , 90}. We observe that, if the dimension d of the low-dimensional space obtained using PCA increases, then average accuracy may increase. Moreover, without dimension reduction, the average accuracy decreases for most of the p ∈ P values."

      "text" : "In this subsection, we explore the contribution of a particular codeword (component of GMM) to classify the cognitive tasks by measuring the energy (Euclidean norm) of the corresponding\ncolumns of FVs. Recall that, the columns of the kth Gaussian in a FV encoding is [GAµK ,G A σK ] for a set A of MADs. If we denote the corresponding columns of the kth Gaussian in the FV encoding using all training data by Gk = [GµK ,GσK ], then the energy is measured by the Euclidean norm ‖Gk‖2. We denote a Gaussian whose FV columns have the lowest energy by GLE, and the one whose FV columns have the highest energy by GHE.\nNext, we visualize R-dimensional codewords obtained from MADs without using PCA. Each codeword corresponds to a mesh pattern formed around a seed voxel. Large values of codeword elements represent that, a MAD formed between the region corresponding to the codeword element and seed region has large value. Similarly, small values of codeword elements indicate small values of MADs between seed region and the corresponding region. As an example, we plot codewords for p = 40 and k = 20, in Fig. 4. Notice from Figure 4 that, codewords represent different mesh patterns. For example, Codeword1 represents a mesh pattern in which MADs formed between a seed region and regions residing in the occipital lobe have large values while MADs formed between a seed region and the other regions have smaller values. Recall that, each GMM component obtained without using PCA corresponds to 2R columns of FVs. In Fig. 4, we provide visualization of the Gaussians in an order from GHE to GLE by plotting the codewords of the corresponding Gaussians. The results show that codeword of GHE has large values mainly in the occipital lobe. On the other hand, codeword of GLE has large values in central structures including Caudate, Putamen and Thalamus.\n7\nSimonyan et al. (2013) showed that GHEs represent the facial features whereas the GLEs cover the background areas. In other words, they stated that GHEs are significant for comparing human face images. Following our results, we conjecture that the GHEs consisting of MADs convey class (task) discriminative information. In order to validate this assumption, and investigate the relationship between the energy of FV columns related to Gaussians and the classification accuracy, we employ an energy based feature selection scheme for FV encoding. For this purpose, we select and remove the corresponding columns from FVs, and perform classification. When we remove FV columns with minimum and maximum energy, we observe that the accuracy decreases slightly and significantly, respectively (see Fig. 5). We conclude that, GHEs provide more class (task) discrimination power to classifiers compared to GLEs."

Moreover, FV encoding improves the performance of models that employ MADs. We also observe that statistical decorrelation of MADs obtained using PCA is a significant step for FV encoding. We further analyze class (task) discrimination power of Gaussians obtained from FV encoding. We observe a relationship between the energy of FV columns corresponding to Gaussians and classification accuracy. Following that result, we visualize codewords of brain connectivity dictionary on a human brain template according to their discriminative power, which is measured by an energy function.\nIn this work, we constructed mesh structures of anatomical regions.

We first obtain local descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called brain connectivity dictionary by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture. Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the k-Means clustering. We classify the cognitive states of Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI dataset, where we train support vector machines (SVM) by the encoded MADs. Results demonstrate that, FV encoding of MADs can be successfully employed for classification of cognitive tasks, and outperform the VLAD and BoW representations. Moreover, we identify the significant Gaussians in mixture models by computing energy of their corresponding FV parts, and analyze their effect on classification accuracy. Finally, we suggest a new method to visualize the codewords of brain connectivity dictionary.",
