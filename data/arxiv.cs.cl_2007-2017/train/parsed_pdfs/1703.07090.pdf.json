      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Recently, deep neural network has been widely employed in various recognition tasks. Increasing the depth of neural network is a effective way to improve the performance, and convolutional neural network (CNN) has benefited from it in visual recognition task[1]. Deeper long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are also applied in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) task, because LSTM networks have shown better performance than Fully-connected feed-forward deep neural network[2, 3, 4, 5].\nTraining neural network becomes more challenge when it goes deep. A conceptual tool called linear classifier probe is introduced to better understand the dynamics inside a neural network [6]. The discriminating features of linear classifier is the hidden units of a intermediate layer. For deep neural networks, it is observed that deeper layer’s accuracy is lower\nthan that of shallower layers. Therefore, the tool shows the difficulty of deep neural model training visually.\nLayer-wise pre-training is a successful method to train very deep neural networks [7]. The convergence becomes harder with increasing the number of layers, even though the model is initialized with Xavier or its variants [8, 9]. But the deeper network which is initialized with a shallower trained network could converge well.\nThe size of LVCSR training dataset goes larger and training with only one GPU becomes high time consumption inevitably. Therefore, parallel training with multi-GPUs is more suitable for LVCSR system. Mini-batch based stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the most popular method in neural network training procedure. Asynchronous SGD is a successful effort for parallel training based on it [10, 11]. It can many times speed up the training time without decreasing the accuracy. Besides, synchronous SGD is another effective effort, where the parameter server waits for every works to finish their computation and sent their local models to it, and then it sends updated model back to all workers [12]. Synchronous SGD convergeswell in parallel training with data parallelism, and is also easy to implement.\nIn order to further improve the performance of deep neural network with parallel training, several methods are proposed. Model averaging method achieves linear speedup, as the final model is averaged from all parameters of local models in different workers [13, 14], but the accuracy decreases compared with single GPU training. Moreover, blockwise model-updating filter (BMUF) provides another almost linear speedup approach with multi-GPUs on the basis of model averaging. It can achieve improvement or no-degradation of recognition performance compared with mini-batch SGD on single GPU [15].\nMoving averaged (MA) approaches are also proposed for parallel training. It is demonstrated that the moving average of the parameters obtained by SGD performs as well as the parameters that minimize the empirical cost, and moving average parameters can be used as the estimator of them, if the size of training data is large enough [16]. One pass learning is then proposed, which is the combination of learning rate schedule and averaged SGD using moving average [17]. Exponential moving average (EMA) is proposed as a noninterference method[18]. EMA model is not broadcasted to\nworkers to update their local models, and it is applied as the final model of entire training process. EMA method is utilized with model averaging and BMUF to further decrease the character error rate (CER). It is also easy to implement in existing parallel training systems.\nFrame stacking can also speed up the training time [19]. The super frame is stacked by several regular frames, and it contains the information of them. Thus, the network can see multiple frames at a time, as the super frame is new input. Frame stacking can also lead to faster decoding.\nFor streaming voice search service, it needs to display intermediate recognition results while users are still speaking. As a result, the system needs to fulfill high real-time requirement, and we prefer unidirectional LSTM network rather than bidirectional one. High real-time requirement means low real time factor (RTF), but the RTF of deep LSTMmodel is higher inevitably. The dilemma of recognition accuracy and realtime requirement is an obstacle to the employment of deep LSTM network. Deep model outperforms because it contains more knowledge, but it is also cumbersome. As a result, the knowledge of deep model can be distilled to a shallow model [20]. It provided a effective way to employ the deep model to the real-time system.\nIn this paper, we explore a entire deep LSTM RNN training framework, and employ it to real-time application. The deep learning systems benefit highly from a large quantity of labeled training data. Our first and basic speech recognition system is trained on 17000 hours of Shenma voice search dataset. It is a generic dataset sampled from diverse aspects of search queries. The requirement of speech recognition system also addressed by specific scenario, such as map and navigation task. The labeled dataset is too expensive, and training a new model with new large dataset from the beginning costs lots of time. Thus, it is natural to think of transferring the knowledge from basic model to new scenario’s model. Transfer learning expends less data and less training time than full training. In this paper, we also introduce a novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk (sMBR). As a result, transfer training with only 1000 hours data can match equivalent performance for full training with 7300 hours data.\nOur deep LSTM training framework for LVCSR is presented in Section 2. Section 3 describes how the very deep models does apply in real world applications, and how to transfer the model to another task. The framework is analyzed and discussed in Section 4, and followed by the conclusion in Section 5."

      "text" : "Gradient-based optimization of deep LSTM network with random initialization get stuck in poor solution easily. Xavier initialization can partially solve this problem [8], so this method is the regular initialization method of all training procedure. However, it does not work well when it is utilized to initialize very deep model directly, because of vanishing or exploding gradients. Instead, layer-wise pre-training method is a effective way to train the weights of very deep architecture[7, 21]. In layer-wise pre-training procedure, a one-layer LSTM model is firstly trained with normalized initialization. Sequentially, two-layers LSTMmodel’s first layer is initialized by trained one-layer model, and its second layer is regularly initialized. In this way, a deep architecture is layer-by-layer trained, and it can converge well.\nIn conventional layer-wise pre-training, only parameters of shallower network are transfered to deeper one, and the learning targets are still the alignments generated by HMMGMM system. The targets are vectors that only one state’s probability is one, and the others’ are zeros. They are known as hard targets, and they carry limited knowledge as only one state is active. In contrast, the knowledge of shallower network should be also transfered to deeper one. It is obtained by the softmax layer of existing model typically, so each state has a probability rather than only zero or one, and called as soft target. As a result, the deeper network which is student network learns the parameters and knowledge from shallower one which is called teacher network. When training the student network from the teacher network, the final alignment is the combination of hard target and soft target in our layerwise training phase. The final alignment provides various knowledge which transfered from teacher network and extracted from true labels. If only soft target is learned, student network perform no better than teacher network, but it could outperform teacher network as it also learns true labels.\nThe deeper network spends less time to getting the same level of original network than the network trained from the beginning, as a period of low performance is skipped. Therefore, training with hard and soft target is a time saving method. For large training dataset, training with the whole dataset still spends too much time. A network firstly trained with only a small part of dataset could go deeper as well, and so the training time reducing rapidly. When the network is deep enough, it then trained on the entire dataset to get further improvement. There is no gap of accuracy between these two approaches, but latter one saves much time."

If the differentials go beyond the range, corresponding back propagation is skipped, while if the gradients and cell activations go beyond the bound, values are set as the boundary values. The differentials which are too large or too small will lead to the gradients easily vanishing, and it demonstrates the failure of this propagation.

We choose state-level minimum bayes risk (sMBR)[22] among a number of sequence discriminative criterion is proposed, such as maximum mutual information (MMI) [25] and minimum phone error (MPE) [26]. MPE and sMBR are designed to minimize the expected error of different granularity of labels, while CE aims to minimizes expected frame error, and MMI aims to minimizes expected sentence error. State-level information is focused on by sMBR.\na frame-level accurate model is firstly trained by CE loss function, and then sMBR loss function is utilized for further training to get sequence-level accuracy.

Block-wise model updating filter (BMUF) is another successful effort in parallel training with linear speedup as well. It can achieve no-degradation of recognition accuracy with multi-GPUs [15]. In the model average method, aggregated model θ̄(t) is computed and\nbroadcasted to GPUs. On the basis of it, BMUF proposed a novel model updating strategy:\nθ̄(t) = 1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\nθi\nG(t) = θ̄(t)− θg(t− 1)\n∆(t) = ηt∆(t− 1) + ζtG(t)\nWhere G(t) denotes model update, and ∆(t) is the globalmodel update. There are two parameters in BMUF, block momentum η, and block learning rate ζ. Then, the global model is updated as\nθg(t) = θg(t− 1) + ∆(t)\nConsequently, θg(t) is broadcasted to all GPUs to initial their local models, instead of θ̄(t) in model average method."

Averaged SGD leverages the moving average (MA) θ̄ as the estimator of θ∗ [16]:\nθ̄t = 1\nt\nt∑\nτ=1\nθτ\nWhere θτ is computed by model averaging or BMUF. It is shown that θ̄t can well converge to θ ∗, with the large enough training dataset in single GPU training. It can be considered as a non-interference strategy that θ̄t does not participate the main optimization process, and only takes effect after the end of entire optimization. However, for the parallel training implementation, each θτ is computed by model averaging and BMUF with multiple models, and moving average model θ̄t does not well converge, compared with single GPU training.\nModel averaging based methods are employed in parallel training of large scale dataset, because of their faster convergence, and especially no-degradation implementation of BMUF. But combination of model averaged based methods and moving average does not match the expectation of further enhance performance and it is presented as\nθ̄gt = 1\nt\nt∑\nτ=1\nθgτ\nThe weight of each θgt is equal in moving average method regardless the effect of temporal order. But t closer to the end of training achieve higher accuracy in the model averaging based approach, and thus it should be with more proportion in final θ̄g. As a result, exponential moving average(EMA) is appropriate, which the weight for each older parameters decrease exponentially, and never reaching zero. After moving\naverage based methods, the EMA parameters are updated recursively as\nθ̂gt = αθ̂gt−1 + (1− α)θgt\nHere α represents the degree of weight decrease, and called exponential updating rate. EMA is also a non-interference training strategy that is implemented easily, as the updated model is not broadcasted. Therefore, there is no need to add extra learning rate updating approach, as it can be appended to existing training procedure directly."

If it can be transfered from cumbersome model to a small model, the recognition ability can also be transfered to the small model. Knowledge transferring to small model is called distillation [20]. The small model can perform as well as cumbersome model, after distilling. It provide a way to utilize high-performance but high RTF model in real time system. The class probability produced by the cumbersome model is regarded as soft target, and the generalization ability of cumbersome model is transfered to small model with it. Distillation is model’s knowledge transferring approach, so there is no need to use the hard target, which is different with the layer-wise training method."

If a model transfer trained with smaller dataset can obtained the similar recognition accuracy compared with the model directly trained with larger dataset, it is no doubt that transfer learning is more practical. Since specific scenario is\na subset of generic scenario, some knowledge can be shared between them. Besides, generic scenario consists of various conditions, so its model has greater robustness. As a result, not only shared knowledge but also robustness can be transfered from the model of generic scenario to the model of specific one.\nAs the model well trained from generic scenario achieves good performance in frame level classification, sequence discriminative training is required to adapt new model to specific scenario additionally.

Shenma and Amap voice search is a streaming service that intermediate recognition results displayed while users are still speaking. So as for online recognition in real time, we prefer unidirectional LSTM model rather than bidirectional one. Thus, the training system is unidirectional LSTM-based.\nA 26-dimensional filter bank and 2-dimensional pitch feature is extracted for each frame, and is concatenated with first and second order difference as the final input of the network. The super frame are stacked by 3 frames without overlapping. The architecture we trained consists of two LSTM layers with sigmoid activation function, followed by a fullconnection layer. The out layer is a softmax layer with 11088 hidden markov model (HMM) tied-states as output classes, the loss function is cross-entropy (CE). The performancemetric of the system in Mandarin is reported with character error rate (CER). The alignment of frame-level ground truth is obtained by GMM-HMM system. Mini-batched SGD is utilized with momentum trick and the network is trained for a total of 4 epochs. The block learning rate and block momentum of BMUF are set as 1 and 0.9. 5-gram language model is leveraged in decoder, and the vocabulary size is as large as 760000. Differentials of recurrent layers is limited to range [-10000,10000], while gradients are clipped to range [-5, 5] and cell activations clipped to range [-50, 50]. After training with CE loss, sMBR loss is employed to further improve the performance.\nIt has shown that BMUF outperforms traditional model averaging method, and it is utilized at the synchronization phase. After synchronizing with BMUF, EMA method further updates the model in non-interference way. The training system is deployed on the MPI-based HPC cluster where 8 GPUs. Each GPU processes non-overlap subset split from the entire large scale dataset in parallel.\nLocal models from distributed workers synchronize with each other in decentralized way. In the traditional model averaging and BMUF method, a parameter server waits for all workers to send their local models, aggregate them, and send the updated model to all workers. Computing resource of workers is wasted until aggregation of the parameter server done. Decentralized method makes full use of computing resource, and we employ the MPI-based Mesh AllReduce method. It is mesh topology as shown in Figure 1. There is no centralized parameter server, and peer to peer communication is used to transmit local models between workers. Local model θi of i-th worker in N workers cluster is split to N pieces θi,j j = 1 · · ·N , and send to corresponding worker. In the aggregation phase, j-th worker computed N splits of model θi,j i = 1 · · ·N and send updated model θ̄gj back to\nworkers. As a result, all workers participate in aggregation and no computing resource is dissipated. It is significant to promote training efficiency, when the size of neural network model is too large.

In our framework, 1000 hours data is randomly selected from\nthe total dataset for sMBR training. There is no obvious performance enhancement when the size of sMBR training dataset increases.\nFor very deep unidirectional LSTM initialized with Xavier initialization algorithm, 6-layers model converges well, but there is no further improvement with increasing the number of layers. Therefore, the first 6 layers of 7-layers model is initialized by 6-layers model, and soft target is provided by 6-layers model. Consequently, deeper LSTM is also trained in the same way. It should be noticed that the teacher model of 9-layers model is the 8-layers model trained by sMBR, while the other teacher model is CE model. As shown in Table 2, the layer-wise trained models always performs better than the models with Xavier initialization, as the model is deep. Therefore, for the last layer training, we choose 8-layers sMBR model as the teacher model instead of CE model. A comparison between 6-layers and 9-layers sMBR models shows that 3 additional layers of layer-wise training brings relative 12.6% decreasing of CER.

Deeper LSTM models perform well on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, because of their impressive learning ability. However, it is more difficult to train a deeper network. We introduce a training framework with layer-wise training and exponential moving average methods for deeper LSTM models. It is a competitive framework that LSTM models of more than 7 layers are successfully trained on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin and they outperform the deep LSTM models trained by conventional approach. Moreover, in order for online streaming speech recognition applications, the shallow model with low real time factor is distilled from the very deep model. The recognition accuracy have little loss in the distillation process. Therefore, the model trained with the proposed training framework reduces relative 14% character error rate, compared to original model which has the similar real-time capability. Furthermore, the novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk is also introduced in the framework. The strategy makes it possible that training with only a small part of dataset could outperform full dataset training from the beginning.",
