However, most models do not take into account the fact that the effects of clutter interact with the foveated nature of the human visual system: visual clutter further from the fovea has an increasing detrimental influence on perception. Here, we introduce a new foveated clutter model to predict the detrimental effects in target search utilizing a forced fixation search task. We use Feature Congestion (Rosenholtz et al.) as our non foveated clutter model, and we stack a peripheral architecture on top of Feature Congestion for our foveated model. We introduce the Peripheral Integration Feature Congestion (PIFC) coefficient, as a fundamental ingredient of our model that modulates clutter as a non-linear gain contingent on eccentricity. We finally show that Foveated Feature Congestion (FFC) clutter scores r(44) = -0.82 correlate better with target detection (hit rate) than regular Feature Congestion r(44) = -0.19 in forced fixation search. Thus, our model allows us to enrich clutter perception research by computing fixation specific clutter maps. A toolbox for creating peripheral architectures: Piranhas: Peripheral Architectures for Natural, Hybrid and Artificial Systems will be made available.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 01:07:29 GMT  (6782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04042v1", "Pre-Print to be presented at NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "Pre-Print to be presented at NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["arturo deza", "miguel p eckstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04042"}
