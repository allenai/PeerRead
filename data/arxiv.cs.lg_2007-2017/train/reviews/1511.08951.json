Most often in the supervised learning to rank literature, ranking is approached either by analyzing pairs of images or by optimizing a list-wise surrogate loss function on full sequences. In this work we propose MidRank, which learns from moderately sized sub-sequences instead. These sub-sequences contain useful structural ranking information that leads to better learnability during training and better generalization during testing. By exploiting sub-sequences, the proposed MidRank improves ranking accuracy considerably on an extensive array of image ranking applications and datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 00:47:19 GMT  (538kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08951v1", "To appear in ICCV 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ICCV 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["basura fernando", "efstratios gavves", "damien muselet", "tinne tuytelaars"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08951"}
