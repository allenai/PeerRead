      "text" : "Since first proposed by Dempster [1], and then developed by Shafer [2], the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, which is also called Dempster-Shafer theory or evidence theory, has been paid much attentions for a long time and continually attracted growing interests. Even as a theory of reasoning under the uncertain environment, Dempster-Shafer theory has an advantage of directly expressing the “uncertainty ”by assigning the probability to the subsets of the set composed of multiple objects, rather than to each of the individual objects, so it has been widely used in many fields [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].\nDue to improve the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, many studies have been devoted for combination rule of evidence [15, 16, 10, 17, 18], confliction problem [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], generation of mass function [24, 25, 26, 27, 28], uncertain measure of evidence [29, 30, 31, 32], and so on [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]. One open issue of evidence theory is the decision making based on the basic probability assignments, many works have been done to construct a reasonable model for the decision making [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45].\nIn the transferable belief model (TBM) [40], pignistic probabilities are used for decision making. The transferable belief model is presented to represent quantified beliefs based on belief functions. TBM was constructed by two levels. The credal level where beliefs are entertained and quantified by belief functions. The pignistic level where beliefs can be used to\nmake decisions and are quantified by probability functions. The main idea of the pignistic probability transformation is to transform the multi-elements subsets into singleton subsets by an average method. Though the pignistic probability transformation is widely used, it can not describe the unknown for the multi-elements subsets. Hense, a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation called multiscale probability transformation of basic probability assignment is proposed in this paper, which is based on the belief function and the plausibility function. The proposed function can be calculated with the difference between the belief function and the plausibility function, we call it multiscale probability function and denote it as a function MulP . In the multiscale probability function, a factor q based on the Tsallis entropy [46] is used to make the multiscale probabilities diversified. When the value of q equals to 0, the proposed multiscale probability transformation can be degenerated as the pignistic probability transformation.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic Preliminaries about the Dempster-Shafer theory and the pignistic probability transformation. In section 3 the multiscale probability transformation is presented. Section 4 uses an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the multiscale probability transformation. Conclusion is given in Section 5."

      "text" : "Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence [1, 2], also called Dempster-Shafer theory or evidence theory, is used to deal with uncertain information. As\nan effective theory of evidential reasoning, Dempster-Shafer theory has an advantage of directly expressing various uncertainties. This theory needs weaker conditions than bayesian theory of probability, so it is often regarded as an extension of the bayesian theory. For completeness of the explanation, a few basic concepts are introduced as follows.\nDefinition 1. Let Ω be a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, indicted by\nΩ = {E1, E2, · · · , Ei, · · · , EN} (1)\nThe set Ω is called frame of discernment. The power set of Ω is indicated by 2Ω, where\n2Ω = {∅, {E1}, · · · , {EN}, {E1, E2}, · · · , {E1, E2, · · · , Ei}, · · · ,Ω} (2)\nIf A ∈ 2Ω, A is called a proposition.\nDefinition 2. For a frame of discernment Ω, a mass function is a mapping m from 2Ω to [0, 1], formally defined by:\nm : 2Ω → [0, 1] (3)\nwhich satisfies the following condition:\nm(∅) = 0 and ∑\nA∈2Ω\nm(A) = 1 (4)\nIn Dempster-Shafer theory, a mass function is also called a basic probability assignment (BPA). If m(A) > 0, A is called a focal element, the union of all focal elements is called the core of the mass function.\nDefinition 3. For a proposition A ⊆ Ω, the belief function Bel : 2Ω → [0, 1] is defined as\nBel(A) = ∑\nB⊆A\nm(B) (5)\nThe plausibility function P l : 2Ω → [0, 1] is defined as\nP l(A) = 1−Bel(Ā) = ∑\nB∩A 6=∅\nm(B) (6)\nwhere Ā = Ω−A.\nObviously, P l(A) ≥ Bel(A), these functions Bel and P l are the lower\nlimit function and upper limit function of proposition A, respectively."

      "text" : "signment\nIn the transferable belief model (TBM) [40], pignistic probabilities are used for decision making. The transferable belief model is presented to represent quantified beliefs based on belief functions. The main idea of the pignistic probability transformation is to transform the multi-elements subsets into singleton subsets by an average method. Though the pignistic probability transformation is widely used, it is not reasonable in the Example 1.\nExample 1. Suppose there is a frame of discernment of a, b, c, the BPA\nis given as follows.\nm({a}) = 0.2, m({b}) = 0.7, m({b, c}) = 0.05, m({a, b, c}) = 0.05. In the pignistic probability transformation, for m({a, b, c}) = 0.05, the result will be a = b = c = 0.05/3. Actually it is not reasonable, m({a, b, c}) = 0.05 means the sensor can not judge the target belongs to which classes, it represents a meaning of “unknown ”. In other word, only according to m({a, b, c}) = 0.05, nothing can be obtained except “unknown ”. In this situation, average is used in the pignistic probability transformation, which is one of the methods to solve the problem. Compared with the average, weighted average is more reasonable in many situations. In this paper, the weighted average is represented by the difference between the belief function and the plausibility function, whose definition is shown as follows.\nDefinition 5. Let m be a BPA on the frame of discernment Ω. The differ-\nence function dm is defined as:\ndm(ω) = P l(ω)−Bel(ω), ω ∈ Ω (8)\nDefinition 6. The weight is defined as:\nWeightm(ω) = dm(ω)\n|A| ∑\nα∈A\ndm(α)\n, ω ∈ A,A ⊆ P (Ω) (9)\nBased on the weighted average idea, a factor q, which is proposed in the Tsallis entropy [46], is used to highlight the weights. Thus, the definition of multiscale probability function MulP is shown as follows.\nDefinition 7. Letm be a BPA on the frame of discernment Ω. Its associated multiscale probability function MulPm : Ω → [0, 1] on Ω is defined as:\nMulPm(ω) = ∑\nA⊆P (Ω),ω∈A\n\n   \n(P l(ω)− Bel(ω))q\n|A| ∑\nα∈A\n(P l(α)−Bel(α))q\nm(A)\n1−m(φ)\n\n    , m(φ) 6= 1\n(10)\nwhere |W | is the cardinality of subset A. q is a factor based on the Tsallis entropy to amend the proportion of the interval. The transformation between m and MulPm is called the multiscale probability transformation.\nActually, the part of the Eq. 10 (P l(ω)−Bel(ω)) q\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))q\ndenotes the weight of\nelement ω based on normalization, which is replaced the averaged 1 |W | in the pignistic probability function.\nTheorem 3.1: Let m be a BPA on the frame of discernment Ω. Its associated multiscale probability MulPm on Ω is degenerated as the pignistic probability BetPm when q equals to 0.\nProof: When q equals to 0, (P l(ω)− Bel(ω))q equals to 1, the multiscale\nprobability function will be calculated as follows:\nMulPm(ω) = ∑\nA⊆Ω,ω∈A\n\n    1 |A| ∑\nα∈A\n1\n· mΩ(W )\n(1−mΩ(φ))\n\n    , ∀ω ∈ Ω (11)\nThen, it can obtain:\nMulPm(ω) = ∑\nA⊆Ω,ω∈A\n(\n1\n|A| ·\nmΩ(A)\n(1−mΩ(φ))\n)\n, ∀ω ∈ Ω (12)\nFrom Eq. 11 and Eq. 12, we can see that when the value of q equals to 0, the proposed multiscale probability function can be degenerated as the pignistic probability function.\nTheorem 3.2: Let m be a BPA on the frame of discernment Ω. If the belief function equals to the plausibility function, its associated multiscale probability MulPm on is degenerated as the pignistic probability BetPm.\nProof: Given a BPA m on the frame of discernment Ω, for each ω ∈ Ω, when the belief function equals to the plausibility function, namely Bel(ω) = P l(ω), the bel is a probability distribution P [40], then MulP is equal to BetP.\nFor example, let Ω be a frame of discernment and Ω = {a, b, c}, if it satisfies with Bel(a) = P l(a), Bel(b) = P l(b), Bel(c) = P l(c), the BPA on the frame must be satisfied with m(a) +m(b) +m(c) = 1. In this situation, the multiscale probability will be degenerated as the pignistic probability.\nCorollary: If bel is a probability distribution P, then MulP is equal to\nP.\nTheorem 3.3: Let m be a BPA on the frame of discernment Ω = a, b, c. If the differences between the belief function and the plausibility function is the same, the multiscale probability transformation can be degenerated as the pignistic probability transformation.\nProof: The same as the proof of theorem 3.1. An illustrative example is given to show the calculation of the multiscale\nprobability transformation step by step.\nExample 2. Let Ω be a frame of discernment with 3 elements. We use a, b, c to denote element 1, element 2, and element 3 in the frame. One body of BPA is given as follows:\nm({a}) = 0.2, m({b}) = 0.3, m({c}) = 0.1, m({a, b}) = 0.1, m({a, b, c}) = 0.3. Step 1 Based on Eq. 5 and Eq. 6, the values of the belief function and\nthe plausibility function of elements a, b, c can be obtained as follows:\nBel(a) = 0.2, P l(a) = 0.6, Bel(b) = 0.3, P l(b) = 0.7, Bel(c) = 0.1, P l(c) = 0.4. Step 2 Calculate the difference between the belief function and the plau-\nsibility function:\ndm(a) = P l(a)−Bel(a) = 0.6− 0.2 = 0.4, dm(b) = P l(b)− Bel(b) = 0.7− 0.3 = 0.4, dm(c) = P l(c)− Bel(c) = 0.4− 0.1 = 0.3. Step 3 Calculate the weight of each element in Ω. Assumed that the\nvalue of q equals to 1.\nWhen A = {a, b}, Weightm(a) = (P l(a)−Bel(a))\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))\n= 0.4/(0.4 + 0.4) = 0.5,\nWeightm(b) = (P l(b)−Bel(b))\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))\n= 0.4/(0.4 + 0.4) = 0.5.\nWhen W = {a, b, c}, Weightm(a) = (P l(a)−Bel(a))\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))\n= 0.4/(0.4 + 0.4 + 0.3) = 0.364,\nWeightm(b) = (P l(b)−Bel(b))\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))\n= 0.4/(0.4 + 0.4 + 0.3) = 0.364,\nWeightm(c) = (P l(c)−Bel(c))\n|W |∑\nα∈W (P l(α)−Bel(α))\n= 0.3/(0.4 + 0.4 + 0.3) = 0.272.\nStep 4 The value of the multiscale probability function can be obtained\nbased on above steps.\nMulPm(a) = 0.2 + 0.1 ∗ 0.5 + 0.3 ∗ 0.364 = 0.3592, MulPm(b) = 0.3 + 0.1 ∗ 0.5 + 0.3 ∗ 0.364 = 0.4592, MulPm(c) = 0.1 + 0.3 ∗ 0.272 = 0.1816."

      "text" : "In this section, an illustrative example is given to show the effection of\nthe multiscale probability function when the value of q changes.\nExample 3. Let Ω be a frame of discernment with 3 elements, namely\nΩ = {a, b, c}.\nGiven one body of BPAs: m({a}) = 0.3, m({b}) = 0.1, m({a, b}) = 0.1, m({a, c}) = 0.2, m({a, b, c}) = 0.3. Based on the pignistic probability transformation, the results of the pig-\nnistic probability function is shown as follows:\nBetPm(a) = 0.55, BetPm(b) = 0.25, BetPm(c) = 0.20. According to the proposed function in this paper, the results of the mul-\ntiscale probability function can be obtained through the follow steps.\nFirstly, the values of belief function and the plausibility function can be\nobtained as follows:\nBel(a) = 0.3, P l(a) = 0.9, Bel(b) = 0.1, P l(b) = 0.5, Bel(c) = 0, P l(c) = 0.5. Then, the differences between the belief functions and the plausibility\nfunctions can be calculated:\ndm(a) = P l(a)−Bel(a) = 0.6− 0.2 = 0.6, dm(b) = P l(b)− Bel(b) = 0.7− 0.3 = 0.4,\ndm(c) = P l(c)− Bel(c) = 0.4− 0.1 = 0.5. Based on the definition of the multiscale probability transformation, the values of MulPm can be obtained. There are 20 cases where the values of q starting from Case 1 with q = 0 and ending with Case 11 when q = 10 as shown in Table 1. The values of MulPm for these 20 cases is detailed in Table 1 and graphically illustrated in Fig. 1.\nAccording to the Table 1 and the Fig. 1, on one hand, when the value of q increased, the probability of the element which has larger weight is increased,\nand the probability of the element which has smaller weight is decreased. For example, the element a starting with probability 0.5500, and ending with probability 0.8250. The element b starting with probability 0.2500, and ending with probability 0.1061.\nOn the other hand, according to the Table 1, the option ranking of the the values of MulPm can be obtained. It is starting with MulPm(a) ≻ MulPm(b) ≻ MulPm(c), and ending withMulPm(a) ≻ MulPm(c) ≻ MulPm(b). It is mainly becauseMulPm is impact of the values of q. This principle makes the multiscale probability function has the ability to highlight the proportion of each element in the frame of discernment.\nNote that when the value of q equals to 0, the values of pignistic probability BetPm is the same as the values of multiscale probability MulPm, which is proposed in this paper. In other word, the multiscale probability function is a generalization of the pignistic probability function."

In the transferable belief model (TBM), pignistic probabilities based on the basic probability assignments are used for decision making. In this paper, multiscale probability transformation of basic probability assignment based on the belief function and the plausibility function is proposed, which is a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation. In the multiscale probability function, a factor q based on the Tsallis entropy is used to make the multiscale probabilities diversified. An example is shown that the multiscale probability transformation is more reasonable in the decision making.",
