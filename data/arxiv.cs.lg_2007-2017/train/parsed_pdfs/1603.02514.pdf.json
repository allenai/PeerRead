      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data for training. Classification using semi-supervised learning is a critical problem to be tackled since the data size nowadays is increasing much more faster than before, while only a limited subset of data samples has their corresponding labels. Hence lots of attention has been drawn from researchers over machine learning and deep learning communities, leading to many semi-supervised learning methods. Previous semi-supervised methods (Hinton et al., 2006; Vincent et al., 2010; Bengio et al., 2007) are often used for weight initialization, i.e. pre-training, followed by normal supervised fine-tuning phase. Unsupervised learning are applied to get better initial weight parameters by trying to extract the hidden features which are beneficial for data reconstruction. However these features may be irrele-\nvant to determine the class label in certain classification tasks. For sequence classification problem, Socher et al. (Socher et al., 2013) proposed a similar model using semi-supervised method. The model jointly optimize both reconstruct error and prediction accuracy.\nRecently, variational auto-encoder (Kingma and Welling, 2013) is proposed and it has shown impressive performance in image generation tasks. It has also been applied in semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014; Maaløe et al., 2016) and achieved the best results in several image semisupervised learning tasks . We refer to these kind of models as SemiVAEs. Different from traditional semi-supervised learning method, this method consists of two cost functions for both labeled data and unlabelled data. The cost for unlabelled data is the expectation of conditional generation likelihood on classification probability of each category. Hence minimizing this cost optimizes conditional generation model as well as classification model. Adoption of conditional generation models and independent classifier alleviates the problem with previous pre-training methods, i.e. extracting features only relevant to data reconstruct.\nSequence classification tasks take sequence as input to predict category labels, whose research hotspot including sentiment classification problem, text categorization, etc. However, SemiVAE can not be applied to sequence classification tasks directly. Sequence classification is different from common image classification problem in several aspects, a) the length of datasamples are variable b) the data distribution of same category is more diverse and c) the category information is more abstract. We combines the variational autoencoders for semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014) and its application in sequence generation (Bowman et al., 2015) for sequence classifiar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n02 51\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nM ar\n2 01\n6\ncation problem. In our implementation the generation is modelled by a long short-term memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). To model conditional generation (main component necessary in SemiVAE), one obvious option is to take the init hidden state and category feature as the first input and then predict each word sequentially using recurrent neural networks, e.g LSTM. Nonetheless we found this implementation would confuse the model to ignore the label input and hence failed to improve the classification accuracy. To force the conditional generation model to be aware of category feature, we utilize the similar structure with semantically controlled LSTM (Sc-LSTM), which is proprosed in (Wen et al., 2015). Using Sc-LSTM, the category feature is fed to generation model at each step, explicitly informing the generation model to be conditioned on given category. The resulting model is capable of apply this semi-supervised method in sequence domain successfully.\nIn the experiment we show our results on IMDB dataset, which is a common dataset for sentiment classification task. We compare our model with pure supervised learning models and illustrate the importance of several key components in our method.\nThe article is organized as follows. In the next section, we introduce several background works. And then our model is presented in details. In section 4, we obtain both quantitive results and qualitative analysis about our models. At last we conclude our paper with a detailed discussion."

      "text" : "Recently variaitonal autoencoder (VAE) have drawn a lot of attentions due to its impressive results reported in (Kingma and Welling, 2013) and (Gregor et al., 2015). It is equipped with a top-down generative network θ and a bottomup recognition network φ. Both networks are jointly trained to maximize the variational lower bound of data likelihood. Given dataset X = {x1, x2, ......, xN}, the variational auto-encoder aims to maximize the loglikelihood of all datapoints logpθ(x1, x2, ..., xN ) = ∑N i=1 logpθ(xi). Different form traditiontal auto-encoder architecture, the VAE at first samples latent representation z from a learned posterior distribution pφ(z|x), using reparameterization tricks (Kingma\nand Welling, 2013). Then x is reconstructed from the latent space of z by generative model pθ(x|z). VAEs encode each datapoint x into a small region (but not a point) in latent space. With this trait, the model has a more smooth latent space than previous autoencoders. The variational lower bound is:\nlogpθ(x) ≥ Eqφ [logpθ(x|z)] −KL[qφ(z|x)||p(z)]\n(1)\nGenerally the first term approximate the reconstruction probability. The distribution of p(x|z) takes the form of Gaussian or Bernoulli distribution, for continuous or binary valued data respectively. The second term acts as the regulariser by minimizing the difference between the prior p(z) and the learned posterior pφ(z|x), usually both distributions are diagonal Gaussian. The model is specified as follows:\nlogpθ(x) ≥ Eqφ [logpθ(x|z)] −KL[qφ(z|x)||p(z)]\n(2)\np(z) = N(Z|0, I) (3)\npθ(x|z) =N (x|µθ(z), δθ(z)) or B(x|µθ(z))\n(4)\nwhere µφ(x), δφ(x), µθ(z), δθ(z) are represented as multi-layer perceptron networks."

      "text" : "Conditional generative models can generate data according to certain attributions of given label. Kingma et al.(Kingma et al., 2014) firstly proposed a conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE) to successfully separate the image style and content information. Several other works (Maaløe et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2015) also proved CVAE to be powerful in image generation tasks. In addition, semi-supervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014; Maaløe et al., 2016) can help improving the discriminative results by employing unlabeled data. Given labeled dataset X,Y = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2)......, (xN , yN )} the lower bound of CVAE is:\nlogpθ(x, y) ≥ Eqφ(z|x,y)[logpθ(x|y, z) + logpθ(y) + logp(z)− logqφ(z|x, y)] = −L(x, y)\n(5)\nFor the unlabeled dataset, the unobserved label y is predicted form the recognition model with a learned classifier qφ(y|x). The lower bound is hence: logpθ(x) ≥ ∑ y qφ(y|x)(−L(x, y)) +H(qφ(y|x))\n= −U(x) (6)\nThis equation is the key for semi-supervised learning. Note that the first term is the expection of labeled lower bound on qφ(y|x) and intuitively we can explain the procedure as follows: 1) once we can roughly infer the log likelihood of a certain sample x with ground-true label yp, i.e. pθ(x|yp, z) and wrong label yn. pθ(x|yp, z) is likely to be greater than pθ(x|yn, z). And hence the gradient computed for qφ(yp|x) has a greater coefficient for qφ(yp|x), and such reinforce the classifier. 2) if the classifier can predict the right label for most time, the generation model will be strengthened in a similar way. This is a positive feedback in the training. We will show how this mechanism can be applied in this sequence classification tasks in our method.\nActually the classification loss term is also added to the objective function, so that the classifier qφ(y|x) can be learned from labeled dateset. Hence the overall objective for entire dataset is now:\nJ = ∑\n(x,y)∈Sl L(x, y) + ∑ x∈Su U(x)\n+ αE(x,y)∈Sl [−logqφ(y|x)] (7)"

However, one-by-one generation mechanism in RNNs can’t extract high level features like topic, style and sentiment properties. To solve the problem, variational recurrent autoencoders (VRAEs) have been employed in modeling global features for sequential data like sentences(Bowman et al., 2015) and music(Fabius and van Amersfoort, 2014). Similar with the aforementioned models, VRAEs use encoder-decoder structure. In recognitive model, sequence x is processed by encoder\nRNNs to extract the global information, while in generative model latent variables z are used to initialize the hidden state for decoder RNNs."

      "heading" : "3.1 Sc-LSTM",
      "text" : "To model the sequence generation conditioned on both hidden state z and class label y, we originally simply concatenate y and z as the initial state for LSTM. However during experiments we found this simple implementation failed to improve the classification performance since the model figures out that ignoring the class feature and minimizing the generation likelihood according to language model (i.e. predicting next word according to a small context windows) is the best strat-\negy to optimize the objective function. This is because the category information is passed to generation network only at first time-step and the conditional generation probability is maximized over all kinds of categories (each multiplied with a coefficient produced by classifier qφ(y|x)). If the conditional generation model can not distinguish between different category features, the model will be incapable to take advantage of positive feedback mechanism described in section 2.2, and hence fail to boost the performance using this semi-supervised learning method.\nConsidering this, we force the conditional generation model to generate sequence at each timestep to be aware of given labels. Simplified semantically controlled LSTM (Sc-LSTM) network proposed in (Wen et al., 2015) is adopted to achieve this goal. The Sc-LSTM is defined by the following equations:\nit = σ(Wwiwt +Whiht−1) (12)\nft = σ(Wwfwt +Whfht−1) (13)\not = σ(Wwowt +Whoht−1) (14)\nĉt = tanh(Wwcwt +Whiht−1) (15)\nht = ot ⊗ tanh(ct) (16)\nct = ft ⊗ ct−1 + it ◦ ĉt + tanh(Wycy) (17)\nwhere the first six equations are the same as in standard LSTM networks and the last equation has an extra term about y. Therefore the model is explicitly informed of the existence of category feature all the steps. By using this setting the conditional generation model has to distinguish between the different labels. The details analysis will be made in section 4."

The dataset\nconsists of 25K labelled datasamples for training, 25K labelled datasamples for testing and 50K unlabelled datasamples used for semi-supervised learning. The dataset has adequate samples to training classifier as well as generation model.\nFor device set, we randomly sample 5K samples from training set. We adopt a common implementation for classification model, i.e. using the averaged hidden state generated by standard LSTM network to predict the label. Averaging the hidden states is more easier for training reported in (Hong and Fang, ). Although there are some other more sophisticated methods for sequence classification, we use this standard model for simplicity in following experiments. Our results may not supass the state-of-art results for IMDB dataset yet due to the limitation of classifier, but still has demonstrated the sufficiency of our semi-supervised method for sequential data.\nWe compare our method (denoted as SemiSeq) with pure-supervised LSTM classifier, with different size of labelled datasamples. To split the labelled data for each experiment we sample from training set with two categories balanced and leave the others unlabelled. The results is listed in table 4. We draw the results of testset with best results on devset in each single experiment.\nIn all experiments our method is able to improve the classification accuracy for about 1∼2%. Note that the accuracy using 25K samples and carefully chosen hyper-parameters is about 89.1%, which can be regarded as the performance limit of LSTM network for IMDB sentiment classification task. With less labelled samples more improvement can be obtained.\nIn the future other datasets may be considered."

Assuming sub-sequence has enough information to infer the category, trun-\ncated sequence will suffice to differ the generation likelihood of various class feature. On the other hand, the recurrent neural network, even LSTM, is incapable of model very long sequence generation. This trick alleviate the difficulty for conditional generation model.\nIn the implementation for IMDB dataset where average sequence length is approximately 300, we randomly draw sub-sequence uniformly from each data sample to speed up training. In experiments we found that this trick works well for the purpose of fast training. The training speed is about 3 times faster comparing to using whole sequence."

Since the word-dropout make the generation probability unstable and hence influence the gradient computed for sequence classifier. Hence in our implementation, we use this mechanism only for labelled data, i.e. equation 5, but not in equation 6."

We propose a new semisupervised learning method for sequence classification tasks. Our work is based on both deep generative model for semisupervised learning (Kingma et al., 2014) and variational auto-encoder for sequence modeling (Bowman et al., 2015). We found the introduction of Sc-LSTM is critical to the success in our method. We have obtained some preliminary experimental results on IMDB sentiment classification dataset, showing that the proposed model improves the classification accuracy comparing to pure supervised classifier.",
