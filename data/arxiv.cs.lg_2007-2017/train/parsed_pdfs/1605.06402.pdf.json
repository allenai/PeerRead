Their performance in computer vision have matched and in some areas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capture complex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. State-ofart networks require billions of arithmetic operations and millions of parameters.\nTo enable embedded devices such as smart phones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing power of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease both execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast connection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important, computation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep neural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of accelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which enables energy-efficient inference.\nWe present Ristretto, a fast and automated framework for CNN approximation. Ristret-\nto simulates the hardware arithmetic of a custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network parameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area for multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the need for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The tool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy.\nSince training of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly optimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any given network.\nGiven a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully condense CaffeNet and\nSqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.\n-viii-\nAcknowledgments\nFirst and foremost, I want to thank my major advisor Professor Soheil Ghiasi for his guidance, inspiration and encouragement that he gave me during my graduate studies.

This annually held competition has seen state-of-the-art image classification accuracies by deep networks such as AlexNet by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2015), GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) and ResNet (He et al., 2015). All winners since 2012 have used deep convolutional neural networks. These networks contain millions of parameters and require billions of arithmetic operations.\nTraining of large networks like AlexNet is a very time-consuming process and can take multiple days or even weeks. The training procedure of these networks is only possible thanks to recent advancements in graphics processing units. High-end GPUs enable fast deep learning, thanks to their large throughput and memory capacity. When training AlexNet with Berkeley’s deep learning framework Caffe (Jia et al., 2014) and Nvidia’s cuDNN (Chetlur et al., 2014), a Tesla K-40 GPU can process an image in just 4ms.\nWhile GPUs are an excellent accelerator for deep learning in the cloud, mobile systems are much more sensitive to energy consumption. In order to deploy deep learning algorithm in energy-constraint mobile systems, various approaches have been offered to reduce the computational and memory requirements of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Various FPGA-based accelerators (Suda et al., 2016; Qiu et al., 2016) have proven that it is possible to use reconfigurable hardware for end-to-end inference of large CNNs like AlexNet and VGG. Moreover, we see an increasing amount of ASIC designs for deep\n1\nCNNs (Chen et al., 2016; Sim et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016a).\nBefore implementing hardware accelerators, a first crucial step consists of condensing the neural network in question. Various work has been conducted recently to reduce the computational and memory requirements of neural networks. However, no opensource project exists which would help a hardware developer to quickly and automatically determine the best way to reduce the complexity of a trained neural network. Moreover, too aggressive compression of neural networks leads to reduction in classification accuracy.\nIn this thesis we present Ristretto, a framework for automated neural network approximation. The framework is open source and we hope it will speed up the development process of energy efficient hardware accelerators. Our framework focuses on condensing neural networks without adding any computational complexity such as decompression or sparse matrix multiplication. Ristretto is a Caffe-based approximation framework and was developed for fast, automated, efficient and flexible CNN compression for later deployment in hardware accelerators. Ristretto aims at lowering the area requirements for processing elements, and lowering the memory footprint which in turn reduces or eliminates off-chip memory communication.\nThis thesis analyses the resource-requirements of convolutional neural networks. Based on these findings, different approximation strategies are proposed to reduce the resourceintense parts of CNNs. For all different approximation strategies, we present an in-depth analysis of the compression vs accuracy trade-off.\nParts of this thesis are based on previous publications with two other authors: Mohammad Motamedi from the University of California, Davis and Professor S. Ghiasi from the same university.\n• Hardware-oriented Approximation of Convolutional Neural Networks,\nPhilipp Gysel, Mohammad Motamedi, and Soheil Ghiasi, arXiv preprint arXiv: 1604.03168 (2016).

SIFT (Lowe, 2004) and HOG (histogram of oriented gradients by Dalal and Triggs (2005)) were state-of-art for feature extraction, but they relied on handcrafted features. Neural networks in contrast can automatically create both high-level and low-level features. For a long time, deep neural networks were hindered by their computational complexity. However, advances in both personal computers and general purpose computing have enable the training of larger networks with more parameters. In 2012, the first deep convolutional neural network with 8 parameter layers was proposed by Krizhevsky et al. (2012). State-of-the art deep CNNs use a series of convolutional layers which enables them to extract very high-level features from images. Convolutional neural networks have proven to overshadow conventional neural networks in complex vision tasks."

      "text" : "Input to the forward propagation is the image to classify. The forward path consists of different layers which process the input data in a chained manner. Deep CNNs use many such layers, the last of which is used to predict the image class.\nA typical CNN architecture termed AlexNet is shown in Figure 2.1. As input to the network, we use an RGB image with dimensions 224×224. The first five layers in AlexNet are convolutional layers, and the last three are fully connected layers. Convolutional layers use 2d filters to extract features from the input. The first convolutional layer generates 2×48 feature maps, each of which represents the presence or absence of a lowlevel feature in the input image. To reduce the spatial dimension of feature maps and to add translation-invariance, pooling layers are used which do sub-sampling. Moreover, a non-linear layer is added which enables the network to learn non-linear features.\nThe last convolutional layer creates 2×128 feature maps with spatial dimension 13×13. This layer is followed by three dense layers, which produce the weighted sum of inputs. The last layer has 1000 output nodes, which are the predictions for the 1000 image classes.\nForward propagation depends on network parameters in two ways. First, the convolutional layers rely on feature filters. Second, the fully connected layers contain many parameters, each of which serves as weighted connection between a specific input and output node. These parameters are learned during the training procedure.\n4"

      "heading" : "2.1.2 Backward Propagation",
      "text" : "Training of a deep CNN requires thousands or even millions of labeled images. The network is exposed to these images, and the network parameters are gradually updated to make up for prediction errors. The purpose of backward propagation is to find the error gradient with respect to each network parameter. In a later step this error gradient is used for a parameter update.\nTraining is done in batches of images. Several images are run through the network in forward path. Denoting x as the network input, w as the network parameters and f as the overall CNN function, the network output is given by z′ = f(x,w). Since all images are labeled, the desired network output z is known. Given many pairs of images and ground-truth (x1, z1), ..., (xn, zn), we define a loss function l(z, z ′) which denotes the penalty for predicting z′ instead of z.\nWe average the loss for a batch of images, and update the parameters according to\nthe formula below:\nwt+1 = wt − α · δl δw (wt) (2.1)\nThis formula requires us to calculate the network output error w.r.t. each parameter. The above parameter update is called stochastic gradient descent, which relies on a learning rate α. There actually exist many optimizations for this parameter update such as Nesterov momentum as explained by Bengio et al. (2013) or Adam rule (Kingma and Ba, 2015). All these learning rules require the error gradient w.r.t each network parameter. Moreover these optimization procedures all work in batch mode, i.e., a batch of images (e.g. 256 images) is run through the network and the parameter update is based on the average error gradient. The error surface of neural networks is non-convex. Nevertheless, batch-based learning rules can avoid local minima by using many different training examples.\nFor computation of the error gradient w.r.t the network parameters, we first compute the error gradient with respect to each layer output, starting with the second last layer and back propagation to the second layer. In a second step, the gradients w.r.t. the layer\n5\noutputs can be used to compute the gradients w.r.t. the network parameters, using the chain rule for derivatives."

      "heading" : "2.2 Layer Types",
      "text" : "Deep convolutional neural networks process the input data layer by layer. Each layer has a specific purpose as explained in the following paragraphs.\nConvolutional layer: This layer type is used for feature extraction. Deep CNNs have many convolutional layers; AlexNet for example has five layers of this type. The feature extraction is done by a series of L convolutional layers. Each layer uses 2d kernel filters which extract features from input feature maps (IFM). The result of multiple feature extractions is summed up to form one output feature map (OFM). This process is shown in Figure 2.2, where two filter banks, each with three kernels, are used to generate 2 output feature maps. The number of input and output feature maps is denoted by N and M , and the size of one output feature map is R×C. One kernel has dimension K×K, and a layer has N×M of these kernels. The feature extraction consists of a series of multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations, as shown in Figure 2.3. Each output pixel is the sum of the 2d convolutions between the input feature maps and the respective kernels. To generate the neighboring output pixels, the kernel stack is slided across the spacial dimension by stride S.\nThe time and space complexity of convolutional layers is given in Equations 2.2 and 2.3. Assuming a stride S of 1, the computational complexity is R · C times larger than the number of parameters. It is for this reason that the computational bottleneck of deep CNNs comes from convolutional layers.\n6\nruntime = O(RCMNK2) (2.2)\nparameter size = O(MNK2) (2.3)\nFully connected layer: Fully connected layers serve the same purpose as convolutional layers, namely feature extraction. Fully connected layers, alternatively termed dense layers, build the weighted sums of their input. Thus all input nodes are connected to all output nodes, which requires a relatively large amount of network parameters. Fully connected layers are the basic building block of classic neural networks, which are normally a concatenation of dense layers. In convolutional neural networks, the first layers are normally convolutional layers, and only one or two layer at the very end are dense.\nThe mathematical function of a fully connected layer is a simple matrix-vector product. The layer output nodes z depend on the input vector x, the parameter-matrix W and the bias b (Equation 2.4). Denoting N = |x| as the number of input nodes and M = |z| as the number of outputs, the time and space complexity is given in Equations 2.5 and 2.6. For layers with many input nodes, the parameter size usually makes up for a large part of the overall network size.\nMost fully connected layers are followed by a non-linear activation function f . Figure\n2.4 depicts a fully connected layer followed by an activation layer.\nz = W · x + b (2.4)\n7\nruntime = O(NM) (2.5)\nparameter size = O(NM) (2.6)\nRectified Linear Unit (ReLU): To enable neural networks to capture non-linear relations, several non-linear layers are inserted into the network architecture. Traditionally we used the Sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent function for this purpose. However, those classic non-linear functions have several disadvantages. First, their gradient becomes very small for large values, which means the error gradient during training vanishes. Moreover these two non-linear functions are relatively costly in terms of computing power.\nAs alternative, nearly all state-of-art CNNs use Rectified Linear Units (ReLU). This activation function was first proposed by Nair and Hinton (2010) for Restricted Boltzmann Machines. The work by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) was the first to apply this simplified activation to a deep neural networks. Deep networks trained with this activation function converge much faster.\nThe function of a ReLU layer maps negative values to zero: f(x) = max(0, x).\nNormalization layers: Local Response Normalization (LRN) layers serve the purpose of normalization across feature maps or across the spatial dimension. There are generally two type of LRN layers: LRN across feature maps and LRN within feature maps. The\n8\nfirst type of normalization serves the purpose of normalizing neurons in the same spatial position, but different feature maps. This creates competition between neurons generated by different kernels and improves the top-1 accuracy of AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) by 1.4%. The exact mathematical formulation of LRN across channels can be found in the same paper.\nMany state-of-art CNNs use LRN layers to increase accuracy (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015). One notable exception is the network by Simonyan and Zisserman (2015) which performs very well without any kind of normalization.\nMost recently, a new normalization strategy termed Batch Normalization (BN) was proposed (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015). This strategy was adopted by the most recent winner of the ILSVRC competition (Russakovsky et al., 2015).\nWhile both normalization strategies help for faster convergence and better prediction accuracy, they also add computational overhead, especially batch normalization. Unfortunately these normalization layers require a very large dynamic range for intermediate values. In AlexNet for example, the intermediate values of LRN layers are 214 times larger than any intermediate value from another layer. For this reason this thesis assumes LRN and BN layers are to be implemented in floating point, and we concentrate on the approximation of other layer types. Notice that previous work by Suda et al. (2016) chose 32-bit floating point for FPGA-based LRN layers.\nPooling: Pooling layers are normally used between successive convolutional layers in CNNs. They can be considered as sub-sampling functions. The purpose of pooling layers\n9\nis to reduce the spatial dimension of feature maps and encode translation invariance. By reducing the feature map dimensions, we also reduce the parameter size and computational complexity, and thus lower chances for over-fitting.\nThe most commonly used pooling type in CNNs is MAX pooling, although other types such as average pooling and L2-norm pooling exist. MAX pooling does not required any arithmetic operation except comparisons. Since this layer type is cheap in terms of computation and parameter size, this thesis leaves this layer type as is and we perform no approximation.\nAn example of a MAX pooling operation is shown in Figure 2.5, where 2x2 kernels are used to extract the maximum value. The result is stored as output on the right side of the Figure. Pooling layers are associated with a kernel size and a stride. The stride indicates how many pixels are skipped between pooling operations. Notice that in the above example, the data size is reduced by 75%."

The second resource-intense layer type are fully connected layers, which contain over 90% of the network parameters. An energy-efficient accelerator for CNNs needs to 1) offer a large enough computational throughput and 2) offer a memory-bandwidth that can keep the processing elements busy.\nCaffeNet is the Caffe-version of AlexNet by Krizhevsky et al. (2012). CaffeNet was developed for the ImageNet data set, which has 1000 image classes. Figure 2.6 shows the required arithmetic operations and parameters size of AlexNet by layer type. The major part of arithmetic operations comes from convolutional layers: this layer type requires a total of 2.15 G operations. The arithmetic operations in all other layers sum up to 117 M operations. The parameter size of CaffeNet is 250 MB, of which 235 MB comes from fully connected layers.\nThe same trend can be observed for the 16-layer version of VGG by Simonyan and Zisserman (2015): Extracting features in convolutional layers is computation-intense, while fully connected layers are memory-intense.

In its first year the competition consisted of an image classification challenge only. In the meantime, different new challenges were introduced such as object detection and localization in images, object detection from video as well as scene classification.\nFor training of the classifier, ILSVRC provides the ImageNet data set, which consisted originally of 1000 image categories and a total of 1.2 million images. In the meantime, this data base has been significantly expanded, and currently holds over 14 million labeled images.\nA common performance measure for deep CNNs is their classification accuracy on the ILSVRC 2012 data set. For this challenge, the classifier is trained on a training data set, and tested by the researcher on a validation data set. For the official score in the ILSVRC competition, a private test data set is used which is not available to the public. Most researchers give their performance numbers in top-1 and top-5 measure. The top-1 measure gives the percentage of images that were classified correctly on either the validation or test set. Since the ImageNet data set has very fine-grained image classes which are sometimes even hard for humans to distinguish, most researchers prefer to use the top-5 measure. Here, an image is considered as classified correctly if one of the top5 predictions is correct. In the remainder of this thesis, we will concentrate on top-1 accuracy, since this captures better how CNN approximation affects network accuracy."

GoogLeNet finds a good balance for reducing both classification error and network size. This network by Google outperforms AlexNet and VGG in both aspects. SqueezeNet is the smallest architecture, but its accuracy is not outstanding.

In this thesis we simulate the arithmetic of a hardware accelerator. The simulated data path is shown in Figure 2.9.\nThe difference between this simulated data path and the original full precision data path is the quantization step of weights, layer inputs, and layer outputs. Therefore the condensed networks will suffer from quantization errors, which can affect the network accuracy.\nIn this thesis we propose a framework which can approximate 32-bit floating point networks by condensed ones which use quantized values. In order to simulate a condensed\n15\nlayer, given a full precision reference network, the following three steps are required:\n• Quantization of the layer input and weights to reduced precision format (using m and n bits for number representation, respectively)\n• Perform the MAC operations using the quantized values\n• The final result is again quantized\nThese steps are summarized in Figure 2.10."

Notice that some of the layer input and weight values are actually reused for different multipliers, depending on the exact characteristics of the layer in question.\nTo reduce the number of bits required for number representation, our approximation framework quantizes both the layer inputs and weights. The resulting values can be represented using significantly fewer bits. As a result, the multiplication units require less area. In order to simplify simulation of hardware, our framework uses 32-bit floating point for accumulation. To achieve the same result in a hardware accelerator, the adder\n16\ntree should use 32-bit. Adders are much cheaper in terms of area and power, compared to multipliers.

A practical solution to this problem is to use stochastic gradient descent, as explained in subsection 2.1.1. In the traditional setting of 64-bit floating point training, this optimization is a continuous problem with a smooth error surface. The error surface of neural networks depends on its input and its current parameters. For quantized networks, this error surface becomes discrete. This new optimization problem – where the goal is to find an optimal set of discrete valued parameters – is an NP-hard problem. One approach to find a good set of discrete parameters is to train in limited precision ‘from scratch’. In this approach, we would train the network with quantized parameters right from the start. All the weight updates would be discrete. We chose to use another approach: Our framework first trains a network in the continuous domain, then quantizes the parameters, and finally fine-tunes in discrete parameter space. This way we can fully leverage pre-trained networks which saves considerable amount of time.\nDuring this retraining procedure, the network learns how to classify images with limited precision parameters. Since the network weights can only have discrete values, the main challenge consists in the weight update. We adopt the idea of previous work by Courbariaux et al. (2015) which uses full precision shadow weights. Small weight updates ∆w are applied to the full precision weights w, whereas the discrete weights w′ are sampled from the full precision weights.

These numbers are constraint to +1 and -1 for both forward and backward propagation. Convolutional neural networks mainly consist of multiply-accumulate operations. For a binarized network, these operations are replaced by binary XNOR and binary count.

When the network is quantized to 8-bit, the network output is random and the accuracy drops to 10%. Since our quantization framework is unable to achieve good results at 8-bit, we double the bit-width. The network works fine in 16-bit, with a relative accuracy loss below 1%. The best results were achieved using 8 integer bits, whereas LeNet only required 4 integer bits (see Table 4.1).\nFinally we quantize CaffeNet, a network for ImageNet classification. As before, 8-bit quantization yields poor results, which is the reason we choose 16-bit fixed point. The\n30\nrelative accuracy loss after quantization is 8.4% and the fine-tuned network achieves an accuracy within 4.5% of the baseline (compared in absolute values).\nIn order to increase the accuracy of the quantized networks, we introduce dynamic\nfixed point in the next section.\n31\nChapter 5\nDynamic Fixed Point Approximation\nIn this chapter we discuss quantization of a floating point CNN to a dynamic fixed point version. We extend the fixed point format to dynamic fixed point, and show how it can be used to further decrease parameter size while maintaining a high prediction accuracy."

In dynamic fixed point, each number is represented as follows:\n(−1)s · 2−FL B−2∑ i=0 2i · xi (5.1)\nHere B denotes the bit-width, s the sign bit, FL is the fractional length, and x the mantissa bits. Since the intermediate values in a network have different ranges, it is desirable to group fixed point numbers into groups with constant FL. So the number of bits allocated to the fractional part is constant within that group, but different compared to other groups. Each network layer is split into two groups: one for the layer outputs, one for the layer weights. This allows to better cover the dynamic range of both layer outputs and weights, as weights are normally significantly smaller. On the hardware side, it is possible to realize dynamic fixed point arithmetic using bit shifters.\n33\nThe concept of dynamic fixed point is depicted in Figure 5.2, where two numbers are both represented in 8 bits, but belong to a different group (i.e., they have different fractional length)."

These weights can be considered as minifloat numbers with zero mantissa bits. By using such weights, all multiplications turn into bit shifts, which can save a significant amount of energy on a hardware accelerator.\nWe now detail the approximation of convolutional and fully connected layers with multiplier-free arithmetic. Although we assume strictly positive weights in this discussion, it is straight forward the expand the approximation procedure to both positive and negative weights. The computation of convolutional and fully connected layers consists of multiplication-and-accumulation operations. Equation 7.1 shows the necessary operations in a full precision network. The layer inputs xj are multiplied with layer parameters wj and the accumulation yields the result zi. To simplify this discussion, we assume the input data has been rearranged such that output zi = w T · x. In order to switch to multiplier-free arithmetic, we first approximate parameters by the closest integer-power-\n43\nof-two number (Equation 7.2). Now output zi can be approximated by equation 7.3 which is multiplier-free.

      "text" : "The first published work to represent ImageNet networks with binary weights was by Rastegari et al. (2016). Their results show that very deep networks can be approximated with binary weights, although at an accuracy drop of around 3% for CaffeNet and 6% for GoogLeNet. Substituting 32-bit floating point parameters with just one bit of information necessarily reduces the network’s accuracy to extract features from images. The challenge with binary parameters is to achieve high prediction accuracy without increasing the parameter size or adding additional computational overhead."

      "text" : "Many academic projects use high-level synthesis tools for FPGA and ASIC based accelerators. The standard development tool-chain starts with a C-implementation of the\n1http://ristretto.lepsucd.com/ 2https://github.com/pmgysel/caffe\n56\nalgorithm, which then undergoes many unit tests to verify correct functionality. In a next step the C-code is manually converted to System-C which serves as input to high level synthesis (HLS). Highly optimized HLS tools can produce very efficient Verilog code within a fraction of the time which would be needed for manual Verilog coding. We plan to add a feature to Ristretto which allows for automatic generation of the C-code of a condensed network. This feature will produce the necessary code files as well as a dump of the extracted low-precision parameters.\nWe hope that Ristretto will enable researchers to speed up their development time for CNN accelerators. Hopefully Ristretto will gain traction in the community. As it is an open-source project, the community can help adding new features to the framework, which will make the tool even more powerful.\n57\nReferences\nAbadi, M., Agarwal, A., Barham, P., Brevdo, E., Chen, Z., Citro, C., Corrado, G.

While both normalization strategies help for faster convergence and better prediction accuracy, they also add computational overhead, especially batch normalization. Unfortunately these normalization layers require a very large dynamic range for intermediate values. In AlexNet for example, the intermediate values of LRN layers are 2 times larger than any intermediate value from another layer. For this reason this thesis assumes LRN and BN layers are to be implemented in floating point, and we concentrate on the approximation of other layer types. Notice that previous work by Suda et al.

Their performance in computer vision have matched and in some areas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capture complex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. State-ofart networks require billions of arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devices such as smart phones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing power of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease both execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast connection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important, computation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep neural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of accelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which enables energy-efficient inference. We present Ristretto, a fast and automated framework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic of a custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network parameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area for multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the need for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The tool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Since training of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly optimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any given network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.",
