      "text" : "Recent work on generative adversarial networks (GANs) [9] and other deep latent variable models has shown significant progress in learning smooth latent variable representations of complex, highdimensional continuous data such as images [1, 2, 25, 37]. These latent representations facilitate the ability to apply smooth transformations and interpolations in latent space in order to produce complex modifications of generated outputs, while still remaining on the data manifold.\nUnfortunately, learning similar latent representations of discrete structures, such as text sequences or discretized images, remains a challenging problem. Applying GANs directly to this task produces discrete output from the generator, which then requires clever approaches for backpropagation. Furthermore this issue is compounded in cases where the generative model is recurrent, e.g. in sequence modeling. Researchers have circumvented some of these issues by using policy gradient\nSubmitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n04 22\n3v 1\n[ cs\nmethods [5, 12, 36] or with the Gumbel-Softmax distribution [17]. However, neither approach can yet produce robust latent representations directly from samples, particularly for discrete structures.\nAn alternative approach is to instead encode discrete structures in a continuous code space to circumvent this problem altogether. As this space is continuous, traditional GAN training can be directly applied to learn a latent representation of the code space itself. Samples from the GAN can then be decoded to generate discrete outputs. While in theory this technique can be applied directly, in practice, learning general-purpose autoencoders is in itself a difficult problem.\nIn this work, we propose a simple extension of this technique by jointly training a code-space GAN and a discrete structure autoencoder, which we call an adversarially regularized autoencoder (ARAE). The approach allows us to use a general-purpose GAN architecture that generates continuous code representations, while at the same time deploying task-specific autoencoder architectures, like a recurrent neural network for text, to produce and decode from these latent representations.\nThe ARAE approach can be used both as a generative model and as a way to obtain an encoding of the input. First, it learns a GAN with a Gaussian latent space that can be sampled to produce discrete structures. This model can be compared directly with existing generative models. Second, it learns an adversarially regularized encoder that can produce useful code space representations from discrete structures, without requiring an explicit code-space prior. We can compare this method to other specialized autoencoders such as denoising and variational autoencoders.\nOur experiments test ARAE on two different discrete domains: discretized images and text sequences. We show that this approach successfully learns latent representations for both tasks, as the model is able to generate coherent samples, ignore or fix corrupted inputs, and produce predictable changes in the outputs when performing manipulations in the latent space. We find that we are able perform consistent sentence manipulations by moving around in the latent space via offset vectors. A similar property was observed in image GANs [25] and word representations [23]. Finally, experiments on a semi-supervised learning task for natural language inference provide quantitative evidence that this approach improves upon continuous representations learned by autoencoders.

      "text" : "GANs for Discrete Structures The success of GANs on images have led many researchers to consider applying GANs to discrete data such as text. Policy gradient methods are a natural way to deal with the resulting non-differentiable generator objective when training directly in discrete space [8, 34]. When trained on text data however, such methods often require pre-training/co-training with a maximum likelihood (i.e. language modeling) objective [5, 36, 18]. This precludes there being a latent encoding of the sentence, and is also a potential disadvantage of existing language models (which can otherwise generate locally-coherent samples).\nAnother direction of work has been through reparameterizing the categorical distribution with the Gumbel-Softmax trick [14, 19]—while initial experiments were encouraging on a synthetic task [17], scaling them to work on natural language is a challenging open problem. There has also been a flurry of recent, related approaches that work directly with the soft outputs from a generator [10, 28, 30, 24]. For example, Shen et al. [30] train with adversarial loss for unaligned style transfer between text by having the discriminator act on the RNN hidden states and using the soft outputs at each step as input to an RNN generator.\nVariational Autoencoders Ideally, autoencoders would learn useful coded feature representations of their inputs. However in practice simple autoencoders often learn a degenerate identity mapping where the latent code space is free of any structure. One way—among others—to regularize the code space is through having an explicit prior on the code space and using a variational approximation to the posterior, leading to a family of models called variational autoencoders (VAE) [16, 27]. Unfortunately VAEs for text can be challenging to train—for example, if the training procedure is not carefully tuned with techniques like word dropout and KL annealing [4], the decoder simply becomes a language model and ignores the latent code (although there has been some recent successes with convolutional models [29, 35]).\nA possible reason for the difficulty in training VAEs is due to the strictness of the prior (usually a spherical Gaussian) and/or the parameterization of the posterior. There has been some work on making\nthe prior/posterior more flexible through explicit parameterization [26, 15, 6]. One notable technique is adversarial autoencoders (AAE) [21] which attempt to imbue the model with a more flexible prior implicitly through adversarial training. In AAEs, the discriminator is trained to distinguish between samples from a fixed prior distribution and the input encoding, thereby pushing the code distribution to match the prior. Our approach has similar motivation, but notably we do not sample from a fixed prior distribution—our ‘prior’ is instead parameterized through a generator. Nonetheless, this view (which has been observed by various researchers [32, 22, 20]) provides an interesting connection between VAEs and GANs."

      "text" : "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of parameterized implicit generative models [9]. The method approximates drawing samples from a true distribution c ∼ Pr by instead employing a latent variable z and a parameterized deterministic generator function c̃ = gθ(z) to produce generated samples c̃ ∼ Pg . The aim is to characterize the complex data manifold described by the unknown Pr within the latent space z.\nGAN training utilizes two separate models: a generator g(z) maps a latent vector from some easy-tosample source distribution to a value and a critic/discriminator f(c) aims to distinguish real data and fake samples, generated by g. The generator is trained to fool the critic, and the critic to separate out real from generated.\nIn this work, we utilize the recently-proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) [1]. WGAN replaces the Jensen-Shannon divergence in standard GANs with Earth-Mover (Wasserstein-1) distance. WGAN training uses the following min-max optimization over generator parameters θ and critic parameters w,\nmin θ max w∈W\nEc∼Pr [fw(c)]− Ec̃∼Pg [fw(c̃)], (1)\nwhere fw : C 7→ R denotes the critic function, c̃ is obtained from the generator, c̃ = gθ(z), and Pr and Pg are real (true samples) and fake (generated samples) distribution respectively. Notably the critic parameters w are restricted to an 1-Lipschitz function setW , which can be shown to make this term correspond to Wasserstein-1 Distance. We follow [1] and use a naive implementation to approximately enforce this property by weight-clipping, i.e. w = [− , ]d. Throughout this work we only use gθ and fw as fully-connected networks, namely MLPs."

Ideally the code represents important abstracted features of the original input (although this is difficult to formalize) instead of learning to simply copy any given input.\nWe are interested in probabilistic autoencoders for discrete structures. Define X = Vn to be a discrete set of structures where V is a vocabulary of symbols. For instance, for binarized images V = {0, 1} and n is the number of pixels , or for sentences V = {1, . . . , #words} and n is the sentence length. A discrete structure autoencoder consists of two parameterized functions: a deterministic encoder function encφ : X 7→ C with parameters φ and a decoder distribution pψ(x | c) with parameters ψ that gives a distribution over structures X . The model is trained on cross-entropy reconstruction loss where we learn parameters to minimize the negative log-likelihood of reconstruction:\nLAE(φ, ψ) = − log pψ(x | encφ(x)) (2)\nComputing this for arbitrary sets is intractable, so the choice of pψ is important and problem specific. Finally it is often useful to use the decoder to produce a point estimate from X . We call this x̃ = argmaxx pψ(x | encφ(x)) When x = x̃ the autoencoder is said to copy the input, or perfectly reconstruct x."

Our model employs a discrete autoencoder to learn continuous codes based on discrete inputs\nand a WGAN to learn an implicit probabilistic model over these codes. The aim is to exploit the GAN’s ability to learn the latent structure of code data, while using an autoencoder to abstract away the encoding and generation of discrete structure to support GAN training.\nThe main difference with WGANs as described above, is that we no longer have access to observed data samples for the GAN. Instead we have access to discrete structure x ∼ Px where Px is the distribution of interest. (Working with this space directly would require backpropagating through non-differentiable operations and is the basis for policy gradient methods for GAN training.) We handle this issue by integrating an encoder into the procedure which first maps x to a continuous code c = encφ(x), i.e. using the code vector for each observed structure defined by encφ .\nThe full model has a three part objective.

Theoretically, the effect of such term should decrease (and eventually diminish) as the GAN converges to a Nash-Equalibrium."

For both models we use the same WGAN architecture but substitute in different autoencoder architectures. The generator architecture uses a low dimensional z with a Gaussian prior p(z) = N (0, I), and maps it to c. Both the critic fw and the generator gθ are parameterized as feed-forward MLPs. The structure of the deterministic encoder encφ and probabilistic decoder pψ is specialized for the domain.\nImage Model Our first model uses a fully-connected neural network to encode binarized images. Here X = {0, 1}n where n is the image size. The encoder used is a feed-forward MLP network mapping from {0, 1}n 7→ Rm, encφ(x) = MLP(x;φ) = c.

Here X = Vn where n is the sentence length and V is the vocabulary of the underlying language (typically |V| ∈ [10k, 100k]). Following usual practice we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as both the text encoder and decoder. Define an RNN as a parameterized recurrent function hj = RNN(xj ,hj−1;φ) for j = 1 . . . n (with h0 = 0) that maps a discrete input structure x to hidden vectors h1 . . .hn. For the encoder, we define encφ(x) = hn = c, the last hidden state in this recurrence. The decoder is defined in a similar way, with parameters ψ. For prediction we combine c with hj to produce a distribution over V at each time step, pψ(x | c) = ∏n j=1 softmax(W[hj ; c] + b)xj where W and b are parameters (part of ψ). Finding the most likely sequence x̃ under this distribution is intractable, but we can approximate it using greedy search or beam search. In our experiments we use an LSTM architecture [13] for both the encoder/decoder, and train with teacher-forcing.\nSemi-Supervised Model Our model is trained in an unsupervised manner as a combination of an autoencoder and a GAN. As an extension we also consider the use case where the code vector is additionally used as input to a supervised classification task. As in the standard semi-supervised setup, we assume that our data consist of a small set of labeled data {xi, yi}i and large set of unlabeled data {xj}j . We can set up a standard supervised classification loss function using the code vectors from the encoder and a new set of parameters γ:\nLNLL(γ, φ) = ∑ i log pγ(yi|encφ(xi)) (6)\nWe then extend our multi-task loss function to include this objective."

This corpus provides a useful testbed as it comprises of sentences with relatively simple structure. The corpus is additionally annotated for pairwise sentence classification, which allows us to experiment with semi-supervised learning in a controlled setting. For this task the model is presented with two sentences—premise and hypothesis—and has to predict their relationship: entailment, contradiction, or neutral. For training, we used a subset of the corpus consisting of sentences of less than 15 words, although preliminary results suggest this approach works up to 30 words.\nWe consider several different empirical tasks to test the performance of the model as both an autoencoder (ARAE), by use the encoder aspect, and as latent-variable model (ARAE-GAN), by sampling z’s (the two are trained identically). Experiments include: (1) code space structure; does the model preserve natural inputs x ∼ Px while not preserving noised inputs x′; (2) semi-supervised learning; does the performance of a supervised model improve when it is additionally trained as an autoencoder; (3) sample generation; how well does a simple model do when trained on generated samples; (4) interpolation and arithmetic; how easily can we manipulate vectors in Z to smoothly control the generated text samples x̃.\nFor these experiments we compare to a standard AE, trained without the code-space GAN component, as well as a standard language model.

      "text" : "As the code space we use by definition does not have the capacity to represent the entire discrete input space, ideally the autoencoder would learn to maintain valid representations for only real inputs which roughly exist along a low-dimensional manifold determined by the space of natural images or natural language sentences. This property is difficult to maintain in standard autoencoders, which often learn a partial identity mapping, but ideally should be improved by code space regularization. We test this property by passing two sets of samples through ARAE, one of true held-out samples and the other of explicitly-noised examples existing off this manifold.\nFigure 2 (left) shows these examples and their reconstruction from the discretized MNIST where the noised examples come from adding noise to the original image. For images we observe that a regular AE simply copies inputs, regardless of whether the input is on the data manifold. ARAE, on the other hand, will learn not reproduce the noised samples. Table 1 (right) shows similar experiments for text where we add noise by permuting k words in each sentence. Again we observe that the ARAE is able to map a noised sample back onto coherent sentences. Table 1 (left) shows empirical results for these experiments. We obtain the reconstruction error (i.e. negative log likelihood) of the original\n(non-noised) sentence under the decoder, utilizing the noised code. We find that when k = 0 (i.e. no swaps), the regular AE better reconstructs the input (as expected). However, as we increase the number of swaps and push the input further away from the data manifold, the ARAE is more likely to produce the original sentence.\nWe note that unlike denoising autoencoders which require a domain-specific noising function [11, 33], the ARAE is not explicitly trained to denoise an input, but learns to do so as a byproduct of adversarial regularization."

Acknowledging the pitfalls of such quantitative evaluations [31], for text GANs we can do this by producing a large set of sampled sentences, and training a simple language model over the generations. For these experiments we generate 100k samples from (i) ARAE-GAN, (ii) an AE, (iii) a RNN LM trained on the same data, and (iv) the real training set. To “sample” from an AE we fit a multivariate Gaussian to the code space (of the training data) after training the AE and generate code vectors from this Gaussian and decode back into sentence space. All models are of the same size to allow for fair comparison. Samples from the models are shown in Figure 3.\nWe subsequently train a standard RNN language model on the generated data and evaluate perplexity on held-out real data. The language model is of the same size as the decoder of the ARAE. As can be seen from Table 2 training on real data (understandably) outperforms training on generated data by a large margin. Surprisingly however, we find that a language model trained on ARAE-GAN data performs slightly better than one trained on LM-generated/AE-generated data."

      "text" : "A widely observed property of GANs (and VAEs) is that the Gaussian prior p(z) induces the ability to smoothly interpolate between outputs by exploiting the structure of the latent space. While language models may provide a better estimate of the underlying probability space, constructing this style of interpolation would require combinatorial search, which makes this a useful feature of text GANs. We experiment with this property by sampling two points z0 and z1 from p(z) and constructing intermediary points zλ = λz1+(1−λ)z0. For each we generate the argmax output x̃λ. The samples are shown in Figure 4 for text and in Figure 2 (right-bottom) for MNIST. While it is difficult to assess the “accuracy” of these interpolations, we generally qualitatively observe smooth changes in the output sentences/images as we move from one latent space to another.\nAnother intriguing property of image GANs is the ability to move in the latent space via offset vectors (similar to the case with word vectors [23]). For example, Radford et al. [25] observe that when the mean latent vector for “men with glasses” is subtracted from the mean latent vector for “men without glasses” and applied to an image of a “woman without glasses”, the resulting image is that of a “woman with glasses”. We experiment to see if a similar property holds for sentences.\nWe generate 1 million sentences from the ARAE-GAN and parse the sentences to obtain the main verb, subject, and modifier. Then for a given sentence, to change the main verb we subtract the mean latent vector (t) for all other sentences with the same main verb (in the first example in Figure 5 this would correspond to all sentences that had “sleeping” as the main verb) and add the mean latent vector for all sentences that have the desired transformation (with the running example this would be all sentences whose main verb was “walking”). We do the same to transform the subject and the modifier. We decode back into sentence space with the transformed latent vector via sampling from pψ(g(z+ t)). Some examples of successful transformations are shown in Figure 5 (right).\nQuantitative evaluation of the success of the vector transformations is given in Figure 5 (left). For each original vector z we sample 100 sentences from pψ(g(z+ t)) over the transformed new latent vector and consider it a match if any of the sentences demonstrate the desired transformation. Match % is proportion of original vectors that yield a match post transformation. As we ideally want the generated samples to only differ in the specified transformation, we also calculate the average word precision against the original sentence (Prec) for any match."

We however note that (as has been frequently observed when training GANs) our model seemed to be quite sensitive to hyperparameters. Finally, while many useful models for text generation already exist, text GANs provide a qualitatively different approach influenced by the underlying latent variable structure. We envision that such a framework could be extended to a conditional setting, combined with other existing decoding schemes, or used to provide a more interpretable model of language."

The output of the encoder is normalized onto a unit ball (having l2 norm 1), denoted as c ∈ R300, before being forwarded further. • The decoder is a one-layer LSTM, with the hidden state size being 300. • The decoding process at each time step takes the top layer LSTM hidden state and concate-\nnates it with the hidden codes c, before forward them to a word transition matrix. • The initial decoder hidden state is initialized with c, with a linear transformation. • The word embedding is of size 300. • We adopt a grad clipping on both LSTMs, with a maximum allowed gradient norm being 1. • The encoder/decoder is optimized by vanilla SGD, learning rate 1. • The GAN employs a MLP generator, with structure 100-150-300-500, batch normaliza-\ntion, and ReLU nonlinearity. The noise vector z ∈ R100. • The GAN employs a MLP critic, with structure 500-500-150-80-20-1, batch normaliza-\ntion, and LeakyReLU (scale = 0.2) nonlinearity. The clipping factor = 0.02. The critic is trained with 10 iterations in each GAN loop. • The GAN is optimized by Adam, with learning rate 5e-05 on the generator, and 1e-05 on the critic. • When we update the encoder, we normalize both sources of gradients, i.e. from the critic and decoder, based on their norms. After that, we multiply the critic gradients by 0.01 before backpropping to the encoder..\nNote we use the same architecture for all three experiment settings (i.e. label set portion: Medium (22.2%), Small (10.8%), Tiny (5.5%)). The baseline models under comparison (Supervised Encoder, Semi-Supervised AE) use the same setting as described above."

    "abstractText" : "Generative adversarial networks are an effective approach for learning rich latent representations of continuous data, but have proven difficult to apply directly to discrete structured data, such as text sequences or discretized images. Ideally we could encode discrete structures in a continuous code space to avoid this problem, but it is difficult to learn an appropriate general-purpose encoder. In this work, we consider a simple approach for handling these two challenges jointly, employing a discrete structure autoencoder with a code space regularized by generative adversarial training. The model learns a smooth regularized code space while still being able to model the underlying data, and can be used as a discrete GAN with the ability to generate coherent discrete outputs from continuous samples. We demonstrate empirically how key properties of the data are captured in the model’s latent space, and evaluate the model itself on the tasks of discrete image generation, text generation, and semi-supervised learning.",
