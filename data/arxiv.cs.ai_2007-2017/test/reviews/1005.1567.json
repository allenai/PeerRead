However, constraint satisfaction comes in practice as a computation problem where the focus is either on finding one solution, or on enumerating all solutions, possibly projected over some given set of output variables. The paper investigates the structural tractability of the problem of enumerating (possibly projected) solutions, where tractability means here computable with polynomial delay (WPD), since in general exponentially many solutions may be computed. A general framework based on the notion of tree projection of hypergraphs is considered, which generalizes all known decomposition methods. Tractability results have been obtained both for classes of structures where output variables are part of their specification, and for classes of structures where computability WPD must be ensured for any possible set of output variables. These results are shown to be tight, by exhibiting dichotomies for classes of structures having bounded arity and where the tree decomposition method is considered.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 May 2010 14:46:29 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1567v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 14:05:01 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1567v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["gianluigi greco", "francesco scarcello"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.1567"}
