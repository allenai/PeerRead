      "text" : "Knowledge graphs such as Wordnet (Miller 1995) and Freebase (Bollacker et al. 2008) play an important role in AI researches and applications. Recent researches such as query expansion prefer involving knowledge graphs (Bao et al. 2014) while some industrial applications such as question answering robots are also powered by knowledge graphs (Fader, Zettlemoyer, and Etzioni 2014). However, knowledge graphs are symbolic and logical, where numerical machine learning methods could hardly be applied. This disadvantage is one of the most important challenges for the usage of knowledge graph. To provide a general paradigm to support computing on knowledge graph, various knowledge graph embedding methods have been proposed, such as TransE (Bordes et al. 2013), TransH (Wang et al. 2014) and TransR (Lin et al. 2015).\nEmbedding is a novel approach to address the representation and reasoning problem for knowledge graph. It transforms entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, where knowledge graph completion and knowledge classification can be done. Most commonly, knowledge graph is composed by triples (h, r, t) where a head entity h, a relation r and a tail entity t are presented. Among all the proposed embedding approaches, geometry-based methods are an important branch, yielding the state-of-the-art predictive\nCopyright c© 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The navy crosses are the matched tail entities for an actor’s award nominee, while the red circles are the unmatched ones. TransE applies Euclidean metric and spherical equipotential surfaces, so it must make seven mistakes as (a) shows. Whilst TransA takes advantage of adaptive Mahalanobis metric and elliptical equipotential surfaces in (b), four mistakes are avoided.\nperformance. More specifically, geometry-based embedding methods represent an entity or a relation as k-dimensional vector, then define a score function fr(h, t) to measure the plausibility of a triple (h, r, t). Such approaches almost follow the same geometric principle h+ r ≈ t and apply the same loss metric ||h+ r− t||22 but differ in the relation space where a head entity h connects to a tail entity t.\nHowever, the loss metric in translation-based models is oversimplified. This flaw makes the current embedding methods incompetent to model various and complex entities/relations in knowledge base.\nFirstly, due to the inflexibility of loss metric, current translation-based methods apply spherical equipotential hyper-surfaces with different plausibilities, where more near to the centre, more plausible the triple is. As illustrated in Fig.1, spherical equipotential hyper-surfaces are applied in (a), so it is difficult to identify the matched tail entities from the unmatched ones. As a common sense in knowledge graph, complex relations, such as one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many relations, always lead to complex embedding topologies. Though complex embedding situation is an urgent challenge, spherical equipotential hyper-surfaces are not flexible enough to characterise the topologies, making current translation-based methods incompetent for this task.\nSecondly, because of the oversimplified loss metric, current translation-based methods treat each dimension identically. This observation leads to a flaw illustrated in Fig.2. As each dimension is treated identically in (a)1, the incorrect entities are matched, because they are closer than the correct ones, measured by isotropic Euclidean distance. Therefore,\n1The dash lines indicate the x-axis component of the loss (hx+ rx − tx) and the y-axis component of the loss (hy + ry − ty).\nFigure 2: Specific illustration of weighting dimensions. The data are selected from Wordnet. The solid dots are correct matches while the circles are not. The arrows indicate HasPart relation. (a) The incorrect circles are matched, due to the isotropic Euclidean distance. (b) By weighting embedding dimensions, we up-weighted y-axis component of loss and down-weighted x-axis component of loss, thus the embeddings are refined because the correct ones have smaller loss in x-axis direction.\nwe have a good reason to conjecture that a relation could only be affected by several specific dimensions while the other unrelated dimensions would be noisy. Treating all the dimensions identically involves much noises and degrades the performance.\nMotivated by these two issues, in this paper, we propose TransA, an embedding method by utilizing an adaptive and flexible metric. First, TransA applies elliptical surfaces instead of spherical surfaces. By this mean, complex embedding topologies induced by complex relations could be represented better. Then, as analysed in “Adaptive Metric Approach”, TransA could be treated as weighting transformed feature dimensions. Thus, the noise from unrelated dimensions is suppressed. We demonstrate our ideas in Fig.1 (b) and Fig.2 (b).\nTo summarize, TransA takes the adaptive metric ideas for better knowledge representation. Our method effectively models various and complex entities/relations in knowledge base, and outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines with significant improvements in experiments.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: we survey the related researches and then introduce our approach, along with the theoretical analysis. Next, the experiments are present and at the final part, we summarize our paper."

      "text" : "All the translation-based methods share a common principle h+ r ≈ t, but differ in defining the relation-related space where a head entity h connects to a tail entity t. This principle indicates that t should be the nearest neighbour of (h+ r). Hence, the translation-based methods all have the same form of score function that applies Euclidean distance to measure the loss, as follows:\nfr(h, t) = ||hr + r− tr|| 2 2\nwhere hr, tr are the entity embedding vectors projected in the relation-specific space. Note that this branch of methods keeps the state-of-the-art performance.\n• TransE (Bordes et al. 2013) lays the entities in the original space, say hr = h, tr = t.\n• TransH (Wang et al. 2014) projects the entities into a hyperplane for addressing the issue of complex relation embedding, say hr = h−w⊤r hwr, tr = t−w ⊤ r twr.\n• TransR (Lin et al. 2015) transforms the entities by the same matrix to also address the issue of complex relation embedding, as: hr = Mrh, tr = Mrt.\nProjecting entities into different hyperplanes or transforming entities by different matrices allow entities to play different roles under different embedding situations. However, as the “Introduction” argues, these methods are incompetent to model complex knowledge graphs well and particularly perform unsatisfactorily in various and complex entities/relations situation, because of the oversimplified metric.\nTransM (Fan et al. 2014) pre-calculates the distinct weight for each training triple to perform better."

      "heading" : "Other Embedding Methods",
      "text" : "There are also many other models for knowledge graph embedding.\nUnstructured Model (UM). The UM (Bordes et al. 2012) is a simplified version of TransE by setting all the relation vectors to zero r = 0. Obviously, relation is not considered in this model.\nStructured Embedding (SE). The SE model (Bordes et al. 2011) applies two relation-related matrices, one for head and the other for tail. The score function is defined as fr(h, t) = ||Mh,rh−Mt,rt|| 2 2. According to (Socher et al. 2013), this model cannot capture the relationship among entities and relations.\nSingle Layer Model (SLM). SLM applies neural network to knowledge graph embedding. The score function is defined as\nfr(h, t) = u ⊤ r g(Mr,1h+Mr,2t)\nNote that SLM is a special case of NTN when the zero tensors are applied. (Collobert and Weston 2008) had proposed a similar method but applied this approach into the language model.\nSemantic Matching Energy (SME). The SME model (Bordes et al. 2012) (Bordes et al. 2014) attempts to capture the correlations between entities and relations by matrix product and Hadamard product. The score functions are defined as follows:\nfr = (M1h+M2r+ b1) ⊤(M3t+M4r+ b2)\nfr = (M1h⊗M2r+ b1) ⊤(M3t⊗M4r+ b2)\nwhere M1,M2,M3 and M4 are weight matrices, ⊗ is the Hadamard product, b1 and b2 are bias vectors. In some recent work (Bordes et al. 2014), the second form of score function is re-defined with 3-way tensors instead of matrices.\nLatent Factor Model (LFM). The LFM (Jenatton et al. 2012) uses the second-order correlations between entities by a quadratic form, defined as fr(h, t) = h⊤Wrt.\nNeural Tensor Network (NTN). The NTN model (Socher et al. 2013) defines an expressive score function for graph embedding to joint the SLM and LFM.\nfr(h, t) = u ⊤ r g(h⊤W··rt+Mr,1h+Mr,2t+ br)\nwhere ur is a relation-specific linear layer, g(·) is the tanh function, Wr ∈ Rd×d×k is a 3-way tensor. However, the high complexity of NTN may degrade its applicability to large-scale knowledge bases.\nRESCAL. is a collective matrix factorization model as a common embedding method. (Nickel, Tresp, and Kriegel 2011) (Nickel, Tresp, and Kriegel 2012).\nSemantically Smooth Embedding (SSE). (Guo et al. 2015) aims at leveraging the geometric structure of embedding space to make entity representations semantically smooth.\n(Wang et al. 2014) jointly embeds knowledge and texts. (Wang, Wang, and Guo 2015) involves the rules into embedding. (Lin, Liu, and Sun 2015) considers the paths of knowledge graph into embedding."

      "heading" : "Adaptive Metric Score Function",
      "text" : "As mentioned in “Introduction”, all the translation-based methods obey the same principle h+ r ≈ t, but they differ in the relation-specific spaces where entities are projected into. Thus, such methods share a similar score function.\nfr(h, t) = ||h+ r− t|| 2 2\n= (h+ r− t)⊤(h+ r− t) (1)\nThis score function is actually Euclidean metric. The disadvantages of the oversimplified metric have been discussed in “Introduction”. As a consequence, the proposed TransA replaces inflexible Euclidean distance with adaptive Mahalanobis distance of absolute loss, because Mahalanobis distance is more flexible and more adaptive (Wang and Sun 2014). Thus, our score function is as follows:\nfr(h, t) = (|h+ r− t|) ⊤ Wr(|h+ r− t|) (2)\nwhere |h+ r− t| . = (|h1+r1− t1|, |h2+r2− t2|, ..., |hn+ rn − tn|) and Wr is a relation-specific symmetric nonnegative weight matrix that corresponds to the adaptive metric. Different from the traditional score functions, we take the absolute value, since we want to measure the absolute loss between (h+ r) and t. Furthermore, we would list two main reasons for the applied absolute operator.\nOn one hand, the absolute operator makes the score function as a well-defined norm only under the condition that all the entries of Wr are non-negative. A welldefined norm is necessary for most metric learning scenes (Kulis 2012), and the non-negative condition could be achieved more easily than PSD, so it generalises the common metric learning algebraic form for better rendering the knowledge topologies. Expanding our score function as an induced norm Nr(e) = √\nfr(h, t) where e . = h+ r− t. Obviously,Nr is non-negative, identical and absolute homogeneous. Besides with the easy-to-verified inequality Nr(e1 + e2) = √ |e1 + e2|⊤Wr|e1 + e2| ≤\n√ |e1|⊤Wr|e1|+ √\n|e2|⊤Wr|e2| = Nr(e1)+Nr(e2), the triangle inequality is hold. Totally, absolute operators make the metric a norm with an easy-to-achieve condition, helping to generalise the representation ability.\nOn the other hand, in geometry, negative or positive values indicate the downward or upward direction, while in our approach, we do not consider this factor. Let’s see an instance as shown in Fig.2. For the entity Goniff, the x-axis component of its loss vector is negative, thus enlarging this component would make the overall loss smaller, while this case is supposed to make the overall loss larger. As a result, absolute operator is critical to our approach. For a numerical example without absolute operator, when the embedding dimension is two, weight matrix is [0 1; 1 0] and the loss vector (h+ r− t) = (e1, e2), the overall loss would be 2e1e2. If e1 ≥ 0 and e2 ≤ 0, much absolute larger e2 would reduce the overall loss and this is not desired."

      "heading" : "Perspective from Equipotential Surfaces",
      "text" : "TransA shares almost the same geometric explanations with other translation-based methods, but they differ in the loss metric. For other translation-based methods, the equipotential hyper-surfaces are spheres as the Euclidean distance defines:\n||(t− h)− r||22 = C (3)\nwhere C means the threshold or the equipotential value. However, for TransA, the equipotential hyper-surfaces are elliptical surfaces as the Mahalanobis distance of absolute loss states (Kulis 2012):\n|(t− h)− r|⊤Wr|(t− h)− r| = C (4)\nNote that the elliptical hyper-surfaces would be distorted a bit as the absolute operator applied, but this makes no difference for analysing the performance of TransA. As we know, different equipotential hyper-surfaces correspond to different thresholds and different thresholds decide whether the triples are correct or not. Due to the practical situation that our knowledge base is large-scale and very complex, the topologies of embedding cannot be distributed as uniform as spheres, justified by Fig.1. Thus, replacing the spherical equipotential hyper-surfaces with the elliptical ones would enhance the embedding.\nAs Fig.1 illustrated, TransA would perform better for oneto-many relations. The metric of TransA is symmetric, so it is reasonable that TransA would also perform better for many-to-one relations. Moreover, a many-to-many relation could be treated as both a many-to-one and a one-to-many relation. Generally, TransA would perform better for all the complex relations."

Furthermore, Dr = diag(w1, w2, w3....) is a diagonal matrix and different embedding dimensions are weighted by wi.\nAs analysed in “Introduction”, a relation could only be affected by several specific dimensions while the other dimensions would be noisy. Treating different dimensions identically in current translation-based methods can hardly suppress the noise, consequently working out an unsatisfactory performance. We believe that different dimensions play different roles, particularly when entities are distributed divergently. Unlike existing methods, TransA can automatically learn the weights from the data. This may explain why TransA outperforms TransR although both TransA and TransR transform the entity space with matrices."

Experiments are conducted on four public datasets that are the subsets of Wordnet and Freebase. The statistics of these datasets are listed in Tab.1.\nATPE is short for “Averaged Triple number Per Entity”. This quantity measures the diversity and complexity of datasets. Commonly, more triples lead to more complex structures of knowledge graph. To express the more complex structures, entities would be distributed variously and complexly. Overall, embedding methods produce less satisfactory results in the datasets with higher ATPE, because a large ATPE means a various and complex entities/relations embedding situation."

      "heading" : "Link Prediction",
      "text" : "Link prediction aims to predict a missing entity given the other entity and the relation. In this task, we predict t given (h, r, ∗), or predict h given (∗, r, t). The WN18 and FB15K datasets are the benchmark datasets for this task.\nEvaluation Protocol. We follow the same protocol as used in TransE (Bordes et al. 2013), TransH (Wang et al. 2014) and TransR (Lin et al. 2015). For each testing triple (h, r, t), we replace the tail t by every entity e in the knowledge graph and calculate a dissimilarity score with the score function fr(h, e) for the corrupted triple (h, r, e). Ranking these scores in ascending order, we then get the rank of the original correct triple. There are two metrics for evaluation: the averaged rank (Mean Rank) and the proportion of testing triples, whose ranks are not larger than 10 (HITS@10). This is called “Raw” setting. When we filter out the corrupted triples that exist in all the training, validation and test datasets, this is the“Filter” setting. If a corrupted triple exists in the knowledge graph, ranking it before the original triple is acceptable. To eliminate this issue, the “Filter” setting is more preferred. In both settings, a lower Mean Rank or a higher HITS@10 is better.\nImplementation. As the datasets are the same, we directly copy the experimental results of several baselines from the literature, as in (Bordes et al. 2013), (Wang et al.\n2014) and (Lin et al. 2015). We have tried several settings on the validation dataset to get the best configuration for both Adaptive Metric (PSD) and TransA. Under the “bern.” sampling strategy, the optimal configurations are: learning rate α = 0.001, embedding dimension k = 50, γ = 2.0, C = 0.2 on WN18; α = 0.002, k = 200, γ = 3.2, and C = 0.2 on FB15K.\nResults. Evaluation results on WN18 and FB15K are reported in Tab.2 and Tab.3, respectively. We can conclude that:\n1. TransA outperforms all the baselines significantly and consistently. This result justifies the effectiveness of TransA.\n2. FB15K is a very various and complex entities/relations embedding situation, because its ATPE is absolutely highest among all the datasets. However, TransA performs better than other baselines on this dataset, indicating that TransA performs better in various and complex entities/relations embedding situation. WN18 may be less complex than FB15K because of a smaller ATPE. Compared to TransE, the relative improvement of TransA on WN18 is 5.7% while that on FB15K is 95.2%. This comparison shows TransA has more advantages in the various and complex embedding environment.\n3. TransA promotes the performance for 1-1 relations, which means TransA generally promotes the performance on simple relations. TransA also promotes the performance for 1-N, N-1, N-N relations3, which demonstrates TransA works better for complex relation embedding.\n4. Compared to TransR, better performance of TransA means the feature weighting and the generalised metric form leaded by absolute operators, have significant benefits, as analysed.\n5. Compared to Adaptive Metric (PSD) which applies the score function fr(h, t) = (h+ r− t)⊤Wr(h+ r− t) and constrains Wr as PSD, TransA is more competent,\n2ATPE:Averaged Triple number Per Entity.

TransA performs bad in Mean Rank on WN18 dataset. Digging into the detailed situation, we discover there are 27 testing triples (0.54% of the testing set) whose ranks are more than 30,000, and these few cases would make about 162 mean rank loss. The tail or head entity of all these triples have never been co-occurring with the corresponding relation in the training set. It is the insufficient training data that leads to the over-distorted weight matrix and the over-distorted weight matrix is responsible for the bad Mean Rank."

Among these attempts, translation-based methods build entity and relation vectors by minimizing the translation loss from a head entity to a tail one. In spite of the success of these methods, translation-based methods also suffer from the oversimplified loss metric, and are not competitive enough to model various and complex entities/relations in knowledge bases. To address this issue, we propose TransA, an adaptive metric approach for embedding, utilizing the metric learning ideas to provide a more flexible embedding method. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets and our proposed method makes significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.",
