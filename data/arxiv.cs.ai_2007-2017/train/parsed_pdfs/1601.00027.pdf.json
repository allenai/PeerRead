      "text" : "The histological assessment of human tissue has emerged as the key challenge for detection and treatment of cancer. A plethora of different data sources ranging from tissue microarray data to gene expression, proteomics or metabolomics data provide a detailed overview of the health status of a patient. Medical doctors need to assess these information sources and they rely on data driven automatic analysis tools. Methods for classification, grouping and segmentation of heterogeneous data sources as well as regression of noisy dependencies and estimation of survival probabilities enter the processing workflow of a pathology diagnosis system at various stages.

      "text" : "Modern pathology studies of biopsy tissue encompass multiple stainings of histological material, genomics and proteomics analyses as well as comparative statistical analyses of patient data. Pathology lays not only a scientific foundation for clinical medicine but also serves as a bridge between the fundamental sciences in natural science, medicine and patient care. Therefore, it can be viewed as one of the key hubs for translational research in the health and life sciences, subsequently facilitating translational medicine. In particular, the abundance of heterogeneous data sources with a substantial amount of randomness and noise poses challenging problems for statistics and machine learning. Automatic processing of this wealth of data\npromises a standardized and hopefully more objective diagnosis of the disease state of a patient than manual inspection can provide today. An automatic computational pathology pipeline also enables the medical user to quantitatively benchmark the processing pipeline and to identify error sensitive processing steps which can substantially degrade the final prediction of survival times."

      "text" : "Throughout this review we use Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as a disease case to design and optimize a computational pathology framework because it exhibits a number of properties which are highly relevant for computational pathology.\nRenal cell carcinoma figures as one of the ten most frequent malignancies in the statistics of Western societies [1]. The prognosis of renal cancer is poor since many patients suffer already from metastases at the time of first diagnosis. The identification of biomarkers for prediction of prognosis (prognostic marker) or response to therapy (predictive marker) is therefore of utmost importance to improve patient prognosis [2]. Various prognostic markers have been suggested in the past [3, 4], but estimates of conventional morphological parameters still provide most valuable information for therapeutical decisions.\nClear cell RCC (ccRCC) emerged as the most common subtype of renal cancer and it is composed of cells with clear cytoplasm and typical vessel architecture. ccRCC exhibits an architecturally diverse histological structure, with solid, alveolar and acinar patterns. The carcinomas typically contain a regular network of small thin-walled blood vessels, a diagnostically helpful char-\nacteristic of this tumor. Most ccRCC show areas with hemorrhage or necrosis (Fig. 2d), whereas an inflammatory response is infrequently observed. Nuclei tend to be round and uniform with finely granular and evenly distributed chromatin. Depending upon the grade of malignancy, nucleoli may be inconspicuous and small, or large and prominent, with possibly very large nuclei or bizarre nuclei occurring [1].\nThe prognosis for patients with RCC depends mainly on the pathological stage and the grade of the tumor at the time of surgery. Other prognostic parameters include proliferation rate of tumor cells and different gene expression patterns. Tannapfel et al. [2] have shown that cellular proliferation potentially serves as another measure for predicting biological aggressiveness and, therefore, for estimating the prognosis. Immunohistochemical assessment of the MIB-1 (Ki-67) antigen indicates that MIB-1 immunostaining (Fig. 2d) is an additional prognostic parameter for patient outcome. TMAs were highly representative of proliferation index and histological grade using bladder cancer tissue [5].\nThe TNM staging system specifies the local extension of the primary tumour (T), the involvement of regional lymph nodes (N), and the presence of distant metastases (M) as indicators of the disease state. [6] focuses on reassessing the current TNM staging system for RCC and concludes that outcome prediction for\n2 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nRCC remains controversial. Although many parameters have been tested for prognostic significance, only a few have achieved general acceptance in clinical practice. An especially interesting observation of [6] is that multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models including multiple clinical and pathologic covariates were more accurate in predicting patient outcome than the TNM staging system. On one hand this finding demonstrates the substantial difficulty of the task and on the other hand it is a motivation for research in computational pathology to develop robust machine learning frameworks for reliable and objective prediction of disease progression."

      "heading" : "2.2. Tissue Microarrays",
      "text" : "The tissue microarray (TMA) technology significantly accelerated studies seeking for associations between molecular changes and clinical endpoints [7]. In this technology, 0.6mm tissue cylinders are extracted from primary tumor material of hundreds of different patients and these cylinders are subsequently embedded into a recipient tissue block. Sections from such array blocks can then be used for simultaneous in situ analysis of hundreds or thousands of primary tumors on DNA, RNA, and protein level (cf. 2). These results can then be integrated with expression profile data which is expected to enhance the diagnosis and prognosis of ccRCC [8, 3, 9]. The high speed of arraying, the lack of a significant damage to donor blocks, and the regular arrangement of arrayed specimens substantially facilitates automated analysis.\nAlthough the production of tissue microarrays is an almost routine task for most laboratories, the evaluation of stained tissue microarray slides remains tedious human annotation work, it is time consuming and prone to error. Furthermore, the significant intratumoral heterogeneity of RCC results in high interobserver variability. The variable architecture of RCC also results in a difficult assessment of prognostic parameters. Current image analysis software requires extensive user interaction to properly identify cell populations, to select regions of interest for scoring, to optimize analysis parameters and to organize the resulting raw data. Because of these drawbacks in current software, pathologists typically collect tissue microarray data by manually assigning a composite staining score for each spot - often during multiple microscopy sessions over a period of days. Such manual scoring can result in serious inconsistencies between data collected during different microscopy sessions. Manual scoring also introduces a significant bottleneck that hinders the use of tissue microarrays in high-throughput analysis."

      "heading" : "2.3. Analyzing Pathologists",
      "text" : "To assess the inter and intra variability of pathologists we designed three different labeling experiments for the major tasks involved in TMA analysis. To facilitate the labeling process for trained pathologists we developed software suite which allows the user to view single TMA spots and which provides zooming and scrolling capabilities. The expert can annotate the image with vectorial data in SVG (support vector graphics) format and he/she can mark cell nuclei, vessels and other biological structures. In addition each structure can be labeled with a class which is encoded by its color. To increase usability and the adoption in hospitals we specifically designed the software for tablet PC so that a pathologist can perform all operations with a pen alone\n3 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nin a simple and efficient manner. Figure 3 depicts the graphical user interfaces of the three applications.\nNuclei Detection: The most tedious labeling task is the detection of cell nuclei. In this experiment two experts on renal cell carcinoma exhaustively labeled a quarter of each of the 9 spots from the previous experiment. Overall each expert independently marked the center, the approximate radius and the class of more than 2000 nuclei. Again a tablet PC was used so it was possible to split up the work into several sessions and the experts could use the machine at their convenience. The user detects nuclei by marking the location with the pen on the tablet and indicates the diameter by moving the pen. A circular semi-transparent polygon is then drawn to mark the nucleus. The final step consists of choosing a class for the nucleus. In this setting it was either black for cancerous nuclei or red for normal ones. This task has to be repeated for each nucleus on each spot. Finally it is possible to show and hide the annotation to gain an overview over the original tissue. Figure 4 depicts a quarter of one of the RCC TMA spots together with the annotation and the inter expert disagreement.\nThe average precision of one pathologist compared to the other is 0.92 and the average recall amounts to 0.91. These performance numbers show that even detecting nuclei on an histological slide is by far not an easy or undisputed task.\nNuclei Classification: The third experiment was designed to evaluate the inter and intra pathologist variability for nuclei classification, i.e. determining if a nucleus is normal/benign or abnormal/malignant. This step crucially influences the final outcome due to the fact that the percentage of staining is only estimated on\nthe subset of cancerous nuclei. In the experiment, 180 randomly selected nuclei are sequentially presented in three different views of varying zoom stage. The query nucleus is indicated in each view with a red cross and the area which comprises the next zoom view is marked with a red bounding box (cf. Figure 3). During the setup phase the user can adjust these views to simulate his usual workflow as good as possible. During the experiment the expert has to select a class for each nucleus and rate his confidence. Thus, he has the choice between six buttons: tumor certainly, tumor probably, tumor maybe, benign certainly, benign probably and benign maybe. After classifying all nuclei, which have been classified as tumor, are displayed again and the pathologist has to estimate if the nucleus is stained or not. Again he has to rate his confidence in his own decision on a scale of three levels. To test the intra pathologist’s variability a subset of nuclei was queried twice but the images were flipped and rotated by 90 degree at the second display to hamper recognition.\nThe results for inter-pathologist variability for the binary classification task are plotted in Figure 5a. Out of 180 nuclei all five experts agreed on 24 nuclei to be normal and 81 nuclei to be ab-normal, respectively cancerous. For the other 75 nuclei (42%) the pathologists disagreed.\nThe analysis of the intra-pathologist error is shown in Figure 5b. The overall intra classification error is 21.2% This means that every fifth nucleus was classified by an expert first as cancerous and the second time as normal or vice versa. The self-assessment of confidence allows us also to analyze single pathologists. For example Figure 5c shows the results of a very self-confident pathologist who is always very certain of his decisions but ends\n4 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nA revised version of this manuscript was published in CMIG (PMID: 18982583).

Figure 5d on the other hand is the result of a very cautious expert who is rather unsure of his decision, but with a misclassification error of 18% he performs significantly better than the previous one. The important lesson learned is, that self-assessment is not a reliable information to learn from. The intuitive notion, to use only training samples which were classified with high confidence by domain experts is not valid.\nIn defense of human pathologist it has to be mentioned that these experiments represent the most general way to conduct a TMA analysis and analogous studies in radiology report similar results [10, 11]. In practice, domain experts focus only on regions of TMA spots which are very well processed, which have no staining artifacts or which are not blurred. The nuclei analyzed in this experiment were randomly sampled from the whole set of detected nuclei to mimic the same precondition which an algorithm would encounter in routine work. Reducing the analysis to perfectly processes regions would most probably decrease the intrapathologist error.\nStaining Estimation: The most common task in manual TMA analysis requires to estimate the staining. To this end a domain expert views the spot of a patients for several seconds and estimates the number of stained abnormal cells without resorting to actual nuclei counting. This procedure is iterated for each spot on a TMAslide to get an estimate for each patient in the study.\nIt is important to note that, due to the lack of competitive algorithms, the results of nearly all TMA studies are based on this kind of subjective estimations.\nTo investigate estimation consistency we presented 9 randomly selected TMA spots to 14 trained pathologists of the University Hospital Zurich.\nThe estimations of the experts varied by up to 20% as\nshown in Figure 6b. As depicted in Figure 6b the standard deviation between the experts grows linearly with the average estimated amount of staining. The high variability demonstrates the subjectivity of the estimation process. This uncertainty is especially critical for types of cancer for which the clinician chooses the therapy based on the estimated staining percentage. This result not only motivates but emphasizes the need for more objective estimation procedures than current practice. Our research is stimulated by the hope, that computational pathology approaches do not only automated such estimation processes but also produce better reproduceable and more objective results than human judgment."

A comprehensive study evaluating the performance of domain experts regarding the detection of lymphocytes is presented by [12]. In a best case, a medium-skilled expert needs on average one hour for analyzing a fluorescence micrograph. Each micrograph contains between 100 and 400 cells and is of size 658 × 517 pixel. Four exemplary micrographs were blindly evaluated by five experts. To evaluate the inter-observer variability nattkemper et al.

Although fluorescence images appear to be easier to analyze due to their homo-\n5 Preprint, June 29, 2010\ngeneous background, this high detection error indicates the difficulty of this analysis task.

      "text" : "The main benefit of labeling experiments like the ones described before, is not to point out the high inter and intra variability between pathologists, but to generate a gold standard. In absence of an objective ground truth measurement process, a gold standard is crucial for the use of statistical learning, first for learning a classifier or regressor and second for validating the statistical model.\nSection 5 shows an example how the information gathered in the experiments of Section 2.3 can be used to train a computational pathology system.\nBesides labeling application which are developed for specific scenarios as the one described in Section 2.3 several other possibilities exist to acquire data in pathology in a structured manner. Although software for tablet PCs is the most convenient approach to gather information directly in the hospital it is limited by the low number of test subjects which can complete an experiment. To overcome this limitation the number of labelers can be extended significantly by the use of web-based technologies.\nCrowd-sourcing services like Amazon Mechanical Turk can be used to gather large numbers of labels\nat a low cost. Applications in pathology suffer from the main problem, that the labelers are all non-experts. While crowd-sourcing works well for task based on natural images [13], it poses a considerable problems in pathology where for example the decision if a nucleus is normal or cancerous is based on complicated criteria [14] which require medical training and knowledge. Likewise the recognition of some supercellular morphological structures requires years of training and supervision. Nevertheless crowd-sourcing could be useful in simple detection tasks like finding nuclei in histological slides."

If this condition is met, Y and X = {x1, . . . , xn} can be used for classifier learning and evaluation.\nUnfortunately, for a large number of real word application ground truth is either not available or very expensive to acquire. In practice, as a last resort, one would ask several domain experts for their opinion about each object xi in question to generate a gold standard as described in Section 2.5.

Nuclei which were labeled only by pathologist one are shown in blue and the nuclei found only by expert two are depicted in red.\nthe task and the experience of the experts this questioning often results in an ambiguous labeling due to disagreement between experts. In pathology, very challenging scenarios, like assessing the malignancy of a cell, not only the inter, but also the intra expert variability is quite large (cf. Section 2.3). Moreover, restricting the dataset to the subset of consistently labeled samples results in loss of the majority of data in these scenarios.\nConsequently, such a data acquisition procedure poses a fundamental problem for supervised learning. Especially in computational pathology there is clearly a need for novel algorithms to address the labeling problem and to provide methods to validate models under such circumstances.\nMore formally, each yi is replaced by a D dimensional vector ȳi = {y1i , . . . , yDi }, where ydi represents the i-th label of domain expert d. To this end one is interested in learning a classifier Φ(X, Ȳ) from the design matrix X and the labeling matrix Ȳ . To date it is an open research question, how such classifier Φ(X, Ȳ) should be formulated.\nRecently [15, 16] presented promising results based on expectation maximization where the hidden ground\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 7: Labeling matrix with majority vote (a) and confidence matrix with confidence average (b) of five domain experts classifying 180 ccRCC nuclei into cancerous (red) and benign (green).\ntruth is estimated in turn with the confidence in the experts. Also along this lines [17] introduced a probabilistic model to simultaneously infer the label of images, the expertise of each labeler, and the difficulty of each image. An application for diabetes especially for detecting hard exudates in eye fundus images was published by [18].\nAlthough a number of theoretical results exist [19, 20, 21], empirical evidence is still lacking to establish that these approaches are able to improve over simple majority voting [22, 23] in real world applications.\nA further, promising line of research investigates the question if such a classifier Φ(X, Ȳ) can be learned in an on-line fashion, especially when the new labels come from a different domain expert. An affirmative answer would show a high impact in domains where specific models can be trained for years by a large number of experts, e.g. medical decision support.\nIn summary, extending supervised learning to handle domain expert variability is an exciting challenge and promises direct impact on applications not only in pathology but in a variety of computer vision tasks where generating a gold standard poses a highly non trivial challenge."

Although a comprehensive archive like the UCI machine learning repository [24] does not exist for computational pathology, there are a number of datasets and initiatives which disseminate various kinds of data.\nImmunohistochemistry: The most comprehensive database for antibodies and human tissue is by far the Human Protein Atlas [25, 26]. Comprising spots from tissue micro arrays of 45 normal human tissue types, it\n7 Preprint, June 29, 2010\ncontains anywhere from 0−6 images for each protein in each tissue type. The images are roughly 3000 × 3000 pixels in size, with each pixel approximately representing a 0.5 × 0.5µm region on the microscopy slide.\nA segmentation benchmark for various tissue types in bioimaging was compiled by [27], including 58 histopathological H&E stained images of breast cancer. The dataset provides labels from a single expert for the tasks of segmentation and cell counting.\nCytology: Automation in cytology is the oldest and most advanced branch in the field of image processing in pathology. Reason therefore are that digital imaging is rather straightforward and that single cells on a homogeneous background are more easily detected and segmented than in tissue. As a result commercial solutions are available since decades. Nevertheless especially the classification of detected and segmented nuclei still poses large difficulties for computational approaches. [28] published ten color microscopic images from serous cytology with hand segmentation labels. For bronchial cytology [29] provide eight color microscopic images. Ground truth information for three classes (nucleus, cytoplasm, and background pixels) is also available for each image. Pixels have a label specifying their classes (2: nucleus, 1: cytoplasm, 0: background). A dataset of 3900 cells has been extracted from microscopical image (serous cytology) by [30]. This database has been classified into 18 cellular categories by experts.\nFluorescence Microscopy: A hand-segmented set of 97 fluorescence microscopy images with a total of 4009 cells has been published by [31]. For fluorescence microscopy, the simulation of cell population images is an interesting addition to validation with manual labels of domain experts. [12, 32] present simulation frameworks for synthetically generated cell population images. The advantage of these techniques is the possibility to control parameters like cell density, illumination and the probability of cells clustering together. [32] supports also the simulation of various cell textures and different error sources. The obvious disadvantage are (i) that the model can only simulate what it knows and therefore can not represent the whole variability of biological cell images and (ii) that these methods can only simulate cell cultures without morphological structure. The later disadvantage also prevents their use in tissue analysis. Although the thought of simulated tissue images in light microscopy is appealing, currently there does not exist methods which could even remotely achieve that goal."

Recently, [37] presented a framework for segmentation based on morphological clustering of bivariate color histograms and [38] devised an iterative morphological algorithm for nuclei segmentation.\nBesides common computer vision tasks like object detection, segmentation and recognition, histopathological imaging poses domain specific problems such as estimating staining of nuclei conglomerates [39] and differentiation nuclei by their shape [40]."

      "text" : "Brightfield microscopic imaging often produces large differences of illumination within single slides or TMA spots. These variations are caused by the varying thickness of the slide or by imperfect staining. Such problems can be overcome either by preprocessing the image data or by designing and integrating invariance into the algorithmic processing to compensate for these variations.\nInconsistencies in the preparation of histology slides render it difficult to perform a quantitative analysis on their results. An normalization approach based on optical density and SVD projection is proposed by [41] for overcoming some of the known inconsistencies in the staining process. Slides which were processed or stored\n8 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nunder very different conditions are projected into a common, normalized space to enable improved quantitative analysis.\nPreprocessing and normalization methods usually not only reduce noise induced differences between samples but often also eliminate the biological signal of interest. As an alternative to such an irreparable information loss during data acquisition, algorithms with illumination invariance or with compensation of staining artifacts are designed which are robust to these uncontrollable experimental variations.\nRelational Detection Forests [42] provide one possibility to overcome this problem of information loss. Especially designed for detection of cell nuclei in histological slides, they are based on the concept of randomized trees [43]. The features, which are selected for this framework center around the idea that relation between features are more robust than thresholds on single features. A similar idea was applied by [44] to gene chip analysis where similar problems occur, due to the background noise of different labs. Contrary to the absolute values the relation between DNA expression is rather robust.\nObject detection is commonly solved by training a classifier on patches centered at the objects of interest [45], e.g., the cell nuclei in medical image processing of histological slides. Considering only the relation between rectangles within these patches results in illumination invariant features which give the same response for high and low contrast patches as long as the shape of the object is preserved. It has to be noted, that due to the directionality of the relation they fail if the image is inverted. In general, illumination invariance speeds up the whole analysis process because neither image normalization nor histogram equalization are required.\nThe feature base proposed in [42] is defined as follows: The coordinates of two rectangles R1 and R2 are sampled uniformly within a predefined window size w:\nRi = {cx1, cy1, cx2, cy2}, ci ∼ U(x|0,w)\nFor each rectangle the intensities of the underlying gray scale image are summed up and normalized by the area of the rectangle. The feature f (s,R1,R2) evaluates to a boolean value by comparing these quantities:\nf (s,R1,R2) =  1 if ∑ i|xi∈R1 xi n1 < ∑ i|xi∈R2 xi n2 0 otherwise (1)\nwhere xi is the gray value intensity of pixel i of sample s = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} and n1, n2 denote the number of samples in R1,R2, respectively. From a general point of\nview this definition is similar to generalized Haar features but there are two main differences: (i) the quantity of interest is not the continuous difference between the rectangles but the boolean relation between them and hence (ii) it is not necessary to learn a threshold on the difference to binarize the feature.\nFor example, in the validation experiments a window size of 65 × 65 pixels was chosen. Taking into account that rectangles are flipping invariant, this results in ( (644)/4\n)2 ≈ 2 · 1013 possible features. Putting this into perspective, the restriction of the detector to windows of size 24×24 leads to ∼ 6.9·109 features which are significantly more than the 45, 396 Haar features from classical object detection approaches [45].\nFor such huge feature spaces it is currently not possible to exhaustively evaluate all features while training a classifier. Approaches like AdaBoost [46] which yield very good results for up to hundreds of thousands of features are not applicable any more. These problems can be overcome by employing randomized algorithms [42, 47] where features are sampled randomly for learning classifiers on these random projections."

Not only that staining protocols and slide scanners are constantly updated and changed but common algorithms like the quantification of proliferation factors have to work robustly on various tissue types. The detection of multiple objects like nuclei in noisy images without an explicit model is still one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision. Methods which can be applied in an plug-and-play manner are not available to date.\n[48] present an inter-active ensemble learning algorithm based on randomized trees, which can be employed to learn an object detector in an inter-active fashion. In addition this learning method can cope with high dimensional feature spaces in an efficient manner and in contrast to classical approaches, subspaces are not split based on thresholds but by learning relations between features.\nIncorporating the knowledge of domain experts into the process of learning statistical models poses one of the main challenges in machine learning [49] and computer vision. Data analysis applications in pathology share properties of online and active learning which can be termed inter-active learning. The domain expert interferes with the learning process by correcting falsely\n9 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nclassified samples. Algorithm 9 sketches an overview of the inter-active learning process.\nIn recent years online learning has been of major interest to a large variety of scientific fields. From the viewpoint of machine learning [50] summarizes a comprehensive overview of existing methods and open challenges. In computer vision online boosting has been successfully applied to car detection [51], video surveillance [52] and visual tracking [53]. One of the first inter-active frameworks was developed by [54] and applied to pedestrian detection.\nEnsemble methods like boosting [46] and random forests [55, 43] celebrated success in a large variety of tasks in statistical learning but in most cases they are only applied offline. Lately, online ensemble learning for boosting and bagging was investigated by [56] and [57]. The online random forest as proposed by [58] incrementally adopts new features. Updating decision trees with new samples was described by [59, 60] and extended by [61, 62]. Update schemes for pools of experts like the WINNOW and Weighted Majority Algorithm were introduced by [63, 64] and successfully employed since then.\nIn many, not only medical domains, accurate and robust object detection specifies a crucial step in data analysis pipelines. In pathology for example, the detection of cell nuclei on histological slides serves as the basis for a larger number of tasks such as immunohistochemical staining estimation and morphological grading. Results of medical interest such as survival prediction are sensitively influenced by the accuracy of the object detection algorithm. The diagnosis of the pathologist in turn leads to different treatment strategies and hence directly affects the patient. For most of these medical procedures the ground truth is not known (see Section 2) and for most problems biomedical science lacks orthogonal methods which could verify a considered hypotheses. Therefore, the subjective opinion of the medical doctor is the only gold standard available for training such decision support systems.\nIn such scenarios the subjective influence of a single human can be mitigated by combining the opinions of a larger number of experts. In practice consolidating expert judgments is a cumbersome and expensive process and often additional experts are not available at a given time. To overcome these problems online learning algorithms are capable of incorporating additional knowledge, so-called side-information, when it is available.\nIn an ideal clinical setting, a specialized algorithm for cell nuclei detection should be available for each subtype of cancer. By using and correcting the algorithm\nAlgorithm 1: Schematic workflow of an inter-active ensemble learning framework. The domain expert interacts with the algorithm to produce a classifier (object detector) which satisfies the conditions based on the experts domain knowledge.\nData: Unlabeled Instances U = {u1, . . . , un} 1 %(e.g. image) Input: Domain Expert E\nOutput: Ensemble Classifier C\n2 while (expert is unsatisfied with current result) do 3 classify all samples ui; 4 while (expert corrects falsely predicted sample ui with label li) do 5 update weights of the base classifiers 6 learn new base classifiers 7 end 8 end 9 return C\nseveral domain experts as its users continuously train and update the method. Thereby, the combined knowledge of a large number of experts and repeated training over a longer period of time yields more accurate and more robust classifiers than batch learning techniques.\nThe described setting differs from the conventional views of online learning and active learning insofar that new samples are neither chosen at random nor proposed for labeling by the algorithm itself. In addition, the adversary is not considered malicious but also not completely trustworthy. The domain expert reacts to the classification of unlabeled data and corrects wrongly classified instances. These preconditions lead to the success or failure of different combination rules.\nIt has to be noted, that these kind of machine learning approaches are in sharp contrast to classical rule bases expert systems [65] which are still used by a number of commercial medical imaging companies. For these applications the user has to be an image processing experts who chooses dozens of features and thresholds by hand to create a rule set adapted to the data. Contrary to that strategy, in an inter-active learning framework the user has to be a domain expert, in our case a trained pathologists. Feature extraction and learning of statistical models is performed by the algorithms so that the expert can concentrate on the biomedical problem at hand. Interactive learning frameworks like [51, 48] show promising results, but further research especially on long term learning and robustness is mandatory to estimate the reliability of these methods prior to an application in clin-\n10 Preprint, June 29, 2010\nical practice."

      "text" : "Multispectral imaging [66, 67] for immunohistochemically stained tissue and brightfield microscopy seems to be a promising technology although a number of limitations have to be kept in mind.\nTo date, double- or triple-staining of tissue samples on a single slide in brightfield (non-fluorescence) microscopy poses still a major challenge. Traditionally, double staining relied on chromogens, which have been selected to provide maximum color contrast for observation with the unaided eye. For visually good color combinations, however, technically feasible choices always include at least one diffuse chromogen, due to the lack of appropriate chromogen colors. Additional problems arise from spatial overlapping and from unclear mixing of colors. Currently, these problem are addressed by cutting serial sections and by staining each one with a different antibody and a single colored label. Unfortunately, localized information on a cell-by-cell basis is lost with this approach. In the absence of larger structures like glands, registration of sequential slices proved to be highly unreliable and often not feasible at all. Multispectral imaging yield single-cell-level multiplexed imaging of standard Immunohistochemistry in the same cellular compartment. This technique even works in the presence of a counterstain and each label can be unmixed into separate channels without bleedthrough.\nComputational pathology algorithms would profit from multispectral imaging also is experiments with single stains, due to the possibility to accurately separate the specific label signals from the background counterstain.\nPractical suggestions for immunoenzyme double staining procedures for frequently encountered antibody combinations like rabbitmouse, goatmouse, mousemouse, and rabbitrabbit are discussed in [67]. The suggested protocols are all suitable for a classical redbrown color combination plus blue nuclear counterstain. Although the red and brown chromogens do not contrast very well visually, they both show a crisp localization and can be unmixed by spectral imaging.\nDetection an segmentation of nuclei, glands or other structures constitute a crucial steps in various computational pathology frameworks. With the use of supervised machine learning techniques these tasks are often performed by trained classifiers which assign labels to single pixels. Naturally one can ask if MSI could improve this classification process and if the additional spectral bands contain additional information? A study\nconducted by [68] set out to answer this question in the scope of routine clinical histopathology imagery. They compared MSI stacks with RGB imagery with the use of several classifier ranging from linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to support vector machines (SVM). For H&E slide the results indicate performance differences of less than 1% using multispectral imagery as opposed to preprocessed RGB imagery. Using only single image bands for classification showed that the single best multispectral band (in the red portion of the spectrum) resulted in a performance increase of 0.57%, compared to the performance of the single best RGB band (red). Principal components analysis (PCA) of the multispectral imagery indicated only two significant image bands, which is not surprising given the presence of two stains. The results of [68] indicate that MSI provides minimal additional spectral information than would standard RGB imagery for routine H&E stained histopathology.\nAlthough the results of this study are convincing it has to be noted that only slides with two channels were analyzed. For triple and quadruple staining as described in [67] MSI could still encode additional information which should lead to a higher classification performance. Similar conclusions are drawn by [69], stating that MSI has significant potential to improve segmentation and classification accuracy either by incorporation of features computed across multiple wavelengths or by the addition of spectral unmixing algorithms.\nComplementary to supervised learning as described before, [70] proposed unsupervised blind source separation for extracting the contributions of various histological stains to the overall spectral composition throughout a tissue sample. As a preprocessing step all images of the multispectral stack were registered to each other considering affine transformations. Subsequently it was shown that Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [71] and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [72] compare favorable to Color Deconvolution [73]. Along the same lines [74] advocate principal component analysis (PCA) and blind source separation (BSS) to decompose hyperspectral images into spectrally homogeneous compounds.\nIn the domain of fluorescence imaging [75] give an overview of several source separation methods. The main difficulty stems from the significant overlap of the emission spectra even with the use of fluorescent dyes. To this end [76] conduct a study on more than 3500 images from the Human Protein Atlas [25, 26]. They concluded that subcellular locations can be determined with an accuracy of 87.5% by the use of support vector machines and random forests [55, 43]. Due to the spread of Type-2 diabetes there is growing interest in pancre-\n11 Preprint, June 29, 2010\natic islet segmentation and cell counting of α and β-cells [77]. An approach which is based on the strategies described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 is described in [78].\nIt is an appealing idea to apply source separation techniques not only to multispectral imaging but also to standard RGB images. This approach could be useful for a global staining estimation of the separate channels or as a preprocessing step for training a classifier. Unfortunately, antigen-antibody reactions are not stoichiometric. Hence the intensity/darkness of a stain does not necessarily correlate with the amount of reaction products. With the exception of Feulgen staining also most histological stains are not stoichiometric. [67] also state that the brown DAB reaction product is not a true absorber of light, but a scatterer of light, and has a very broad, featureless spectrum. This optical behavior implies that DAB does not follow the Beer-Lambert law, which describes the linear relationship between the concentration of a compound and its absorbance, or optical density. As a consequence, darkly stained DAB has a different spectral shape than lightly stained DAB. Therefore attempting to quantify DAB intensity using source separation techniques is not advisable. Contrary to this observation, employing a non-linear convolution algorithm as preprocessing for a linear classifier, e.g. for segmentation could be of benefit.\nFinally, multispectral imaging is not available for automated whole slide scanning which constrains its applicability. Imaging a TMA manually with a microscope and a MSI adapter is too tedious and time consuming."

The most common form of censoring is right censored data which means that the death of the patient is not observer during the runtime of the study or that the patient withdrew from the study, e.g. because he moved to another location.\nThe nonparametric Kaplan-Meier estimator [83] is frequently used to estimate the survival function from right censored data. This procedure requires first toorder the survival times from the smallest to the largest such that t1 ≤ t2 ≤ t3 ≤ . . . ≤ tn, where t j is the jth largest unique survival time. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function is then obtained as\nŜ (t) = ∏\nj:t( j)≤t\n( 1 −\nd j r j\n) (2)\nwhere r j is the number of individuals at risk just before t j, and d j is the number of individuals who die at time t j.\nTo measure the goodness of separation between two or more groups, the log-rank test (Mantel-Haenszel test) [84] is employed to assesses the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the survival experience of the individuals in the different groups.

A parametric approach to such an analysis involves the estimation of parameters of a probability density function which models time.\nIn general the distribution of a random variable T (representing time) is defined over the interval [0,∞). Furthermore, a standard survival function is specified based on the cumulative distribution over T as follows:\nS (t) = 1 − p(T ≤ t0) = 1 − ∫ t0\n0 p(t)dt, (4)\nwhich models the probability of an individual surviving up to time t0.

(5)\nThe model is further extended by considering the effect of covariates X on time via a regression component. In medical statistics the most popular method for modeling such effects is Cox’s proportionality hazards model [86]: h(t|x) = h0(t) exp(xTβ), (6) where h0(t) is the baseline hazard function, which is the chance of instant death given survival till time t, x is the vector of covariates and β are the regression coefficients."

Apart from flexibility, it is also the only distribution which captures both the accelerated time model and the proportionality hazards model [88]. The Weibull distribution is defined as follows:\np(t|αw, λw) = αw 1 λw tαw−1 exp ( − 1 λw tαw ) , (7)\nwhere αw and λw are the shape and scale parameters, respectively.

For example the vector x = {x1, x2, x3} can be expanded up to order 2 as x ′ = {x1, x2, x3, x1 : x2, x1 : x3, x2 : x3, x1 : x2 : x3}.

More recently [92] use a maximum likelihood approach to infer the parameters of the model and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to determine the number of mixture components.\nA Bayesian version of the mixture model [93] analyzes the model with respect to time but does not capture the effect of covariates. On the other hand the work by [94] performs variable selection based on the covariates but ignores the clustering aspect of the modeling. Similarly, [95] defines an infinite mixture model but does not include a mixture of experts, hence implicitly assuming that all the covariates are generated by the same distribution with a common shape parameter for the Weibull distribution.\n[87] unify the various important elements of this analysis into a Bayesian mixture-of-experts (MOE) framework to model survival time, while capturing the effect of covariates and also dealing with an unknown number of mixing components. To infer the number of experts a Dirichlet process prior on the mixing proportions is applied, which solves the issue of determining the number of mixture components beforehand [96]. Due to the lack of fixed-length sufficient statistics, the Weibull distribution is not part of the exponential family of distributions and hence the regression component, introduced via the proportionality hazards model, is non-standard. Furthermore, the framework of [87] includes sparsity constraints to the regression coefficients in order to determine the key explanatory factors (biomarkers) for each mixture component. Sparseness is achieved by utilizing a Bayesian version of the Group-Lasso [97, 98] which is a sparse constraint for grouped coefficients [99]."

The Peta bytes of histological data which will be available in the near future pose also a number of software engineering challenges, including distributed processing of whole slides and TMAs in clusters or the cloud, multiprocessor and multicore implementations of analysis algorithms and facilitating real time image processing on GPUs."

Avatar based visualization proved to be useful not only for medical experts but also for a new generation of patients who are better informed and demand online updated and appropriately visualized informations about their own disease state and treatment procedures.\nFurthermore this approach can be extended for decision support by statistical models which are able to utilize this unified view of patients incorporating data from a large variety of clinical sources, e.g. pathology, cytology, radiology, etc."

      "text" : "Real-time, in vivo cancer detection on cellular level appears as a futuristic dream in patient care but could be a reality in a few years. [104] constructed a fiber-optic fluorescence microscope using a consumer-grade camera for in vivo cellular imaging. The fiber-optic fluorescence microscope includes an LED light, an objective lens, a fiber-optic bundle, and a consumer-grade DSLR. The system was used to image an oral cancer cell line, a human tissue specimen and the oral mucosa of a healthy human subject in vivo, following topical application of 0.01% proflavine. The fiber-optic microscope resolved individual nuclei in all specimens and tissues imaged. This capability allowed qualitative and quantitative differences between normal and precancerous or cancerous\ntissues to be identified. In combination with a computational pathology framework, this technique would allow the real time classification of cancerous cells in epithelial tissues. Such a portable and inexpensive system is especially interesting for patient care in low-resource settings like the developing world.\nConstructing a microscope for mobile phones defines the future of patient care in remote sites with centralized analysis support. [105] built a mobile phone-mounted light microscope and demonstrated its potential for clinical use by imaging sickle and P. falciparum-infected red blood cells in brightfield and M. tuberculosis-infected sputum samples in fluorescence with LED excitation. In all cases the resolution exceeded the critical level that is necessary to detect blood cell and microorganism morphology. This concept could provide an interesting tool for disease diagnosis and screening, especially in the developing world and rural areas where laboratory facilities are scarce but mobile phone infrastructure is available."

      "heading" : "6.4. Standards and Exchange Formats",
      "text" : "One of the major obstacles for wide spread use of computational pathology is the absence of generally agreed upon standards and exchange formats. This deficit not only handicaps slide processing management and whole slide digital imaging [106], but it also extends to statistical models and analysis software. Standardized exchange formats would support project specific combinations of object detectors, staining estimation algorithms and medical statistics. It would be very much desirable if at least the research community would agree on a few simple interfaces for data and model exchange."
