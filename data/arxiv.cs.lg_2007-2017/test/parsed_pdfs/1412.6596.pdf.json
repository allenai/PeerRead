      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Currently the predominant systems for visual object recognition and detection (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler & Fergus, 2013; Girshick et al., 2013; Sermanet et al., 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014) use purely supervised training with regularization such as dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) to avoid overfitting. These systems do not account for missing labels, subjective labeling or inexhaustivelyannotated images. However, this assumption often does not hold, especially for very large datasets and in high-resolution images with complex scenes. For example, in recognition, the class labels may be missing; in detection, the objects in the image may not all be localized; in subjective tasks such as facial emotion recognition, humans may not even agree on the class label. As training sets for deep networks become larger (as they should), the problem of missing and noisy labels becomes more acute, and so we argue it is a fundamental problem for scaling up vision.\nIn this work we propose a simple approach to hande noisy and incomplete labeling in weaklysupervised deep learning, by augmenting the usual prediction objective with a notion of perceptual consistency. We consider a prediction consistent if the same prediction is made given similar percepts, where the notion of similarity incorporates features learned by the deep network.\nOne interpretation of the perceptual consistency objective is that the learner makes use of its representation of the world (implicit in the network parameters) to match incoming percepts to known\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n65 96\nv3 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n1 5\nA pr\ncategories, or in general structured outputs. This provides the learner justification to “disagree” with a perceptually-inconsistent training label, and effectively re-label the data while training. More accurate labels may lead to a better model, which allows further label clean-up, and the learner bootstraps itself in this way. Of course, too much skepticism of the labels carries the risk of ending up with a delusional agent, so it is important to balance the trade-off between prediction and the learner’s perceptual consistency.\nIn our experiments we demonstrate that our approach yields substantial robustness to several types of label noise on several datasets. On MNIST handwritten digits (LeCun & Cortes, 1998) we show that our model is robust to label corruption. On the Toronto Face Database (Susskind et al., 2010) we show that our model handles well the case of subjective labels in emotion recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results, and can also benefit from unlabeled face images with no modification to our method. On the ILSVRC2014 detection challenge data (Russakovsky et al., 2014), we show that our approach improves single-shot person detection using a MultiBox network (Erhan et al., 2014), and also improves performance in full 200-way detection using MultiBox for region proposal and a deep CNN for post-classification.\nIn section 2 we discuss related work, in section 3 we describe our method along with a probabilistic interpretation and in section 4 we present our results."

      "heading" : "2 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "The literature on semi-supervised and weakly-supervised learning is vast (see Zhu (2005) for a survey), and so in this section we focus on the key previous papers that inspired this work and on other papers on weakly- and semi-supervised deep learning.\nThe notion of bootstrapping, or “self-training” a learning agent was proposed in (Yarowsky, 1995) as a way to do word-sense disambiguation with only unlabeled examples and a small list of seed example sentences with labels. The algorithm proceeds by building an initial classifier using the seed examples, and then iteratively classifying unlabeled examples, extracting new seed rules for the classifier using the now expanded training data, and repeating these steps until convergence. The algorithm was analyzed by Abney (Abney, 2004) and more recently by (Haffari & Sarkar, 2012).\nCo-training (Blum & Mitchell, 1998; Nigam et al., 2000; Nigam & Ghani, 2000) was similarlymotivated but used a pair of classifiers with separate views of the data to iteratively learn and generate additional training labels. Whitney & Sarkar (2012) proposed bootstrapping labeled training examples with graph-based label propagation. Brodley & Friedl (1999) developed statistical methods for identifying mislabeled training data.\nRosenberg et al. (2005) also trained an object detection system in a weakly-supervised manner using self-training, and demonstrated that their proposed model achieved comparable performance to models trained with a much larger set of labels. However, that approach works as a wrapper around an existing detection system, whereas in this work we integrate a consistency objective for bootstrapping into the training of the deep network itself.\nOur work shares a similar motivation to these earlier works, but instead of explicitly generating new training labels and adding new examples to the training set in an outer loop, we incorporate our consistency objective directly into the model. In addition, we consider not only the case of learning from unlabeled examples, but also from noisy labels and inexhaustively-annotated examples.\nMnih & Hinton (2012) developed deep neural networks for improved labeling of aerial images, with robust loss functions to handle label omission and registration errors. This work shares a similar motivation of robustness to noisy labels, but rather than formulating loss functions for specific types of noise, we add a generic consistency objective to the loss to achieve robustness.\nMinimum entropy regularization, proposed in (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2005; 2006), performs semisupervised learning by augmenting cross-entropy loss with a term encouraging the classifier to make predictions with high confidence on the unlabeled examples1. This is notable because in their approach training on unlabeled examples does not require a generative model, which is beneficial for training on high-resolution images and other sensory data. We take a similar approach by side-\n1see eq. 9.7 in (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2006)\nstepping the difficulty of fully-generative models of high-dimensional sensory data. However, we extend beyond shallow models to deep networks, and to structured output prediction.\nNever ending language learning (NELL) (Carlson et al., 2010) and never ending image learning (NEIL) (Chen et al., 2013; 2014) are lifelong-learning systems for language and image understanding, respectively. They continuously bootstrap themselves using a cycle of data collection, propagation of labels to the newly collected data, and self-improvement by training on the new data. Our work is complementary to these efforts, and focuses on building robustness to noisy and missing labels into the model for weakly-supervised deep learning.\nLarochelle & Bengio (2008) developed an RBM for classification that uses a hybrid generative and discriminative training objective. Deep Boltmann Machines (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) can also be trained in a semi-supervised manner with labels connected to the top layer. More recently, multi-prediction DBM training (Goodfellow et al., 2013) and Generative Stochastic Networks (Bengio & Thibodeau-Laufer, 2013) improved the performance and simplified the training of deep generative models, enabling training via backpropagation much like in standard deep supervised networks. However, fully-generative unsupervised training on high-dimensional sensory data, e.g. ImageNet images, is still far behind supervised methods in terms of performance, and so in this work we do not follow the generative approach directly. Instead, this work focuses on a way to benefit from unlabeled and weakly-labeled examples with minimal modification to existing deep supervised networks. We demonstrate increased robustness to label noise and performance improvements from unlabeled data for a minimal engineering effort.\nMore recently, the problem of deep learning from noisy labels has begun to receive attention. Lee (2013) also followed the idea of minimum entropy regularization, and proposed generating “pseudolabels” as training targets for unlabeled data, and showed improved performance on MNIST with few labeled examples. Sukhbaatar & Fergus (2014) developed two deep learning techniques for handling noisy labels, learning to model the noise distribution in a top-down and bottom-up fashion. In this work, we push further by extending beyond class labels to structured outputs, and we achieve state-of-the-art scalable detection performance on ILSVRC2014, despite the fact that our method does not require explicitly modeling the noise distribution."

      "heading" : "3 METHOD",
      "text" : "In this section we describe two approaches: section 3.1 uses reconstruction error as a consistency objective and explicitly models the noise distribution as a matrix mapping model predictions to training labels. A reconstruction loss is added to promote top-down consistency of model predictions with the observations, which allows the model to discover the pattern of noise in the data.\nThe method presented in section 3.2 (bootstrapping) uses a convex combination of training labels and the current model’s predictions to generate the training targets, and thereby avoids directly modeling the noise distribution. This property is well-suited to the case of structured outputs, for which modeling dense interactions among all pairs of output units may be neither practical nor useful. These two approaches are compared empirically in section 4.\nIn section 3.3 we show how to apply our bootstrapping approach to structured outputs by using the MultiBox (Erhan et al., 2014) region proposal network to handle the case of inexhaustive structured output labeling for single-shot person detection and for class-agnostic region proposal."

      "text" : "Let x ∈ {0, 1}D be the data (or deep features computed from the data) and t ∈ {0, 1}L, ∑\nk tk = 1 the observed noisy multinomial labels. The standard softmax regresses x onto t without taking into account noisy or missing labels. In addition to optimizing the conditional log-likelihood logP (t|x), we add a regularization term encouraging the class prediction to be perceptually consistent.\nWe first introduce into our model the “true” class label (as opposed to the noisy label observations) as a latent multinomial variable q ∈ {0, 1}L, ∑ j qj = 1. Our deep feed-forward network models\nthe posterior over q using the usual softmax regression:\nP (qj = 1|x) = P̃ (qj = 1|x)∑L\nj′=1 P̃ (qj′ = 1|x) =\nexp( ∑D\ni=1W (1) ij xi + b (1) i )∑L j′=1 exp( ∑D i=1W (1) ij′ xi + b (1) i )\n(1)\nwhere P̃ denotes the unnormalized probability distribution. Given the true label q, the label noise can be modeled using another softmax with logits as follows:\nlog P̃ (tk = 1|q) = L∑\nj=1\nW (2) kj qj + b (2) k (2)\nRoughly, W (2)kj learns the log-probability of observing true label j as noisy label k. Given only an observation x, we can marginalize over q to compute the posterior of target t given x.\nP (tk = 1|x) = L∑\nj=1\nP (tk = 1, qj = 1|x) = L∑\nj=1\nP (tk = 1|qj = 1)P (qj = 1|x) (3)\nwhere the label noise distribution and posterior over true labels are defined above. We can perform discriminative training by gradient ascent on logP (t|x). However, this purely discriminative training does not yet incorporate perceptual consistency, and there is no explicit incentive for the model to treat q as the “true” label; it can be viewed as another hidden layer, with the multinomial constraint resulting in an information bottleneck.\nIn unpublished work2, Hinton & Mnih (2009) developed a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Smolensky, 1986) variant with hidden multinomial output unit q and observed noisy label unit t as described above. The associated energy function can be written as\nE(x, t,q) = − D∑ i=1 L∑ j=1 W (1) ij xiqj − L∑ k=1 L∑ j=1 W (2) kj tkqj − L∑ j=1 b (1) j qj − L∑ k=1 b (2) k tk − D∑ i=1 b (3) i xi (4)\nDue to the bipartite structure of the RBM, t and x are conditionally independent given q, and so the energy function in eq. (4) leads to a similar form of the posterior as in eq. (3), marginalizing out the hidden multinomial unit. The probability distribution arising from (4) is given by\nP (x, t) =\n∑ q exp(−E(x, t,q))\nZ where Z = ∑\nx,t,q exp(−E(x, t,q)) is the partition function. The model can be trained with a generative objective, e.g. by approximate gradient ascent on logP (x, t) via contrastive divergence (Hinton, 2002). Generative training naturally provides a notion of consistency between observations x and predictions q because the model learns to draw sample observations via the conditional likelihood P (xi = 1|q) = σ( ∑L j=1W (1) ij qj + b (3) i ), assuming binary observations.\n2Known from personal correspondence.\nHowever, fully-generative training is complicated by the fact that the exact likelihood gradient is intractable due to computing the partition function Z, and in practice MCMC is used. Generative training is further complicated (though certainly still possible) in cases where the features x are nonbinary. To avoid these complications, and to make our approach rapidly applicable to existing deep networks using rectified linear activations, and trainable via exact gradient descent, we propose an analogous autoencoder version.\nFigure 1 compares the RBM and autoencoder approaches to the multiclass prediction problem with perceptual consistency. The overall objective in the feed-forward version is as follows:\nLrecon(x, t) = − L∑\nk=1\ntk logP (tk = 1|x) + β||x−W (2)q(x)||22 (5)\nwhere q(x)j = P (qj = 1|x) as in equation 1. The parameter β can be found via cross-validation. Experimental results using this method are presented in sections 4.1 and 4.2."

      "heading" : "3.2 CONSISTENCY IN MULTI-CLASS PREDICTION VIA BOOTSTRAPPING",
      "text" : "In this section we develop a simple consistency objective that does not require an explicit noise distribution or a reconstruction term. The idea is to dynamically update the targets of the prediction objective based on the current state of the model. The resulting targets are a convex combination of (1) the noisy training label, and (2) the current prediction of the model. Intuitively, as the learner improves over time, its predictions can be trusted more. This mitigates the damage of incorrect labeling, because incorrect labels are likely to be eventually highly inconsistent with other stimuli predicted to have the same label by the model.\nBy paying less heed to inconsistent labels, the learner can develop a more coherent model, which further improves its ability to evaluate the consistency of noisy labels. We refer to this approach as “bootstrapping”, in the sense of pulling oneself up by one’s own bootstraps, and also due to inspiration from the work of Yarowsky (1995) which is also referred to as bootstrapping.\nConcretely, we use a cross-entropy objective as before, but generate new regression targets for each SGD mini-batch based on the current state of the model. We empirically evaluated two types of bootstrapping. “Soft” bootstrapping uses predicted class probabilities q directly to generate regression targets for each batch as follows:\nLsoft(q, t) = L∑\nk=1\n[βtk + (1− β)qk] log(qk) (6)\nIn fact, it can be shown that the resulting objective is equivalent to softmax regression with minimum entropy regularization, which was previously studied in (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2006). Intuitively, minimum entropy regularization encourages the model to have a high confidence in predicting labels (even for the unlabeled examples, which enables semi-supervised learning).\n“Hard” bootstrapping modifies regression targets using the MAP estimate of q given x, which we denote as zk := 1[k = argmax qi, i = 1...L]:\nLhard(q, t) = L∑\nk=1\n[βtk + (1− β)zk] log(qk) (7)\nWhen used with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, this leads to an EM-like algorithm: In the E-step, estimate the “true” confidence targets as a convex combination of training labels and model predictions; in the M-step, update the model parameters to better predict those generated targets.\nBoth hard and soft bootstrapping can be viewed as instances of a more general approach in which model-generated regression targets are modulated by a softmax temperature parameter T ; i.e.\nP (qj = 1|x) = exp(T · (\n∑D i=1W (1) ij xi + b\n(1) j ))∑L j′=1 exp(T · ( ∑D i=1W (1) ij′ xi + b (1) j′ ))\n(8)\nSetting T = 1 recovers soft boostrapping, and T = ∞ recovers hard bootstrapping. We only use these two operating points in our experiments, but it may be worthwhile to explore other values for T , and learning T for each dataset."

      "text" : "Noisy labels also occur in structured output prediction problems such as object detection. Current state-of-the-art object detection systems train on images annotated with bounding box labels of the relevant objects in each image, and the class label for each box. However, it is expensive to exhaustively annotate each image, and for some commonly-appearing categories the data may be prone to missing annotations. In this section, we modify the training objective of the MultiBox (Erhan et al., 2014) network for object detection to incorporate a notion of perceptual consistency into the loss.\nIn the MultiBox approach, ground-truth bounding boxes are clustered and the resulting centroids are used as “priors” for predicting object location. A deep neural network is trained to predict, for each groundtruth object in an image, a residual of that groundtruth bounding box to the best-matching bounding box prior. The network also outputs a logistic confidence score for each prior, indicating the model’s belief of whether or not an object appears in the corresponding location. Because MultiBox gives proposals with confidence scores, it enables very efficient runtime-quality tradeoffs for detection via thresholding the top-scoring proposals within budget. Thus it is an attractive target for further quality improvements, as we pursue in this section.\nDenote the confidence score training targets as t ∈ {0, 1}L and the predicted confidence scores as c ∈ [0, 1]L. The objective for MultiBox 3 can be written as the following cross-entropy loss:\nLmultibox(c, t) = − L∑\nk=1\n(tk log(ck) + (1− tk) log(1− ck)) (9)\nNote that the sum here is over object locations, not class labels as in the case of sections 3.1 and 3.2.\nIf there is an object at location k, but tk = 0 due to inexhaustive annotation, the model pays a large cost for correctly predicting ck = 1. Training naively on the noisy labels leads to perverse learning situations such as the following: two objects of the same category (potentially within the same image) appear in the training data, but only one of them is labeled. To reduce the loss, the confidence prediction layer must learn to distinguish the two objects, which is exactly contrary to the objective of visual invariance to category-preserving differences.\nTo incorporate a notion of perceptual consistency into the loss, we follow the same approach as in the case of multi-class classification: augment the regression targets using the model’s current state. In the “hard” case, MAP estimates can be obtained by thresholding ck > 1/2.\nLmultibox−hard(c, t) =− L∑\nk=1\n[βtk + (1− β)1ck>0.5] log(ck) (10)\n− L∑\nk=1\n[β(1− tk) + (1− β)(1− 1ck>0.5)] log(1− ck)\nLmultibox−soft(c, t) =− L∑\nk=1\n[βtk + (1− β)ck] log(ck) (11)\n− L∑\nk=1\n[β(1− tk) + (1− β)(1− ck)] log(1− ck)\nWith the bootstrap variants of the MultiBox objective, unlabeled positives pose less of a problem because penalties for large ck are down-scaled by factor β in the first term and (1−ck) in the second term. By mitigating penalties due to missing positives in the data, our approach allows the model to learn to predict ck with high confidence even if the objects at location k are often unlabeled."

Specifically, we used a fixed random permutation of the labels as visualized in figure 2, and we perform control experiments while varying the probability of applying the label permutation to each training example.\nAll models were trained with mini-batch SGD, with the same architecture: 784-500-300-10 neural network with rectified linear units. We used L2 weight decay of 0.0001. We found that β = 0.8 worked best for bootstrap-hard, 0.95 for bootstrap-soft, and 0.005 for bootstrap-recon. We initialize W (2) to the identity matrix.\nFor the network trained with our proposed consistency objective, we initialized the network layers from the baseline prediction-only model. It is also possible to initialize from scratch using our approach, but we found that with pre-training we could use a larger β and more quickly converge to a good result. Intuitively, this is similar to the initial collection of “seed” rules in the original bootstrapping algorithm of (Yarowsky, 1995). During the fine-tuning training phase, all network weights are updated by backpropagating gradients through the layers.\nFigure 2 shows that our bootstrapping method provides a very significant benefit in the case of permuted labels. The bootstrap-recon method performs the best, and bootstrap-hard nearly as well. The bootstrap-soft method provides some benefit in the high-noise regime, but only slightly better than the baseline overall.\nFigure 2 also shows that bootstrap-recon effectively learns the noise distribution P (t|q) via the parameters W (2)kj . Intuitively, the loss from the reconstruction term provides the learner a basis on which predictions q may disagree with training labels t. Since x must be able to be reconstructed from q in bootstrap-recon, learning a non-identity W (2) allows q to flexibly vary from t to better reconstruct x without incurring a penalty from prediction error.\nHowever, it is interesting to note that bootstrap-hard achieves nearly equivalent performance without explicitly parameterizing the noise distribution. This is useful because reconstruction may be challenging in many cases, such as when x is drawn from a complicated, high-dimensional distribution, and bootstrap-hard is trivial to implement on top of existing deep supervised networks."

      "text" : "In this paper we developed novel training methods for weakly-supervised deep learning, and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on multi-class prediction and structured output prediction for several datasets. Our method is exceedingly simple and can be applied with very little engineering effort to existing networks trained using a purely-supervised objective. The improvements that we show even with very simple methods, suggest that moving beyond purely-supervised deep learning is worthy of further research attention. In addition to achieving better performance with the data we already have, our results suggest that performance gains may be achieved from collecting more data at a cheaper price, since image annotation need not be as exhasutive and mistaken labels are not as harmful to the performance.\nIn future work, it may be promising to consider learning a time-dependent policy for tuning β, the scaling factor between prediction and perceptual consistency objectives, and also to extend our approach to the case of a situated agent. Another promising direction is to augment large-scale training for detection (e.g. ILSVRC) with unlabeled and more weakly-labeled images, to further benefit from our proposed perceptual consistency objective.\n4In a previous version of this draft we included numbers on the full validation set.

In addition, we consider not only the case of learning from unlabeled examples, but also from noisy labels and inexhaustively-annotated examples.

However, fully-generative unsupervised training on high-dimensional sensory data, e.g. ImageNet images, is still far behind supervised methods in terms of performance, and so in this work we do not follow the generative approach directly. Instead, this work focuses on a way to benefit from unlabeled and weakly-labeled examples with minimal modification to existing deep supervised networks. We demonstrate increased robustness to label noise and performance improvements from unlabeled data for a minimal engineering effort. More recently, the problem of deep learning from noisy labels has begun to receive attention. Lee (2013) also followed the idea of minimum entropy regularization, and proposed generating “pseudolabels” as training targets for unlabeled data, and showed improved performance on MNIST with few labeled examples.",

They continuously bootstrap themselves using a cycle of data collection, propagation of labels to the newly collected data, and self-improvement by training on the new data. Our work is complementary to these efforts, and focuses on building robustness to noisy and missing labels into the model for weakly-supervised deep learning.

    "abstractText" : "Current state-of-the-art deep learning systems for visual object recognition and detection use purely supervised training with regularization such as dropout to avoid overfitting. The performance depends critically on the amount of labeled examples, and in current practice the labels are assumed to be unambiguous and accurate. However, this assumption often does not hold; e.g. in recognition, class labels may be missing; in detection, objects in the image may not be localized; and in general, the labeling may be subjective. In this work we propose a generic way to handle noisy and incomplete labeling by augmenting the prediction objective with a notion of consistency. We consider a prediction consistent if the same prediction is made given similar percepts, where the notion of similarity is between deep network features computed from the input data. In experiments we demonstrate that our approach yields substantial robustness to label noise on several datasets. On MNIST handwritten digits, we show that our model is robust to label corruption. On the Toronto Face Database, we show that our model handles well the case of subjective labels in emotion recognition, achieving state-of-theart results, and can also benefit from unlabeled face images with no modification to our method. On the ILSVRC2014 detection challenge data, we show that our approach extends to very deep networks, high resolution images and structured outputs, and results in improved scalable detection.",
