      "text" : "Training deep neural networks has long been computational demanding and time consuming. For some state-of-the-art architectures, it can take weeks to get models trained [Krizhevsky et al., 2012]. Another problem is that the demand for memory can be huge. For example, many commmon models in speech recognition or machine translation need 12 Gigabytes or more of storage [Gulcehre et al., 2015]. To deal with these issues it is common to train deep neural networks by resorting to GPU or CPU clusters and to well designed parallelization strategies [Le, 2013].\nMost of the computation performed in training a neural network are floating point multiplications. In this paper, we focus on eliminating most of these multiplications to reduce computation. Based on our previous work [Courbariaux et al., 2015], which eliminates multiplications in computing hidden representations by binarizing weights, our method deals with both hidden state computations and backward weight updates. Our approach has 2 components. In the forward pass, weights are stochastically binarized using an approach we call binary connect or ternary connect, and for backpropagation of errors, we propose a new approach which we call quantized back propagation that converts multiplications into bit-shifts."

      "text" : "Several approaches have been proposed in the past to simplify computations in neural networks. Some of them try to restrict weight values to be an integer power of two, thus to reduce all the multiplications to be binary shifts [Kwan and Tang, 1993] [Marchesi et al., 1993]. In this way, multipli-\nar X\niv :1\n51 0.\n03 00\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n1 O\ncations are eliminated in both training and testing time. The disadvantage is that model performance can be severely reduced, and convergence of training can no longer be guaranteed.\nAnother approach, [Kim and Paris, 2015], introduces a completely Boolean network, which simplifies the test time computation at an acceptable performance hit. The approach still requires a real-valued, full resolution training phase, however, so the benefits of reducing computations does not apply to training. Similarly, [Machado et al., 2015] manage to get acceptable accuracy on sparse representation classification by replacing all floating-point multiplications by integer shifts. Bitstream networks [Burge et al., 1999] also provides a way of binarizing neural network connections, by substituting weight connections with logical gates.\nThere are some other techniques, which focus on reducing the training complexity. For instance, instead of reducing the resolution of weights, [Simard and Graf, 1994] quantizes states, learning rates, and gradients to powers of two. This approach manages to eliminate multiplications with negligible performance reduction."

      "text" : "In [Courbariaux et al., 2015], we introduced a weight binarization technique which removes multiplications in the forward pass. We summarize this approach in this subsection, and introduce an extenion to it in the next.\nConsider a neural network layer with N input and M output units. The forward computation is y = h(Wx + b) where W and b are weights and biases, respectively, h is the activation function, and x and y are the layer’s inputs and outputs. If we choose ReLU as h, there will be no multiplications in computing the activation function, thus all multiplications reside in the matrix product Wx. For each input vector x, NM floating point multiplications are needed.\nBinary connect eliminates these multiplications by stochastically sampling weights to be −1 or 1. Full resolution weights w̄ are kept in memory as reference, and each time when y is needed, we sample a stochastic weight matrix W according to w̄. For each element of the sampled matrix W , the probability of getting a 1 is proportional to how ”close” its corresponding entry in w̄ is to 1. i.e.,\nP (Wij = 1) = w̄ij + 1\n2 ; P (Wij = −1) = 1 − P (Wij = 1) (1)\nIt is necessary to add some edge constraints to w̄. To ensure that P (Wij = 1) lies in a reasonable range, values in w̄ are forced to be a real value in the interval [-1, 1]. If during the updates any of its value grows beyond that interval, we set it to be its corresponding edge values −1 or 1. That way floating point multiplications become sign changes.\nA remaining question concerns the use of multiplications in the random number generator involved in the sampling process. Sampling an integer has to be faster than multiplication for the algorithm to be worth it. Fortunately, efficiently generating random numbers has been studied in [Jeavons et al., 1994] [van Daalen et al., 1993]. Also, it is possible to get random numbers according to real random processes, like CPU temperatures, etc. We are not going into the details of random number generation as this is not the focus of this paper."

      "heading" : "3.2 Ternary connect",
      "text" : "The binary connect introduced in the former subsection allows weights to be −1 or 1. However, in a trained neural network, it is common to observe that many learned weights are zero or close to zero. Although the stochastic sampling process would allow the mean value of sampled weights to be zero, this suggests that it may be beneficial to explicitly allow weights to be zero.\nTo allow weights to be zero, some adjustments are needed for Eq. 1. We split the interval of [-1, 1], within which the full resolution weight value w̄ij lies, into two sub-intervals: [−1, 0] and (0, 1]. If a weight value w̄ij drops into one of them, we sample w̄ij to be the two edge values of that interval, according to their distance from w̄ij , i.e., if w̄ij > 0:\nP (Wij = 1) = w̄ij ; P (Wij = 0) = 1 − w̄ij (2)\nand if w̄ij <= 0:\nP (Wij = −1) = −w̄ij ; P (Wij = 0) = 1 + w̄ij (3)\nLike binary connect, ternary connect also eliminates all multiplications in the forward pass."

      "heading" : "4 Quantized back propagation",
      "text" : "In the former section we described how multiplications can be eliminated from the forward pass. In this section, we propose a way to eliminate multiplications from the backward pass.\nSuppose the i-th layer of the network has N input and M output units, and consider an error signal δ propagating downward from its output. The updates for weights and biases would be the outer product of the layer’s input and the error signal:\n∆W = ηδ ◦ h ′ (Wx + b)xT (4)\n∆b = ηδ ◦ h ′ (Wx + b) (5)\nwhere η is the learning rate, and x the input to the layer. While propagating through the layers, the error signal δ needs to be updated, too. Its update taking into account the next layer below takes the form:\nδ = WT δ ◦ h ′ (Wx + b) (6)\nThere are 3 terms that appear repeatedly in Eqs. 4 to 6: δ, h ′ (Wx + b) and x. The latter two terms introduce matrix outer products. To eliminate multiplications, we can quantize one of them to be an integer power of 2, so that multiplications involving that term become binary shifts. The expression h ′ (Wx + b) contains downflowing gradients, which are largely determined by the cost function and network parameters, thus it is hard to bound its values. However, bounding the values is essential for quantization because we need to supply a fixed number of bits for each sampled value, and if that value varies too much, we will need too many bits for the exponent. This, in turn, will result in the need for more bits to store the sampled value and unnecessarily increase the required amount of computation.\nWhile h ′ (Wx + b) is not a good choice for quantization, x is a better choice, because it is the hidden representation at each layer, and we know roughly the distribution of each layer’s activation.\nOur approach is therefore to eliminate multiplications in Eq. 4 by quantizing each entry in x to an integer power of 2. That way the outer product in Eq. 4 becomes a series of bit shifts. Experimentally, we find that allowing a maximum of 3 to 4 bits of shift is sufficient to make the network work well. This means that 3 bits are already enough to quantize x. As the float32 format has 24 bits of mantissa, shifting (to the left or right) by 3 to 4 bits is completely tolerable. We refer to this approach of back propagation as ”quantized back propagation.”\nIf we choose ReLU as the activation function and use binary (ternary) connect to sampleW , computing the term h ′ (Wx + b) involves no multiplications at all. In addition, quantized back propagation eliminates the multiplications in the outer product in Eq. 4. The only place where multiplications remain is the element-wise product. From Eqs. 4 to 6, we can see that 6 ×M multiplications are needed for all computations.\nLike in the forward pass, most of the multiplications are used in the weight updates. Compared with standard back propagation, which would need 2MN + 6M multiplications, the amount of multiplications left is negligible in quantized back propagation. Our experiments in Section 5 show that this way of dramatically decreasing multiplications does not necessarily entail a loss in performance."

All models are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) without momentum. We use batch normalization for all the models to accelerate learning. At training time, binary (ternary) connect and quantized back propagation are used, while at test time, we use the learned full resolution weights for the forward propagation. For each dataset, all hyper-parameters are set to the same values for the different methods, except that the learning rate is adapted independently for each one."

At the last layer we use the hinge loss as the cost. The training set is separated into two parts, one of which is the training set with 40000 images and the other the validation set with 10000 images. Our experimental results show that despite removing most multiplications, our approach yields a comparable (in fact, even slightly higher) performance than full resolution training. The performance improvement is likely due to the regularization effect implied by the stochastic sampling."

The network has 6 convolution/pooling layers, 1 fully connected layer and 1 classification layer. We use the hinge loss for training.

The figure shows that binarization makes the network converge slower than ordinary SGD, but yields a better optimum after the algorithm converges. Compared with binary connect (red line), adding quantization in the error propagation (yellow line) doesn’t hurt the model accuracy at all. Moreover, having ternary connect combined with quantized back propagation (green line) surpasses all the other three approaches."

      "heading" : "5.3 The effect of bit clipping",
      "text" : "In Section 4 we mentioned that quantization will be limited by the number of bits we use. The maximum number of bits to shift determines the amount of memory needed, but it also determines in what range a single weight update can vary. Figure 2 shows the model performance as a function\nof the maximum allowed bit shifts. These experiments are conducted on the MNIST dataset, with the aforementioned fully connected model. For each case of bit clipping, we repeat the experiment for 10 times with different initial random instantiations.\nThe figure shows that the approach is not very sensible to the number of bits used. The maximum allowed shift in the figure varies from 2 bits to 10 bits, and the performance remains roughly the same. Even by restricting bit shifts to 2, the model can still learn successfully. The fact that the performance is not very sensitive to the maximum of allowed bit shifts suggests that we do not need to redefine the number of bits used for quantizing x for different tasks, which would be an important practical advantage.\nThe x to be quantized is not necessarily distributed symmetrically around 2. For example, Figure 3 shows the distribution of x at each layer in the middle of training. The maximum amount of shift to the left does not need to be the same as that on the right. A more efficient way is to use different values for the maximum left shift and the maximum right shift. Bearing that in mind, we set it to 3 bits maximum to the right and 4 bits to the left."

This could make it possible to dramatically accelerate the training of neural networks by using dedicated hardware implementations. A somewhat surprising fact is that instead of damaging prediction accuracy the approach tends improve it, which is probably due to the regularization effect it entails. Directions for future work include exploring actual implementations of this approach (for example, using FPGA), seeking more efficient ways of binarization, and the extension to recurrent neural networks."
