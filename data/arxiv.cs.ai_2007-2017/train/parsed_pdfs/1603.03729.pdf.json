      "text" : "The neutrosophic representation of information was proposed by Florentin Smarandache [6], [13-19] and it is a generalisation of intuitionistic fuzzy representation proposed by Krassimir Atanassov [1-4] and also for fuzzy representation proposed by Lotfi Zadeh [20]. The neutrosophic representation is described by three parameters: degree of truth μ, degree of indeterminacy ω and degree of falsity ν. In this paper we assume that the parameters . The representation space ( is a primary space for neutrosophic information. Starting from primary space, it can be derived other more nuanced representations belonging to multi-valued fuzzy spaces where the set of parameters defines fuzzy partitions of unity. In these multi-valued fuzzy spaces, at most four parameters of representation are different from zero while all the others are zero [7], [8], [9], [10]. In the following, the paper has the structure: Section 2 presents the construction of two multi-valued representation for bipolar information. The first is based on Belnap logical values, namely true, false, unknown and contradictory while the second is based on a new logic that was obtained by adding to the Belnap logic the fifth value: ambiguity; Section 3 presents two variants for penta valued representation of neutrosophic information based on truth, falsity, ignorance, contradiction and hesitancy; Section 4 presents a penta valued logic that uses the following values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and hesitant; Section 5 presents five operators for the penta valued structures constructed in section 3. Firstly, it\nwas defined two binary operators namely union and intersection, and secondly, three unary operators, namely complement, negation and dual. All these five operators where defined in concordance with the logic presented in the section 4; Section 6 extend the penta valued structures presented in section 3 by filtering from truth and falsity the sixth feature, namely the ambiguity; The last section outlines some conclusions."

      "text" : "The bipolar information is defined by the degree of truth and the degree of falsity . Also, it is associated with a degree of certainty and a degree of uncertainty. The bipolar uncertainty can have three features well outlined: ambiguity, ignorance and contradiction. All these three features have implicit values that can be calculated using the bipolar pair . In the same time, ambiguity, ignorance and contradiction can be considered features belonging to indeterminacy but to an implicit indeterminacy. We can compute the values of these implicit features of indeterminacy. First we calculate the index of ignorance and index of contradiction :\n(2.1)\n(2.2)\nThere is the following equality:\nwhich turns into the next tetra valued partition of unity:\n(2.4)\nThe four terms form (2.4) are related to the four logical values of Belnap logic: true, false, unknown and contradictory [5]. Further, we extract from the first two terms the bipolar ambiguity :\nMoreover, on this way, we get the two components of bipolar certainty: index of truth\nand index of falsity :\nSo, we obtained a penta valued representation of bipolar information by . The vector components verify the partition of unity condition, namely:\n(2.8)\nFormula (2.8) suggests the bipolar information structure shown in figure 1.\nIn the following sections, the two representations defined by (2.4) and (2.8) will be used to represent the neutrosophic information in two penta valued structuresh."

Also, it was constructed an associated penta valued logic and then using this logic, it was defined for the proposed penta valued structure the following operators: union, intersection, negation, complement and dual. Then, the penta valued representation is extended to a hexa valued one, adding the sixth component, namely the index of ambiguity.",
