      "text" : "Let us begin please by considering the set S of all functions of the form f : X → Y and g : X,Y → Z where each X, Y , and Z are single bits from the set {0,1}. Then we have the set of functions as depicted in Tables 1 and 2 which we may call the George Boole Logical Operators, where all such operators of the form ⊖x, or x ⊛ y may be interpreted as functions, e.g. ⊖(x), or ⊛(x, y), and vice-versa. When given the variable X, or the tuple (X,Y ), which we may call Boolean variables, we may list each of their possible values, and then in the columns define each possible function that may exist.\nFrom these tables we select the functions f3, g2, g8, and g10 which satisfy the definitions of the Boolean NOT, AND, OR, and XNOR operators from [6], and so they are depicted in Table 3.\nFrom these tables we can also observe that each function in Sf can be written in terms of a function in Sg as shown by Table 4, allowing that only those functions in Sg be further utilized by this paper 1.\nThen the set Sg may be used instead of the set Sf and we select Theorem 1.1 to utilize XNOR(x, 0) instead of NOT (x), to thereby use AND, OR, and XNOR further in the paper. We show that XNOR is binary equivalent to NOT in the proof of Theorem 1.1.\nTheorem 1.1 NOT(x) = XNOR(x,0)\nProof: Given x, then f3(x) = g10(x, 0) with:\n1. NOT(0) = XNOR(0,0) = 1\n2. NOT(1) = XNOR(1,0) = 0\nThen we can show that the extra parameter on XNOR embodies a previously constant value in the definition of logic table from [3]. We accomplish that through an analysis of world values, logic values, logic questions, logic tables and their expansion to a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) equation which computes the result designed by the logic table using the methods from [5] and [7].\nDuring that analysis a series of examples are shown using conventional methods on discrete Boolean logical quantities (e.g. logic values from the set { 0, 1 }), and an extension to a non-discrete continuous logic space on the range [0, 1] is proposed, its methods utilizing logic tables are shown, and several examples and code samples are provided.\n1Observe that the value of the quantity i in Table 4 does not affect the output of the function."

A value from the set {0, 1}, e.g. a “Boolean” value.\n2. A value from an arbitrary set S = {s0, s1, ...sn}), e.g. a discrete or “crisp” value.\n3. A value from the range [0,1], e.g. a continuous or “fuzzy” value.\n4. A special value UNKNOWN, e.g. provision for an “unknown” value.\nDefinition 2.3 A “fuzzification” after [4] is a mapping W → Z, e.g. a “fuzzification function”, and may be a mathematical operation that performs the mapping from a world value to a logic value when W is represented in numeric form.\nDefinition 2.4 A “Logic Question” is one of:\n1. A question answerable by a value from the set {0, 1}, e.g. a “Boolean” question.\n2. A question answerable from an arbitrary set S of states, e.g. a discrete or “crisp” question.\n3. A question answerable by a value from the range [0,1], e.g. a continuous or “fuzzy” question.\nDefinition 2.5 A “contemplation” in this paper is a Fuzzy Control System process after [4], as follows:\n1. A fuzzification of a set of world values W into a set of logic values Z (e.g. a perception).\n2. A contemplation on a set of logic values Z, e.g. an answering of a series of logic questions, in this paper using Boolean methods in continuous mathematical form.\n3. A defuzzification of some resulting logic value from Z into a world value W (e.g. a motive action).\nIn Problem 9.1 further in the paper we apply the fuzzy control system process by gathering a collection of world values which we are interested in, and organize them into a set W which we may further utilize.\nWe observe that world values are of any arbitrary units and form, and so we mathematically normalize them by utilizing a set of fuzzification functions to transform the world values into logic values which we may further contemplate upon.\nWe define logic values in Definition 2.2 to describe the various types of numeric values and their interpretations as utilized in this paper.\nWe answer logic questions with the methods in the paper, and produce logic values. When the logic value is strictly numeric we may further utilize its value mathematically. We may transform the logic value into a world value, or otherwise act upon it, through an action known as defuzzification.\nWe can observe that the action of forming a logic question is an inductive step, and the act of answering a logic question via one or more conditions upon which the question depends, is an example of a deductive step.\nExamples are shown further in this paper of logic tables answering logic questions."

      "text" : "We define logic tables in this paper by Definition 3.1. We may think of a logic table as accepting some specific input I = {i0, i1, i2, ..., ii} where each element of the set I is assigned some logic value. Then the items in the set I are implicitly interpreted as having a subjective meaning (e.g. health, shields, distance, etc.) and so the set I represents a specific situation within which the logic table is able to produce some specific output O which is itself a single logic value. Like the input values, the output value also has a subjective meaning which can be interpreted as either a computation or a contemplation of logic, so the logic table is said to output the answer to a logic question.\nDefinition 3.1 A “Logic Table” consists of:\n1. The set I of inputs {i0, i1, i2, ..., ii} where each element of I is a logic value. When values are assigned to each member of I, the set represents a specific situation under which the logic table will compute the answer to a configured question.\n2. The set O of outputs {o0, o1, o2, ..., oj} where each element of O is a logic value. The values in the set O each describe a specific response that the table defines for some recognized input situation.\n3. The set M of matrix values {m0,0,m0,1,m0,2, ...,mi,j} where each element of M is a logic value. The values in the set M describe the situations within which the corresponding outputs from O are produced.\nWe can then observe that the definitions of Boolean logical operations in Tables 1, 2, and 3 are themselves logic tables, as are any mathematical definition table, or any table listing a mapping of inputs to outputs.\nWe then describe how a logic table can be constructed and an equation produced which computationally maps the configured inputs to the configured outputs, and we apply the process to produce a mathematical programming of a game character’s logic."

These are quantities which may be considered to be of any form or composition. The set W for this example is then given in Table 5.\nOur next step is to apply a normalization of the values from W into the character’s [0,1] logic space. This step is called the fuzzification step after [4].\nThen let the set S = {s1, s2, s3, ..., ss} be the arbitrary set of normalized sensor values. These are continuous logic values on the range [0,1] and represent continuous Boolean logic (to distinguish it from discrete Boolean logic). We infer this set of values from the set W as shown in Table 6.\nWhere the miscellaneous mathematical functions such as “clamp” and “map” are listed in Table 7, and are being used to perform the conversion W → S, and are called fuzzification functions.

In particular, we may multiply the logic value of whether to drive forward with a value representing how fast to travel at maximum, and apply it to the character’s position causing the character to travel forward. We may also defuzzify the logical quantities about turning right or left by multiplying each of them by a quantity depicting how much to turn at maximum, and then turning in whichever direction represents a greater recommendation value, and we may defuzzify the logical quantity about throwing the ball, by evaluating whether it exceeds a threshold value (such as 0.90). We pick up the ball when the character is sufficiently close to it, setting the appropriate world variable, w7, to 1, and release the ball when the character decides to throw it by setting the variable to 0, and we apply motion to the ball depicting it thrown. We then reset the position of the ball, and we observe that the character plays a primitive game of soccer, picking up the ball, carrying it to, and throwing it in the goal, and will continue doing so perpetually as long as the character runs."
