{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "The Preimage of Rectifier Network Activities", "abstract": "The preimage of the activity at a certain level of a deep network is the set of inputs that result in the same node activity. For fully connected multi layer rectifier networks we demonstrate how to compute the preimages of activities at arbitrary levels from knowledge of the parameters in a deep rectifying network. If the preimage set of a certain activity in the network contains elements from more than one class it means that these classes are irreversibly mixed. This implies that preimage sets which are piecewise linear manifolds are building blocks for describing the input manifolds specific classes, i.e. all preimages should ideally be from the same class. We believe that the knowledge of how to compute preimages will be valuable in understanding the efficiency displayed by deep learning networks and could potentially be used in designing more efficient training algorithms.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "I really appreciate the directions the authors are taken and I think something quite interesting can come out of it.

The authors introduce a 'pseudocode' to compute preimages of (generally non-invertible) half-rectified layers, and discuss potential implications of their method with manifold-type models for signal classes. \n \n The reviewers agreed that, while this is an interesting and important question, the paper is currently poorly organized, and leaves the reader a bit disoriented, since the analysis is incomplete. The AC thus recommends rejection of the manuscript. \n \n As an addendum, the AC thinks that the authors should make an effort to reorganize the paper and clearly state the contributions, and not expect the reader to find them out on their own. In this field of machine learning, I see contributions as being either (i) theoretical, in which case we expect to see theorems and proofs, (ii) algorithmical, in which case an algorithmic is presented, studied, extensively tested, and laid out in such a way that the interested reader can use it, or (iii) experimental, in which case we expect to see improved numerical performance in some dataset. Currently the paper has none of these contributions. \n Also, a very related reference seems to be missing: \"Signal Recovery from Pooling Representations\", Bruna ,Szlam and Lecun, ICML'14, in which the invertibility of ReLU layers is precisely characterized (proposition 2.2).", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Nice premise but somewhat incomplete?", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "Summary:\nThis paper looks at the structure of the preimage of a particular activity at a hidden layer of a network. It proves that any particular activity has a preimage of a piecewise linear set of subspaces.\n\nPros:\nFormalizing the geometry of the preimages of a particular activity vector would increase our understanding of networks\n\nCons:\nAnalysis seems quite preliminary, and no novel theoretical results or clear practical conclusions.\n\nThe main theoretical conclusion seems to be the preimage being this stitch of lower dimensional subspaces? Would a direct inductive approach have worked? (e.g. working backwards from the penultimate layer say?)

I feel that that paper should be cited here and the connections should be discussed. In particular, that paper also contains a discussion on the local linear maps of ReLU networks. \n\n- I am curious about the practical considerations when computing the pre-images. The definition should be rather straight forward really, but the implementation / computation could be troublesome. \n\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS \n- On page 1 ``can easily be shown to be many to one'' in general. \n\n- On page 2 ``For each point x^{l+1}'' The parentheses in the superscript are missing. \n\n- After eq. 6 ``the mapping is unique''  is missing `when w1 and w2 are linearly independent' \n\n- Eq. 1 should be a vector. \n\n- Above eq. 3. ``collected the weights a_i into the vector w'' and bias b. Period is missing. \n\n- On page 2 ``... illustrate the preimage for the case of points on the lines ... respectively'' \nPlease indicate which is which.  \n\n- In Figure 1. Is this a sketch, or the actual illustration of a network. In the latter case, please state the specific value of x and the weights that are depicted. Also define and explain the arrows precisely. \nWhat are the arrows in the gray part? \n\n- On page 3 `` This means that the preimage is just the point x^{(l)}''  the points that W maps to x^{(l+1)}. \n\n- On page 3 the first display equation.

Nullspaces of linear maps should pass through the origin. \n\n- `` from pairwise intersections'' \\cap \n\n- ``indicated as arrows or the shaded area'' this description is far from clear. \n\n- typos: peieces, diminsions, netork, me, \n \n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "19 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"TITLE": "not ready yet", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "comments": "I really appreciate the directions the authors are taken and I think something quite interesting can come out of it.
