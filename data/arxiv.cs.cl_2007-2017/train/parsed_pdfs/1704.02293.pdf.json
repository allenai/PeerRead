      "text" : "This article compares four probabilistic algorithms (global algorithms) for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in terms of the number of scorer calls (local algorithm) and the F1 score as determined by a gold-standard scorer. Two algorithms come from the state of the art, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well as two algorithms that we first adapt from WSD that are state of the art probabilistic search algorithms, namely a Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and a Bat Search algorithm (BS). As WSD requires to evaluate exponentially many word sense combinations (with branching factors of up to 6 or more), probabilistic algorithms allow to find approximate solution in a tractable time by sampling the search space. We find that CSA, GA and SA all eventually converge to similar results (0.98 F1 score), but CSA gets there faster (in fewer scorer calls) and reaches up to 0.95 F1 before SA in fewer scorer calls. In BA a strict convergence criterion prevents it from reaching above 0.89 F1.\nKeywords: Word Sense Disambiguation, local algorithms, global algorithms, Stochastic optimization algorithms, comparison of global algorithms, Simulated Annealing Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, Bat Algorithm, Cuckoo Search Algorithm"

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a complex task that consists in finding the best sense of each word of a text with relation to the surrounding words (context). It is a fundamental problem in Natural Language Processing, which\nPreprint submitted to Swarm and Evolutionary Computation April 10, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n02 29\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\ncan help in performing tasks like the automatic extraction of multilingual information or machine translation. A lot of research has already been carried out on WSD. Consequently, there are many approaches, including fully supervised methods (make use of sense-annotated corpora to train supervised classifiers) and similarity-based methods (rely on dictionaries, thesauri and more generally knowledge sources). Fully supervised methods require large hand-annotated corpora, a somewhat rare and expensive resource that must be crafted specifically for a particular sense inventory, language even domain. Moreover, a supervised classifier requires at least 1000 examples/word to achieve a stable performance, while there are at most 200/word in the largest sense-annotated corpora [7]. Due to this bottleneck, similarity-based methods perform on par with supervised algorithms on standard evaluation datasets. While there are few prospects for improvement with supervised system, similarity-based systems offer many avenues for improvement even for English (the best resourced language) [12].\nIn this article, we focus on similarity-based methods, which rely on the notion of global and local algorithms. Local algorithms compute a similarity measure between two senses of two words of the text. Global algorithms make use of the local similarities to find the most suitable sense for each word of the text. The execution time is exponential in the size of the input, thus requiring the use of a window of limited width around each word when evaluating sense combination. The problem can become intractable even for short sentences: a linguistically motivated context, such as a paragraph for instance would be intractable. Probabilistic approaches attempt to alleviate the intractability by exploring only a sampling of the search space in order to find an approximate solution as close to the optimal solution as possible. Probabilistic sampling approaches have been successfully used for decades for complex optimisation where the geometry (and the precise formula) of the search function are unknown (non differentiable). Two classical algorithms that belong to this category are Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms and have been successfully used for WSD in past years. However, since the appearance of SA and GA there have been many new and more efficient probabilistic optimisation algorithms, in particular two of them that are at the state of the art of the field (in classical computational model, thus excluding quantum versions). However, Bat Optimisation and Cuckoo Optimisation have never been applied to Word Sense Disambiguation, a combinatorial problem more difficult in magnitudes (number of parameters and branching factor of the search space) compared to classical NP-complete combinatorial problem (e.g. the travelling salesman algorithm).\nAfter a presentation of similarity-based methods for Word Sense Disambigua-\ntion, we present existing global algorithms and in particular the Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) and the Genetic Algorithm. We then introduce our adaptation of Bat Search and Cuckoo Optimisation for WSD."

      "heading" : "2. Similarity-based Word Sense Disambiguation",
      "text" : "Similarity-based word sense disambiguation rests on the notion of local algorithm and global algorithm introduced by Schwab et al. [10].\nA local algorithm gives a similarity measure between two pairs of (word/sense). For example, considering the sentence ”Your algorithm contains many bugs”, if we compute the similarity measure between the pair (algorithm/piece of code) and (bugs/insect) using a local algorithm, we expect to have a smaller value than if we compute the similarity measure between the pair (algorithm/piece of code) and (bugs/fault in a system).\nThen, a global algorithm will propagate these local similarity measures to an upper level, in order to achieve the actual disambiguation of a complete document. In general, global algorithms are heuristic. Indeed, in a large document, we cannot compute the local similarity measure algorithm for every possible (word/sense) pair. For example, if we consider a 500 word text with 5 senses for each word, there are 5005 possibilities. Even if the local algorithm could run in 1 nanosecond (which it clearly doesn’t), it would still take approximately one year to evaluate all combinations\nGlobal algorithms represent a particular combination of sense assignments as a configuration and make use of a scoring function (a.k.a. scorer or fitness function) to evaluate the fitness of the configuration.\nA configuration is the set of all (word/sense) associations, for every word in a document, we say that a configuration annotates each word of the text with a sense. That is, for example, if a document contains 100 words that we need to annotate with senses, a possible configuration for this document is a vector of dimension 100, where for every index i ∈ [0, 100[ (the position of the word in the document) is assigned an integer j in the range of the possible senses indexes for this word.\nA configuration scorer, scorer, or fitness function, is a measurement of the quality of a configuration. Generally, it can be as simple as the sum of all similarity measure for every (word/sense) pair in a configuration, using a particular local algorithm.\nGiven these definitions, and knowing that we cannot compute the fitness score of every single combination in the search space, global algorithms use heuristics to\nmaximise the exploration of the configuration space while minimizing the number of evaluations of the fitness function.\nThis paper will focus on the compared performance of four different global algorithms: a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA), a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a Bat Algorithm (BA) and a Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA)."

This approach is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where the sturdiness of the metal is increased by controlling the rate of cooling applied to it [3]. In context of WSD, the “metal” is simply the configuration of all (word/sense) pairs in the text.\nThe algorithm works in cycles. Each cycle is composed of iterations. At each iteration a single random change is made in the configuration: the sense assigned to a random word in the text is changed to another sense randomly (uniform distribution) and the score of the modified configuration is computed. If the new configuration has a higher score than the configuration before the modification, it replaces the previous configuration. Otherwise, we compute a probability of accepting the new configuration anyway despite the fact it has a lower score. The acceptance probability is classically computed following a Boltzmann distribution. Simulated annealing is a particular instance of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [6]. The strategy of accepting lower scores is a mechanism that allows escaping from local minima that typically abound in complex highly dimensional search spaces.\n1http://getalp.imag.fr/static/wsd/Vial-et-al-global-howto/"

The idea of GA is to consider search space configurations as individuals in a population.\nGA starts with an initial population, where a certain number of the fittest individuals (as evaluated by the fitness function) will be crossed with each other (crossover operation), that is parts of the configurations will be swapped between two individuals.\nThen, a certain number of random changes (mutation operator]) are applied to the population (like for SAA but repeated). Finally a subset of the fittest the new population are selected and kept (elitism). Variants of GA copy the best individual in proportion to their fitness in the new population. A convergence criterion is used to determine when the population converges and when there are no more beneficial evolutions taking place.\nGA was first adapted to WSD by Gelbukh et al.[2] where the population is a set of configurations, and the fitness function is the configuration scorer."

These bats emit a very loud ultrasound pulse (inaudible to humans) and listen for the echo that bounces back on the boundaries of the environment and of the objects therein in order to pinpoint their position and the positions of their prey. A sound pulse is characterised by its frequency, rate of emission and loudness. There are different sound pulses depending on the situation and context. When the bat is searching for prey, the loudness is at its highest and the rate of emission is very low (rough sketch of the environment). Once a prey is located, the bat\nlowers the loudness and increase the rate of emission in order to track the prey with precision.\nThe particularity of this algorithm is its ability to converge to a promising region of the search space rapidly while concurrently exploring alternative areas."

      "text" : "In order to tailor implementations of those algorithms as global algorithms for WSD, we need to make a number of assumptions and modifications to the original algorithms.\nThe original algorithms specify the movement of bats or cuckoos with a vector with real coordinated (characterize by a direction and a norm). Given that WSD is a discrete problem, the definitions of what a movement means must be adapted as a vector with real coordinates does not exist. Moreover all senses are semantically distinct and independent and there isn’t any meaningful relative distance between them, thus moving from sense #1 to sense #2 is no less significant than moving from sense #1 to sense #4. For example, in the WordNet 3.1 lexical database, the sense #1 of the noun ”mouse” corresponds to the animal, whereas the sense #2, #3 and #4 correspond respectively to ”a black eye”, ”a person who is timid” and ”a computer device”. It is clear that the sense #2 is not closer to the sense #1 than the sense #3 or #4. The position of the bats in the BA and of the cuckoos in the CSA in the search space is represented by the configuration that assigns a sense\nto each word of the text (word/sense) for a given text (that is, a configuration is a particular solution to our problem). We adapt the original definition by using the velocity of bats and the Lévy flight for cuckoos to change the current position of the agents by making random changes to their correspond configuration just like for GA and SA.\nFor example, a flight of distance 5 will have the effect of performing 5 random changes in the configuration of a cuckoo. The same is true for the velocity of bats.\nThe algorithms were implemented in Java2 and a detailed code is provided in Appendix B."

For example, in previous implementation of SAA and GA for WSD, the Lesk similarity measure that calculates the overlap between the definitions of senses [4] was used. Given that we are merely interested in the global algorithms, in this article we make the choice to use the F1 score from the gold standard scorer as the objective function for the optimisation, in other words, the local algorithm is an oracle from the point of view of the local algorithm so as to reduce the problem from AI-complete to an NP-complete optimisation problem and to be able to evaluate only the influence of the global algorithm."

Given that with 4000 calls, the appearance of the charts suggest that convergence has not occurred. Thus, we make two additional executions with a limit of 8000 (Figure 1e) and 16000 (Figure 1f) scorer calls, with the same parameters as the run with the limit at 4000 scorer calls.\nWe see that across the 6 experiments, the progression of the average F1 score compared to the average number of scorer calls remains the same, thus we will make a sweeping analysis across all size experiments. Lower limits to the number\nof scorer calls can be seen as a different ”zoom levels” at the beginning of the execution.\nBelow 20 calls, SA cannot yet obtain a solution, while CSA obtains the best F1 (0.6) followed by BS (0.59) followed by GA (0.55). After 100 scorer calls, the order stabilizes and we have CSA first (0.7), followed by BS (0.68) followed by GA (0.65) followed by SA (0.6). Until 500 calls, all algorithms except SA follow a slow increase (from 0.70 to 0.79 for CSA, from 0.68 to 0.71 for BA, from 0.65 to 0.67 for GA) while SA stagnates at 0.60. After 500 the algorithm continue the trend, however SA catches up rapidly and starts to overtake GA at 600 scorer calls (0.68 F1) and BS at 1400 scorer calls (0.8 F1 and stays above them). GA overtakes bat search after 3400 scorer calls and SA seems to overtake CSA after 4000 scorer evaluations.\nIn order to better see if SA continues to rise after overtaking CSA, we perform two additional experiments with limits of 8000 and then 16000 scorer calls. In the long run The bat algorithm converges slightly below 0.90 F1 while, CSA, GA and SA all converge (0.98 F1) and continue rising, likely reaching a F1 of 1 eventually.\nWhile all algorithms save for BS all converge to the same solutions, for lower counts of scorer calls, CSA gets better results with fewer scorer evaluations. This will be particularly advantageous for scorer functions that are costly to compute and where simulated annealing or GA will be prohibitive. Indeed, for these experiments we used a perfect scoring function that is very fast to calculate. However, typical heuristic scoring functions used when there is no gold-standard data available, such as Lesk are much more costly and may not allow to reach enough scorer calls to reach the point where SA overtakes CSA is a tractable time.\nAs for the lacklustre performance of BS, after a point (depending on the loudness parameter) BS stops accepting the configurations even if they are better (the target is acquired by the bat), which likely explains the early convergence of the algorithm."

      "text" : "In this paper, we adapt two state of the art probabilistic search algorithms as global algorithms the Word Sense Disambiguation problem : a Bat Algorithm and a Cuckoo Search Algorithm. We further adapt Cuckoo search to perform parameter estimation for probabilistic global WSD algorithms. We compared the two algorithms to two existing implementation of classical probabilistic optimisation algorithms, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm. We make a comparative evaluation using the F1 score computed from the gold standard of\nthe Semeval 2007 Task 7 WSD task against the number of calls to the scoring function. We used an oracle objective function in order to only evaluate the influence of the global algorithm on the results, rather than letting the heuristic scoring function have an influence as well. We find that CSA, SA and GA all converge at around 16000 scorer calls and that SA slightly overtakes CSA after 4000 calls, while CSA gets there faster (in much fewer scorer calls). While the scorer used here was perfect and fast to compute (comparison to the gold-standard), actual heuristic scorer are much slower and may not allow to tractably reach the point where SA overtakes CSA. Thus, we conclude that CSA is a much better sampler of the WSD search space and that it should be preferred to SA and GA. We also conclude that because BS stops accepting solutions after a while (inherent to the algorithm, not an explicit convergence criterion) the convergence is too fast.\nIn this work we only considered a perfect scorer, however we currently work on evaluating and comparing with an actual heuristic scoring function and on studying the correlation between the oracle objective function and the heuristic scoring function. This study will then allow to optimize and adapt the heuristic scoring function to be more like the oracle scoring function on the same subset of the data we used to evaluate the parameters for the global algorithms."

Two algorithms come from the state of the art, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well as two algorithms that we first adapt from WSD that are state of the art probabilistic search algorithms, namely a Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and a Bat Search algorithm (BS). As WSD requires to evaluate exponentially many word sense combinations (with branching factors of up to 6 or more), probabilistic algorithms allow to find approximate solution in a tractable time by sampling the search space. We find that CSA, GA and SA all eventually converge to similar results (0.98 F1 score), but CSA gets there faster (in fewer scorer calls) and reaches up to 0.95 F1 before SA in fewer scorer calls. In BA a strict convergence criterion prevents it from reaching above 0.89 F1.",
