    "abstractText" : "We study the connection between kappa cal­ culus and probabilistic reasoning in diagnosis applications. Specifically, we abstract a prob­ abilistic belief network for diagnosing faults into a kappa network and compare the order­ ing of faults computed using both methods. We show that, at least for the example exam­ ined, the ordering of faults coincide as long as all the causal relations in the original prob­ abilistic network are taken into account. We also provide a formal analysis of some net­ work structures where the two methods will differ. Both kappa rankings and infinitesimal prob­ abilities have been used extensively to study default reasoning and belief revision. But lit­ tle has been done on utilizing their connec­ tion as outlined above. This is partly be­ cause the relation between kappa and prob­ ability calculi assumes that probabilities are arbitrarily close to one (or zero). The exper­ iments in this paper investigate this relation when this assumption is not satisfied. The reported results have important implications on the use of kappa rankings to enhance the knowledge engineering of uncertainty models.",
