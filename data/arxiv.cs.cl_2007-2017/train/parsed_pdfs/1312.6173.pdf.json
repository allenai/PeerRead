      "text" : "Distributed representations of meaning are a natural way to encode covariance relationships between words and phrases in NLP. By overcoming data sparsity problems, as well as providing information about semantic relatedness which is not available in discrete representations, distributed representations have proven useful in many NLP tasks. In particular, recent work has shown how compositional semantic representations can successfully be applied to a number of monolingual applications such as sentiment analysis. At the same time, there has been some initial success in work on learning shared word-level representations across languages. We combine these two approaches by proposing a method for learning compositional representations in a multilingual setup. Our model learns to assign similar embeddings to aligned sentences and dissimilar ones to sentence which are not aligned while not requiring word alignments. We show that our representations are semantically informative and apply them to a cross-lingual document classification task where we outperform the previous state of the art. Further, by employing parallel corpora of multiple language pairs we find that our model learns representations that capture semantic relationships across languages for which no parallel data was used."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Distributed representations of words are increasingly being used to achieve high levels of generalisation within language modelling tasks. Successful applications of this approach include word-sense disambiguation, word similarity and synonym detection (e.g. [9, 24]). Subsequent work has also attempted to learn distributed semantics of larger structures, allowing us to apply distributed representation to tasks such as sentiment analysis or paraphrase detection (i.a. [1, 3, 11, 13, 19, 22]). At the same time a second strand of work has focused on transferring linguistic knowledge across languages, and particularly from English into low-resource languages, by means of distributed representations at the word level [12, 15].\nCurrently, work on compositional semantic representations focuses on monolingual data while the cross-lingual work focuses on word level representations only. However, it appears logical that these two strands of work should be combined as there exists a plethora of parallel corpora with aligned data at the sentence level or beyond which could be exploited in such work. Further, sentence aligned data provides a plausible concept of semantic similarity, which can be harder to define at the word level. Consider the case of alignment between a German compound noun (e.g. “Schwerlastverkehr”) and its English equivalent (“heavy goods vehicle traffic”). Semantic alignment at the phrase level here appears far more plausible than aligning individual tokens for semantic transfer.\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n61 73\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n2 0\nD ec\nUsing this rationale, and building on both work related to learning cross-lingual embeddings as well as to compositional semantic representations, we introduce a model that learns cross-lingual embeddings at the sentence level. In the following section we will briefly discuss prior work in these two fields before going on to describe the bilingual training signal that we developed for learning multilingual compositional embeddings. Subsequently, we will describe our model in greater detail as well as its training procedure and experimental setup. Finally, we perform a number of evaluations and demonstrate that our training signal allows a very simple compositional vector model to outperform the state of the art on a task designed to evaluate its ability to transfer semantic information across languages. Unlike other work in this area, our model does not require word aligned data. In fact, while we evaluate our model on sentence aligned data in this paper, there is no theoretical requirement for this and technically our algorithm could also be applied to document-level parallel data or even comparable data only."

      "text" : "In the case of representing individual words as vectors, the distributional account of semantics provides a plausible explanation of what is encoded in a word vector. This follows the idea that the meaning of a word can be determined by “the company it keeps” [10], that is by the context it appears in. Such context can easily be encoded in vectors using collocational methods, and is also underlying other methods of learning word embeddings [7, 18].\nFor a number of important problems, semantic representations of individual words do not suffice, but instead a semantic representation of a larger structure—e.g. a phrase or a sentence—is required. This was highlighted in [9], who proposed a mechanism for modifying a word’s representation based on its individual context. The distributional account of semantics can, due to sparsity, not be applied to such larger linguistic units. A notable exception perhaps is Baroni and Zamparelli [1], who learned distributional representations for adjective noun pairs using a collocational approach on a corpus of unprecedented size. The bigram representations learned from that corpus were subsequently used to learn lexicalised composition functions for the constituent words.\nMost alternative attempts to extract such higher-level semantic representations have focused on learning composition functions that represent the semantics of a larger structure as a function of the representations of its parts. [19] provides an evaluation of a number of simple composition functions applied to bigrams. Applied recursively, such approaches can then easily be reconciled with the co-occurrence based word level representations. There are a number of proposals motivating such recursive or deep composition models. Notably, [3] propose a tensor-based model for semantic composition and, similarly, [4] develop a framework for semantic composition by combining distributional theory with pregroup grammars. The latter framework was empirically evaluated and supported by the results in [11]. More recently, various forms of recursive neural networks have successfully been used for semantic composition and related tasks such as sentiment analysis. Such models include recursive autoencoders [21], matrix-vector recursive neural networks [22], untied recursive neural networks [13] or convolutional networks [14]."

      "heading" : "2.1 Multilingual Embeddings",
      "text" : "Much research has been devoted to the task of inducing distributed semantic representations for single languages. In particular English, with its large number of annotated resources, has enjoyed most attention. Recently, progress has been made at representation learning for languages with fewer available resources. Klementiev et al. [15] described a form of multi-agent learning on word-aligned parallel data to transfer embeddings from one language to another. Earlier work, Haghighi et al. [12], proposed a method for inducing cross-lingual lexica using monolingual feature representations and a small initial lexicon to bootstrap with. This approach has recently been extended by [16, 17], who developed a method for learning transformation matrices to convert semantic vectors of one language into those of another. Is was demonstrated that this approach can be applied to improve tasks related to machine translation. Their CBOW model is also worth noting for its similarities to the composition function used in this paper. Using a slightly different approach, [26], also learned bilingual embeddings for machine translation. It is important to note that, unlike our proposed system, all of these methods require word aligned parallel data for training.\nSo far almost all of this work has been focused on learning multilingual representations at the word level. As distributed representations of larger expressions have been shown to be highly useful for a number of tasks, it seems to be a natural next step to attempt to induce these, too, cross-lingually. With this paper we make a first step into that direction."

      "text" : "Language acquisition in humans is widely seen as grounded in sensory-motor experience [20, 2]. Based on this idea, there have been some attempts at using multi-modal data for learning better vector representations of words (e.g. [23]). Such methods, however, are not easily scalable across languages or to large amounts of data for which no secondary or tertiary representation might exist.\nWe abstract the underlying principle one step further and attempt to learn semantics from multilingual data. The idea is that, given enough parallel data, a shared representation would be forced to capture the common elements between sentences from different languages. What two parallel sentences have in common, of course, is the semantics of those two sentences. Using this data, we propose a novel method for learning vector representations at the word level and beyond."

      "heading" : "3.1 Bilingual Signal",
      "text" : "Exploiting the semantic similarity of parallel sentences across languages, we can define a simple bilingual (and trivially multilingual) error function as follows: Given a compositional sentence model (CVM) MA, which maps a sentence to a vector, we can train a second CVM MB using a corpus CA,B of parallel data from the language pair A,B. For each pair of parallel sentences (a, b) ∈ CA,B , we attempt to minimize\nEbi(a, b) = ‖aroot − broot‖2 (1)\nwhere aroot is the vector representing sentence a and broot the vector representing sentence b."

      "heading" : "3.2 The BICVM Model",
      "text" : "A CVM learns semantic representations of larger syntactic units given the semantic representations of their constituents. We assume individual words to be represented by vectors (x ∈ Rn).\nPrevious methods employ binary parse trees on the data (e.g. [13, 22]) and use weighted or multiplicative composition functions. Under such a setup, where each node in the tree is terminal or has two children (p→ c0, c1), a binary composition function could take the following form:\np = g (W e[c0; c1] + b e) (2)\nwhere [c0; c1] is the concatenation of the two child vectors, W e ∈ Rn×2n and be ∈ Rn the encoding matrix and bias, respectively, and g an element-wise activation function such as the hyperbolic tangent. For the purposes of evaluation the bilingual signal proposed above, we simplify this composition function by setting all weight matrices to the identity and all biases to zero. Thereby the CVM reduces to a simple additive composition function:\naroot = n∑ i=0 ai (3)\nUsing this additive CVM we want to optimize the bilingual error signal defined above (Eq. 1). For the moment, assume thatMA is a perfectly trained CVM such that aroot represents the semantics of the sentence a. Further, due to the use of parallel data, we know that a and b are semantically equivalent. Hence we transfer the semantic knowledge contained in MA onto MB , by learning θMB to minimize:\nEbi(CA,B) = ∑\n(a,b)∈CA,B\nEbi(a, b) (4)\nOf course, this objective function assumes a full trained model which we do not have at this stage. While this can be a useful objective for transferring linguistic knowledge into low-resource languages [15], this precondition is not helpful when there is no model to learn from in first place. We resolve this issue by jointly training both modelsMA andMB . Applying Ebi to parallel data ensures that both models learn a shared representation at the sentence level. As the parallel input sentences share the same meaning, it is reasonable to assume that minimizing Ebi will force the model to learn their semantic representation. Let θbi = θMA ∩ θMB . The joint objective function J(θbi) thus becomes:\nJ(θbi) = Ebi(CA,B) + λ\n2 ‖θbi‖2 (5)\nwhere λ‖θbi‖1 is the L2 regularization term. It is apparent that this joint objective J(θbi) is degenerate. The models could learn to reduce all embeddings and composition weights to zero and thereby minimize the objective function. We address this issue by employing a form of contrastive estimation penalizing small distances between non-parallel sentence pairs. For every pair of parallel sentences (a, b) we sample a number of additional sentences n ∈ CB , which—with high probability—are not exact translations of a. This is comparable to the second term of the loss function of a large margin nearest neighbour classifier (see Eq. 12 in [25]):\nEnoise(a, b, n) = [1− Ebi(a, b) + Ebi(a, n)]+ (6)\nwhere [x]+ = max(x, 0) denotes the standard hinge loss. Thus, the final objective function for the BICVM model is:\nJ(θbi) = ∑\n(a,b)∈C\n( k∑\ni=1\nEnoise(a, b, ni) + λ\n2 ‖θbi‖2\n) (7)"

In particular, as the objective function is differentiable, we can use standard gradient descent techniques such as stochastic gradient descent, L-BFGS or the adaptive gradient algorithm (AdaGrad). Within each monolingual CVM, we use backpropagation through structure after applying the joint error to each sentence level node."

In future work we will investigate the effect of these parameters in greater detail. For the time being we used the following values. L2 regularization (1), step-size (0.1), number of noise elements (50), margin size (50), embedding dimensionality (d = 128). The noise elements samples were randomly drawn from the corpus at training time. We use the Europarl corpus (v7)1 for training the bilingual model. The corpus was pre-processed using the set of tools provided by cdec2 for tokenizing and lowercasing the data. Further, all empty sentences as well as their translations were removed from the corpus.\nWe present results from two experiments. The BICVM model was trained on 500k sentence pairs of the English-German parallel section of the Europarl corpus. The BICVM+ model used this dataset in combination with another 500k parallel sentences from the English-French section of the corpus, resulting in 1 million English sentences, each paired up with either a German or a French sentence. Each language’s vocabulary used distinct encodings to avoid potential overlap.\nThe motivation behind BICVM+ is to investigate whether we can learn better embeddings by introducing additional data in a different language. This is similar to prior work in machine translation where English was used as a pivot for translation between low-resource languages [5].\nWe use the adaptive gradient method, AdaGrad [8], for updating the weights of our models, and terminate training for the BICVM model after 10 iterations. The BICVM+ model converges more slowly and was terminated after 50 iterations. Results for the BICVM model did not significantly alter between 10 and 50 iterations."

      "text" : "We evaluate our model using the cross-lingual document classification (CLDC) task of Klementiev et al. [15]. This task involves learning language independent embeddings which are then used for document classification across the English-German language pair. For this, CLDC employs a particular kind of supervision, namely using supervised training data in one language and evaluating without supervision in another. Thus, CLDC is a good task for establishing whether our learned representations are semantically useful across multiple languages.\nWe follow the experimental setup described in [15], with the exception that we learn our embeddings using solely the Europarl data and only use the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 corpora during the classifier training and testing stages. Each document in the classification task is represented by the average of the d-dimensional representations of all its sentences. We train the multiclass classifier using the same settings and implementation of the averaged perceptron classifier [6] as used in [15].\n1http://www.statmt.org/europarl/ 2https://github.com/redpony/cdec\nWe ran the CLDC experiments both by training on English and testing on German documents and vice versa. Using the data splits provided by [15], we used varying training data sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents for training the multiclass classifier. The results of this task across training sizes are shown in Figure 2. Table 1 shows the results for training on 1,000 documents.\nBoth models, BICVM and BICVM+ outperform all prior work on this task. It is interesting to note that BICVM+ outperforms the BICVM model when training on English data, but performs worse when training on German data and evaluating on English text."

Of particular interest should be the right chart, which highlights bilingual embeddings between French\nand German words. Even though the model did not use any parallel French-German data during training, it still managed to learn semantic word-word similarity across these two languages."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "With this paper we have proposed a novel method for inducing cross-lingual distributed representations for compositional semantics. Using a very simple method for semantic composition, we nevertheless managed to obtain state of the art results on the CLDC task, specifically designed to evaluate semantic transfer across languages. After extending our approach to include multilingual training data in the BICVM+ model, we were able to demonstrate that adding additional languages further improves the model. Furthermore, using some qualitative experiments and visualizations, we showed that our approach also allows us to learn semantically related embeddings across languages without any direct training data.\nOur approach provides great flexibility in training data and requires little to no annotation. Having demonstrated the successful training of semantic representations using sentence aligned data, a plausible next step is to attempt training using document-aligned data or even corpora of comparable documents. This may provide even greater possibilities for working with low-resource languages.\nIn the same vein, the success of our pivoting experiments suggest further work. Unlike other pivot approaches, it is easy to extend our model to have multiple pivot languages. Thus some pivots could preserve different aspects such as case, gender etc., and overcome other issues related to having a single pivot language.\nHaving achieved state of the art results when using our method for learning cross-lingual vectors in combination with a very simple CVM provides another avenue of further work. We will investigate more complex compositional vector models such as MV-RNN [22] or tensor-based approaches, to see whether these can further improve results on both mono- and multilingual tasks when used in conjunction with our cross-lingual objective function. Related to this, we will also apply our model to a wider variety of tasks including machine translation and multilingual information extraction."

By overcoming data sparsity problems, as well as providing information about semantic relatedness which is not available in discrete representations, distributed representations have proven useful in many NLP tasks. In particular, recent work has shown how compositional semantic representations can successfully be applied to a number of monolingual applications such as sentiment analysis. At the same time, there has been some initial success in work on learning shared word-level representations across languages. We combine these two approaches by proposing a method for learning compositional representations in a multilingual setup. Our model learns to assign similar embeddings to aligned sentences and dissimilar ones to sentence which are not aligned while not requiring word alignments. We show that our representations are semantically informative and apply them to a cross-lingual document classification task where we outperform the previous state of the art. Further, by employing parallel corpora of multiple language pairs we find that our model learns representations that capture semantic relationships across languages for which no parallel data was used.",
