      "text" : "Knowing and understanding the traffic conditions and phenomena over road networks has become increasingly important to the goal of achieving smooth-flowing, congestion-free traffic, especially in densely-populated urban cities. According to a 2011 urban mobility report (Schrank et al., 2011), traffic congestion in the USA has caused 1.9 billion gallons of extra fuel, 4.8 billion hours of travel delay, and $101 billion of delay and fuel cost. Such huge resource wastage can potentially be mitigated if the\nspatiotemporally varying traffic phenomena (e.g., speeds and travel times along road segments) are predicted accurately enough in real time to detect and forecast the congestion hotspots; network-level (e.g., ramp metering, road pricing) and user-level (e.g., route replanning) measures can then be taken to relieve this congestion, so as to improve the overall efficiency of road networks.\nIn practice, it is non-trivial to achieve real-time, accurate prediction of a spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomenon because the quantity of sensors that can be deployed to observe an entire road network is costconstrained. Traditionally, static sensors such as loop detectors (Krause et al., 2008a; Wang and Papageorgiou, 2005) are placed at designated locations in a road network to collect data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. However, they provide sparse coverage (i.e., many road segments are not observed, thus leading to data sparsity), incur high installation and maintenance costs, and cannot reposition by themselves in response to changes in the traffic phenomenon. Low-cost GPS technology allows the collection of traffic data using passive mobile probes (Work et al., 2010) (e.g., taxis/cabs). Unlike static sensors, they can directly measure the travel times along road segments. But, they provide fairly sparse coverage due to low GPS sampling frequency (i.e., often imposed by taxi/cab companies) and no control over their routes, incur high initial implementation cost, pose privacy issues, and produce highly-varying speeds and travel times while traversing the same road segment due to inconsistent driving behaviors. A critical mass of probes is needed on each road segment to ease the severity of the last drawback (Srinivasan and Jovanis, 1996) but is often hard to achieve on non-highway segments due to sparse coverage. In contrast, we propose the use of active mobile probes (Turner et al., 1998) to overcome the limitations of static and passive mobile probes. In particular, they can be directed to explore any segments of a road network to gather traffic data at a desired GPS sampling rate while enforcing consistent driving behavior.\nHow then do the mobile probes/sensors actively explore a road network to gather and assimilate the most informative\nar X\niv :1\n20 6.\n62 30\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 8\nJu n\n20 12\nobservations for predicting the traffic phenomenon? There are three key issues surrounding this problem, which will be discussed together with the related works:\nModels for predicting spatiotemporal traffic phenomena. The spatiotemporal correlation structure of a traffic phenomenon can be exploited to predict the traffic conditions of any unobserved road segment at any time using the observations taken along the sensors’ paths. To achieve this, existing Bayesian filtering frameworks (Chen et al., 2011; Wang and Papageorgiou, 2005; Work et al., 2010) utilize various handcrafted parametric models predicting traffic flow along a highway stretch that only correlate adjacent segments of the highway. So, their predictive performance will be compromised when the current observations are sparse and/or the actual spatial correlation spans multiple segments. Their strong Markov assumption further exacerbates this problem. It is also not shown how these models can be generalized to work for arbitrary road network topologies and more complex correlation structure. Existing multivariate parametric traffic prediction models (Kamarianakis and Prastacos, 2003; Min and Wynter, 2011) do not quantify uncertainty estimates of the predictions and impose rigid spatial locality assumptions that do not adapt to the true underlying correlation structure.\nIn contrast, we assume the traffic phenomenon over an urban road network (i.e., comprising the full range of road types like highways, arterials, slip roads) to be realized from a rich class of Bayesian non-parametric models called the Gaussian process (GP) (Section 2) that can formally characterize its spatiotemporal correlation structure and be refined with growing number of observations. More importantly, GP can provide formal measures of predictive uncertainty (e.g., based on variance or entropy criterion) for directing the sensors to explore highly uncertain areas of the road network. Krause et al. (2008a) used GP to represent the traffic phenomenon over a network of only highways and defined the correlation of speeds between highway segments to depend only on the geodesic (i.e., shortest path) distance of these segments with respect to the network topology; their features are not considered. Neumann et al. (2009) maintained a mixture of two independent GPs for flow prediction such that the correlation structure of one GP utilized road segment features while that of the other GP depended on manually specified relations (instead of geodesic distance) between segments with respect to an undirected network topology. Different from the above works, we propose a relational GP whose correlation structure exploits the geodesic distance between segments based on the topology of a directed road network with vertices denoting road segments and edges indicating adjacent segments weighted by dissimilarity of their features, hence tightly integrating the features and relational information.\nData fusion. The observations are gathered distributedly by each sensor along its path in the road network and have\nto be assimilated in order to predict the traffic phenomenon. Since a large number of observations are expected to be collected, a centralized approach to GP prediction cannot be performed in real time due to its cubic time complexity.\nTo resolve this, we propose a decentralized data fusion approach to efficient and scalable approximate GP prediction (Section 3). Existing decentralized and distributed Bayesian filtering frameworks for addressing non-traffic related problems (Chung et al., 2004; Coates, 2004; OlfatiSaber, 2005; Rosencrantz et al., 2003; Sukkarieh et al., 2003) will face the same difficulties as their centralized counterparts described above if applied to predicting traffic phenomena, thus resulting in loss of predictive performance. Distributed regression algorithms (Guestrin et al., 2004; Paskin and Guestrin, 2004) for static sensor networks gain efficiency from spatial locality assumptions, which cannot be exploited by mobile sensors whose paths are not constrained by locality. Cortes (2009) proposed a distributed data fusion approach to approximate GP prediction based on an iterative Jacobi overrelaxation algorithm, which incurs some critical limitations: (a) the past observations taken along the sensors’ paths are assumed to be uncorrelated, which greatly undermines its predictive performance when they are in fact correlated and/or the current observations are sparse; (b) when the number of sensors grows large, it converges very slowly; (c) it assumes that the range of positive correlation has to be bounded by some factor of the communication range. Our proposed decentralized algorithm does not suffer from these limitations and can be computed exactly with efficient time bounds.\nActive sensing. The sensors have to coordinate to actively gather the most informative observations for minimizing the uncertainty of modeling and predicting the traffic phenomenon. Existing centralized (Low et al., 2008, 2009a, 2011) and decentralized (Low et al., 2012; Stranders et al., 2009) active sensing algorithms scale poorly with a large number of observations and sensors. We propose a partially decentralized active sensing algorithm that overcomes these issues of scalability (Section 4).\nThis paper presents a novel Decentralized Data Fusion and Active Sensing (D2FAS) algorithm (Sections 3 and 4) for sampling spatiotemporally varying environmental phenomena with mobile sensors. Note that the decentralized data fusion component of D2FAS can also be used for static and passive mobile sensors. The practical applicability of D2FAS is not restricted to traffic monitoring; it can be used in other environmental sensing applications such as mineral prospecting (Low et al., 2007), monitoring of ocean and freshwater phenomena (Dolan et al., 2009; Podnar et al., 2010; Low et al., 2009b, 2011, 2012) (e.g., plankton bloom, anoxic zones), forest ecosystems, pollution (e.g., oil spill), or contamination (e.g., radiation leak). The specific contributions of this paper include:\n• Analyzing the time and communication overheads of\nD2FAS (Section 5): We prove that D2FAS can scale better than existing state-of-the-art centralized algorithms with a large number of observations and sensors; • Theoretically guaranteeing the predictive performance of the decentralized data fusion component of D2FAS to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the GP model (Section 3): The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm), thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction; • Theoretically guaranteeing the performance of the partially decentralized active sensing component of D2FAS, from which various practical environmental conditions can be established to improve its performance; • Developing a relational GP model whose correlation structure can exploit both the road segment features and road network topology information (Section 2.1); • Empirically evaluating the predictive performance, time efficiency, and scalability of the D2FAS algorithm on a real-world traffic phenomenon (i.e., speeds of road segments) dataset over an urban road network (Section 6): D2FAS is more time-efficient and scales significantly better with increasing number of observations and sensors while achieving predictive performance close to that of existing state-of-the-art centralized algorithms."

      "text" : "The Gaussian process (GP) can be used to model a spatiotemporal traffic phenomenon over a road network as follows: The traffic phenomenon is defined to vary as a realization of a GP. Let V be a set of road segments representing the domain of the road network such that each road segment s ∈ V is specified by a p-dimensional vector of features and is associated with a realized (random) measurement zs (Zs) of the traffic condition such as speed if s is observed (unobserved). Let {Zs}s∈V denote a GP, that is, every finite subset of {Zs}s∈V follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). Then, the GP is fully specified by its prior mean µs , E[Zs] and covariance σss′ , cov[Zs, Zs′ ] for all s, s′ ∈ V . In particular, we will describe in Section 2.1 how the covariance σss′ for modeling the correlation of measurements between all pairs of segments s, s′ ∈ V can be designed to exploit the road segment features and the road network topology.\nA chief capability of the GP model is that of performing probabilistic regression: Given a set D ⊂ V of observed road segments and a column vector zD of corresponding measurements, the joint distribution of the measurements at any set Y ⊆ V \\ D of unobserved road segments remains Gaussian with the following posterior mean vector and covariance matrix\nµY |D , µY + ΣY DΣ −1 DD(zD − µD) (1)\nΣY Y |D , ΣY Y − ΣY DΣ−1DDΣDY (2)\nwhere µY (µD) is a column vector with mean components µs for all s ∈ Y (s ∈ D), ΣY D (ΣDD) is a covariance matrix with covariance components σss′ for all s ∈ Y, s′ ∈ D (s, s′ ∈ D), and ΣDY is the transpose of ΣY D. The posterior mean vector µY |D (1) is used to predict the measurements at any set Y of unobserved road segments. The posterior covariance matrix ΣY Y |D (2), which is independent of the measurements zD, can be processed in two ways to quantify the uncertainty of these predictions: (a) the trace of ΣY Y |D yields the sum of posterior variances Σss|D over all s ∈ Y ; (b) the determinant of ΣY Y |D is used in calculating the Gaussian posterior joint entropy\nH[ZY |ZD] , 1\n2 log(2πe) |Y | ∣∣ΣY Y |D∣∣ . (3) In contrast to the first measure of uncertainty that assumes conditional independence between measurements in the set Y of unobserved road segments, the entropy-based measure (3) accounts for their correlation, thereby not overestimating their uncertainty. Hence, we will focus on using the entropy-based measure of uncertainty in this paper."

      "text" : "If the observations are noisy (i.e., by assuming additive independent identically distributed Gaussian noise with variance σ2n), then their prior covariance σss′ can be expressed as σss′ = k(s, s′) + σ2nδss′ where δss′ is a Kronecker delta that is 1 if s = s′ and 0 otherwise, and k is a kernel function measuring the pairwise “similarity” of road segments. For a traffic phenomenon (e.g., road speeds), the correlation of measurements between pairs of road segments depends not only on their features (e.g., length, number of lanes, speed limit, direction) but also the road network topology. So, the kernel function is defined to exploit both the features and topology information, which will be described next.\nDefinition 1 (Road Network) Let the road network be represented as a weighted directed graph G , (V,E,m) that consists of\n• a set V of vertices denoting the domain of all possible road segments, • a set E ⊆ V × V of edges where there is an edge (s, s′) from s ∈ V to s′ ∈ V iff the end of segment s connects to the start of segment s′ in the road network, and • a weight function m : E → R+ measuring the standardized Manhattan distance (Borg and Groenen, 2005) m((s, s′)) , ∑p i=1 |[s]i − [s′]i|/ri of each edge (s, s′)\nwhere [s]i ([s′]i) is the i-th component of the feature vector specifying road segment s (s′), and ri is the range of the i-th feature. The weight function m serves as a dissimilarity measure between adjacent road segments.\nThe next step is to compute the shortest path distance d(s, s′) between all pairs of road segments s, s′ ∈ V (i.e., using Floyd-Warshall or Johnson’s algorithm) with respect to the topology of the weighted directed graph G. Such a distance function is again a measure of dissimilarity, rather than one of similarity, as required by a kernel function. Fur-\nthermore, a valid GP kernel needs to be positive semidefinite and symmetric (Schölkopf and Smola, 2002), which are clearly violated by d.\nTo construct a valid GP kernel from d, multi-dimensional scaling (Borg and Groenen, 2005) is applied to embed the domain of road segments into the p′-dimensional Euclidean space Rp′ . Specifically, a mapping g : V → Rp′ is determined by minimizing the squared loss g∗ = arg ming ∑ s,s′∈V (d(s, s\n′)−‖g(s)−g(s′)‖)2. With a small squared loss, the Euclidean distance ‖g∗(s) − g∗(s′)‖ between g∗(s) and g∗(s′) is expected to closely approximate the shortest path distance d(s, s′) between any pair of road segments s and s′. After embedding into Euclidean space, a conventional kernel function such as the squared exponential one (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) can be used:\nk(s, s′) = σ2s exp −1 2 p′∑ i=1 ( [g∗(s)]i − [g∗(s′)]i `i )2 where [g∗(s)]i ([g∗(s′)]i) is the i-th component of the p′dimensional vector g∗(s) (g∗(s′)), and the hyperparameters σs, `1, . . . , `p′ are, respectively, signal variance and lengthscales that can be learned using maximum likelihood estimation (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). The resulting kernel function k1 is guaranteed to be valid."

      "text" : "Although the GP is an effective predictive model, it faces a practical limitation of cubic time complexity in the number |D| of observations; this can be observed from computing the posterior distribution (i.e., (1) and (2)), which requires inverting covariance matrix ΣDD and incursO(|D|3) time. If |D| is expected to be large, GP prediction cannot be performed in real time. For practical usage, we have to resort to computationally cheaper approximate GP prediction.\nA simple method of approximation is to select only a subset U of the entire set D of observed road segments (i.e., U ⊂ D) to compute the posterior distribution of the measurements at any set Y ⊆ V \\ D of unobserved road segments. Such a subset of data (SoD) approximation method produces the following predictive Gaussian distribution, which closely resembles that of the full GP model (i.e., by simply replacing D in (1) and (2) with U ):\nµY |U = µY + ΣY UΣ −1 UU (zU − µU ) (4)\nΣY Y |U = ΣY Y − ΣY UΣ−1UUΣUY .

In practice, random subset selection often yields poor performance.

Then, all road segments in D \\ U are scored based on a criterion that can be chosen from, for example, the works of (Krause et al., 2008b; Lawrence et al., 2003; Seeger and Williams, 2003). The highest-scored segment is selected for inclusion in U and removed from D. This greedy selection procedure is iterated until U reaches a predefined size. Among the various criteria introduced earlier, the differential entropy score (Lawrence et al., 2003) is reported to perform well (Oh et al., 2010); it is a monotonic function of the posterior variance Σss|U (5), thus resulting in the greedy selection of a segment s ∈ D \\ U with the largest variance in each iteration."

      "text" : "In the previous section, two centralized data fusion approaches to exact (i.e., (1) and (2)) and approximate (i.e., (4) and (5)) GP prediction are introduced. In this section, we will discuss the decentralized data fusion component of our D2FAS algorithm, which distributes the computational load among the mobile sensors to achieve efficient and scalable approximate GP prediction.\nThe intuition of our decentralized data fusion algorithm is as follows: Each of theK mobile sensors constructs a local summary of the observations taken along its own path in the road network and communicates its local summary to every other sensor. Then, it assimilates the local summaries received from the other sensors into a globally consistent summary, which is exploited for predicting the traffic phenomenon as well as active sensing. This intuition will be formally realized and described in the paragraphs below.\nWhile exploring the road network, each mobile sensor summarizes its local observations taken along its path based on a common support set U ⊂ V known to all the other sensors. Its local summary is defined as follows:\nDefinition 2 (Local Summary) Given a common support set U ⊂ V known to all K mobile sensors, a set Dk ⊂ V of observed road segments and a column vector zDk of corresponding measurements local to mobile sensor k, its local summary is defined as a tuple (żkU , Σ̇ k UU ) where\nżkU , ΣUDkΣ −1 DkDk|U (zDk − µDk) (6)\nΣ̇kUU , ΣUDkΣ −1 DkDk|UΣDkU (7)\nsuch that ΣDkDk|U is defined in a similar manner to (5).\nRemark. Unlike SoD (Section 2.2), the support set U of road segments does not have to be observed, since the local summary (i.e., (6) and (7)) is independent of the corresponding measurements zU . So, U does not need to be a subset of D = ⋃K k=1Dk. To select an informative support set U from the set V of all possible segments in the road network, an offline active selection procedure similar to that in the last paragraph of Section 2.2 can be performed just once prior to observing data to determine U . In contrast, SoD has to perform online active selection every time new road segments are being observed.\nBy communicating its local summary to every other sensor, each mobile sensor can then construct a globally consistent summary from the received local summaries:\nDefinition 3 (Global Summary) Given a common support set U ⊂ V known to all K mobile sensors and the local summary (żkU , Σ̇ k UU ) of every mobile sensor k = 1, . . . ,K, the global summary is defined as a tuple (z̈U , Σ̈UU ) where\nz̈U , K∑ k=1 żkU (8)\nΣ̈UU , ΣUU + K∑ k=1 Σ̇kUU . (9)\nRemark. In this paper, we assume all-to-all communication between the K mobile sensors. Supposing this is not possible and each sensor can only communicate locally with its neighbors, the summation structure of the global summary (specifically, (8) and (9)) makes it amenable to be constructed using distributed consensus filters (OlfatiSaber, 2005). We omit these details since they are beyond the scope of this paper.\nFinally, the global summary is exploited by each mobile sensor to compute a globally consistent predictive Gaussian distribution, as detailed in Theorem 1A below, as well as to perform decentralized active sensing (Section 4):\nTheorem 1 Let a common support set U ⊂ V be known to all K mobile sensors. A. Given the global summary (z̈U , Σ̈UU ), each mo-\nbile sensor computes a globally consistent predictive Gaussian distribution N (µY ,ΣY Y ) of the measurements at any set Y of unobserved road segments where\nµY , µY + ΣY U Σ̈ −1 UU z̈U (10)\nΣY Y , ΣY Y − ΣY U (Σ−1UU − Σ̈ −1 UU )ΣUY . (11)\nB. Let N (µPITCY |D,Σ PITC Y Y |D) be the predictive Gaussian dis-\ntribution computed by the centralized sparse partially independent training conditional (PITC) approximation of GP model (Quiñonero-Candela and Rasmussen, 2005) where\nµPITCY |D , µY + ΓY D (ΓDD + Λ) −1 (zD − µD) (12)\nΣPITCY Y |D , ΣY Y − ΓY D (ΓDD + Λ) −1 ΓDY (13)\nsuch that ΓBB′ , ΣBUΣ −1 UUΣUB′ (14)\nand Λ is a block-diagonal matrix constructed from the K diagonal blocks of ΣDD|U , each of which is a matrix ΣDkDk|U for k = 1, . . . ,K where D =⋃K k=1Dk. Then, µY =µ PITC Y |D and ΣY Y =Σ PITC Y Y |D.\nThe proof of Theorem 1B is given in Appendix A. The equivalence result of Theorem 1B bears two implications:\nRemark 1. The computation of PITC can be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors in a Google-like\nMapReduce paradigm (Chu et al., 2007), thereby improving the time efficiency of prediction: Each of the K mappers (sensors) is tasked to compute its local summary while the reducer (any sensor) sums these local summaries into a global summary, which is then used to compute the predictive Gaussian distribution. Supposing |Y | ≤ |U | for simplicity, theO ( |D|((|D|/K)2 + |U |2) ) time incurred by\nPITC can be reduced to O ( (|D|/K)3 + |U |3 + |U |2K ) time of running our decentralized algorithm on each of the K sensors, the latter of which scales better with increasing number |D| of observations.\nRemark 2. We can draw insights from PITC to elucidate an underlying property of our decentralized algorithm: It is assumed that ZD1 , . . . , ZDK , ZY are conditionally independent given the measurements at the support set U of road segments. To potentially reduce the degree of violation of this assumption, an informative support set U is actively selected, as described earlier in this section. Furthermore, the experimental results on real-world urban road network data2 (Section 6) show that D2FAS can achieve predictive performance comparable to that of the full GP model while enjoying significantly lower computational cost, thus demonstrating the practicality of such an assumption for predicting traffic phenomena. The predictive performance of D2FAS can be improved by increasing the size of U at the expense of greater time and communication overhead."

In contrast, our decentralized data fusion algorithm (Section 3) only requires communicating local summaries (Definition 2) to compute (11) for solving the active sensing problem (15):\nw∗ = arg max w H[ZYw ] , (17)\nH[ZYw ] , 1\n2 log(2πe) |Yw| ∣∣ΣYwYw ∣∣ . (18) Without imposing any structural assumption, solving the active sensing problem (17) will be prohibitively expensive due to the space of possible joint walks w that grows exponentially in the number K of mobile sensors. To overcome this scalability issue for D2FAS, our key idea is to construct a block-diagonal matrix whose log-determinant closely approximates that of ΣYwYw (11) and exploit the property that the log-determinant of such a block-diagonal matrix can be decomposed into a sum of log-determinants of its diagonal blocks, each of which depends only on the walks of a disjoint subset of theK mobile sensors. Consequently, the active sensing problem can be partially decentralized, leading to a reduced space of possible joint walks to be searched, as detailed in the rest of this section.\nFirstly, we extend an earlier assumption in Section 3: ZD1 , . . . , ZDK , ZYw1 , . . . , ZYwK are conditionally independent given the measurements at the support set U of road segments. Then, it can be shown via the equivalence to PITC (Theorem 1B) that ΣYwYw (11) comprises diagonal blocks of the form ΣYwkYwk for k = 1, . . . ,K and off-diagonal blocks of the form ΣYwkU Σ̈ −1 UUΣUYwk′ for k, k′ = 1, . . . ,K and k 6= k′. In particular, each offdiagonal block of ΣYwYw represents the correlation of measurements between the unobserved road segments Ywk and Ywk′ along the respective walks wk of sensor k and wk′ of sensor k′. If the correlation between some pair of their possible walks is high enough, then their walks have to be coordinated. This is formally realized by the following coordination graph over the K sensors:\nDefinition 4 (Coordination Graph) Define the coordination graph to be an undirected graph G , (V, E) that comprises • a set V of vertices denoting the K mobile sensors, and • a set E of edges denoting coordination dependencies be-\ntween sensors such that there exists an edge {k, k′} incident with sensors k ∈ V and k′ ∈ V \\ {k} iff\nmax s∈YWk ,s′∈YWk′ ∣∣∣ΣsU Σ̈−1UUΣUs′ ∣∣∣ > ε (19) for a predefined constant ε > 0 whereWk denotes the set of possible walks of lengthL of mobile sensor k from origin sk in the road network G and YWk , ⋃ wk∈Wk Ywk .\nRemark. The construction of G can be decentralized as follows: Since Σ̈UU is symmetric and positive definite, it can be decomposed by Cholesky factorization into Σ̈UU = ΨΨ> where Ψ is a lower triangular matrix and Ψ> is the transpose of Ψ. Then, ΣsU Σ̈−1UUΣUs′ = (Ψ\\ΣUs)>Ψ\\ΣUs′ where Ψ\\B denotes the column vector φ solving Ψφ = B. That is, ΣsU Σ̈−1UUΣUs′ (19) can be expressed as a dot product of two vectors Ψ\\ΣUs and Ψ\\ΣUs′ ; this property is exploited to determine adjacency between sensors in a decentralized manner:\nDefinition 5 (Adjacency) Let Φk , {Ψ\\ΣUs}s∈YWk (20) for k = 1, . . . ,K. A sensor k ∈ V is adjacent to sensor k′ ∈ V \\ {k} in coordination graph G iff\nmax φ∈Φk,φ′∈Φk′ ∣∣φ>φ′∣∣ > ε . (21) It follows from the above definition that if each sensor k constructs Φk and exchanges it with every other sensor, then it can determine its adjacency to all the other sensors and store this information in a column vector ak of length K with its k′-th component being defined as follows:\n[ak]k′ = { 1 if sensor k is adjacent to sensor k′, 0 otherwise. (22)\nBy exchanging its adjacency vector ak with every other sensor, each sensor can construct a globally consistent adjacency matrix AG , (a1 . . . aK) to represent coordination graph G.\nNext, by computing the connected components (say, K of them) of coordination graph G, their resulting vertex sets partition the set V of K sensors into K disjoint subsets V1, . . . ,VK such that the sensors within each subset have to coordinate their walks. Each sensor can determine its residing connected component in a decentralized way by performing a depth-first search in G starting from it as root.\nFinally, construct a block-diagonal matrix Σ̂YwYw to comprise diagonal blocks of the form ΣYwVn YwVn for n = 1, . . . ,K where wVn , (wk)k∈Vn and YwVn ,⋃ k∈Vn Ywk . The active sensing problem (17) is then approximated by\nmax w\n1 2 log(2πe)\n|Yw| ∣∣∣Σ̂YwYw ∣∣∣\n≡ max (wV1 ,...,wVK ) K∑ n=1 log(2πe)|YwVn | ∣∣∣ΣYwVn YwVn ∣∣∣\n= K∑ n=1 max wVn log(2πe)|YwVn | ∣∣∣ΣYwVn YwVn ∣∣∣ ,\n(23)\nwhich can be solved in a partially decentralized manner by each disjoint subset Vn of mobile sensors: ŵVn = arg max\nwVn\nlog(2πe)|YwVn | ∣∣∣ΣYwVn YwVn ∣∣∣ . (24)\nOur active sensing algorithm becomes fully decentralized if ε is set to be sufficiently large: more sensors become isolated in G, consequently decreasing the size κ , max\nn |Vn|\nof its largest connected component to 1.

Recall from the data fusion component of D2FAS in Algorithm 1 that, in each iteration, each sensor broadcasts aO ( |U |2 ) -sized summary encapsulating its local observations, which is robust against communication failure. In contrast, FGP and SoD require each sensor to broadcast, in each iteration, a O(|D|/K)-sized message comprising exactly its local observations to handle communication failure. If the number of local observations grows to be larger in size than a local summary of predefined size, then the data fusion component of D2FAS is more scalable than FGP and SoD in terms of communication overhead. For the partially decentralized active sensing component of D2FAS, each sensor broadcasts O(∆L|U |)- sized Φk and O(K)-sized ak messages.\n6 Experiments and Discussion\n25\n37\n49\n61\n73\n85\n97 This section evaluates the predictive performance, time efficiency, and scalability of our D2FAS algorithm on a real-world traffic phenomenon (i.e., speeds (km/h) of road segments) over an urban\nroad network (top figure) in Tampines area, Singapore during evening peak hours on April 20, 2011. It comprises 775 road segments including highways, arterials, slip roads, etc. The mean speed is 48.8 km/h and the standard deviation is 20.5 km/h.\nThe performance of D2FAS is compared to that of centralized active sensing (17) coupled with the state-of-the-art data fusion methods: full GP (FGP) and SoD (Section 2). A network of K mobile sensors is tasked to explore the road network to gather a total of up to 960 observations. To reduce computational time, each sensor repeatedly computes and executes maximum-entropy walks of length L = 2 (instead of computing a very long walk), unless otherwise stated. For D2FAS and SoD, |U | is set to 64 . For the active sensing component of D2FAS, ε is set to 0.1, unless otherwise stated.

      "text" : "Predictive performance and time efficiency. Fig. 1 shows results of the performance of the tested algorithms averaged over 40 randomly generated starting sensor locations with varying number K = 4, 6, 8 of sensors. It can be observed that D2FAS is significantly more time-efficient and scales better with increasing number |D| of observations (Figs. 1d to 1f) while achieving predictive performance close to that of centralized active sensing coupled with FGP and SoD (Figs. 1a to 1c). Specifically, D2FAS is about 1, 2, 4 orders of magnitude faster than centralized active sensing coupled with FGP and SoD for K = 4, 6, 8 sensors, respectively.\nScalability of D2FAS. Using the same results as that in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 plots them differently to reveal the scalability of the tested algorithms with increasing number K of sen-\nsors. Additionally, we provide results of the performance of D2FAS for K = 10, 20, 30 sensors; such results are not available for centralized active sensing coupled with FGP and SoD due to extremely long incurred time. It can be observed from Figs. 2a to 2c that the predictive performance of all tested algorithms improve with a larger number of sensors because each sensor needs to execute fewer walks and its performance is therefore less adversely affected by its myopic selection (i.e., L = 2) of maximum-entropy walks. As a result, more informative unobserved road segments are explored.\nAs shown in Fig. 2d, when the randomly placed sensors gather their initial observations (i.e., |D| < 400), the time incurred by D2FAS is higher for greater K due to larger subsets of sensors being formed to coordinate their walks (i.e., larger κ). As more observations are gathered (i.e., |D| ≥ 400), its partially decentralized active sensing component directs the sensors to explore further apart from each other in order to maximize the entropy of their walks. This consequently decreases κ, leading to a reduction in incurred time. Furthermore, as K increases from 4 to 20, the incurred time decreases due to its decentralized data fusion component that can distribute the computational load\namong a greater number of sensors. When the road network becomes more crowded from K = 20 to K = 30 sensors, the incurred time increases slightly due to slightly larger κ. In contrast, Figs. 2e and 2f show that the time taken by FGP and SoD increases significantly primarily due to their centralized active sensing incurring exponential time in K. Hence, the scalability of our D2FAS algorithm in the number of sensors allows the deployment of a largerscale mobile sensor network (i.e.,K ≥ 10) to achieve more accurate traffic modeling and prediction (Figs. 2a to 2c).\nScalability of data fusion. Fig. 3 shows results of the scalability of the tested data fusion methods with increasing number K of sensors. In order to produce meaningful results for fair comparison, the same active sensing component has to be coupled with the data fusion methods and its incurred time kept to a minimum. As such, we impose the use of a fully decentralized active sensing component to be performed by each mobile sensor k: w∗k = arg maxwk H[ZYwk |ZD]. For D\n2FAS, this corresponds exactly to (24) by setting a large enough ε (in our experiments, ε = 2) to yield κ = 1; consequently, computational and communicational operations pertaining to the coordination graph can be omitted.\nIt can be seen from Fig. 3a that the time incurred by the decentralized data fusion component of D2FAS decreases with increasingK, as explained previously. In contrast, the time incurred by FGP and SoD increases (Fig. 3b and 3c): As discussed above, a larger number of sensors results in a greater quantity of more informative unique observations to be gathered (i.e., fewer repeated observations), which increases the time needed for data fusion. When K ≥ 10, D2FAS is at least 1 order of magnitude faster than FGP and SoD. It can also be observed that D2FAS scales better with increasing number of observations. So, the real-time performance and scalability of D2FAS’s decentralized data fusion enable it to be used for persistent large-scale traffic modeling and prediction where a large number of observations and sensors (including static and passive ones) are expected to be available.\nVarying length L of walk. Fig. 4 shows results of the performance of the tested algorithms with varying length L = 2, 4, 6, 8 of maximum-entropy joint walks; we choose to experiment with just 2 sensors since Figs. 2 and 3 reveal that a smaller number of sensors produce poorer predictive performance and higher incurred time with large number of\nobservations for D2FAS. It can be observed that the predictive performance of all tested algorithms improve with increasing walk length L because the selection of maximumentropy joint walks is less myopic. The time incurred by D2FAS increases due to larger κ but grows more slowly and is lower than that incurred by centralized active sensing coupled with FGP and SoD. Specifically, when L = 8, D2FAS is at least 1 order of magnitude faster (i.e., average of 60 s) than centralized active sensing coupled with SoD (i.e., average of > 732 s) and FGP (i.e., not available due to excessive incurred time). Also, notice from Figs. 2a and 2d that if a large number of sensors (i.e., K = 30) is available, D2FAS can select shorter walks of L = 2 to be significantly more time-efficient (i.e., average of > 3 orders of magnitude faster) while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of SoD with L = 8 and FGP with L = 6."

Analytical and empirical results have shown that our D2FAS algorithm is significantly more time-efficient and scales better with increasing number of observations and sensors while achieving predictive performance close to that of state-ofthe-art centralized active sensing coupled with FGP and SoD. Hence, D2FAS is practical for deployment in a largescale mobile sensor network to achieve persistent and accurate traffic modeling and prediction. For our future work, we will assume that each sensor can only communicate locally with its neighbors (instead of assuming all-to-all communication) and develop a distributed data fusion approach to efficient and scalable approximate GP prediction based on D2FAS and consensus filters (Olfati-Saber, 2005).\nAcknowledgments.
