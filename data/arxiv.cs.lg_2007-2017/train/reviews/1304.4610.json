Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension $n$ is assumed to be a mixture of $r$ complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the {\\em basis mismatch} issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem, we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of $\\mathcal{O}(r\\log^{2} n)$. We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 20:26:15 GMT  (212kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4610v1", "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013)"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 May 2013 00:29:31 GMT  (212kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4610v2", "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["yuxin chen", "yuejie chi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1304.4610"}
