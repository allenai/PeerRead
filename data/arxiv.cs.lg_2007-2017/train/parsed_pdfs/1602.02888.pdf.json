      "text" : "It’s clear that we collect and store larger amounts of data in databases. The need for efficiently and effectively analyzing and utilizing the information contained in the data has been increasing. Just as big data technologies evolved, the quantity and variety of data has also increased, and becoming more focused on storing every type of data. The main purpose of the storing of the data is intended to obtain information from data using a variety of machine learning methods. One of the primary machine learning techniques is classification, which labels the new samples based on a training set whose class labels are provided [1,2]. Classification methods are applied in various areas such as bioinformatics, pattern recognition, text mining, social network analysis, etc.\nIn Big Data age, traditional classifier algorithms have new challenges to scaling up in order to address the large-scale data set training. Most of existing classification algorithms assume that the data can fit in a memory in training phase of learning. These algorithms cannot be comfortably implemented to data sets that larger than computer memory capacity. Data partitioning strategy is one of the methods that can be applied to the training of high-dimensional data\nsets that are used for the building of classification model in order to overcome the input data complexity. In order to prevent the building of weak classification model that emerged from the data chunks, the input set needs to be strengthened through various methods.\nIn this study, the noise filtering approach is applied to each individual sub data set to clean noisy input data, then, AdaBoost ensemble method is used to strength the classification model at each data partition. We applied one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to filter noisy instances from each individual data partition and then AdaBoost ensemble based classification method is used to each individual data partition to increase the model accuracy.\nThe overall contributions of the study are listed as follows:\n1. Using data partitioning method, the complexity of input matrix, which is quite high for the single memory, is reduced in this manner. 2. Each individual sub-set of input matrix is reinforced with noise filtering method using one-class SVM and Gini impurity. 3. Each sub-set of input matrix is used in the training phase of the different ensemble classifier, so that each instances are considered when building a global classification model.\nGini impurity is used to calculate the uncertainty about source of input data set. This measure is applied to estimate the degree of information diversity provided by cleaned partition of sub data set.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly explains the methods that are used in this work. Section 3 describes the proposed data cleaning and partitioning method. Section 4 gives the experimental results. In Section 5, we give conclusion and future works."

      "text" : "SVM [3] method is used to find classification models using the maximum margin separating hyper plane. Schölkopf et al. [4] proposed a training methodology that handles only one class classification called as ”one-class” classification.\nOne-class SVM algorithm is a method used to detect the outliers in the data. Basically the method finds soft boundaries of the data set, and then, model determines whether new instance belongs to this data set or not. Suppose, we are given a data set, x1, . . .xm ∈ X drawn from an unknown underlying probability distribution P . We are interested in estimating a set S such that the probability that a test point from P lies inside in S with an a priori specified probability\nvalue. As shown in Figure 1, origin is labeled as −1, and the all training instances are labeled as +1.\nLet S = {(xi, yi)|xi ∈ IR n, y ∈ {1, . . . ,K}}mi=1 be input instances in IR n, φ : X → H be a kernel function that maps the input instances to another space. Then standard SVM method tries to find a hyper plane that solves the separation problem with an optimization problem. The objective function of the SVM classifier is formulated as follows.\nminw,ξ,ρ\n(\n1 2 ||w||2 + 1 mC ∑\ni\nξi − ρ\n)\nsubject to\n(w.φ(xi)) ≥ ρ− ξi\nξi ≥ 0, ∀i = 1, . . . ,m\n(1)\nwherew is orthogonal to the separating hyper plane, C is smoothness parameter, xi is the i-th input instances, m is the total number of input instances, ξi are the slack variables, ρ is the distance between origin and separating hyper plane.\nBy using Lagrange techniques, w and ρ are obtained, then the decision function becomes:\nf(x) = sign ((w.φ(x)) − ρ) (2)"

First reason is the diversity that means uncorrelated base classifiers [8,9]. Another reason is the reducing the input complexity of large-scale data sets [10]. Last one is to build classifier models for the specific part of the input instances [11].\nData partitioning is basically divided into two different groups; filter based data partitioning and wrapper based data partitioning [12]. In wrapper based data partitioning, sub-data sets are created using base classifier outputs [13]. In filter based data partitioning, sub-data sets are created before individual classifiers are trained [14]."

The single model at every sub-data set, m, is defined as follows:\nH(m)(x) = argmax k\nM ∑\nt=1\nαtht(x) (4)\nThe selected ensemble classifier models from last phase of our algorithm are combined into one single classification model, Ĥ(x), using accuracy based majority voting method.\nĤ(x) = argmax k\nm ∑\ni=1\nβH(m)(x) (5)\nwhere β is the accuracy of ensemble classifier."

      "text" : "In this section, we show the impact of noise removal pre-processing on the sample data sets. In order to show the noise removing affects, we used the ”Gini Impurity” to measure the quality of procedure. Gini approaches deal appropriately with data diversity of a data. The Gini measures the class distribution of variable y = {y1, · · · , ym}. The Gini impurity can be written as :\ng = 1− ∑\nk\np2j (6)\nwhere pj is the probability of class k, in data set D.\nThe cleaning results are shown in Figure 3a and Figure 3b. As expected, the Gini impurity value decreases with the cleaning of the noisy instances from the data, and increases on separated noisy data. Our aim is to minimizing the Gini impurity on clean data set, Xclean, and maximizing the value on noisy data set\nXnoisy . As a result, this division ratio which minimizes the ratio between the two values was regarded as the optimum value.\nSplit Percantage = argmin p\nGini(Xclean, p) Gini(Xnoisy, p) (7)\nTable 2 shows the best Gini impurity performances of each data set used in our experiments."

Then we perform classification on test data sets, and calculate the accuracy of classifiers. We repeated the experiments 50 times, and average accuracy is calculated. Table 3 shows the average accuracy of each example data sets with and without noise removing using one-class SVMmethod.\nAs can be seen on Table 3, the noise removing based partitioned proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the splitted classifier building in most cases."

We carried out a series of computer experiments to find a global ensemble\nclassifier and the performance of our proposed method. The training process of a partitioned data set is simple, fast and final classifier model handle overall training instances. Our experimental results show that the memory requirement of training phase reduced remarkably, and the accuracy increased by using the noise removal process. The proposed method is a practical multiple ensemble classifier training model to classify large-scale data sets.\nIn the future work, our plan is to study different noise removing methods to clean sub data set. We plan adaptive noise removing ratio to make our method as autonomous as possible."
