      "text" : "Keyphrases are words and phrases that give a synoptic picture of what is important within a document. They are useful in many tasks such as document indexing (Gutwin et al., 1999), text categorization (Hulth and Megyesi, 2006) or summarization (Litvak and Last, 2008). However, most documents do not provide keyphrases, and the daily flow of new documents makes the manual keyphrase annotation impractical. As a consequence, automatic keyphrase annotation has received special attention in the NLP community and many methods have been proposed (Hasan and Ng, 2014).\nThe task of automatic keyphrase annotation consists in identifying the main concepts, or topics, addressed in a document. Such task is crucial to access relevant scientific documents that could be useful for researchers. Keyphrase annotation methods fall into two broad categories: keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment methods. Keyphrase extraction methods extract the most important words or phrases occurring in a document, while assignment methods provide controlled keyphrases from a domain-specific terminology (controlled vocabulary).\nThe automatic keyphrase annotation task is often reduced to the sole keyphrase extraction task. Unlike assignment methods, extraction methods do not require domain specific controlled vocabularies that are costly to create and to maintain. Furthermore, they are able to identify new concepts that have not been yet recorded in the thesaurus or ontologies. However, extraction methods often output ill-formed or inappropriate keyphrases (Medelyan and Witten, 2008), and they produce only keyphrases that actually occur in the document.\nObservations made on manually assigned keyphrases from scientific papers of specialized domains show that professional human indexers both extract keyphrases from the content of the document and assign keyphrases based on their knowledge of the domain (Liu et al., 2011). Here, we propose an approach that mimics this behaviour and jointly extracts and assigns keyphrases. We use two graph representations, one for the document and one for the specialized domain. Then, we apply a co-ranking algorithm to perform both keyphrase extraction and assignment in a mutually reinforcing manner. We perform\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

Along with this approach come two contributions. First, we present a simple yet efficient assignment extension of a state-of-the-art graph-based keyphrase extraction method, TopicRank (Bougouin et al., 2013). Second, we circumvent the need for a controlled vocabulary by leveraging reference keyphrases from training data and further take advantage of their relationship within the training data."

      "heading" : "2.1 Keyphrase extraction",
      "text" : "Keyphrase extraction is the most common approach to tackle the automatic keyphrase annotation task. Previous work includes many approaches (Hasan and Ng, 2014), from statistical ranking (Salton et al., 1975) to binary classification (Witten et al., 1999), through graph-based ranking (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004) of keyphrase candidates. As our approach uses graph-based ranking, we focus on the latter. For a detailed overview of keyphrase extraction methods, refer to (Hasan and Ng, 2010; Hasan and Ng, 2014).\nSince the seminal work of Mihalcea and Tarau (2004), graph-based ranking approaches to keyphrase extraction are becoming increasingly popular. The original idea behind these approaches is to build a graph from the document and rank its nodes according to their importance using centrality measures.\nIn TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), the input document is represented as a co-occurrence graph in which nodes are words. Two words are connected by an edge if they co-occur in a fixed-sized window of words. A random walk algorithm is used to iteratively rank the words, then extract the keyphrases by concatenating the most important words.\nThe random walk algorithm simulates the “voting concept”, or recommendation: a node is important if it is connected to many other nodes, and if many of those are important. Thus, let G “ pV,Eq be an undirected graph with a set of vertices V and a set of edges E, and let Epviq be the set of nodes connected to the node vi. The score Spviq of a vertex vi is initialized to 1 and computed iteratively until convergence using the following equation:\nSpviq “ p1´ λq ` λ ÿ\nvjPEpviq\nSpvjq\n|Epvjq| (1)\nwhere λ is a damping factor that has been set to 0.85 by Brin and Page (1998) for a trade-off between ranking accuracy and fast convergence.\nFollowing up the work of Mihalcea and Tarau (2004), Wan and Xiao (2008) added edge weights (cooccurrence numbers) to the random walk and further improved the graph with co-occurrence information borrowed from similar documents. To extract keyphrases from a document, they first look for five similar documents, then use them to add new edges between words within the graph and reinforce the weight of existing edges. Liu et al. (2010) biased multiple graphs with topic probabilities drawn from LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) (Blei et al., 2003), to rank the words regarding each graph and to merge the rankings together. This method performs as many rankings as the number of topics and gives higher importance scores to high-ranking words for as many topics as possible. By doing so, Liu et al. (2010) increase the topic coverage provided by the extracted keyphrases.\nMost recently, Zhang et al. (2013) and Bougouin et al. (2013) explored further the value of topics for keyphrase extraction. Zhang et al. (2013) used graph co-ranking to improve the method of Liu et al. (2010) by introducing LDA topics right inside the graph. Bougouin et al. (2013) proposed to represent topics as clusters of similar keyphrase candidates within the document (i.e. words and phrases from the document), to rank these topics instead of the words and to extract the most representative candidate as keyphrase for each important topic. As our work extends that of Bougouin et al. (2013), we present a detailed description of their method in Section 3.1."

      "heading" : "2.2 Keyphrase assignment",
      "text" : "Keyphrase assignment provides keyphrases for every document of a specific domain using a controlled vocabulary. Dissimilar to keyphrase extraction, keyphrase assignment also aims to provide keyphrases that do not occur within the document. This task is more difficult than keyphrase extraction and has, therefore, seldom been employed for automatic keyphrase annotation. The state-of-the art method for keyphrase assignment is KEA++ (Medelyan and Witten, 2006).\nKEA++ uses a domain-specific thesaurus to assign keyphrases to a document. First, keyphrase candidates are selected among the n-grams of the document. N-grams that do not match a thesaurus entry are either removed or substituted by a synonym that matches a thesaurus entry. This candidate selection approach induces a limitation of keyphrase assignment, refered to as keyphrase indexing by Medelyan and Witten (2006), because it only assigns keyphrases if they occur within the document. Second, KEA++ exploits the semantic relationships between keyphrase candidates within the thesaurus as the main feature of a Naive Bayes classifier. Compared to similar methods without domain specific resources, KEA++ achieves better performance. However, such resources are not readily available for most domains, and if so, they could be quickly out of date. The application scenario of KEA++ are thus restricted.\nOur proposition is to model with graphs both keyphrase extraction and assignment and to take benefit of this unified modelling to perform accurate keyphrase annotation."

Following previous work (Hasan and Ng, 2010; Wan and Xiao, 2008), keyphrase candidates are selected from the sequences of adjacent nouns and adjectives that occur within the document (/(N|A)+/).\n2. Topical clustering. Similar keyphrase candidates c are clustered into topics based on the words they share. Bougouin et al. (2013) use a Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) with a stem overlap similarity (see equation 2) and an average linkage. At the beginning, each keyphrase candidate is a single cluster, then candidates sharing an average of 1{4 stemmed words with the candidates of another cluster are iteratively added to the latter.\nsimpci, cjq “ |stemspciq X stemspcjq| |stemspciq Y stemspcjq|\n(2)\nwhere stemspciq is the set of stemmed words of the keyphrase candidate ci.\n3.

Keyphrase selection. One keyphrase candidate is selected from each of the N most important topics: the first occurring keyphrase candidate.\nOur work extends TopicRank to assign domain-specific keyphrases that do not necessarily occur within the document. First, we add a second graph representing the domain and unify it to the topic graph. Second, we define a co-ranking scheme that leverages the new graph. Finally, we redefine the keyphrase selection step for both extracting and assigning keyphrases."

      "heading" : "3.2 Unified graph construction",
      "text" : "TopicCoRank operates over a unified graph that connects two graphs representing the document topics, the controlled keyphrases and the relations between them (see Fig. 1). The controlled keyphrases are the keyphrases that were manually assigned to training documents. Considering the manually assigned keyphrases as the controlled vocabulary circumvents the need for a manually produced controlled vocabulary and also allows us to further take advantage of the semantic relatonship between the domainspecific (controlled) keyphrases. Because controlled keyphrases are presumably non-redundant, we do not topically cluster them as we do for keyphrase candidates.\nLet G “ pV “ T Y K,E “ Ein Y Eoutq denote the unified graph. Topics T “ tt1, t2, ..., tnu and controlled keyphrases K “ tk1, k2, ..., kmu are vertices V connected to their fellows by edges Ein Ď T ˆ T YK ˆK and connected to the other vertices by edges Eout Ď K ˆ T (see Fig. 1).\nTo unify the two graphs, we consider the controlled keyphrases as a category map and connect the document to its potential categories. We create an unweighted edge xki, tjy P Eout to connect a controlled keyphrase ki and a topic tj if the controlled keyphrase is a member of the topic, i.e. a keyphrase candidate of the topic2. We create an edge xti, tjy P Ein or xki, kjy P Ein between two topics ti and tj or two controlled keyphrases ki and kj when they co-occur within a sentence of the document or as keyphrases of a training document, respectively. Edges xti, tjy P Ein are weighted by the number of times (wi,j) topics ti and tj occur in the same sentence within the document. Edges xki, kjy P Ein are weighted by the number of times (wi,j) keyphrases ki and kj are associated to the same document among the training documents. Doing so, the weighting scheme of edges Ein is equivalent for both topics and controlled keyphrases. This equivalence is essential to ensure that not only controlled keyphrases occurring in the document can be assigned by properly co-ranking topics and controlled keyphrases.\n2To accept inflexions, such as plural inflexions, we follow Bougouin et al.

The inner recommendation Rin comes from nodes of the same graph (see equation 8). A topic or a controlled keyphrase is important if it is strongly connected to other topics or controlled keyphrases, respectively.\nThe outer recommendation influences the ranking of topics by controlled keyphrases and of controlled keyphrases by topics.

The bibliographic records contain a title of one scientific paper, its abstract and its keyphrases that were annotated by professional indexers (one per bibliographic record). Indexers were given the instruction to assign reference keyphrases from a controlled vocabulary and to extract new concepts or very specific keyphrases from the titles and the abstracts. Each dataset is divided into three sets: a test set, used for evaluation; a training set (denoted as train), used to represent the domain; and a development set (denoted as dev), used for parameter tuning.\nThe amount of missing keyphrases, i.e. keyphrases that cannot be extracted from the documents, shows the importance of keyphrase assignment in the context of scientific domains.

The first reason for this observation is that KEA++ is restricted to thesauri entries while most keyphrases are missing within our documents. The second reason is that KEA++ relies on rich thesauri that contain an important amount of semantic relations between the entries, while our (real application) thesauri have a modest amount of semantic relations between the entries.\nOverall, using graph co-ranking significantly outperforms TopicRank and KEA++. Comparing TopicRank to TopicCoRankextr shows the positive influence of the domain (controlled keyphrases) on the ranking of the topics.

Such representation gives a good appreciation of the advantage of a method compared to others, especially if the other methods achieve performances in the Area Under the Curve (AUC).\nFigure 2 shows the precision/recall curves of TopicRank, KEA++ and TopicCoRank on each dataset. The final recall for the methods does not reach 100% because the candidate selection method does not provide keyphrases that do not occur within the document, as well as candidates that do not fit the POS tag pattern /(N|A)+/. Also, because TopicRank and TopicCoRank topically cluster keyphrase candidates\nand output only one candidate per topic, their final recall is lowered every time a wrong keyphrase is chosen over a correct one from the topic.\nWe observe that the curve for TopicCoRank is systematically above the others, thus showing improvements in the area under the curve and not just in point estimate such as f1-score.

When λt “ 1, the domain does not influence the ranking and the performance of TopicCoRankextr is in the range of TopicRank’s performance. Overall, the performance curve of TopicCoRankextr decreases while λt increases. Thus, the experiment demonstrates that the domain has a positive influence on the keyphrase extraction.\nFig. 4 shows the behavior of TopicCoRankassign when λk varies from 0 to 1. When λk “ 0, only the document influences the ranking of the controlled keyphrases. As for TopicCoRankextr when λt “ 0, TopicCoRankassign is slightly similar to KEA++ when λk “ 0. When λk “ 1, TopicCoRankassign always outputs the same keyphrases: the ones that are the most important in the domain.

Some keyphrases, such as “French”, are frequently assigned because they are part of most of the bibliographic records of our dataset7 (48.9% of the Linguistics records contain “French” as a keyphrase); Other keyphrases, such as “semantic interpretation”, are assigned thanks to their strong connection with controlled keyphrases occurring in the abstract (e.g. “lexical semantics”).\nInterestingly, the performance of TopicCoRank is not only better thanks to the assignment.

Keyphrase candidate selection. Following previous work (Hasan and Ng, 2010; Wan and Xiao, 2008), keyphrase candidates are selected from the sequences of adjacent nouns and adjectives that occur within the document (/(N|A)+/). 2. Topical clustering. Similar keyphrase candidates c are clustered into topics based on the words they share. Bougouin et al.

Keyphrase annotation is either carried out by extracting the most important phrases from a document, keyphrase extraction, or by assigning entries from a controlled domain-specific vocabulary, keyphrase assignment. Assignment methods are generally more reliable. They provide better-formed keyphrases, as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document. But they are often silent on the contrary of extraction methods that do not depend on manually built resources. This paper proposes a new method to perform both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment in an integrated and mutual reinforcing manner. Experiments have been carried out on datasets covering different domains of humanities and social sciences. They show statistically significant improvements compared to both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment state-of-the art methods.",
