      "text" : "The task of SRL is to recognize arguments of a given predicate in a sentence and assign semantic role labels. Since SRL can give a lot of semantic information, and can help in sentence understanding, a lot of NLP works such as machine translation(Xiong et al., 2012; Aziz et al., 2011) use SRL information. Figure 1 shows an example of SRL task from Chinese Proposition Bank 1.0(CPB 1.0)(Xue and Palmer, 2003).\nTraditional methods on SRL use statistical classifiers such as CRF, MaxEntropy and SVM (Sun and Jurafsky, 2004; Xue, 2008; Ding and Chang, 2008, 2009; Sun, 2010) to do classification according to manually designed features.\nRecent works based on recurrent neural network (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Zhou and Xu, 2015; Wang et al., 2015) extract features automatically, and outperform traditional methods significantly. However, RNN methods treat language as sequence data, so most of them fail to take tree structured parsing information into account, which\nis considered important for SRL task (Xue, 2008; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Pradhan et al., 2005). Even though there are some RNN based works trying to utilize parsing information, they still do it in a feature-engineering way.\nWe propose Syntax Aware LSTM (SA-LSTM) to directly model complex dependency parsing information in an architecture engineering way instead of feature engineering way. For example, in Figure 1, the arrowed line stands for dependency relationship, which is rich in syntactic information. Our SA-LSTM architecture is shown in Figure 2. Compares to ordinary LSTM, We add additional connections between dependency related words to capture and model such rich syntactic information in architecture engineering way. Also, to take dependency relationship type into account, we also introduce trainable weights for different types of dependency relationship. The weights can be trained to indicate importance of a dependency type.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that SA-LSTM utilizes parsing information better than traditional feature engineering way. Furthermore, SA-LSTM reaches 79.64%F1 score on CPB 1.0, outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly based on Student’s t-test(p < 0.05)."

Note\nthat, α ∈ {0, 1} indicates whether there is a dependency relationship between wi and wt, only dependency related hi can be input into current cell.\nWe add a gate gs to constrain information from St, as shown in Equation 8. To protect the original sentence information from being diluted(Wu et al., 2016) by St, we add St to hidden layer vector ht instead of adding to cell state Ct, as shown in Equation 9:\ngs = σ(Wszt + Usht−1 + bs) (8)\nSo ht in our SA-LSTM cell is calculated as:\nht = go f(Ct) + gs St (9)\nSA-LSTM changes structure by adding different connections according to dependency parsing information. In this way, we consider the whole structure of dependency tree into SA-LSTM in an architecture engineering way.\nHowever, by using α in Equation 7, we do not take dependency type into account, so we further improve the way α is calculated from Equation 7 to Equation 10. Each typem of dependency relationship is assigned a trainable weight αm. In this way SA-LSTM can model differences between types of dependency relationship.\nα =  αm If there exists typem dependency\nrelationship between wi and wt 0 Otherwise\n(10)"

Pre-trained1 word embeddings are tested on SA-LSTM and shows improvement.\nWe use Stanford Parser(Chen and Manning, 2014) to get dependency parsing information, which now supports Universal Dependency representation in Chinese. Note that the train set of the parser overlaps a part of our test set, so we retrained the parser to avoid overlap.\nDimension of our hyper parameters are tuned according to development set and are shown in Table 1.2"

In this way, we model dependency parsing information in a conventional feature engineering way. After that, we feed these new feature representation into ordinary bi-LSTM.\nAs shown in Table 2, SA-LSTM reaches 79.56%F1 score with random initialization and 79.64%F1 score with pre-traind word embedding on CPB1.0 dataset. Both of them are the best F1 score ever published on CPB 1.0 dataset.\nWang et al. (2015) used bi-LSTM without parsing information and got 77.09%F1 score. “comparison feature engineering method” based on his work reaches 77.75F1 score. This demonstrates the introduction of dependency parsing information has impact on SRL job.\nCompared with the “comparison feature engineering method” shown in table 2, it is clear that SA-LSTM gain more improvement(77.75% to 79.56%) from the architecture of SA-LSTM than from the introduction of extra dependency parsing information(77.09% to 77.75%). Indeed, it is difficult to introduce the whole tree structure into the model using the simple feature engineering way. By building the dependency relationship directly into the structure of SA-LSTM and changing the way information flows, SA-LSTM is able to consider whole tree structure of dependency parsing information."

      "text" : "According to Equation 10, influence from a single type of dependency relationship will be multiplied with type weight αm. When αm is 0, the influence from this type of dependency relationship will be ignored totally. When the weight is bigger, the type of dependency relationship will have more influence on the whole system.\nAs shown in Figure 4, dependency relationship type dobj receives the highest weight after training, as shown by the red bar. According to grammar knowledge, dobj should be an informative relationship for SRL task, and our system give dobj the most influence automatically. This example further demonstrate that the result of SA-LSTM is highly in accordance with grammar knowledge, which further validates SA-LSTM."

      "text" : "Semantic role labeling (SRL) was first defined by (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002). Early works(Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Sun and Jurafsky, 2004) on SRL got promising result without large annotated SRL corpus. Xue and Palmer built the Chinese Proposition Bank(Xue and Palmer, 2003) to standardize Chinese SRL research.\nTraditional works such as (Xue and Palmer, 2005; Xue, 2008; Ding and Chang, 2009; Sun et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2014) use feature engineering methods. Traditional methods can take parsing information into account in feature engineering way, such as syntactic path feature. However, they suffer from heavy manually feature design workload, and data sparsity problem.\nMore recent SRL works often use neural network based methods. Collobert and Weston (2008) proposed a convolutional neural network method for SRL. Zhou and Xu (2015) proposed bidirectional RNN-LSTM method for English SRL, and Wang et al. (2015) proposed a bi-RNN-\nLSTM method for Chinese SRL on which our method is based. NN based methods extract features automatically and significantly outperforms traditional methods. However, most NN based methods can not utilize parsing information which is considered important for semantic related NLP tasks (Xue, 2008; Punyakanok et al., 2008; Pradhan et al., 2005).\nThe work of Roth and Lapata (2016) and Sha et al. (2016) have the same motivation as ours, but in feature engineering way. Roth and Lapata (2016) embed dependency parsing path into feature representations using LSTM. Sha et al. (2016) use dependency parsing information as feature to do argument relationships classification. In contrast, LA-LSTM utilizes parsing information in an architecture engineering way, by absorbing the parsing tree structure into SA-LSTM structure."

In this paper, we propose Syntax Aware Long Short Time Memory(SALSTM). The structure of SA-LSTM modifies according to dependency parsing information in order to model parsing information directly in an architecture engineering way instead of feature engineering way. We experimentally demonstrate that SA-LSTM gains more improvement from the model architecture. Furthermore, SALSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art on CPB 1.0 significantly according to Student t-test (p < 0.05).",
