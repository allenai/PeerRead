      "text" : "Transition-based constituent parsers are fast and accurate, performing incremental parsing using a sequence of state transitions in linear time. Pioneering models rely on a classifier to make local decisions, searching greedily for local transitions to build a parse tree (Sagae and Lavie, 2005). Zhu et al. (2013) use a beam search framework, which preserves linear time complexity of greedy search, while alleviating the disadvantage of error propagation. The model gives state-of-the-art accuracies at a speed of 89 sentences per second on the standard WSJ benchmark (Marcus et al., 1993).\nZhu et al. (2013) exploit rich features by extracting history information from a parser stack, which spans over non-local constituents. However, due to the incremental nature of shift-reduce parsing, the right-hand side constituents of the current word cannot be used to guide the action at each step. Such lookahead features (Tsuruoka et al., 2011) correspond to the outside scores in chart parsing (Goodman, 1998). It has been shown highly effective for obtaining improved accuracies.\nTo leverage such information for improving shiftreduce parsing, we propose a novel neural model to predict the constituent hierarchy related to each word before parsing. Our idea is inspired by the work of Roark and Hollingshead (2009) and Zhang et al. (2010b), which shows that shallow syntactic information gathered over the word sequence can be utilized for improving chart parsing speed without losing accuracies. For example, Roark and Hollingshead (2009) predict constituent boundary information on words as a pre-processing step, and use such information to prune the chart. Since such information is much lighter-weight compared to full parsing, it can be predicted relatively accurately using sequence labellers.\nDifferent from that of Roark and Hollingshead (2009), we collect lookahead constituent information for shift-reduce parsing, rather than pruning information for chart parsing. In addition, our concern is in the accuracies rather than the speed. Accordingly, our model should predict the constituent hierarchy on each word rather than simple boundary information. For example, in Figure 1(a), the constituent hierarchy that the word “The” starts is “S → NP”, and the constituent hierarchy that the word “table” ends is “S→ VP→ NP→ PP→ NP”. For\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n00 56\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nD ec\n2 01\neach word, we predict both the constituent hierarchy it starts and the constituent hierarchy it ends, using them as lookahead features.\nThe task is challenging in three aspects. First, it is significantly more difficult compared to simple sequence labelling, since two sequences of constituent hierarchies must be predicted for each word in the input sequence. Second, for high accuracies, global features from the full sentence are necessary since constituent hierarchies contain rich structural information. Third, to retain high speed for shift-reduce parsing, lookahead feature prediction must be executed efficiently. It is highly difficult to build such a model using manual discrete features and structured search.\nFortunately, sequential recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are remarkably effective models to encode the full input sentence. We leverage RNNs for building our constituent hierarchy predictor. In particular, a LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is used to learn global features automatically from the input words. For each word, a second LSTM is then used to generate the constituent hierarchies greedily using features from the hidden layer of the first LSTM, in the same way as a neural language model decoder generating output sentences for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014). The resulting model solves all the three challenges raised above. For fully-supervised learning, we learn word embeddings as a part of the model parameters.\nIn the standard WSJ (Marcus et al., 1993) and CTB 5.1 tests (Xue et al., 2005), our parser gives 1.3 F1 and 2.3 F1 improvement, respectively, over the\nbaseline of Zhu et al. (2013), resulting in a accuracy of 91.7 F1 for English and 85.5 F1 for Chinese, which are the best for fully-supervised models in the literature. We release our code, based on ZPar, at https://github.com/SUTDNLP/LookAheadConparser."

      "text" : "Shift-reduce parsers process an input sentence incrementally from left to right. A stack is used to maintain partial phrase-structures, while the incoming words are ordered in a buffer. At each step, a transition action is applied to consume an input word or construct a new phrase-structure. The set of transition actions are\n• SHIFT: pop the front word off the buffer, and push it onto the stack.\n• REDUCE-L/R-X: pop the top two constituents off the stack, combine them into a new constituent with label X, and push the new constituent onto the stack.\n• UNARY-X: pop the top constituent off the stack, raise it to a new constituent X, and push the new constituent onto the stack.\n• FINISH: pop the root node off the stack and end parsing.\n• IDLE: no-effect action on a completed state without changing items on the stack or buffer.\nThe deduction system for the process is shown in Figure 2, where a state is represented as [stack, buffer front index, completion mark, action index], and n is the number of words in the input. For example, given the sentence “They like apples”, the action sequence “SHIFT, SHIFT, SHIFT, REDUCEL-VP, REDUCE-R-S” gives its syntax “(S They (VP like apples) )”."

Second, they do not consider lookahead information beyond s3, or the syntactic structure of the buffer and sequence. We use a LSTM to capture full sentential information in linear time, representing such global information into the baseline parser as a constituent hierarchy for each word. Lookahead features are extracted from the constituent hierarchy to provide top-down guidance for bottom-up parsing."

      "heading" : "3.1 Constituent Hierarchy",
      "text" : "In a constituency tree, each word can start or end a constituent hierarchy. As shown in Figure 1, the word “The” starts a constituent hierarchy “S→ NP”. In particular, it starts a constituent S in the top level\nand then a following constituent NP. The word “table” ends a constituent hierarchy “S→ VP→ NP→ PP → NP”. In particular, it ends a constituent S in the top level, and then a VP (starting from the word “like”), an NP (starting from the noun phrase “this book”), a PP (starting from the word “in”), and finally an NP (starting from the word “the”). The extraction of constituent hierarchies for each word is based on unbinarized grammars, reflecting the start and end in unbinarized trees. The constituent hierarchy is empty (denoted as φ) if the corresponding words does not start or end a constituent. The constituent hierarchies are added into the shift-reduce parser as soft features (section 3.2).\nFormally, a constituent hierarchy is defined as\n[type : c1 → c2 → ...→ cz],\nwhere c is a constituent label (e.g. NP), “→” represents the top-down hierarchy, and type can be s or e, denoting that the current word starts or ends the constituent hierarchy, respectively, as shown in Figure 1. Compared with full parsing, the constituent hierarchies associated with each word have no forced structural dependencies between each other, and therefore can be modelled more easily, for each word individually. Serving as soft lookahead features rather than hard constraints, their interdependencies are not crucial for the main parser."

      "heading" : "3.2 Lookahead Features",
      "text" : "The lookahead feature templates are defined in Table 2. In order to ensure parsing efficiency, only simple feature templates are taken into consideration. The lookahead features of a state are instantiated for the top two items on the stack (i.e. s0 and s1) and buffer (i.e. q0 and q1). The new function Φ′ is defined to output the lookahead features vector. The score of a state in our model is simple extended form the Formula (1):\nC(α) = N∑ i=1 Φ(αi) · ~θ + Φ′(αi) · ~θ′\nFor each word, the lookahead feature represents the next level constituent in the top-down hierarchy, which can guide bottom-up parsing.\nFor example, Figure 3 shows two intermediate states during parsing. In Figure 3(a), the s-type and e-type lookahead features of s1 (i.e. the word “The”) are extracted from the constituent hierarchy in the bottom level, namely NP and NULL, respectively. On the other hand, in Figure 3(b), The s-type lookahead feature of s1 is extracted from the s-type constituent hierarchy of same word “The”, but is S based on current hierarchical level. The e-type lookahead feature, on the other hand, is extracted from the etype constituent hierarchy of end word “students” of the VP constituent, which is NULL in the next level. Lookahead features for items on the buffer are extracted in the same way.\nThe lookahead features are useful for guiding shift-reduce decisions given the current state. For example, given the intermediate state in Figure 3(a), s0 has a s-type lookahead feature ADJP, and q1 in the buffer has e-type lookahead feature ADJP. This indicates that the two items are likely reduced into the same constituent. Further, s0 cannot end a constituent because of the empty e-type constituent hierarchy. As a result, the final shift-reduce parser will assign more possibility to SHIFT decision."

Inspired by the encoder-decoder framework for neural machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), we use a\nLSTM to capture full sentence features, and another LSTM to generate the constituent hierarchies for each word. Compared with a CRF-based sequence labelling model (Roark and Hollingshead, 2009), the proposed model has three advantages. First, the global features can be automatically represented. Second, it can avoid the exponentially large number of labels if constituent hierarchies are treated as unique labels. Third, the model size is relatively small, and does not have a large effect on the final parser model.\nAs shown in Figure 4, the neural network consists of three main layers, namely the input layer, the encoder layer and the decoder layer. The input layer represents each word using its characters and token information; the encoder hidden layer uses a bidirectional recurrent neural network structure to learn global features from the sentence; and the decoder layer predicts constituent hierarchies according to the encoder layer features, by using attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014) to softly compute the contribution of each hidden unit of the encoder."

      "text" : "Our lookahead features are similar in spirit to the pruners of Roark and Hollingshead (2009) and Zhang et al. (2010b), which infer the maximum length of constituents that a particular word can start or end. However, our method is different in three main perspectives. First, rather than using a CRF with sparse local word window features, a neural network is used for dense global features on the sentence. Second, not only the size of constituents but also the constituent hierarchy is identified for each word. Third, the results are added into a transitionbased parser as soft features, rather then being used as hard constraints to a chart parser.\nOur concepts of constituent hierarchies are similar with the work of supertagging. For lexicalized grammars such as Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG) and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), each word in the input sentence is assigned one or more super tags, which are used to identify the syn-\ntactic role of the word for constraint parsing (Clark, 2002; Clark and Curran, 2004; Carreras et al., 2008; Ninomiya et al., 2006; Dridan et al., 2008). For a lexicalized grammar, supertagging can benefit the parsing in both accuracy and efficiency by offering almost-parsing information. In particular, Carreras et al. (2008) defined the concept spine in TAG, which is similar to our constituent hierarchy. However, there are three differences. First, the spine is defined to describe the main syntactic tree structure with a series of unary projections, while constituent hierarchy is defined to describe how words can start or end hierarchical constituents (it is possible to be empty if the word cannot start or end constituents). Second, spines are extracted from gold trees and used to prune the search space of parsing as hard constraints. In contrast, we use constituent hierarchies as soft features. Third, Carreras et al. (2008) use spines to prune a chart parsing, while we use constituent hierarchies to improve a linear shiftreduce parser.\nUnder the lexicalized grammar, this supertagging can benefit the parsing with more accuracy and efficiency as almost parsing (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999). Recently, the works on obtaining the super tags appear. Zhang et al. (2010a) proposed the efficient methods to obtain super tags for HPSG parsing using dependency information. Xu et al. (2015) and Vaswani et al. (2016) turn to design recursive neural network for supertagging for CCG parsing. In contrast, our models predict the constituent hierarchy instead of single super tag for each word in the input sentence, which are also likely regarded as the member of multiple ordered labels prediction family.\nOur constituent hierarchy predictor is also related to sequence-to-sequence learning (Sutskever et al., 2014), which is successful in neural machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014). The neural model encodes the source-side sentence into dense vectors, and then uses them to generate target-side word by word. There has also been work that directly use sequence-to-sequence model for constituent parsing, which generates bracketed constituency tree given raw sentences (Vinyals et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Compared to Vinyals et al. (2015), who predicts a full parser tree from input, our predictors tackle a much simpler task, by predicting the con-\nstituent hierarchies of each word separately. In addition, the outputs of the predictors are used for soft lookahead features in bottom-up parsing, rather than being taken as output structures directly.\nBy integrating the neural constituent hierarchy predictor, our parser is related to neural network models for parsing, which has given competitive accuracies for both constituency parsing (Dyer et al., 2016; Watanabe and Sumita, 2015) and dependency parsing (Chen and Manning, 2014; Zhou et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015). In particular, our parser is more closely related to neural models that integrates discrete manual features (Socher et al., 2013; Durrett and Klein, 2015). Soccer et al. use neural features to rerank a sparse baseline parser; Durrett and Klein directly integrate sparse features into neural layers in a chart parser. In contrast, we integrate neural information into sparse features in the form of lookahead features.\nThere has also been work on lookahead features for parsing. Tsuruoka et al. (2011) run a baseline parser for a few future steps, and use the output actions to guide the current action. In contrast to their model, our model leverages full sentential information, yet is significantly faster.\nExisting work on investigated efficiency of parsing without loss of accuracy, which is required by real time applications, such as web parser, processing massive amounts of textual data. Zhang et al. (2010b) introduced a chart pruner to accelerate a CCG parser. Kummerfeld et al. (2010) proposed novel self-training method focusing on increasing the speed of a CCG parser rather than its accuracy."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We proposed a novel constituent hierarchy predictor based on recurrent neural networks, aiming to capture global sentential information. The resulting constituent hierarchies are fed to a baseline shiftreduce parser as lookahead features, addressing the limitation of shift-reduce parsers in not leveraging right-hand side syntax for local decisions, yet maintaining the same model size and speed. The resulting fully-supervised parser outperforms the state-of-theart baseline parser by achieving 91.7% F1 on standard WSJ evaluation and 85.5% F1 on standard CTB evaluation."

Second, spines are extracted from gold trees and used to prune the search space of parsing as hard constraints. In contrast, we use constituent hierarchies as soft features. Third, Carreras et al.

Compared with chart-based models, they leverage richer features by extracting history information from a parser stack, which spans over non-local constituents. On the other hand, during incremental parsing, constituent information on the right hand side of the current word is not utilized, which is a relative weakness of shiftreduce parsing. To address this limitation, we leverage a fast neural model to extract lookahead features. In particular, we build a bidirectional LSTM model, which leverages the full sentence information to predict the hierarchy of constituents that each word starts and ends. The results are then passed to a strong transition-based constituent parser as lookahead features. The resulting parser gives 1.3% absolute improvement in WSJ and 2.3% in CTB compared to the baseline, given the highest reported accuracies for fully-supervised parsing.",
