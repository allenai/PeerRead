      "text" : "One of the grand goals in computer vision is to recognize and segment arbitrary objects in the wild. Recent efforts in image classification/detection/segmentation have shown this trend: emerging image datasets enable recognition on a large-scale [6, 31, 33], while image captioning can be seen as a special instance of this task [12]. However, nowadays most recognition models are still not capable of classifying objects at the level of a human, in particular, taking into account the taxonomy of object categories. Ordinary people or laymen classify things on the entry-levels, and experts give more specific labels: there is no object with a single correct label, so the prediction vocabulary is inherently open-ended. Furthermore, there is no widely-accepted way to evaluate open-ended recognition tasks, which is also a main reason this direction is not pursued more often.\nIn this work, we are pushing towards open vocabulary scene parsing: model predictions are not limited to a fixed set of categories, but also words in a larger dictionary, or even a knowledge graph. Considering existing image parsing datasets only contain a small number of categories (~100 classes), there is much more a model can learn from those images given extra semantic knowledge, like WordNet dictionary (~100,000 synsets) or Word2Vec from external corpus.\nTo solve this new problem, we propose a framework that is able to segment all objects in an image using open vocabulary labels. In particular, while the method strives to label each pixel with the same word as the one used by the human annotator, it resorts to a taxonomy when it is not sure about its prediction. As a result, our model aims to make plausible predictions even for categories that have not been shown during training, e.g. if the model has never seen tricycle, it may still give a confident guess on vehicle, performing more like a human.\nOur framework incorporates hypernym/hyponym relations from WordNet [19] to help parsing. More concretely, word concepts and image pixel features are embedded into a joint high-dimentional vector space so that (1) hypernym/hyponym relations are preserved for the concepts, (2) image pixel embeddings are close to concepts related to their annotations according to some distance measures. This framework offers three major advantages: (1) predictions are made in a structured way, i.e., they can be intermediate nodes in WordNet, and thus yielding more reasonable mistakes; (2) it is an end-to-end trainable system, its vocab-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 76\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 4\nA pr\n2 01\n7\nulary can be huge and is easily extensible; (3) the framework leaves more freedom to the annotations: inconsistent annotations from workers with different domain knowledge have less of an affect on the performance of the model.\nWe additionally explored several evaluation metrics, which are useful measures not only for our open vocabulary parsing tasks, but also for any large-scale recognition tasks where confusions often exist.\nThe open vocabulary parsing ability of the proposed framework is evaluated on the recent ADE20K dataset [34]. We further explore the properties of the embedding space by concept retrieval, classification boundary loosing and concept synthesis with arithmetics."

      "text" : "Our work is related to different topics in literature which we briefly review below.\nSemantic segmentation and scene parsing. Due to astonishing performance of deep learning, in particular CNNs [14], pixel-wise dense labeling has received significant amount of attention. Existing work include fully convolutional neural network (FCN) [17], deconvolutional neural network [20], encoder-decoder SegNet [2], dilated neural network [3, 32], etc.\nThese networks perform well on datasets like PASCAL VOC [8] with 20 object categories, Cityscapes [4] with 30 classes, and a recently released benchmark SceneParse150 [34] covering 150 most frequent daily objects. However, these models are not easily adaptable to new objects. In this paper we aim at going beyond this limit and to make predictions in the wild.\nZero-shot learning. Zero-shot learning addresses knowledge transfer and generalization [25, 10]. Models are often evaluated on unseen categories, and predictions are made based on the knowledge extracted from the training categories. Rohrbach [26] introduced the idea to transfer large-scale linguistic knowledge into vision tasks. Socher et al. [28] and Frome et al. [9] directly embedded visual features into the word vector space so that visual similarities are connected to semantic similarities. Norouzi et al. [21] used a convex combination of visual features of training classes to represent new categories. Attribute-based methods are another major direction in zero-shot learning that maps object attribute labels or language descriptions to visual classifiers [23, 1, 16, 15].\nHierarchical classifications. Hierarchical classification addresses the common circumstances that candidate categories share hierarchical semantic relations. Zweig et al. [35] combined classifiers on different levels to help improve classification. Deng et al. [7] achieved hierarchical imagelevel classification by trading off accuracy and gain as an optimization problem. Ordonez et al. [22], on the other hand, proposed to make entry-level predictions when deal-\ning with a large number of categories. More recently, Deng et al. [5] formulated a label relation graph that could be directly integrated with deep neural networks.\nOur approach on hierarchical parsing is inspired by the order-embeddings work [29], we attempt to construct an asymmetric embedding space, so that both image features and hierarchical information in the knowledge graph are effectively and implicitly encoded by the deep neural networks. While most previous approaches combine deep neural networks with optimization methods like conditional random fields so that the semantic relatedness is incorporated into the framework, the advantage of our approach is that it makes an end-to-end trainable network, which is easily scalable when dealing with larger datasets in practical applications."

      "text" : "and word concepts\nWe treat open-ended scene parsing as a retrieval problem for each pixel, following the ideas of image-caption retrieval work [29]. Our goal is to embed image pixel features and word concepts into a joint high-dimensional positive vector space RN+ , as illustrated in Figure 2. The guiding principle while constructing the joint embedding space is that image features should be close to their concept labels, and word concepts should preserve their semantic hypernym/hyponym relations. In this embedding space, (1) vectors close to origin are general concepts, and vectors with larger norms represent higher specificity; (2) hypernym/hyponym relation is defined by whether one vector is smaller/greater than another vector in all theN dimensions. A hypernym scoring function is crucial in building this embedding space, which will be detailed in Section 2.1.\nFigure 3 gives an overview of our proposed framework. It is composed of two streams: a concept stream and an\nimage stream. The concept stream tries to encode the predefined semantics: it learns an embedding function f(·) that maps the words into RN+ so that they preserve the hypernym/hyponym relationship between word concepts. The image stream g(·) embeds image pixels into the same space by pushing them close to their labels (word concepts). We describe these two streams in more details in Section 2.2 and 2.3."

For either of the streams, the goal is to maximize scores of matching pairs and minimize scores of non-matching pairs. So the choice of scoring functions S(x, y) becomes important. There are symmetric scoring functions like Lp distance and cosine similarity widely used in the embedding tasks,\nSLp(x, y) = −‖x− y‖p, Scos(x, y) = x · y. (1)\nIn order to reveal the asymmetric hypernym/hyponym relations between word concepts, hypernym scoring function [29] is indispensable,\nShyper(x, y) = −‖max(0, x− y)‖p. (2)\nIf x is hypernym of y (x y), then ideally all the coordinates of x are smaller than y ( ∧ i(xi ≤ yi)), so Shyper(x, y) = Shyper,max = 0. Note that due to asymmetry, swapping x and y will result in total different scores."

Consider all the vocabulary concepts form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) H = (V,E), sharing a common root v̂ ∈ V “entity”, each node in the graph v ∈ V can be an abstract concept as the unions of its children nodes, or a specific class as a leaf. A visualization of part of the DAG we built based on WordNet and ADE20K labels can be found in Supplementary Materials.\nInternally, the concept stream include parallel layers of a shared trainable lookup table, mapping the word concepts u, v to f(u), f(v). And then they are evaluated on hypernym scores Sconcept(f(u), f(v)) = Shyper(f(u), f(v)), which tells how confident u is a hypernym of v. A maxmargin loss is used to learn the embedding function f(·),\nLconcept(u, v) ={ −Sconcept(f(u), f(v)) if u v, max{0, α+ Sconcept(f(u), f(v))} otherwise\nNote that positive samples u v are the cases where u is an ancestor of v in the graph, so all the coordinates of f(v) are pushed towards values larger than f(u); negative samples can be inverted pairs or random pairs, the loss function pushes them apart in the embedding space.

Our mapping function g(yi,j) embeds the pixel features into the same space as their label f(xi,j), and then evaluate them with a scoring function Simage(f(xi,j), g(yi,j)).\nAs label retrieval is inherently a ranking problem, negative labels x′i,j are introduced in training. A max-margin ranking loss is commonly used [9] to encourage the scores of true labels be larger than negative labels by a margin,\nLimage(yi,j) =∑ x′i,j\nmax{0, β − Simage(f(xi,j), g(yi,j)) + Simage(f(x′i,j), g(yi,j))}.

Firstly, it should leverage the graph structure of the concepts to tell the distance of the predicted class from the ground truth. Secondly, the evaluation should correctly represent the highly unbalanced distribution of the dataset classes, which are also common in the objects seen in nature.\nTo do so, for each sample/pixel, a score s(l, p) is used to measure the similarity between the ground truth label s and the prediction p. The total accuracy is the mean score over all the samples/pixels."

      "text" : "Hierarchical precision, recall and F-score were also known as Wu-Palmer similarity, which was originally used for lexical selection [30].\nFor two given concepts l and p, we define the lowest common ancestor LCA as the most specific concept (i.e. furthest from the root Entity) that is an hypernym of both. Then hierarchical precision and recall are defined by the number of common hypernyms that prediction and label have over the vocabulary hierarchy H , formally:\nsHP (l, p) = dLCA dp , sHR(l, p) = dLCA dl . (5)\nwhere depth of the lowest common ancestor node dLCA is the number of hypernyms in common.\nCombining hierarchical precision and hierarchical recall, we get hierarchical F-score sHF (l, p) which defined as the depth of LCA node over the sum of depth of label and prediction nodes:\nsHF (l, p) = 2sHP (l, p) · sHR(l, p) sHP (l, p) + sHR(l, p) = 2 · dLCA dl + dp . (6)\nOne prominent advantage of these hierarchical metrics is they penalize predictions when they go too specific. For example, “guitar” (dl=10) and “piano” (dp=10) are all “musical instrument” (dLCA=8). When “guitar” is predicted as “piano”, sHF = 2·810+10 = 0.8; when “guitar” is predicted as “musical instrument”, sHF = 2·810+8 = 0.89. It agrees with human judgment that the prediction “musical instrument” is more accurate than “piano”."

Information content ratio, which was also used in lexical search, addresses these problems effectively.\nAccording to information theory and statistics, the information content of a message is the inverse logarithm of its\nfrequency I(c) = − logP (c). We inherit this idea and preprocess our image data to get the pixel frequency of each concept v ∈ H . Specifically, the frequency of a concept is the sum of its own frequency and all its descendents’ frequencies in the image dataset. It is expected that the root “entity” has frequency 1.0 and information content 0.\nDuring evaluations, we measure, for each testing sample, how much information our prediction gets out of the total amount of information in the label. So the final score is determined by the information of the LCA and that of the ground truth and predicted concepts.\nsI(l, p) = 2 · ILCA Il + Ip = 2 · logP (LCA) logP (l) + logP (p) (7)\nAs information content ratio requires the statistics of the image dataset and the semantic hierarchy, it rewards both inference difficulty and hierarchical accuracy."

Softmax is the baseline model that does classical multi-class classification.\nConditional Softmax is a hierarchical classification model proposed in [24]. It builds a tree based on the label relations, and softmax is performed only between nodes of a common parent, so only conditional probabilities for each node are computed. To get absolute probabilities during testing, the conditional probabilities are multiplied following the paths to root.\nWord2Vec is a model that simply regresses the image pixel features to pre-trained word embeddings, where we use the GoogleNews vectors. Since the dimensionality of GoogleNews vectors is 300, the weight dimension of the last convolution layer is a 1× 1× 4096× 300. Cosine similarity and max-margin ranking loss with negative samples are used during training. This model is a direct counterpart of DeViSe[9] in our scene parsing settings.\nWord2Vec+ is our improved version of Word2Vec model.

Concretely, from AMT we collect 3 to 5 scene descriptive sentences for each image in the ADE20K training set (20,210 images). Then we finetune the pre-trained word vectors with skip-gram model [18] for 5 epochs, and these word vectors are finally fixed for regression like Word2Vec.\nThere are 6 variants of our proposed model.

Another observation is that predictions are sometimes noisy, we get 2-3 predictions on a single objects. Some of the inconsistencies are plausible though, e.g. in the first row, the upper part of the “rocking chair” is predicted as “chair” while the lower part is predicted as “furniture”. As the pixels in the upper segment are closer to ordinary chairs while the lower segment does not, so in the latter case the model gives a more general prediction."

In Figure 8, we show score maps when searching for the concept “chair”. Interestingly, it is a common phenomenon that objects like “bench” and “ottoman”, which are not hyponyms of “chair” in WordNet, get reasonable response. We conjecture that the embedding space implicitly encodes some abstract attributes by clustering them, e.g. sittable is an affordance attribute. So by simply loosing classification threshold of “chair”, one can detect regions where one can sit on. Synthesized concepts with arithmetics. Similar to Word2Vec, in our joint embedding space, new concepts or image detectors can be synthesized with arithmetics. As shown in Figure 9, we take elementwise min and max operations on the word concepts, and then search for these synthesized concepts in the images. It can be found that max operation takes the intersection of the concepts, e.g. the pool table is the common hyponym of “table” and “game equipment”; and min takes the union, e.g. the cart is composed of attributes of “bicycle” and “canopy”."

The node radii indicate the class frequencies in the ADE20K dataset. The figure only shows part of the full graph, nodes with 5 descendents or less have been hidden."

In Figure 12, we give details of zero-shot predictions, both ground truth and prediction lists are shown in the texts beneath the images. Correct predictions are marked in green, inconsistent items are marked in orange. It can be seen that for hard examples, e.g. “dome” (row1, column3), a general and conservative prediction is made; when the test sample is easy and similar to training samples, e.g. “wagon” (row1, column1), our model gives specific and aggressive predictions."

We validate the open vocabulary prediction ability of our framework on ADE20K dataset which covers a wide variety of scenes and objects. We further explore the trained joint embedding space to show its interpretability.",
