      "text" : "Tensors, or multi-way arrays, of order higher than two, are multi-dimensional arrays indexed by three or more indices, generalizing the notion of matrix (second order tensor). Tensors and tensor decompositions or factorizations have a rich history, stretching almost a century, but only recently i.e., roughly a decade ago, have become ubiquitous in signal processing, statistics, data analytics, and machine learning.\nIndeed, psychometrics and chemometrics have historically been the application areas driving theoretical and algorithmic developments in the field. However, tensors and their decompositions were popularized by the (statisitical) signal processing and machine learning communities when they realized the power of tensor decompositions in practice. Examples of such applications include, speech, music, image, communications, biomedical, and social network signal processing and analysis, as well as clustering, dimensionality reduction, subspace, dictionary and features learning e.g., [23, 24, 30, 22, 20, 25, 14, 2].\nMore recently, there has been a considerable amount of research in establishing connections between tensor decompositions, the method of (high-order) moments, and compositional function spaces in order to learn latent variable models (e.g., mulitiview mixture model, Gaussian mixtures, Independent Component Analysis) [3], train deep neural networks with theoretical guarantees [13], and also theoretically analyze their impressive empirical performance [8].\nThe interested reader is referred to several surveys in the topic, which focus range from basics of multilinear (tensor) algebra and overview of different established tensor decompositions [17, 29], to algorithmic advances [7, 19, 10, 6, 26] and applications [1].\nBased on the above discussion, tensors and their decompositions have profound impact in signal (data) analytics and machine learning with clear theoretical, algorithmic, and practical advantages\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n09 55\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n9 O\nover their matrix counterparts. However, as opposed to matrix factorizations and matrix-based machine learning methods, tensor decompositions have not been widely adopted by data scientists and practitioners, yet. This can be mainly attributed to the fact that there is a lack in available libraries for tensor operations and decompositions, accessible from programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, Scala, etc) that data scientists and practitioners are familiar with. Even though some libraries exist for handling tensors, these are implemented in non-free platforms (e.g. MATLAB’s TensorToobox [5] and TensorLab [21]) or in low-level languages like C++ (e.g. TH++) and the deep learning libraries e.g., Tensorflow and Torch can only suboptimally handle tensors.\nPython is emerging as a language of choice for machine learning, as witnessed with the success of scikit-learn [27], and is increasingly used in both academic and industrial research projects. However, there is to date no Python library implementing tensor decomposition and learning. The exisiting ones (e.g., scikit-tensor) offer only limited algorithms (e.g., decomposition only) and/or have restrictive licenses. For applications to data analytics and machine learning, open source, well-developed and -documented libraries that include methods for tensor decompositions are urgently needed.\nTensorLy1 introduces several contributions over the existing libraries: a) it provides state of the art tensor learning including core tensor operations, tensor decomposition and tensor regression methods. b) it is open source and BSD licensed. c) it comes with extensive tests and documentation; and d) it depends exclusively on numpy and scipy.\n2 TensorLy functionality and implementation\nTensorLy has been developed with the goal to make tensor learning more accessible and to allow for seemless integration with the python scientific environment. It builds on top of two core Python libraries, Numpy [31] and Scipy [15] while having a soft-dependency on Matplotlib [12] for plotting:\nNumpy The standard library for numerical computation in Python. It offers high performance structures for manipulating multi-dimensional arrays. In particular, in TensorLy, we leverage this convenient structure for efficient tensor operations.\nScipy Provides high performance mathematical functions, advantageously using numpy’s ndarray structure.\nMatplotlib Cross-compatible 2D graphics package offering high quality image and graphics generation.\nThe Application Programming Interface (API) aims at compatibility with scikit-learn [27], which is the de-facto standard library for performing classical Machine Learning, preprocessing and crossvalidation. While scikit-learn is built to work with observations (samples) represented as vectors, this library focuses on higher order arrays.\nTensorLy’s current functionalities in term of tensor operations are summarised in Table. 2, where inside the parenthesis the mathematical notation of Kolda and Bader [17] is adopted. Furthermore, we have implemented core tensor decomposition and tensor regression methods listed in Table. 2.\nTensorLy has been tailored for the Python ecosystem and the operations are optimised for speed: tensor operations have been redefined when possible to allow for better performance. In particular, we\n1TensorLy is available at https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly\npropose an efficient unfolding of tensors which differs from the traditional one [17] by the ordering of the columns.\nGiven a tensor, X̃ ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN , the mode-n unfolding of X̃ is a matrix X[n] ∈ RIn,IM , with M = ∏N k=1, k 6=n Ik and is defined by the mapping from element (i1, i2, · · · , iN ) to (in, j), with\nj = ∑N\nk=1, k 6=n\nik × ∏N m=k+1 Im.\nNot only does this formulation achieve better performance when using C-ordering of the elements (as numpy does by default), it also translates into more natural properties. For instance, given a tensor X̃ ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN and its Tucker decomposition JG̃; U(1), · · · ,U(N)K, we can express the mode-n unfolding of X̃ as :\nX[n] = U (n)G[n] ( U(1) ⊗ · · ·U(n−1) ⊗U(n+1) ⊗ · · · ⊗U(N) )T Finally, we emphasize code quality and ease of utilisation for the end user. To that extent, both testing and documentation are an essential part of the package. Each function comes with its documentation and unit-tests (at the time of writing, the coverage is of 99 %)."

      "heading" : "3.1 Tensor regression",
      "text" : "TensorLy offers a simple interface for tensor regression with the same API as Scikit-Learn. The regressors are object that expose a fit method that takes as parameters the data tensor X̃ and the corresponding array of labels y. Given new data X̃T , the predict method returns the regressed labels yT .\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of tensor regression, we fixed the regression weights W̃ to be a second order tensor (a cross or a yin-yang image) of size (50×50). We then generated a random tensor X̃ of size (1500×50×50) of which each element was sampled from a normal distribution. Finally, we constructed the corresponding response array y of size 1500 as: ∀i ∈ {1, · · · , 1500},yi = 〈X̃i, W̃〉. We use this data to train a rank-10 Kruskal Tucker Regression and a rank (10, 10, 10) Tucker Ridge Regression. We also train a classical Ridge Regression model on the vectorised training samples (we use the scikit-learn implementation).\nIn Fig. 3.1, we present in the first column the original weight. The second and third column present the weight\nlearnt from our Tucker and Kruskal regression models while the last column presents the weights\nlearned by a classical Ridge Regression. As can be observed, tensor regression gives more interpretable result due to its ability to take into account the structure in the data that is lost when vectorising it, and thanks to its low rank weight coefficient."

      "text" : "We generated third order random tensors of size (K ×K ×K) for K varying from 10 to 400 with a step of 10, for a total of elements varying from 1,000 to 64,000,000. We then compared runtime and performance with scikit-tensor (sktensor) and the Matlab Tensor Toolbox (tensor toolbox) for CANDECOMP-PARAFAC and Tucker decomposition of these tensors.\nWe first apply a rank 10 CANDECOMP-PARAFAC decomposition via Alternating Least Squares (ALS). In Fig. 2 we show the evolution of the performance and runtime as a function of the number of elements in each mode of the tensor. Each method was run for exactly 100 iterations with an SVD based initialisation.\nSimilarly, in Fig. 3, we show the evolution of the performance and the execution time for a rank (10, 10, 10) Tucker decomposition via Higher Order Orthogonal Iteration (HOI), when running each method for exactly 100 iterations with an SVD based initialisation.\nAs can be observed, all methods yield similar performance, whilst our library offers competitive speed."

      "heading" : "4 Conclusion and future work",
      "text" : "TensorLy makes tensor learning accessible and easy by offering state-of-the-art tensor methods and operations through simple consistent interfaces under a permissive license. Interestingly, experimental evaluation indicates that tensor decomposition implemented in TensorLy are executed faster than their corresponding Matlab implementation. Thus, the library allows for efficient comparison of existing methods and can be easily extended to new ones, with systematic unit-tests and documentation.\nGoing forward we will further extend the available decompositions with other state-of-the-art methods such as PARAFAC2, DEDICOM, etc and also include robust tensor decomposition [4, 9]. It is worth noting that proximal operators for the `1 norm and nuclear norm are already available in TensorLy."

To answer this need we developed TensorLy. TensorLy is a state of the art general purpose library for tensor learning. Written in Python, it aims at following the same standard adopted by the main projects of the Python scientific community and fully integrating with these. It allows for fast and straightforward tensor decomposition and learning and comes with exhaustive tests, thorough documentation and minimal dependencies. It can be easily extended and its BSD licence makes it suitable for both academic and commercial applications. TensorLy is available at https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly.",
