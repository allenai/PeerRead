      "text" : "In this paper we study the problem of learning from random samples a probability distribution supported on a manifold, when the learning error is measured using transportation metrics.\nThe problem of learning a probability distribution is classic in statistics and machine learning, and is typically analyzed for distributions in X = Rd that have a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, with total variation, and L2 among the common distances used to measure closeness of two densities (see for instance [10, 32] and references therein.) The setting in which the data distribution is supported on a low dimensional manifold embedded in a high dimensional space has only been considered more recently. In particular, kernel density estimators on manifolds have been described in [35], and their pointwise consistency, as well as convergence rates, have been studied in [25, 23, 18]. A discussion on several topics related to statistics on a Riemannian manifold can be found in [26].\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of estimating, in the 2-Wasserstein sense, a distribution supported on a manifold embedded in a Hilbert space.\nar X\niv :1\n20 9.\n10 77\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\nThe exact formulation of the problem, as well as a detailed discussion of related previous works are given in Section 2.\nInterestingly, the problem of approximating measures with respect to transportation distances has deep connections with the fields of optimal quantization [14, 16], optimal transport [34] and, as we point out in this work, with unsupervised learning (see Sec. 4.) In fact, as described in the sequel, some of the most widely-used algorithms for unsupervised learning, such as k-means (but also others such as PCA and k-flats), can be shown to be performing exactly the task of estimating the data-generating measure in the sense of the 2-Wasserstein distance. This close relation between learning theory, and optimal transport and quantization seems novel and of interest in its own right. Indeed, in this work, techniques from the above three fields are used to derive the new probabilistic bounds described below.\nOur technical contribution can be summarized as follows:\n(a) we prove uniform lower bounds for the distance between a measure and estimates based on discrete sets (such as the empirical measure or measures derived from algorithms such as k-means);\n(b) we provide new probabilistic bounds for the rate of convergence of the empirical law of large numbers which, unlike existing probabilistic bounds, hold for a very large class of measures;\n(c) we provide probabilistic bounds for the rate of convergence of measures derived from k-means to the data measure.\nThe structure of the paper is described at the end of Section 2, where we discuss the exact formulation of the problem as well as related previous works."

      "text" : "Consider the problem of learning a probability measure ρ defined on a spaceM, from an i.i.d. sample Xn = (x1, . . . , xn) ∼ ρn of size n. We assume M to be a compact, smooth d-dimensional manifold with C1 metric and volume measure λM, embedded in the unit ball of a separable Hilbert space X with inner product 〈·, ·〉, induced norm ‖ · ‖, and distance d (for instance M = Bd2 (1) the unit ball in X = Rd.) Following [34, p. 94], let Pp(M) denote the Wasserstein space of order 1 ≤ p <∞:\nPp(M) := { ρ ∈ P (M) : ∫ M ‖x‖pdρ(x) <∞ } of probability measures with finite p-th moment. The p-Wasserstein distance\nWp(ρ, µ) = inf { [E‖X − Y ‖p]1/p , Law(X) = ρ, Law(Y ) = µ }\n(1)\nwhere the inf is over random variables X,Y with laws ρ, µ, respectively, is the optimal expected cost of transporting points generated from ρ to those\ngenerated from µ, and is guaranteed to be finite in Pp(M) [34, p. 95]. The space Pp(M) with the Wp metric is itself a complete separable metric space [34]. We consider here the problem of learning probability measures ρ ∈ P2(M), where the performance is measured by the distance W2(ρ, ·).\nThere are many possible choices of distances between probability measures [13]. Among them, Wp metrizes weak convergence (see [34] theorem 6.9), that is, in Pp(M), a sequence (µi)i∈N of measures converges weakly to µ iff Wp(µi, µ)→ 0. There are other distances, such as the Lévy-Prokhorov, or the weak-* distance, that also metrize weak convergence. However, as pointed out by Villani in his excellent monograph [34, p. 98],\n1. “Wasserstein distances are rather strong, [...]a definite advantage over the weak-* distance”.\n2. “It is not so difficult to combine information on convergence in Wasserstein distance with some smoothness bound, in order to get convergence in stronger distances.”\nWasserstein distances have been used to study the mixing and convergence of Markov chains [22], as well as concentration of measure phenomena [20]. To this list we would add the important fact that existing and widely-used algorithms for unsupervised learning can be easily extended (see Sec. 4) to compute a measure ρ′ that minimizes the distance W2(ρ̂n, ρ ′) to the empirical measure\nρ̂n := 1\nn n∑ i=1 δxi ,\na fact that will allow us to prove, in Sec. 5, bounds on the convergence of the measure induced by k-means to the population measure ρ.\nThe most useful versions of Wasserstein distance are p = 1, 2, with p = 1 being the weaker of the two (by Hölder’s inequality, p ≤ q ⇒ Wp ≤ Wq; a discussion of p = ∞ would take us out of topic, since its behavior is markedly different.) In particular, “results in W2 distance are usually stronger, and more difficult to establish than results in W1 distance” [34, p. 95]."

Since weak convergence and convergence in Wp are equivalent in Pp(M), this means that, in the Wp sense, the empirical measure ρ̂n is an arbitrarily good approximation of ρ, as n → ∞. A fundamental question is therefore how fast the rate of convergence of ρ̂n → ρ is."

In particular, given two independent samples Xn, Yn, the OBM problem is that of finding a permutation σ that minimizes the matching cost n−1 ∑ ‖xi − yσ(i)‖p [24, 30]. It is not hard to show that the optimal matching cost is Wp(ρ̂Xn , ρ̂Yn ) p, where ρ̂ Xn , ρ̂ Yn are the empirical measures associated to Xn, Yn. By Jensen’s inequality, the triangle inequality, and (a+ b)p ≤ 2p−1(ap + bp), it holds\nEWp(ρ, ρ̂n)p ≤ EWp(ρ̂Xn , ρ̂Yn ) p ≤ 2p−1EWp(ρ, ρ̂n)p,\nand therefore a bound of order O(n−p/d) for the OBM problem [2] implies a bound EWp(ρ, ρ̂n) = O(n−1/d). The matching lower bound is only known for a special case: ρA constant over a bounded set of non-null measure [2] (e.g. ρA uniform.)

      "text" : "Results for convergence in probability, one of the main results of this work, appear to be considerably harder to obtain. One fruitful avenue of analysis has been the use of so-called transportation, or Talagrand inequalities Tp, which can be used to prove concentration inequalities on Wp [20]. In particular, we say that ρ satisfies a Tp(C) inequality with C > 0 iff Wp(ρ, µ)\n2 ≤ CH(µ|ρ),∀µ ∈ Pp(M), where H(·|·) is the relative entropy [20]. As shown in [6, 5], it is possible to obtain probabilistic upper bounds on Wp(ρ, ρ̂n), with p = 1, 2, if ρ is known to satisfy a Tp inequality of the same order, thereby reducing the problem of bounding Wp(ρ, ρ̂n) to that of obtaining a Tp inequality. Note that, by Jensen’s inequality, and as expected from the behavior ofWp, the inequality T2 is stronger than T1 [20].\nWhile it has been shown that ρ satisfies a T1 inequality iff it has a finite square-exponential moment [4, 7], no such general conditions have been found for T2. As an example, consider that, if M is compact with diameter D then, by theorem 6.15 of [34], and the celebrated Csiszár-Kullback-Pinsker inequality [27], for all ρ, µ ∈ Pp(M), it is\nWp(ρ, µ) 2p ≤ (2D)2p‖ρ− µ‖2TV ≤ 22p−1D2pH(µ|ρ),\nwhere ‖ ·‖TV is the total variation norm. Clearly, this implies a Tp=1 inequality, but for p ≥ 2 it does not.\nThe T2 inequality has been shown by Talagrand to be satisfied by the Gaussian distribution [31], and then slightly more generally by strictly log-concave measures [3]. However, as noted in [6], “contrary to the T1 case, there is no hope to obtain T2 inequalities from just integrability or decay estimates.” Structure of this paper. In this work we obtain bounds in probability (learning rates) for the problem of learning a probability measure (in the sense of W2.)\nWe begin by establishing (lower) bounds for the convergence of empirical to population measures, which serve to set up the problem and introduce the connection between quantization and measure learning (sec. 3.) We then describe how existing unsupervised learning algorithms that compute a set (k-means, k-flats, PCA,. . . ) can be easily extended to produce a measure (sec. 4.) Due to its simplicity and widespread use, we focus here on k-means. Since the two measure estimates that we consider are the empirical measure, and the measure induced by k-means, we next set out to prove upper bounds on their convergence to the data-generating measure (sec. 5.) We arrive at these bounds by means of intermediate measures, which are related to the problem of optimal quantization. The bounds apply in a very broad setting (unlike existing bounds based on transportation inequalities, they are not restricted to log-concave measures.)"

      "text" : "port and quantization\nWe address the problem of learning a probability measure ρ when the only observation we have at our disposal is an i.i.d. sample Xn. We begin by establishing some notation and useful intermediate results.\nGiven a closed set S ⊆ M, let π S = ∑ q∈S 1Vq(S) · q be a nearest neighbor projection onto S (a function mapping points in X to their closest point in S), where {Vq(S) : q ∈ S} is a Borel Voronoi partition of X such that Vq(S) ⊆ {x ∈ X : ‖x − q‖ = minr∈S ‖x − r‖} (see for instance [15].) Since S is closed and ‖x − ·‖ is continuous and convex, every points x ∈ X has a closest point in S. Since {Vq(S) : q ∈ S} is a Borel partition, it follows that πS is a measurable map. For any ρ ∈ Pp(M), the pushforward, or image measure πSρ under the mapping π\nS is supported in S, and is such that, for Borel measurable sets A, it\nis (π S ρ)(A) := ρ(π−1S (A)).\nWe now establish a connection between the expected distance to a set S, and the distance between ρ and the set’s induced pushforward measure. Notice that the expected distance to S is exactly the expected quantization error incurred when encoding points drawn from ρ by their closest point in S. This close connection between optimal quantization and Wasserstein distance has been pointed out in the past in the statistics [28], optimal quantization [14, p. 33], and approximation theory literatures [16].\nThe following two lemmas are key tools in the reminder of the paper. The first highlights the close link between quantization and optimal transport.\nLemma 3.1. For closed S ⊆M, ρ ∈ Pp(M), 1 ≤ p <∞, it holds Ex∼ρd(x, S)p = Wp(ρ, πSρ) p.\nNote that the key element in the above lemma is that the two measures in the expression Wp(ρ, πSρ) must match. When there is a mismatch, the distance can only increase. That is, Wp(ρ, πSµ) ≥ Wp(ρ, πSρ) for all µ ∈ Pp(M). In fact, the following lemma shows that, among all the measures with support in S, π\nS ρ is closest to ρ.\nLemma 3.2. For closed S, and all µ ∈ Pp(M) with supp(µ) ⊆ S, 1 ≤ p <∞, it holds Wp(ρ, µ) ≥Wp(ρ, πSρ).\nWhen combined, lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 indicate that the behavior of the measure learning problem is limited by the performance of the optimal quantization problem. For instance, Wp(ρ, ρ̂n) can only be, in the best-case, as low as the optimal quantization cost with codebook of size n. The following section makes this claim precise."

      "text" : "Consider the situation depicted in fig. 1, in which a sample X4 = {x1, x2, x3, x4} is drawn from a distribution ρ which we assume here to be absolutely continuous on its support. As shown, the projection map π\nX4 sends points x to their closest\npoint in X4. The resulting Voronoi decomposition of supp(ρ) is drawn in shades of blue. By lemma 5.2 of [9], the pairwise intersections of Voronoi regions have null ambient measure, and since ρ is absolutely continuous, the pushforward measure can be written in this case as π\nX4 ρ = ∑4 j=1 ρ(Vj)δxj , where Vj is the\nVoronoi region of xj . Note that this decomposition is not always possible if, for instance ρ has an atom falling on two Voronoi regions: both regions would count the atom as theirs, and double-counting would imply ∑ j ρ(Vj) > 1. The technicalities required to correctly define ρ(Vj) are such that, in general, it is simpler to write πSρ, even though (if S is discrete) this measure can clearly be written as a sum of deltas with appropriate masses.\nBy lemma 3.1, the distance Wp(ρ, πX4ρ) p is the (expected) quantization cost of ρ when using X4 as codebook. Clearly, this cost can never be lower than the optimal quantization cost of size 4. This reasoning leads to the following lower bound between empirical and population measures.\nTheorem 3.3. For ρ ∈ Pp(M) with absolutely continuous part ρA 6= 0, and 1 ≤ p < ∞, it holds Wp(ρ, ρ̂n) = Ω(n−1/d) uniformly over ρ̂n, where the constants depend on d and ρA only.\nProof: Let Vn,p(ρ) := infS⊂M,|S|=n Ex∼ρd(x, S)p be the optimal quantization cost of ρ of order p with n centers. Since ρA 6= 0, and since ρ has a finite (p+ δ)-th order moment, for some δ > 0 (since it is supported on the unit ball), then it is Vn,p(ρ) = Θ(n\n−p/d), with constants depending on d and ρA (see [14, p. 78] and [16].) Since supp(ρ̂n) = Xn, it follows that\nWp(ρ, ρ̂n) p ≥\nlemma 3.2 Wp(ρ, πXnρ) p = lemma 3.1 Ex∼ρd(x,Xn)p ≥ Vn,p(ρ) = Θ(n−p/d)\nNote that the bound of theorem 3.3 holds for ρ̂n derived from any sample Xn, and is therefore stronger than the existing lower bounds on the convergence rates of EWp(ρ, ρ̂n) → 0. In particular, it trivially induces the known lower bound Ω(n−1/d) on the expected rate of convergence.\nThe consequence of theorem 3.3 is clearly that the rate of convergence of the empirical law of large numbers is limited (in all cases), by the dimension of\nthe space in which ρ is absolutely continuous. This justifies the choice of formal setting to be a d-manifold (or even Rd): by the above uniform lower bound, one is effectively forced to make a finite-dimension assumption on the space where ρ is absolutely continuous."

      "text" : "a probability measure\nAs described in [21], several of the most widely used unsupervised learning algorithms can be interpreted to take as input a sample Xn and output a set Ŝk, where k is typically a free parameter of the algorithm, such as the number of means in k-means1, the dimension of affine spaces in PCA, etc. Performance is measured by the empirical quantity n−1 ∑n i=1 d(xi, Ŝk)\n2, which is minimized among all sets in some class (e.g. sets of size k, affine spaces of dimension k,. . . ) This formulation is general enough to encompass k-means and PCA, but also k-flats, non-negative matrix factorization, and sparse coding (see [21] and references therein.)\nUsing the discussion of Sec. 3, we can establish a clear connection between unsupervised learning and the problem of learning probability measures with respect to W2. Consider as a running example the k-means problem, though the argument is general. Given an input Xn, the k-means problem is to find a set |Ŝk| = k minimizing its average distance from points in Xn. By associating to Ŝk the pushforward measure πŜk ρ̂n, we find that\n1\nn n∑ i=1 d(xi, Ŝk) 2 = Ex∼ρ̂nd(x, Ŝk)2 = lemma 3.1 W2(ρ̂n, πŜk ρ̂n) 2. (2)\nSince k-means minimizes equation 2, it also finds the measure that is closest to ρ̂n, among those with support of size k. This connection between k-means and W2 measure approximation was, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, first suggested by Pollard [28] though, as mentioned earlier, the argument carries over to many other unsupervised learning algorithms.\nWe briefly clarify the steps involved in using an existing unsupervised learning algorithm for probability measure learning. Let Uk be a parametrized algorithm (e.g. k-means) that takes a sample Xn and outputs a set Uk(Xn). The measure learning algorithm Ak :Mn → Pp(M) corresponding to Uk is defined as follows:\n1. Ak takes a sample Xn and outputs the measure πŜk ρ̂n, supported on Ŝk = Uk(Xn);\n2. since ρ̂n is discrete, then so must πŜk ρ̂n be, and thusAk(Xn) = 1 n ∑n i=1 δπŜk (xi) ;\n1 In a slight abuse of notation, we refer to the k-means algorithm here as an ideal algorithm that solves the k-means problem, even though in practice an approximation algorithm may be used.\n3. in practice, we can simply store an n-vector [ πŜk(x1), . . . , πŜk(xn) ] , from\nwhich Ak(Xn) can be reconstructed by placing atoms of mass 1/n at each point.\nIn the case that Uk is the k-means algorithm, only k points and k masses need to be stored.\nNote that any algorithm A′ that attempts to output a measure A′(Xn) close to ρ̂n can be cast in the above framework. Indeed, if S\n′ is the support of A′(Xn) then, by lemma 3.2, πS′ ρ̂n is the measure closest to ρ̂n with support in S\n′. This effectively reduces the problem of learning a measure to that of finding a set, and is akin to how the fact that every optimal quantizer is a nearest-neighbor quantizer (see [15], [12, p. 350], and [14, p. 37–38]) reduces the problem of finding an optimal quantizer to that of finding an optimal quantizing set.\nClearly, the minimum of equation 2 over sets of size k (the output of kmeans) is monotonically non-increasing with k. In particular, since Ŝn = Xn and πŜn ρ̂n = ρ̂n, it is Ex∼ρ̂nd(x, Ŝn) 2 = W2(ρ̂n, πŜn ρ̂n) 2 = 0. That is, we can always make the learned measure arbitrarily close to ρ̂n by increasing k. However, as pointed out in Sec. 2, the problem of measure learning is concerned with minimizing the distance W2(ρ, ·) to the data-generating measure. The actual performance of k-means is thus not necessarily guaranteed to behave in the same way as the empirical one, and the question of characterizing its behavior as a function of k and n naturally arises.\nFinally, we note that, while it is Ex∼ρ̂nd(x, Ŝk)2 = W2(ρ̂n, πŜk ρ̂n) 2 (the empirical performances are the same in the optimal quantization, and measure learning problem formulations), the actual performances satisfy\nEx∼ρd(x, Ŝk)2 = lemma 3.1 W2(ρ, πŜkρ) 2 ≤ lemma 3.2 W2(ρ, πŜk ρ̂n) 2, 1 ≤ k ≤ n.\nConsequently, with the identification between sets S and measures π S ρ̂n, the set-approximation problem is, in general, different from the measure learning problem (for example, if M = Rd and ρ is absolutely continuous over a set of non-null volume, it’s not hard to show that the inequality is almost surely strict: Ex∼ρd(x, Ŝk)2 < W2(ρ, πŜk ρ̂n)\n2 for n > k > 1.) In the remainder, we characterize the performance of k-means on the measure learning problem, for varying k, n. Although other unsupervised learning algorithms could have been chosen as basis for our analysis, k-means is one of the oldest and most widely used, and the one for which the deep connection between optimal quantization and measure approximation is most clearly manifested. Note that, by setting k = n, our analysis includes the problem of characterizing the behavior of the distance W2(ρ, ρ̂n) between empirical and population measures which, as indicated in Sec. 2.1, is a fundamental question in statistics (i.e. the speed of convergence of the empirical law of large numbers.)"

By establishing a precise connection between optimal transport metrics, optimal quantization, and learning theory, we derive new probabilistic bounds for the performance of a classic algorithm in unsupervised learning (k-means), when used to produce a probability measure derived from the data. In the course of the analysis, we arrive at new lower bounds, as well as probabilistic upper bounds on the convergence rate of the empirical law of large numbers, which, unlike existing bounds, are applicable to a wide class of measures.",
