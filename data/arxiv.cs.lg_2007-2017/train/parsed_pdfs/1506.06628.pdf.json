Existing cross-media retrieval methods usually learn one couple of projections, by which the original features of images and text can be projected into a common latent space to measure the content similarity. However, using the same projections for the two different retrieval tasks (I2T and T2I) may lead to a tradeoff between their respective performances, rather than their best performances. Different from previous works, we propose a modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR) model, where two couples of projections are learned for different cross-media retrieval tasks instead of one couple of projections. Specifically, by jointly optimizing the correlation between images and text and the linear regression from one modal space (image or text) to the semantic space, two couples of mappings are learned to project images and text from their original feature spaces into two common latent subspaces (one for I2T and the other for T2I). Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed MDCR compared with other methods. In particular, based the 4,096 dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) visual feature and 100 dimensional LDA textual feature, the mAP of the proposed method achieves 41.5%, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on the Wikipedia dataset.\nCategories and Subject Descriptors: H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models\nGeneral Terms: Design, Algorithms, Performance\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: cross-media retrieval, subspace learning, canonical correlation analysis\nACM Reference Format: ACM Trans.

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "With the rapid development of information technology, multi-modal data (e.g., image, text, video or audio) have been widely available on the Internet. For example, an image often co-occurs with text on a web page to describe the same object or event. Related research has been conducted incrementally in recent decades, among which the retrieval across different modalities has attracted much attention and benefited many practical applications. However, multi-modal data usually span different feature spaces. This heterogeneous characteristic poses a great challenge to cross-media retrieval tasks. In this work, we mainly focus on addressing the cross-media retrieval between text and images (Fig. 1), i.e., using image (text) to search text documents (images) with the similar semantics.\nTo address this issue, many approaches have been proposed by learning a common representation for the data of different modalities. We observe that most exiting works [Hardoon et al. 2004; Rasiwasia et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2012; Gong et al. 2013] focus on learning one couple of mapping matrices to project high-dimensional features from different modalities into a common latent space. By doing this, the correlations of two variables from different modalities can be maximized in the learned common latent subspace. However, only considering pair-wise closeness [Hardoon et al. 2004] is not sufficient for cross-media retrieval tasks, since it is required that multi-modal data from the same semantics should be united in the common latent subspace. Although [Sharma et al. 2012] and [Gong et al. 2013] have proposed to use supervised information to cluster the multi-modal data with the same semantics, learning one couple of projections may only lead to compromised results for each retrieval task.\nIn this paper, we propose a modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR) method, which recommends different treatments for different retrieval tasks, i.e., I2T and T2I. Specifically, MDCR is a task-specific method, which learns two couples of projections for different retrieval tasks. The proposed method is illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(c) are two linear regression operations from the image and the text feature space to the semantic space, respectively. By doing this, multi-modal data with the same semantics can be united in the common latent subspace. Fig. 2(b) is a correla-\nACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\ntion analysis operation to keep pair-wise closeness of multi-modal data in the common space. We combine Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) to learn a couple of projections for I2T, and a different couple of projections for T2I is jointly optimized by Fig. 2(b) and Fig. 2(c). The reason why we learn two couples of projections rather than one couple for different retrieval tasks can be explained as follows. For I2T, we argue that the accurate representation of the query (i.e., the image) in the semantic space is more important than that of the text to be retrieved. If the semantics of the query is misjudged, it will be even harder to retrieve the relevant text. Therefore, only the linear regression term from image feature to semantic label vector and the correlation analysis term are considered for optimizing the mapping matrices for I2T. For T2T, the reason is the same as that for I2T. The main contributions of this work are listed as follow:\n•We propose a modality-dependent cross-media retrieval method, which projects data of different modalities into a common space so that similarity measurement such as Euclidean distance could be applied for cross-media retrieval. •To better validate the effectiveness of our proposed MDCR, we compare it with other\nstate-of-the-arts based on more powerful feature representations. In particular, with the 4,096 dimensional CNN visual feature and 100 dimensional LDA textual feature, the mAP of the proposed method reaches 41.5%, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on the Wikipedia dataset as far as we know. •Based on the INRIA-Websearch dataset [Krapac et al. 2010], we construct a new\ndataset for cross-media retrieval evaluation. In addition, all the features utilized in this paper are publicly available1.\nThe remainder of this paper in organized as follows. We briefly review the related work of cross-media retrieval in Section 2. In Section 3, the proposed modalitydependent cross-media retrieval method is described in detail. Then in Section 4, experimental results are reported and analyzed. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions."

      "heading" : "2. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "During the past few years, numerous methods have been proposed to address crossmedia retrieval. Some works [Hardoon et al. 2004; Tenenbaum and Freeman 2000; Rosipal and Krämer 2006; Yang et al. 2008; Sharma and Jacobs 2011; Hwang and Grauman 2010; Rasiwasia et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2012; Gong et al. 2013; Wei et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2014] try to learn an optimal common latent subspace for multi-modal data. This kind of methods projects representations of multiple modalities into an isomorphic space, such that similarity measurement can be directly applied between multi-modal data. Two popular approaches, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [Hardoon et al. 2004] and Partial Least Squares (PLS) [Rosipal and Krämer 2006; Sharma and Jacobs 2011], are usually employed to find a couple of mappings to maximize the correlations between two variables. Based on CCA, a number of successful algorithms have been developed for cross-media retrieval tasks [Rashtchian et al. 2010; Hwang and Grauman 2010; Sharma et al. 2012; Gong et al. 2013]. The work [Rashtchian et al. 2010] investigated the cross-media retrieval problem in terms of correlation hypothesis and abstraction hypothesis. Based on the isomorphic feature space obtained from CCA, a multi-class logistic regression is applied to generate a common semantic space for cross-media retrieval tasks. In [Hwang and Grauman 2010], Hwang et al. used KCCA to develop a cross-media retrieval method by modeling the correlation between visual features and textual features. The work [Sharma\n1https://sites.google.com/site/yunchaosite/mdcr\nACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\net al. 2012] presented a generic framework for multi-modal feature extraction techniques, called Generalized Multiview Analysis (GMA). More recently, the work [Gong et al. 2013] proposed a three-view CCA model by introducing a semantic view to produce a better separation for multi-modal data of different classes in the learned latent subspace.\nTo address the problem of prohibitively expensive nearest neighbor search, some hashing-based approaches [Kumar and Udupa 2011; Wu et al. 2014] to large scale similarity search have drawn much interest from the cross-media retrieval community. In particular, [Kumar and Udupa 2011] proposed a cross view hashing method to generate hash codes by minimizing the distance of hash codes for the similar data and maximizing the distance for the dissimilar data. Recently, [Wu et al. 2014] proposed a sparse multi-modal hashing method, which can obtain sparse codes for the data across different modalities via joint multi-modal dictionary learning, to address cross-modal retrieval. Besides, with the development of deep learning, some deep models [Frome et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Lu et al. 2014; Zhuang et al. 2014] have also been proposed to address cross-media problems. Specifically, [Frome et al. 2013] presented a deep visual-semantic embedding model to identify visual objects using both labeled image data and semantic information obtained from unannotated text documents. [Wang\nACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, Vol. V, No. N, Article A, Publication date: January YYYY.\net al. 2014] proposed an effective mapping mechanism, which can capture both intramodal and inter-modal semantic relationships of multi-modal data from heterogeneous sources, based on the stacked auto-encoders deep model.\nBeyond the above mentioned models, some other works [Yang et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2012; Wu et al. 2013; Zhai et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2014] have also been proposed to address cross-media problems. In particular, [Wu et al. 2013] presented a bi-directional cross-media semantic representation model by optimizing the bi-directional list-wise ranking loss with a latent space embedding. In [Zhai et al. 2013], both the intra-media and the inter-media correlation are explored for crossmedia retrieval. Most recently, [Kang et al. 2014] presented a heterogeneous similarity learning approach based on metric learning for cross-media retrieval. With the convolutional neural network (CNN) visual feature, some new state-of-the-art cross-media retrieval results have been achieved in [Kang et al. 2014]."

      "text" : "In this section, we detail the proposed supervised cross-media retrieval method, which we call modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR). Each pair of image and text in the training set is accompanied with semantic information (e.g., class labels). Different from [Gong et al. 2013] which incorporates the semantic information as a third view, in this paper, semantic information is employed to determine a common latent space with a fixed dimension where samples with the same label can be clustered.\nSuppose we are given a dataset of n data instances, i.e., G = {(xi, ti)}ni=1, where xi ∈ Rp and ti ∈ Rq are original low-level features of image and text document, respectively. Let X = [x1, ...,xn]T ∈ Rn×p be the feature matrix of image data, and T = [t1, ..., tn]T ∈ Rn×q be the feature matrix of text data. Assume that there are c classes in G. S = [s1, ..., sn]\nT ∈ Rn×c is the semantic matrix with the ith row being the semantic vector corresponding to xi and ti. In particular, we set the jth element of si as 1, if xi and ti belong to the jth class. Definition 1: The cross-media retrieval problem is to learn two optimal mapping matrices V ∈ Rc×p and W ∈ Rc×q from the multi-modal dataset G, which can be formally formulated into the following optimization framework:\nmin V,W\nf(V,W ) = C(V,W ) + L(V,W ) +R(V,W ), (1)\nwhere f is the objective function consisting of three terms. In particular, C(V,W ) is a correlation analysis term used to keep pair-wise closeness of multi-modal data in the common latent subspace. L(V,W ) is a linear regression term from one modal feature space (image or text) to the semantic space, used to centralize the multi-modal data with the same semantics in the common latent subspace.R(V,W ) is the regularization term to control the complexity of the mapping matrices V and W .\nIn the following subsections, we will detail the two algorithms for I2T and T2I based on the optimization framework Eq.(1)."

We note that Eq.(2) is convex with respect to either V1 or W1 while fixing the other. Similarly, Eq.(3) is also convex with respect to either V2 or W2 while fixing the other. Specifically, by fixing V1(V2) or W1(W2), the minimization over the other can be finished with the gradient descent method.\nThe partial derivatives of V1 or W1 over Eq.(2) are given as follows: ∇V1f (V1,W1) = V1XTX + 2 [ η1V1 − λW1TTX − (1− λ)STX ] , (4)\n∇W1f (V1,W1) = 2 [ η2W1 + λ ( W1T TT − V1XTT )] .

With a different train/test division, [Wu et al. 2014] achieved an average mAP score of 0.226 (Image Query: 0.227, Text Query: 0.224) through a sparse hash model and [Wang et al. 2014] achieved an average mAP score of 0.183 (Image Query: 0.187, Text Query: 0.179) through a deep auto-encoder model.

It can be seen that some new state-of-the-art performances are achieved by these methods based on the new feature representations and the proposed MDCR can also outperform others. In addition, we also compare our method with the recent work [Kang et al. 2014], which utilizes 4,096-CNN for images and 200-LDA for text, in Table III.

For the text query (the 4th row), there exist many Warfare descriptions in the document such as war, army and troops, which can be hardly realted to the label of the query text, i.e. Art.\nFor the Pascal Sentence dataset and the INRIA-Websearch dataset, we experimentally set λ = 0.5, η1 = 0.5, η2 = 0.5, µ = 0.02 and = 10−4 during the alternative optimization process for I2T and T2T.

Existing cross-media retrieval methods usually learn one couple of projections, by which the original features of images and text can be projected into a common latent space to measure the content similarity. However, using the same projections for the two different retrieval tasks (I2T and T2I) may lead to a tradeoff between their respective performances, rather than their best performances. Different from previous works, we propose a modality-dependent cross-media retrieval (MDCR) model, where two couples of projections are learned for different cross-media retrieval tasks instead of one couple of projections. Specifically, by jointly optimizing the correlation between images and text and the linear regression from one modal space (image or text) to the semantic space, two couples of mappings are learned to project images and text from their original feature spaces into two common latent subspaces (one for I2T and the other for T2I). Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed MDCR compared with other methods. In particular, based the 4,096 dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) visual feature and 100 dimensional LDA textual feature, the mAP of the proposed method achieves 41.5%, which is a new state-of-the-art performance on the Wikipedia dataset.",
