      "text" : "This thesis has been supported by IKY fellowships of excellence for post graduate studies in Greece-Siemens Program.\nVarious chapters demonstrate, partially, research outcomes, obtained during the following projects:\n1. POSEIDON: Development of an Intelligent System for Coast Monitoring using Camera\nArrays and Sensor Networks in the context of the inter-regional programme INTERREG (Greece-Cyprus cooperation) - contract agreement K1 3 1017/6/2011. 2. 4D-CH-World: Four Dimensional Cultural Heritage World, Marie Curie IAPP project\nGrant agreement number 324523.\n3. ROBO-SPECT: Robotic system with intelligent vision and control for tunnel structural\ninspection and evaluation, European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no 611145.\nI would, also, thank my colleges and professors in School of production engineering and management, whom fields of research provided various opportunities to validate many of this thesis ideas.\nAt first, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Nikolaos Matsatsinis, for his support, tutorship and for letting me run with my own ideas at my own pace. Many years ago, I had been taught that data are easy to obtain; extracting information, in a meaningful way, is the tricky part. I was able to realize the true meaning of this phrase after some time, during my involvement with decision systems, as a student. It was Mr. Matsatsinis research interests and knowledge, in Information and decision support systems development, which facilitated the creation of many sophisticated systems, presented in this thesis.\nI would like, also, to thank Mr. Anastasios Doulamis, who introduced me to the word of machine learning, during an undergraduate course introduction to artificial intelligence, more than ten years ago. It was a whole new word of notions and mathematical formulations. At first everything appeared too complex. Yet, all this knowledge had countless application domains; especially during the development phase of any decision support system.\nDefining a problem is not an easy task; there are always many variables and constraints that have to be satisfied. On top of that, there are always multiple objectives that contradict each other. The significance of trade-offs, among the objectives, became apparent. Handling such trade-offs, as well as, brief and robust formulation techniques were taught by Mr. Michael Doumpos.\nEven if you manage to formulate a problem, there is no guarantee of finding the optimal solution; in that case, you should look for good ones. Thanks to Mr. Yannis Marinakis, I started utilizing genetic optimization tools, in order to find “good” solutions at complex problems. Thankfully, genetic algorithms could be applied anywhere, overriding the need of heuristic approaches.\nMy introduction to the multidisciplinary field of engineering, called Mechatronics, occurred back in 2008, by Mr. Georgios Stavroulakis. The necessity of synergies, among various machine\nlearning techniques, was engraved to my mind more than seven years ago. Yet, the combination of various techniques is not an easy task; excessive testing, parameters definition and performance impact analysis is a common phenomenon. Facing such challenges force you to think outside of the box.\nThe involvement with large datasets, occurred while working with Mr. Stelios Tsafarakis. Missing entries exist everywhere, complicating any type of data analysis. Dealing with such issues, forced me to understanding the importance of sampling and handling the missing data.\nLast, but not least, I would like to thank Mr. Nikolaos Grammalidis for his acceptance to participate in this thesis committee, despite asking him, literally, the very last moment.\nSpecial Thanks\nMany thanks to my family and all those who were like a family to me. The life of a student has many unexpected situations, which can become a burden, if you don’t have reliable persons by your side.\nSpecial thanks go to my professor Mr. Anastasios Doulamis who was the “grey eminence” behind many of this thesis’ topics. His expertise and deep knowledge on multiple research fields was a great help, supporting the development of various approaches on real life application scenarios. Thanks to his active evolvement in various projects, I was able to learn, test and validate various techniques related to this thesis subjects. As a character he is a rather calm and kind person, whose advice was crucial and extremely helpful in all kind of situations, in a rather chaotic life of Ph.D. student.\nThe contribution of Konstantinos Makantasis was, also, extremely important. He has a solid foundation in computer vision field and an even better foundation in machine learning field. Thankfully, many of his research topics and ideas were ideal to apply semi-supervised learning approaches. It has been more than five years sharing the same office; no quarrels, no disputes. Only ideas, conferences, traveling and all kind of deadlines to catch in our daily lives.\nHow to cite\nIf you would like to cite this work, I recommend using the following bibtex entry:\n@phdthesis{protopapadakis_decision_2016, address = {Greece}, title = {Decision {Making} via {Semi} {Supervised} {Machine} {Learning} {Techniques}}, school = {Technical University of Crete}, author = {Protopapadakis, Eftychios}, year = {2016} }\nRelated Publications\nThis thesis research outcomes contributed to the following publications:\n[1] Kyriakaki, G., Doulamis, A., Doulamis, N., Ioannides, M., Makantasis, K., Protopapadakis,\nE., Hadjiprocopis, A., Wenzel, K., Fritsch, D., Klein, M., Weinlinger, G., 2014. 4D Reconstruction of Tangible Cultural Heritage Objects from Web-Retrieved Images.

The assignment required the development of an appropriate methodology for visual surveillance of industrial assembly lines, in a user friendly way; i.e. the development of an appropriate Decision Support System (DSS), able to handle complex data, in a cost effective way, avoiding long initialization processes.\nDSSs is a broad term utilized in many cases (Geertman and Stillwell, 2012; Knijnenburg et al., 2012; Martínez et al., 2010). Regardless the application scenario, the main goal is always the same: Provide information to the user, in a meaningful way, supporting the decision making process. DSSs exploit a variety of methods from the machine learning field. They utilize available data in order to create appropriate structures and inference mechanisms. In the end, created structures produce an outcome for specific data, at a user’s request.\nIt is evident that available data induce DSS performance (H. Chen et al., 2012; Demirkan and Delen, 2013); the more we have the better the performance, assuming that we have data of good quality. Nowadays, data availability is not such a problem. However, data abundance does not imply good features quality, neither explicit information over them. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) deals directly with these two major disadvantages.\nSSL approaches emerge naturally, as the data availability grow bigger over the years. We need approaches that utilize a small portion of data, processed by an expert, with a many times greater portion, available online. SSL exploits experts’ knowledge on a minimum amount of data, minimizing both the effort and the cost. Simultaneously, it take into account the rest of the available data in order to create high quality DSSs.\nIn this thesis, various real life applications are presented, where SSL was necessary for the development of an appropriate DSSs. The first chapter is dedicated in SSL history, for the sake of completeness. If you are interested in the semi-supervised learning field, an excellent start would be the work of (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009a). The rest of the thesis chapters are dedicated to specific real-life application scenarios.\nEach of the chapters follows a similar structure. A brief description of the problem is provided at first. Then, the related work section describes the most recent approaches on the field1. As such, we can identify weak points and extend current research. Finally, a mathematical formulation is formed and applied. The end of each chapter contains experimental results and conclusions.\n1 To the best of our knowledge, by the time published either as journal or conference paper.\nContents 1 Introduction

      "text" : "In this section we try to grasp, briefly, the notion behind Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). As we will see, the core idea lies in the need for evolution, of existing techniques, in a cost effective way. It is extremely important to handle the data abundance, in a meaningful way, in order to: (a) improve model’s performance and (b) minimize experts’ interventions. As such, the first steps on the SSL field begun around 1960 when scientists started exploiting new (i.e. unseen so far, unlabeled) data to advance their models’ abilities. Since then, and up to date, SSL field continues to involve, motivated by the data abundance of our age."

      "heading" : "1.1 Definition of semi-supervised machine learning",
      "text" : "SSL is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled and unlabeled data. Thus, SSL falls between unsupervised learning, e.g. (Ranzato et al., 2007; Konstantinos Makantasis et al., 2013), and supervised learning, e.g. (Doulamis et al., 2003; Kosmopoulos et al., 2011). The main idea lies in the usefulness of unlabeled data (Seeger, 2001); when used, in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can considerably improve the model’s performance in terms of accuracy, precision, etc.\nUnlabeled data exploitation is based on various assumptions, regarding their structure and the feature space properties. There are in total three main assumptions, which can be used either alone or as a combination. Given an assumption, at least one appropriate regularizer over the unlabeled data is formed and utilized. Then, the model is trained and the overall performance is evaluated.\nSSL is used, mainly, for classification (Olivier Chapelle et al., 2006; Zhu, 2005). Other approaches involve feature reduction (Cheng et al., 2008) and hybrid hashing techniques (J. Wang et al., 2012), regression (Cortes and Mohri, 2006), and clustering (Anand et al., 2014; Grira et al., 2004) problems. There are, also, cases outside previous categories, e.g. metric learning (Q. Y. Wang et al., 2012); the work of (Hoi et al., 2008) utilized SSL to appropriate calculate a distance metric, applied in an image retrieval scenario."

      "heading" : "1.2 A brief history",
      "text" : "Usage of unlabeled data, in classification problems, is documented in 1965-1970 period. These approaches were using self-training techniques (Agrawala, 1970; Fralick, 1967; Scudder, H., 1965). The concept of such approach was rather simple; train a model, use it over new data to produce results, and use the new results to further train the model. Latter appeared transductive learning (Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1974; Vapnik and Sterin, 1977). In this case the labeling procedure occurs only on the currently available (unlabeled) data. In contrast to inductive inference, no general decision rule is inferred.\nIn the 1970s appeared the estimation problem of Fisher linear discriminant rule with unlabeled data (Hosmer, 1973; McLachlan, 1977; McLachlan and Ganesalingam, 1982; O’neill, 1978). The main approach involved mixture of Gaussians and the expectation maximization algorithm into an iterative algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). The goal was the maximization of likelihood in both labeled and unlabeled data. Such approaches used\n2 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\none-component-per-class setting. Yet, it is possible to use multiple components (Miller and Uyar, 1996; Shahshahani and Landgrebe, 1994) or different mixture models (Cooper and Freeman, 1970).\nTheoretical analysis over the SSL field first took place in 1980. The work of (Ratsaby and Venkatesh, 1995), over a mixture of two Gaussians, produced learning rates in a probably approximately correct framework. Additionally, if we have an identifiable mixture, with an infinite number of unlabeled points, the probability of error has an exponential convergence to the Bayes risk (Castelli and Cover, 1995). Theoretical analysis is still an active field (Lafferty and Wasserman, 2007; Nadler et al., 2009).\nAfter 1990, SSL has been extensively used in natural language problems (Collins and Singer, 1999; Yarowsky, 1995) and text classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Nigam et al., 2000). The co-training approach was introduced by (Blum and Mitchell, 1998); the two classifiers (or hypotheses) must agree on the much larger unlabeled data as well as the labeled data. Evaluating results over generative mixture models and EM are shown in (Nigam and Ghani, 2000).\nAt the same time emphasis where given in discriminative decision boundaries and their placement away from dense regions. That problem led to transductive support vector machines, a method that is NP-hard. Primary researchers had focused on efficient approximation algorithms. Early algorithms (Demiriz and Bennett, 2001) (Fung & Mangasarian, 1999) either cannot handle more than a few hundred unlabeled examples, or did not do so in experiments. The SVM-light TSVM implementation (Joachims, 1999) is the first widely used software.\nIn the 2000s graph-based methods (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006) emerged. The data are represented by the nodes of a graph, the edges of which are labeled with the pairwise distances of the incident nodes (and a missing edge corresponds to infinite distance). The SSL concept in a graph minimum cut problem was used by (Blum and Chawla, 2001) for binary classification. Since then, research has focused on different regularizers exploitation (Niu et al., 2013) and effective weight matrix construction (Liu et al., 2010), in order to deal with scalability issues.\nThe last decade emphasis is given on synergies. At first the methodology of (Ratle et al., 2010) constitutes a general framework for building computationally efficient semi-supervised methods on hyperspectral image classification problems. The work of (Kingma et al., 2014) is based on deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference, exploiting recent advances in variational methods. Deep hybrid Boltzmann machines and deep noising auto encoders are described in (Ororbia II et al., 2015).\n3 Introduction\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

      "text" : "The acquisition of labeled data for a learning problem often requires a skilled human agent (e.g. to transcribe an audio segment, annotate background in an image, etc.) or a physical experiment (e.g. determining the 3D structure of a protein ,determining whether there is oil at a particular location). The cost associated with the labeling process, thus, may render a fully labeled training set infeasible, whereas acquisition of unlabeled data is relatively inexpensive. In such situations, SSL can be of great practical value2. SSL is also of theoretical interest in machine learning field and as a model for human learning.\nOne major advantage is the easy implementation on existing techniques; SSL can be directly or indirectly incorporated in any machine learning task. Semi-supervised SVMs approaches are a classical example of direct usage of SSL assumptions into the minimization function (Qi et al., 2012). Indirect utilization of SSL can be found in multi-objective optimization (MOO) frameworks (Alok et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2012; Kobayashi et al., 2012). In MOO we have multiple fitness evaluation functions; many of them are based on SSL assumptions. Then, from a large pool of possible solution we peak those over the Pareto front. Thus, SSL is involved in the best individual selection procedure.\nIn real life, there are literally countless fields of testing, assuming that there is data availability. Some examples, further developed in the following chapters, are provided: The work of (E. Protopapadakis et al., 2015) evaluates the foundation piles structural situation using graph based approaches. A scalable graph based approach was used in (Makantasis et al., 2015c) for the initialization of a maritime surveillance system. The SSL cluster assumption was used in (Makantasis et al., 2015b) for the initialization of a fall detection system for elder people. A self-training approach is adopted by (Protopapadakis et al., 2012) for industrial workflow surveillance purposes in Nissan factories. In cultural heritage, SSL has been exploited by (Protopapadakis and Doulamis, 2014) in order to develop image retrieval schemes suitable to the user preferences.\n2 There are, of course, other approaches dealing with the labeling cost; active learning (Demir et al., 2014), noisy labelers (Ipeirotis et al., 2013), etc.\n4 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nChapter II: The Basics\nYou can't cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.

Additionally, we provide further information regarding the main assumptions of the field, the various regularizers and the techniques’ taxonomy. In order to understand the utilized techniques and proposed approaches of this thesis, someone needs to grasp the basic formulations on the field3. At very fist, we start with some basic notations, most of them are in accordance with (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009a).\nLet us denote as \uD835\uDCE7 ∈ ℝ\uD835\uDC51 the space of input values (i.e. features originating from available data) and \uD835\uDCB4 ∈ ℝ\uD835\uDC5A, the space of output values. \uD835\uDC7F = {\uD835\uDC651, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B} . The space of input values is divided in two sub sets \uD835\uDC7F\uD835\uDC3F = {\uD835\uDC651, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC59} and \uD835\uDC7F\uD835\uDC48 = {\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC59+1, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B} . We also have \uD835\uDC80\uD835\uDC3F ⊂ \uD835\uDC80 available outputs. Generally, the decision mechanism is a function \uD835\uDC53: ℝ\uD835\uDC51 → ℝ\uD835\uDC5A, that maps any given \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56 ∈ \uD835\uDCE7 to an appropriate \uD835\uDC66\uD835̂\uDC56 ∈ ℝ \uD835\uDC5A.

At this point, let us explain why we prefer \uD835\uDC66\uD835̂\uDC57 ≅ \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC57, rather than \uD835\uDC66\uD835̂\uDC57 = \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC57, ∀\uD835\uDC57 = 1, … , \uD835\uDC59.

If \uD835\uDC7F ⊂ \uD835\uDCE7 then we may have transductive or inductive learning (depending on the method). If \uD835\uDC7F = \uD835\uDCE7 we have transductive learning: we have a set of observations and we do not expect any more. Thus, we utilize all of them. The goal of transductive learning is to infer the correct labels for the given unlabeled data \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC59+1, … , \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC59+\uD835\uDC62 only (i.e. current subspace). The goal of inductive learning is to infer the correct mapping from \uD835\uDC4B to \uD835\uDC4C (i.e. entire space \uD835\uDCE7). Put it simply, inductive techniques can generalize to unseen data and transductive cannot. Thus, according to (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009a) we have:\nInductive semi-supervised learning: Given a training sample, {(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC56)}\uD835\uDC56=1 \uD835\uDC59 , {\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57}\uD835\uDC57=\uD835\uDC59+1\n\uD835\uDC5B , inductive semi-\nsupervised learning learns a function \uD835\uDC53: \uD835\uDCE7 → \uD835\uDCE8 so that \uD835\uDC53 is expected to be a good predictor on future data, {\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC58}\uD835\uDC58=\uD835\uDC5B+1 \uD835\uDC5A . Like in supervised learning, one can estimate the performance on future data by using a separate test sample {\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC58 , \uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC58}\uD835\uDC58=\uD835\uDC5B+1 \uD835\uDC5A , which is not available during training.\nTransductive learning: Given the same training sample, as before, transductive learning trains a function \uD835\uDC53: \uD835\uDCE7 → \uD835\uDCE8 so that \uD835\uDC53 is expected to be a good predictor on the unlabeled data, {\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57}\uD835\uDC57=\uD835\uDC59+1 \uD835\uDC5B . Note \uD835\uDC53 is defined only on the given training sample, and is not required to make predictions outside. It is therefore a simpler function.\n3 Rest assured these formulations are repetitive and very consistent among the researchers on the SSL field.

SSL algorithms make use of at least one of the following assumptions.\n1. Smoothness assumption: Points which are close to each other are more likely to share a label. This is also\ngenerally assumed in supervised learning and yields a preference for geometrically simple decision boundaries. In the case of semi-supervised learning, the smoothness assumption additionally yields a preference for decision boundaries in low-density regions, so that there are fewer points close to each other but in different classes (Zhou et al., 2004). 2. Cluster assumption: The data tend to form discrete clusters, and points in the same cluster are more likely\nto share a label (although data sharing a label may be spread across multiple clusters). This is a special case of the smoothness assumption and gives rise to feature learning with clustering algorithms (Li et al., 2008). 3. Manifold assumption: The data lie approximately on a manifold of much lower dimension than the input\nspace. In this case we can attempt to learn the manifold using both the labeled and unlabeled data to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Then learning can proceed using distances and densities defined on the manifold. Manifolds are usually estimated using graphs (Belkin and Niyogi, 2004)."

      "heading" : "2.2.2 Regularization",
      "text" : "Regularization, in the fields of machine learning and inverse problems, refers to a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. This information is usually of the form of a penalty for complexity, such as restrictions for smoothness or bounds on the vector space norm. This section focuses on gasping the regularization notion by providing few characteristic examples, exploited in SSL. Thus, depending on the assumption, we may have smoothness, cluster or manifold based (Niyogi, 2013) regularizers. There are, also, approaches that utilize multiple regularizers (Chapelle and Zien, 2004; Chen and Wang, 2011).\nSmoothness regularization involves around significant changes in \uD835\uDC53 values, for closely located feature vectors \uD835\uDC99. To put it simply, we do not want a function that does too many jumps (Belkin et al., 2004), especially in dense areas. A typical smoothness functional is the following (Belkin et al., 2004):\n\uD835\uDC46(\uD835\uDC53) = ∑ \uD835\uDC7E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57(\uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC56 − \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC57) 2\n\uD835\uDC56~\uD835\uDC57\n(2.1)\nIn eq. (2.1) the sum is taken over the adjacent vertices of a given graph. For “good” functions \uD835\uDC53 the functional \uD835\uDC46(⋅) takes small values. A natural extension of this idea is the cluster assumption. Cluster regularization involves around decision boundaries. The boundaries are forced away from high density regions. As such, a cluster based regularizer is also, expected to create a smooth function.\nCluster based approaches assume that the data contains clusters, which have homogeneous labels, and the unlabeled observations are used to identify these clusters. This idea can be put in practice in several ways, giving rise to various methods. The simplest is: estimate the clusters, then label each cluster uniformly. Most of these methods (Hartigan and Wong, 1979) use definition of clusters , namely the connected components of the density level sets. However, they use a parametric -usually mixture- model to estimate the underlying\n6 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\ndensity which can be far from reality. An investigation on generalization error bounds has been provided by (Rigollet, 2006).\nThe cluster assumption can be interpreted in another way, that is, as the requirement that the decision boundary has to lie in low density regions. This interpretation has been widely used in learning since it can be used in the design of standard algorithms such as Boosting (d’Alché-Buc et al., 2002; Hertz et al., 2004) or SVM (Chapelle and Zien, 2004), which are closely related to kernel methods mentioned above. In these algorithms, a greater penalization is given to decision boundaries that cross a cluster.\nManifold regularization is a different approach from the previous two, supported by a much larger collection of algorithms. Manifold regularization involves two steps: the creation of an appropriate manifold and the use of a regularizer over it. The most common approach for manifold creation is the data adjacency graph, which can be calculated in many ways (Belkin and Niyogi, 2004; Luo et al., 2013). Any regularizer applied over the graph is a manifold regularizer.\nManifold learning has been widely used for capturing the local geometry (Fan et al., 2011) and conducting low-dimensional embedding (L. Chen et al., 2012). In manifold regularization, the data manifold is characterized by a nearest-neighbor-graph \uD835\uDCB2, which explores the geometric structure of the compact support of the marginal distribution. The Laplacian ℒ of \uD835\uDCB2 and the prediction \uD835\uDC1F = [ \uD835\uDC53 (\uD835\uDC651), … , \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B)] are then formulated as a smoothness constraint ‖\uD835\uDC53‖\uD835\uDC3C 2 = \uD835\uDC1FT . The manifold regularization framework minimizes the regularized loss:\nargmin \uD835\uDC53∈ℋ\uD835\uDC58\n1 \uD835\uDC59 ∑ \uD835\uDC3F(\uD835\uDC53, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56)\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n+ \uD835\uDEFE\uD835\uDC34‖\uD835\uDC53‖\uD835\uDC58 2 + \uD835\uDEFE\uD835\uDC3C‖\uD835\uDC53‖\uD835\uDC3C 2 (2.2)\nwhere \uD835\uDC3F is a predefined loss function, \uD835\uDC58 is the standard scalar valued kernel, i.e., \uD835\uDC58 ∶ \uD835\uDCB3 × \uD835\uDCB3 → ℝ, and ℋ\uD835\uDC58 is the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Here, \uD835\uDEFE\uD835\uDC34 and \uD835\uDEFE\uD835\uDC3C are trade-off parameters to control the complexities of \uD835\uDC53 in the ambient space and the compact support of the marginal distribution. The representer theorem (Belkin et al., 2006) ensures the solution of eq. (2.2) takes the form \uD835\uDC53∗(\uD835\uDC65) = ∑ \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC58(\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56) \uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC56=1 , where \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56 ∈ ℝ is a coefficient. A pair of close samples means that the corresponding conditional distributions are similar, so that the manifold regularization ‖\uD835\uDC53‖\uD835\uDC3C 2 helps the function learning.\nWhile many semi-supervised algorithms have been derived from this perspective and many have enjoyed empirical success, there are few theoretical analyses that characterize the class of problems on which manifold regularization approaches are likely to work (Niyogi, 2013). In particular, there is some confusion on a seemingly fundamental point. Even when the data might have a manifold structure, it is not clear whether learning the manifold is necessary for good performance (de Sousa et al., 2015)."

This procedure involves reducing the amount of resources required to describe a large set of data. When performing analysis of complex data one of the major problems stems from the number of variables involved. Analysis with a large number of variables generally requires a large amount of memory and computation power or a classification algorithm which overfits the training sample and generalizes poorly to new samples. Feature extraction is a general term for methods of constructing combinations of the variables to get around these problems while still describing the data with sufficient accuracy.\nIn other words, bad features harm the accuracy of the model. The work of (Makantasis et al., 2015a) demonstrates that low level features are not sufficient for complex visual recognition tasks.

To temper the cubic time complexity, recent studies seek to reduce the intensive computation upon the graph Laplacian manipulation or deal with other possible issues (Delalleau et al., 2005; Fergus et al., 2009; Karlen et al., 2008; Tsang and Kwok, 2006; Zhu and Lafferty, 2005).

Such model specifies a joint probability distribution over observation and label sequences, \uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC66). Generative models are used in machine learning for either modeling data directly (i.e., modeling observations drawn from a probability density function), or as an intermediate step to forming a conditional probability density function. Recent examples, in the fields of computer vision and text analysis, is the work of (Beecks et al., 2011; Kang et al., 2012; Lücke and Eggert, 2010; Rauschert and Collins, 2012; F. Zhuang et al., 2012).\nGenerative models recognize the semi-supervised learning problem as a specialized missing data imputation task for the classification problem. Existing generative approaches based on models such as Gaussian mixture or hidden Markov models (Zhu and Ghahramani, 2002), have not been very successful due to the need for a large number of mixtures components or states to perform well. Yet, there is also evidence that generative models can converge faster than discriminative, as shown by (Ng and Jordan, 2002)Ng and Jordan (2002), and so are valuable when dealing with small data sets.\nAssuming that there is a data set \uD835\uDC7F\uD835\uDC3F = {(\uD835\uDC991, \uD835\uDC9A1), … , (\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC59 , \uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC59)}, we wish to fit a model parameterized by some set of parameters \uD835\uDF03 to the set’s distribution, using maximum likelihood method:\n\uD835\uDF03∗ = \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC54max \uD835\uDF03 ∑ log(\uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56|\uD835\uDF03))\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n(2.4)\nHowever, there is no guarantee that eq.

Thus, incorporating the unlabeled data, we have the following equation:\n\uD835\uDF03\uD835\uDC46 ∗ = \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC54max\n\uD835\uDF03 [∑ log(\uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56|\uD835\uDF03))\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n+ ∑ log(\uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56|\uD835\uDF03))\n\uD835\uDC59+\uD835\uDC62\n\uD835\uDC56=\uD835\uDC5B+1\n] (2.5)\nYet, eq. (2.5) has proven to give mixed results, sometime improving model fitting, other times worsening it. Various solutions have used non-parametric density models, either based on trees (Kemp et al., 2004) or Gaussian processes (Adams and Ghahramani, 2009), but scalability and accurate inference for these approaches is still lacking. Variational approximations for semi-supervised clustering have also been explored previously (Li et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009). In order to guarantee the decrease of the misclassification risk the distribution should be identifiable (Castelli and Cover, 1996).\nThe asymptotic behavior of semi-supervised learning where the model is miss-specified has been further studied by (O. Chapelle et al., 2006), where no assumptions are made about the parametric model being close to the underlying distribution. In particular, they show that the limiting value of the optimum parameters, when performing ML semi-supervised learning in such a scenario are:\n\uD835\uDF03∗ = \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC54max \uD835\uDF03 [(1 − \uD835\uDF06)\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC4B,\uD835\uDC4C)(log \uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC66|\uD835\uDF03)) + \uD835\uDF06\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99)] (2.6)\nwhere \uD835\uDF06 is the probability of a sample being unlabeled and \uD835\uDC38(⋅) is a combination of objective functions. If \uD835\uDF06 varies (say by adding unlabeled samples) then this will likely change the optimal parameters \uD835\uDF03∗, and so the associated error rate.

They argue that with a few assumptions on the modelling densities, \uD835\uDF03∗ is a continuous function of \uD835\uDF06. They also show that an instance where the asymptotically optimal parameters are not changed by \uD835\uDF06 comes, as might be expected, when the model is “correct” and can be fitted exactly to the underlying distribution; i.e., the true distribution \uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC66) is a member of the family of distributions that can be modelled by \uD835\uDC43(\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC66|\uD835\uDF03).\n9 Understanding the SSL field\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

      "text" : "In self-training a model is first trained with the small amount of labeled data and then is used to classify the unlabeled data. Typically the most confident unlabeled points, together with their predicted labels, are added to the training set. The classifier is re-trained and the procedure repeated by using its own predictions. Mathematical foundation on convergence was given for specific learners in (Culp and Michailidis, 2008; Haffari and Sarkar, 2012).\nSelf-training has been applied to several natural language processing tasks: word sense disambiguation (Yarowsky, 1995), identification of subjective nouns (Riloff et al., 2003), Self-training has also been applied to parsing and machine translation as shown in work of (Rosenberg et al., 2005) who applied self-training to object detection systems from images. The work of (Protopapadakis et al., 2012), on industrial surveillance, utilized a similarity based mechanism to refine self-trained classifier’s outputs.\nThe demand for redundant views of the same input data is a major difference between multi-view and singleview learning algorithms. Thanks to these multiple views, the learning task can be conducted with abundant information. However if the learning method is unable to cope appropriately with multiple views, these views may even degrade the performance of multi-view learning. Through fully considering the relationships between multiple views, several successful multi-view learning techniques have been proposed (Xu et al., 2013). many of them have been modified in order to use SSL assumptions (Sun, 2013). A very common approach in Multi-view learning is co-training.\nCo-training has been proposed by (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), in which the description of each samples can be partitioned into two distinct views. The basic idea is to train two learners separately on each view, and then each learner predicts unlabeled samples to enlarge the training set for the other. However, there is a drawback in co-training algorithms: the repeated loop of learning process reduces the learning speed and reinforces the error. Co-training makes a strong assumption that the two feature sets involved should be conditionally independent given a class. Although some studies have been done to relax this assumption with weaker ones (Balcan et al., 2004), a basic intuitive requirement, that the involved classifiers should be different enough from each other, should be met so that they can complement each other (S. Li et al., 2011).\n10 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nHow to select basic learners is extremely important in co-training (Li et al., 2013). Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a new supervised learning method, proposed by (Huang et al., 2006) for single-hidden layer feed forward networks. ELM has received considerable attention in computational intelligence and machine learning communities, and a few variants have been proposed, e.g., fully complex ELM, online sequential ELM, incremental ELM and ELM ensembles (Huang et al., 2011). Some researchers have paid attention to semisupervised ELM and there have been appeared graph-based semi-supervised ELM method (J. Liu et al., 2011) and ternary reversible Extreme Learning Machines (Tang and Han, 2009)."

      "text" : "The low-density separation assumption pushes the decision boundary in regions where there are few data points (labeled or unlabeled). The most common approach to achieving this goal is to use a maximum margin algorithm such as support vector machines. The method of maximizing the margin for unlabeled as well as labeled points is called the transductive SVM (TSVM). However, the corresponding problem is non-convex and thus difficult to optimize (Singla et al., 2014).\nThe training process is actually an iterative algorithm (Sindhwani and Keerthi, 2006). Starting from the SVM solution as trained on the labeled data only, the unlabeled points are labeled by SVM predictions, and the SVM is retrained on all points. This is iterated while the weight of the unlabeled points is slowly increased. Another interesting fact is that, despite the name, TSVM are used for inductive reasoning (Pang and Kasabov, 2004). They can handle unseen data because they are defined over the whole problem space (Qi et al., 2012). An illustration of the S3VM is shown in Figure 2.3.\nLow density separation (LDS) is a combination of transductive SVMs (Bruzzone et al., 2006), trained using gradient descend, and traditional SVMs using appropriate kernel defined over a graph using SSL assumptions (Chapelle and Zien, 2004). Similar to the SVM approach the TSVM need to maximize then margin (i.e. the minimum distance between a hyperplane and the closest example vectors in \uD835\uDC7F.

Intuitively speaking, in a graph that various data points are connected, greater the similarity greater the probability of having similar labels. Thus, the information (of labels) propagates from the\n12 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nlabeled points to the unlabeled ones. Researchers utilized such methods because some datasets are naturally represented by a graph (e.g. web, citation networks, and social networks). An illustration of data connection in graphs is shown in Figure 2.4.\nAn indicative paradigm of graph based SSL is the harmonic function approach (Zhu, 2003). This approach estimates a function \uD835\uDC53 on the graph which satisfies two conditions.

      "text" : "In graph based approaches, weight matrix, \uD835\uDC7E, has to be well-defined so that the graph Laplacian matrix, \uD835\uDC73, will be invertible. In order to create an appropriate weigh matrix we first need to define the graph among the available points. The following heuristic approaches have been used extensively:\n1. Fully connected graph, where every pair of vertices \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 is connected by an edge. The edge weight\ndecreases as the Euclidean distance ‖\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 − \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57‖ increases. One popular weight function is: \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 =\nexp (− ‖\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56−\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57‖\n2\n2\uD835\uDF0E2 ) where \uD835\uDF0E is known as the bandwidth parameter and controls how quickly the weight\ndecreases. This weight has the same form as a Gaussian function. It is also called a Gaussian kernel or a\nRadial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. The weight is 1 when \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 = \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 , and 0 when ‖\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 − \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57‖ approaches infinity. 2. \uD835\uDC8CNN graph. Each vertex defines its \uD835\uDC58 nearest neighbor vertices in some distance. Note if \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 is among \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57\n’s kNN, the reverse is not necessarily true: \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 may not be among \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 ’s kNN. We connect \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 if one of them is among the other’s kNN. This means that a vertex may have more than \uD835\uDC58 edges. If \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 are connected, the edge weight \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 is either the constant 1 (i.e. unweighted graph), or a function of a distance (e.g. RBF kernel). If \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 are not connected, \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 = 0. 3. \uD835\uDF50NN graph. We connect \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 if \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 − \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57 ≤ \uD835\uDF16. The edges can either be unweighted or weighted. If \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC56 , \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC57\nare not connected, \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 = 0. Generally, \uD835\uDF16NN graphs are easier to construct than kNN graphs.\nA comparative study in graph creation can be found in (L. Zhuang et al., 2012). There is no dominant methodology. Empirically talking, the matrix creation approach depends on the given problem and the computational cost. Usually graph construction employs the Euclidean distance. Also, keep in mind that \uD835\uDC58 should be small (e.g. 3 or 5). Otherwise, we will have a bad estimation of the manifold and the label propagation will cause many errors. \uD835\uDC58NN graph automatically adapts to the density of instances in feature space: in a dense region, the kNN neighborhood radius will be small; in a sparse region, the radius will be large.\nAnother point of interesting is the nature of the graph based approaches. Thus we have two major issues:\n1. Data correctness; what if some labeled data are by mistake misclassified? That is a common case,\nespecially when we have manually annotation of image collections; e.g. as in (Makantasis et al., 2015c).\n2. New (unseen) data handling; how can we handle new data, without having to recreate the entire graph\neach time?\nThose two issues led to manifold regularization approach; we can have an inductive learning algorithm defining \uD835\uDC53 in the whole feature space: \uD835\uDC53: \uD835\uDCB3 → ℝ, allowing \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56) ≠ \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC56 = 1, … , \uD835\uDC59 in some cases; we may skip any constraints and try to optimize a generalized (manifold) problem of the form:\nmin \uD835\uDC53:\uD835\uDCB3→ℝ (∑ \uD835\uDC50(\uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC56), \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC56)\n\uD835\uDC59\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n+ \uD835\uDF061‖\uD835\uDC53‖ 2 + \uD835\uDF062\uD835\uDC87 \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC73\uD835\uDC87 ) (2.14)\nwhere \uD835\uDC50(\uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC66) is a convex loss function, ‖\uD835\uDC53‖2 = ∫ \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDC65)2\uD835\uDC65∈\uD835\uDCB3 \uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC65 is a regulization term over the entire space \uD835\uDCB3, and \uD835\uDF062\uD835\uDC87 \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC73\uD835\uDC87 is the traditional smoothness regularizer over the existing manifold.

In classification tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. The arcs coming from a node labeled with a feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the feature. Each leaf of the tree is labeled with a class or a probability distribution over the classes.\nAlgorithms for constructing decision trees usually work top-down, by choosing a variable at each step that best splits the set of items (Rokach and Maimon, 2005). Different algorithms use different metrics for measuring \"best\". These generally measure the homogeneity of the target variable within the subsets. These metrics are applied to each candidate subset, and the resulting values are combined (e.g., averaged) to provide a measure of the quality of the split.\nGiven a set of items, suppose \uD835\uDC56 ∈ {1, … , \uD835\uDC5A}, and \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC56 the portion of the items labeled with \uD835\uDC56 among the \uD835\uDC5A alternatives.

ANNs are universal approximators which however have multiple local minima (i.e. solutions), due to their structure; they are composed from multiple hierarchical layers of interconnected nodes. Their structure consists of weights, biases and activation functions, imitating the real brain's neurons and synapses. Therefore simple computational units called neurons, which are highly interconnected are used. The work of (Hagan et al., 1996) provides a clear and detailed survey of basic neural network architectures and learning rules. The most widely used learning algorithm in an ANN is the back-propagation algorithm or its variations (Chakraborty and Ghosh, 2012).\nLet us denote as \uD835\uDC53 a non-linear function (relationship) that indicates the status of a given datum (e.g. structural capacity of a pile, corresponding class, system’s response, etc.). This non-linear relationship is approximated\nby a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) architecture. Denote as \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC98 the approximated function of \uD835\uDC53 as has been produced by the FFNN structure, where \uD835\uDC98 denotes the neural network weights.

To estimate these weights, a reliable training set \uD835\uDC46 is needed. It has been shown in (Hornik et al., 1989) that a feed-forward neural network can approximate any non-linear function within any degree of accuracy. One of the most important problems, during network training, is overfitting, a situation in which the network can memorize training samples, providing a very small error on data of training set, without being able to generalize to new situations, i.e. bad generalization performance (Doulamis et al., 2000). One method for addressing this problem is to use the cross validation technique.\n18 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nThe network performance, however, depends on a number of parameters, such as the network size, the number of neurons and the attributes used as inputs to the network. There is, also, the adopted trainingalgorithm impact. Apparently, proper selection of the network size is \"art\" in the sense that there are no concrete mathematical rules to define the structure, apart from proposing worst bounds.

      "text" : "Credit risk analysis is a fundamental and challenging issue in financial risk management, and has been the major topic of financial and banking industry in the last decades. Credit scoring models have been extensively used to evaluate the credit risk of enterprises, and they can classify the applicants as either accepted or rejected according to the examined criteria. Over the past decades, a great sum of credit risk decision models have been proposed and evaluated (Marqués et al., 2013; Thomas, 2000).\nExisting approaches in credit risk assessment, mainly, include linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression (Vojtek and Kocenda, 2006; Zeng and Gao, 2009), nearest neighbor analysis (Henley and Hand, 1996), Bayesian networks (Pavlenko and Chernyak, 2010), artificial neural networks (Baesens et al., 2003), decision trees (Zhang et al., 2010), genetic algorithms (Abdou, 2009), multiple criteria decision making (J. Li et al., 2011; Niklis et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014), support vector machines (Bellotti and Crook, 2009; Martens et al., 2007) and so on. Recently, increasing interests in the synergies of optimization and data\n25 Labeled data selection impact in credit risk assessment\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nmining can be observed (Corne et al., 2012; Meisel and Mattfeld, 2010; Niklis et al., 2013; Olafsson et al., 2008).\nRegardless the core method for the credit assessment, all possible sources of variation, which will be encountered later, must be included in the training data set; the model will be used for the prediction of new samples. In other words, the training data should have a greater variation in feature attributes than the data to be analyzed. As such, before applying any assessment model, we should provide with a good data set; important factors affecting the overall performance of such models can be the class imbalance, outliers and low quality features.\n(Abdou and Pointon, 2011) review 214 previous studies on credit scoring applications, emphasizing on the statistical techniques used for evaluation. Results indicate that there is not an overall best technique for building assessment models. It appears that assessment models setup is usually heuristically defined, depending on the data availability, application field and various other factors. Current literature provides extensive comparison results among credit scoring methods; e.g. the review of (Marqués et al., 2013) advocates the benefits of using evolutionary computation for credit scoring.\nHowever, due to the great variation of factors in model assessment performance there is always room for further analysis and comparative studies. Thus, in section 4.4.2 we perform a comparative study among various, well-known, sampling techniques and predictive models, trying to identify the best possible combination for the credit risk assessment problem in Greek commercial sector."

Advanced data analysis techniques are currently used to evaluate risk in credit approval (Huang et al., 2004) and fraud detection (Ngai et al., 2011). Recent literature in the search of trends, in data mining applications, for the banking industry can be found in (Moro et al., 2015).\nData mining methods, especially pattern classification, using real-world historical data, is of paramount importance in building such predictive models (Yu et al., 2008). Other approaches involve hybrid data mining techniques, filtering algorithms, attribute relevance, etc. in the following lines we present a brief description over recent approaches.\nFor example, (W. Chen et al., 2012) proposed a hybrid data mining technique which contains two processing stages. The proposed model was a two-stage approach: k-means cluster, support vector machines classification and computation of feature importance. Experimental results based on the credit data set provided by a local bank in China showed that by choosing a proper cut-off point, super classification accuracy of the good and the bad credit is obtained. In (Yap et al., 2011) data mining techniques were used to improve the assessment of credit worthiness of credit scoring models. More specifically, three models were examined: credit scorecard model, logistic regression model and decision tree model. Results show the performances of the three models are quite similar. Scorecards are relatively much easier to deploy in practical applications.\nThe work of (García et al., 2012), investigated whether the application of filtering algorithms leads to an increase in accuracy of instance-based classifiers in the context of credit risk assessment. The experimental results show that the filtered sets perform significantly better than the non-preprocessed training sets when using the nearest neighbor decision rule. (Khashman, 2011), investigate the efficiency of emotional NNs and compare their performance to conventional NNs when applied to credit risk evaluation. Experimental results suggest that both neural models can be used effectively for credit risk evaluations, however the emotional models outperform their conventional counterparts in decision making speed and accuracy, making them ideal for implementation in fast automatic processing of credit applications.\n26 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nA very popular problem, among these studies, is the attribute relevance by using new and existing feature selection algorithms (Chen and Li, 2010; Liu and Schumann, 2005; Shukai et al., 2010). Few studies address the problem of credit data with noise and outliers. (Kotsiantis et al., 2006) present a survey of data preprocessing techniques for financial prediction, including discretization, feature selection and instance selection. (Tsai and Chou, 2011) use a genetic algorithm to perform feature selection and data filtering for bankruptcy prediction. (Tsai and Cheng, 2012) explore the performance of artificial neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression and support vector machines after removing different amounts of outliers from credit data sets."

      "text" : "In this chapter, a two-step process is adopted, in order to assess commercial firms’ credit risk. The first step involves data sampling; i.e. the selection of the most descriptive representatives in the available data set. The second step, employs popular data mining algorithms; i.e. predictive models are trained over the descriptive subsets of the previous step. Generated models’ performance is calculated for a set of evaluation metrics, plus the computational cost (in terms of time spend during initialization process), in order to analyze both the efficiency of sampling schemes and the synergies’ outcomes.\nThe selection of a subset of individuals, from within a currently available data set, to estimate characteristics of newly appeared data, is a crucial step. Such an approach is able to identify the most representative cases and handle class imbalances in an effective manner, as the infrequent nature of defaults affects the performance of predictive models. There are many sampling approaches, varying from random sample selection to more complicated techniques. Sampling can be used in many ways (i.e. outliers removal (Janssens et al., 2012), feature subset selection (Daszykowski et al., 2002a), representative data selection (Elhamifar et al., 2012), etc.). In our case, sampling approach moderates the effects of two common problems; i.e. classimbalanced data sets and training/evaluation ratio.\nClass-imbalance is a major and very common problem, many studies show that a classifier tends to over-fit the observations of majority-class and simultaneously under-fit the observations of minority-class (Akbani et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2008; Zeng and Gao, 2009). Additionally, even in class-balanced data sets, there are no explicit rules regarding the data amount allocated between training and test sets. As we can see in Table 4.1, there is no census over the proportion for the training set over the currently available data. However, there is a general trend in utilizing around 70% of the data for the training process and evaluating the performance with the remaining 30%.\nRegarding the classification models, a variety of them was utilized, ranging from traditional approaches (e.g. logistic regression) to soft computing techniques (e.g. artificial neural networks). These models required set up for at least one parameter. These parameters were defined using heuristic approaches, or they were remain intact at their original values, as provided by the software developers.

The data were obtained from the financial database of ICAP, as described in (Niklis et al., 2014). All observations in this sample are classified as default or non-default on the basis of the definition of default employed by ICAP, which considers a range of default-related events such as bankruptcy, protested bills, uncovered cheques, payment orders, etc. Table 4.2 presents the number of observations per year and category.\nOn the basis of data availability and the relevant literature seven financial ratios are used to describe the financial status of the firms in both samples. The selection of the appropriate financial ratios is a challenging issue. In fact, there is a big variety of ratios that can be used as proxies of the same financial dimensions (leverage, liquidity, profitability, etc.). Furthermore, time and cost issues arise when using a large number of ratios and this can also cause multi-colinearity problems. Table 4.3 presents the selected ratios together with their expected relationship (sign) to the creditworthiness of the firms. A positive sign (+) is used to indicate ratios which are positively related to the creditworthiness of the firms, in the sense that higher values in these\n28 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nratios are expected to improve the creditworthiness of the firms. The rest of the ratios are assigned a negative sign (–) indicating their negative relationship with the performance and viability of the firms (i.e., as these ratios increase the likelihood of default is also expected to increase).\nWe have four categories of financial ratios (efficiency, profitability, liquidity and financial leverage) and four non-financial indicators that are crucial for commercial companies. Management efficiency ratios are typically used to analyze how well a company uses its assets and liabilities. Efficiency ratios are important because an improvement in the ratios usually translates to improved profitability. We have selected three ratios in this category, which are positive related to credit risk, in the sense that the higher their value, the higher is the probability of default.\nThe profitability indicators are used to assess firm’s ability to generate earnings, compared to its expenses and other relevant costs incurred during a specific period of time. The profitability ratios considered in this study include the return on assets ratio and ratio of financial expenses to sales. The first one is negative related to credit risk in contrast with the second one which is positively associated to the probability of default.\nFinally, the category of solvency indicators includes two ratios related to the liquidity and the financial leverage of the firms. Liquidity determines a company’s ability to pay off its short-term debt obligations. In this study the quick ratio (Current assets-Inventories/Short-term liabilities) is used which is negative related to credit risk. On the other hand, financial leverage provides an indication of the long-term solvency of a firm. Here the ratio of total liabilities to total assets is used which is positive related to credit risk.\nApart from financial indicators there should be a consideration of other factors that affect the operation of a firm. In our case, two factors are examined:\n1. Logarithm of employees (LOGE). This is an indicator of the size of a company, which has been shown in\npast studies to be negatively associated to the probability of default.\n2. Activity indicator. For commercial companies it is important to take into consideration the type of their\nactivities. In this study, in accordance with ICAP’s modeling approach, the activities of the companies in\nthe sample are characterized by the following three binary indicators: exports indicator (EXP), imports\nindicator (IMP), and Representations indicator (REPR); i.e., companies that are local resellers of products\nof foreign companies.\nTable 4.3 summarizes the numerical values of the selected financial ratios, for each group of observations (i.e., default, non-default).

The proposed sampling approaches utilize many of the previously described algorithms in various ways.\nWhen many samples are available, we can first measure their spectra and select a representative set that covers the calibration space (x-space) as well as possible. Normally such a set should also represent the yspace well, this should preferable be verified. The chemical analysis with the reference method, which is often the more expensive step, can then be restricted to the selected samples.\nSeveral approaches are available for selecting representative calibration samples. The simplest is random selection, but it is open to the possibility that some sources of variation will be lost. These variation sources are often represented by samples that are less common and have little probability of being selected. A second possibility is based on knowledge about the problem. If one is confident that we are aware of all the sources of variation, samples can be selected on the basis of that knowledge. However, this situation is rare and it is very possible that some source of variation will be forgotten.\nGiven an evaluation year, \uD835\uDC41, sampling approaches actuate over years \uD835\uDC41 − 1, \uD835\uDC41 − 2, … . Bellow we present a brief description of the proposed approaches. The size of the final train set can be found in Table 4.5. Training data sets consist of all defaulted firms plus an indicative number of non-defaulted ones.\n1. OPTICS extrema: We perform Optics algorithm on the entire data set. Then we locate local maxima and\nminima, over OPTICS calculated distances. All the extrema indexes are considered as labeled instances\nand the rest as unlabeled. The proposed approach results in a very limited train set; OPTICS approach\nresults in the minimum possible sum of outliers, given a feature set and a distance metric. Selected points\nlocation can be anywhere in the data spanning area. The code of this algorithm was provided by the\nauthors of (Daszykowski et al., 2002b).\n2. Sparse modeling representative selection (SMRS): we perform the SMRS approach over the entire data\nset. The proposed approach results in a very limited train set, which is, however, greater than OPTICS\nextrema approach. In contrast to OPTICS, selected points are located only on the exterior cell of the\navailable data volume. The algorithm has the same implementation as in (Elhamifar et al., 2012).\n3. Combination of OPTICS and SMRS (OPTICS SMRS). In this case SMRS is used among the sub-clusters\nindicated by OPTICS algorithm. This approach is similar to the work of (Protopapadakis et al., 2014). It\n5 Inventories / Cost of sales ratio was significant at 5%.\n30 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\ncreates a small subset of representative samples. This approach locate the most descriptive data among\neach subcluster, as indicated by OPTICS output.\n4. Combination of \uD835\uDC58-means and SMRS (k-means SMRS). We first divide the set into \uD835\uDC58 sub clusters. For each\nsub cluster we run SMRS algorithm to get the representative samples among each subcluster. As such,\noutcome results in surrounding points for each of the subclusters.\n5. Kennard and Stone (KenStone) sampling data points. We execute KenStone algorithm over years \uD835\uDC41 −\n1, \uD835\uDC41 − 2, … . Thus, we have data entries spanning uniformly the entire data space in each of the given\nyears. The code was provided by the authors of (Daszykowski et al., 2002a).\n6. Random selection. A random selection that picks 40% of the previous years’ data as training samples.\n7. An alternative approach is the creation of \uD835\uDC58 clusters (using k-means) and a random selection of \uD835\uDC5A samples\nfrom each cluster (k-means RANDOM). It can be seen as an improvement of random selection, without\ninvolving any advanced techniques. Similar instances are, likely, clustered together. Thus, the few random\nsamples from each cluster are expected to provide adequate information, over the data set.\nAlmost all previously mentioned methods require some parameters as input. These parameters were estimated using heuristic approaches. For instance, the number of clusters, \uD835\uDC58, was defined using the rule: \uD835\uDC58 =\n⌈√\uD835\uDC5B/2⌉ , where \uD835\uDC5B denotes the number of available samples. The minimum number of data within a cluster, \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC50, was defined as: \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC50 = ⌊\uD835\uDC5B/\uD835\uDC58⌋. Regardless the selected data instances, at the end of the sampling process, an additional step includes all non-defaulted data entries within the sampling set.\nTable 4.5.

There was three major drawbacks: low feature quality, long execution times and hardware requirements. In particular, for the problem at hand low level features fail to appropriate describe the defected regions on the image. Also, SSL even for a small size image require the construction of large scale matrices, which is time consuming.

      "text" : "Civil infrastructures are progressively deteriorating (e.g. ageing, environmental factors), calling for inspection and assessment. Presently, structural tunnel inspection is predominantly performed through tunnel-wide visual observations by inspectors, who identify structural defects, rate them and then, based on their severity, categorize the liner. This visual inspection (VI) process is slow, labor intensive and subjective (depending on the experience and fatigue). Additionally, it occurs while working in an unpleasant environment and uncomfortable conditions (Yu et al., 2007). Moreover, the liner condition evaluation is empirical and incomplete and lacks any engineering analysis; it is therefore, unreliable.\nApproaches that utilize automated procedures for VI of concrete infrastructures aim specifically to defects detection and structure evaluation. Towards this direction, such methods exploit image processing and machine learning techniques. Initially, low-level image features are used towards the construction of complex handcrafted features, which are used to train learning models, i.e. the detection methods. Automated approaches have been applied in practical settings including roads, bridges, fatigues, and sewer-pipes (Kim and Haas, 2000; Sinha and Fieguth, 2006; Tung et al., 2002).\nRecent research in robotics and relevant sectors, such as computer vision and sensors, have significantly increased the competitiveness of components needed in automated systems. Such components can perform quick and robust inspection/assessment, in general transportation and tunnel infrastructures. However, such an integrated and automated system is not yet available. The work that will be presented in this chapter, involves the core mechanism of such system; a computer vision scheme, easy to integrate with all the required components (e.g. laser scanners) for the inspection and assessment of tunnels in one pass.\n37 Deep-learning, vision-based tunnel inspection\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

      "text" : "Intensity features and SVMs for crack detections on tunnel surfaces where used in (Liu et al., 2002). Color properties, different non-RGB color spaces and various machine learning algorithms are also investigated in (Son et al., 2012). Edge detection techniques are applied in (Abdel-Qader et al., 2003) for detecting concrete defects. Edge detection algorithms (i.e. Sobel and Laplacian operators) and graph based search algorithms are also utilized in (Yu et al., 2007) to extract crack information.\nAn image mosaic technology for detecting tunnels surface defects was further extended in (Mohanty and Wang, 2012). A pothole detection system (Koch and Brilakis, 2011), based on histogram shape-based thresholding and low level texture features, has been used in asphalt pavement images. A concrete spalling measurement system for post-earthquake safety assessments, using template matching techniques and morphological operations, has been proposed by (German et al., 2012).\nThe exploitation of more sophisticated features has also been proposed. Histograms of Oriented Gradient features and SVMs are utilized in the work of (Halfawy and Hengmeechai, 2014), to support automated detection and classification of pipe defects. Shape-based filtering is exploited in the work of (Jahanshahi et al., 2013) for crack detection and quantification. The constructed features are fed as input to ANN or SVM classifiers in order to discriminate crack from non-crack patterns.\nThe conventional paradigm of pattern recognition consists of two steps: complex handcrafted feature construction and classifiers training. However, variety in defect types makes difficult the feature construction/selection task. Deep learning models (Hinton et al., 2006; Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006) are a class of machines that can learn a hierarchy of features by building complex, high-level features from low-level ones, automating the process of feature construction for the problem at hand.\nThe work of (Makantasis et al., 2015a) exploits a CNN to hierarchically construct high-level features, describing\nthe defects, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that carries out the defect detection task in tunnels. Such an approach offers an automated feature extraction, adaptability to the defect type(s), and has no need for special set-up for the image acquisition. Nevertheless, there is a major drawback regarding the applicability in real life scenarios: resources spend for data annotation. Data annotation is a time consuming job that requires a human expert; it is therefore prone to segmentation errors.\nThe aforementioned approach has been further enriched by (Protopapadakis and Doulamis, 2015a); they incorporated a prior, image processing, detection mechanism, facilitating the initialization phase. Such mechanism stands as a simple detector and is only used at the beginning of the inspection. Possible defects are annotated and then validated by an expert; after validating few samples, the required training dataset for the deep learning approach has been formed. From this point onwards, a CNN is trained and, then, utilized for the rest of the inspection process.\nIn their most recent approach (Protopapadakis et al., 2016a) the same initialization mechanism, as in the previous paragraph. However, the CNN detector is directly utilized over raw data. These data are image patches, which allow us to bypass the low level feature extraction process, preserving from wrong feature selection adverse impact. Finally, since most of defects result in crack appearance, the CNN is specifically utilized for crack detection."

      "text" : "We consider the detection of concrete defects in tunnels using monocular camera's RGB images. Seen as an image segmentation problem, the detection of defects entails, to a great extent, the classification of each one of the pixels in the image into one of two classes; defection class and no defection class.\n38 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nClassification requires the description of pixels by a set of highly discriminative features that fuse visual and spatial information. However, the features extraction is inherently depended on the problem at hand. Such drawback can be eliminated through a hierarchical construction of complex, high-level features, following the deep learning paradigm. Concretely, a CNN is proposed for feature construction, followed by a MLP, which conducts the classification task. While visual information is derived using the RGB values of each pixel, spatial information is obtained by taking into consideration a neighborhood around each pixel.\nFusing spatial and visual information is aligned with the exploitation of CNNs, which, typically, handle 2D inputs. Instead of using as input to the network a single pixel \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66, located at (\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC66) point on image plane, we feed it with a patch centered at point (\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC66). Particularly, in order to classify a pixel \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 and successfully fuse visual and spatial information, we use a square patch of size \uD835\uDC60 × \uD835\uDC60 centered at pixel \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66.\nIf we denote as \uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 the class label of the pixel at location (\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC66) and as \uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 the patch centered at pixel \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66, then, we can form a dataset \uD835\uDC37 = {\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66, \uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66} for \uD835\uDC65 = 1, … , \uD835\uDC64 and \uD835\uDC66 = 1, … , ℎ; parameters \uD835\uDC64 and ℎ refer to image width and height respectively. Patch \uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 is 3D tensor, who is divided into \uD835\uDC50 matrices of dimensions \uD835\uDC60 × \uD835\uDC60 (2D inputs) which are fed as input into a CNN. Parameter \uD835\uDC50 refers to the channels of visual information, i.e. for a typical RGB image, \uD835\uDC50 = 3. Then, the CNN hierarchically builds high-level features that encode visual and spatial characteristics of pixel \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66.\nThe output of the CNN is sequentially connected with a MLP. Thus, obtained features are used as input by the MLP classifier, which is responsible for detecting defections. The overall architecture of the CNN is shown in Figure 5.1."

In other words, images should be taken from any angle and distance from the tunnel surfaces. However, even if we have the ideal conditions, during acquisition, the defect types make the problem increasingly difficult for the detection mechanism. The term \"defect\" can be interpreted in many ways; deformations, cracks, surface disintegration, and other defects are widely known and commonly appear.\nDiscreet, parallel cracks that look like tearing of the surface are caused by shrinkage while the concrete is still fresh, called plastic shrinkage cracks. Fine random cracks or fissures that may only be seen when the concrete is drying after being moistened are called crazing cracks. Cracking that occurs in a three-point pattern is generally caused by drying shrinkage. Large pattern cracking, called map-cracking, can be caused by alkali-\n39 Deep-learning, vision-based tunnel inspection\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nsilica reaction within the concrete. Structural failure cracking may look like many other types of cracking; however, in slabs they are often associated with subsequent elevation changes, where one side of the crack is be lower than the other.\nDisintegration of the surface is generally caused by three types of distress: (a) dusting, due to carbonation of the surface by unventilated heaters or by applying water during finishing, (b) ravelling or spalling at joints, when pieces of concrete from the joint edges are dislodged and, (c) breaking of pieces from the surface of the concrete, generally caused by delaminations and blistering. Popouts are conical fragments that come off the surface, typically leaving a broken aggregate at the bottom of the hole. Popoffs, or mortar flaking, is similar to popouts, except that the aggregate is not broken and the broken piece is generally smaller. Flaking of the concrete surface over a widespread area is called scaling.\nOther defects include discoloration of the concrete; bugholes, which are small voids in the surface of vertical concrete placements, and honeycombing, which is the presence of large voids in concrete caused by inadequate consolidation. At this point, we are able to understand the defect identification problem: it is\n40 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nextremely difficult to extract features suitable for the accurate description of such a large number of defect alternatives, simultaneously."

When it comes to smart monitoring of largescale enterprises or factories, the importance of behavior recognition relates to the safety and security of the staff, to the reduction of bad quality products cost, to production scheduling, as well as, to the quality of the production process.\nIn most approaches, the goal is either to detect activities, which may deviate from the norm, or to classify some isolated activities (Kim and Ling, 2009; Turaga et al., 2008). Modern techniques are based on supervised training, using large data sets (Kim et al., 2015). The need of a significant amount of labeled data during the training phase makes classifiers data expensive. In addition, that data demands an expert’s knowledge that increases further the cost.\nModern industry is based on the flexibility of production lines. Therefore, changes occur constantly. These changes call for appropriate modifications to the supervising systems. A considerable amount of new training paradigms is required in order to adjust the system (Bashir et al., 2007) at the new environment. In order to provide all the training data an expert, whose services will not be at a low-cost, is needed.\nA variety of methods has been used for event detection and especially human action recognition, including semi-latent topic models (Wang and Mori, 2009), spatial-temporal context (Hu et al., 2010), optical flow and kinematic features (Ali and Shah, 2010), and random trees and Hough transform voting (Yao et al., 2010). Comprehensive literature reviews regarding isolated human action recognition can be found in (Hu et al., 2004; Poppe, 2010).\nIn this chapter we focus on creating of a decision support mechanism for the workflow surveillance in an assembly line that would use few training data, initially; as time passes could be self-trained or, if it is necessary, ask for an expert assistance. That way, the human knowledge is incorporated at the minimum possible cost. The innovation can be summarized to the following sentence: We propose a cognitive system which is able to survey complex, non-stationary industrial processes by utilizing only a small number of training data and using a self-improvement technique through time.\n47 A hybrid, self-trained model for industrial workflow monitoring\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

The created histograms are fed as inputs to a non-linear classifier.\nThe heart of the system is the automatic self-improvable methodology of the classifier. In particular, we start feeding the classifier with a small but sufficient number of training samples (labeled data). Then, the classifier is tested on new incoming unlabeled data. If specific criteria are met, the classifier automatically selects suitable data from the set of the unlabeled data for further training. The criteria are set so that only the most confident unlabeled data will be used on the new training set.\nIf a vague output occurs, for any of the new incoming unlabeled data, a second classifier, which exploits similarity measure among the in-sampled and the unlabeled data, is used. If classifiers disagree, an expert is called to interweave at the system to improve the classifier accuracy.

A very positive attribute of such representations is that they can easily capture the history of a task that is being executed. These images can then transformed to a vector-based representation using the Zernike moments (Hwang and Kim, 2006), up to sixth order, in our case, as it was applied in (Kosmopoulos et al., 2011).\nThe video features, once exported, had a 2 dimensional matrix representation of the form m×l, where m denotes the size of the 1×m vectors created using Zernike moments, and l the number of such vectors.\n51 A hybrid, self-trained model for industrial workflow monitoring\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nAlthough m was constant, l varies according to the video duration. In order to create constant size histogram vectors, which would be the system’s inputs, the following steps took place:\n1. The hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transformation was applied to every video feature. As a result the prices\nof the 2-d matrices range from -1 to 1.\n2. Histogram vectors of 33 classes were created. The number of classes was defined after various\nsimulations. Higher number of classes leads to poor performance due to the small training sample (in our case 48 vectors). Fewer classes also caused poor performance probably due to loss of important information from the original features. Each class counts the frequency of the appearance of a value (within a specific range) for a particular video feature.\n3. Finally, each histogram vector value is normalized. Thus, the input vectors were created.\nIt is clear that each histogram vector describes a specific job among seven different. These histograms, one at a time, are the inputs for a feed forward neural network (FFNN). The target vectors are seven-element arrays. The value at each array will be either one or zero.

      "text" : "In order to understand the elderly fall problem, and try to prevent fall incidents, someone needs to examine where they occur. Recent studies show that 67% of fall incidents take place inside or in close proximity to patients' home and residential institutions (Government of Canada, 2014), where a medical alert system can be of immediate assistance. Taking into consideration the importance of humans' fall problem and the aforementioned statistics, the development of robust home surveillance systems is necessary. For this reason, a major research effort has been conducted in the recent years for automatically detecting persons' falls.\nOne common way for automatic fall detection is through the use of specialized devices, such as accelerometers, floor vibration sensors, barometric pressure sensors, gyroscopic sensors, or combination/fusion of them (Le and Pan, 2009; Nyan et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2005; Zigel et al., 2009) or help buttons. However, most of these techniques require specific wearable devices that should be attached to human body. Thus, their efficiency relies on the persons' ability and willingness to wear them. External sensors, such as floor vibration detectors, require a complex setup and are still in their infancy. In the case of a help button, it is useless, if the person is unconscious after the fall.\n56 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nA more challenging alternative is the use of visual cameras, like the system presented in this chapter, which is however a prime research issue due to the complexity of visual content, i.e. illumination variations, background changes and occlusions, and the fact that a fall incident should be discriminated over other ordinary humans' activities. The emergence of computer vision systems has allowed researchers to overcome the aforementioned problems. Vision based systems are less intrusive, can be installed on buildings and are not worn by users.\nFurthermore, cameras can provide a vast amount of information about person and environment making vision based systems suitable for different kind of applications, as they are able to detect several events simultaneously. For example, a vision based system can be used to detect fall incidents, while at the same time, is checking other daily life activities, like medication intake. Although, vision based systems can provide information about human activities, they can preserve persons' privacy by exploiting an event-based design that triggers alarms and/or enables video recording only after the occurrence of specific predefined events. A detailed survey of fall detection methodologies is presented in (Mubashir et al., 2013).\nCamera based approaches have also various limitations. Firstly, it is apparent that camera based falls detection is a more challenging process than using other types of sensors, due to occlusion issues, camera resolution, background clutter, visual complexity of the environment, etc. Secondly, camera positioning causes a lot of parallax problems that can affect falls' detection performance. Last but not least, privacy issues should be carefully examined."

Such approach allows fall detection in real-time and in dynamically changing visual conditions, achieving robustness, through camera calibration and inverse perspective mapping, exploiting 3D physical space's measures.\nThe fall detection scheme consists of a non Linear Warning System (nLWS), based on a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach. The nLWS utilizes neural networks that are topologically optimized through the use of an Island GA. Once the GA is completed using a small training sample, a self-training procedure is utilized, based on the cluster assumption. The methodology is similar to the work of (Protopapadakis et al., 2012).\nIn contrast to other 2D fall detection methods, the proposed system is very robust for a wider range of camera positions and mountings and its performance is not affected by the distance between camera and foreground object. Moreover, it extracts 3D features without using computationally expensive stereo-vision mathematics, which are necessary and compulsory for all multiple camera systems."

Additionally, the primary concern of a fall detection system is to achieve low false negative rates, i.e. its goal is to detect all fall incidents even if some of them are not true (false alarms).

All of them are calculated over the foreground pixels.

Additionally, In contrast to ordinary human activities, during which human posture changes slowly, during a fall human posture changes suddenly. On the one hand, human posture can be characterized by person's width-height ratio, and this is valid as this ratio is bigger in value when a fall event occurs than the same ratio\n60 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nwith the person in standing position, and on the other by the orientation of person's body (Foroughi et al., 2008).\nWidth-height ratio is determined by person's projected width and height. So, the first step for the computation of this ratio is the estimation of these two measures. Both of these measures can be estimated by the four corners of a minimum bounding box that includes the person. By using the four corners of the minimum bounding box the points \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC5A, \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC5A, \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC5A and \uD835\uDC5E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC5A, which correspond to foreground object's bottom-most, topmost, left-most and right-most points, can be obtained.

The approximation of such an ellipse requires to define its center (\uD835̅\uDC65, \uD835̅\uDC66) , its orientation, which is the angle \uD835\uDF19 of its major semi-axis and the lengths \uD835\uDC4E and \uD835\uDC4F of its major and minor semi-axes.\nAs described in (Foroughi et al., 2008), a bounding ellipse can be approximated by image moments. Having estimate the bounding box that contains a foreground object, as shown in (Spiliotis and Mertzios, 1998) the computational cost for computing image moments is linear to the number of foreground object pixels.

Its performance is affected by the quality of extracted features and subsequently by foreground extraction. For this reason, our system presents more robust performance for indoor environments.\nHowever, it should be mentioned that its performance is not affected by humans' height, because the threshold for discriminating fall incidents than normal activities, is estimated through a learning procedure and, thus, is adapted to individual's height. In addition, the impact of occlusions is being reduced as camera's height is being increased.\n61 Life quality improvement for elder people\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nFinally, in Table 7.2 false positive rates are presented with regard to different activities. The biggest false positive rate is presented when the human lies on the floor, however, this activity cannot be thought as \"normal\". False positive rates, associated with the \"lying on the floor\" activity, can decrease by relaxing vertical velocity threshold, used to discriminate fall incidents than normal activities. Relaxing this threshold, however, can increase false negative rates, which are of a primary concern for a fall detection system.\n62 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE"

Such systems vary from radar-based to video based. The former, however, has two major drawbacks (Zemmari et al., 2013); it is quite expensive and its performance is affected by various factors (e.g. echoes from targets out of interest). The latter, consists of various techniques, each one with specific advantages and drawbacks. The majority of such systems are controlled by humans, who are responsible for monitoring and evaluating numerous video feeds simultaneously.\nAdvanced surveillance systems should process and present collected sensor data, in an intelligent and meaningful way, to give a sufficient information support to human decision makers (Fischer and Bauer, 2010). The detection and tracking of vessels is inherently depended on dynamically varying visual conditions (e.g. varying lighting and reflections of sea). So, to successfully design a vision-based surveillance system, we have to carefully define both its operation requirements and vessels’ characteristics.\nOn the one hand there are minimum standards concerning operation requirements (Szpak and Tapamo, 2011). At first, it must determine possible targets within a scene containing a complex, moving background. Additionally, the system must not produce false negatives and keep as low as possible the number of false positives. Since we are talking about surveillance system, it must be fast and highly efficient, operating at a reasonable frame rate and for long time periods using a minimal number of scene related assumptions."

The system’s main purpose is to support end-user in monitoring coastlines, regardless of existing conditions.\nObject detection is a common approach with many variations; i.e. an-isotropic diffusion (Voles, 1999), which has high computational cost and per forms well only for horizontal and vertical edges, foreground object detection/image color segmentation fusion (Socek et al., 2005). In (Albrecht et al., 2011a; Albrecht et al., 2010) a maritime surveillance system mainly focuses on finding regions in images, where is a high likelihood of a vessel being present, is proposed. Such system was expanded by adding a sea/sky classification approach using HOG (Albrecht et al., 2011b). Vessel classes’ detection, using a trained set of MACH filters was proposed by (Rodriguez Sullivan and Shah, 2008).\nAll of the above approaches adopt offline learning methods that are sensitive to accumulation errors and difficult to generalize for various operational conditions. (Wijnhoven et al., 2010) utilized an online trained classifier, based on HOG. However, retraining takes place when a human user manually annotates the new training set. In (Szpak and Tapamo, 2011) an adaptive background subtraction technique is proposed for vessels extraction. Unfortunately, when a target is almost homogeneous is difficult, for the background model, to learn such environmental changes without misclassifying the target.\nMore recent approaches, using monocular video data, are the works (Makantasis et al., 2013) and (Kaimakis and Tsapatsoulis, 2013). The former, utilizes a fusion of Visual Attention Map (VAM) and background subtraction algorithm, based on Mixture of Gaussians (MOG), to produce a refined VAM. These features are fed to a neural network tracker, which is capable of online adaptation. The latter, utilized statistical modelling of the scene’s non-stationary background to detect targets implicitly.\nThe work of (Auslander et al., 2011) emphasize on algorithms that automatically learn anomaly detection models for maritime vessels, where the tracks are derived from ground-based optical video, and no domainspecific knowledge is employed. Some models can be created manually, by eliciting anomaly models in the form of rules from experts (Nilsson et al., 2008), but this may be impractical if experts are not available, cannot easily provide these models, or the elicitation cost may be high."

Firstly, a system needs to combine both supervised and unsupervised tracking techniques, in order to exploit all the possible advantages. Secondly, since we deal with vast amount of available data, we need to reduce, as much as possible, the required effort for the initialization of the system. The innovation of our approach lies in the creation of a visual detection system, able to overcome the aforementioned difficulties by combining various, well tested techniques and, at the same time, minimizes effort during the offline initialization using a Semi- Supervised Learning (SSL) technique, appropriate for large data sets.\nIn contrast to the approach of (Makantasis et al., 2013), the user has to roughly segment few images, i.e. use minimal effort, in order to create an initial training set. Such procedure is easily implemented using the suggested areas according to the unsupervised techniques’ results.

The significant amount of labelled data for the training process originates from the previously generated roughly segmented data sets. In order to facilitate the creation of such training set and further refine it (i.e. correct some user errors), SSL graph-based algorithms need to be involved. Unfortunately, SSL techniques scale badly as the available data rises. Consequently, a semi-supervised procedure, suitable for large data sets is exploited for the offline initialization, significantly reducing the effort required."

Towards this direction, an appearance-based approach is adopted to create visual attention maps that represent the probability of a target being present in the scene. High probability implies high confidence for a maritime target’s presence.\nVisual attention maps creation is based exclusively on each frame’s visual content, in relation to their surrounding regions or the entire image. Consequently, they do not take into consideration neither the temporal relationship between subsequent frames, nor any motion information presented in the scene. Due to this limitation, high probability is assigned, frequently, to image regions that depict non-maritime targets (e.g. stationary land parts). In order to overcome such drawback, our system exploits the temporal relationship between subsequent frames.\nConcretely, video blocks, containing a predefined number, ℎ, of frames and covering a time span, \uD835\uDC47, are used to model the pixels’ intensities. Thus, the temporal evolution of pixels intensities is utilized to estimate a pixelwise background model, capable to denote each one of the pixels of the scene as background or foreground. By using a background modelling algorithm, system can efficiently discriminate moving from stationary objects in the scene. In order to model pixels’ intensities, we use the background modelling algorithm presented in (Zivkovic, 2004).

As long as the camera is able to capture a vessel (i.e. spans an area of more than 40 pixels in the frame) the system will likely detect it, regardless the weather conditions (e.g. rain, fog, waves etc.).

In our approach, a Gaussian image pyramid is exploited in order to provide scale invariance and to take into consideration the relationship between adjacent pixels.\nThen, we have the traditional Low-level features analysis. As described in (Albrecht et al., 2011a, 2011b) different low-level image features respond to different attributes of potential maritime targets.

Thus, the training set \uD835\uDC46 can be transformed to:\n\uD835\uDC46 = {(\uD835\uDC87\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 (\uD835\uDC61), \uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC66 (\uD835\uDC61))} (8.7)\nHowever, human centric labeling, especially of large image data sets, is an arduous and inconsistent task, mainly due to the complexity of the visual content and the huge manual effort required. To overcome this drawback, we refine the initial training set through a semi-supervised approach. SSL allow the rough initial segmentation facilitating the expert and reducing the time required.\nIn order to refine the initial user-defined training set, we partition the set \uD835\uDC46 into two disjoint classes, \uD835\uDC45 and \uD835\uDC48. The class \uD835\uDC45 contains the most representative samples of \uD835\uDC46, i.e. the samples that can best describe the classes \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 and \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC35, while class \uD835\uDC48 contains the rest of the data. Samples of class \uD835\uDC45 are considered as labeled, while samples belonging to \uD835\uDC48 are considered as unlabeled. Then, via a semi-supervised approach the samples of \uD835\uDC45 are used for label propagation through the ambiguously labeled data of \uD835\uDC48. In the following we describe in detail the labeling process."

In our case \uD835\uDF07 is equal to 16, because the dimension of the space is equal to the dimension of the feature vectors that describe the pixels. The process for representatives selection is conducted twice, once for class \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 and once for \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC35. In the following, we describe the process for representative samples selection for one of the classes, let's say \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47. Exactly the same process is followed for selecting representatives for the other class.\nWe assume that the \uD835\uDF07 -dimensional volume formed by a simplex with vertices specified by the most representative points (pixels), belonging to class \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 , should be larger than that formed by any other combination of points of the same class. Let us denote as \uD835\uDF42(\uD835\uDC56) the \uD835\uDC56th representative sample, as \uD835\uDEFD the number of representatives to be generated, as \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45 = {\uD835\uDF42 (\uD835\uDC56), … , \uD835\uDF42(\uD835\uDEFD) } ⊆ CT the set that contains the representative samples and as vector \uD835\uDC98(\uD835\uDC57) = \uD835\uDF42(\uD835\uDC57) − \uD835\uDF42(\uD835\uDC56) for \uD835\uDC57 = 1, … , \uD835\uDEFD.

Initially the set \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45 is constructed by randomly selecting \uD835\uDEFD samples from set \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 and the volume of the simplex, formed by the elements of \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45, is calculated. Then, an iterative approach is adopted to test every sample in the set \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 as a candidate representative. Each one of the samples of \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45 is replaced, one at a time, with a sample \uD835̂\uDF42 from \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 that is being tested as candidate representative. Then, the algorithm evaluates if replacing any of the elements, of \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45 with the sample being tested, results in a larger simplex volume. If this is true, let's say for the point \uD835\uDC97(\uD835\uDC56) ∈ \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45, then the \uD835\uDC97 (\uD835\uDC57) point\n71 Maritime surveillance\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nis replaced by the image point \uD835̂\uDC97 and the process is repeated again until each one of the samples of \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 set is evaluated.\nThe selection method is scalable to large datasets, using an incremental approach. Let us assume that β representatives are known. Then, the problem of selecting \uD835\uDEFD + 1 representatives can be reduced to finding \uD835\uDEFD + 1 representatives given \uD835\uDEFD of them. This way, only the volumes of simplices formed by the elements of the sets \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47,\uD835\uDC45 ∪ \uD835\uDC99 (\uD835\uDC56) for \uD835\uDC99(\uD835\uDC56) ∈ \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 need to be evaluated."

The performance of each system's component have been checked separately; extracted features were evaluated in terms of discriminative ability and importance, semi-supervised labeling for the predicting outcome and, finally, the binary classifier for its performance.\nThe data sets describe real life scenarios, in various weather conditions. Data consists of recorded videos from cameras mounted at the Limassol port, Cyprus and Chania old port, Crete, Greece. Monocular cameras were recording videos streams depicting maritime traffic for over one year. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of the video frames, maritime targets are absent from the scene. In order to deal with such cases, we manually edited the videos and kept only the tracks that depict intrusion of one or more targets in the scene.

The ratio of the representative samples in relation with the ambiguously labeled samples is the only factor that affect the performance of labeling algorithm.\nAs shown in Figure 8.6, the labeling error is lower than 2% when the ratio of the representative samples in relation with the ambiguously labeled samples is over 40%. When the ratio is smaller than 40% the labeling error is linearly increasing and it reaches the value of 5.7% when the ratio of representative samples is 10%.\nThe choice for an appropriate value for the ratio of representatives is inherently dependent on the quality of human based labeling. If labeling is the result of a rough image segmentation, a lot of the labeled pixel will carry the wrong label. In such cases the aforementioned ratio must be set to a small value. The most representative samples from each class is assumed that carry the right label, while the labels of the rest of the samples must be reconsidered. In our case, we required the user to segment the frame in a very careful way, which implies that the vast majority of the pixels will carry the right label. For this reason we set the ratio value to 40%. The semi-supervised labeling algorithm with 40% of representatives is expected to re-label 1.7% of the samples.\n75 Maritime surveillance\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

      "text" : "Structures foundation in the form of concrete piles is a commonly adopted approach in many cases. These piles are usually built by using precast and cast-in-situ techniques. Sometimes, \"necks\" or \"bulbs\" may be created in the process of drilling. These defects may affect the bearing capacity of the piles. Hence the structural evaluation and monitoring of new and existing piles are becoming increasingly important. In this chapter we deal with the detection of such defects using a graph based approach. Piles’ surfaces’ oscillations, produced through numerical simulation, serve as row data for the detection mechanism.\nSurface oscillation is non-destructive testing (NDT) approach (Garnier et al., 2011), adopted for many practical reasons. The test is based on wave propagation theory; the impact generates a compression wave that travels down the pile at a constant wave speed. Changes in cross sectional area (e.g. reduction in diameter) produce wave reflections. Engineers would desire the use of an intelligent software tool, able to automatically analyze these complex waveforms generated as a result of a pile integrity test (PIT) testing and produce classification outputs, regarding piles’ condition states.\nTowards that direction, an innovative work for the NDT of piles is employed using a mixture of state of the art soft computing techniques, appropriate feature extraction and data generation procedures. Regarding the classification process, a graph based label propagation approach is adopted over a graph, which is constructed under SSL assumptions (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009b). The innovation of the current methodology is the fully automatic post processing technique, which results in high classification performance, easy implementation and noise tolerance, using a limited training sample.\nThe results have been obtained on experimental data originating from numerical experiments. These data, as described below, simulate as much as possible real-life phenomena of \"neck\" or \"bulb\" type structural defects. Application of novel intelligent classification algorithms for defects' prediction should be first experientially validated and tested under laboratory conditions to guarantee the successful performance of the classifier and then to be validated on real-data, which requires huge financial effort while it is also risky in such infrastructures.\n77 Non-destructive flaws detection in foundation piles\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

The work of (Huang and Ni, 2012) investigates the relative performance of the sonic echo (SE), impulse response (IR), and parallel seismic (PS) tests using a field constructed pile foundation incorporating simulated defects. The work of (Hola and Schabowicz, 2010) presents the state of the art approaches of NDT on building structures. Such studies suggest the NDT approach appropriateness.\nNumerical simulation of NDT cases (Haddad, 2010) is an alternative approach, which allow the investigation of various defect types, providing accurate results very close to real life situations. The work of (Huang et al., 2010) focuses on drilled shaft defects identification. Other approaches focuses on the testing conditions, such as the effects of the source on wave propagation (Chai et al., 2010). Generally, the quality of numerically generated waveforms is close to the actual ones. Thus, accurate interpretation of such waveforms could be extremely beneficial.\nThere are many methods for the analysis of such waveforms; artificial neural networks (ANNs) is a common one. Relating work on inverse analysis and defect identification problems solved by optimization and ANNs can be found in (Stavroulakis et al., 2003, 2004; Stavroulakis, 2000). Relative work can be, also, found in (Tam et al., 2004; Zhang and Zhang, 2009). These approaches exploit relatively simple ANN topologies, using a few selected inputs. Therefore, the users must have quite extended experience in order to choose the measurements to use, while the effectiveness of the neural network cannot be guaranteed or optimized."

Monitoring and analysis of these reflections form the basis of PIT (Schauer and Langer, 2012).\nIn our case similar tests, with the ones performed in the laboratories, are modelled by employing a coupled finite element method (FEM) together with scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) approach (Schauer et al., 2012). Numerical simulation is used for the data generation. Graph label propagation (Wang and Zhang, 2008) is, then, used for the defect identification.

Another possible limitation is the transductive nature of the approach; graph based approaches are unable to handle new data. In such case, we have to recreate the graph and all the corresponding matrices.\n84 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nThe proposed approach performs better than the other commonly used techniques. Compared to the ANN, harmonic function needs a considerably smaller amount of labeled data and requires less heuristic approaches for the best topology definition. Generally, ANN performance highly depends on various parameters regarding the detector structure, such as number of hidden layers, neurons and training epochs. Compared to the kNN, Harmonic function exploits additional information of the unlabeled data. Thus, as labels propagate, edges’ labels match the \uD835\uDC58 closest ones from the entire data space.\nResults suggest that bulb or neck cases are easily identifiable. However, normal radius is classified either as neck or bulb more frequently (see Figure 9.5). The misclassification of non-defective pile parts can be partially explain by the waveform, which has a specific form defined by the defect(s) type. Such form doesn’t change significantly if the defective pile part is followed by a non-defective part. Thus, we have a waveform, indicating a defect, crossing a non-defective part. According to the similarity mechanism of the proposed methodology, such form is more likely to indicate a defection, resulting in wrong classification. The misclassification rates grow as more defects appear in the same pile."

      "text" : "One method to assess the behavior of a pile is to apply non-destructive testing through the use of low strain integrity tests in time domain. The wave is generated by a hand held hammer blow impact and the response, as a function of time, is picked up by multiple accelerometers, placed on pile head and around it, on a circle base, close to the location of hammer blow. Then we need to apply signal processing methods on the waveforms generated in order to detect the defects.\nInitially, appropriate features were extracted in order to map piles' waveforms to meaningful short-length signals. Then, these features form a graph, where the labels propagate among the edges utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. The performed experiments provide very promising results; the defect recognition rate is above 80%, when z-axis observations are used. On the contrary, the performance based on x and y axes behavior patterns is severely low. The problem formulation can easily be expanded in piles with more divisions (i.e. more than 4) and varying defects' diameters. Although, a greater misclassification error is likely, as long as we deal with “neck” or “bulb” detection, the performance is expected to remain high.\nFinally, we observe that high detection rates are achievable using only a handful set of samples for training. The detection rates are also affected by the shape and the depth; deeper the defect harder to locate. Piles with more complex structure will be evaluated in future work. Furthermore, new adaptation strategies and detection techniques will be investigated to handle non-stationary waveforms cases.\n85 Image meta-filtering techniques in cultural heritage applications\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nChapter X: Adaptive Filtering in Accordance to User’s Needs\nIn the end, the character of a civilization is encased in its structures.

      "text" : "Cultural heritage (CH) digitization is a complex task that involves data retrieval and filtering from many alternative sources. Our work, described below, examines the filtering abilities of an innovative system (described below), over a given set of acquired images. The system exploits both user feedback and SSL assumptions, in order to capture the user’s needs and minimize annotation effort.\neffectiveness of any content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system (Valle and Cord, 2009) is severely depended on the selection of the appropriate distance metric. A common approach may involve, the well-known, Euclidean metric for computing distances between images, which are represented in some vector space. Unfortunately, such metric is often inadequate because of the well-known semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantic concepts (Datta et al., 2005).\nCurrently, there are many approaches trying to deal with the semantic gap (Kumar K. and Gopal, 2014; Tang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008). One of them is the user feedback, which may be inefficient or exhausting in large data bases. In addition, user’s needs change constantly, even over the same data base. In cultural heritage applications, there is always the need for data variations, especially when talking about 3D (Manferdini and Galassi, 2013) or 4D (Ioannides et al., 2013) reconstruction. Definitely, there are specific techniques to deal with the selection of appropriate images for reconstruction (e.g. (Konstantinos Makantasis et al., 2013)). Nevertheless, term “appropriate” is always defined by someone’s needs.\nUser’s needs or preferences may vary, from simple object detection (A. Doulamis, 2010; Lalos et al., 2014) (e.g. images of a specific statue), complex human motions (Doulamis, 2014) (e.g. images of children running around the fountain). Nowadays, such images, most likely, will be available given a large image data set retrieved from the internet using various techniques. However, it is very difficult, for the user, to search the entire data set, in order to select the specific images. In this chapter, we propose a suitable approach towards the retrieval of the appropriate images, given an initial data set, with respect to the user’s preferences.\n86 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE\nA mechanism that actuates over an initially retrieved set, given the user’s preferences, can be beneficial in many ways. At first, such mechanism allows data sets to be further enriched/modified a priori, by using state of the art techniques and thus exploiting existing knowledge. Secondly, the user can change the features utilized, by the filtering mechanism, at any time in order to get more personalized results. Thirdly it handles outliers; chances are that totally irrelevant images will be in the originally retrieved set. In that case, it is very likely to be detected, during representative objects selection, and excluded. Finally, the semi-supervised approach minimizes user’s feedback and, at the same time, captures current needs."

The reason behind the proposed mechanism lies in the need of multiple uses of the same data sets in different applications (e.g. subsets of the same data can be used for 3D reconstruction, tourism promotion, book publications, etc.).\nMeta-filtering creates an appropriate image ranking mechanism, according to the user’s requirements. The entire data set is presented to the user through few representative samples. The user has to annotate some of them, either as relevant or irrelevant to his current search. Then, in a fully automated way, an appropriate distance metric is calculated. Such metric is used by a ranking approach to assign a score for every image of the set. Images with high scores are presented to the user as the most relatives to his/her needs.\nAll the images of the set are employed to the calculation of the appropriate distance metric according to a graph based SSL scheme (a very common approach in SSL (Belkin et al., 2004; Goldberg et al., 2007; Goldberg and Zhu, 2006; Liu et al., 2010)). Thus, non-annotated images support the regularization creating a smooth distance metric (i.e. images with similar features will have similar ranking, given the user preferences as constraint).

Once the data set for a specific monument is gathered, additional features from the images are extracted.

The specific descriptors were chosen due to their simplicity and small size, high processing speed, robustness, scalability and interoperability (Serna et al., 2011).\nThe CLD is a very compact one that captures the spatial layout of dominant colors of an image with coefficients of the Discrete Cosine Transform. The SCD is derived from an HSV color histogram with fixed color quantization, and its coefficients are encoded through a Haar transformation, while the EHD is a texture descriptor that detects edges of different angles by dividing the image into smaller blocks.\n87 Image meta-filtering techniques in cultural heritage applications\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis"

At the same time, minor mistakes can be tolerated by the proposed systems.\nThe first approach is a hybrid, self-training approach for the industrial workflow recognition. The core mechanism is a topologically optimized feed forward neural network, created using less than 40% of the available data. Then, given new data the classifiers labels them and retrains itself using the most appropriate ones. In order to avoid labeling errors a secondary similarity based classifier is activated, when specific criteria are met. If classifiers did not agree, an expert was summoned via a feedback scheme.\nSea border surveillance is another vision based approach. In that case SSL was used exclusively for training data set creation purposes. The system utilizes a pixel level classification mechanism based on SVMs. In order to correct man made annotation mistakes, which could jeopardize the SVM classifier performance, the initial annotated image data set was re-annotated according to a scalable graph based SSL approach.\n95 Concluding remarks\nDECISION MAKING VIA SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES | Ph.D. Thesis\nElders’ falls detection is an important topic. In this case, the SSL techniques were used for both system initialization and adaptation. At first, under the cluster assumption, extracted feature vectors form two classes: fall and non-fall. Then the classifier is initialized and adopt to the new data using a self-training approach, similar to the industrial monitoring one, previously described. Despite being a vision based approach, no actual video over 3 seconds duration is recorded, preserving the people’s privacy.\nApplicability over extremely complex data cases was evaluated in tunnel surface defect identification scenarios. It is a typical two class identification problem; SSL approaches could not compete other state of the art techniques in detection performance neither for execution times. There was three major drawbacks: low feature quality, long execution times and hardware requirements. Deep learning hierarchical schemes (i.e. convolutional neural networks) detection abilities outperformed all other approaches.\nThe structural integrity of foundation piles was also evaluated using graph based approaches. Using wave propagation theory and noise modeling the entire set of foundation piles can be assessed simultaneously. In particular the similarity of the waveforms is projected in a nearest neighbor graph. Then, given the status of few piles, the information propagates through the edges to all connected nodes. The proposed approach reduces labeling effort, which is both costly and time consuming. Such an approach encourages the data sampling, since larger the data base better the classification accuracy.\nThe labeled data selection impact was evaluated, using data from the Greek commercial sector. A great variety of sampling approaches are used to evaluate the descriptive abilities of small training sets, given a classifier raging from traditional models, e.g. logistic regression, to advanced soft computing techniques, e.g. artificial neural networks. Simulation outcomes suggest that no optimal choice, regarding the data sampling, neither for the classification approach, exists.\nFinally, a novel idea for image meta-filtering is proposed. An appropriate distance metric is calculated via SSL assumptions which models user’s behavior over image selection. Such an approach allows multiple uses of the same data sets in different applications (e.g. subsets of the same data can be used for 3D reconstruction, tourism promotion, book publications, etc.). User’s feedback is involved only for a minor set of data. The proposed scheme facilitates the refinement of retrieval results always under the scope of the end user needs.\nExperimental outcomes are in accordance with existing literature suggestions: The unlabeled data can be used in order to improve models’ performance (i.e. accuracy, precision, etc.). Yet, there are no optimal solutions regarding the model and feature selection, nor for the data sampling techniques. Heuristic approaches or empiric rules are not always sufficient, although they provide a good starting point during the first stages of a DSS development.\nHowever, there is no “free-lunch”. In particular, in real applications the data abundance creates many implementation issues9; among them are the memory issue and the time issue. The former directly affects the scalability of the models in datasets with thousands of entries, although there are studies dealing with such an issue. The latter, limit the models applicability in on-line systems (e.g. pixels classification in video sequences). Finally, low feature quality can jeopardize models performance; in the SSL framework bad features result in even more severe performance loss. The model propagates the knowledge to new data and adapt itself to the new wrong labels.\nThe end.\n9 Generally speaking, since the SSL field spans a great variety of methodologies.\n96 Decision Making via Semi-Supervised Machine Learning Techniques\nEftychios Protopapadakis | TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF CRETE"
