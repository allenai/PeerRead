      "text" : "Ontological knowledge plays a key role for interoperability in the Semantic Web perspective. Nowadays, standard ontology markup languages are supported by well-founded semantics of Description Logics (DLs) together with a series of available automated reasoning services [1]. However, several tasks in an ontology life-cycle [2], such as their construction and/or integration, are still almost entirely delegated to knowledge engineers.\nIn the Semantic Web perspective, the construction of the knowledge bases should be supported by automated inductive inference services. The induction of structural knowledge like the T-box taxonomies is not new in machine learning, especially in the context of concept formation [3] where clusters of similar objects are aggregated in hierarchies according to heuristic criteria or similarity measures. Almost all of these methods apply to zero-order representations while, as mentioned above, ontologies are expressed through fragments of first-order logic. Yet, the problem of the induction of structural knowledge turns out to be hard in first-order logic or equivalent representations [4].\nIn Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) attempts have been made to extend relational learning techniques towards hybrid representations based on both clausal and description logics [5, 6, 7]. In order to cope with the problem complexity, these methods are based on a heuristic search and generally implement bottom-up algorithms that tend to induce overly specific concept definitions which may suffer for poor predictive capabilities.\nSo far, the automated induction of knowledge bases expressed in DLs representations has not been investigated in depth. Classic approaches to learning\nDL concept definitions generally adopt heuristic search strategies to cope with the inherent complexity of the problem and generally implement bottom-up algorithms (e.g. [8]). Other approaches propose a top-down search for correct concept definitions [9]. These methods are not completely operational: since refinement operators compute short moves in a vast space of candidate definitions, they become useless when disjoined from proper heuristics based on the available assertions. A more knowledge-intensive method is to be preferred.\nIn this perspective, we introduce a novel similarity measure between concept descriptions based on semantics, which is suitable for expressive DLs like ALC [10, 1]. Since a merely syntactic approach has proven too weak to enforce standard inferences (namely subsumption), when expressive DLs are taken into account a different approach (based on semantics) is necessary. Also a similarity measure, then, should be founded on the underlying semantics, rather than on the syntactic structure of concept descriptions. Besides measuring the similarity of two concept descriptions, we propose a manner based on notion of most specific concept of an individual [1] for employing the same measure for the individual-concept and individual-individual similarity cases.\nSuch a measure can be the basis for adapting an existing clustering method to this representation (or devising a new one) operating in a top-down (partitional) or bottom-up (agglomerative) fashion. Moreover, the similarity measure can be also employed for Information Retrieval or Information Integration purposes applied to DL knowledge bases and also for Case-based Reasoning systems (see the next section).\nAs discussed in the following, the method can effectively compute the similarity measure with a complexity which depends on the complexity of standard inferences as a baseline. The applicability of this has been tested on examples which have been artificially generated from OWL1 ontologies. Some of these test examples are reported in this paper.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews related work on similarity measures. In Sect. 3 the representation language is presented. The similarity measure is illustrated in Sect. 4 and is discussed in Sect. 5. Possible developments of the method are examined in Sect. 6."

      "text" : "Similarity measure play an important role in information retrieval and information integration. Recent investigations in these fields have emphasized the use of ontologies and semantic similarity functions as a mechanism for comparing concepts and/or concept instances that can be retrieved or integrated across heterogeneous repositories [11, 12, 13, 14].\nSemantic similarity is typically determined as a function of the path distance between terms in the hierarchical structure underlying the ontology [15, 16, 17]. Other methods to assess semantic similarity within a single ontology are feature\n1 http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref\nmatching [19] and information content [13, 20]. The former approach uses both common and discriminant features among concepts and/or concept instances in order to compute the semantic similarity. The latter methods are founded on Information Theory. They define a similarity measure between two concepts within a concept hierarchy in terms of the amount of information conveyed by the immediate super-concept that subsumes two concepts being compared. This is a measure of the variation of information crossing from a description level to a more general one.\nA recent work [21] presents a number of measures for comparing concepts located in different and possibly heterogeneous ontologies. The following requirements are made for this measure:\n– the formal representation supports inferences such as subsumption; – local concepts in different ontologies inherit their definitional structure from\nconcepts in a shared ontology.\nThis study assumes that the intersection of sets of concept instances is an indication of the correspondence between these concepts. Three main types of measures for comparing concept descriptions are discussed in this work:\n1. filter measures based on a path-distance 2. matching measures based on graph matching establish one-to-one correspondence between elements of the concept descriptions, and 3. probabilistic measures that give the correspondence in terms of the joint distribution of concepts.\nOther similarity measures have been developed to compute similarity values among classes belonging to different ontologies. These measures are able to take into account the difference in the levels of explicitness and formalization of the different ontology specifications. Particularly, in [22] a similarity function determines similar entity classes by using a matching process making use of synonym sets, semantic neighborhood, and discriminating features that are classified into parts, functions, and attributes.\nAnother approach [23], aimed at finding commonalities among concepts or among assertions, employs the Least Specific Concept operator (LCS [1]) that computes the most specific generalization of the input concepts (with respect to subsumption, see the next section for a formal definition). This approach is generally intended for information retrieval purposes. Considered a knowledge base and a query concept, a filter mechanism selects another concept from the knowledge base that is relevant for the query concept. Then the LCS of the two concepts is computed and finally all concepts subsumed by the LCS are returned.\nMost of the cited works adopt a semantic approach in conjunction with the structure of the considered concept descriptions. Thus, they are liable to the phenomenon of the rapid growth of the description granularity. Besides the syntactic structure of concept descriptions becomes much less important when richer DL\nrepresentations are adopted due to the expressive operators that can be employed. For these reasons, we have decided to focus our attention to a measure which is totally based on semantics."

      "text" : "In relational learning, several solutions have been proposed for the adoption of an expressive fragment of first-order logic endowed with efficient inference procedures. Alternatively, the data model of a knowledge base can be expressed by means of DL concept languages which are empowered with precise semantics and effective inference services [1]. Besides, most of the ontology markup languages for the Semantic Web (e.g., OWL) are founded in Description Logics: representation languages borrow and implement the typical constructors of the DL languages.\nAlthough it can be assumed that annotations and conceptual models are maintained and transported using the XML-based languages mentioned above, the syntax of the representation adopted here is taken from the standard constructors proposed in the DL literature [1]. These DL representations turn out to be both sufficiently expressive and efficient from an inferential viewpoint.\nIn this section we recall syntax and semantics for the reference representation ALC [10] which is adopted in the rest paper for it turns out to be sufficiently expressive to support most of the principal constructors of an ontology markup language for the Semantic Web.\nIn a DL language, primitive concepts, denoted with names taken from NC = {C,D, . . .}, are interpreted as subsets of a certain domain of objects (resources) or equivantly as unary relation on such domain and primitive roles, denoted with names taken from NR = {R,S, . . .}, are interpreted as binary relations on such a domain (properties). Complex concept descriptions can be built using primitive concepts and roles by means of the constructors in Table 1. Their semantics is defined by an interpretation I = (∆I , ·I), where ∆I is the domain of the interpretation and the functor ·I stands for the interpretation function, mapping the intension of concepts and roles to their extension.\nA knowledge base K = 〈T ,A〉 contains two components: A T-box T and an A-box A. T is a set of concept definitions C ≡ D, meaning CI = DI , where C is the concept name and D is a description given in terms of the language constructors. A contains extensional assertions on concepts and roles, e.g. C(a) and R(a, b), meaning, respectively, that aI ∈ CI and (aI , bI) ∈ RI ; C(a) and R(a, b) are said respectively instance of the concept C and instance of the role R, more generally it is said (without loss of generality) that the individual a is instance of the concept C and the same for the role. A notion of subsumption between concepts is given in terms of the interpretations:\nDefinition 3.1 (subsumption). Given two concept descriptions C and D, C subsumes D, denoted by C ⊒ D, iff for every interpretation I it holds that CI ⊇ DI.\nAxioms based on subsumption (C ⊒ D) are generally also allowed in the T-boxes as partial definitions. Indeed, C ≡ D amounts to C ⊒ D and D ⊒ C.\nExample 3.1. An instance of concept definition in the proposed language is:\nFather ≡ Male ⊓ ∃hasChild.Person\nwhich corresponds to the sentence: ”a father is a male (person) that has some persons as his children”.\nThe following are instances of simple assertions:\nMale(Leonardo), Male(Vito), hasChild(Leonardo,Vito).\nSupposing that Male ⊑ Person is known (in the T-Box), one can deduce that: Person(Leonardo), Person(Vito) and then Father(Leonardo).\nGiven these primitive concepts and roles, it is possible to define many other related concepts:\nParent ≡ Person ⊓ ∃hasChild.Person\nand\nFatherWithoutSons ≡ Male ⊓ ∃hasChild.Person ⊓ ∀hasChild.(¬Male)\nIt is easy to see that the following relationships hold: Parent ⊒ Father and Father ⊒ FatherWithoutSons. ⊓⊔\nEspecially for rich DL languages such as ALC, many semantically equivalent (yet syntactically different) descriptions can be given for the same concept, which is the reason for preferring employing semantic approaches to reasoning over structural ones. Nevertheless equivalent concepts can be reduced to a normal form by means of rewriting rules that preserve their equivalence, such as: ∀R.C1 ⊓ ∀R.C2 ≡ ∀R.(C1 ⊓ C2) (see [1] for issues related to normalization and simplification).\nOne of the most important inference services from the inductive learning viewpoint is instance checking, that is deciding whether an individual is an instance of a concept (w.r.t. an A-Box). Related to this problem, it is often necessary to solve the realization problem that requires to compute, given an A-Box and an individual the concepts which the individual belongs to:\nDefinition 3.2 (Most Specific Concept). Given an A-Box A and an individual a, the most specific concept of a w.r.t. A is the concept C, denoted MSCA(a), such that A |= C(a) and ∀D such that A |= D(a), it holds: C ⊑ D.\nwhere |= stands for the standard semantic deduction [24]. In the general case of a cyclic A-Box expressed in a an expressive DL endowed with existential or numeric restriction the MSC cannot be expressed as a finite concept description [1], thus it can only be approximated.\nSince the existence of the MSC for an individual w.r.t. an A-Box is not guaranteed or it is difficult to compute, generally an approximation of the MSC is considered up to a certain depth k. The maximum depth k has been shown to correspond to the depth of the considered A-Box, as defined in [23].\nHenceforth we will indicate generically an approximation to the maximum depth with MSC∗."

      "text" : "In this section we present a similarity measure which is able to assess the similarity between instances or between instance and concept or even between concepts expressed in Description Logic and in particular in the ALC logic. We call such elements generically objects. Then we will formalize the measure for the various object types. The presented measure employs the basic set theory. It is mainly founded on the commonality among objects. Particularly, the base criterion for this measure is: the similarity value between objects is not only the result of the common features, but also the result of the different characteristics too. This criterion is in agreement with an information-theoretic definition of similarity [25]."

      "text" : "Let C and D two concepts description in a T-Box, expressed in the ALC logic. Now recall that through the instance checking service it is possible to determine the set of all individuals of a given A-Box that are instances of a certain concept. Let CI and DI be, respectively, the extensions of the concepts C and D respectively. By Def. 3.1, D subsumes C (written C ⊑ D) if the set of individuals that are instances of C is contained in the set of individuals that are instances of D, in other words if CI ⊆ DI . Here we refer to the canonical interpretation of the A-Box and the unique names assumption (UNA) is made: constants in the A-Box are interpreted as themselves and different names for individuals stand for different domain objects (canonical interpretation).\nSubsumption is a semantic relationship which induces an order over the space of concept descriptions: if C ⊑ D then D is more general that C or equivalently then C is more specific then D. Based on subsumption and set theory, we define a semantic similarity measure:\nDefinition 4.1 (Semantic Similarity Measure). Let L be the set of all concepts in ALC and let A be an A-Box with canonical interpretation I. The Semantic Similarity Measure s is a function\ns : L × L 7→ [0, 1]\ndefined as follows:\ns(C,D) = |II |\n|CI |+ |DI | − |II | ·max(|II |/|CI |, |II |/|DI |)\nwhere I = C ⊓D and (·)I computes the concept extension wrt the interpretation I.\nThe measure can be briefly justified as follows. In case of semantic equivalence of the input concepts (C ⊑ D and D ⊑ C), the maximum value of the similarity is assigned.\nIn case of disjunction, the minimum value of similarity is assigned because the two concepts are totally different: their extensions do not overlap. Indeed, they are semantically unrelated with respect to the generalization order: their intersection amounts to the bottom concept.\nIn case of overlapping concepts, a value in the range ]0, 1[ is computed. It expresses the similarity between the two concepts (represented by the factor |II |/(|CI | + |DI | − |II |)) reduced by a quantity (max(|II |/|CI |, |II |/|DI |)) which represents the major incidence of the intersection with respect to either concept. This means considering similarity not as an absolute value but as weighted with respect to a degree of non-similarity. Indeed, the higher such factor is the more one of the concepts is likely to be subsumed by the other. This is in accordance to the strong semantic relation between the concepts ensured by subsumption.\nExample 4.1.

      "text" : "First of all it is important to note that, differently from previously proposed similarity measures (see Sect. 2), this measure is totally semantic. Indeed, it uses only semantic inferences like instance checking (to solve the retrieval problem [1], that amounts to computing the extension of a concept given an A-Box); it does not make use of the syntactic structure of the concept description, thus it is independent from the granularity level of descriptions. This fact reflects the intrinsic complexity of expressive DL languages like ALC for which a structural approach to reasoning is simply ineffective (subsumption is computed using a tableaux rather than a structural algorithm). Therefore, the definition of s employs set theory and semantic services, so it make use of numeric approach despite its application on a symbolic DL representation.\nOur similarity measure has been applied on knowledge base written using the ALC logic. However, for the reasons mentioned above, it is important to note that s is applicable to any DL endowed with the basic reasoning services required by its definitions, namely: instance checking and MSC (approximation).\nSimilarity measures turn out to be useful in several applications and for many tasks such as commonality-based information retrieval in the context of a terminological knowledge representation system (which is a relatively new application context [23]), realization of semantic search engine, classification, case-based reasoning, clustering.\nThis last task is our goal. In particular, having defined a measure that is applicable both between concepts and between individuals and between concept and individuals, it is suitable for agglomerative clustering and for divisional clustering too. However we have noticed that s measure is suitable for measuring similarity between concepts but it presents some problem in case of individuals. This is due to the use of the individual’s MSC (approximation) which often turn out to be so specific that its extension likely includes only the considered individual; this phenomenon consequently provokes a totally dissimilarity value even if the individuals semantically express similar underlying concepts. So now we are investigating ways to overcome this limitation.\nBelow we prove that the function s presented is really a similarity measure and discuss the complexity issues related to its computation."

Let E be a set of elements among which a similarity measure has to be defined. A similarity measure E is a realvalued function d defined on the set E × E that fulfills the following properties:\n1. f(a, b) ≥ 0 ∀a, b ∈ E (positive definiteness) 2. f(a, b) = f(b, a) ∀a, b ∈ E (symmetry) 3. ∀a, b ∈ E : f(a, b) ≤ f(a, a)\n¿From the definition given in the previous section it is straightforward to prove that s satisfies the first property because s has value in the real interval [0, 1]. Then, as previously said, s assigns the maximum value when the concepts subsume each other; this last is the condition of equality of concept, so the third property is satisfied too. The property of symmetry is also trivially verified. Indeed set intersection, sum, product and maximum are commutative. It is straightforward to note that given two concepts C and D, it holds that:\ns(C,D) = |I I | |CI |+|DI |−|II| ·max( |II | |CI| , |II | |DI | ) =\n|II | |DI |+|CI |−|II| ·max( |II | |DI | , |II | |CI | ) = s(D,C)\nnote that I remains the same because of the commutativity of intersection."

Similarity between an individual and a concept: in this case, besides of the instance checking operations required by the previous case, the MSC approximation of the considered individual is to be computed. Thus, denoted with C(MSC∗) the complexity of the MSC approximation, it holds that:\nC(s) = C(MSC∗) + 3 · C(IC)\nSimilarity between individuals: this case is analogous to the previous one, the only difference is that now two MSC∗ approximations are to be computed for the arguments. So the complexity in this case is:\nC(s) = 2 · C(MSC∗) + 3 · C(IC)\nAs clearly shown by these formulæ, the measure complexity is sensible to the choice of the reference DL. For instance, for the ALC logic, C(IC) is PSPACE (see [1], Ch. 3).

In particular, we are addressing our research on the tuning of a semantic operator for the generalization of the approximated MSC obtained.
