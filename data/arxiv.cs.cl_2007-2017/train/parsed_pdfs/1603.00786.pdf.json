      "text" : "Entity mention detection, and more specifically named entity recognition (NER) (Collins and Singer, 1999; McCallum and Li, 2003; Nadeau and Sekine, 2007; Jin and Chen, 2008; He et al., 2012), has become a popular task for social media analysis (Finin et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2011; Fromreide et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012a). Many downstream applications that use social media, such as relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) and entity linking (Dredze et al., 2010; Ratinov et al., 2011), rely on first identifying mentions of entities. Not surprisingly, accuracy of NER systems in social media trails state-of-the-art systems for news text and\nother formal domains. While this gap is shrinking in English (Ritter et al., 2011; Cherry and Guo, 2015), it remains large in other languages, such as Chinese (Peng and Dredze, 2015; Fu et al., 2015).\nOne reason for this gap is the lack of robust up-stream NLP systems that provide useful features for NER, such as part-of-speech tagging or chunking. Ritter et al. (2011) annotated Twitter data for these systems to improve a Twitter NER tagger, however, these systems do not exist for social media in most languages. Another approach has been that of Cherry and Guo (2015) and Peng and Dredze (2015), who relied on training unsupervised lexical embeddings in place of these upstream systems and achieved state-of-the-art results for English and Chinese social media, respectively. The same approach was also found helpful for NER in the news domain (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Passos et al., 2014)\nIn Asian languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean, word segmentation is a critical first step (Gao et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2006; Mao et al., 2008). Peng and Dredze (2015) showed the value of word segmentation to Chinese NER in social media by using character positional embeddings.\nIn this paper, we investigate better ways to incorporate word boundary information into an NER system for Chinese social media. We combine state-of-the-art Chinese word segmentation (Chen et al., 2015) with the best Chinese social media NER system (Peng and Dredze, 2015). Since both systems used learned representations, we propose an integrated model that allows for joint training of learned representations, providing more information to the NER system about what is learned from word segmentation, as compared to features based on segmentation output. Our integrated model achieves nearly a 5% absolute improvement over the previous best results on both NER and nominal mention for Chinese social media. ar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n00 78\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n6"

We begin with a brief review of each system."

      "heading" : "2.1 LSTM for Word Segmentation",
      "text" : "Chen et al. (2015) proposed a single layer, left to right LSTM for Chinese word segmentation. An LSTM is a recurrent neural network (RNN) which uses a series of gates (input, forget and output gate) to control how memory is propagated in the hidden states of the model. For the Chinese word segmentation task, each Chinese character is initialized as a d dimensional vector, which the LSTM will modify during its training. Besides, For each input character, the model learns a hidden vector h. These vectors are then used with a biased-linear transformation to predict the output labels, which in this case are Begin, Inside, End, and Singleton. A prediction for position t is given as:\ny(t) = Woh (t) + bo (1)\nwhere Wo are the transformation parameters, bo the bias parameter, and h(t) the hidden state at position t. To model the tag dependencies, they introduced the transition scoreAij to measure the probability of jumping from tag i ∈ T to tag j ∈ T .\nWe used the same model as Chen et al. (2015) trained on the same data (segmented Chinese news article) We employed a different training objective. Chen et al. (2015) employed a maxmargin, however, while they found this objective yielded better results, we observed that maximumlikelihood yielded better segmentation results in our experiments1. Additionally, we sought to integrate their model with a log-bilinear CRF, which uses a maximum-likelihood training objective. For consistency, we trained the LSTM with a maximum-likelihood training objective as well.\n1We were unable to match the results reported by Chen et al. (2015). Our implementation achieved nearly identical results on development data (as inferred from their published figure), but lagged in test accuracy by 2.4%. Conversations with the authors strongly points to differences in data preprocessing, which can have a big impact on system accuracy. However, we were unable to conduct the same data preprocessing due to some unpublished resources, and we note that better pre-processing for segmentation is not a key point for this paper.\nThe maximum-likelihood CRF objective function for predicting segmentations is:\nLs(ys;xs,Θ) = 1\nK ∑ k [ log 1 Z(xs)k\n+ ∑ i ( Ts(y k i−1, y k i ) + s(y k i ;x k s ,Λs) ) ] (2) Example pairs (ys,xs) are word segmented sentences, k indexes examples, and i indexes positions in examples. Ts(yki−1, y k i ) are standard transition probabilities learned by the CRF2. The LSTM parameters Λs are used to produce s(yki ;x k s ,Λs), the emission probability of the label at position i for input sentence k, which is obtained by taking a soft-max of (1). We use a firstorder Markov model."

      "text" : "Peng and Dredze (2015) proposed a log-bilinear model for Chinese social media NER. They used standard NER features along with additional features based on lexical embeddings. By fine-tuning these embeddings, and jointly training them with a word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) objective, the resulting model is log-bilinear.\nTypical lexical embeddings provide a single embedding vector for each word type. However, Chinese text is not word segmented, making the mapping between input to embedding vector unclear. Peng and Dredze (2015) explored several types of representations for Chinese, including pre-segmenting the input to obtain words, using character embeddings, and a combined approach that learned embeddings for characters based on their position in the word. This final representation yielded the largest improvements.\nWe use the same idea but augmented it with LSTM learned representations, and we enables interaction between the CRF and the LSTM parameters. More details are described in (§2.3)."

      "heading" : "2.3 Using Segmentation Representations to Improve NER",
      "text" : "The improvements provided by character position embeddings demonstrated by Peng and Dredze (2015) indicates that word segmentation information can be helpful for NER. Embeddings aside, a simple way to include this information in an NER system would be to add features to the CRF using the predicted segmentation labels as features.\n2The same functionality as Aij in Chen et al. (2015) model.\nHowever, these features alone may overlook useful information from the segmentation model. Previous work showed that jointly learning different stages of the NLP pipeline helped for Chinese (Liu et al., 2012b; Zheng et al., 2013). We thus seek approaches for deeper interaction between word segmentation and NER. The LSTM word segmentation learns two different types of representations: 1) embeddings for each characters and 2) hidden vectors for predicting segmentation tags. Compressing these rich representations down to a small feature set imposes a bottleneck on using richer segmentation related information for NER. We experiment with including both of these information sources directly into the NER model.\nSince the log-bilinear CRF already supports joint training of lexical embeddings, we can also incorporate the LSTM output hidden vectors as dynamic features using a joint objective function.\nFirst, we augment the CRF with the LSTM parameters as follows:\nLn(yn;xn,Θ) = 1\nK ∑ k [ log\n1\nZ(xn)k + ∑ j ΛjFj(y k n,x k n, ew,hw) ] ,\n(3)\nwhere k indexes instances, j positions, and\nFj(y k,xk, ew,hw) = n∑ i=1 fj(y k i−1, y k i ,x k, ew,hw, i)\nrepresents the feature functions. These features now depend on the embeddings learned by the LSTM (ew) and the LSTM’s output hidden vectors (hw). Note that by including hw alone we create a dependence on all LSTM parameters on which the hidden states depend (i.e. the weight matrixes). We experiment with including input embeddings and output hidden vectors independently, as well as both parameters together.\nJoint Training In our integrated model, the LSTM parameters are used for both predicting word segmentations and NER. Therefore, we consider a joint training scheme. We maximize a (weighted) joint objective:\nLjoint(Θ) = λLs(ys;xs,Θ) + Ln(yn;xn,Θ) (4)\nwhere λ trades off between better segmentations or better NER, and Θ includes all parameters used in both models. Since we are interested in improving NER we consider settings with λ < 1."

      "heading" : "3 Parameter Estimation",
      "text" : "We train all of our models using stochastic gradient descent (SGD.) We train for up to 30 epochs, stopping when NER results converged on dev data. We use a separate learning rate for each part of the joint objective, with a schedule that decays the learning rate by half if dev results do not improve after 5 consecutive epochs. Dropout is introduced in the input layer of LSTM following Chen et al. (2015). We optimize two hyper-parameters using held out dev data: the joint coefficient λ in the interval [0.5, 1] and the dropout rate in the interval [0, 0.5]. All other hyper-parameters were set to the values given by Chen et al. (2015) for the LSTM and Peng and Dredze (2015) for the CRF.\nWe train the joint model using an alternating optimization strategy. Since the segmentation dataset is significantly larger than the NER dataset, we subsample the former at each iteration to be the same size as the NER training data, with different subsamples in each iteration. We found subsampling critical and it significantly reduced training time and allowed us to better explore the hyperparameter space.\nWe initialized LSTM input embeddings with pre-trained character-positional embeddings trained on 112,971,734 Weibo messages to initialize the input embeddings for LSTM. We used word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) with the same parameter settings as Peng and Dredze (2015) to pre-train the embeddings."

We did not apply any special preprocessing.\nNER This dataset contains 1,890 Sina Weibo messages annotated with four entity types (person, organization, location and geo-political entity), including named and nominal mentions.

The hyper-parameters are tuned on dev data and then applied on test. We now explain the results.\nWe begin by establishing a CRF baseline (#1) and show that adding segmentation features helps (#2). However, adding those features to the full model (with embeddings) in Peng and Dredze (2015) (#3) did not improve results (#4). This is probably because the character-positional embeddings already carry segmentation information. Replacing the character-positional embeddings with character embeddings (#5) gets worse results but benefits from adding segmentation features (#6). This demonstrates both that word segmentation helps and that character-positional embeddings effectively convey word boundary information.\nWe now consider our model of jointly train the character embeddings (#9), the LSTM hidden vectors (#10) and both (#11). They all improve over the best published results (#3). Jointly train the LSTM hidden vectors (#10) does better than the embeddings (#9) probably because they carry richer word boundary information. Using both representations achieves the single best result (#11): 4.3% improvement on named and 5.3% improvement on nominal mentions.\nFinally, we examine how much of the gain is from joint training versus from pre-trained segmentation representations. We first train an LSTM for word segmentation, then use the trained embeddings and hidden vectors as inputs to the logbilinear CRF model for NER, and fine tunes these representations. This (#7) improved test F1 by 2%, about half of the overall improvements from joint training."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "Different interpretations of our results suggest directions for future work.\nFirst, we can view our method as multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Collobert and Weston, 2008), where we are using the same learned representations (embeddings and hidden vectors) for two tasks: segmentation and NER, which use different prediction and decoding layers. Result #8 shows the result of excluding the additional NER features and just sharing jointly trained LSTM. While this does not perform as well as adding the additional NER features (#11), it is impressive that this simple architecture achieved similar F1 as the best results in Peng and Dredze (2015). While we may expect both NER and word segmentation results to improve, we found the segmentation performances of the best joint model tuned for NER lose to the stand alone word segmentation model (F1 90.7% v.s. 93.3%). This lies in the fact that tuning λ means choosing between the two tasks; no single setting achieved improvements for both, which suggests further work is needed on better model structures and learning.\nSecond, our segmentation data is from the news domain, whereas the NER data is from social media. While it is well known that segmentation systems trained on news do worse on social media (Duan et al., 2012), we still show large improvements in applying our model to these different domains. It may be that we are able to obtain better results in the case of domain mismatch because we integrate the representations of the LSTM model directly into our CRF, as opposed to only using the predictions of the LSTM segmentation model. We plan to consider expanding our model to explicitly include domain adaptation mechanisms (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015)."

For languages where word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is a key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word boundary tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying these boundaries may provide richer information for an NER system. New state-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn representations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant improvements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly training NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5% absolute improvement over previously published results.",
