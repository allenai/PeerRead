      "text" : "Image colorization assigns a color to each pixel of a target grayscale image. Early colorization methods [Levin et al., 2004; Qu et al., 2006] require users to provide considerable scribbles on the grayscale image, which is apparently timeconsuming and requires specialties. Later research provides more automatic colorization methods. Those colorization algorithms differ in the ways of how they model the correspondence between grayscale and color.\nGiven an input grayscale image, non-parametric methods first define one or more color reference images (provided by human or retrieved automatically) to be used as source data. Then, following the Image Analogies framework [Hertzmann et al., 2001], the color is transferred onto the input image from analogous regions of the reference image(s) [Welsh et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2012; Chia et al., 2011]. Parametric methods, on the other hand, learn prediction functions from large datasets of color images in the training stage, posing the colorization problem as either regression in the continuous color space [Cheng et al., 2015; Deshpande et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016] or classification of quantized color values [Charpiat et al., 2008].\nWhichever seeking the reference images or learning a color prediction model, all above methods share a common goal, i.e. to provide a colored image closer to the original one. But as we know, many colors share the same gray value. Purely from a grayscale image, one cannot tell what color of clothes the girl is wearing or what color the bedroom wall is. Those methods all produce a deterministic mapping function, thus when an item could have diverse colors, their models tend to provide a weighted average brownish color as pointed out in [Koo, 2016].\nIn this paper, to avoid this sepia-toned colorization, we use conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate diverse colorizations for a single grayscale image while maintaining their reality. GAN is originally proposed by [Goodfellow et al., 2014] and is composed of two adversarial parts: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates reality probability of a real or generated sample. Unlike many other conditional GANs like [Isola et al., 2016] using convolution layers as encoder and deconvolution layers as decoder, we build a fully convolutional generator and each convolutional layer is splinted by a concatenate layer to continuously render the conditional grayscale information and a batch normalization layer to provide internal covariate shift. Additionally, to maintain the spatial information, we set all convolution stride to 1 to avoid downsizing data. We also concatenate noise channels to first half convolutional layers of the generator to attain more diversity in the colored image generation process. As the generator G would capture the color distribution, we can alter the colorization result by changing the input noise. Thus we no longer need to train an additional independent model for each color scheme like [Cheng et al., 2015].\nAs our goal alters from producing the original colors to producing realistic diverse colors, we conduct questionnaire surveys as a Turing test instead of calculating the root mean squared error (RMSE) comparing the original image to measure our colorization result. The feedback from 80 subjects indicates our model successfully produce high-reality colored images, yielding more than 62.6% positive feedback while the rate of ground truth images is 70.0%. Furthermore, a significance t-test between the percentages of humans rating as real image for each test case shows the p-value is 0.1359 > 0.05, which indicates our generated results have no significant difference with the ground truth images.\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 67\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\n17"

      "text" : "The problem of colorization was proposed from last century, but the research of diverse colorization was not paid much attention until this decade. [Cheng et al., 2015] used additionally trained model to handle diverse colorization of a scene image particularly in day and dawn. [Zhang et al., 2016] posed the diverse colorization problem as a classification task and use class-rebalancing at training time to increase the diversity of colors in the result. [Deshpande et al., 2016] learned a low dimensional embedding of color fields using a variational auto-encoder (VAE). They constructed loss terms for the VAE decoder that avoid blurry outputs and take into account the uneven distribution of pixel colors and finally developed a conditional model for the multi-modal distribution between gray-level image and the color field embeddings.\nCompared with above work, our solution uses conditional generative adversarial networks to achieve unsupervised diverse colorization in a generic way with little domain knowledge of the images."

      "text" : "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) [Goodfellow et al., 2014] have attained much attention in unsupervised learning research during the recent 3 years. Conditional GANs have been widely used in various computer vision scenarios. [Reed et al., 2016] used text to generate image by applying adversarial networks. [Isola et al., 2016] provided a general-purpose image-to-image translation model that handles tasks like label to scene, aerial to map, day to night, edges to photo and also grayscale to color.\nSome of above work may share a similar goal with us, but our conditional GAN structure differs a lot from previous work in several architectural choices mainly for the generator. Unlike other generators which employ an encoder-like front part consisting of multiple convolution layers and a decoderlike end part consisting of multiple deconvolution layers, our generator uses only convolution layers all over the architecture, and does not downsize data shape by applying convolution stride no more than 1 and no pooling operation. Additionally, we add multi-layer noise to generate more diverse colorization, while using multi-layer conditional information to keep the generated image highly realistic."

      "text" : "GANs are generative models that learn a mapping from random noise vector z to output color image x: G : z → x. Compared with GANs, conditional GANs learn a mapping from observed grayscale image y and random noise vector z, to x: G : {y, z} → x. The generator G is trained to produce outputs that cannot be distinguished from “real” images by an adversarially trained discriminator D, which is trained with the aim at detecting the “fake” images produced by the generator. This training procedure is shown in Figure 1.\nThe objective of a GAN can be expressed as\nLGAN(G,D) =Ex∼Pdata(x)[logD(x)]+ Ez∼Pz(z)[log (1−D(G(z)))],\n(1)\nwhile the objective of a conditional GAN is\nLcGAN(G,D) =Ex∼Pdata(x)[logD(x)]+ (2) Ey∼Pgray(y),z∼Pz(z)[log (1−D(G(y, z)))],\nwhere G tries to minimize this objective against an adversarial D that tries to maximize it. i.e.\nG∗ = argmin G max D LcGAN(G,D) (3)\nWithout z, the generator could still learn a mapping from y to x, but would produce deterministic outputs. That is why GAN is more suitable for diverse colorization tasks than other deterministic neural networks."

      "heading" : "Convolution or deconvolution",
      "text" : "Convolution and deconvolution layers are two basic components of image generators. Convolution layers are used mainly to exact conditional features. And additionally, many researches [Zhang et al., 2016; Isola et al., 2016; Deshpande et al., 2016] use superposition of multiple convolution layers with stride more than 1 to downsize the data shape, which works as a data encoder. Deconvolution layers are then used to upsize the data shape as a decoder of the data representation [Nguyen et al., 2016a; Isola et al., 2016; Deshpande et al., 2016]. While many other researches share this encoder-decoder structure, we choose to use only convolution layers in our generator G. Firstly, convolution layers is well capable of feature extraction and transmission.\nMeanwhile, all the convolution stride is set to 1 to prevent data shape from downsizing, thus the important spatial information can be kept along the data flow till the final generation layer. Other work [Ronneberger et al., 2015; Isola et al., 2016] also takes this spatial information into consideration. They added skip connections between each layer i and layer n− i to form a “U-Net” structure, where n is the total number of layers. Each skip connection simply concatenates all channels at layer i with those at layer n− i. But our modification is more straightforward and easy to implement."

      "heading" : "YUV or RGB",
      "text" : "A color image can be represented in different forms. The most common representation is RGB form which splits a color pixel into red, green, blue three channels. Most computer vision tasks use RGB representation like [Deshpande et al., 2015; Isola et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016b] due to its generality. Other kinds of representations are also included like Lab [Charpiat et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2016; Limmer and Lensch, 2016], Y UV (or Y CrCb) [Cheng et al., 2015]. In colorization tasks, we have grayscale image as conditional information, so there is convenience using Y UV representation, because the Y channel or so called Luminance channel represents exactly the grayscale information. So while using Y UV representation, we can just predict 2 channels and then concatenate with the grayscale channel to give a full color image. Additionally, if you use RGB as image representation, all result channels are predicted, thus to keep the grayscale of generated color image consistent with the original grayscale image, we need to add an additional loss Eq. (4) as a controller to make sure Gray(x) ' y: LL1(G) = Ey∼Pgray(y),z∼Pz(z)[‖y −Gray(G(y, z))‖], (4) where function Y = Gray(RGB) is the well-known psychological formulation:\nY = 0.299R+ 0.587G+ 0.114B. (5) Note that Eq. (4) can still remain colorization diversity. Then the objective function will be modified to:\nG∗ = argmin G max D LcGAN(G,D) + λLL1(G) (6)\nBut no matter how we change the λ parameter to balance two loss parts, the L1 part will not reach zero, so there will always be blurry unless the model is overfitting. We do comparison experiments on both RGB and Y UV representations, results are shown in Section 4.2."

To handle this problem, they provide noise only in the form of dropout, applied on several layers of the generator at both training and testing time. We also noticed this problem. Traditional GANs and condition GANs receive noise information at the very start layer, during the continuous data transformation through the network, the noise information attenuated a lot. To overcome this problem and make the colorization results more diversified, we concatenate the noise channel onto the first half of the generator layers (the first three layers in our case). We do comparison experiments on both one-layer noise and multilayer noise representations, with results shown in Section 4.2.\nAlgorithm 1 Training phase of our conditional GANs, with the default parameters kD = 1, kG = 1,m = 64, sz = 100, s = 64.\n1: for the number of training iterations do 2: for kD steps do 3: Generate minibatch of m randomly sampled noise {z(1), . . . , z(m)} each of size [sz]. 4: Sample minibatch of m grayscale images {y(1), . . . ,y(m)} each of shape [s, s, 1]. 5: Get the corresponding minibatch of m color images {x(1), . . . ,x(m)} from data distribution pdata(x). 6: Update the discriminator D by:\n∇θd 1\nm m∑ i=1 [logD(x(i)) + log (1−D(G(y(i),z(i))))]\n7: end for 8: for kG steps do 9: Generate minibatch of m randomly sampled noise\n{z(1), . . . , z(m)} 10: Sample minibatch of m grayscale images {y(1), . . . ,y(m)} 11: Update the generator by:\n∇θg 1\nm m∑ i=1 log(1−D(G(y(i),z(i))))\n12: end for 13: end for"

Though the “UNet” skip structure of [Isola et al., 2016] can also help posterior layers receive conditional information, our model modification is still more straightforward and convenient.

However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.",
