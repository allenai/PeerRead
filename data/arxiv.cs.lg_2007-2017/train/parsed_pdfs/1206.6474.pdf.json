      "text" : "Matrix estimation is at the center of many modern applications and theoretical advances in the field of high dimensional statistics. The key element which differentiates this problem from standard high dimensional vector estimation lies in the structural assumptions which are formulated in this context. Indeed, the notion of sparsity assumption has been transposed into the concept of low-rank matrices and opened the way to numerous achievements (see for instance (Srebro, 2004; Cai et al., 2008)). In this paper, we argue that being low-rank is not only an equivalent of sparsity for matrices but that being low-rank and sparse\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\ncan actually be seen as two orthogonal concepts. The underlying structure we have in mind is that of a block diagonal matrix. This situation occurs for instance in covariance matrix estimation in the case of groups of highly correlated variables or when denoising/clustering social graphs.\nEfficient procedures developed in the context of sparse model estimation mostly rely on the use of `1-norm regularization (Tibshirani, 1996). Natural extensions include cases where subsets of related variables are known to be active simultaneously (Yuan & Lin, 2006). These methods are readily adapted to matrix valued data and have been applied to covariance estimation (El Karoui, 2009; Bien & Tibshirani, 2010) and graphical model structure learning (Banerjee et al., 2007; Friedman et al., 2008). In the low-rank matrix completion problem, the standard relaxation approach leads to the use of the trace norm as the main regularizer within the optimization procedures (Srebro et al., 2005; Koltchinskii et al., 2011) and their resolution can either be obtained in closed form (loss measured in terms of Frobenius norm) or through iterative proximal solutions (Combettes & Pesquet, 2011; Beck & Teboulle, 2009) (for general classes of losses). However, solutions of low-rank estimation problems are in general not sparse at all, while denoising and variable selection on matrix-valued data are blind to the global structure of the matrix and process each variable independently.\nIn this paper, we study the benefits of using the sum of `1 and trace-norms as regularizer. This sum of penalties on the same object allows to benefit from the virtues of both of them, in the same way as the elastic-net (Zou & Hastie, 2005) combines the sparsityinducing property of the `1 norm with the smoothness of the quadratic regularizer. Trace norm and `1 penalties have already been combined in a different context.\nIn Robust PCA (Candes et al., 2009) and related literature, the signal S is assumed to have an additive decomposition S = X + Y where X is sparse and Y low-rank. Note that S is not in general sparse nor lowrank and that this decomposition is subject to identifiability issues, as analyzed, e.g., in (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011). The decomposition is recovered by using `1-norm regularization over X and trace norm regularization over Y . This technique has been successfully applied to background substraction in image sequences, to graph clustering (Jalali et al., 2011) and covariance estimation (Luo, 2011).\nHere, we consider the different situation where the matrix S is sparse and low-rank at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our mixed penalty on different problems. We develop proximal methods to solve these convex optimization problems and we provide numerical evidence as well as theoretical arguments which illustrate the trade-off which can be achieved with the suggested method.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the setup and motivations. Sections 3 and 4 are devoted to theoretical results on the interplay between sparse and low-rank effects. Section 5 presents algorithms used for resolution of the optimization problem and Section 6 is devoted to numerical experiments. The last Section explores related topics."

The matrix (M)+ is the componentwise positive part of the matrix M, and sgn(M) is the sign matrix associated to M with the convention sgn(0) = 0. The component wise product of matrices is denoted by ◦. The class S+n of matrices is the convex cone of positive semidefinite matrices in Rn×n. The sparsity index of M is ||M ||0 =\n|{Mi,j 6= 0}| and the Frobenius norm of a matrix M is defined by ‖M‖2F = ∑ i,jM 2 i,j .

In the case of the sole rank constraint, (Srebro, 2004) remarked that all low-rank matrices with the same sign pattern are equivalent in terms of loss and applied a standard argument for generalization in classes of finite cardinality. In the work of Srebro, a beautiful argument is used to upper bound the number of distinct sign configurations for predictors of rank r\nslr(n, r) = |{sgn(S) |S ∈ Rn×n, rank(S) ≤ r}|\nleading to the following generalization performance: for δ > 0, A ∈ {0, 1}n×n and with probability 1−δ over choosing a subset E of entries in {1, . . . , n}2 uniformly\namong all subsets of |E| entries, we have for any matrix S of rank at most r and ∆(n, r) = ( 8en r )2nr `(S,A) < `E(S,A) + √ log ∆(n, r)− log δ\n2|E| .

By upper bounding the number of sign configurations for a fixed sparsity pattern in (U, V ) using an argument similar to (Srebro, 2004), a union bound gives\nssplr(n, r, s) ≤ Γ(n, r, s) = ( 16en2\ns\n)s( 2nr\ns\n) .\nUsing the same notations as previously, we deduce from this result the following generalization bound: with probability 1− δ and for all S ∈M(n, r, s),\n`(S,A) < `E(S,A) +\n√ log Γ(n, r, s)− log δ\n2|E| . (2)\nIn general, bound (2) is tighter than (1) for sufficiently large values of n as shown in the next proposition. The two bounds coincide when s = 2nr, that is, when (U, V ) is dense and there is no sparsity constraint.\nProposition 2.

On the other hand, Douglas-Rachford splitting tackles the case of q ≥ 2 terms but does not benefits from differentiability. A generalization of these two setups has been recently proposed in (Raguet\net al., 2011) under the name of Generalized ForwardBackward, which we specialize to our problem in Algorithm 1. The proximal operators are applied in parallel, and the resulting (Z1, Z2, Z3) is projected onto the constraint that Z1 = Z2 = Z3 which is given by the mean.

In addition to this, it is often suggested that interactions between two proteins are governed by a small set of factors, such as surface accessible amino acid side chains (Bock & Gough, 2001), which motivates the estimation of a low-rank representation. Representing the data as a weighted graph, we filter to retain only the 10% of all 4394 proteins that exhibit the most interactions as measured by weighted degree. We corrupt 10% of entries of the adjacency matrix selected uniformly at random by uniform noise in [0, η]. Parameters are selected by cross-validation and algorithms are evaluated using mean RMSE between estimated and original adjacency matrices over 25 runs. RMSE scores are shown in Table 1 and show the empirical superiority of our approach (SPLR).\nSocial Networks. We have performed experiments with the Facebook100 data set analyzed by (Traud et al., 2011). The data set comprises all friendship relations between students affiliated to a specific university, for a selection of one hundred universities. We select a\nsingle university with 41554 users and filter as in the previous case to keep only the 10% users with highest degrees. In this case, entries are corrupted by impulse noise: a fixed fraction σ of randomly chosen edges are flipped, thus introducing noisy friendship relations and masking some existing relations. The task is to discover the noisy relations and recover masked relations. We compare our method to standard baselines in link prediction (Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg, 2007). Nearest Neighbors (NN) relies on the number of common friends between each pair of users, which is given by A2 when A is the noisy graph adjacency matrix. Katz’s coefficient connects a pair of nodes according to a score based on the number of paths connecting them, emphasizing short paths. Results are reported in Table 2 using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). SPLR outperforms LR but also NN and Katz which do not directly seek a low-rank representation."

      "heading" : "7. Discussion",
      "text" : "Other loss functions. The methods presented in this paper can be seamlessly extended to non-square matrices, which can arise, for instance, from adjacency matrices of bipartite graphs. Our work also applies to a wide range of other losses. A useful example that links our work to the matrix completion framework is when linear measurements of the target matrix or graph are available, or can be predicted as in (Richard et al., 2010). In this case, the loss can be defined in the feature space. Due to the low-rank assumption, our method does not directly apply to the estimation of precision matrices often used for gaussian graphical model structure learning (Friedman et al., 2008), and the applications of conditional independence structures generated by low-rank and possibly sparse models is to be discussed. Note that the trace norm constraint is vacuous for some special classes of positive semi-definite matrices. For instance, it is not useful for estimating a correlation matrix as, in this case, the trace is always equal to the dimension.\nMatrix factorizations. A related and popular task is finding low-rank factorizations of matrices of the form\nUV T (see, e.g., (Srebro et al., 2005; Srebro, 2004)), thus jointly optimizing in U, V ∈ Rn×r loss functions of the form `((U, V ), A) = ||UV T −A||2F for some target maximum rank r. This implicitly encodes the lowrank constraint which leads to efficient optimization schemes, and allows for interpretability as estimated (U, V ) pairs can be considered as latent factors. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee et al., 1999) imposes non negativity constraints on the coefficients of U and V to enhance interpretability by allowing only for additive effects and tends to produce sparse factor matrices U, V , although this a rather indirect effect. There is no strong guarantee on the sparsity achieved by NMF nor is it easy to set the target sparsity and different methods for sparse NMF have been proposed in (Hoyer, 2004; Kim & Park, 2008). Sparse matrix factorizations have also been proposed without the positivity constraint. Most work along this line is motivated by extending the classical PCA and finding sparse directions that maximize the variance of the projection. Most methods give up orthogonality between the components and can thus be seen as sparse matrix factorization techniques. SPCA proposed in (Zou et al., 2004) penalizes the `1 norm of the principal components and can be reduced to solving independent elastic-nets. A different formulation using SDP programming is introduced in (D’Aspremont et al., 2007) with good empirical results. In spite of good empirical performances, all these methods based on matrix factorization suffer from a significant drawback. Although formulations are usually convex in U or V, they are not in general jointly convex and optimization procedures can get stuck in local minima.\nRegularization parameters. We showed how to empirically select using cross-validation the hyper parameters τ and γ for a specific application. From a theoretical point of view, Proposition 1 provides us with performance guarantees when the regularization parameters are large enough. We know from random matrix theory that the operator norm of a random gaussian matrix concentrates around √ n which enforces a stringent constraint on τ for τ ≥ 2α|| ||op to hold with high probability. Similarly, the ∞-norm ‖ ‖∞ can be bounded by ‖ ‖op or using the multivariate Tchebycheff inequality of (Olkin & Pratt, 1958) which implies that the condition γ ≥ 2(1 − α)‖ ‖∞ is satisfied with probability 1 − δ when γ = Ω ( (1− α) 2nσδ ) . In practice, γ should not exceed the order of magnitude of the entries of the matrix, as this leads to a trivial zero solution. Asymptotically, to keep the sparsity regularization parameter γ of the order of magnitude of elements of the observation matrix A, the free parameter α must be chosen so that 1−αn ∼n 1n . This gives\nthe same asymptotic behavior in O( √ n) for the lower bound on τ as in matrix completion.\nOptimization. Other optimization techniques can be considered for future work. A trace norm constraint alone can be taken into account without projection or relaxation into a penalized form by casting the problem as a SDP as proposed in (Jaggi, 2011). The special form of this SDP can be leveraged to use the efficient resolution technique from (Hazan, 2008). This method applies to a differentiable objective whose curvature determines the performances. Extending these methods with projection onto the `1 ball or a sparsityinducing penalty could lead to interesting developments."
