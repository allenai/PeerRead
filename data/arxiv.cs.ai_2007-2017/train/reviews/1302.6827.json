It is formalized in the ATMS framework (each source corresponds to an assumption). We assume then that all sources are independent and \"fail\" with a very small probability. This leads to a probability assignment on the set of candidates, or equivalently on the set of consistent environments. This probability assignment induces a Dempster-Shafer belief function which measures the probability that a proposition can be deduced from the evidence. This belief function can be used in several different ways to define a non-monotonic consequence relation. We study and compare these consequence relations. The -case of prioritized knowledge bases is briefly considered.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:00 GMT  (1261kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6827v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jerome lang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6827"}
