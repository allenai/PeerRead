In a nutshell, the aim of instantiation-based argumentation is to form, from a given knowledge base, a set of arguments and to identify the conflicts between them. The resulting network is then evaluated by means of extension-based semantics on an abstract level, i.e. on the resulting graph. While several systems are nowadays available for the latter step, the automation of the instantiation process itself has received less attention. In this work, we provide a novel approach to construct and visualize an argumentation framework from a given knowledge base. The system we propose relies on Answer-Set Programming and follows a two-step approach. A first program yields the logic-based arguments as its answer-sets; a second program is then used to specify the relations between arguments based on the answer-sets of the first program. As it turns out, this approach not only allows for a flexible and extensible tool for instantiation-based argumentation, but also provides a new method for answer-set visualization in general.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:11 GMT  (115kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1388v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["g\\\"unther charwat", "johannes peter wallner", "stefan woltran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1388"}
