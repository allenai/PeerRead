      "text" : "~ 1 ~\nsupport system (IDSS), which handles an efficient and effective way to rapidly inspect containerized cargos for defection. Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc. The system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection. This new technique saves time and money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of running n inspections on n containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation or a ratio of 3:n is required, assuming n > 3 containers. The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actuallydamaged cargo by calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population. The estimated values on damaged, somewhat damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision. The report describes the problem domain and the implementation of the simulator prototype, showing how the system operates via software, hardware with/without human agents, conducting real-time inspections and management per se."

      "text" : "Real-time resource sorting and management with the right results on cargos, is always a challenge in critical decision makings defined within the domain of\ntransportation industry. The time of cargo defection/damage detection (CDD), displaying cargo condition or its state during transport, effectively and efficiently, are hereby simulated real-time using non-human and human IDSS agents.\nThis project inducts a feasible technique, designed and developed from scratch, on an array of indexed cargos being shipped (or freighted) from a particular location,1 zone or country as point A, thereby inspections conducted before (waiting to be loaded), during (various hazards of journey) and after transport to destination, as point B.\nTriangulation techniques can generate real-time results on classified or indexed data representing an array of objects located in one location for a specific condition, as detected within a time limit before objects relocation. That “condition” could indicate a damaged, hazardous or any type affecting other objects and even humans negatively, if detection is not done early enough. A sorting algorithm using this “triangulation” is closely coupled with real-time agents detecting the specific condition as the mother algorithm. This algorithm is comprised of human agents, non-human agents and sensory units (within\n1 Each container is labeled in the list “{x1, x2, x3, …, xn}” where x denotes an alphabetical letter as the cargo column geographically occupied either in a stack form or single containers, and n the number of the chosen container ready for inspection.\nar X\niv :1\n27 12\n82 v1\n[c s.A\nI] 4\nJu n\n2 | P a g e\nthe agent’s domain of activities) to run detection once triangulation gives them a particular index (specific object) to inspect.\nWe developed the triangulation solution on cargos via agents active in a simulation program which further attains a reliable IDSS outcome for its manager(s). The relationships of the available options coming from the IDSS system core is indicated with an ‘ * ’ symbol, denoting that many decisions are being made throughout the conduction process of the SAT inspections via human agents. In particular, after devices detect the problem, yet the final decision depends on the inspector and the cargo manager, asking themselves what to do with the damaged version of the cargo."

      "text" : "The CDD-SAT IDSS project is a new system proposed to sort cargos from a population of damaged and undamaged stacks in the shortest time possible with reliable estimates [12]. These estimates are supposed to be representing the whole stack population during collaborative inspections conducted by agents for certain conditions exhibited by the containers from the cargo environment. The rules to set up this system, its objectives and the knowhow of conducting the analysis, were initially introduced in our project proposal. In this report, however, we further elaborate and demonstrate the intelligence aspects of our system based on the CDD-SAT simulation results, and realworld scenarios’ dataset. The system further aims to produce such estimates to prevent further cargo damages happening in short slices of time. The system also attempts to ease any managerial decision being made on hazardous cargos to ethically save people from life-threatening situations."

We adapt 3D parameters during information gather from the surfaces to 2D parameter where the stack is located from topview during each SAT phase. This makes the sorting of the cargo array in a 2D frame much easier whilst retaining the actual 3D values intrinsically. This data is visible in terms of red, orange and green as probabilistic P values in the Database (DB) file. Hence, the DB component plays an important role for this dimensional values’ adaptation, since we are using a uniform language of probabilistic values ranging from 0 to 1. Such P values are highlighted in the SAT system criteria in § 3.5."

      "text" : "comply with the following computational objectives:\n1. The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actual damaged cargo by software, calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population. 2. Relatively, a three-dimensional surface and contour mapping from containers are constructed once data acquired at the scene. The averaged values are stored in a DB file for further processing. Parametric adaptations between xy and xyz data take place after DB access, to submit a concrete P value during value updates, giving an\nestimated verdict on cargo status for the whole population.\nTo satisfy these objectives, we have intricately formulated the following equations in our program code to implement the SAT algorithm’s logic components.\n√ (1)\n( ) (2)\n( ) (3)\nwhere C is for cargo stack population n under triangulation defined by square root operator with a growing limit added by 1. After finishing operations on Eq. (1), S is then initiated for the suggested containers, as given by Problem Definition # 4. From there, D is run to detect damages from the real environment on cargos generating rog or red, orange, and green results. Eq. (1) is reiterated and combined with Eq. (2) to estimate array distances between the nearby rog’s as a newly estimated list of stacks located in x and y dimensions (a j index), or\n( ) (√ )\n( )\nThe deduced ratio in Eq. (4), delivers at which xy point, there would be a probable r or o or g adjacent to the actual detected ones by sensor (at least 3 containers are reported from Eq. 3). Thus, the reiteration for updating cargo results with more detections, makes the production of the xybased ratios more accurate on the next trials (or phases) of SAT closing in the triangle by a factor of xy/2 on the grid (see Fig. 3, where the triangle shrinks by phase). This is a SAT system evolution as the probability over time is predicted per repeated cargo damage. This as a solution is later outlined in §3.4. Hence, with proper procedural and method callings within the code, we invoked the components of these equations to process I/O data relative to the\n4 | P a g e\nfunction’s side of the equation (left-hand side of the equation)"

      "heading" : "3.5 SYSTEM CRITERIA",
      "text" : "The system displays a list of sorted cargos, color-coded and labeled for the cargo inspectors and mangers of the system. The colors on the sorted list of labels are reported and stored as orange (a grey state, e.g. a probability of P = 0.2 to 0.5) indicating somewhat damaged cargos, green indicating undamaged cargos (P < 0.2) and red for significantly damaged cargos (P > 0.5). The inspection is conducted in three triangulation phases, each referring to the sorted list either current or previously-recorded in the database to update the list as each phase successively progresses to its next, for the SAT service. The probability P score ranging from 0 to 1 is calculated from the results gained from the various tests performed. Here is a list of all of the important criteria defining our P, relative to constraints (Fig. 1):\n Maintenance - The detectors recheck bounds, and hardware status is regularly checked which is part of the monitoring process on devices such as listing any symptoms on component failures, errors in detection, etc. prior to cargo inspection.\n Intelligence - The intelligence is tested in a test covering several various areas: – Logic: mainly, “how the system is\nmanaged and processed?” – Patterns: imagery analysis based on\nplotting container surface points and measuring their distances from each other, where the program produces filtered images to identify damaged\n5 | P a g e\nsurfaces from undamaged ones (see image binarization from the following paragraphs). This complies with Hyosung Lee, et al. [9] actual methods of computing actual damages based on surfaces and depth analysis. – Shapes: Design and Graphics relative to mathematical and geometric calculation in suggesting containers as well as identifying their status. – Mathematics: formulaic solutions conveying to the triangulation, and calculating graph distances between damaged and contiguously-detected damaged vs. undamaged cargos. The aim is to generate probabilistic pi results, based on “patterns” and “shapes” from above (quite analytic and mathematical), thus their averaged sum with other p’s, build up the final P for our Q&Q analysis. – Physics: detectors and sensory agents for inspection purposes employed within the cargo environment – Data management: a DB raw file contains records on the sorted greens, reds and orange items – Knowledgebase subsystem, based on previous SAT experience on specific data records: records on the sorted greens, reds and orange list, if the same list appear for a similar container population configuration, the results shall remain similar despite of environmental complications\n Wireless vs. cable-based technology - Rather than totally relying on human input, the inspection system must relay information from the cargo environment via detectors to the system, thereby processed by software for analysis and results. This is aided by using a simple wireless local area network (LAN) connection, and in worst case scenarios where atmospheric changes become dramatic, other remedies such as direct cables as well as human input (console based) are contemplated.\n Mechanical - The Crane Docking facility and detectors’ dynamic properties involve mechanics which could affect the rate of inspections depending in what state the cargo is i.e. being unloaded, loaded or just stacked-up in some location. An optional requirement is testing mechanical skills for evaluating the time efficiency of the system.\n Cognition - Self and environmental awareness of the human inspector is crucial in reading the LCD unit on the detectors when they display results during detection. The validity and correctness of the results prior to the automated system relaying information to system core for processing must be monitored based on this skill. • Physical color sight and detection - The color sight is tested by trying to identify cargos on colored backgrounds for a damaged section, pictured as follows: the red indicates a damaged area (in case of radiation, the physical area or material where radiation is exposed)\nData Acquisition and SAT processing conform to the following two paragraphs:\n Fast surface-point inspection - Simple cameras and laser-based detectors: Material surface analysis is wellexplicated in the paper written by Hyosung Lee, et al. [9] distinguishing the damaged surface from a healthy one during camera recordings, observation and imagery analysis. The measurement satisfies the physical bounds on:\n1- Surface Roughness , 2- Depth\nWhereas, we have also prioritized an image binarization solution to focus on suspicious spots detected on the surface (a typical image capturing technique). This is to shortcut the surface damage estimates, as illustrated later in Fig. 8, thereby conducting the 3D beam scattering technique akin to Hyosung Lee et al. technique.\n6 | P a g e\n In-depth surface point inspection - SAT detection via sensors (CCD detectors) are thorough for an inspected unit (container) hence not a random estimate of damages, in fact an accurate and efficient way to inspect a set of containers co-local to others on the vessel, or after shipping, on the platform. After image “binarization” (above paragraph) a geological analysis tool called Surfer 9 [10] aided us in simulating 3D and contour mapping of the captured image of the surface i.e. incoming data from the scene acquired by the detectors where cargo is located.\n Administrator and maintenance - System administrator must make sure all reported data, profiled information based on the DB component as well as accuracy of the devices being used by inspectors, are in position. The accuracy and correctness of data converted to interpretable data as information to the users (inspectors and managers) must be maintained by maintainers of the system on a physical level: this means that before, during, after inspections, all\nsensory subsystems and detectors for inspection purposes and data accuracy are checked and rechecked on a regular basis indeed.\n Cargo status - Based on a sensory inspection (a detector) within the triangle’s geometric range, 2 suggesting specific containers to the inspector to inspect. The detector generates results on that container displayed to the inspector as either damaged, somewhat damaged or undamaged on his/her handheld portable detector. Note that, for an automated system, an installed rail permitting the detector to slide in-and-out, accelerates this inspection process. If a crane system is operated by an inspector, after e.g. the ship docks, the stacks of cargos are scanned via relevant detectors for defection detection.\n Cargo records and classification - The inspector relays data via the detector to the software for SAT estimates, once the three inspections are carried out covering the 3 sides of the triangle. The inspector’s cargo is recorded after weighing the physical conditions of the cargo, estimates a list of cargos matching the description of the detected, and thus listing three containers on the record (database)1 to produce more results. Now, the agents proceed to the next phase of the triangulation for more accurate estimates or list.\n SAT service needs - Informs the decision process of the inspection needs for a certain real-time occupation at cargo locations, e.g. “3 more detectors needed to inspect these cargos”\n Agent's Interface - A command-line interface (CLI) is a mechanism for interacting with a computer operating system or software by typing commands to perform specific tasks. Pending or in-\n2The “range searching problems” and data structures are a fundamental topic of computational geometry. The range searching problem finds applications not only in areas that deal with processing geometrical data (like geographical information systems (GIS), and CAD), but also in databases. See also [11].\n7 | P a g e\nqueue detection tasks relayed from one detector (hardware interface) to the software DB belongs to this mechanism.\n Human vision relative to cognition - Based on human visual and cognitive limitations relative to the inspection environment between two containers (bearing a certain measurable distance), one must consider this inspector to fully function according to the protocols and assignments given for a cargo inspection. If issues like dyslexia, color blindness or any human deficiencies involved (instantaneously, otherwise, a long-term side-effect ignored due to being a known employed worker to the company) could\nencounter wrong deductions on the reading of data as well as the quality and integrity of information process.\n A trainable/learnable SAT algorithm - The data is updated on regular 3-time inspections made over a population of cargos. Of course, the inspections are 3/n for each triangulation relative to a redorange-green estimate result."

The VB, C++ API interfaces with both specialization and generalization relationships (reciprocal and hierarchical) to other UML elements of the CDD-SAT system are highlighted in the diagram. Moreover, the Java Applet class plays the final role in displaying all the collated, processed and disseminated data from the previous CDD-SAT phases of the simulation in form of tables plus a time savings graph on screen (later inducted as Eq. 5). The processors system and subsystem deal with Input/output signals, from the moment where cargo surface data are acquired from the system, until the moment where processes reach conclusions and verdicts portraying the cargo status in the DB component. Of course, the ‘repository system’ acts as a middleware to other systems, preserving a specific format during I/O data transmissions. The format is based on the storage package which precludes any noiseform structure or sequence of raw 0 and 1 data. In fact, the formatted repository preserves the piped and packeted digital forms of data as other systems’ meaningful output into the database. Therefore, the information enabling the user as a central link to communicate between all SDD and SAT systems during communication is done via signals, obeying the DB assigned protocol within the processors subsystem.\n13 | P a g e\nThe assigned protocol is a customized agreement of how data should be stored, and thereby programmers have a certain standard to make their program communicate with other programs during\noperations. The current version of the protocol where all subsystems communicate successfully from one CDD-SAT phase after another is shown in Fig. 7 of our DB section.\n14 | P a g e\nThe ‘CDD-SAT display system’ is the resultant of the summing junction (association) of both SAT and SDD systems according to Fig. 5, (recognizable by the symbol). Meaning that, the two SDD and SAT systems communicate with each other, after and during, the occurrence of SAT and SDD phases of the algorithm. The results and operations are displayed on screen mostly via GUI, and in the background, the CLI interface. The CLI receives input right at the beginning from the user indicating the cargo stack population ranging from 3 to n stacks. So, a stacks’ input < 3, is not acceptable to the systems, reasoning that there is at least 3 containers or stacks to be inspected by detectors, concurrently (per phase).\nThe 1 or 2 containers input, given by the user in this exception, will not be processed in terms of SAT, since SAT is a sorting array system dealing with an n cargo population. However, if the system only runs on the basis of SDD, which analyzes a surface ranging from 1 to a set of containers (n), this would be acceptable.\nIn case of inspection of one container only, and not the population of stacks, the users disable the SAT option from the software, and solely do their analysis by the SDD part of the IDSS system. Therefore, in this case, no errors are reported.\nThe hybrid simulator, according to Fig. 5, clearly demonstrates how all interfaces via GUI and CLI components are in real-time and concurrent communication. Indeed, there is a “model” class sitting right at the bottom with a strong composition to the incoming and outgoing signals occurring between interface controls (program timers), scenario closure points, and their calculations on the stack population, time, surface damage pixels, and angular, etc.-limits of the program, defining the parameters of the CDD-SAT system.\nAll detailed descriptions for each UML element are provided in our documentation located in a “/doc” folder, fulfilling each coded solution on the system, and submitted as a supplementary document to the prototype,\non its technical account. 3 Nonetheless, the brief description of our hybrid simulator elements such as classes, components, and their roles in Fig. 5, is given by Table 3.\nThe conversion of data types is exemplified in our classes, e.g., OutputMap from a VB class for each integer data type displayed, analyzed (compared with other points) and stored as an xy point of an xy topological map, otherwise an xyz reference point to an xyz topological map, is either exported in integer, to form a grid map, otherwise, a string to store a verdict {red, orange, green} in the database file based on “SurfaceDensityMapsModule” processes and analysis. The “module” calls specific map tool instances from packages, in this case, Surfer 9 to satisfy xy, and xyz map object analysis. The decomposition of Surfer 9 [10] and other applications, their interfaces (API), class instances, components, packages communicating via signals occurring between interfaces, has been shown in Fig. 5. The Surfer program is treated as a reference tool, and using a scripting language like VBScript, importing and exporting certain values on maps by the “module” becomes feasible.\nFinally, the results are to be presented online (wireless technology from § 3.5) to the inspector and cargo manager, hence the Java Applet browsing solution for displaying DB results and time savings (performance), becomes quite relevant to the current CDDSAT architecture.\nFor each VB and C++ API or Java Applet interface, we have signified the very notation of how to exist in programming terms when you demonstrate your skills between highlevel OOP and low-level machine language? Of course, the answer is obvious.\nThe conversion of any data type is conditional to the way the code is compiled prior to implementation indeed. There is a difference in how we interpret/compile the words, expressions, etc. in binary to fulfill our class relationships.\n3 Ask authors for the full supplementary documentation of the codes on the prototype.\n15 | P a g e"

This allowed all members to play along the IDSS requirements fulfilling the objectives of the project as well as I/O data quality (avoiding any garbage-in garbage-out, GIGO, encountering) hence, maintaining good performance on the simulation part of the project. A well-defined strategy was taken into action between our developed samples and certain portions of the prototype. For instance, the main GUI programmed in C++ for the user satisfying the graphics of the application, was partly as a sub-GUI programmed in classic VB and VB.NET for the inspector running the detectors. The good thing about .NET framework is that “it includes a large library and supports several programming languages, which allows language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages)” [5].\nThe simulation background however, was initially programmed in C++ or C-compatible Win32.exe console based (the CLI class, Fig. 1 or 5), which processed the main mathematics anchored behind the SAT model on cargos (see § 5.1.1 pseudocode). All data acquisitions\nand post-processes were, of course, recorded in one raw DB file representing two corresponding DB files as exemplified in the following tables. All data were recorded according to an agreed custom format between team members. These data built our central information and at each team member’s disposal during I/O data access, read and write operations. We assigned one standard protocol or a format to our database files (Tables 4 and 5) in our implementation. This enabled all of us to refer to the database and send relevant signals to each other through creating new temporary files in aim of proceeding from one SAT phase to another. Thus, we practically created a hybrid simulation comprised of executable subprograms triggering one another for each contributing scenario. The chronology of events was never disrupted based on this hybrid development as far as we disciplined ourselves to stick to the agreed DB standard, corresponding files during data transactions accessible by our codes.\nTable 4 below, represents the I/O data before sorting, during, and after sorting (cargo list and cardinality results) for an example of 48 stacked-up containers (just like the diagram). The minimal input is the cargo population, in this case, 48 containers highlighted in black.\nTable 5 below, mainly represents lists of sorted and ‘to-be-sorted’ containers corresponding to the relative attributes (columns) of Table 4, from phase 1 to phase 3, whereas phase 3 submits the final estimated results to the manager at phase 4.\nTotal C o n\ntain er\nP o p u latio n\nSo rtin g P o p u\nlatio n fo r\nA lp h a\nSo rtin g P o p u\nlatio n fo r\nB eta\nSo rtin g P o p u\nlatio n fo r\nG am m a\nD etected A lp h a\nD etected B eta\nD etected G am m a\nList o f R ed\nList o f O ran ge\nList o f G reen\nSo rted\nP o p u latio n\nIn sp ectio n s\nPhase 1 48 4 12 12 C12 D1 A7 A7, D1 0 C12 28 3\nPhase 2 30 3 10 10 B11, D11 D5, D11 B4 B4, D5 D11 B11 23 3\nPhase 3 6 2 3 3 D10 D8, D10 C8 0 C8, D8, D10\n0 8 3\nTotal 59 9\n19 | P a g e"

      "text" : "The intelligent aspects of our prototype are the functionality of providing suggestions based on the available input. This is an activity usually performed by a skilled human and a set of sensory devices (detectors) identified as agents in our design. However, the system takes into account valid inputs by using our prototype with a certain knowledge level built upon agents’ input as well as computations on the same input. The system in turn (which inspection phase?) delivers an output as a suggestion to inspect specific cargo labels in the cargo environment. The inspector no longer has to keep track of all inspection results and does not have to conduct inspection on all cargos.\nThe system handles the relay points between detectors, and optimally runs 3 detections concurrently by the α, β and γ detectors. The inspector and the CDDSAT system core where a decision is suggested are in position during the steps (recall Use-Case 4.3.3).\nAn intelligent decision is suggested to inspect a particular container during triangulations to human agents, firstly, as inspectors, using their portable sensors (detectors), and for quicker results using automated screens moving between\ncontainers; secondly, submitting profiles to the manager(s) of the system as a resultant report on cargo inspections and finally, for a higher managerial decision i.e. what to do with the damaged version of the cargo? We have not covered the last one since it involves decision making solutions on a longer timescale during transportation i.e. a tactical model which is out of the current prototype’s scope and suitable as an updated version producing sophisticated list of options relative to company protocols. These protocols, depending on what type of e.g. shipping company, are assigned to its employees playing the role of cargo managers, inspectors, etc.\nAs mentioned before, (§ 5.3), the CDDSAT Simulation model-base is more of a lowlevel or a combination of an Operational Model and Real-time Analytical Models which entail mathematical calculations on the written data to the DB file(s). These files are stored for future use on each progressive phase of the SAT algorithm according to scenarios.\nAssociated requirements for the inspector to scan and suggest which cargo to inspect, is displayed by the program after stack population is inputted. Then, with a simple “Run Scan” button, the user gets a list of 3 containers per phase operation, detecting damages from the undamaged.\nFrom an AI viewpoint, The information gathering part by DB’s plays an important role, say, when the same cargo list is suggested with similar damaged vs. undamaged results on the profile, the program skips the same configuration of detections (leaving out unnecessary program routines) and gives a high probability to the inspector that what is going to be the outcome before running a formal inspection!\nFor instance, if A2, E2, B2 cargo stacks, turn out to be Red, Orange and Orange in a population of 200 cargo stacks based on previous damage estimates on nearby stacks A1, D1 and B1, we could estimate the same outcome for a new population input having the same configuration of damage points. Now, assume that all data points are averaged\n24 | P a g e\nin terms of their surface damages close to a newly suggested of cargos in a larger population > 200. The algorithm, then knows that the outcome of the same stacks in the new population is the same as the one recorded in the past on A2, E2 and B2 for a particular scenario e.g., radiation. The level of exposure and its progress is similar, if the record on these labels were previously stored for the same scenario in the database. So, the scenario type, local configuration of stacks (its topology) similar to the previous profiles, most likely gives the similar outcome in SAT operations."

Based\non our sensitivity quantitative analysis [6], the\nmodel precludes the negative quality of\nprocessing information (qualitative) in favor\nof positive results between detectors\ninstalled on the system excluding human\nagents (only considering software and\ndetectors). On the other hand, the system is\nsensitive to the qualitative performance when\nit comes to servicing the managers with fast\ndata-read relative to delivering reliable\nestimates on time. Therefore, the sensitive\ndata that infer to the actual input data from\nsensory units (detectors) are tested on a trial\nbasis that could reveal any uncertainties in\nthe inspection process. This exactly complies\nwith the notion stating that “If results are\nconsistent it provides stronger evidence of an\neffect and of generalizability” (Leamer, 1978)\n[6]. To this account, the “consistency” is\nanchored in the time parameter representing\na full detection quantified by time of effort\nand processed in a qualitative manner to\nhuman agents. The latter must convey to the\ndelivery of information and the estimates\nmade on damaged vs. undamaged cargos,\nquestioning the fact that whether this profile\ndisplays reliable estimates (information) to\nthe manager or inspector in a real-time\nsituation. We have computed and compared\nthis aspect with other algorithms along the\ndimension of time relative to resource\nallocation for reliable estimates by\nmaintaining performance under different\ncircumstances of cargo inspection:"

Of course, this resulted in\nassessing and tackling Uncertainties in the\nproject. It further resulted in Verification\nand Validation of our incorporated\ntechnique. The most influencing parameter\nwas time raised in the denominator part of\nour equations i.e. the cargo stack population\nbeing processed by the system is measured\nwith respect to time during code executions.\nFor precise measurements, the length of\ncode execution paths, program volume,\ndifficulty and length, we could use Halstead\ncomplexity measurement indeed [8]. However,\nin our hybrid prototype, typical time functions\nwere used and summed from one execution\nstep to another. For instance, in VB, we code\n1. ‘The following creates a timer variable to compute the elapsed time interval per\nan invoked operation\n2. StartTime = Timer()\n3. ... ‘this is where all the code subsists and thus timed 4. EndTime = Timer() ‘this is where the timer finishes timing 5. Me.Text1.text = FormatNumber(EndTime - StartTime, 2) ‘A text box displays the\nelapsed time result down to 2 decimal points on the same form object\n6. Debug.Print ‘print elapsed time output\nThe last line is then saved or displayed as part\nof the total elapsed time of the whole SAT\noperation executed by the other compiled\ncodes in C++ and Java. Then, at the end of all\noperations of the simulation program, the\n“total time” T, is measured and compared to\nthe contributed TD of the program. If T is lost\ncompared to Tother, we say that SAT acted\ninefficiently; otherwise, it is always Tsaved ,\naccording to our simulation results. Meaning\nthat, the detections and processing lengths\nare all done and measured in terms of time.\nThe following graph shows how much\ntime we have totally saved on a random\nscenario for each inputted cargo population\nto the system during optimization, without\nincluding learnability features as explained in\n§ 6.2. It shows in all scenarios we have saved\nat least 80 seconds depending on the\n26 | P a g e\ncaptured image from the cargo scene, as well\nas 3D scattering, surface and contour\nmapping technique with relative activities\nperformed by agents on the containers. The\nradiation scenario of the project was not\ncovered but considered throughout the\ndesign, since it requires a reliable dataset as\nour sample to be loaded, used, processed and\ntested by our system, averaging radiation\nunits indicating exposure, thereby generating\ncolor-coded red, orange and green results as\nspecified in our design.\nWe have tested and retested the\nsimulation to conclude our results in form of\nDB tables and time measurement. We ought\nto prove that the SAT algorithm is quite useful\nin terms of its usability, maintainability,\nfunctionality, efficiency, portability and\ninformation integrity, based on I/O database\nand management. For instance, the system\nuser is not overwhelmed with inputting a\nvariety of data to the system (e.g. complicated\nforms to fill-in) and mainly deals with a\nsimple interface to either relay actual data via\nsensors on cargo relative to giving an input\non just population (passing an argument n\nonly) to the system. The rest is the system’s\nduty to process, analyze and update the given\ninformation between relay points. The results\nof the test are quite lucid in ISO-25010\nsoftware quality characteristics [7], prior to\nquantitative analysis, which has been\nconducted in the first place during the\nprogramming phases of the application.\nThe ‘concurrent scans’ curve in Fig. 10,\nrepresents “3 detections by the α, β, γ\ndetectors” which generated approximately\nTD/3 when the “concurrent scan” option was\nchosen on the prototype. This shows that\ncompared to a “sequential scanning” by\ndefault (running one detector at a time) in the\nprogram, a significant time reduction is\nachieved for better performance. Therefore,\nFig. 9 is transformed into Fig. 10, showing this\noptimization by result.\n27 | P a g e\nThis of course, is achieved by parallel\nprogramming with manageably-running\nmultiple threads on the processor (coded in\nthe detections’ simulation part in VB.NET), to\nmanage time sessions or application slices of\ntasks allocated to process incoming imagery\ndata from the detectors. As a minimum\nrequirement, having a dual-core CPU, of\ncourse, satisfies this spawning of threads\nduring program execution. Of course,\naccording to ISO 25010, nowadays computers\nall are at least equipped with dual-core CPUs\nsatisfying the usability aspect relative to\naffordability and cost effective issues within\nthe software engineering quality\ncharacteristics [7]."

      "text" : "In this project, we have managed to run\nthe simulation on different scenarios. The\nscenarios were simulated in terms of xy local\ndamage estimates relative to xyz cargo\nsurface detection scenarios, initially gathered\nfrom the cargo environment, once a set of\ncontainers are suggested by the CDD-SAT\nsystem to the inspector. In particular:\nprobable rusty and oxidized surfaces of\ncontainers against undamaged ones, whereas\ntheir outcomes are stored in {Red OR Orange\nOR Green}. This constituted the verdict\ncoming from the system to profile the status\nof the triangulated cargos. Similarly, probable\npunctured walls or walls with holes against\nundamaged ones were also simulated.\nConcurrent detections processed by the\nprogram satisfying 3 incoming detections\nfrom the scene for surface damage analysis,\nproved how fast the system works.\nHowever, probable radiation exposure was\nconsidered, but not covered due to in need of\ntrying an actual dataset (as the supervisor L.\nHenesey indicated to provide us), which varies\nin short time intervals in any situation. For\ninstance, based on Roentgen radiation unit\ncounts per minute (cpm), the rate of exposure\ncompared to the rate on other scenarios like\nrusty container surfaces stationed in some hot-\nhumid environment, is high, and the scale of its\nspread to elsewhere is quite evident, whereas\nthe other scenario is deemed to be a long term\nissue co-occurring between the two scenarios.\nWe have animated our Use-Case\nDiagrams entailing surface detection plus xy\ntriangulations on local stack population n,\nwhere the Outcomes were sorted in {Red OR\nOrange OR Green} accordingly. This\n28 | P a g e\nconstituted our database I/O results, thus\nour profile results on the cargo for the whole\nstack population. Time Length Calculations +\nOptimization Issues were discussed and show\na significant upgrade in making reliable\ndecisions on time compared to other\nalgorithms. To this account, the discussion of\nthe most dominant factors in this IDSS project\nbecomes relevant: stack population, its data\nacquisition, detection process, and local\ndamage detection sorting with respect to\ntime. In our conclusions, we claim that the\nCDD-SAT’s current usage as an IDSS solution\nis relevant to “prediction scenarios” based on\nreliable estimates on damaged vs. undamaged\ncargos. This makes inspections quite fast at\nthe port and elsewhere. Nevertheless,\nuncertainties and certain influential factors\ne.g., cargo environment, human interactions,\ntransportation status, atmospheric impact,\netc. always remain visible in our real-world\nrelationships."

Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc. The system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection. This new technique saves time and money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of running n inspections on n containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation or a ratio of 3:n is required, assuming n > 3 containers. The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actuallydamaged cargo by calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population. The estimated values on damaged, somewhat damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision. The report describes the problem domain and the implementation of the simulator prototype, showing how the system operates via software, hardware with/without human agents, conducting real-time inspections and management per se.",
