      "text" : "Discriminative supervised classifiers have proved to be very accurate data-driven tools for learning the relationship between input variables and certain labels. Usually, for these methods to work, the labeling of the training data needs to be complete and precise. However, in many practical situations, this requirement is impossible to meet because of the challenges posed by the acquisition of detailed data annotations. This typically leads to partial or ambiguous labelings.\nDifferent weakly supervised methods have been proposed to tackle this issue. In the semi-supervised framework (Chapelle et al., 2006), only a small number of points are labeled, and the goal is to use the unlabeled points to improve the performance of the classifier. In the multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework introduced by Dietterich & Lathrop (1997), bags of instances are labeled together instead of individually, and some instances belonging to the same bag\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nmay have different true labels. Finally, in the ambiguous labeling setting (Jin & Ghahramani, 2003; Hullermeier & Beringer, 2006), each point is associated with multiple potential labels.\nMore generally, in all these frameworks, the points are associated with observable partial labels and the implicit or explicit goal is to jointly estimate their true latent labels and learn a classifier based on these labels. This usually leads to a non-convex cost function which is often optimized with a greedy method or a coordinate descent algorithm such as the expectationmaximization (EM) procedure. These methods usually converge to a local minimum, and their initialization remains an open practical problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a simple and general framework which can be used for any of the aforementioned problems. We explicitly learn the true latent label and the classifier parameters. We also propose a convex relaxation of our cost function and an efficient algorithm to minimize it. More precisely, we use a discrimative classifier with a soft-max loss, and our convex relaxation extends the work of Guo & Schuurmans (2008). Our main contributions are:\n• a full convex relaxation of the soft-max loss function with intercept, which can be applied to a large set of multiclass problems with any level of supervision,\n• a novel convex cost function for weakly supervised and unsupervised problems and,\n• a dedicated and efficient optimization procedure.\nWe develop our framework for the general weakly supervised case. We propose results on both toy examples as proof of concept of our claims, and on standard MIL and semi-supervised learning (SSL) datasets."

      "text" : "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has received much attention because of its wide range of applications. First used for drug activity prediction, it has also been used in the vision community for different problems such as scene classification (Maron & Ratan,\n1998), object detection (Viola et al., 2006), object tracking in video (Babenko et al., 2009), and image database retrieval (Yang, 2000). Many MIL methods have been developed in the past decade. For example, some are based on boosting (Auer & Ortner, 2004), others on nearest neighbors (Wang & Zucker, 2000), on neural networks (Zhang & Zhou, 2006), on decision trees (Blockeel et al., 2005), or the construction of an appropriate kernel (Wang et al., 2008; Gärtner et al., 2002; Kwok & Cheung, 2007). Much of the work in the MIL community has focused on the use of discriminative classifiers, the most popular one being the support vector machine (SVM) (Andrews et al., 2003; Chen & Wang, 2004; Gehler & Chapelle, 2007). In this paper, we concentrate on the logisitic loss which makes little difference with the hinge loss with the additional advantage of being twice differentiable. Note that this loss has already been used in the context of MIL (Xu & Frank, 2004; Ray & Craven, 2005), but with different optimization schemes.\nMany semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have also been proposed in the past decade (see, e.g., Chapelle et al., 2006; Zhu, 2006). For example, some are based on maximizing the margin with an SVM framework (Joachims, 1999; Bennett & Demiriz, 1998; Xu & Schuurmans, 2005), and others use the unlabeled data for regularization (Belkin et al., 2004) or co-training of weak classifiers (Blum & Mitchell, 1998).\nDiscriminative clustering provides a principled way to reuse existing supervised learning machinery while explicitly estimating the latent labels. For example, following the SVM approach of Xu et al. (2005), algorithms using linear discriminant analysis (De la Torre & Takeo, 2006) or ridge regression (Bach & Harchaoui, 2007) have been proposed. These methods often fail in the multiclass case, whereas we show that the soft-max loss with intercept works well in this setting. A common issue for discriminative clustering is that a perfect separation is reached by assigning the same label to all of the points. In most of the previously cited methods, this issue is adressed by adding linear constraints on the size of each cluster. In this paper we use instead a natural cluster-size balancing term corresponding to an entropy penalization (Chapelle et al., 2006; Joulin et al., 2010).\nThe link between SSL and MIL has been widely studied in the community. For example, in the context of image segmentation with text annotation, Barnard et al. (2003) propose a general weakly supervised model based on a multi-modal extension to a mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation. An important issue with this family of generative models is that learning the parameters is often untractable. Another example is Zhou & Xu (2007) who use the relation between MIL and SSL to develop a method for MIL.\nThe idea of using a convex cost function in the weakly supervision context has been already studied in different contexts such as, for example, ambiguous labeling (Cour et al., 2009) or discriminative clustering (Xu et al., 2005; Bach & Harchaoui, 2007). In this paper, we are interested in the convex relaxation of a general multiclass loss function, i.e., the soft-max loss. Guo & Schuurmans (2008) propose a related relaxation but do not consider the intercept in the linear classifier. We extend their work to the case of linear classifiers with an intercept and show in the experiment section, why this difference is crucial when it comes to classification. Note that by using kernels, we can use non-linear classifiers as well. Also, our dedicated optimization scheme is more scalable than the one developed in Guo & Schuurmans (2008) and could be applied to their problem as well."

      "text" : "We suppose that we observe I bags of instances. For i in {1, . . . , I}, Ni is the set of instances in the i-th bag, and Ni = |Ni| is its cardinality. We denote by N = ∑\ni Ni the total number of instances. In each bag i, an instance n in Ni is associated with a feature xn ∈ X and a label yn in L, in certain feature and label space. In this paper, we suppose that this label is common to all the instances of a same bag and explain only partially the instances contained in the bag. We are thus interested in finding a latent label zn ∈ P which would give a better understanding of the data. We denote by P and L the cardinalities of P and L. We also assume that the latent label zn of an instance n can only take its values in a subset Pyn of P which depends on the label yn of the bag. The variables yn and zn are associated with their canonical vectorial representation, i.e., znp = 1 if the instance n has a latent label of p and 0 otherwise. We denote by z the N × P matrix with rows zn.\nInstance reweighting. In many problems, a set of instances can be bigger than the other, this is the case for example in a one-vs-all classifer where the number of positive instances is often very small compared to the number of negative examples. A side-contribution of this work is to consider explicitly a reweighting of the data to avoid undesired side effects: Each point is associated with a weight πn ≥ 0 which denotes its importance compared to others. Some examples are the uniform case, i.e., πn = 1 N or when bags have to be reweighted, i.e., πn = 1\nINi for n in the bag i. We\ndenote by π the vector with entries equal to πn. Note that π ≥ 0 and ∑\nn πn = 1.\nThis setting is very general, so let us now show how it applies to several concrete settings.\nSemi-supervised learning. Given a set of true labels P and Nl points with known label, there are Nl+1 bags, i.e., one for each labeled point and one for all the unlabeled instances. The set L is equal to P plus a label for the unlabeled bag (i.e., L = P + 1). The true label of an instance in a positive bag is fixed whereas in the unlabeled bag it can take any value in P.\nUnsupervised learning. This is an extreme case of the semi-supervised framework with only the unlabeled bag.\nMultiple instance learning. There are two possible labels for a bag (L = 2), i.e., positive (yn = 1) or negative (yn = 0). The true label zn of an instance n in a negative bag is necessarily negative (zn = 0) and in a positive bag it can be either positive or negative (P1 = {0, 1}).\nAmbiguous labelling. Each bag is associated with a set of possible true labels Pl. The set of partial labels is thus the combination of all possible subsets of P, i.e., each label l ∈ L represents a subset of P (L = 2P )."

      "heading" : "2.2. Problem formulation",
      "text" : "The goal of a discriminative weakly supervised classifier is to find the latent labels z that minimize the value of a regularized discriminative loss function. More precisely, given some latent label z and some feature map φ : X 7→ IRd (note that φ could be explicitly defined or implicitly given through a positive-definite kernel), we train a multi-class discriminative classifier to find the parameters w ∈ IRP×d and b ∈ IRP that minimize:\nL(z, w, b) =\nN ∑\nn=1\nπnℓ(zn, w Tφ(xn) + b),\nwhere ℓ : IRP × IRP 7→ IR is a loss function. In this paper, we are interested in the multi-class setting where a natural choice for ℓ is the soft-max loss function (Hastie et al., 2001). Note that for a given instance n, the set of possible true labels depends on the the label y of its bag, our loss function ℓ(zn, w Tφ(xn) + b) then takes the following form:\n− ∑\nl∈L\nynl ∑\np∈Pl\nznp log\n( exp(wTp φ(xn) + bp) ∑\nk∈Pl exp(wTk φ(xn) + bk)\n)\n,\nwhere wTp is the p–th row of w T and bp the p–th entry of b.\nCluster-size balancing term. In many unsupervised or weakly supervised problems, a common issue is that assigning the same label to all the instances leads to perfect separation. In the MIL community, this is equivalent to considering all the bags as negative and a common solution is to add a non-convex constraint which enforces at least one point per positive bag to be positive. Another solution used in\nthe discriminative clustering community is to add constraints on the number of elements per class and per bag (Xu et al., 2005; Bach & Harchaoui, 2007). Despite good results, this solution introduces extra parameters and may be hard to extend to other frameworks such as MIL, where a positive bag may not have any negative instances. Another common technique is to encourage the proportion of points per class and per bag to be close to uniform. An appropriate penalty term for achieving this is the entropy (i.e., h(v) = − ∑\nk vk log(vk)) of the proportions of points per bag and per latent label, leading to:\nH(z) = ∑\ni∈I\nh\n(\n∑\nn∈Ni\nπnzn\n)\n.\nPenalizing by this entropy turns out to be equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of a graphical model where the features xn explain the labels yn through the latent labels zn (Joulin et al., 2010). An important consequence is that the natural weight of this penalty in the cost function is 1, so we do not add any extra parameters.\nTo avoid over-fitting, we penalize the norm of w, leading to the following cost function:\nf(z, w, b) = L(z, w, b)−H(z) + λ\n2P ‖w‖2F ,\nwhere λ > 0 is the regularization parameter and the problem thus takes the following form:\nmin ∀n≤N, zn∈SPyn min w∈IRd×P , b∈IRP f(z, w, b), (1)\nwhere SP = {t ∈ IR P | t ≥ 0, tT 1P = 1} is the simplex in IRP . To avoid cumbersome double subscripts, we suppose that any instance n in a bag with a label yn (which is common to the entire bag), has a latent label zn in P instead of Pyn .\nIn the next section we show how to obtain a convex relaxation of this problem."

      "text" : "An interesting feature of the soft-max cost function is its link to the entropy through the Fenchel conjugate (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2003), i.e., given a P - dimensional vector t, the log-partition can be written as log (\n∑P p=1 exp(tp)\n)\n= maxv∈SP ∑P p=1 vptp + h(v).\nSubstituting in the loss function, the weakly supervised problem defined in Eq. (1) can be reformulated as:\nmin z∈SN\nP\nmax q∈SN\nP\n∑\ni∈I\n∑\nn∈Ni\nπnh(qn)−H(z) + g(z, q), (2)\nwhere q is an N × P matrix with n-th row qTn , and g(z, q) is equal to:\nmin w∈IRP×d\nb∈IRP\n∑\ni∈I\n∑\nn∈Ni\nπn(qn − zn) T (wTφ(xn) + b) +\nλ\n2P ‖w‖2F .\nMinimizing this function w.r.t. the intercept b leads to an intercept constraint on the dual variables, i.e, (q − z)Tπ = 0. The minimization w.r.t. w leads to a closed-form expression for g:\ng(z, q) = − P\n2λ tr ( (q − z)(q − z)TK ) ,\nwhere K is the positive definite kernel matrix associated with the reweighted mapping φ, i.e., with entries equal to Knm = πnφ(xn)\nTφ(xm)πm. The cost function is not convex in general in z since it is the maximum over a set indexed by q of concave functions in z. A common way of dealing with this issue is to relax the problem into a semidefinite program (SDP) in zzT . Unfortunately, our cost function does not directly depend on zzT , but a reparametrization in terms of q inspired by Guo & Schuurmans (2008) allows us to get around this technical difficulty.\nReparametrization in q. We reparametrize the problem by introducing an N × N matrix Ω such that q = Ωz (Guo & Schuurmans, 2008). The intercept constraint and the normalization constraint on q (i.e., q1K = 1N ) become constraints over Ω, i.e., respectively ΩTπ = π and Ω1N = 1N . Translating the addition of an intercept to a linear classifier into a simple constraint on the columns of Ω provides a significant improvement over Guo & Schuurmans (2008), as shown in Section 5.1. This reparametrization has the side-effect of introducing a non-convex term in the cost function since the entropies over qn in Eq. (2) is replaced by an entropy over the n–th row of Ωz which is not jointly concave/convex in Ω and z.\nTight upper-bound on the entropy. We show in the supplementary material that the entropy in q can be bounded by a difference of entropy in Ω and z, up to an additive constant C0:\n∑\ni∈I\n∑\nn∈Ni\nπnh(qn) ≤ − ∑\nn\nπnh(Ωn) +H(z) + C0. (3)\nThis upper-bound is tight in the sense that given a discrete value of z (i.e., before the relaxation), the maximum of the left part among discrete values of q is equal to the maximum of the right part among corresponding discrete values of Ω. Note also that the term in z appearing in Eq. (3) cancels out with the entropy term\nin Eq. (2). This relaxation leads to the minimizition of the following function of z:\nmax Ω∈O\n− P\n2λ tr ( zzT (I − Ω)TK(I − Ω) ) − ∑\nn\nπnh(Ωn),\nwhere O = {Ω | Ω1N = 1N , ΩTπ = π, Ω ≥ 0}. This problem depends on z solely through the matrix zzT , and can thus be relaxed into an SDP in zzT .\nReparametrization in z. With the change of variable Z = zzT , we have the maximum of a set of linear functions of Z, which is convex. However, the set Z of possible values for Z is non-convex since it is defined by:\n{\ndiag(Z) = 1N , Z ≥ 0, Z 0, rank(Z) = k − 1. (4)\nLet us review these constraints:\n• In practice, the piecewise-positivity constraint is not necessary and removing it leads to a matrix Z with entries in [−1, 1] since Z is positive semidefinite with ones on the diagonal.\n• The rank constraint is the main source of nonconvexity, and will be removed, thus leading to a convex relaxation.\n• The rest of the constraints defines the elliptope:\nEN = {Z ∈ IR N×N | diag(Z) = 1N , Z 0}.\nNote that an additional linear constraint may be needed depending on the considered weakly supervised problem. We give below some examples:\n• In the case of MIL, this constraint takes the form of Z− = 1N−1 T N− , where N− is the number of\nnegative examples, and Z− is the restriction of Z to the negative bags.\n• “Must-not-link” constraints on the instances can be handled: If two bags i and j have labels yi and yj such that the set of possible latent labels are dissimilar (i.e., Pli ∩ Plj = ∅), we can constrain the submatrix Zij to be equal to 0. These constraints are of particular interest in the case of SSL, where labeled bags with different labels should not be assigned to the same latent label.\nIn the rest of this paper, we consider the specific cases of SSL, MIL and discriminative clustering:\n• In SSL, we can reduce the dimensionality of Z: Since all the values of z with a same known label are equal, it is equivalent to replace them by a\nsingle element in Z. Denoting by Nu is the number of unlabeled points, P the number of labels and NR = Nu + P , this is equivalent to considering a matrix RTZR instead of Z, where R is a N × NR matrix whose restriction to the unlabeled bags is the identity and all other entries are zero except for Rn(Nu+l) which is equal to 1 if the instance n has a known label l.\n• In MIL, the same reduction can be done with P = 1 and Nu denoting the total number of positive instances.\n• Discriminative clustering is similar to SSL with P = 0.\nBy taking into account all of these modifications and by dropping the rank constraint, we replace the nonconvex set Z by the elliptope ENR , leading to the minimization of g(Z) over ENR , where g(Z) is equal to:\nmax Ω∈O\n− P\n2λ tr ( ZR(I − Ω)TK(I − Ω)RT ) − ∑\nn\nπnh(Ωn).

Many approaches have been proposed to solve this type of problems (Goemans & Williamson, 1995; Burer & Monteiro, 2003; Journée et al., 2010) but, to the best of our knowledge, they all assume that the function and its gradient can be computed efficiently and put the emphasis on the projection. This is not the case in our problem, and we thus propose a method adapted to our particular setting.\nFirst, to simplify the projection on the ENR , we replace our cost function g(Z) by its diagonally rescaled version gR(Z) = g(diag(Z)\n−1/2Zdiag(Z)−1/2). Note that even if this function is in general non-convex, it coincides with g(Z) on ENR , making its restriction to this set convex. This modification allows us to rescale the diagonal of any update Z to a diagonal equal to 1N without modifying the value of our cost function.\nOur minimization of gR over the elliptope is also based on a proximal method with a Bregman divergence to guarantee updates that stay in the feasible set. A natural choice for the Bregman divergence is the KL divergence based on the von Neumann entropy, i.e, the entropy of the eigenvalues of a matrix (see more details in the supplementary material). This divergence guarantees that each update has nonnegative eigenvalues. Given a point Z0, its update can then be obtained in closed-form as the diagonally rescaled version of VDiag(exp(diag( 1tE)))V\nT , where V and E are the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of −∇gR(Z0)+t log(Z0) and t is a positive step size computed using a line-search with backtracking.\nAs in the inner loop, we use a computationnally tractable provable duality gap, i.e., −NRλmin, where λmin is the lowest eigenvalue of ∇gR(Z) (see details in the supplementary material)."

The latter comparison is relevant since they propose a convex cost function based on the square loss with intercept.\nWe consider in Figure 2, as a proof of concept, two toy examples where the goal is to find 3 and 5 clusters with linear kernels and N = 500.

We believe that convex relaxation is a powerful tool to obtain good initializations to non-convex problems.

Inferring the labels and learning the parameters of the model is usually done jointly through a block-coordinate descent algorithm such as expectation-maximization (EM), which may lead to local minima. To avoid this problem, we propose a cost function based on a convex relaxation of the soft-max loss. We then propose an algorithm specifically designed to efficiently solve the corresponding semidefinite program (SDP). Empirically, our method compares favorably to standard ones on different datasets for multiple instance learning and semi-supervised learning, as well as on clustering tasks.",
