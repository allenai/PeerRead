      "text" : "2 | P a g e\nStudent dropout prediction is an indispensable for numerous intelligent systems to measure the education system and success rate of any university as well as throughout the university in the world. Therefore, it becomes essential to develop efficient methods for prediction of the students at risk of dropping out, enabling the adoption of proactive process to minimize the situation. Thus, this research work propose a prototype machine learning tool which can automatically recognize whether the student will continue their study or drop their study using classification technique based on decision tree and extract hidden information from large data about what factors are responsible for dropout student. Further the contribution of factors responsible for dropout risk was studied using discriminant analysis and to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among significant datasets, Association rule mining was applied. In this study, the descriptive statistics analysis was carried out to measure the quality of data using SPSS 20.0 statistical software and application of decision tree and association rule were carried out by using WEKA data mining tool. Based on the application of association rule, the highest support value 0.68 was recorded for dropout mainly because of the personal problem. On the other hand ID3 decision tree algorithm was found best classifier with 98% accuracy whereas, discriminant function analysis correctly classified 99.1% of original grouped cases and 98.6% of cross-validated grouped cases. The main reason recorded for dropout of students at this residential university were personal factor ( illness & homesickness), Educational factors (learning problems & difficult courses, change of Institution with present goal and low placement rate) and institutional factors (campus environment, too many rules in hostel life and poor entertainment facilities).\nKeywords: Data mining, Dropout, Prediction, machine learning algorithm, classification, decision tree, Discriminant Analysis, Association Rule, Apriori algorithm\n3 | P a g e"

      "text" : "We live in the information- era, accumulating data is easy and storing it inexpensive. Today the amount of stored information increases day by day in all areas. Unfortunately, as the amount of machine readable information increases, the ability to understand and make use of it does not keep pace with its growth. Stored data can be used to generate useful information for decision making. The data mining can be applied in various real life applications like market analysis, education, and scientific exploration, etc. [18].\nIf data is rich in quality and quantity then reliable information hidden in the data can be generated. To generate relevant information from the data which have stored in the repositories over the years, Data mining tools and techniques is used. Data mining is an automatic data analysis process that helps users and administrators to discover and extract patterns from stored data. The use of data mining technique to analyze an educational database is absolutely expected to be great benefit to the higher educational institutions.\nEducation is one of the social factors whereby gender disparity is reflected. The number and proportion of educated females is very low. As the grade level of education increases, the number of female students starts to decline. Consequently, higher education remains the level of learning where females are less represented both as students and staff [52]. The very few women that are fortunate enough to join higher learning institutions can be characterized by lower academic performance and higher forced withdrawal. Female education in India has got momentum after independence. There has been slow development in technical fields, but during the recent past, the continuation of female students in technical as well as in almost every field has envisaged higher status, still due to several factors there has been comparatively lesser percentage of female education as per national statistics conducted by HRD, Govt. of India. Hence, to develop a strong base of interest among female population in the country to prosecute higher education breaking the barrier of gender psychology towards which Banasthali University has played significant role. Since inception in 1935, the university has played major role in educating girl\n8 | P a g e\nstudents from primary level to higher studies being undertaken from students coming from different parts of the country. As per need of the present education and employment scenario, the university has restructured its traditional educational system and introduced professional courses in the field of Engineering, Law, Management, Information & Communication Technology, Applied and pure science and Teacher’s Education at undergraduate and postgraduate level. However the reasons for still shortfall in number by female students are a matter of study from various socio-economic considerations which is of great significance being undertaken both from academic and national interest under present study. Since Banasthali University is promoting mainly female education, it is more appropriate to conduct such study at this university where female students from composite strata come for high aspiration.\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to study the student’s dropout risk assessment and causes of dropout at undergraduate level using data mining tool and techniques to assist the student dropout program on campus. Information like grade in High School, grade in Senior Secondary, student’s family income, qualification of parent’s etc. were collected from the student’s residing in university campus, to predict the students drop out rate who need special attention."

      "text" : "“Data mining”, often known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), refers to mining knowledge from immense amount of data [18]. Data mining techniques are used to operate on huge amount of data to discover hidden patterns and relationships helpful for decision making. While data mining and KDD are frequently treated as synonyms, actually data mining is a part of the knowledge discovery process. The data mining defined as “the non trivial process of identifying valid, novel, previously unknown, potentially useful information, and ultimately understandable patterns from data in database” [53]. Finding a useful patterns in data are known by different names in different communities (e.g. Knowledge extraction, Information discovery, data dredging, data archeology, Information harvesting, data/pattern analysis and business intelligence) [53].\n9 | P a g e"

      "heading" : "1.1.2 Data Mining Functionalities",
      "text" : "Functionalities of data mining are as follows-\n Characterization\nData characterization is a summarization of the general characteristics or features of objects in a target class of data. Relevant data to a user- specified class are collected by a database query and run through a summarization module to extract the essence of the data at different level of abstractions. For example, to study the characteristics of software products whose sales increased by 10% in the last year, one can collect the data related to such product by executing an SQL query. There are several methods for effective data summarization and characterization such as roll-up, drill –up, drill-down, slice, and dice.\n Discrimination\nData discrimination is a comparison of the general features of target class data objects with the general features of objects from one or a set of contrasting class. For example, compare the general feature of software products whose sale increased by 10% in the last year with those whose sales decreased by at least 30% during the same period. Discrimination descriptions expressed in rule form are referred to as discriminant rules.\n Association Analysis\nAssociation analysis is the discovery of association rules. It studies the frequency of items take place together in transactional databases based on threshold called support and confidence. Association analysis is commonly used for market basket analysis. The discovery of association rule can help\n10 | P a g e\nretailers to develop marketing strategies by gaining into which items are frequently purchase together. For example- age (X,”20-29”)^F_income (X,”10-20k”) => dropout (X, “Yes”) [Support= 2%, confidence=60%] Rule implies that 2%(support) are 20-29 year of age with an family income of 10-20k generally drop their study and 60% probability(confidence) that a student in this age and income group will withdraw from their study.\n Classification and Prediction\nClassification analyzes a set of training data and builds a model for each class based on the features in the data. This model is used to classify new objects and also known as supervised learning. Derived model may be represented in various forms, such as classification (IF- THEN) rules, decision trees, and neural network etc. A decision tree is a flow –chart like tree structure where each node denotes a test on an attribute value and each branch represents an outcome of the test. A neural network is a collection of linear threshold units that can be trained to distinguish objects of different classes. Classification can be used to predicting the class label of data objects. Classification predicts categorical labels (or discrete values), prediction models continuous- valued function. For example, a classification model may be built to categorize bank loan application as either safe or risky, while predication model may be built to predict the expenditure of potential customer equipment given their income and occupation.\n Clustering\nClustering is an unsupervised learning, in which the class labels of the training samples are not known. Cluster is a collection of data objects that are similar to on one another. Similarity can be expressed by distance functions, specified by use experts. A good clustering method produces high quality clusters to ensure that inter- cluster (object of different class) similarity is low and the intra-cluster (object in a same class) similarity is high.\n Evolution and Deviation Analysis\nEvolution and deviation analysis pertain to the study, trend of object whose behavior changes over time. Evolution analysis models evolutionary trends in data, where as Deviation analysis, considers differences between measured values and expected values.\n11 | P a g e"

Educational data mining is the application of data mining. It is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that deals with the development of methods to explore data originating in an educational context. Educational data mining is an emerging trend, designed for automatically exploring the unique types of data from large repositories of educationally related data. Quite often, this data is extensive, fine- grained, and precise.\nThe Educational Data Mining community defines EDM as follows: Educational data mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from educational settings, and using those methods to better understand students, and the settings in which they learn. Data mining is the field of discovery novel and potentially useful information from extraction huge amount of data. We know that large amount of data stored in database, so in order get the required data and to find the hidden relationship, different data mining techniques are used such as classification, prediction, association rule, outlier detection etc. EDM focuses on collection, archiving, and analysis of data related to student’s learning and assessment.\nEDM include analysis (evaluation/ exploration) of educational processes including admission, alumni relations, course selections, predicting drop out student, student’s success rate, course success rate, performance evaluation of student, learning behavior of students, list of course taken by the student, when the student selected or changed his or her academic major, finding which tasks, courses etc are difficult/ easy for which student’s, finding elective courses often taken by student’s."

Data analysis is one way to scale down the rate of dropout students and increase the enrollment rate of students in the university.

The rate of student’s dropout in the residential university depends on the educational system adopted by the University. The needs of current research are as follows:\n12 | P a g e\n Predicting dropout students at an early stage of the degree program help\nmanagement not only to concentrate more on the bright students but also to apply more efforts in developing programs for the weaker ones in order to improve their progress while attempting to avoid student dropouts.

      "heading" : "1.4 Social Implication of this Research",
      "text" : "The larger number of dropout in the higher education has serious consequences for our society. Dropouts experiences high level of unemployment and receive lower earning than graduates [54]. Dropouts are also more likely than graduates to become dependent on welfare, engage in illegal activities, and experience health and affective problems [54, 55, 13]. Finally, high rate of dropping out of higher education create a negative momentum for youths in a society, particularly during difficult economic periods when a high school diploma does not guarantee a job. Such momentum may foster even higher dropout rates in the future. To overcome these issues this research work will be quite helpful. To reduce the rate of dropout or predict student who need special attention, we need to focus on parental support, personal and family factor, environment of campus, and quality of education.\nThe findings of this case study focus an outline to the policymakers with an overview of research about the dropout problem and the best strategies for building an early warning system that can signal which factors / institutions are most in need of controlling dropout problem. On the other hand, the study will also be helpful for the guardian of the students to understand the internal and the external reasons of dropout and to give them an idea about their role to minimize dropout at different levels of students. An effective measure to control dropout will significantly improve our overall education system and the nation as a whole will be benefited from it.\n13 | P a g e"

Some of the important studies are as follows:\nAlaa el-Halees [3], studied how data mining is useful to improve the performance of the student in higher education. For this study association rule, classification rule using decision tree was used for analysis.\nAl-Radaideh et al. [4], applied classification data mining techniques to improve the quality of the higher education by evaluating the main attributes of students that affect the their performance. This study was used to predict the student’s final grade in a course.\nAyesha et.al. [5], performed study on student learning behavior. For this factors like class quizzes mid and final exam assignment are studied. This study will help the tutors to reduce the ratio of drop out and improve the performance level of students.\nBharadwaj and Pal [6], used the decision tree method for classification to evaluate performance of student’s. The objective of their study is to discover knowledge that describes students’ performance in end semester examination. This study was quite useful for identifying the dropout’s student in earlier stage and students who need special attention and allow the teacher to provide appropriate advising.\nBharadwaj and Pal [7], conducted study on the student performance based by selecting 300 students from 5 different degree college conducting BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) course of Dr. R. M. L. Awadh University, Faizabad, India. By means of Bayesian classification method on 17 attributes, it was found that the factors like students grade in senior secondary exam, living location, medium of teaching, mother’s qualification, students other habit, family annual income and student’s family status were highly correlated with the student academic performance.\nBoero, Laureti & Naylor [9], they found that gender (males have a higher probability of dropping out relative to the reference group of females) is one of the principal determinants of the probability of dropping out and age has a significant positive effect.\n15 | P a g e\nBray [10], in his study on private tutoring and its implications, observed that the percentage of students receiving private tutoring in India was relatively higher than in Malaysia, Singapore, Japan, China and Sri Lanka. It was also observed that there was an enhancement of academic performance with the intensity of private tutoring and this variation of intensity of private tutoring depends on the collective factor namely socio-economic conditions.\nCesar et al. [11], proposed a recommendation system based to help students to make decisions related to their academic track.\nChandra and Nandhini [12], used the association rule mining analysis to identifies students’ failure patterns. The main objective of their study is to identify hidden relationship between the failed courses and suggests relevant causes of the failure to improve the low capacity students’ performances.\nD’Mello [14] studied on bored and frustrated student.\nEl-Halees [15], proposed a case study that used educational data mining to analyze students’ learning behavior. The objective of his study is to show how useful data mining can be used in higher education to improve student’s performance. They applied data mining techniques to discover relevant information from large database such as association rules and classification rules using decision tree, clustering and outlier analysis.\nFadzilah and Abdullah [16],applied data mining techniques to enrollment data. Descriptive and predictive approaches were used. Cluster analysis was used to group the data into clusters based on their similarities. For predictive analysis, Neural Network, Logistic regression, and the Decision Tree have been used. After evaluating these techniques, Neural Networks classifier was found to give the highest results in term of classification accuracy.\nHijazi and Naqvi [20], conducted as study on the student performance by selecting a sample of 300 students (225 males, 75 females) from a group of colleges affiliated to Punjab university of Pakistan. The hypothesis that was stated as \"Student's attitude towards attendance in class, hours spent in study on daily basis after college, students family income, students mother's age and mother's education are significantly related with student performance” was framed. By means of simple linear regression analysis, it was found that the factors like mother’s education and student’s family\n16 | P a g e\nOladipupo and oyelade [33], perform study using association rule data mining technique to identify student’s failure patterns. They take a total number of 30 courses for 100 levels and 200 levels. Their study focuses on constructive recommendation, curriculum structure and modification in order to improve student’s academic performance and trim down failure rate.\nPandey and Pal [34], conducted study on the student performance based by selecting 60 students from a degree college of Dr. R. M. L. Awadh University, Faizabad, India. By means of association rule they find the interestingness of student in opting class teaching language.\nPathom et al. [35], proposed a classifier algorithm for building Course Registration Planning Model (CRPM) from historical dataset. The algorithm is selected by comparing the performance of four classifiers include Bayesian Network, C4.5, Decision Forest, and NBTree. The dataset were obtained from student enrollments including grade point average (GPA) and grades of undergraduate students. As a result, the NBTree was the best of the four classifiers. NBTree was used to generate the CRPM, which can be used to predict student class of GPA and consider student course sequences for registration planning.\nRamasubramanian et.al.[36], predict aspects of higher education students. In this paper they analyze that one of the biggest challenges that higher education faces today is predicting the behavior of students. Institutions would like to know, something about the performances of the students group wise. He proposed a problem to investigate the performances of the students when the large data base of Students information system (SIS) is given. Generally students’ problems will be classified into different patterns based on the level of students like normal, average and below average. In this paper we attempt to analyze SIS database using rough set theory to predict the future of students.\nRamaswami and Bhaskaran [37], have constructed a predictive model called CHAID with 7-class response variable by using highly influencing predictive variables obtained through feature selection so as to evaluate the academic achievement of students at higher secondary schools in India. Data were collected from different schools of Tamilnadu, 772 students’ records were used for CHAID prediction model construction. As a result, set of rules were extracted from the\n17 | P a g e\nCHAID prediction model and the efficiency was found. The accuracy of the present model was compared with other models and it has been found to be satisfactory.\nRomero and Ventura [38], survey the relevant studies carried out in the field of education. They have described the types of users, types of educational environments and the data they provide. Also they have explained in their work the common tasks in the educational environment that have been resolved through data mining techniques. Romero & Ventura [39], provided a survey of educational data mining from 1995- 2005 and Baker & Yacef (2009) extended their survey covering the latest development until 2009. There are an increasing number of data mining applications in education, from enrollment management, graduation, academic performance, gifted education, web-based education, retention and other areas (Nandeshwar & Chandhari, 2009). In this section we will review only research where the main focus is on study outcome, i.e. successful or unsuccessful course completion. Based on his open learning model Kamber (1995) stated that entry, i.e. background characteristics are not good predictors of final outcomes because they are just a starting point and there are other factors that may contribute to the difficulties student will have to deal with during his/her study. Shaeela Ayesha, Tasleem Mustafa, Ahsan Raza Sattar, and M. Inayat Khan [40] applied K-mean clustering to analyze learning behavior of students which will help the tutor to improve the performance of students and reduce the dropout ratio to a significant level.\nShannaq et al. [41], applied the classification as data mining technique to predict the numbers of enrolled students by evaluating academic data from enrolled students to study the main attributes that may affect the students’ loyalty (number of enrolled students). The extracted classification rules are based on the decision tree as a classification method, the extracted classification rules are studied and evaluated using different evaluation methods. It allows the University management to prepare necessary resources for the new enrolled students and indicates at an early stage which type of students will potentially be enrolled and what areas to concentrate upon in higher education systems for support.\nSun [43], the student learning result evaluation system is an essential tool and approach for monitoring and controlling the learning quality. This paper conducted a\n18 | P a g e\nresearch on student learning result based on data mining. With this model in practice, student learning can become more energetic, more interesting, more challenging, and more suited to the times and this research paper will help to understand student learning evaluation system to generate theories.\nSuperby [45] conducted a study to investigate to determine the factors to be taken into account we will use a model adapted from that of Philippe Parmentier (1994). In other words the idea is to determine if it is possible to predict a decision variable using the explanatory variables which we retained in the model.\nTissera et al. [46], presented a real-world experiment conducted in an ICT educational institute in Sri Lanka, by analyzing students’ performance. They applied a series of data mining task to find relationships between subjects in the undergraduate syllabi. They used association rules to identify possible related two subjects’ combination in the syllabi, and apply correlation coefficient to determine the strength of the relationships of subject combinations identified by association rules. As a result, the knowledge discovered can be used for improving the quality of the educational programs to plain English to be used as a factor to be considered by the managerial system to either support their current decision makings or help them to set new strategies and plan to improve their decision making procedures. The main idea of this analysis is organized into the DM-HEDU guideline proposed by the authors, which targets the superior advantages of data mining in higher learning institution. The authors have presented several projects of using data mining in higher education.\nVandamme, Meskens & Superby [47], used decision trees, neural networks and linear discriminant analysis for the early identification of three categories of students: low, medium and high risk students. Some of the background information (demographics and academic history) of the first-year students in Belgian Frenchspeaking universities were significantly related to academic success. Those were: previous education, number of hours of mathematics, financial independent Early Prediction of Student Success: Mining Students Enrolment Data 650 attendance ence, and age, while gender, parent’s education and occupation, and marital status were not significantly related to the academic success. However, all three methods used to predict academic success did not perform well. Overall the correct classification rate was 40.63% using decision trees, 51.88% using neural networks and the best result\n19 | P a g e\nwas obtained with discriminant analysis with overall classification accuracy of 57.35%. Walters and Soyibo [48], conducted a study to determine Jamaican high school students' (population n=305) level of performance on five integrated science process skills with performance linked to gender, grade level, school location, school type, student type, and socio-economic background (SEB). The results revealed that there was a positive significant relationship between academic performance of the student and the nature of the school.\nWarapon in [49], who presented the use of data mining techniques, particularly classification, to supports high school students in selecting undergraduate programs. Warapon proposed a classification model to give guidelines to students, especially, for the undergraduate programs for making possible better academic plans. The decision tree technique was applied to determine which major is best suitable for students.\nWoodman [50] found for courses in the mathematics and computing faculty at the Open University in UK, by using the binary logistic regression, that the most significant factors to whether students passed, failed or dropped out, were marks for the first assignment, the number of math courses passed in the previous two years, the course level, the points the course is worth and the occupation group of the student. This was the most parsimonious model, but in the model which includes all 25 potential predictors other variables such as ethnicity (ranked as 7th according to its relative importance), education (8th), age group (9th), course level (11th), disability (18th) and gender (22nd) were also significant. However, one of the problems with the logistic regression is that in large samples any difference, may lead to conclusion that the factor is significant when in fact that is not the case. Using the same methodological approach with data available at new student registration in the UK Open University Simpson (2006) found that the most important factor is the course level, followed by credit rating of a course, previous education, course programme, socio-economic status, gender and age. Yadav, Bharadwaj and Pal [51], To predict the students performance they obtained the university students data like attendance, class test, seminar and assignment marks using three algorithms ID3, C4.5 and CART.\n20 | P a g e\nCHAPTER 3"

In this step only those attributes were selected which were needed for data mining. For this, remove missing values; smoothing noisy data, selection of relevant attribute from database or removing irrelevant attributes, identifying or remove outlier values from data set, and resolving inconsistencies of data. Some of the irrelevant parameters was removed from database such as ID, age, date of birth, category, marital status, state of domicile, mother tongue, religion, the gender field containing only one value- female, because university concerns only female students, the marital status field containing one value- unmarried, etc. A categorical variable is constructed based on the numeric parameter percentage in secondary and higher secondary school. A grade scale is used for evaluation of student performance at school. “Garde A” students are considered those who have a percentage greater than 85, “Grade B”- in the range between 75 and 85, “Grade C”- in the range between 65 and 75, and “Grade D” in the range below 65.

In this analysis following F values were used: F-enter value is 3.84 an F-remove value is 2.71 [8].\nTable 13: Variables Entered/Removeda,b,c,d\nStep Entered\nWilks' Lambda\nStatistic df1 df2 df3\nExact F\nStatistic df1 df2 Sig.\n1 Family Stress .492 1 1 218.000 225.503 1 218.000 .000 2 Participation Activity .405 2 1 218.000 159.688 2 217.000 .000 3 Campus environment .356 3 1 218.000 130.295 3 216.000 .000 4 SatisfactionLevel .317 4 1 218.000 116.072 4 215.000 .000 5 Change goal .287 5 1 218.000 106.127 5 214.000 .000 6 Family Type .265 6 1 218.000 98.692 6 213.000 .000 7 residence .247 7 1 218.000 92.251 7 212.000 .000 8 Family Problem .236 8 1 218.000 85.556 8 211.000 .000 9 Home sickness .225 9 1 218.000 80.225 9 210.000 .000 10 Self study .220 10 1 218.000 73.935 10 209.000 .000 11 medium .216 11 1 218.000 68.742 11 208.000 .000 12 TS Relation .211 12 1 218.000 64.423 12 207.000 .000 At each step, the variable that minimizes the overall Wilks' Lambda is entered. a. Maximum number of steps is 66. b. Minimum partial F to enter is 3.84. c. Maximum partial F to remove is 2.71.\nTo determine whether or not there is statistically significant relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variables see Table 14. Number of function is equal to 1 less than numner of levels defined in group variable. In this analysis dependent variable “Dropout Status” has two level 0 (No) and 1 (Yes) therefore only one function is considered. Conclusions about the significance of model were made on the basis of Wilks’ lambda, commonly used in discriminant analysis [40]. The\n41 | P a g e\ndiscriminant function was significant as Wilks’ lambda was .211 (p-value < 0.0001). Its value indicates the existence of differences between groups, that is, the fact that two groups have different means. The model is constructed by with 12 variables that have significant effect upon discrimination between groups [17]. Wilks’ lambda is the portion of total variances in the discriminant score NOT explained by differences among the groups. Table 2 shows 21% of the variance is not explained by group differences. Range of Wilks’ Lambda is 0 to 1. The larger the value, the smaller significance and the smaller the value, the larger the significance is ensured.\nThe canonical correlation coefficient .888 measures the association between the discriminant score and the set of independent variables. Like Wilks’ lambda, it is an indicator of the strength of relationship between entities in the solution.\nWilks’ lambda is used to test null hypothesis that the means of all the independent variables are equal across groups of the dependent variable. If the chi-square statistic corresponding to Wilks’ lambda is statistically significant we conclude that there is a relationship between the dependent groups and the independent variables. Here chisquare is 329.642 and significant at .0001.\nThe eigenvalue assess the relative importance because they reflect the percentage of variance explained in the dependent variable and estimated value is 3.735. Larger the eigenvalue indicate that the discriminant functions is more useful in the distinguishing between groups.\nTable 14: Significance Test of Discriminant Function\nFunction 1 Eigenvalue 3.735 Canonical Correlation .888 Wilks’ Lambda .211 Chi- square 329.642 Df 12 p-value .000\nStandardized discriminant coefficient is used to compare the relative importance of independent variable [17]. Table 15 shows that Family stress is highly correlated to dropout student.\n42 | P a g e\nTable 15: Standardized and Structured coefficient\nVariables Standard coefficient Structure coefficient Residence .336 .100\nfamilyType .311 .193 Medium .198 .102 satisfactionLevel -.327 -.236 familyStress .774 .526\nselfStudy -.174 -.054 participationActivity -.510 -.312\nTSRelation -.168 -.036 familyProblem .238 .130 Homesickness .265 .203 campusEnvironment .329 .242 changeGoal .238 .266\nStructure matrix shows the correlation for each variable with each discriminant function. Based on the structured coefficient value, it can be concluded that academic performance of students in university is mainly determine by Family stress. The student who will not graduate is determined by variables: Residence, Family type, Medium, Satisfaction level, Family stress, Self study, Participation activity, Teacher student relationship, Family Problem, Home sickness, Campus environment, Change goal. In other words, students will dropout, whose residence is urban, family type is joint, education medium is Hindi, who is not satisfied, campus environment is not so good, and who has some stress in family and the student who are not participated in any extra-activity.\nTable 16: Canonical Discriminant Function Coefficient (Unstandardized coefficient)\nVariables Function 1 Residence .808 familyType .661 Medium .432 satisfactionLevel -.539 familyStress 1.058 selfStudy -.179 participationActivity -1.247 TSRelation -.582 familyProblem .547 Homesickness .985 campusEnvironment 1.013 changeGoal 1.055 Constant -.323\n43 | P a g e\nCanonical discriminant function coefficients are used to design a discriminant score function.

The Original classification may be biased because all cases in the analysis are classified by functions created using all cases in the sample. And another is cross validated, uses split halves method, the original dataset is split into two randomly and one half is used to develop the discriminant equation and other half is used to validate it. The classification results indicated in Table 17 reveal that about 99.1% of original grouped cases and 98.6% of cross-validated grouped cases were correctly classified into dropout status (yes and no) groups by the model. The student who will continue their study were classified with slightly better accuracy (99.5%) than the student who will completely decided to drop out at university (94.6%).\n44 | P a g e\nHistogram (Fig. 9) is alternative way of illustrating the distribution of the discriminant function score for each group. Graph shows that there is very minimal overlap between each group. This suggests that the function does discriminate well.\nOverall, out of 33 variables under study only 12 variables such as Residence, Family type, Medium, Satisfaction level, Family stress, Self study, Participation activity, Teacher student relationship, Family Problem, Home sickness, Campus environment and Change of goal were significantly contributed to discrimination between student who will dropout or not.\n45 | P a g e"

On the other hand, the dropout due to personal problem was mainly explained by enrollment for better prospect in other institute (37.84%), home sickness and change of goal (32.43%) followed by adjustment problem (24.32%) respectively (Table 24). However the other factors such as health problem, marriage, peer problem and hectic schedule has not played any role in discontinuing the study programme at residential university , whereas few students had reported likely to dropout due to low placement rate, hectic schedule, course difficulty and learning problem etc. Therefore, only three factors such as\n51 | P a g e\nFamily Problem, Personal Problem and Institutional Problem were considered for analysis purpose after dropping out health factors.

It was found that 53% of the respondents having Institutional problem were also affected by Personal problems. On the other hand only 32 % of Personal problem students were having Institutional problems. It is interesting to note that 50% student dropout was mainly due to both family & institutional factors which also follow the personal factors. Whereas, the joint effect of family and personal factors in relation to institutional factors shows 25% student dropout. Subsequently, the joint contribution of personal and institutional factors in context with family factors explained 36% student’s dropout.\nTable 27: Confidence Analysis\nDropout factor Confidence\nFamily => Personal Support(F,P)/support(F) =12/19 = 0.63 Personal => Family Support(P,F)/support(P) =12/25 = 0.48 Institutional => Personal Support(I,P)/support(I) = 8/15 = 0.53 Personal => Institutional Support(P,I)/support(P) = 8/25 = 0.32 Family, Institutional => Personal Support(F,I,P)/support(F,I) =3/6 =0.5 Family, Personal => Institutional Support(F,P,I)/support(F,P) =3/12 = 0.25 Personal, Institutional => Family Support(P,I,F)/support(P,I) =3/8 = 0.36\nOverall association rule mining technique was applied to find out the relationship between two different factors affecting the student dropout at the university. From the above analysis it can be conclude that the students who have Personal problem (68%) are more prone to dropouts in comparison to Family problem (51%) and Institutional problem (41%).\n55 | P a g e\nCHAPTER 5"

      "heading" : "5.1 Conclusion",
      "text" : "The main purpose of the study was to investigate the major factors causing the dropout of students in undergraduate ICT Courses at Residential University. It has been also assessed the pros cons of the affirmative action provided for the students at the university while analyzing the reaction of respondents about university environment and university infrastructure etc.\nTaking the objectives (para 1.6) into account, an extensive review of the available literature was made. Based on the review of the related literature, basic questions were formulated (see Annex-I) to indicate the nature of assumed relationships among various parameters considered in this study. To verify the stated assumptions, the study had employed different procedures and techniques. In particular, the study was conducted taking 220 samples from first year of BCA and B.Tech students of Computer department at Residential University. Data were collected in pre-scheduled format which was handed over to the student’s alongwith instructions.\nApart from its significance in providing information about the factors for students’ dropout either it is low or high in higher education at residential university level, important measure could be taken to tackle it. The present study provides valuable information to upgrade the university education system.\nIn order to examine the factors that affect the female students’ to dropout the courses during study period and dropout reasons, both quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed. The quantitative method included the students’ questionnaire concerning problems that female students face in higher education, factors that affect female students dropout and causes of attrition, teachers’ and students’ attitude towards affirmative action, the nature and effectiveness of affirmative action given in higher education at the residential university.\nThe findings of student questionnaire were analyzed and interpreted. The computer software called SPSS 20.0 was used for the treatment of the collected data. Statistical techniques such as Frequency distribution for single variable, Cross Tabulation, Chi-\n56 | P a g e\nsquare test, Discriminant analysis and Data mining techniques for application of decision tree (ID3) and association rule have been used to study the causing factors for dropping out the female students.\n Based on the Correlation based feature selection result, it was found that a\nstudent’s dropout was positively correlated with 12 response variables namely residence (rural/urban), family stress, family type, stream in higher secondary, satisfaction level of course, enrolled for other institute, change in goal, infrastructure of university, participation in extra-curricular activity, adjustment problem in hostel, and family problem.  The dropout risk was observed in those students who belong to urban areas,\nhaving some stress, who belong to joint family background, opted bio or arts as a stream in higher secondary, who are not satisfied with course, applied for other institute also, whose goal was to change the stream / institution, who doesn’t like the infrastructure of university and having some negative attitude towards university, who does not participated in any curricular activity, who have adjustment problem in hostel and having some problem in family.  The association rule clearly concludes that the students who have Personal\nproblem were more prone to dropouts in comparison to Family problem and Institutional problem. On the other hand confidence analysis shows that the majority of respondents having family problem suffered due to financial constraints and parent illness. Besides that some of the personal problem such as hostel or campus environment, unsatisfied with teaching environment and poor placement rate were forced the students to discontinue their study.  Result indicates that ID3 decision tree algorithm is best classifier with 98%\naccuracy.\nThe generated information will be quite useful for management of university to develop policies and strategies for better planning and implementation of educational program and infrastructure under measurable condition to increase the enrolment rate in University and to take effective decision to reduce student dropout.\n57 | P a g e"

      "heading" : "5.2 Suggestion",
      "text" : " Though the students’ dropout rate is very low (<20%) which is good indicator\nfor the university, even though the university should give due emphasis to minimize the dropout rate.  The well planned and need based counseling and orientation about how to\ncope up with university academic life, basic life skills and possible problems that may challenge female students, should be given to female students immediately after admission.  Thus, the university authorities have to organize workshops, seminars and\nconferences about the issues equity, affirmative action and multiculturalism to strengthen the already available positive beliefs towards affirmative action. Such type of concept will certainly reduce the student’s dropout rate.  Retention and university success are affected by many factors in which the\ninstitutional environment takes the lions share. Institutional factors include interaction with academic and administrative staff, gender biased institutional roles, traditional academic expectations to girls, etc. Generally, these have to be addressed by interventions like designing a gender policy at national and international level in all universities and institutions.  Lastly, all higher learning institutions / universities should develop a data base\nabout their students, teachers and administrative staff based on their background characteristics. The large dataset on student’s dropout gathered by university / institution will be very much helpful to study the dropout trend at micro and macro level. Such type of study will be useful to increase the enrollment rate in various courses while updating the management system and academic curriculum etc.\n5.3 Future Work\nFuture work is to study on large database of dropout student at the university using other data mining techniques such as Logistic Regression, Clustering and Neural Network in order to determine similarities and relationship between multiple factors.\n58 | P a g e"
