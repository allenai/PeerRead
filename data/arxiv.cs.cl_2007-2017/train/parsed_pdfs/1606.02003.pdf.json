      "text" : "The introduction of external memory has greatly expanded the representational capability of neural network-based model on modeling sequences(Graves et al., 2014), by providing flexible ways of storing and accessing information. More specifically, in neural machine translation, one great improvement came from using an array of vectors to represent the source in a sentence-level memory and dynamically accessing relevant segments of them (alignment) (Bahdanau et al., 2014) through content-based addressing (Graves et al., 2014). The success of RNNsearch demonstrated the advantage of saving the entire sentence of arbitrary length in an unbounded memory for operations of next stage (e.g., decoding).\nIn this paper, we show that an external memory can be used to facilitate the decoding/generation process thorough a memory-enhanced RNN decoder, called MEMDEC. The memory in MEMDEC is a direct extension to the state in the decoding, therefore functionally closer to the memory cell in LSTM(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). It takes the form of a matrix with pre-determined size, each column (“a memory cell”) can be accessed by the decoding RNN with content-based addressing for both reading and writing during the decoding process. This memory is designed to provide a more flexible way to select, represent and synthesize the information of source sentence and previously generated words of target relevant to the decoding. This is in contrast to the set of hidden states of the entire source sentence (which can viewed as another form of memory) in (Bahdanau et al., 2014) for attentive read, but can be combined with it to greatly improve the performance of neural machine translator. We apply our model on English-Chinese translation tasks, achieving performance superior to any published results, SMT or NMT, on the same training data (Xie et al., 2011; Meng et al., 2015; Tu et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2015)\nOur contributions are mainly two-folds\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 00\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nJ un\n2 01\n6\n• we propose a memory-enhanced decoder for neural machine translator which naturally extends the RNN with vector state.\n• our empirical study on Chinese-English translation tasks show the efficacy of the proposed model.\nRoadmap In the remainder of this paper, we will first give a brief introduction to attention-based neural machine translation in Section 2, presented from the view of encoder-decoder, which treats the hidden states of source as an unbounded memory and the attention model as a content-based reading. In Section 3, we will elaborate on the memory-enhanced decoder MEMDEC. In Section 4, we will apply NMT with MEMDEC to a Chinese-English task. Then in Section 5 and 6, we will give related work and conclude the paper."

      "text" : "Our work is built on attention-based NMT(Bahdanau et al., 2014), which represents the source sentence as a sequence of vectors after being processed by RNN or bi-directional RNNs, and then conducts dynamic alignment and generation of the target sentence with another RNN simultaneously.\nAttention-based NMT, with RNNsearch as its most popular representative, generalizes the conventional notion of encoder-decoder in using a unbounded memory for the intermediate representation of source sentence and content-based addressing read in decoding, as illustrated in Figure 1. More specifically, at time step t, RNNsearch first get context vector ct after reading from the source representation MS, which is then used to update the state, and generate the word yt (along with the current hidden state st, and the previously generated word yi−1).\nFormally, given an input sequence x = [x1, x2, . . . , xTx ] and the previously generated sequence y<t = [y1, y2, . . . , yt−1], the probability of next word yt is\np(yt|y<t;x) = f(ct, yt−1, st), (1)\nwhere st is state of decoder RNN at time step t calculated as\nst = g(st−1, yt−1, ct). (2)\nwhere g(·) can be an be any activation function, here we adopt a more sophisticated dynamic operator as in Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU, (Cho et al., 2014)). In the remainder of the paper, we will also use\nGRU to stand for the operator. The reading ct is calculated as\nct = j=Tx∑ j=1 αt,jhj , (3)\nwhere hj is the jth cell in memory MS. More formally, hj = [ ←− hj >, −→ hj >]> is the annotations of xj and contains information about the whole input sequence with a strong focus on the parts surrounding xj , which is computed by a bidirectional RNN. The weight αt,j is computed by\nαt,j = exp(et,j)∑k=Tx\nk=1 exp(et,k) .\nwhere ei,j = vTa tanh(Wast−1 +Uahj) scores how well st−1 and the memory cell hj match. This is called automatic alignment (Bahdanau et al., 2014) or attention model (Luong et al., 2015), but it is essentially reading with content-based addressing defined in (Graves et al., 2014). With this addressing strategy the decoder can attend to the source representation that is most relevant to the stage of decoding."

It is intuitively beneficial to exploit the information of yt−1 when reading from MS, which is missing from the implementation of attention-based NMT in (Bahdanau et al., 2014). In this work, we build a more effective alignment path by feeding both previous hidden state st−1 and the context word yt−1 to the attention model, inspired by the recent implementation of attention-based NMT1. Formally, the calculation of et,j becomes\net,j = v T a tanh(Was̃t−1 +Uahj),\nwhere 1github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial/tree/master/session2\n• s̃t−1 = H(st−1, eyt−1) is an intermediate state tailored for reading from MS with the information of yt−1 (its word embedding being eyt−1) added;\n• H is a nonlinear function, which can be as simple as tanh or as complex as GRU. In our preliminary experiments, we found GRU works slightly better than tanh function, but we chose the latter for simplicity."

      "text" : "In this section we will elaborate on the proposed memory-enhanced decoder MEMDEC. In addition to the source memory MS, MEMDEC is equipped with a buffer memory MB as an extension to the conventional state vector. Figure 3 contrasts MEMDEC with the decoder in RNNsearch (Figure 1) on a high level.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we will refer to the conventional state as vector-state (denoted st) and its memory extension as memory-state (denoted as MBt ). Both states are updated at each time step in a interweaving fashion, while the output symbol yt is predicted based solely on vector-state st (along with ct and yt−1). The diagram of this memory-enhanced decoder is given in Figure 2.\nVector-State Update At time t, the vector-state st is first used to read MB\nrt−1 = readB(st−1,MBt−1) (4)\nwhich then meets the previous prediction yt−1 to form an “intermediate” state-vector\ns̃t = tanh(Wrrt−1 +Wyeyt−1). (5)\nwhere eyt−1 is the word-embedding associated with the previous prediction yt−1. This pre-state s̃t is used to read the source memory MS\nct = readS(s̃t,MS). (6)\nBoth readings in Eq. (4) & (6) follow content-based addressing(Graves et al., 2014) (details later in Section 3.1). After that, rt−1 is combined with output symbol yt−1 and ct to update the new vectorstate\nst = GRU(rt−1,yt−1, ct) (7)\nThe update of vector-state is illustrated in Figure 4.\nMemory-State Update As illustrated in Figure 5, the update for memory-state is simple after the update of vector-state: with the vector-state st+1 the updated memory-state will be\nMBt = write(st,M B t−1) (8)\nThe writing to the memory-state is also content-based, with same forgetting mechanism suggested in (Graves et al., 2014), which we will elaborate with more details later in this section.\nPrediction As illustrated in Figure 6, the prediction model is same as in (Bahdanau et al., 2014), where the score for word y is given by\nscore(y) = DNN([st, ct, eyt−1 ]) >ωy (9)\nwhere ωy is the parameters associated with the word y. The probability of generating word y at time t is then given by a softmax over the scores\np(y|st, ct, yt−1) = exp(score(y))∑ y′ exp(score(y′)) ."

      "text" : "There are two types of operation on writing to memory-state: ERASE and ADD. Erasion is similar to the forget gate in LSTM or GRU, which determines the content to be remove from memory cells. More specifically, the vector µERSt ∈ Rm specifies the values to be removed on each dimension in memory cells, which is than assigned to each cell through normalized weights wWt . Formally, the memory-state after ERASE is given by\nM̃Bt (i) = M B t−1(i)(1−wWt (i) · µERSt ) (13)\ni = 1, · · · , n where\n• µERSt = σ(WERSst) is parametrized with WERS ∈ Rm×m;\n• wWt (i) specifies the weight associated with the ith cell in the same parametric form as in Eq. (10)- (12) with generally different parameters.\nADD operation is similar with the update gate in LSTM or GRU, deciding how much current information should be written to the memory.\nMBt (i) = M̃ B t (i) +w W t (i)µ ADD t\nµADDt = σ(W ADDst)\nwhere µADDt ∈ Rm and WADD ∈ Rm×m. In our experiments, we have a peculiar but interesting observation: it is often beneficial to use the same weights for both reading (i.e., wRt in Section 3.1) and writing (i.e., w W t in Section 3.2 ) for the same vector-state st. We conjecture that this acts like a regularization mechanism to encourage the content of reading and writing to be similar to each other."

(13) at time t can be viewed as an nonlinear way to combine the previous memory-state MBt−1 and the newly updated vector-state st, where the nonlinearity comes from both the content-based addressing and the gating. This is in a way similar to the update of states in regular RNN, while we conjecture that the addressing strategy in MEMDEC makes it easier to selectively change some content updated (e.g., the relatively short-term content) while keeping other content less modified (e.g., the relatively long-term content).\nThe reading operation in Eq. (10) can “extract” the content from MBt relevant to the alignment (reading from MS) and prediction task at time t. This is in contrast with the regular RNN decoder including its gated variants, which takes the entire state vector to for this purpose. As one advantage, although only part of the information in MBt is used at t, the entire memory-state, which may store other information useful for later, will be carry over to time t+ 1 for memory-state update (writing)."

The dimensions of word embedding is 512 and the size of the hidden layer is 1024. The dimemsion of each cell in MB is set to 1024 and the number of cells n is set to 8.\nTraining details We initialize the recurrent weight matrices as random orthogonal matrices. All the bias vectors were initialize to zero. For other parameters, we initialize them by sampling each element from the Gaussian distribution of mean 0 and variance 0.012. Parameter optimization is performed using stochastic gradient descent. Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) is used to automatically adapt the learning rate of each parameter ( = 10−6 and ρ = 0.95). To avoid gradients explosion, the gradients of the cost function which had `2 norm larger than a predefined threshold 1.0 was normalized to the threshold (Pascanu et al., 2013). Each SGD is of a mini-batch of 80 sentences. We train our NMT model with the sentences of length up to 50 words in training data, while for moses system we use the full training data.\n2The corpora include LDC2002E18, LDC2003E07, LDC2003E14, Hansards portion of LDC2004T07, LDC2004T08 and LDC2005T06.\nMemory Initialization Each memory cell is initialized with the source sentence hidden state computed as\nMB(i) = m+ νi (14)\nm = σ(WINI i=Tx∑ i=0 hi)/Tx (15)\nwhere WINI ∈ Rm×2·m; σ is tanh function. m makes a nonlinear transformation of the source sentence information. νi is a random vector sampled from N (0, 0.1).\nDropout we also use dropout for our NMT baseline model and MEMDEC to avoid over-fitting (Hinton et al., 2012). The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. In the simplest case, each unit is omitted with a fixed probability p, namely dropout rate. In our experiments, dropout was applied only on the output layer and the dropout rate is set to 0.5. We also try other strategy such as dropout at word embeddings or RNN hidden states but fail to get further improvements.\nPre-training For MEMDEC, the objective function is a highly non-convex function of the parameters with more complicated landscape than that for decoder without external memory, rendering direct optimization over all the parameters rather difficult. Inspired by the effort on easing the training of very deep architectures (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006), we propose a simple pre-training strategyFirst we train a regular attention-based NMT model without external memory. Then we use the trained NMT model to initialize the parameters of encoder and parameters of MEMDEC, except those related to memory-state (i.e., {WRa,URa,v,wRg ,WERS,WADD}). After that, we fine-tune all the parameters of NMT with MEMDEC decoder, including the parameters initialized with pre-training and those associated with accessing memory-state."

      "text" : "There is a long thread of work aiming to improve the ability of RNN in remembering long sequences, with the long short-term memory RNN (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) being the most salient examples and GRU (Cho et al., 2014) being the most recent one. Those works focus on\ndesigning the dynamics of the RNN through new dynamic operators and appropriate gating, while still keeping vector form RNN states. MEMDEC, on top of the gated RNN, explicitly adds matrixform memory equipped with content-based addressing to the system, hence greatly improving the power of the decoder RNN in representing the information important for the translation task.\nMEMDEC is obviously related to the recent effort on attaching an external memory to neural networks, with two most salient examples being Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and Memory Network (Weston et al., 2014). In fact MEMDEC can be viewed as a special case of NTM, with specifically designed reading (from two different types of memory) and writing mechanism for the translation task. Quite remarkably MEMDEC is among the rare instances of NTM which significantly improves upon state-of-the-arts on a real-world NLP task with large training corpus.\nOur work is also related to the recent work on machine reading (Cheng et al., 2016), in which the machine reader is equipped with a memory tape, enabling the model to directly read all the previous hidden state with an attention mechanism. Different from their work, we use an external bounded memory and make an abstraction of previous information. In (Meng et al., 2015), Meng et. al. also proposed a deep architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning with stacked layers of memory to store the intermediate representations, while our external memory was applied within a sequence."

This memoryenhanced RNN decoder is called MEMDEC. At each time during decoding, MEMDEC will read from this memory and write to this memory once, both with content-based addressing. Unlike the unbounded memory in previous work(Bahdanau et al., 2014) to store the representation of source sentence, the memory in MEMDEC is a matrix with pre-determined size designed to better capture the information important for the decoding process at each time step. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that it can improve by 4.8 BLEU upon Groundhog and 5.3 BLEU upon on Moses, yielding the best performance achieved with the same training set.",
