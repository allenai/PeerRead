      "text" : "Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.

      "text" : "Convolutional neural networks have seen a gradual increase of the number of layers in the last few years, starting from AlexNet [14], VGG [24], Inception [28] to Residual [9] networks, corresponding to improvements in many image recognition tasks. The superiority of deep networks has been spotted in several works in the recent years [3, 20]. However, training deep neural networks has several difficulties, including exploding/vanishing gradients and degradation. Various techniques were suggested to enable training of deeper neural networks, such as well-designed initialization strategies [1, 10], better optimizers [27], skip connections [17, 21], knowledge transfer [4, 22] and layer-wise training [23].\nThe latest residual networks [9] had a large success winning ImageNet and COCO 2015 competition and achieving state-of-the-art in several benchmarks, including object classification on ImageNet and CIFAR, object detection and segmentation on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. Compared to Inception architectures they show better generalization, meaning the features can be utilized in transfer learning with better efficiency. Also, follow-up work showed that residual links speed up convergence of deep networks [29]. Recent follow-up work explored the order of activations in residual networks, presenting identity mappings in residual blocks [11] and improving training of very deep networks. One should also mention highway networks [26] that are concurrent to residual networks, with an essential difference being that the residual link is gated and the weight of this gate is learned.\nc© 2016. The copyright of this document resides with its authors. It may be distributed unchanged freely in print or electronic forms.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n07 14\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\nSo, up to this point, the study of residual networks has focused mainly on the order of activations inside a ResNet block and the depth of residual networks. In this work we attempt to conduct an experimental study that goes beyond the above points. By doing so, our goal is to explore a much richer set of network architectures of ResNet blocks and thoroughly examine how several other different aspects besides the order of activations affect performance. As we explain below, such an exploration of architectures has led to new interesting findings with great practical importance concerning residual networks.\nWidth vs depth in residual networks. The problem of shallow vs deep networks has been in discussion for a long time in machine learning [2, 16] with pointers to the circuit complexity theory literature showing that shallow circuits can require exponentially more components than deeper circuits. The authors of residual networks tried to make them as thin as possible in favor of increasing their depth and having less parameters, and even introduced a «bottleneck» block which makes ResNet blocks even thinner.\nWe note, however, that the residual block with identity mapping that allows to train very deep networks is at the same time a weakness of residual networks. As gradient flows through the network there is nothing to force it to go through residual block weights and it can avoid learning anything during training, so it is possible that there is either only a few blocks that learn useful representations, or many blocks share very little information with small contribution to the final goal. This problem was formulated as diminishing feature reuse in [26]. The authors of [12] tried to address this problem with the idea of randomly disabling residual blocks during training. This method can be viewed as a special case of dropout [25], where each residual block has an identity scalar weight on which dropout is applied. The effectiveness of this approach proves the hypothesis above.\nMotivated by the above observation, our work builds on top of [11] and tries to answer the question of how wide deep residual networks should be and address the problem of training. In this context, we show that the widening of ResNet blocks (if done properly) provides a much more effective way of improving performance of residual networks compared to increasing their depth. In particular, we present wider deep residual networks that significantly improve over [11], having 50 times less layers and being more than 2 times faster. We call the resulting network architectures wide residual networks. For instance, our wide 16-layer deep network has the same accuracy as a 1000-layer thin deep network and a comparable number of parameters, although being several times faster to train. This type of experiments thus seem to indicate that the main power of deep residual networks is in residual blocks, and that the effect of depth is supplementary. We note that one can train even better wide residual networks that have twice as many parameters (and more), which suggests that to further\nimprove performance by increasing depth of thin networks one needs to add thousands of layers in this case.\nUse of dropout in ResNet blocks. Dropout was first introduced in [25] and then was adopted by many successful architectures as [14, 24] etc. It was mostly applied on top layers that had a large number of parameters to prevent feature coadaptation and overfitting. It was then mainly substituted by batch normalization [13] which was introduced as a technique to reduce internal covariate shift in neural network activations by normalizing them to have specific distribution. It also works as a regularizer and the authors experimentally showed that a network with batch normalization achieves better accuracy than a network with dropout. In our case, as widening of residual blocks results in an increase of the number of parameters, we studied the effect of dropout to regularize training and prevent overfitting. Previously, dropout in residual networks was studied in [11] with dropout being inserted in the identity part of the block, and the authors showed negative effects of that. Instead, we argue here that dropout should be inserted between convolutional layers. Experimental results on wide residual networks show that this leads to consistent gains, yielding even new state-of-theart results (e.g., 16-layer-deep wide residual network with dropout achieves 1.64% error on SVHN).\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are as follows:\n• We present a detailed experimental study of residual network architectures that thoroughly examines several important aspects of ResNet block structure.\n• We propose a novel widened architecture for ResNet blocks that allows for residual networks with significantly improved performance.\n• We propose a new way of utilizing dropout within deep residual networks so as to properly regularize them and prevent overfitting during training.\n• Last, we show that our proposed ResNet architectures achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets dramatically improving accuracy and speed of residual networks."

Furthermore, so-called «bottleneck» blocks were initially used to make blocks less computationally expensive to increase the number of layers. As we want to study the effect of widening and «bottleneck» is used to make networks thinner we don’t consider it too, focusing instead on «basic» residual architecture.\nThere are essentially three simple ways to increase representational power of residual blocks:\n• to add more convolutional layers per block • to widen the convolutional layers by adding more feature planes • to increase filter sizes in convolutional layers\nAs small filters were shown to be very effective in several works including [24, 29] we do not consider using filters larger than 3×3. Let us also introduce two factors, deepening factor l and widening factor k, where l is the number of convolutions in a block and k multiplies the number of features in convolutional layers, thus the baseline «basic» block corresponds to l = 2, k = 1. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) show schematic examples of «basic» and «basic-wide» blocks respectively.\nThe general structure of our residual networks is illustrated in table 1: it consists of an initial convolutional layer conv1 that is followed by 3 groups (each of size N) of residual blocks conv2, conv3 and conv4, followed by average pooling and final classification layer. The size of conv1 is fixed in all of our experiments, while the introduced widening factor k scales the width of the residual blocks in the three groups conv2-4 (e.g., the original «basic» architecture is equivalent to k = 1). We want to study the effect of representational power of residual block and, to that end, we perform and test several modifications to the «basic» architecture, which are detailed in the following subsections."

Note that, as we do not consider «bottleneck» blocks as explained earlier, the number of feature planes is always\nkept the same across the block. We would like to answer the question of how important each of the 3× 3 convolutional layers of the «basic» residual architecture is and if they can be substituted by a less computationally expensive 1× 1 layer or even a combination of 1× 1 and 3× 3 convolutional layers, e.g., B(1,3) or B(1,3). This can increase or decrease the representational power of the block.

The comparison has to be done among networks with the same number of parameters, so in this case we need to build networks with different l and d (where d denotes the total number of blocks) while ensuring that network complexity is kept roughly constant.

While the number of parameters increases linearly with l (the deepening factor) and d (the number of ResNet blocks), number of parameters and computational complexity are quadratic in k. However, it is more computationally effective to widen the layers than have thousands of small kernels as GPU is much more efficient in parallel computations on large tensors, so we are interested in an optimal d to k ratio.\nOne argument for wider residual networks would be that almost all architectures before residual networks, including the most successful Inception [28] and VGG [24], were much wider compared to [11]. For example, residual networks WRN-22-8 and WRN-16-10 (see next paragraph for explanation of this notation) are very similar in width, depth and number of parameters to VGG architectures.\nWe further refer to original residual networks with k = 1 as «thin» and to networks with k > 1 as «wide». In the rest of the paper we use the following notation: WRN-n-k denotes a residual network that has a total number of convolutional layers n and a widening factor k (for example, network with 40 layers and k = 2 times wider than original would be denoted as WRN-40-2).

CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets [15] consist of 32×32 color images drawn from 10 and 100 classes split into 50,000 train and 10,000 test images. For image preprocessing we follow the methodology of [11] and [7], performing global contrast normalization and ZCA whitening.

The results are presented in table 4. As can be seen, all networks with 40, 22 and 16 layers see consistent gains when width is increased by 1 to 12 times. On the other hand, when keeping the same fixed widening factor k = 8 or k = 10 and varying depth from 16 to 28 there is a consistent improvement, however when we further increase depth to 40 accuracy decreases (e.g., WRN-40-8 loses in accuracy to WRN-22-8).\nWe show additional results in table 5 where we compare thin and wide residual networks. As can be observed, wide WRN-40-4 can be compared to thin ResNet-1001 as they achieve approximately the same accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. It is interesting that they have comparable number of parameters, 8.9×106 and 10.2×106, suggesting that depth does not add regularization effects compared to width at this level. As we show further in benchmarks, WRN-40-4 is 8 times faster to train, so evidently depth to width ratio in the original thin residual networks is far from optimal.\nAlso, wide WRN-28-10 outperforms thin ResNet-1001 by 0.8% (with the same minibatch size during training) on CIFAR-10 and 2.2% on CIFAR-100, having 36 times less layers (see table 5). We note that the result of 4.64% with ResNet-1001 was obtained with batch size 64, whereas we use a batch size 128 in all of our experiments (i.e., all other results reported in table 5 are with batch size 128). Training curves for these networks are presented in Figure 2.\nDespite previous arguments that depth gives regularization effects and width causes network to overfit, we successfully train networks with 5 times more parameters than ResNet1001. Wide WRN-28-12 (table 4) has 52.5×106 parameters and outperforms ResNet-1001 (table 5) by a significant margin.\nTo summarize:\n• widening consistently improves performance across residual networks of different depth;\n• increasing both depth and width helps until the number of parameters becomes too high and stronger regularization is needed;\n• there doesn’t seem to be a regularization effect from very high depth in residual networks as wide networks with the same number of parameters as thin ones can learn same or better representations. Furthermore, wide networks can successfully learn with a 2 or more times larger number of parameters than thin ones, which would require doubling the depth of thin networks, making them infeasibly expensive to train.\n0 50 100 150 200\n100\n101 102 tr a in in g l o ss\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\nte st\ne rr\no r\n(% )\nte st\ne rr\no r\n(% )\nCIFAR-10\nResNet-164(error 5.46%) WRN-28-10(error 4.17%)\n0 50 100 150 200\n101\n102\ntr a in\nin g l o ss\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nte st\ne rr\no r\n(% )\nte st\ne rr\no r\n(% )\nCIFAR-100\nResNet-164(error 24.33%) WRN-28-10(error 20.50%)\nFigure 2: Training curves for thin and wide residual networks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

We used cross-validation to determine dropout probability values, 0.3 on CIFAR and 0.4 on SVHN. Also, we didn’t have to increase number of training epochs compared to baseline networks without dropout.\nOn CIFAR-10 there is almost no significant improvement, and on CIFAR-100 dropout successfully reduces error by 0.5% using wide WRN-28-10 and by 1.65% using thin ResNet50. To our knowledge, that’s the first result to approach 20% error on CIFAR-100, even outperforming methods with heavy data augmentation. There is a noticeable drop in accuracy with WRN-16-4 on CIFAR which we speculate is due to the relatively small number of parameters and dataset (table 6).\nWe notice a disturbing effect in residual network training after the first learning rate drop when both loss and validation error suddenly start to go up and oscillate on high values until the next learning rate drop. It might be related to momentum in batch normalization calculation, however we didn’t investigate that further. Dropout partially removes this effect in most cases, see figures 2, 3.\nThe effect of dropout becomes more evident on SVHN. This is probably due to the fact that we don’t do any data augmentation and batch normalization overfits, so dropout adds a regularization effect. Evidence for this can be found on training curves in figure 3 where the loss without dropout drops to very low values. The results are presented in table 6. We observe significant improvements from using dropout on both thin and wide networks. Thin 50-layer deep network even outperforms thin 152-layer deep network with stochastic depth [12]. Due to lack of time we only trained 16-layer deep network with k = 4 and our results very likely can be further improved with wider/deeper networks, still this network achieves 1.64% on SVHN which is the best published result to our knowledge. The improvement from 2.07% to 1.85% test error on SVHN confirms that widening is effective across large and small datasets.\nOverall, despite the arguments of combining with batch normalization, dropout shows itself as an effective techique of regularization of thin and wide networks. It can be used to further improve results from widening, while also being complementary to it.\ndepth k dropout CIFAR-10 CIFAR-100 SVHN"

    "abstractText" : "Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems, in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.
