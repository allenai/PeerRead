      "text" : "The significant progress of portable devices and wearable devices with multi-functional sensors has enabled us to easily record all the sensing data and to record all the observed events and phenomena. This situation motivates us to analyze such recorded data, and many studies have explored a wide range of methods of pattern recognition, biological data analysis, speech recognition, image classification, behavior recognition, and time-series data analysis. Esmaeili et al. categorized three types of sequential patterns after theoretical investigation for a large amount of data [1]. Lewis et al. proposed a sequential algorithm using queries to train text classifiers [2]. Song et al. proposed a sequential clustering algorithm for gene data [3]. More recently, studies using sensor data analysis for human behavior recognition and video sequence understanding have received significant attention because of the significant progress on wearable devices and the widespread of video surveillance systems [4, 5, 6]. Those devices enable users to record all of their experiences such as what is viewed, what is heard, and what is noticed. Nevertheless, although collecting all observed data\n∗H.

In case of life log data application, for example, it must be much easy to exactly retrieve information of particular places or dates if rich and comprehensive meta-data are sufficiently attached to every piece of datum to be identified. However, if a query is very ambiguous like retrieving a situation similar to the current situation where 10- minute continuous “Event A” starts 30 minutes later after half-hourly “Event B” finishes, it must be surely challenging to obtain meaningful results at the end. Thus, finding such similar sequential patterns from vast sequential data using a given target pattern extracted from the current situation is of crucial importance. This is of interest in the present paper. Finding similar sequential patterns needs to discriminate particular sequential patterns from many partial groups of multiple events of patterns. For this purpose, among the specialized methods to detect similar partial patterns from sequential data, which include, for instance, Dynamic Programming (DP) matching algorithm, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), this paper dedicates solely to hidden Markov model (HMM) because HMM is specialized and promising to deal with sequential data by exploiting transition probability between states, i.e., events.\nThe primary contributions of our work are two-fold: (a) we advocate that the support of both “state duration” and “state interval” is of great significance to represent practical sequential data based on the studies about the feature and structure of sequential data, then we extract requirements for its modeling. Next, (b) we propose two new sequential models by extending hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) [7] to support both state duration and interval of events efficiently. More concretely, regarding (a), we especially address the generalization of model requirements for sequential data, and emphasize the importance of handling events order, continuous time length, i.e., state duration of an event, and discontinuous time length, i.e., state interval between two events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generalization of the model requirements for sequential data. Herein, we define the continuous duration time of a state as state duration, and define the discontinuous interval with no observation as state interval, respectively because an event is treated as a state in HMM. Then, with respect to (b), after assessment of the extended HMM models in the literature against those requirements, we show that all the existing models do not treat both state duration and state interval simultaneously. Nevertheless, we also show that HSMM, one of the extended HMM models, handles state duration, and is an appropriate baseline to be extended to meet all the demands. Subsequently, in the present paper, we propose two extended models by extending HSMM that accommodates not only state duration but also state interval.\nTwo approaches are specifically addressed to treat state interval with HSMM. For both approaches, three variations can be considered to model state interval; modeling state interval with (i) only preceding state, (ii) only subsequent state, and (iii) both preceding and subsequent states. From the viewpoint of modeling accuracy, we specifically examine the modeling of state interval with both preceding and subsequent states. Then, we finally propose two extended models of HSMM: one represents state interval as a new node of state interval, and the other represents state interval by a new probability of state interval length. The first model, dubbed interval state hidden semiMarkov model (IS-HSMM), is categorized into a straightforward extension of the original HSMM. The distinct difference is the introduction of a new “interval state node.” A simple introduction of the interval state node into HSMM, however, leads to improper transition probabilities because the transition frequencies from ordinal state to the new interval state and the transition from the interval state to another state may increase when the symbols of interval state are observed frequently. This causes undesired biases onto the original transition probability, and finally brings severe degradation of model accuracy. To solve this issue, IS-HSMM expresses two-dimensional Markov model at the part where the preceding state is the interval state node. Meanwhile, the second proposed model is called as interval length probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which represents\nstate interval by a new parameter to HSMM. This parameter is “interval length probability” which is represented as a probability density distribution function, and is modeled with the two combined states. Preliminary studies of ILP-HSMM was proposed in our earlier work as DI-HMM [8].\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces related work. Section 3 presents a description of the model requirements and the requirement assessment of the existing HMM variants. Then, a brief explanation of the original HMM model is given. Section 4 explains the baseline model of our proposal: hidden semi-Markov model, i.e., HSMM. After examining the approaches for state interval modeling based on HSMM in Section 5, we propose two models, IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM, in Section 6 and Section 7, respectively. Finally, we show superior performances of the proposed models in comparison with HSMM in Section 8. We summarize the results presented in this paper and describe future work in Section 9."

      "text" : "This section presents related work for sequential data analysis. For sequential pattern matching and sequential pattern detection, the Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm [9] provides an optimized search algorithm that calculates the cost of a path in a grid and which thereby finds the least costly path. This was first used for acoustic speech recognition. For sequential pattern classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) [10, 11] is a classifier that converts the n-class problem into multiple two-class problems. SVM has proved its superior performances in a wide range of applications such as face and object recognitions from a picture. As for Regression Model (RM)[12], the logistic regression model [13] is a representative model that is powerful binary classification model when the model parameters are independent each other. Hidden Markov model (HMM), originally proposed in [14, 15], is a statistical tool used for modeling generative sequences. HMM has been frequently used together with the Viterbi algorithm to estimate the likelihood of generating observation sequences. Whereas HMM is widely used for many applications, for example, speech recognition, handwriting recognition and activity recognition, many extended HMMs have been also proposed to enhance the expressive capabilities of the baseline HMM model as well as to support various specialized application data. Thus, addressing HMM is a powerful and robust model for treating sequential data using its transition probability in a statistical manner, we particularly examine HMM in the present paper.\nWith regard to the extensions of HMM, Xue et al. proposed transition-emitting HMMs (TEHMMs) and state-emitting HMMs (SE-HMMs) to treat the discontinuous symbol [16], of which application is an off-line handwriting word recognition. The observation data contain discontinuous and continuous symbols between characters when writing in cursive letters. They specifically examined such discontinuous features and continuous features, and extended HMM to treat both of them. Bengio et al. focused on mapping input sequences to the output sequences [17]. The proposed model supports a recurrent networks processing style and describes an extended architecture under the supervised learning paradigm. Salzenstein et al. dealt with a statistical model based on Fuzzy Markov random chains for image segmentations in the context of stationary and non-stationary data [18]. They specifically examined the observation in a non-stationary context, and proposed a model and a method to estimate model parameters. Yu et al. proposed the explicit-duration hidden Markov model [19, 20, 21, 22]. They emphasized the interval between state transition, and proposed a new forward-backward algorithm to estimate the model parameters.\nAddressing the difference of duration in each state, hidden semi-Markov Model (HSMM) is proposed to treat the duration and multiple observations produced in one single state [7, 23]. HSMM has been applied for some application data like time-series data. Bulla proposed an estimation\nprocedure to the right-censored HSMM for modeling financial time-series data using conditional Gaussian distributions for the HSMM parameters [24]. For diagnosis and prognosis using multisensor equipment, Dong et al. prioritized the weights for each sensor to treat multiple sensor results, and showed that the proposed model of HSMM gave higher performances than the original HSMM [25]. Recently, Dasu analyzed the technique of HSMM, and described how to implement HSMM for a practical application in detail [26]."

      "text" : "This section presents discussions on the requirements for model description using time-series data: representative data of sequential data. For this purpose, we assume the situation where multiple different sequences are independently generated from five sensors as shown in Figure 1. Here, an observed event of which value exceeds a predefined threshold is recognized as a ‘state’ represented in a block. The continuous period of each event is represented by the length of the block. Since events are not successively observed, namely, no-observation period, exists between two successive states in certain periods, the length of such no observation period is represented as the distance\nbetween two blocks. In this example, we also assume that a set of four black-colored blocks, {S1, S2, S3, S4}, express an extracted multiple states that forms one particular group.\nNow we extract the requirements for model description. First, addressing this formation of four blocks, we see that these states are surely observed in a prescribed order. Thus, we find that the order of multiple states should be described in a model (R1). Second, multiple states can be observed in a partially overlapped manner as seen in S1 and S2. In other words, multiple states can occur simultaneously at a certain period. Therefore, the model needs to support the representation capability to describe multiple states occurring at the same time (R2). Third, since the time lengths of respective states mutually differ, the duration of a state needs to be expressed in a model (R3). Finally, for the case in which each state occurs intermittently, a vacant period between one state and another state that is not involved in the group of sequence might exist between two states. Furthermore, the length of this vacant period shall be variable. Therefore, state interval between two states in a model must be described (R4). In summary, the sequential data model is required to describe these requirements, and this paper defines these respective requirements as follows;\n(i) R1: State order\n(ii) R2: Staying multiple states in a certain period\n(iii) R3: State duration\n(iv) R4: State interval\nAmong these items, R2 differs from other items because R1, R3, and R4 are required even for a single sequence while R2 is the requirement for multiple sequences. Therefore, this study specifically examines requirements R1, R3, and R4. The examination of R2 shall be left for advanced researches to be undertaken in future work."

      "text" : "This section investigates whether HMM and the extended variants of HMM satisfy those requirements. Table 1 summarizes a comparison among the existing HMM models from the viewpoints of the model requirements described above. Since the baseline HMM model describes the order of the states (R1), all the extended HMM models inherit this capability. FO-HMM is specialized for treating the ambiguity of observation symbols, and does not contribute to our model requirement. IO-HMM is a hybrid model of generative and discriminative models to treat the estimation probability commonly used for input sequence and observations. Therefore, it does not satisfy the\nremaining requirements. HSMM models the time length to remain in one single state [7], and its variants including HMM-selftrans and EDM [19, 20, 21, 22] satisfy the same requirements: state order (R1) and state duration (R3).\nAs a result of investigation of the requirement satisfaction, we find that no existing HMM model accommodates both state duration and state interval together. Nevertheless, we conclude that HSMM is the best baseline model to be extended towards our new target model because only HSMM handles state duration. Hence, the next section gives a detailed explanation of HSMM."

      "text" : "HMM has been studied as a powerful model for speech recognition because the important parts for modeling are the features of each phoneme and the order of phonemics [28, 29, 21]. The model parameters of HMM consists of the initial state probability, the transition probability between states and the emission probability of observation elements from each state. Whereas the model training phase calculates the optimum values of the model parameters, the recognition phase calculates the probabilities for each model that generates a observed sequence when the sequence is observed from each model using the trained model parameters, and finally selects the most appropriate model as a recognition result.\nAmong the model parameters, the distinguishing feature of HMM is to model the transition probability of every pair of two states. However, the time length to stay in each state is also essential for modeling in some useful applications like online handwriting recognition. For this purpose, HSMM has been proposed to support this time length, and has long been studied for some specific applications such as speech recognition and online handwriting recognition. This section, after providing basic notations, details the algorithms of the model training and recognition in HSMM."

      "text" : "The HSMM structure is shown in Figure 2 comparing with that of HMM. Hereafter, we assume that each unit time at time t has one corresponding observation ot. The observation sequence from time t = t1 to t = t2 is denoted as ot1:t2 = ot1 , ..., ot2 . A set of output symbols that are actually observed is expressed as Y = {y1, y2, · · · , yN}, where N is the number of observations. Therefore, ot can be expressed as ot = yn, where yn ∈ Y . A set of hidden states is S = {1, · · ·,M}, where M is the number of states’ kinds, and the hidden state sequence from time t = 1 to t = T is expressed S1:T = S1, ..., ST , where St represents a state at time t. While HMM allows each state node to emit an observation symbol, HSMM allows each super state node to emit multiple observation symbols, i.e, observation sequence. Here the hidden state sequence is represented as Q = q1, · · · , qk, · · · , qK where K is the number of state in a sequence. While K = T in HMM, K ≤ T in HSMM. Then, the k-th hidden state is assigned a state i as qk = i(i ∈ S) in both HMM and HSMM as well. The parameters incorporated in the HMM model are Λ = {A,B,π}, where A ∈ RM×M is the matrix representing the transition probabilities between states, B ∈ RM×N is the matrix for the emission probability from each state, and π ∈ RM represents the initial probability values that occur each state. In general, the transition probability from state i to state j is denoted as A(i, j) = aij where i, j ∈ S. Similarly, the emission probability of symbol yn from state j is represented as bj(yn) and B(j, n) = bj(yn) = bj(ot) where j ∈ S and yn ∈ Y . The initial probability of occurring each state is denoted as πi ∈ π.\nOn the other hand, HSMM handles the same set of parameters Λ = {A,B,π}, but the elements of each parameter differ from those of HMM to describe the duration of states. The set of duration\ntime is denoted as D and the duration of state i is represented as di ∈ D. Considering this new parameter, the transition probability from state i to state j is represented as a(i,di)(j,dj) in stead of ai,j , and the emission probability is represented as bj,dj (ot+1:t+dj ) in stead of bj(ot). The parameters Λ is updated by the recursive calculation for inference and the latest calculation result for update is represented as Λ̂. The overall algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1."

The forward-backward algorithm is an inference algorithm used for HMM, and the an extended algorithm special for HSMM is also proposed[30].\nThe concrete calculation algorithm for HSMM is detailed as follows: computing forward probabilities starts from t = 1 to t = T , and computing backward probabilities from t = T to t = 1.

However, we also take into consideration this period i.e., no-observation period, because this is alsoessential to model sequential data as described in Section 3.1.

On the other hand, the other approach represents state interval as an new probabilistic parameter as shown in Figure 4 (b).\nFor both approaches, three variations to model state interval can be considered. The first approach models state interval with the preceding state ((a)-1, (b)-1), and the second models it with the subsequent state ((a)-2, (b)-2).

The structure of the first approach is illustrated in Figure 5, where the interval state node is represented as a black node iS. Although this approach handles state interval in a simple way, it causes big bias in the transition probability when there are many groups of terms observed interval symbols in a sequence as shown in Figure 6. Details of the problem are examined using an example presented in the same figure. Figure 6 (a) shows\nan example sequence for the explanation. Each sequence shows the original observation sequence and the state sequence. On the other hand, Figure 6 (b) shows an example sequence filled with state interval nodes of interval symbol i. The tables represented at the right of the figure show the transition frequency from a state to another state calculated using the original/complemented sequence. While the states described in a vertical line in the table show the “from” states, the states in a horizontal line show the “to” state. The table in (a) shows the transition frequency calculated using the original state sequence, and the table in (b) shows the transition frequency calculated using the converted state sequence filled with interval states. Accordingly, the results reveal that the transition frequency in the while cells except for gray painted cells falls dramatically to lower level, i.e., nealy zero. This means that, the introduction of the interval state node causes a deviation to the original transition probability, and the resultant new model fails to represent the transition sequence properly.\nOn the other hand, for the second approach in the preceding subsection, the manner of representing state interval with the new probabilistic parameter “interval length probability” must be defined. Considering application data, the model is expected to be found such that sequential data have a similar sequential pattern with similar state duration and state interval. Hence, it is required to model state duration and state interval with representing the similarity of its time length. Therefore, the second approach defines how to represent the new parameter for state duration and how to model the parameters with original HSMM in a probabilistic way.\nAddressing these problems, we finally propose two extended models in the following sections; interval state hidden semi-Markov model (IS-HSMM) as the first approach, and interval length probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) for the second approach."

It should be noted that the interval length probability corresponds to the probability density distribution of interval length of two states, to be technically precise. The distinct difference between HSMM and ILP-HSMM is that, whereas state j starts just after the end time of state i in the original HSMM, state j starts after a length of time, Li,j , passes since the end time of state i in ILP-HSMM. The conceptual model structure of ILP-HSMM is illustrated in Figure 8. Although the structure of ILP-HSMM is similar to that of HSMM illustrated in Figure 2, the interval length probability is newly added to HSMM as shown in Figure 8, where Li,j represents the time difference between the end time of state i and the beginning time of state j. Here, note that the total time length of the observation sequence T varies because of its dependency on the length of state duration and interval, leading to T = ΣKk=1(dk + lk−1,k), where lk−1,k is the time difference between the end of qk−1 and the beginning of qk.

      "text" : "Figure 9 shows an example data and representations used for explanation hereinafter. The slash line patterned blocks represent the data sequence of training dataset. First, the probability density distribution of the interval length of Li,j is expressed by the Gaussian distribution p(Li,j) as\np(Li,j) = 1√ 2πσ2 e−\n(Li,j−µ) 2\n2σ2 , (10)\nwhere σ and µ represent the variance and the mean of Li,j , respectively. It should be noted that the Gaussian distribution is adopted as the probability density distribution for simplicity. However, other distributions and functions could be adopted for ILP-HSMM without changing any other parameters. Accordingly, the set of parameters used in ILP-HSMM is defined as\nΛ := {A,B,π,L},\nwhere the elements of the parameter Λ take on A(i, j) = a(i,di)(j,dj), B(j, n) = b(j,dj)(o1:dj ), and π(i) = πj,dj , where di ∈ D represents the duration of state i described in Section 4.1. Furthermore, L ∈ RM×M is the matrix that consists of the interval length probabilities, i.e., the probability density distributions of state interval length, where L(i, j) = p(Li,j). The transition and emission probabilities are defined as the same as those in HSMM. The difference between HSMM and ILPHSMM is to consider the parameter of p(Li,j).\nThe range of Li,j in (10) might influence either memory consumption and/or computational complexity to generate the model. There might be no Li,j value suitable for the observation values because of the range limitation of Li,j if p(Li,j) is generated in a training period. However, if the parameter p(Li,j) is generated every time an observation is fed to the algorithm, the calculation cost can be much higher. Our motivation to introduce the interval length probability to HSMM is,\nas explained earlier, to find the similar part of sequential data with respect to state interval and also to discriminate between the target part and the similar part. Therefore, even if the probability of Li,j is presumed to be zero around the skirts of the distribution, no critical problem arises. Consequently, we introduce the boundary of the probability value δpt to determine the edge of the skirt of p(Li,j). On generating the p(Li,j), the calculation is terminated when the probability value becomes less than δpt. The probability of p(Li,j) is zero outside of the range of δpt."

The pair of the model with the interval length probability and its label expected to be estimated are stored as the candidates for estimation. The recognition label that indicates the estimated result is selected when the model has the maximum likelihood estimate by calculating it for each state in each model.\nFirst, we calculate p(Li,j) beforehand. If Li,j is out of the range, the probability density distribution is determined as\np(Li,j) = min i,j∈S\np(Li,j)× c,\nwhere c is 0 ≤ c ≤ 1.

The interval length probability in ILP-HSMM could be integrated by introducing each interval into two pair of states to calculate the likelihood. This calculation might cause additional calculation cost. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the calculation cost. In addition, the emission probability bj,dj (o1:dj ) can be parametric or nonparametric. In this proposal, the relation of state duration and state interval is not represented\nin a model. For this reason, bj,dj (o1:dj ) is handled as non-parametric, discrete, and independent of the duration. Then, p(Li,j) is also discrete and independent of the duration and the transition probability."

When the same music is played by the different instruments, even if the music rhythm is the same, the length of each sound for the same note differs. For example, the sound power spectrum played by organ and drum for the same music sound data is shown in Figure 10. The horizontal axis represents time, and the vertical axis represents the sound power, i.e., sound volume. While the power of each note played by the organ is almost the same during the sound resonating, the one played by the drum decreases rapidly after tapping. We generate the observation sequence from the music sound data. The generation step is described below using the features of sound continuous time. Step 1\nSet the threshold b1 and b2 to classify the observation symbols into three types by the level of the volume. b1 is a threshold for determining whether the sound “on” or “off”, and b2 is the one for classifying the power of the sound into “high” and “low”. (b2 ≥ b1) Step 2\nFor the sound power v of each time, the observation sequence is generated as follows. If v ≥ b2, then the observation symbol is “high”.\nIf b2 > v ≥ b1, then the observation symbol is “low”. An example of observation sequence generated by the procedure described above is shown in Figure 11. The black cell represents the “high” symbol; the gray cell represents a “low” symbol, and the cells of the white-painted represents the “interval.” To indicate the segment of a sequence, we add “start” and “end” symbols to each edge of the sequence. These symbols are useful for modeling the transition from the initial state from sequences precisely. The dataset consists of 27 segmented data, which are divided into bars of the music sequence, and each bar is assigned a label. A label is assigned for each 27 segmented data, therefore the number of labels is also 27. The kinds of the instruments are a grand piano, horn, drums, acoustic guitar, flute, and pipe organ. We use the music sound data played by the instrument of first three kinds for the training data, while the latter three kinds are used for the recognition data.

The evaluation metric is the recognition accuracy based on f-measure that is calculated using (2 · recall · precision)/(recall + precision), where precision = TP/PP , and recall = TP/AP . Here, when the Predicted Positive (PP ) is the number of models with likelihood calculated using (6) is maximum in all models, True Positive (TP ) is the number of collected models in PP , and Actually Positive (AP ) is the number of labeled models.\nResults are presented in Figure 14 and Figure 15. The x-axis represents Precision, Recall, and f-measure, and the y-axis represents the score. The left, middle and right bars represent the results of HSMM, IS-HSMM, and ILP-HSMM, respetively. Figure 14 shows the results obtained when the number of states is 5, and Figure 15 presents the results obtained when the number of states is 10. Both results are the average scores of five repetitions. The results showed that both the proposed models IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM have higher recognition performance than HSMM. By comparing the results of IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM, the scores of f-measure are similar, but the scores of recall and precision differ. IS-HSMM has a higher score for recall, but it has lower score for precision than ILP-HSMM. In the next section, we analyze the performance of IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM in detail. Finally, comparison of the two results obtained when the numbers of states are 5 and 10 shows that the recognition performance can be higher depending on the number of states increasing.\nThe earlier experiment includes observation symbols of only three kinds. To evaluate the performance of treating various durations and intervals with observation symbols of many kinds, we use the musical scale instead of the volume of the sound as observation symbols. Figure 16 shows the musical scale with stairs of example data. These are the some input data extracted from the\nevaluation data. The number on the each graph signifies the label. Each value from 0.01 to 0.12 in 0.01 intervals is assigned to C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B of the musical scale. If the volume is lower than a threshold, then the value of sound scale label is zero. It means the interval observation in a sequence. The results of recognition performance using the data generated as described above are shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18. They show results of recognition performance evaluation when the numbers of states are 2 and 10. The scores are the average scores of five repetitions. Considering that it would be high performance when the number of states is greater than the number of observation symbols in HSMM, we assign 2 and 10 as the number of states in the experience to compare the performance of them.\nWhen the number of states is 2, the recognition performance of HSMM is extremely low, but those of IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM are much higher than HSMM. In addition to this, the results of IS-HSMM are much higher than ILP-HSMM. However, when the number of states is 10, the number of states is greater than the number of the observation symbols. At this time, the entire scores of HSMM, IS-HSMM, and ILP-HSMM are higher than 0.4. For the HSMM, the recall score gives the max score in all models but the precision score indicates the lowest value. Therefore, the probability for each sequence using HSMM is similar to that of each other sequence. Then, while the average scores of precision, recall, and f-measure are more than 0.8 in IS-HSMM, the average score is about 0.7 in ILP-HSMM. As a result, when the number of states increases, the scores of IS-HSMM are higher than those of ILP-HSMM because increasing the states contributes to treatment of the transition probability from a state to another state. Therefore, IS-HSMM is effective for treating the order of the sequence precisely because the “interval” is represented with one of states and HMM can model the transition probability between two states.\nHowever, regarding the input data shown in Figure 16 in detail, No. 4 input data are similar to No. 7; the No. 2 input data are similar to No. 10. It is difficult to distinguish the small time\ndifference between two sequences with both IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM even if the number of states increases. It might cause the decline of recognition performance.\nMoreover, ILP-HSMM treats the state interval using the new additional parameter between two stationary states. If state interval is mostly similar between static two states, ILP-HSMM can model the length of interval precisely, but it is difficult to model a sequence including various length of duration and interval. Therefore, to treat the sequential data of various kinds with duration and interval, IS-HSMM would lead to higher performance than ILP-HSMM. The following section shows the evaluation results of modeling performance and analysis between ILP-HSMM and IS-HSMM."

We calculate the performance of reproducibility and compare both IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM. The percentage modeling performance indicates how precisely the model generates the original sequence, which is represented as r. The modeling performance r is calculated as\nr =\n∑T t=1(wt = ot)\nT ,\nwhere o1:T is the original sequence, T is the time length of the original sequence, and w1:T is the generated sequence using the model parameter θ which is calculated using the original sequence. To calculate the equation presented above, we give the sequence length T and generate a sequence which has high likelihood using the forward algorithm with the set of parameters Λ. The generated sequence is the estimated sequence. Therefore, the performance of reproducibility indicates how precisely the model, i.e., the set of parameters Λ decided by the training phase, generates the original sequence.\nFirst, we evaluate the performance of reproducibility when the number of states changes. Figure 19 presents the results of evaluating reproducibility using the HSMM, IS-HSMM and ILPHSMM. The x-axis represents the number of states, and the y-axis represents the performance of reproducibility. The number of observed symbols in a sequence N is N = 7.\nResults show that all of the models obtain higher performance of reproducibility when the number of states increases. The performance results of IS-HSMM and HSMM is mostly the same and IS-HSMM has a bit higher performance than that of HSMM. The results of ILP-HSMM show less performance when the number of states is under six, and those show higher performance when the number of states is over six. It represents that the number of states is more than the number of observed symbols, ILP-HSMM has higher performance of reproducibility than other models.\nThen, we evaluate the performance of reproducibility when the number of intervals in a sequence changes. Figure 20 also shows the scores of performance of reproducibility of HSMM, IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM. The x-axis represents the number of intervals in a sequence, and the y-axis represents the score of modeling performance. The number of sorts observed in a sequence is N = 6. One of the sorts is an interval. Results show that the performance of reproducibility of both models; HSMM and IS-HSMM decrease as the number of intervals increases, but that of IS-HSMM is higher than that of HSMM. Then, the results of ILP-HSMM is the highest performance in all models and it can obtain the highest performance regardless of the number of intervals. Therefore, IS-HSMM can model the sequence with intervals more precisely than HSMM, and ILP-HSMM can model it most precisely in all models. Comparing two results; HSMM and IS-HSMM, it ensures that the proposed IS-HSMM can model the sequential data more precisely than HSMM by introducing the special state, i.e., theinterval stateand calculating the transition probability from the state prior to the interval state. In addition, the performance of IS-HSMM is much higher especially when the states are few and even if many intervals exist in a sequence. Comparing the other results; IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM, it ensures that the proposed ILP-HSMM can model the sequential data more precisely than other models because it can represents the length of intervals directly in the model.\nAs a result of evaluation above, both the proposed extension models for HSMM have higher performance than HSMM, but ILP-HSMM can model the static interval between two states. However, it is more important for modeling the general duration and interval using a model trained\nmultiple data which have the same label. From the view point of modeling generalization, the recognition performance of IS-HSMM has a higher score than other models, especially where the number of sorts of the observation symbols is larger. Therefore, we conclude that IS-HSMM has higher performance for modeling the general sequential data, not only for the data which have a static length of interval, but also for data which have various interval lengths."

      "text" : "The goal of this research was to model sequential data, including state duration and state interval, simultaneously. We specifically examined a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) to treat such sequential data, and propose two extended models to treat state interval in a sequence: IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM. IS-HSMM introduces a special calculation technique to treat interval state, where if the preceding state is an interval state, it models the transition from the second preceding state to the current state simultaneously. On the other hand, ILP-HSMM uses the Gaussian distribution as a length parameter, and trains with both preceding and subsequent states. From the comparisons of recognition performance and elapsed time among IS-HSMM, ILP-HSMM, and HSMM, both of the proposed models give higher performance than HSMM although they need additional calculation costs. The comparison results between IS-HSMM and ILP-HSMM in terms of the modeling performance reveal that ILP-HSMM has higher performance than that of IS-HSMM.\nAs the future directions, we intend to adopt our model to treat such actual sensing data which have a feature of rhythm or timing patterns. While ILP-HSMM has higher performance in the evaluation, the concept of IS-HSMM is simpler than that of ILP-HSMM. Additionally, IS-HSMM can adopt another problem of analyzing the sequential data except for only treating intervals between states. In case that the same state occurs frequently in a sequence, it is difficult to model the original sequence without interval precisely. Therefore, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of treating the original sequence using other application data, and finally extend the model further."

These methods capture the sequential structure of data of interest, such as inputoutput relationship and correlation among datasets. However, since most studies in this area are specialized or limited for their respective applications, rigorous requirement analysis on such a model has not been examined in a general point of view. Hence, we particularly examine the structure of sequential data, and extract the necessity of “state duration” and “state duration” of events for efficient and rich representation of sequential data. Specifically addressing the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents such state duration inside a model, we attempt to newly add representational capability of state interval of events onto HSMM. To this end, we propose two extended models; one is interval state hidden semi-Markov model (IS-HSMM) to express the length of state interval with a special state node designated as “interval state node”. The other is interval length probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which represents the length of state interval with a new probabilistic parameter “interval length probability.” From exhaustive simulations, we show superior performances of the proposed models in comparison with HSMM. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed models are the first extensions of HMM to support state interval representation as well as state duration representation.",
