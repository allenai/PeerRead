In this work, we study MCTS methods in the context of the connection calculus and implement them on top of the leanCoP prover. This includes proposing useful proof-state evaluation heuristics that are learned from previous proofs, and proposing and automatically improving suitable MCTS strategies in this context. The system is trained and evaluated on a large suite of related problems coming from the Mizar proof assistant, showing that it is capable to find new and different proofs. To our knowledge, this is the first time MCTS has been applied to theorem proving."

      "text" : "Proof automation is critical in formal proof verification. In particular, the recent hammer integration of automated theorem provers (ATPs) such as E (Schulz 2013), Vampire (Kovács and Voronkov 2013), CVC4 (Barrett et al. 2011), leanCoP (Otten 2008), and interactive theorem provers (ITPs) such as Isabelle (Wenzel et al. 2008), HOL4 (Slind and Norrish 2008), HOL Light (Harrison 1996), and Mizar (Grabowski et al. 2010) have led to a significant improvement of the usability of ITPs (Blanchette et al. 2016a, Blanchette et al. (2016b), Gauthier and Kaliszyk (2015), Kaliszyk and Urban (2014), Kaliszyk and Urban (2015a)). Today’s automated theorem provers are however still quite weak in finding more complicated proofs over large formal developments. Their search typically blows up after several seconds, making the chance of finding proofs in longer times exponentially decreasing.\n[Copyright notice will appear here once ’preprint’ option is removed.]\nThis behaviour is reminiscent of poorly guided search in games such as Chess and Go. The number of all possible variants there typically also grows exponentially, and intelligent guiding methods are needed to focus on exploring the most promising moves and positions. The guiding method that has recently very significantly improved computer Go is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), i.e., expanding the search based on its (variously guided) random sampling.\nIn this work, we study MCTS methods that can guide the search in automated theorem provers, and evaluate their impact on interactive theorem proving problems. We focus on the connection calculus where the notion of tree search occurs naturally, and on the leanCoP prover, which has a compact implementation that is easy to experiment with. We can also build on previous machine-learning extensions of leanCoP (Kaliszyk and Urban 2015b, Urban et al. (2011)). As shown for example in the recent AlphaGo system (Silver et al. 2016), machine learning can be used to train good position evaluation heuristics even in very complicated domains that were previously thought to be solely in the realm of “human intuition”. This gives a hope for productive use of MCTS in theorem proving. While “finishing the randomly sampled game” – as used in the most straightforward MCTS for games – is rarely possible in ATP (it would mean finishing the proof), there is a chance of learning good proof state evaluation heuristics that will guide the MCTS for ATPs in a similar way as e.g. in AlphaGo.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces MCTS and in particular its recent UCT refinement. Section 3 introduces the connection calculus and proposes modifications that allow combining it with tree search. Section 4 proposes proof state evaluation heuristics. Section 5 describes our implementation, and section 6 evaluates the system on a set of Mizar Mathematical library problems."

It has been applied\n1 2016/11/21\nto a multitude of games and domains, often achieving state-of-the-art results (Browne et al. 2012). One of the most famous MCTS applications is AlphaGo, which is the first program to beat a professional Go player in a tournament without handicap (Silver et al. 2016).\nThe idea of MCTS is to run random play-outs of a game, called simulations, and to choose the move from where the play-outs were most successful. To obtain good results, it is crucial to bias the simulations such that they cover a diverse selection of the state space (exploration), but also that they concentrate on the parts where the most successful play-outs happened (exploitation). One of the most influential methods to balance exploration and exploitation in MCTS has been UCT (Kocsis and Szepesvári 2006). It contributes a strategy to select a subset of the decision space to search next, based on how often the subspace was already searched and what the average outcome of the searches was.\nWe next introduce terminology to describe MCTS problems and present MCTS and UCT algorithms in detail."

In addition to the state, a node contains statistics about the number of times the node was traversed and about the rewards of simulations that were started from and below the node.\nWhen starting MCTS, the decision tree is initialised with a root node that corresponds to the initial state s0 ∈ S. One iteration of the MCTS algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Selection: The MCTS tree is traversed from the root until a leaf (with at least one unexplored successor state) is encountered. 2. Simulation: A (random) simulation is performed starting from the leaf. 3. Expansion: New nodes corresponding to the initial simulation steps are added to the leaf. 4. Backpropagation: The reward of the simulation is backpropagated from the leaf to all nodes up to the root.\nThe actual algorithms used in all four steps are referred to as strategies. Some commonly used strategies are:\n• Simulation strategy: Given a state s, choose as next state some state t ∈ δ(s) randomly biased by δw(s, t). If δ(s) is empty or a maximal simulation depth has been reached, stop the simulation. • Expansion strategy: Add a node corresponding to the first state of the simulation to the leaf. • Backpropagation strategy: Add the reward of the simulation to the rewards of all ancestors and increase their visit counts by one.

The proof search is initialised with the “Start” rule and is successful when all branches of the proof tree are closed by the application of the other rules.

      "text" : "MCTS has been applied to two-player games such as Go (Silver et al. 2016), as well as to single-player games such as SameGame (Schadd et al. 2012). It is possible to model proof search as game with either one or two players. We compare the two approaches.\nIn case of a single player, the player chooses an action to apply to an open proof branch, potentially adding new open proof branches. The player wins when proof branches have been closed, and loses if there exists a proof branch for which no proof rule is applicable.\nIn case of two players, the first player chooses an open proof branch and, if the clause of the branch is\nnot empty, a literal. The second player then applies an action to the chosen proof branch, which has to result either in closing the proof branch or producing at least one new open proof branch with the literal removed from the clause. If the second player is unable to do either of the two, then the first player wins, and if there is no open proof branch left for the first player to choose from, then the second player wins.\nModelling connection proving as a two-player game has the advantage that given an intelligent proof branch evaluation heuristic, the proof search can be directed by the first player towards “harder” proof branches, thus more quickly resulting in the termination of proof search in branches that cannot be closed. On the other hand, a similar behaviour can be achieved by pre-ordering the proof branches in the single-player game. However, if we model connection proving as a two-player game following the default UCT selection policy, every possible move of the first player has to be considered at least once. Even if one restricts the first player to choose only literals from a single proof branch clause, this can considerably blow up the search space. We therefore focus on connection proving as a single-player game."

As closed proof trees in the branching and non-branching connection calculi are isomorphic, the non-branching calculus preserves soundness and completeness. With this calculus, we can give the rules of connection proving as in subsection 2.1:\n• The set of states S is the set of tuples (Goals, σ), where Goals is a set of clause-path pairs and σ is a substitution. • The initial state s0 is ({({⊤}, {})}, {}). ¬⊤ has to be added to all positive clauses in M to correctly emulate the start rule of the branching connection calculus. • The state transition function δ(s) returns all possible premises of non-branching connection calculus rules that have s as conclusion.1\nIn the remainder of this and the following section, we discuss possible MCTS heuristics."

It is possible to use MCTS in such a way as an oracle in a conventional theorem prover: Given a prover state with high uncertainty as to which proof step is most appropriate (for example when having to select between several extension clauses), one can run MCTS and obtain the most promising next proof step, resuming the conventional proof search from there.\nThis approach has two problems. First, it is unclear in which situations it is beneficial to run MCTS instead of searching all proof options exhaustively. Second, extracting only the first best successor node of the Monte Carlo search tree discards all the statistics in the search tree about the quality of follow-up states.\nFor this reason, we follow a different approach, namely we use MCTS as driving force to control the proof search: In every MCTS iteration, a short proof search is performed, and the reward function controls which parts of the search space the proof search concentrates on, depending on the outcomes of the previous proof searches. A similar approach is taken in (Schadd et al. 2012).\nAs selection strategy, we use UCT as described in subsection 2.3, and as backpropagation strategy, we use the MCTS default strategy as described in section 2."

Next, one of the successor states is randomly picked, biased with the transition weight δw, and the simulation is continued with the picked successor state. During the simulation no backtracking is done, as it would require storing search history information in the prover state.\nThe simulation returns the sequence of traversed states up to the current state s if either δ(s) is the empty set, i.e. no proof rule is applicable, or some maximum simulation depth is reached. In case that s has no more open subgoals, i.e. a proof has been found, the proof is returned.\n4 2016/11/21\nTo bias the selection of successor states, we assign a constant weight to reduction steps and focus on influencing the weight of extension steps in function of the corresponding extension clauses:\n• Constant: Potential extension steps have the same weight. • Inverse size: Extension clause is weighed with the inverse number of literals it contains. • Rank: Extension clauses are weighed by the inverse of the number of smaller extension clauses.\nSelection of extension steps using machine-learning, similar to FEMaLeCoP (Kaliszyk and Urban 2015b), is left as future work."

      "text" : "Once the simulation strategy has finished with a resulting sequence of states, the expansion strategy is responsible for adding a new child node to the node n the simulation has started from. Since the chance of revisiting a node sharply decreases with its depth, most deeper nodes will not be visited again and storing them all takes up significant amount of memory. Therefore, we add only a single leaf node to the starting node n. Considering deeper subtrees in function of the expected number of future visits to the node, in order to minimise the costly recalculation of successor states, could be considered in future work.\nOur leaf-adding expansion strategies are:\n• First-node expansion: This strategy adds the first node of the simulation, i.e. the previously unvisited action of the chosen node to its parent node. • Best-node expansion: This strategy takes the state of the simulation with the lowest number of subgoals and adds it to the chosen node. When a node has a lower number of subgoals than the starting node, at least one subgoal was closed. Adding only that node to the tree discards all other options to close the branch. This is similar to the cut heuristic in leanCoP, which makes proof search incomplete, but reduces the search space.\nThe first-node expansion strategy preserves completeness. Consider the leafs of a Monte Carlo search tree. They represent all possible ways to prove the original conjecture, and all of its successor states preserve this invariant. Since rewards are between 0 and 1, we can show that for Cp > 0, any leaf of the search tree will be selected at some point. This is because the exploration term of any node will become large enough for that node to be visited, regardless of its average reward."

For example, in a chess game it is not required to find a function that estimates how likely a player will win the game, but it is only necessary to determine at the end of a game which player won and perhaps by how much. However, in theorem proving, we are very rarely able to play a game to the end with a clear outcome, meaning that we still need to estimate the success of branches. Even if we encounter a branch where we are not able to continue to proof, thus being in a final state, that may not be considered a “loss” in the game sense because we might just have a single mistake that made us unable to finish the proof. It is clear that we need a more finegrained notion of “success” to estimate such situations’ potential to lead to a proof by choosing slightly different decisions."

We have devised several methods to estimate the quality of a branch. The linear combination of their estimates constitutes the reward function r(s) of our Monte Carlo Connection Prover.\nThe first method is based on the fact that towards the end of a proof, the number of open subgoals goes to zero, and the number of open subgoals is always smaller or equal to the number of previously opened subgoals. So the first reward function for a state is just the ratio of open and previously opened subgoals.\nThe second method is based on data collected during previous proof attempts. We assume that certain goals are statistically easier to close than others, and also certain literals of goals are easier than others. This is similar to the approach taken in e.g. FEMaLeCoP (Kaliszyk and Urban 2015b), which prefers proof steps involving previously “successful” clauses. However, where FEMaLeCoP only needs to establish an order on a finite set of clauses that are applicable in a particular situation, we need to establish an order on a potentially infinite set of states. Furthermore, while FEMaLeCoP estimates the usefulness of a clause for the current state, we have to evaluate the state itself, putting it into relation with any other state.

If we have seen it in proofs being successfully proved for p and unsuccessfully proved for n times, then the success rate is p\np+n .

However, in our experiments it became quite clear that this very frequently gave rewards of 0, because a single literal in a single clause that had a bad ranking could deteriorate the reward.

To approach this, we first created a version of FEMaLeCoP that uses lazy lists instead of continuations to represent different proof options: To close a subgoal, there might be different reduction and extension steps. So for a given literal l, we return a lazy list of proof trees that prove l. We can then filter out only closed proof trees and backtrack by going through the list of proof trees.

For that reason, we experimented with an oscillating Cp(i) = Cp,0 + a sin(2π i T ), where i is the number of the current MCTS iteration, a is the oscillation amplitude and T is the oscillation period. Unfortunately, this did not yield a substantial improvement.\nWe were surprised to see that the best-node expansion strategy (see subsection 3.6) corresponding to the leanCoP cut strategy solved only 14 problems.\nWe tried random rewards in the range [0, 1], which proved exactly as many problems as constant reward. This is because the selection strategy calculates the average reward from all previous simulations, which for the random rewards converges to 0.5 for all nodes.\n(Schadd et al. 2012) suggests running MCTS multiple times with different random seeds to avoid MCTS getting stuck in local maxima. We tried this in combination with rerunning the same problem with multiple values of the exploration constant Cp for a shorter time, however, this did not achieve any improvement."

We evaluated it on two datasets, where on one dataset, our system was able to prove 17.9% new problems compared to a conventional connection prover. One can use our system as advisor in a theorem prover to choose between different possible proof steps. As future work, new prover state evaluation heuristics, e.g. using neural networks, might help to better estimate promising regions of the proof search."
