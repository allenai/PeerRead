      "text" : "The study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by Dung [12] has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning, see, e.g., [3, 6, 24]. Argumentation handles possible conflicts between arguments in form of attacks. The arguments may either originate from a dialogue between several agents or from the pieces of information at the disposal of a single agent, this information may even contain contradictions. A main issue for any argumentation system is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments, where an acceptable set of arguments must be in some sense coherent and be able to defend itself against all attacking arguments. Abstract argumentation provides suitable concepts and formalisms to study, represent, and process various reasoning problems most prominently in defeasible reasoning (see, e.g., [23], [8]) and agent interaction (see, e.g., [22]).\nExtending Dung’s concept, Bench-Capon [4] introduced value-based argumentation systems that allow to compare arguments with respect to their relative strength such that an argument cannot successfully attack another argument that is considered of a higher rank. The ranking is specified by the combination of an assignment of values to arguments and an ordering of the values; the latter is called an audience [5]. As laid out by BenchCapon, the role of arguments in this setting is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Whether an argument can be accepted with respect to all possible or at least one audience allows to formalize the notions of objective acceptance and subjective acceptance, respectively.\n∗Ordyniak and Szeider’s research was supported by the European Research Council, grant reference 239962. Kim’s research was partially supported by the EPSRC, grant reference EP/E034985/1.\n†A preliminary and shortened version of this paper appeared in COMMA 2010.\nAn important limitation for using value-based argumentation systems in real-world applications is the computational intractability of the two basic acceptance problems: deciding whether a given argument is subjectively accepted is NP-hard, deciding whether it is objectively accepted is co-NP-hard [15]. Therefore it is important to identify classes of value-based systems that are still useful and expressible but allow a polynomial-time tractable acceptance decision. However, no non-trivial tractable classes of value-based systems have been identified so far, except for systems with a tree structure where the degree of nodes and the number of nodes of degree exceeding 2 are bounded [14]. In fact, as pointed out by Dunne [13], the acceptance problems remain intractable for valuebased systems whose graphical structures form trees, in strong contrast to the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation that are linear-time tractable for tree systems, or more generally, for systems of bounded treewidth [13] .\nOur Contribution In this paper we introduce nontrivial classes of value-based systems for which the acceptance problems are tractable. The classes are defined in terms of the following notions:\n• The value-width of a value-based system is the largest number of arguments of the same value.\n• The extended graph structure of a value-based system has as nodes the arguments of the value-based system, two arguments are joined by an edge if either one attacks the other or both share the same value.\n• The value graph of a value-based system has as vertices the values of the system, two values v1 and v2 are joined by a directed edge if some argument of value v1 attacks an argument of value v2 [14].\nWe show that the acceptance problems are tractable for the following classes of value-based systems:\n(P1) value-based systems with a bipartite graph structure where at most two arguments share the same value (i.e., systems of value-width 2);\n(P2) value-based systems whose extended graph structure has bounded treewidth; and\n(P3) value-based systems of bounded value-width whose value graphs have bounded treewidth.\nIn fact, we show that both acceptance problems are linear time tractable for the classes (P2) and (P3), the latter being a subclass of the former. Our results suggest that the extended graph structure is a suitable structural representation of value-based argumentation systems. The positive results (P1)–(P3) hold for systems with unbounded number of arguments, attacks and values.\nWe contrast our positive results with negative results that rule out classes conjectured to be tractable. We show that the acceptance problems are (co)-NP-hard for the following classes:\n(N1) value-based systems of value-width 2;\n(N2) value-based systems where the number of attacks between arguments of the same value is bounded (systems of bounded attack-width);\n(N3) value-based systems with bipartite value graphs.\nIn fact, we show that both acceptance problems are intractable for value-based systems of value-width 2 and attack-width 1. Classes (N1) and (N2) were conjectured to be tractable [13], the complexity of (N3) was stated as an open problem [14].\nThe reminder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide basic definitions and preliminaries. In Section 3 we define the parameters value-width and attack-width and establish the results involving systems of value-width 2, we also discuss the relationship between systems of value-width 2 and dialogues [5]. In Section 4 we consider value-based systems with an extended graph structure of bounded treewidth and show linear time tractability. We close in Section 5 with concluding remarks. Some proofs of technical lemmas are given in an appendix.\nThe main results of this paper have been presented in preliminary and shortened form at COMMA’10 [21]. Here we provide full proofs, examples, and additional discussions. Further new additions are the results (P3) and (N3) involving value graphs, and the discussion of the relationship between systems of value-width 2 and dialogues."

      "text" : "Definition 1. An abstract argumentation system or argumentation framework is a pair (X,A) where X is a finite set of elements called arguments and A ⊆ X ×X is a binary relation called the attack relation. If (x, y) ∈ A we say that x attacks y.\nAn abstract argumentation system F = (X,A) can be considered as a directed graph, and therefore it is convenient to borrow notions and notation from the theory of directed graphs [1]. For example we say that a system F = (X,A) is acyclic if (X,A) is a DAG (a directed acyclic graph).\nExample 1. An abstract argumentation system F0 = (X,A) with arguments X = {a, b, c, d, e, f} and attacks A = {(a, d), (a, e), (b, a), (c, d), (d, b), (f, c)} is displayed in Figure 1.\nNext we define commonly used semantics of abstract argumentation systems as introduced by Dung [12]. For the discussion of other semantics and variants, see, e.g., Baroni and Giacomin’s survey [2]. Let F = (X,A) be an abstract argumentation system and S ⊆ X .\n1. S is conflict-free in F if there is no (x, y) ∈ A with x, y ∈ S.\n2. S is acceptable in F if for each x ∈ S and each y ∈ X with (y, x) ∈ A there is some x′ ∈ S with (x′, y) ∈ A.\n3. S is admissible in F if it is conflict-free and acceptable.\n4. S is a preferred extension of F if S is admissible in F and there is no admissible set S′ of F that properly contains S.\nFor instance, the admissible sets of the abstract argumentation system F0 of Example 1 are the sets ∅ and {f}, hence {f} is its only preferred extension.\nLet F = (X,A) be an abstract argumentation system and x1 ∈ X . The argument x1 is credulously accepted in F if x1 is contained in some preferred extension of F , and x1 is skeptically accepted in F if x1 is contained in all preferred extensions of F .\nIn this paper we are especially interested in finding preferred extensions in acyclic abstract argumentation systems. It is well known that every acyclic system F = (X,A) has a unique preferred extension GE(F ), and that GE(F ) can be found in polynomial time (GE(F ) coincides with the “grounded extension” [12]). In fact, GE(F ) can be found via a simple labeling procedure that repeatedly applies the following two rules to the arguments in X until each of them is either labeled IN or OUT:\n1. An argument x is labeled IN if all arguments that attack x are labeled OUT (in particular, if x is not attacked by any argument).\n2. An argument x is labeled OUT if it is attacked by some argument that is labeled IN.\nThe unique preferred extension GE(F ) is then the set of all arguments that are labeled IN."

A value-based argumentation framework or value-based system is a tuple F = (X,A, V, η) where (X,A) is an argumentation framework, V is a set of values, and η is a mapping X → V such that the abstract argumentation system Fv = (η−1(v), { (x, y) ∈ A | x, y ∈ η−1(v) }) is acyclic for all v ∈ V .\nWe call two arguments x, y ∈ X to be equivalued (in F ) if η(x) = η(y).\nThe requirement for Fv to be acyclic is also known as the Multivalued Cycles Assumption, as it implies that any set of arguments that form a directed cycle in F = (X,A) will contain at least two arguments that are not equivalued [4].\nDefinition 3. An audience for a value-based system F is a partial ordering ≤ on the set V of values of F . An audience ≤ is specific if it is a total ordering on V .\nFor an audience ≤ we also define < in the obvious way, i.e., x < y if and only if x ≤ y and x 6= y.\nDefinition 4. Given a value-based system F = (X,A, V, η) and an audience ≤ for F , we define the abstract argumentation system induced by ≤ from F as F≤ = (X,A≤) with A≤ = { (x, y) ∈ A | ¬(η(x) < η(y)) }.\nNote that if ≤ is a specific audience, then F≤ = (X,A≤) is an acyclic system and thus, as discussed above, has a unique preferred extension GE(F≤).\nExample 2. Consider the value-based system F = (X,A, V, η) obtained from the abstract argumentation framework F0 of Example 1 by adding the set of values V = {S,E, T } and the mapping η with η(a) = η(b) = S, η(c) = η(d) = E, η(e) = η(f) = T . The value-based system F is depicted in Figure 1 where the three ellipses indicate arguments that share the same value.\nDefinition 5. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system. We say that an argument x1 ∈ X is subjectively accepted in F if there exists a specific audience ≤ such that x1 is in the unique preferred extension of F≤. Similarly, we say that an argument x1 ∈ X is objectively accepted in F if x1 is contained in the unique preferred extension of F≤ for every specific audience ≤.\nExample 3. Consider our running example, the value-based system F given in Example 2. Suppose F represents the interaction of arguments regarding a city development project, and assume the arguments a, b are related to sustainability issues (S), the arguments c, d are related to economics (E), and the arguments e, f are related to traffic issues (T ).\nNow, consider the specific audience ≤ that gives highest priority to sustainability, medium priority to economics, and lowest priority to traffic (S > E > T ). This audience gives rise to the acyclic abstract argumentation system F≤ obtained from F by deleting the attack (d, b) (as η(b) = S > E = η(d), d cannot attack b with respect to the audience) and deleting the attack (f, c) (as η(c) = E > T = η(f), f cannot attack c with respect to the audience).\nFigure 2 exhibits the acyclic abstract argumentation systems induced by the six possible specific audiences. The unique preferred extension for each of the six systems is indicated by shaded nodes. We conclude that all arguments of F are subjectively accepted, and e, f are the arguments that are objectively accepted."

      "text" : "In view of the general intractability of SUBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE, the main decision problems for value-based systems, it is natural to ask which restrictions on shape and structure of valuebased systems allow tractability.\nA natural approach is to impose structural restrictions in terms of certain graphical models associated with value-based systems. We present three graphical models: the graph structure (an undirected graph on the arguments of the value-based system under consideration, edges represent attacks) the value graph (a directed graph on the values of the value-based system under consideration, edges represent attacks) and the extended graph structure (an undirected graph on the arguments of the value-based system under consideration, edges represent attacks and “equivaluedness”). The concept of value graphs was recently introduced and studied by Dunne [14]. The concept of extended graph structures is our new contribution.\nDefinition 6. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system. The graph structure of F is the (undirected) graph GF = (X,E) whose vertices are the arguments of F and where two arguments x, y are joined by an edge (in symbols xy ∈ E) if and only if X contains the attack (x, y) or the attack (y, x).\nThe value graph of F is the directed graph GvalF = (V,E) whose vertices are the values of F and where two values u, v are joined by a directed edge from u to v (in symbols (u, v) ∈ E) if and only if there exist some argument x ∈ X with η(x) = u, some argument y ∈ X with η(y) = v, and (x, y) ∈ A.\nThe extended graph structure of F is the (undirected) graph GextF = (X,E) whose vertices are the arguments of F and where two arguments x, y are joined by an edge if and only if (x, y) ∈ A or η(x) = η(y).\nFigure 3 shows the value-based system of Example 2 and the three associated graphical models.\nDefinition 7.

      "text" : "Dunne [13] suggested to consider restrictions on the number of arguments that share the same value, and the number of attacks between equivalued arguments. We state these restrictions in terms of the following notions.\nDefinition 8. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system. The value-width of F is the largest number of arguments that share the same value, i.e., maxv∈V |η−1(v)|. The attack-width of F is the cardinality of the set { (x, y) ∈ A | η(x) = η(y) }.\nFor instance, the value-based system of Example 2 has value-width 2 and attack-width 2. Value-based systems of value-width 1 are not very interesting: Every argument x in such a value-based system is subjectively accepted (x is accepted with respect to any specific audience where η(x) is largest), and objectively accepted if and only if x is not attacked by any argument y (if y attacks x then x is not accepted with respect to any specific audience where η(y) is largest). Thus, for value-based systems of value-width 1 the problems SUBJECTIVE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE are trivial, and the expressive power of such value-based systems is very limited.\nOn the other hand, value-based systems of value-width 3 are already too expressive to allow a tractable acceptance decision: Dunne [13] showed that the problems SUBJECTIVE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE are intractable (NP-complete and co-NP-complete, respectively) for value-based systems of value-width 3, even if their graph structure is a tree.\nThis leaves the intermediate class of value-based systems of value-width 2 as an interesting candidate for a tractable class. In fact, Dunne [13] conjectured that both acceptance problems are polynomial-time decidable for value-based systems of value-width 2. He also conjectured that the problems are polynomial for value-based systems with an attack-width that is bounded by a constant. We disprove both conjectures and show that the problems remain intractable for value-based systems of value-width 2 and (simultaneously) of attack-width 1.\nOn the positive side, we show that under the additional assumption that the value-based system is bipartite (that entails value-based systems whose graph structures are trees) both acceptance problems can be decided in polynomial time for value-based systems of value-width 2.\nTheorem 1. (A) SUBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE remains NP-hard for value-based systems of value-width 2 and attack-width 1. (B) OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE remains co-NP-hard for value-based systems of value-width 2 and attack-width 1.\nTheorem 2. (A) SUBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE can be decided in polynomial time for bipartite value-based systems of value-width 2. (B) OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE can be decided in polynomial time for bipartite value-based systems of value-width 2.\nIn the remainder of this section we will demonstrate the two theorems."

      "text" : "The key to the proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 is the notion of a “certifying path” which defines a certain path-like substructure within a value-based system. We show that in value-based systems of value-width 2, the problems of SUBJECTIVE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE can be expressed in terms of certifying paths. We then show that in general finding a certifying path in a value-based system of value-width 2 is NP-hard (3SAT can be expressed in terms of certifying paths) but is easy if the system is bipartite.\nDefinition 9. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system of value-width 2. We call an odd-length sequence C = (x1, z1, . . . , xk, zk, t), k ≥ 0, of distinct arguments a certifying path for x1 ∈ X in F if it satisfies the following conditions:\nC1 For every 1 ≤ i ≤ k it holds that η(zi) = η(xi).\nC2 For every 1 ≤ i ≤ k there exists a 1 ≤ j ≤ i such that zi attacks xj .\nC3 For every 2 ≤ i ≤ k it holds that xi attacks zi−1 but xi does not attack any argument in {zi, x1, . . . , xi−1}.\nC4 Argument t attacks zk but it does not attack any argument in {x1, . . . , xk}.\nC5 If there exists an argument z ∈ X \\ {t} with η(z) = η(t) then either t attacks z or z does not attack any argument in {x1, . . . , xk, t}.\nLemma 1. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system of value-width 2 and x1 ∈ X . Then x1 is subjectively accepted in F if and only if there exists a certifying path for x1 in F .\nThe rather technical proof of this lemma is given in the appendix. We discuss the intuition behind the concept of certifying paths by means of an example.\nExample 4. Consider the value-based system F of Example 2. We want to check whether argument a is subjectively accepted, i.e., to identify a specific audience ≤ such that a is in the unique preferred extension GE(F≤) of F≤. Since a is attacked by b and we cannot eliminate this attack (a and b are equivalued), we need to defend a by attacking b. The only possibility for that is to attack b by d. Hence we need to put S < E in our audience. However, since d is attacked by the equivalued argument c, we need to defend it by attacking c by f , hence we need to put S < E < T . Since f is not attacked by any other argument we can stop. Via this process we have produced a certifying path Ca = (a, b, d, c, f), and we can check that Ca indeed satisfies Definition 9. For the other subjectively accepted arguments of F we have the certifying paths Cb = (b), Cc = (c), Cd = (d, c, f), Ce = (e) and Cf = (f).\nIn order to use the concept of certifying paths for objective acceptance, we need the following definition.\nDefinition 10. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system and v ∈ V a value. We denote by F − v the valuebased system obtained from F by deleting all arguments with value v and all attacks involving these arguments.\nLemma 2. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system of value-width 2 and x1 ∈ X . Then x1 is objectively accepted in F if and only if for every argument p ∈ X that attacks x1 it holds that η(p) 6= η(x1) and p is not subjectively accepted in F − η(x1).\nAgain, the technical proof is moved to the appendix.\nExample 5. In our example, consider the argument e. We want to check whether e is objectively accepted. Since e is only attacked by a, and since η(a) 6= η(e), it remains to check whether a is not subjectively accepted in F − η(e). In fact, F − η(e) contains no certifying path for a. Hence e is objectively accepted in F ."

Φ is satisfiable if and only if x1 is subjectively accepted in F .\nProof. First we note that every certifying path for x1 in F must have the form (x1, z1, x i1 1 , z i1 1 , x2, z2, x i2 2 , z i2 2 , x3, z3, . . . , xm, zm, ximm , z im m , t) where ij ∈ {1, 2, 3} for every 1 ≤ j ≤ m and for every pair 1 ≤ j < j ′ ≤ m there is no attack (x ij′\nj′ , x ij j ) ∈ A. Hence there exists a certifying path for x1 in F if and only if there exists a set\nL of literals that corresponds to a satisfying truth assignment of Φ (i.e., L contains a literal of each clause of Φ but does not contain a complementary pair of literals).\nIn order to show part (B) of Theorem 1, let F be the value-based system as constructed above and define F ′ = (X ′, A′, V ′, η′) to be the value-based system with\n1. X ′ := X ∪ {x0},\n2. A′ := A ∪ {(x1, x0)},\n3. V ′ := V ∪ {v0},\n4. η′(x0) = v0 and η′(x) = η(x) for every x ∈ X .\nPart (B) of Theorem 1 follows from the following claim which follows from Claim 1 and Lemma 2.\nClaim 2. Φ is satisfiable if and only if x0 is not objectively accepted in F ′.\nBy a slight modification of the above reduction we can also show the following, answering a research question recently posed by Dunne [14].

      "text" : "Bench-Capon, Doutre, and Dunne [5] developed a general dialogue framework that allows to describe the acceptance of arguments in a value-based system in terms of a game, played by two players, the proponent and the opponent. The proponent tries to prove that a certain argument (or a set of arguments) is accepted, the opponent tries to circumvent the proof. An argument is subjectively accepted if the proponent has a winning strategy, that is, she is able to prove the acceptance regardless of her opponent’s moves.\nIn the following we outline a simplified version of the dialogue framework that applies to value-based systems of value-width 2. We will see that certifying paths correspond to winning strategies for the proponent.\nLet F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system of value-width 2. We have two players, the proponent and the opponent, who make moves in turn, at each move asserting a new argument. This produces a sequence (x1, y1, x2, y2 . . . ) of arguments and a set of audiences ≤ with η(x1) = η(y2) < η(x2) = η(y2) < . . . . The proponent has the first move, where she asserts the query argument x1 whose subjective acceptance is under consideration. After each move of the proponent, asserting argument xi, the opponent asserts a new argument yi ∈ X \\ {x1, y1, . . . , xi−1, yi−1, xi} which has the same value as xi but is not attacked by xi, and attacks some argument asserted by the proponent. If no such argument yi exists, the proponent has won the game. After each move of the opponent asserting an argument yi, it is again the proponent’s turn to assert a new argument xi+1 ∈ X \\ {x1, y1, . . . , xi, yi}. This argument xi+1 must attack the opponent’s last argument yi, but must not attack any argument asserted by the proponent. If no such argument xi+1 exists, the proponent has lost the game. Because the value-width of F is assumed to be 2, the opponent has at most one choice for each move. Therefore, the proponent’s wining strategy does not need to consider several possibilities for the opponent’s counter move. Hence, a winning strategy is not a tree but just a path and can be identified with a sequence (x1, y1, . . . , xn−1, yn−1, xn) that corresponds to a play won by the proponent. It is easy to verify that such a sequence is exactly a certifying path.\nExample 6. Consider again the value-based system F of Example 2. The proponent wants to prove that argument a is subjectively accepted in F and asserts a with her first move. Now, it is the opponent’s turn. He has no other choice but to assert b (the only argument different from a with the same value as a). Now, it is again the proponent’s turn. She must assert an argumentx /∈ {a, b} that attacks b but does not attack a. Argument d satisfies this property (it happens that this is the only choice). Next, the opponent asserts c, and the proponent asserts f , and it is again the opponent’s turn. The only argument with the same value as f is argument e, but e does not attack any of the arguments in {a, d, f}. Hence, the proponent wins. The sequence of arguments (a, b, d, c, f) produced by this play is indeed a certifying path for a in F . Hence a is subjectively accepted."

Note that z ∈ Xodd since F is bipartite.\nLemma 4. If C = (x1, z1, . . . , xk, zk, t) is a certifying path for x1 in F , then (η(t), η(xk), . . . , η(x1)) is a directed path from η(t) to η(x1) in HF .\nProof. By the definition of a certifying path, we have (t, zk) ∈ A and for every 2 ≤ i ≤ k it holds that (xi, zi−1) ∈ A. Lemma 3 implies that for t and xi are contained in Xeven for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k, and hence (η(t), η(xk)), (η(xi), η(xi−1)) ∈ E for every 1 < i ≤ k.\nLemma 4 tells us that each certifying path in F gives rise to a directed path in HF .\nExample 7. Figure 5 shows a bipartite value-based system F and the associated auxiliary graph HF . The query argument is x1. Hence Xeven = {x1, . . . , x5} and Xodd = {z1, . . . , z5}. The query argument x1 is subjectively accepted in F as C = (x1, z1, x2, z2, x4, z4, x5) is a certifying path for x1 in F . Indeed, C gives rise to the directed path v5, v4, v2, v1 (i.e., η(x5), η(x4), η(x2), η(x1)) in HF , as promised by Lemma 4.\nIt would be desirable if we could find certifying paths by searching for directed paths in HF . However, not every directed path in HF gives rise to a certifying path in F . To overcome this obstacle, we consider for each value v ∈ V the subgraph H−vF of HF which is obtained as follows:\nIf there is an argument z ∈ Xodd ∩ η−1(v) that is not attacked by some equivalued argument, then for every argument y ∈ Xeven that is attacked by z we remove the vertex η(y) from HF .\nFigure 5 shows the graphs H−vF for the value-based system F of Example 7.\nLemma 5. Consider an odd-length sequence C = (x1, z1, . . . , xk, zk, t) of distinct arguments of a bipartite value-based system F of value width 2. Then C is a certifying path for x1 in F if and only if the following conditions hold:\n(1) η(xi) = η(zi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.\n(2) (η(t), η(xk), . . . , η(x1)) is a directed path from η(t) to η(x1) in H −η(t) F .\n(3) None of the sub-sequences η(xi), . . . , η(x1) is a directed path from η(xi) to η(x1) inH −η(xi) F for 1 ≤ i ≤ k.\nProof. Assume C = (x1, z1, . . . , xk, zk, t) is a certifying path for x1 in F . Property (1) follows from condition C1 of a certifying path, property (2) follows from condition C5 and Lemma 4. Property (3) follows from conditions C2 and C3.\nTo see the reverse assume that C satisfies properties (1)–(3). Condition C1 follows from property (1). Conditions C3, C4 and C5 follow from property (2) and the assumption that F is bipartite. Condition C2 follows from property (3). Hence C is a certifying path for x1 in F .\nIndeed, consider the certifying path C of Example 7 which gives rise to the sequence of values v5, v4, v2, v1. This sequence is a directed path in H−v5F , however v4, v2, v1 is not a directed path in H −v4 F , v2, v1 is not a directed path in H−v2F , and v1 is not a directed path in H −v1 F .\nLemma 5 suggests a simple strategy for finding a certifying path for x1 in F , if one exists. For each value v we search for a directed path vk, . . . , v1 from v = vk to v1 = η(x1) in H −v F . If we find such a path vk, . . . , v1, we check for each subsequence vi, . . . , v1, 1 ≤ i < k, whether it is a directed path in H −vi F . If the answer is NO for all i, then vk, . . . , v1 satisfies the conditions of Lemma 5. Hence the sequence of arguments in X whose values form P is a certifying path for x1 in F . If, however, the answer is YES for some i < k, we take the smallest i for which the answer is YES. Now the sequence vi, . . . , v1 satisfies the conditions of Lemma 5 and so gives rise to a certifying path for x1 in F . On the other hand, if there is no value v such that H −v F contains a directed path from v to v1, then there is no certifying path for x1 in F . The pseudo code for this algorithm is given in Figure 6.\nProposition 1. The algorithm DETECT CERTIFYING PATH correctly returns a certifying path for x1 in F = (X,A, V, η) if one exists and returns NO otherwise in time O(|V |2 · (|X |+ |A|+ |V |)).\nProof. The correctness of DETECT CERTIFYING PATH follows from Lemma 5. For v ∈ V , building H−vF and finding a shortest directed path from v to v1 = η(x1), if one exists, takes linear time in the input size of F (which we estimate by the term O(|X |+ |A|+ |V |)). As we iterate over all vertices of V , and we check for at most |V | subsequences vi, . . . , v1 whether it is a directed path in H −vi F , the claimed running time follows.\nWe are now ready to combine the above results to a proof of Theorem 2. Statement (A) of the theorem follows from Lemma 1 and Proposition 1. Statement (B) follows from Statement (A) and Lemma 2."

      "text" : "As mentioned above, it is known that both acceptance problems remain intractable for value-based systems whose graph structure is a tree. This is perhaps not surprising since two arguments can be considered as linked to each other if they share the same value. In fact, such links may form cycles in an otherwise tree-shaped valuebased system. Therefore we propose to consider the extended graph structure of the value-based system (recall Definition 6 in Section 2.4) that takes such links into account. We show that the problems SUBJECTIVE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE are easy for value-based systems whose extended graph structure is a tree, and more generally, the problems can be solved in linear-time for value-based systems with an extended graph structure of bounded treewidth.\nTreewidth is a popular graph parameter that indicates in a certain sense how similar a graph is to a tree. Many otherwise intractable graph problems (such as 3-COLORABILITY) become tractable for graphs of bounded treewidth. Bounded treewidth (and related concepts like induced width and d-tree width) have been successfully applied in many areas of AI, see, e.g., [18, 11, 10, 20]. Deciding acceptance for argumentation frameworks of bounded treewidth has been investigated by Dunne [13] and by Dvorák, Pichler, and Woltran [16]. However, for value-based argumentation, the concept of bounded tree-width has not been applied successfully: the basic decision problems for value-based systems remain intractable for value-based systems of value width 3 whose graph structure has treewidth 1 [13]. Hardness even prevails for value-based systems whose value graph has pathwidth 2 [14]. These negative results are contrasted by our Theorem 3, which indicates that the extended graph structure seems to be a suitable and adequate graphical model for value-based systems.\nThe treewidth of a graph is defined using the following notion of a tree decomposition (see, e.g., [7]).\nDefinition 11. A tree decomposition of an (undirected) graph G = (V,E) is a pair (T, χ) where T is a tree and χ is a labeling function that assigns each tree node t a set χ(t) of vertices of the graph G such that the following conditions hold:\n1. Every vertex of G occurs in χ(t) for some tree node t.\n2. For every edge {u, v} of G there is a tree node t such that u, v ∈ χ(t).\n3. For every vertex v of G, the tree nodes t with v ∈ χ(t) form a connected subtree of T .\nThe width of a tree decomposition (T, χ) is the size of a largest bag χ(t) minus 1 among all nodes t of T . A tree decomposition of smallest width is optimal. The treewidth of a graph G is the width of an optimal tree decomposition of G.\nExample 8. Figure 7 exhibits a graph (the extended graph structure of the value-based system of Example 2) and a tree decomposition of it. The width of the tree decomposition is 2, and it is not difficult to see that this is optimal. Hence the treewidth of the graph in the figure is 2."

      "text" : "We are going to establish the following result.\nTheorem 3. The problems SUBJECTIVE and OBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE can be decided in linear time for valuebased systems whose extended graph structure has bounded treewidth.\nTo achieve tractability we have to pay a price in generality: The mentioned hardness results of [14, 13] imply that if SUBJECTIVE ACCEPTANCE is fixed-parameter tractable for any parameter p, then, unless P = NP, parameter p cannot be bounded by a function of any of the following three parameters: the treewidth of the graph structure, the treewidth of the value graph, and the value-width. This even holds if the bounding function is exponential. Indeed, the treewidth of the extended graph structure can be arbitrarily large for value-based systems where one of these three parameters is bounded by a constant.\nThe reminder of this section is devoted to a proof of Theorem 3. We shall take a logic approach and use the celebrated result of Courcelle [9], which states that all properties that can be expressed in a certain formalism (Monadic Second-Order logic, MSO) can be checked in linear time for graphs (or more generally, for finite structures) of bounded treewidth. Courcelle’s Theorem is constructive in the sense that it not only promises the existence of an algorithm for the particular problem under consideration, but it provides the means for actually producing such an algorithm. The algorithm produced in this general and generic way leaves much room for improvement and provides the basis for the development of problem-specific and more practical algorithms.\nIn the following we use Courcelle’s result as laid out by Flume and Grohe [17]. Let S denote a finite relational structure and ϕ a sentence in monadic second-order logic (MSO logic) on S. That is, ϕ may contain quantification over atoms (elements of the universe) and over sets of atoms. Furthermore, we associate with the structure S its Gaifman graph G(S), whose vertices are the atoms of S, and where two distinct vertices are joined by an edge if and only if they occur together in some tuple of a relation of S. We define the treewidth of structure S as the treewidth of its Gaifman graph G(S). Now Courcelle’s theorem states that for a fixed MSO sentence ϕ and a fixed integer k, one can check in linear time whether ϕ holds for a given relational structure of treewidth at most k. The proof of Theorem 3 boils down to the following two tasks:\nTask A. To represent a value-based system F and a query argument x1 by a relational structure S[F, x1] such that bounded treewidth of the extended graph structure of F implies bounded treewidth of S[F, x1].\nTask B. To construct formulas ϕs and ϕo in MSO logic such that for every value-based system F and every argument x1 of F it holds that ϕs is true for S[F, x1] if and only if x1 is subjectively accepted in F , and ϕo is true for S[F, x1] if and only if x1 is objectively accepted in F ."

      "text" : "For many problems it is rather straight-forward to find an MSO formulation so that Courcelle’s Theorem can be applied. In our case, however, we have to face the difficulty that we have to express that “a certain property holds for some total ordering” (subjective acceptance) and “a certain property holds for all total orderings” (objective acceptance), which cannot be directly expressed in MSO. Our solution to this problem lies in the introduction of an auxiliary directed graph R, the reference graph, which will allow us to quantify over total orderings of V . The relational structure S[F, x1] will then be defined to represent F together with R.\nDefinition 12. Let F = (X,A, V, η) be a value-based system and let ≺ be an arbitrary but fixed total ordering of V . The reference graph R = (V,ER) is the directed graph where V is the set of values of F and ER consists of all directed edges (u, v) for which\n1. u ≺ v in the fixed ordering, and\n2. A contains an attack (x, x′) with η(x) = u and η(x′) = v or η(x) = v and η(x′) = u.\nFor a subset Q ⊆ ER let R[Q] = (V,ER[Q]) be the directed graph obtained from the reference graph R by reversing all edges in Q, i.e., ER[Q] := { (u, v) | (u, v) ∈ ER \\Q) } ∪ { (v, u) | (u, v) ∈ ER ∩Q }.\nWe also define the abstract argumentation system F [Q] := (X,A[Q]) as the system obtained from F with A[Q] := { (u, v) ∈ A | (η(u), η(v)) /∈ ER[Q]) }.\nNote that the reference graph R is by definition acyclic (in contrast to the value graph GvalF whose definition is similar but distinct).\nEvery specific audience ≤ of F can now be represented by some subset Q ⊆ ER for which the directed graph R[Q] is acyclic, and conversely, every set Q ⊆ ER such that R[Q] is acyclic represents a specific audience ≤. These observations are made precise in the following lemma whose easy proof is omitted.\nLemma 6. An argument x1 is subjectively accepted in F if and only if there exists a set Q ⊆ ER such that R[Q] is acyclic and x1 is in the unique preferred extension of F [Q]. An argument x1 is objectively accepted in F if and only if for every set Q ⊆ ER such that R[Q] is acyclic it holds that x1 is in the unique preferred extension of F [Q].\nSince we can test for acyclicity with MSO logic (see the next subsection), we can now express subjective and objective acceptance in MSO logic as “a certain property holds for some subset Q of ER for which R[Q] is acyclic” and “a certain property holds for all subsets Q of ER for which R[Q] is acyclic”, respectively. Next we give a more detailed description of how to accomplish the two tasks for our proof."

These results establish a sharp boundary between tractability and intractability of persuasive argumentation for valuebased systems with value-width 2.

      "text" : "Proof of Lemma 1. Let C = (x1, z1, . . . , xk, zk, t) be a certifying path for x1 in F . Take a specific audience ≤ such that η(x1) < · · · < η(xk) < η(t) and all other values in V are smaller than η(x1). We claim that the unique preferred extension P = GE(F≤) of F≤ includes {x1, . . . , xk, t} and excludes {z1, . . . , zk}, which means that x1 is subjectively accepted in F . It follows from C5 that t is not attacked by any other argument in F≤ and hence t ∈ P (see also Section 2 for a description of an algorithm to find the unique preferred extension of an acyclic abstract argumentation system). From C4 it follows that zk /∈ P . Furthermore, if there exists an argument z 6= t, η(t) = η(z) then either (t, z) ∈ A≤ or z does not attack an argument in {x1, . . . , xk, t}. In the first case z /∈ P and does not influence the membership in P for any other arguments in X . In the second case z ∈ P but it does not attack any argument in {x1, . . . , xk, t}. In both cases it follows that xk ∈ P . Using C3 it follows that zk−1 /∈ P and since we already know that zk /∈ P it follows that xk−1 ∈ P . A repeated application of the above arguments establishes the claim, and hence x1 ∈ P follows.\nConversely, suppose that there exists a specific audience ≤ such that x1 is contained in the unique preferred extension P = GE(F≤) of F≤. We will now construct a certifying path C for x1 in F . Clearly, if there is no z1 ∈ X \\ {x1} with η(z1) = η(x1) and (z1, x1) ∈ A, then (x1) is a certifying path for x1 in F . Hence, it remains to consider the case where such a z1 exists. Since x1 ∈ P it follows that z1 /∈ P . The sequence (x1, z1) clearly satisfies properties C1–C3. We now show that we can always extend such a sequence until we have found a certifying path for x1 in F . Hence, let S = (x1, z1, . . . , xl, zl) be such a sequence satisfying conditions C1–C3, and in addition assume S satisfies the following two conditions:\nS1 It holds that η(x1) < · · · < η(xl).\nS2 For every 1 ≤ i ≤ l we have xi ∈ P and zi /∈ P .\nClearly, the sequence (x1, z1) satisfies S1 and S2, hence we can include these conditions in our induction hypothesis. It remains to show how to extend S to a certifying path. Let Y := { y ∈ P | (y, zl) ∈ A ∧ η(y) > η(xl) = η(zl) }. Then Y 6= ∅ because zl /∈ P by condition S2 and the assumption that P is a preferred extension.\nFor each y ∈ Y let Cy = (x1, z1, . . . , xl, zl, y). If there is an argument y ∈ Y such that Cy is a certifying path for x1 in F we are done. Hence assume there is no such y ∈ Y .\nWe choose xl+1 ∈ Y arbitrarily. Note that Cxl+1 satisfies the condition C4; (xl+1, zl) ∈ A (as xl+1 ∈ Y ) and (xl+1, xi) /∈ A for 1 ≤ i ≤ l (as xl+1, xi ∈ P and P is conflict-free). Since we assume that Cxl+1 is not a certifying path, Cxl+1 must violate C5.\nIt follows that there exists some argument zl+1 with η(zl+1) = η(xl+1) such that (xl+1, zl+1) /∈ A and (zl+1, xi) ∈ A for some 1 ≤ i ≤ l+1. We conclude that S′ = (x1, z1, . . . , xl, zl, xl+1, zl+1) satisfies conditions C1–C3 and S1–S2. Hence, we are indeed able to extend S and will eventually obtain a certifying path for x1 in F .\nProof of Lemma 2. Assume that x1 is objectively accepted in F . Suppose there is a p ∈ X that attacks x1 and η(p) = η(x1). If we take a specific audience ≤ where η(x1) is the greatest element, then x1 is not in the unique preferred extension of F≤, a contradiction to the assumption that x1 is objectively accepted. Hence η(p) 6= η(x1) for all arguments p ∈ X that attack x1. Next suppose there is an argument p ∈ X that attacks x1 and is subjectively accepted in F − η(x1). Let ≤ be a specific audience such that p is in the unique preferred extension of (F − η(x1))≤. We extend ≤ to a total ordering of V ensuring η(x1) ≤ η(p). Clearly x1 is not in the unique preferred extension of F≤, again a contradiction. Hence indeed for all p ∈ X that attack x1 we have η(p) 6= η(x1) and p is not subjectively accepted in F − η(x1)\nWe establish the reverse direction by proving its counter positive. Assume that x1 is not objectively accepted in F . We show that there exists some p ∈ X that attacks x1 and where either η(p) = η(x1) or p is subjectively accepted in F − η(x1). Let ≤ be a specific audience of F such that x1 is not in the unique preferred extension P = GE(F≤) of F≤. In view of the labeling procedure for finding P as sketched in Section 2, it follows that there exists some p ∈ P that attacks x1 with η(x1) ≤ η(p). If η(x1) = η(p) then we are done. On the other hand, if η(p) 6= η(x1), then p is in the unique preferred extension of (F − η(x1))≤, and so p is subjectively accepted in F − η(x1).\nProof of Corollary 1. We slightly modify the reduction from 3SAT as given in Section 3.2. Let C1, . . . , Cm be the clauses of the 3CNF formula Φ. It is well-known that 3SAT remains NP-hard for formulas where each clause is either positive (all three literals are unnegated variables) or negative (all three literals are negated variables), see [19]. Hence we may assume that for some 2 ≤ k ≤ m, C1, . . . , Ck are positive clauses and Ck+1, . . . , Cm are negative clauses. Let F and F ′ be the two value-based systems corresponding to Φ as constructed in Section 3.2. We obtain from F the value-based system FB by adding a new pair of arguments xB , yB with a new value vB = η(xB) = η(yB) and inserting the pair between the pairs xik, z i k and the pair xk+1, zk+1. That is, for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 we replace the attacks (xk+1, zik) and (zk+1, x i k) with the attacks (xB , z i k) and (zB, x i k), and we add the attacks (xk+1, zB), (zk+1, xB). By the same modification we obtain from F ′ the value-based system F ′B . Clearly Claims 1 and 2 still hold for the modified value-based systems, i.e., Φ is satisfiable if and only if x1 is subjectively accepted in F , and Φ is satisfiable if and only if x1 is not objectively accepted in F ′.\nIn order to establish the corollary it remains to show that the value graphs of FB and F ′B are bipartite. We partition the set of arguments into two sets X0 and X1. X0 contains the values vj for j ≤ k, the value vB , and the values vij for j > k. X1 contains the values vj for j > k, the values v i j for j ≤ k, and the value vt. For F ′B , X1 contains also the value v0. It is easy to check that there is no attack (a, b) with η(a), η(b) ∈ X0 or η(a), η(b) ∈ X1, hence FB and F ′B have bipartite value graphs.\nProof of Lemma 7. Let G′ be the graph obtained from G(S[F, x1]) = (VS[F,x1], ES[F,x1]) by replacing every path of the form (t, (t, h), h) for t, h ∈ V by an edge {t, h}; i.e., G′ = (V ′, E′) where V ′ = X ∪ V and E′ = (ES[F,x1] ∩ { {u, v} | u, v ∈ X ∪ V }) ∪ { {t, h} | (t, h) ∈ ER }. Conversely one can obtain G(S[F, x1]) from G′ by subdividing all edges of the form {t, h} for t, h ∈ V and (t, h) ∈ ER with a vertex (t, h). However, subdividing edges does not change the treewidth of a graph [7], hence it suffices to show that the treewidth of G′ is at most twice the treewidth of the extended graph structure of F plus 1. Let T = (T, χ) be a tree decomposition of the extended graph structure of F . We observe that T ′ = (T, χ′) where χ′(t) = χ(t)∪{ η(v) | v ∈ X∩χ(t) } is a tree decomposition of G′ where |χ′(t)| ≤ 2 · |χ(t)| for all nodes t of T ; hence the width of T ′ is at most twice the width of T plus 1."

A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (J. Logic Comput. 13, 2003), extends Dung’s framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).",
