      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The computing world has changed over the past decade due to the rapid development of internet and new privacy enhancement technologies to circumvent internet censorship. Tor which is popular in fighting internet censorship has been deployed to serve thousands of users transferring terabytes of data daily [1], [2].\nTor is an overlay network designed to provide privacy and anonymity over the internet for TCP based applications like browsing. It operates by anonymising the identity of users connecting through a series of tunnels and nodes. A user browses the web firstly by sending a request anonymously to Tor routers from one of the directory servers [2], [3]. Once a connection is established, traffic is relayed to the first router also called the Entry Guard. A session key is then generated between the client and the Entry Guard using Deffie-Hellman key exchange [4]. The same process is repeated on one router (hop) at a time to extend the circuit each time with established session keys for the previous routers. The last hop called the exit router communicates direct with the destination as a proxy [1]. With the establishment of three routers, the circuit is ready for internet traffic. The design of TOR network which includes the use of three hops and session keys helps to maintain anonymity through a concept called ‘perfect forward secrecy’[2], [5].\nTor networks are created to give internet users their privacy, freedom of speech, illegal tapping traffic and surveillance of network threatening users’ personal identity [6]. Besides Tor network being used for good, greater portion of its traffic are port scans, hacking attempts, exfiltration of stolen data and online criminality [2].\nOver the last decade, Tor traffic classification has advanced in its applications in systems like quality of service (QoS) tools or Security information and Event management (SIEM) [7]. A considerable interest have been attracted from researchers and the industries to the study of these technologies and developing classification techniques [8][7].\nTo this effect intrusion detection system (IDS) plays an important role in Tor networks. Intrusion Detection Systems are placed on the networks to monitor and detect anomalies. In general IDS can be categorised into two components, based on the detection technique. Signature based and Outlier based IDS. Most IDs employ a signature based detection approach where the network traffic is monitored and compared against database rules or signature of known anomaly in network traffic [9][10]. An alarm is raised on detection of a mismatch. Signature based is the most\nARES’17, August 2017, Regio Callabria, ITALY E. Hodo et al.\ncommon as they do not necessarily have to learn the network traffic’s behaviour. Although it is effective in detecting known anomalies, it cannot detect unknown anomalies unless the signature and rules are updated with new signatures [11][12]. Signature based is known to have a significant time lapse between anomaly detection and activation of its corresponding signature [10]. Signature based techniques are mainly human-dependent in creating, testing and deploying signatures.\nThe outlier technique is a behavioural based detection system. It observes changes in normal activity of network traffic and builds a profile of the network traffic being monitored [13][14]. An alarm is raised whenever a deviation from the normal behaviour is detected. It has the ability to detect unknown anomalies. However outlier detection based IDS have the disadvantage of being computational expensive because the profile generated over a period needs to be updated against each system activity [15] [10]. Machine learning techniques have the ability to learn the normal and anomalous patterns automatically by training a dataset to predict an anomaly in network traffic. One important characteristic defining the effectiveness of machine learning techniques is the features extracted from raw data for classification and detection. Features are the important information extracted from raw data. The underlying factor in selecting the best features lies in a trade-off between detection accuracy and false alarm rates. The use of all features on the other hand will lead to a significant overhead and thus reducing the risk of removing important features. Although the importance of feature selection cannot be overlooked, intuitive understanding of the problem is mostly used in the selection of features [16].\nThis paper analyses the performance of Artificial neural network (ANN) and Support vector machines (SVM) in terms of overall accuracy in detecting nonTor traffic in a Tor network traffic dataset data from the University of New Brunswick (UNB), Canadian Institute for cyber security (CIC) using a hybrid anomaly based approach. As part of the work, the results are compared with the results of A.Lashkari et al.[7] being the only study published to the best of our knowledge using the UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset [17]. A. Lashkari et al.[7]extracted 23 time based features from the dataset. A combination algorithm Cfs-SubsetEval + BestFirst (SE+BF) and Infogain+Ranker (IG+RK) was used to reduce the number of features from 23 to 5. The results from the feature selection algorithm was used to test different machine learning algorithms (ZeroR, C4.5 and KNN) using 10 fold cross validation and measured the weighted average precision and recall. Their results showed C4.5 was the best classifier.\nIn the proposed approach 10 features are selected out of the 28 features of the dataset using Correlation based feature selection (CFS) for training and testing the detection algorithms.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows: section 2 describes intrusion detection systems, section 3 describes the UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset, section 4 introduces Artificial neural network and Support vector machines algorithms used in the experiment respectively, section 5 analysis experimental results, conclusion and future works are presented in section VI."

      "text" : "Intrusion detection system is a software application or a device placed at strategic places on a network to monitor and detect anomalies in network traffic [1][2] as shown in Fig. 1. The main features of IDS are to raise an alarm when an anomaly is detected. A complementary approach is to take corrective measures when anomalies are detected, such an approach is referred to as an intrusion Prevention System (IPS) [3]. Based on the interactivity property of IDS, it can be designed to work either on-line or offline. On-line IDS operates on a network in real time by analysing traffic packets and applying rules to classify normal and analogous traffic. Off-line IDS operates by storing data and after processing to classify normal and anomaly."

The UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset contains a total of 28 features listed in table 2.\nThe features were generated by a sequence of packets having the same values for {source IP, source Port, destination port and protocol (TCP and UDP)}. All Tor traffic was TCP since the flow does not support UDP. The generation of flows was done by a new application, the ISCX Flow Meter which generates bidirectional flows [7]."

It is assumed that \uD835\uDC66' is a categorical variable from some infinite set, \uD835\uDC66' ∈ {1…\uD835\uDC36} [4]. The technique used to train the MLP neural network is the Back Propagation hence the name MLP-BP.\nThe construction of the MLP-BP neural network is by putting layers of non-linear elements to form complex hypotheses. Each node takes an element of a feature vector. The structure of the ANN consists of three layers feed-forward neural network as shown in Fig. 2 Nodes labelled \uD835\uDC652 ……\uD835\uDC653 have been used to represent the input feature vectors to the ANN. Hidden inner nodes \uD835\uDC4E2 ……\uD835\uDC4E3 make up the hidden layer with an output layer of \uD835\uDC662 \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC51 \uD835\uDC667 nodes denoting different output classes (Tor and NonTor). The interconnection between the nodes is associated with scalar weights with an initial weight assigned to the connection. During training, the weights are adjusted.\nEvaluating the hypotheses is done by setting the input modes in a feed-back process and the values are propagated through the network to the output. At this stage the gradient descent is used so as to push the error in the output node back through the network by a back propagation process in order to estimate the error in the hidden nodes. The gradient of the cost – function is then calculated [5]."

      "text" : "This paper proposes correlation based feature selection (CFS) to select the relevant features out of the 28 features. CFS is a filtering algorithm using a correlation based heuristic evaluation function to rank feature subsets. A good set of features are highly correlated with the class (target) and at the same time uncorrelated to each other. Redundant features are ignored because they have low correlation with class and will turn to highly correlated with one or more of the remaining features. A feature is accepted based on the extent it predicts classes in areas of the instance space which has not been predicted by other features. Equation (8) shows the CFS feature subset evaluation function. \uD835\uDC40V = MWXY\nMSM MZ2 WYY (5)\nWhere \uD835\uDC40V is heuristic “merit” of a feature subset \uD835\uDC60 containing \uD835\uDC58 features, \uD835\uDC5F\\] is the average feature class correlation. The numerator can be thought of as giving an indication of how predictive a group of features are; the denominator of how much redundancy there is among the features [8]. The CFS algorithm reduces the dimensionality of the dataset, reduces overfitting and gives a shorter training time. Table IV shows the 10 selected features based on the appropriate correlation measure and heuristic search strategy.

    "abstractText" : "Intrusion detection has attracted a considerable interest from researchers and industries. After many years of research the community still faces the problem of building reliable and efficient intrusion detection systems (IDS) capable of handling large quantities of data with changing patterns in real time situations. The Tor network is popular in providing privacy and security to end user by anonymising the identity of internet users connecting through a series of tunnels and nodes. This work focuses on the classification of Tor traffic and nonTor traffic to expose the activities within Tor traffic that minimizes the protection of users. A study to compare the reliability and efficiency of Artificial Neural Network and Support vector machine in detecting nonTor traffic in UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset is presented in this paper. The results are analysed based on the overall accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate of the two algorithms. Experimental results show that both algorithms could detect nonTor traffic in the dataset. A hybrid Artificial neural network proved a better classifier than SVM in detecting nonTor traffic in UNB-CIC Tor Network Traffic dataset.",
