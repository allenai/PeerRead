      "text" : "Many computer vision models are developped with a specific image classification task in mind, adapted to a particular representation such as the bag-of-words (BoW) model or low-level local features (Sivic & Zisserman, 2003; van Gemert et al., 2010). In these representations, all the image information is used to take the decision, even in the spatial BoW extension of Lazebnik et al. (Lazebnik et al., 2006).\nHowever, as pointed out in recent work, humans do not need to consider the entire image to be able to interpret it (Sharma et al., 2012). On the contrary, humans are able to rapidly pick out the important regions of an image necessary to interpret it. This fact suggests that concentrating on specific subset of image regions in an intelligent manner should be sufficient to properly classify an image. In addition to simply selecting regions of an image, our system\nFigure 1. Illustration of our classification framework for two test images (first and second line): According to the content of the center region, the next region to visit is selected (red arrow). Again, depending on the two first regions’ contents, a third one is selected, and so on. After B iterations, the final classification is achieved. As the first region is the same on both images, the second region explored is the same, but as these new regions’ contents differs, the next regions considered by the algorithm are different.\ncan actively decide to consider certain regions of an image in more detail by increasing the BoW resolution for specific sub-regions of an image. This allows the system to adaptively use more or less resources when classifying images of varying complexity. Similar performance-oriented goals have been recently put forward by Karayev et al. (Karayev et al., 2012).\nImportantly, this process is instance-specific, allowing the algorithm to adapt the choice of regions for each processed image. We are able to learn such a model by leveraging the datum-Wise classification framework (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2012a), which is able to learn adaptive classification policies using reinforcement learning (RL). We show that during inference, a significant speed-up is obtained by only computing the local features on the selected regions, while preserving acceptable inference accuracy w.r.t. fullinformation models.

      "heading" : "2. Background",
      "text" : "The standard image classification pipeline follows three steps (Boureau et al., 2010) — (i) low-level local descriptor extraction, (ii) coding, and (iii) pooling — to get feature vectors that are then used for classification. This strategy was definitively popularized in computer vision with the bag-of-words formalism using SIFT local features (Sivic & Zisserman, 2003). Alternatives to the standard coding scheme have been proposed, such as local soft coding (Liu et al., 2011) or sparse coding (Boureau et al., 2010). After the coding phase, most traditional BoW approaches use sum pooling or max pooling. The spatial pyramid matching (SPM) strategy (Lazebnik et al., 2006) extends the pooling by considering a fixed predetermined spatial image pyramid. Many feature detectors have been proposed to get salient areas, affine regions, and points of interest (Mikolajczyk & Schmid, 2005) on images. However, in contrast to the task of matching a specific target image or object, methods for category classification show better performance when using a uniform feature sampling over a dense grid on the image (Chatfield et al., 2011). Other approaches studying are motivated by human eye fixation or salient object detection (Borji et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2011). Recently, several approaches combine dense sampling and saliency map or spatial weighting to obtain powerful image representations (Su & Jurie, 2012; Feng et al., 2011). Sharma et al. (Sharma et al., 2012) proposes a scheme to learn discriminative saliency maps at an image region level. They use the SPM scheme and apply weights to each block of the pyramid to get a global saliency map. In the case of multiclass classification, the weights are learned for each class in a discriminative way using one-against-all binary classification, and the final decision depends on the image content using a latent SVM representation. Other methods based on latent SVM formulation also attempt to jointly encode spatial and content information in image classification. Parizi et al. (Parizi et al., 2012) introduce a reconfigurable model where each region is equiped with a latent variable representing a topic, such that only regions with similar topics are matched together in the final representation. This model provides a flexible framework, overcoming the shortcoming of the fixed spatial grid used in SPM. In all these approaches, the whole image has to be processed and all the information is used to classify, even if some regions of the image contain some misleading or irrelevant contents. We propose a strategy to overcome these limitations: we avoid processing the whole image by focusing only on the most pertinent regions relative to the image classification task. In a way more drastic than Sharma’s approach (Sharma et al., 2012), we constrain our system to take a decision by considering only a fixed number of regions of the test image, thus allowing the computation of the local features to be significantly reduced. The most important aspect of our method is the region selection model. In short, our model is effectively a learned sequential decision policy that sequentially chooses the best region to visit given a set of previously visited regions. Both the locality and actual contents of a region are used in a joint manner to represent the set of visited regions. Inspired by reinforcement learning algorithms, we propose a dedicated algorithm to learn the region selection policy used in our image classification task. More recent work uses similar techniques to find optimal orders for anytime object detection tasks (Karayev et al., 2012). Similar work has been presented that uses a foveal glimpse simulation, but the learning approach is quite different (Larochelle & Hinton, 2010). Sequential learning techniques have been recently applied to different standard classification tasks. In (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2012b), the authors propose to use leinforcement learning models for learning sparse classifiers on vectors, (Busa-Fekete et al., 2012) use sequential techniques for learning a cascade of classifiers depending on the content of the inputs, while (Dulac-Arnold et al., 2011) is an application of sequential learning models to text classification. Finally, (Rückstieß et al.) propose a generic model able to minimize the data consumption with sequential online feature selection. If our approach shares some common ideas with these recent works, we propose an original method that has been developed to handle the specific problem of classifying images using a small set of regions and a new learning algorithm which is efficient both in term of speed and performance. To summarize, the contributions presented in this paper are as follows: • We propose a sequential model that, given an image, first selects a subset of relevant regions in this image, and then classifies it. The advantages of such a method are: (i) The classification decision is based only on the features of the acquired regions, resulting in a speedup of the classification algorithm during inference. (ii) The algorithm is able to ignore misleading or irrelevant regions. (iii) The way regions are selected de-\n220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273\n275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329\npends both on the position but also on the content of the regions, resulting in a model able to adapt its behavior to the content of each image being classified. (iv) At last, the model is a multiclass model and the regions selection policy is learned globally for all the classes while other existing methods usually apply a category-specific region selection scheme. • We propose a new learning algorithm inspired from reinforcement learning techniques adapted to the particular problem faced here. • We present an experimental evaluation of this method on three different classical datasets and propose a qualitative study explaining the behaviour of this model."

S(x) denotes the set of all possible trajectories over image x and St(x) the trajectories composed of t selected regions. Given a fixed budget B, new regions are acquired resulting in a trajectory of size B. Given this trajectory, the classifier then decides which category to assign to the image. There are two important aspects of our approach: First, the way 1We consider in this paper the case of monolabel classification where one input is associated to exactly one possible category. 2Note that all the images have the same N ×M number of regions.\nFigure 2.

Section 3.2.3 — resulting in a classifier that is able to adapt its representation to each image being classified, thus selecting the best regions for each image. Second, the final decision is made given the features of the acquired regions only, without needing the computation of the features for the other regions, thus resulting in both a speed-up of the classification process — not all features have to be computed — but also, for some cases as described in Section 5, in an improvement of the classification rate due to the exclusion of noisy regions. We now give details concerning the features, the classification phase — which classifies the image given the B previously selected regions — and the exploration phase — which selects B − 1 additional regions3 over an image to classify."

The complete learning algorithm is given in Algorithm 2 and provides the general idea behind our method. At each iteration of the algorithm, a set of learning states is sampled from the training images using a uniform random distribution. For each sampled state, the previously learned sub-policies are then used to simulate – using Monte Carlo techniques – the behavior of the algorithm and thus to provide supervision to the sub-policy we are learning. The detailed process is given in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.

The underlying idea is to automatically learn from the training set a classifier which is optimal for classifying any subset of B regions for any input image. The classification policy fθ is learned on a large training set of images which have had B regions uniformly sampled — lines 5 and 6 of Alg. 3 — over the training images. Each set of regions is transformed to a feature vector using the Φ function and provided to the learning algorithm using the label of the image as the supervision.

As explained in the next section, the goal of learning the exploration policy is to improve the quality of fθ by finding a good representation instead of using a uniform sampling approach.

Given a new image x, using only fθ applied to a uniformly sampled set of regions has one main drawback: for some sampled sets, fθ will certainly predict the right classification label, but for other samples, it will make a classification error, particularly for samples that contain irrelevant or misleading regions. The goal of the exploration policy π is thus to provide fθ with a set of good regions i.e. a set of regions on which the classification function will predict the correct category. In other words, π aims at reducing the error rate\nFigure 3. Illustration of the learning algorithm for πγB−1 . On a sample (sx1 , ...sxB−1) of B − 1 regions, all remaining regions sxB are considered and classified by fθ (left) (simulation step, lines 6-8 of Algorithm 4). For some regions – the first one here – fθ computes the right label, for other regions fθ makes a prediction error (line 9 of Alg. 4). The regions on which fθ provides the good label are considered as training examples for learning πγB−1 (line 10).\nof fθ by changing the way regions are sampled. The complete learning method is given in Algorithm 4. Given this principle, the idea of how to learn π is as follows: consider the case where fθ has been learned and we are currently learning πγB−1 i.e. the sub-policy that aims at acquiring the B-th and final region. Given any sample of B − 1 regions (sx1 , ...sxB−1), πγB−1 can decide to acquire any of the remaining regions. If it acquires some of these regions, the classification policy will predict the right category while, for some other regions, fθ will predict the incorrect category as illustrated in Fig. 3. The method we propose consists thus in simulating the decision of fθ over all the possible B-th regions that can be acquired by πγB−1 , and to use the regions that correspond to a good final classification decision as supervised examples for learning πγB−1 . The result of this learning is to obtain a sub-policy that tends to select regions for which fθ will be able to properly predict. The same type of reasoning can be also used for learning the other policies i.e. πγB−2 will be learned in order to improve the quality of the sub-policy (πγB−1 , fθ), πγB−3 will be learned in order to improve the quality of the subpolicy (πγB−2 , πγB−1 , fθ) and so on.

Let us denote ` the number of training images and k the number of sample built for each image, at each step of the learning.

Let us detail the experimental setup by presenting the low-level image features and the chosen vectorial representation for each region. We densely extract gray SIFT descriptors using the VLFEAT library (Vedaldi & Fulkerson, 2010). These local features are computed at a single scale (s = 16 pixels) and with a constant step size d. For 15-scenes we use d = 8 pixels while d = 4 pixels for PPMI. Each region is represented by a BoW vector generated from SIFT descriptors (Sivic & Zisserman, 2003). We run a K-Means algorithm by randomly sampling about 1 million descriptors in each database to produce a dictionnary of M = 200 codeword elements. Each SIFT is then projected on the dictionary using hard assignement, and the codes are aggregated with sum pooling. The histogram is further `2 normalized. Finally, we take the square root of each element thus generating a Bahttacharyya kernel feature map. The standard learning algorithm for fθ and πγ is a oneagainst-all hinge-loss perceptron learned with a gradient descent algorithm. The gradient descent step and number of iterations have been tuned over the training set in order to maximize the accuracy of the classifier. We have chosen to create 10 sequences of regions for each training images, resulting in a training set of size 10 × ` for each classifier – fθ and πγt – learned by our method. Performance with more samples has been computed but is not reported here since it is equivalent to the one obtained with 10 samples per image."

      "text" : "In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we use the standard metrics for the two considered databases: multi-class accuracy for 15-scenes, and average accuracy over the 12 independently learned binary tasks for PPMI6. We randomly sample training/testing images on 5 splits of the data, and the final performance corresponds to the average performance obtained on the 5 runs. We run experiments with different values of B. The baseline model performance is the one obtained where B = 16 i.e. all the regions are acquired by the model and the classification decision is based on the whole image. The results obtained with such a baseline approach are on par with previously published state-of-the art performances with a similar setup. For example, we reach 77.7% accuracy in the 15-Scene database, exactly matching the performances reported in (Parizi et al., 2012) 7. Although absolute per6Note that we do not report MAP metrics for PPMI, since our model produces a category label but not a score for each image. 7Their SBoW method matches our pipeline: mono-scale SIFT extracted with the same step size, same dictionary size, same coding/pooling schemes on a 4× 4 grid, and normalization policy.\n660 661 662 663 664 665 666 667 668 669 670 671 672 673 674 675 676 677 678 679 680 681 682 683 684 685 686 687 688 689 690 691 692 693 694 695 696 697 698 699 700 701 702 703 704 705 706 707 708 709 710 711 712 713\n715 716 717 718 719 720 721 722 723 724 725 726 727 728 729 730 731 732 733 734 735 736 737 738 739 740 741 742 743 744 745 746 747 748 749 750 751 752 753 754 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767 768 769\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 % of regions 0.50 0.55 0.60 0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 a cc u ra cy Learned Random Guitar\nFigure 4. Accuracy on the Guitar dataset from PPMI with varying values of B.\nformance can still be improved using more advanced lowlevel feature extraction or mid-level feature embedding, our main purpose here is to validate the relative performance advantage of the proposed method. Figures 5 and 6 show the accuracy obtained for the the PPMI dataset and the 15 Scenes dataset. These figures present two measures: the performance obtained using a uniformly sampled subset of B regions using fθ — in red —, and the performance when the regions are sampled following the learned exploration policy πγ — in blue. Performance on a small set of regions vs performance of the baseline model: When comparing the accuracy of our method with B < 16 to the performance of the baseline method (B = 16), one can see that given a reasonable value of B, our model is competitive with the classical approach. For example, acquiring B = 10 for the 15 Scenes dataset and for B = 8 for the PPMI dataset allows one to obtain accuracy which is similar to the model withB = 16. This means that our method is able to classify as well as standard approach using only half of the regions. Moreover, on PPMI, for B = 8, 10 and 12, our model clearly outperforms the baseline. This illustrates the ability of the learning algorithm to focus on relevant areas of the image, ignoring noisy or misleading regions. The generalization capacity of the prediction is thus improved. Learned exploration policy vs random exploration policy: Now, when comparing the performance of random exploration policy w.r.t. learned exploration policy, one can see that in almost all cases, the learned version is equivalent or better than the random one. For example, on the PPMI corpus with B = 8, learning how to acquire the regions allow one to obtain an improvement of about 4% in term of accuracy. This shows that our model is able, particularly on the PPMI dataset, to discover relevant regions depending on their content. This improvement is less important\n60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 76 78 80 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 A cc u ra cy B Random Exploration Policy Learned Exploration Policy\nFigure 5. Mean accuracy on the PPMI dataset depending on the budget, B. We can see that the learned exploration policy (in red) has a better average accuracy for almost all budgets, especially when considering 8-12 regions.\nwhen the number of acquired regions is large. This is due to the fact that, when acquiring for example B = 12 regions, even at random, the relevant information has a high chance of being acquired. The same effect also happens when B is low e.g. when B = 2, the information acquired is not sufficient to allow for good classification. This shows that our method is particularly interesting when the number of acquired regions is between about 30% and 60% of the overall image. On certain specific datasets performance gains with our method can be quit important. Performance for varying values of B for the Guitar dataset of PPMI is illustrated in Figure 4, where we can see that as the percentage of regions acquired decreases (decreasing B), the random exploration policy’s performance degrades quickly whereas our method is able to maintain adequate performance, until B becomes too small. The difference in performance between PPMI and 15 Scenes is likely linked to the fact that detecting instrument play in an image requires specific regions to be available (the face and the flute for example), whereas the scene can be inferred from a wider array of regions. Complexity Analysis: Let us denote C the cost of computing the features over a region of the image, and F the cost of computing fθ or πγi . The final inference complexity is O(B(C + F )). As we use linear classifiers in all our experiments, classification time is insignificant in comparison to SIFT computation (F << C), and complexity is therefore reduced to O(BC). In comparison to the cost of a classical BoW model O(NMB), the proposed model thus results in a speed-up of N×MB .

Trajectories computed on PPMI-Flute (test). Each node corresponds to a region — label is (x, y)-coordinates. Each edge i → j means that j has been acquired just after having acquired i. The color of the edge represents the proportion of infered trajectories that contain the i→ j transition.\nPPMI dataset. Figure 7 summarizes the regions visited over the testing images. Each region corresponds to a node of the graph, and an edge from region i to region j means that in at least one testing image, regions j has been acquired immediately after region i. We can see that the algorithm is focusing its attention around 5 regions that are certainly relevant for many pictures, i.e. (1; 3), (4; 2), (4; 3), (3; 3) and (3; 1). On the other hand, Figure 7 shows that at the beginning the algorithm tends to explore many different regions after the initial region. This shows that the the model starts by first exploring the image — until having acquired 2 regions — before focusing its attention on the regions that are the most relevant for predicting the category. Figure 8 shows the average behavior of our algorithm for B = 4 and B = 8.We notice that about half of the acquired regions — 2 for B = 4 and 4 for B = 8 — are much more frequently explored than the other regions. These regions certainly correspond to regions that generally carry relevant information on all the images.\nFigure 8. Most frequent acquired regions for B = 4 (left) and B = 8 (right) on the PPMI Flute Dataset. The darker, the more frequent the region has been acquired for classifying.\nFigure 9. Two examples of regions acquired with B = 4 on the PPMI-Flute dataset. This example shows the ability of the model to adapt to different images where it is able to discover a flute.\nThe images in Figure 8 can be interpreted as a spatial “prior” for a specific classification task. For example, for discriminating playing v.s. holding flute with B = 2, regions (3; 2) and (3; 1) are the more informative on average. However, since the decision is instance-based in our method, this spatial prior is balanced with the specific visual content of each test image. Our approach therefore shares some similarities with the reconfigurable model of (Parizi et al., 2012) using latent SVM. One example of instance-based classification is illustrated in figure 9, where the regions visited with B = 4 are shown. We can see that the set of regions visited changes between the left and right image. This illustrates the ability of our method to automatically adapt its choice of representation to the content of the image it is classifying."

Our strategy is based on a sequential process that learns to explore the different regions of any image in order to infer its category. In particular, the choice of regions is specific to each image, directed by the actual content of previously selected regions.The capacity of the system to handle incomplete image information as well as its adaptive region selection allow the system to perform well in budgeted classification tasks by exploiting a dynamicly generated representation of each image. We demonstrate the system’s abilities in a series of image-based exploration and classification tasks that highlight its learned exploration and inference abilities.",
