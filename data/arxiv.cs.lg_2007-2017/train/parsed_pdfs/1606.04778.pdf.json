      "text" : "1 The Learning and Prediction of Application-level Traffic Data in Cellular Networks\nRongpeng Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Jianchao Zheng, Yan Chen, Chengli Mei, Yueming Cai, and Honggang Zhang\nAbstract—Traffic learning and prediction is at the heart of the evaluation of the performance of telecommunications networks and attracts a lot of attention in wired broadband networks. Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards, with the aid of the traffic “big data”, we make a comprehensive study over the modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical modeling characteristics, including α-stable modeled property in the temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.\nIndex Terms—Big data, cellular networks, traffic prediction, αstable models, dictionary learning, alternative direction method, sparse signal recovery.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTraffic learning prediction in cellular networks, which is a classical yet still appealing field, yields a significant number of meaningful results. From a macroscopic perspective, it provides the commonly believed result that mobile Internet will witness a 1000-folded traffic growth in the next 10 years [1], which is acting as a crucial anchor for the design of next-generation cellular network architecture and embedded algorithms. On the other hand, the fine traffic prediction on a daily, hourly or even minutely basis could contribute to the optimization and management of cellular networks like energy savings [2], opportunistic scheduling [3], and network anomaly detection [4] . In other words, a precisely predicted future traffic load knowledge, which contributes to improving the\nR. Li and Y. Chen are with Huawei Technologies Co.

For example, it is inevitable to precisely forecast the traffic in one single cell, so as to turn some base stations (BSs) into sleeping mode when the traffic demand becomes low. Moreover, there comes a trend to enhance the edge functionalities of cellular networks, by deploying more resources in edge nodes (e.g., BSs). Hence, it is also meaningful to learn the traffic characteristics in one single cell.\nOur previous research [7] has demonstrated the microscopic traffic predictability in cellular networks for circuit switching’s voice and short message service and packet switching’s data service. However, compared to the more accurate prediction performance for voice and text service in circuit switching domain, the state-of-the-art research in packet switching’s data service is still not satisfactory enough. Therefore, a learning and prediction study over application-level data traffic might contribute to understanding data service’s traffic characteristics, thus potentially leading to better prediction performance. Consequently, in this paper, we focus on the analyses for application-level traffic generated by three popular service types (i.e., instantaneous message (IM), web browsing, video). In order to obtain general results, we firstly collect a significant amount of practical traffic records from China Mobile1. By taking advantage of the traffic “big data”, we then confirm the preciseness of fitting α-stable models to these typical service types of traffic and demonstrate α-stable models’ universal existence in cellular network traffic. We later show that αstable models can be used to leverage the temporally long range dependence, and guide linear algorithms to conduct traffic prediction. Besides, we find that spatial sparsity is also applicable for the application-level traffic, and propose that the predicted traffic should be able to be mapped to some sparse signals. In this regard, benefiting from the latest progress in compressive sensing [8]–[11], we could calibrate the traffic prediction results on the condition of not knowing the transform matrix a priori. Finally, in order to forecast the traffic with the aforementioned characteristics, we formulate the prediction problem by a new framework and then develop a dictionary learning based alternating direction method (ADM) [11] to solve it.\n1It is worthwhile to note here that we also collect another dataset from China Telecom to further verify the effectiveness of the thoughts inside in this paper.

      "text" : "Due to its apparent significance, there have already existed two research streams toward the fine traffic prediction issue in wired broadband networks and cellular networks [7]. One is based on fitting models (e.g., ON-OFF model [12], ARIMA model [13], FARIMA model [14] , mobility model [15], [16], network traffic model [16], and α-stable model [17], [18]) to explore the traffic characteristics, such as spatial and temporal relevancies [19] or self-similarity [20], [21], and obtain the future traffic by appropriate prediction methods. The other is based on modern signal processing techniques (e.g., principal components analysis method [22], [23], Kalman filtering method [23], [24] or compressive sensing method [2], [11], [22], [25]) to capture the evolution of traffic. Meanwhile, it is useful to firstly model large-scale traffic vectors as sparse linear combinations of basis elements. Therefore, some dictionary learning method [26] is necessary to learn and construct the basis sets or dictionaries.\nHowever, the existing traffic prediction methods in this microscopic case still lag behind the diverse requirements of various application scenarios. Firstly, most of them still focus on the traffic of all data services [27], and seldom shed light on a specific type of services (e.g., video, web browsing, IM, etc). Secondly, the existing prediction methods usually follow the analysis results in wired broadband networks like the α-stable models2 [28], [29] or the often accompanied self-similarity [20] to forecast future traffic values [14], [18], [21]. However, since cellular networks have more stringent constraints on radio resources [30], relatively expensive billing polices and different user behaviors due to mobility [31] and thus exhibit distinct traffic characteristics, the corresponding results need to be validated before being directly applied to cellular networks [7]."

      "text" : "Following the generalized central limit theorem, α-stable models manifest themselves in the capability to approximate the distribution of normalized sums of a relatively large number of independent identically distributed random variables [32] and lead to the accumulative property. Besides, α-stable models produce strong bursty results with properties of heavy tailed distributions and long range dependence. Therefore, they arise in a natural way to characterize the traffic in wired broadband networks [33], [34] and have been exploited in resource management analyses [35], [36]. α-stable models, with few exceptions, lack a closed-form expression of the probability density function (PDF), and are generally specified by their characteristic functions. Definition 1. A random variable T is said to obey α-stable models if there are parameters 0 < α ≤ 2, σ ≥ 0, −1 ≤ β ≤\n3\n1, and µ ∈ R such that its characteristic function is of the following form:\nΦ(ω) = E(exp jωT )\n=  exp { −σα|ω|α ( 1− jβ(sgn(ω)) tan πα 2 ) + jµω } , α 6= 1; exp { −σ|ω| ( 1 + j 2β\nπ (sgn(ω)) ln |ω|\n) + jµω } , α = 1.\n(1) Here, the function E(·) represents the expectation operation with respect to a random variable. α is called the characteristic exponent and indicates the index of stability, while β is identified as the skewness parameter. α and β together determine the shape of the models. Moreover, σ and µ are called scale and shift parameters, respectively. In particular, if α = 2, α-Stable models reduce to Gaussian distributions.\nFurthermore, for an α-stable modeled random variable T , there exists a linear relationship between the parameter α and the function Ψ(ω) = ln {−Re [ln (Φ(ω))]} as\nΨ(ω) = ln {−Re [ln (Φ(ω))]} = α ln(ω) + α ln(σ), (2)\nwhere the function Re(·) calculates the real part of the input variable.\nUsually, it’s challenging to prove whether a dataset follows a specific distribution, especially for α-stable models without a closed-form expression for the PDF. Therefore, when a dataset is said to satisfy α-stable models, it usually means the dataset is consistent with the hypothetical distribution and the corresponding properties. In other words, the validation needs to firstly estimate parameters of α-stable models from the given dataset, and then compare the real distribution of the dataset with the estimated α-stable model [34]. Specifically, the corresponding parameters in α-stable models can be determined by maximum likelihood methods, quantile methods, or sample characteristic function methods [33], [34]."

On the other hand, orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) [38] greedily achieves the final outcome in a sequential manner, by computing inner products between the signal and dictionary columns, and possibly solving them using the least square criterion.\nFor sparsity methods above, there usually exists an assumption that the transform matrix or dictionary D is already known or fixed. However, in spite of their computation simplicity, such pre-specified transform matrices like Fourier transforms and overcomplete wavelets might not be suitable to lead to a sparse signal [39]. Consequently, some researchers proposed to design D based on learning [26], [39]. In other words, during the sparse signal recovery procedure, machine learning and statistics are leveraged to compute the vectors in D from the measurement vector y, so as to grant more flexibility to get a sparse representation s from y. Mathematically, dictionary learning methods would yield a final transform matrix by alternating between a sparse computation process based on the current dictionary and a dictionary update process to approach the measurement vector."

      "text" : "In this paper, our datasets are based on a significant number of practical traffic records from China Mobile in Hangzhou, an eastern provincial capital in China via the Gb interface of 2G/3G cellular networks or S1 interface of 4G cellular networks [40]. Specifically, these records are concerned with the packets from the Layer 7 (i.e., Application Layer) of OSI model. Specifically, the datasets encompass\n4 nearly 6000 cells’ location records3 with more than 7 million subscribers involved. The datasets also contain the information like timestamp, corresponding cell ID, and trafficrelated application name, by taking advantage of matching traffic records with specific protocols. In particular, we can determine web browsing service and video service by the applied HTTP protocol and streaming protocol respectively, while we assume traffic records to belong to the IM service, after fitting them to learning results of regular IM packet pattern. Moreover, the traffic volume could be calculated after aggregating packets to each influx base station. Notably, the paper aims to predict the traffic volume in each BS instead of the entire cellular network.\nAccording to the traffic resolution (e.g., the traffic collection interval, namely 5 minutes and 30 minutes), the collected data can be sorted into two categories. Table I summarizes the information of per 5-minute traffic records collected on September 9th, 2014 with Weixin/Wechat4, HTTP Web Browsing, and QQLive Video5 selected as the representatives of these three service types. Here, the term “no. of active cells” refers to the number of cells where a specific type of service happened. Similarly, Table II lists the corresponding details of per 30- minute traffic records from July 14th, 2014 to July 27th, 2014 with QQ6, HTTP Web Browsing, and QQLive Video as the representatives, respectively.\nBased on the datasets in Table I and Table II, Fig. 2 illustrates the traffic variations generated by these applications in the randomly selected cells. Indeed, the phenomena in Fig. 2 universally exist in other individual cells and lead to the following insight.\nRemark 1. Different services exhibit distinct traffic characteristics. IM and HTTP web browsing services frequently produce traffic loads; while distinct from them, video service with more sporadic activities may generate more significant traffic loads.\nFor simplicity of representation, we introduce a traffic vector x, whose entries archives the volume of traffic in one given cell at different moments. Furthermore, by augmenting the traffic vectors for different cells, we refer to a traffic matrix X to denote the traffic records in an area of interest. Then, every row vector of traffic matrix indicates traffic loads at one specific cell with respect to the time while every column vector reflects volumes of traffic of several adjacent cells at one specific moment. Specifically, for a traffic resolution ∆t, X(i, t) in a traffic matrix X denotes traffic loads of cell i from t to t+ ∆t.\n3Indeed, at one specific location, there might exist several cells operating on different frequencies or modes. For simplicity of representation, in the following analyses, we merge the information for different cells at the same location into one.\n4Weixin/Wechat provides a Whatsapp-alike instant messaging service developed by Tencent Inc., and is one of the most popular mobile social applications in China with more than 400 million active users.\n5QQLive Video is a popular live streaming video platform in China. 6QQ is another instant messaging service developed by Tencent Inc. with more than 800 million active users.

Firstly, in Table III and Table IV , we list the parameter fitting results using quantile methods [41], when we take into consideration the traffic records in three randomly selected cells (each for one service type) of Table I and Table II.\nAfterwards, we use the α-stable models, produced by the aforementioned estimated parameters, to generate some random variable, and compare the induced cumulative distribution function (CDF) with the exact (empirical) one.

Recalling the statements in Section II-A, if the simulated dataset has the same or approximately same distribution as the real one, the empirical dataset could be deemed as α-stable modeled. Therefore, Fig. 3 indicates the traffic records in these selected areas could be simulated by α-stable models.\nOn the other hand, recalling the statements in Section II, for an α-stable modeled random variable X , there exists a linear relationship between the parameter α and the function Ψ(ω) = ln {−Re [ln (Φ(ω))]}. Thus, we fit the estimated parameter α with the computing function Ψ(ω), and provide the preciseness error CDF for all the cells in Fig. 4. According to Fig. 4, the normalized fitting errors for 80% cells in both datasets are less than 0.02. Therefore, the practical applicationlevel traffic records follow the property of α-stable models (in Eq. (2)), and further enhance the validation results by Fig. 3. Meanwhile, different application-level traffic exhibits different fitting accuracy. In that regard, the video traffic in Fig. 4(c) has the minimal fitting error, while the fitting error of the web browsing traffic in Fig. 4(b) is largest. Moreover, since a larger traffic resolution means a confluence of more application-level traffic packets and could better demonstrate the accumulative property of α-stable models, the fitting error quickly decreases along with the increase in traffic resolution.\nRemark 3. Due to their generality, α-stable models are suitable to characterize the application-level traffic loads in cellular networks, even though it might not be the most accurate one.\nIndeed, the universal existence of α-stable models also implies the self-similarity of application-level traffic [20]. Hence, in the following sections, it is sufficient to only present and discuss the results from Dataset 1 in Table I. On the other hand, the phenomena that application-level traffic universally obeys α-stable models can be explained as follows. Our previous study [42] unveiled that the message length of one individual IM activity follows a power-law distribution. Meanwhile, the traffic distribution within one cell can be regarded as the\n0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1 (a) IM\nNormalized Fitting Error\nC D\nF\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1 (b) Web Browsing\nNormalized Fitting Error\nC D\nF\n0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1 (c) Video\nNormalized Fitting Error\nC D\nF\nDataset 1\nDataset 2\nFig. 4.

Moreover, according to the generalized central limit theorem [43], the sum of a number of random variables with power-law distributions decreasing as |x|−α−1 where 0 < α < 2 (and therefore having infinite variance) will tend to an α-stable model as the number of summands grows. Hence, the application-level traffic within one cell follows α-stable models.\nAdditionally, data traffic in wired broadband networks [22] and voice and text traffic in circuit switching domain of cellular networks [2] prove to possess the spatio-temporal sparsity characteristic. Indeed, the application-level traffic spatially possesses this sparse property as well. Fig. 5 depicts the traffic density in 10AM and 4PM in randomly selected dense urban areas. As Fig. 5 shows, there appear a limited number of traffic hotspots. But these hotspots are closed and correlated with each other. Comparatively, there exists a larger area with less traffic. This spatially clustering property is also consistent with the findings in [19], and proves the traffic’s spatial sparsity. Moreover, the number of hotspots for video service is smallest, which indicates QQLive Video traffic has the strongest sparsity.\nRemark 4. The application-level traffic dataset further validates that the traffic for different service types of applications follows a spatially sparse property. Besides, compared to IM and web browsing service, video service exhibits the strongest sparsity."

As Section III-B states, the application-level traffic loads follow α-stable models. Therefore, benefiting from the substantial body of works towards α-stable model based linear prediction [28], [34], coarse prediction results can be achieved by computing linear prediction coefficients in terms of the least mean square error criterion, the minimum dispersion criterion, or the covariation orthogonal criterion [17]. Due to its simplicity and comparatively low variability, the covariation orthogonal criterion [17], [18] is chosen in this paper to demonstrate the α-stable based linear prediction performance.

Moreover, the exact representation of the dictionary, which the previous sparsity analyses do not mention, remains a problem and would be solved later.\nTherefore, it is natural to consider the original dataset as a mixture of these effects and propose a new framework to combine these two components together to get a superior forecasting performance.\nIn order to capture the temporal α-stable modeled variations while keeping the spatial sparsity, a new framework is proposed as follows:\nmin x̂p,x̂α,z,D,s\n‖x̂α − x̃α‖22 + λ1‖z‖22 + λ2‖x̂p −Ds‖22,\ns.t. x̂p = x̂α + z, (11) ‖s‖0 ≤ .\nDue to the nonconvexity of l0-norm, the constraints in Eq. (11) are not directly tractable. Thanks to the sparsity methods discussed in Section II-B, an l1-norm relaxation is employed to make the problem convex while still preserving the sparsity property [44]. Therefore, Eq. (11) can be reformulated as\nmin x̂p,x̂α,z,D,s\n‖x̂α − x̃α‖22 + λ1‖z‖22 + λ2‖x̂p −Ds‖22,\ns.t. x̂p = x̂α + z, (12) ‖s‖1 ≤ ε.\nwhere ε is a predefined constraint, similar to .\nRemark 5. This proposed framework integrates the temporal modeling and spatial correlation together. Moreover, by adjusting λ1 and λ2 to some extreme values, it’s easy to show that the framework in Eq. (12) is closely tied to some typical methods in other references.\n• If λ1 and λ2 are extremely small, the framework is simplified to a simple α-stable linear prediction method [17], [18]. • If λ2 is extremely large, the spatial sparsity factor dominates in the framework [22]."

      "text" : "In order to optimize the generalized framework in Eq. (12), we first reformulate Eq. (12) by taking advantage of the augmented Lagrangian function [45] and then develop an alternating direction method (ADM) [11] to solve it. Specifically, the corresponding augmented Lagrangian function can be formulated as\nL(x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) , ‖x̂α − x̃α‖22 + λ1‖z‖22 + λ2‖x̂p −Ds‖22\n+〈m, x̂p − x̂α − z〉 (13) +γ · ‖s‖1 (14) +η · ‖x̂p − x̂α − z‖22, (15)\nwhere the operation 〈x,y〉 denotes the summation operation of element-wise multiplication in x and y with the same size. Besides, m and γ are the Lagrangian multipliers, while η is a factor for the penalty term. Essentially, the augmented Lagrangian function includes the original objective,\n8 two Lagrange multiplier terms (i.e., Eq. (13) and Eq. (14)), and one penalty term converted from the equality constraint (i.e., Eq. (15)). Specifically, introducing Lagrange multipliers conveniently converts an optimization problem with equality constraints into an unconstrained one. Moreover, for any optimal solution that minimizes the (augmented) Lagrangian function, the partial derivatives with respect to the Lagrange multipliers must be zero [46]. Additionally, the penalty terms enforce the original equality constraints. Consequently, the original equality constraints are satisfied. Besides, by including Lagrange multiplier terms as well as the penalty terms, it’s not necessary to iteratively increase η to ∞ to solve the original constrained problem, thereby avoiding ill-conditioning [45].\nThe ADM algorithm progresses in an iterative manner. During each iteration, we alternate among the optimization of the augmented function by varying each one of (x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) while fixing the other variables. Correspondingly, we present the reasons for each iteration of the ADM algorithm (i.e., Algorithm 2). Indeed, the ADM algorithm involves the following steps:\n1) Find x̂α to minimize the augmented Lagrangian function L(x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) with other variables fixed. Removing the fixed items, the objective turns into\narg min x̂α ‖x̂α − x̃α‖22 + 〈m, x̂p − x̂α − z〉\n+ η · ‖x̂p − x̂α − z‖22,\nwhich can be further reformulated as\narg min x̂α\n1 η ·‖x̂α−x̃α‖22+‖x̂α−(x̂p−z+ m 2η )‖22. (16)\nLetting Jx̂α = x̂p − z + m2η and setting the gradient of the objective function in Eq. (16) to be zero, it yields\nx̂α = 1\nη + 1 · (x̃α + η · Jx̂α). (17)\n2) Find z to minimize the augmented Lagrangian function L(x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) with other variables fixed. The corresponding mathematical formula is\narg min z λ1‖z‖22 + 〈m, x̂p − x̂α − z〉\n+ η · ‖x̂p − x̂α − z‖22.\nSimilarly, it can be reformulated as\narg min x̂α λ1 η · ‖z‖22 + ‖z − (x̂p − x̂α + m 2η )‖22. (18)\nLetting Jz = x̂p − x̂α + m2η and setting the gradient of the objective function in Eq. (18) to be zero, it yields\nz = 1\nλ1/η + 1 · Jz. (19)\n3) Find x̂p to minimize the augmented Lagrangian function L(x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) with other variables fixed. It gives\narg min x̂p\nλ2‖x̂p −Ds‖22 + 〈m, x̂p − x̂α − z〉\n+ η · ‖x̂p − x̂α − z‖22.\nThat is\narg min x̂p λ2 η · ‖x̂p −Ds‖22 + ‖x̂p − (x̂α + z − m\n2η )‖22. (20)\nDefine Jx̂p = x̂α + z − m2η and set the corresponding gradient in Eq. (20) to be zero. It becomes\nx̂p = 1 / ( λ2 η + 1) · (λ2 η Ds + Jx̂p). (21)\n4) Find D and s to minimize the augmented Lagrangian function L(x̂p, x̂α, z,D, s,m, γ, η) with other variables fixed. In fact, the objective function turns into\narg min D,s\nλ2‖x̂p −Ds‖22 + γ · ‖s‖1. (22)\nObviously, this optimization problem in Eq. (22) is exactly the sparse signal recovery problem without the dictionary a priori in Section II-B. Inspired by the dictionary learning methodology (namely the means to learn the dictionary or basis sets of large-scale data) in [26], the corresponding solution alternatively determines D and s and thus involves two sub-procedures, namely online learning algorithm [26] and LARS-lasso algorithm [47]. Algorithm 1 provides the skeleton of this solution.\nAlgorithm 1 The Sparse Signal Recovery Algorithm without a Predetermined Dictionary\ninitialize the dictionary D as an input dictionary D(0) (which could be the dictionary learned in last calling this Algorithm), the number of iterations for learning a dictionary as T , two auxiliary matrices A(0) ∈ RK×K and B(0) ∈ RK×K with all elements therein equaling zero.\n1: for t = 1 to T do 2: Sparse coding: computing s(t) using LARS-Lasso al-\ngorithm [47] to obtain\ns(t) = arg min s λ2‖x̂p −D(t−1)s‖22 + γ · ‖s‖1. (23)\n3: Update A(t) according to\nA(t) ← A(t) + s(t)(s(t))T .\n4: Update B(t) according to\nB(t) ← B(t) + x̂p(s(t))T .\n5: Dictionary Update: computing D(t) online learning algorithm [26] to obtain\nD(t) = arg min D λ2‖x̂p −Ds(t)‖22 + γ · ‖s(t)‖1\n= arg min D Tr(DTDA(t))− 2Tr(DTB(t)). (24)\n6: end for 7: return the learned dictionary D(t) and the sparse coding\nvector s(t).\nIn order to update the dictionary in Eq. (24), the proposed sparse signal recovery algorithm utilizes the\n9 concept of stochastic approximation, which is firstly introduced and mathematically proved convergent to a stationary point in [26]. On the other hand, based on the learned dictionary, the concerted effort to recover a sparse signal could be exploited. As mentioned above, the well known LARSlasso algorithm [47], which is a forward stagewise regression algorithm and gradually finds the most suitable solution along a equiangular path among the already known predictors, is used here to solve the problem in Eq. (23). Meanwhile, it is worthwhile to note that other compressive sensing algorithms [38] could also be used here.\n5) Update estimate for the Lagrangian multiplier m according to steepest gradient descent method [48], namely m←m+η · (x̂p− x̂α−z). Similarly, update estimate γ by γ ← γ + η · ‖s‖1. 6) Update η ← η · ρ. In Algorithm 2, we summarize the steps during each iteration. Notably, without loss of generality, consider a known traffic vector x(0, · · · , t) of a given cell at different moments (0, · · · , t). Then, we could estimate the α-stable related parameters according to maximum likelihood methods, quantile methods, or sample characteristic function methods in [33], [34]. Afterwards, we could conduct Algorithm 2 to predict the traffic volume at moment t + 1. Similarly, we need reestimate the α-stable related parameters according to methods in [33], [34], in terms of the traffic vector x(0, · · · , t+1), and perform Algorithm 2 to predict the traffic volume at moment t+2. It can be observed that, compared to Algorithm 1, which is an application of the lines in [26], Algorithm 2 is made up of some additional iterative procedures to procure the parameters without known a priori. Besides, most steps involved in Algorithm 2 are deterministic vector computations and thus computationally efficient. Therefore, the whole framework could effectively yield the traffic forecasting results."

      "text" : "We validate the prediction accuracy improvement of our proposed framework in Algorithm 2 relying on the practical traffic dataset. Specifically, we choose the traffic load records of these three service types of applications generated in 113 cells within a randomly selected region from Dataset 1. Moreover, we intentionally divide the traffic dataset into two part. One is used to learn and distill the parameters related to traffic characteristics, and the other part is to conduct the experiments to verify and validate the accuracy of the proposed framework in Algorithm 2. Specifically, we compare our prediction x̂p with the ground truth x in terms of the normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) [11], which is defined as\nNMAE = ∑N i=1 |x̂p(i)− x(i)|∑N\ni=1 |x(i)| . (25)\nBesides, we utilize LARS-lasso algorithm [47] and OMP [38] respectively to perform the sparse recovery process, and choose the α-stable model based (36,10,1)-linear prediction algorithm in Section IV-A as the performance baseline. In\nAlgorithm 2 The Dictionary Learning-based Alternating Direction Method initialize x̂p, x̂α, z, D, s, m, γ, η according to x̂ (0) p , x̂ (0) α ,\nz(0), D(0), s(0), m(0), γ(0), η(0), and the number of iterations T .

In particular, use two sub-procedures namely online learning algorithm [26] and LARS-lasso algorithm [47] to update D and s, respectively. 6: Update m according to m(t) ← m(t−1) + η(t−1) · (x̂ (t) p − x̂(t)α − z(t)). 7: Update γ by γ(t) ← γ(t−1) + η(t−1) · ‖s(t)‖1. 8: Update η by η(t) ← η(t−1) · ρ, here ρ is an iteration ratio. 9: end for\n10: return the predicted traffic vector x̂p.\nother words, we would exploit traffic records in the last three hours to train the parameters of α-stable models and predict traffic loads in the next 5 minutes.\nAs described in Algorithm 2, most of the parameters could be set easily and tuned dynamically within the framework. Therefore, we can benefit from this advantage and only need to examine the performance impact of few parameters, namely λ1, λ2, γ and η, by dynamically adjusting them. By default, we set λ1 = 10, λ2 = 1, γ = 1 and η = 10−4, and the number of iterations8 in Algorithm 2 and sparse signal recovery algorithm (i.e., Algorithm 1) to be 20 and 3, respectively. We also use (36,10,1)-linear prediction algorithm in Section IV-A to provide the “coarse” prediction results x̃α, and examine the corresponding performance improvement of the proposed ADM framework with different sparse signal recovery algorithm (i.e., LARS-Lasso algorithm [47] and OMP algorithm [38]). Besides, we impose no prior constraints on D, s, and z, and set them as zero vectors.\nFig. 7 gives a performance comparison in terms of NMAE, when we predict the traffic loads under the default settings. In order to provide a more comprehensive comparison, the simulations run in both busy moments (i.e., 9AM, 12PM, and 4PM) and idle ones (i.e., 6AM and 9PM) of one day. As\n8Actually, throughout the literature, the stopping criterion could be a predefined sufficiently large number, just as we did in our manuscript. Meanwhile, the iterative process could stop if the results between two consecutive iterations are sufficiently small. In our study, these predefined few iterations could still yield satisfactory good prediction performance.\n10\ndepicted in Fig. 7, the proposed framework significantly outperforms the α-stable model based (36,10,1)-linear prediction algorithm. In particular, the NMAE of the proposed framework can be as 12% small (e.g., prediction for 12PM video traffic) as that for the classical linear algorithm. This performance improvement can be interpreted as the gain by exploiting the embedded sparsity in traffic and taking account of the originally existing prediction error of linear prediction. Moreover, it can be observed that in most cases, different sparse signal recovery algorithm has little impact on the prediction accuracy. Therefore, the applications of the proposed framework could pay little attention to the involved sparsity methods.\nNext, we further evaluate the performance of our proposed ADM framework with LARS-Lasso algorithm and present more detailed sensitivity analyses in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10, by varying λ1, λ2, and η. Fig. 8 shows that the prediction\naccuracy nearly stays the same irrespective of λ1. This means that the noise component has limited contribution to the corresponding performance. It also implies that the choice of λ1 could be flexible when we apply the framework in practice.\nAccording to Fig. 9, the influence of λ2 is comparatively more obvious and even diverges for different service types. Specifically, a larger λ2 has a slightly negative impact on predicting the traffic loads for IM and web browsing service, but it contributes to the prediction of video service. Recalling the sparsity analyses in Section III-B, video service demonstrates the strongest sparsity. Meanwhile, a larger λ2 means to put more emphasis on the importance of sparsity. Hence, compared to the other two service types, it becomes natural to result in a better performance for video service, when λ2 becomes larger. It’s worthwhile to note here that, in Eq. (14), λ2 and γ are coupled together as well, and should have inverse performance impact. Therefore, due to the space limitation, the performance impact of γ is omitted here.\nFig. 10 depicts the performance variation with respect to η, which is similar to that with respect to λ2. But, a larger\n11\nη has a positive impact on predicting the traffic loads for IM and web browsing service, but it degrades the prediction performance of video service. This phenomenon is potentially originated from the very distinct characteristics of these three services types (e.g., different α-stable models’ parameters and different sparsity representation), and needs a further careful investigation. However, it safely comes to the conclusion that the proposed framework provides a superior and robust performance than the classical linear algorithm."

Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards, with the aid of the traffic “big data”, we make a comprehensive study over the modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical modeling characteristics, including α-stable modeled property in the temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.",
