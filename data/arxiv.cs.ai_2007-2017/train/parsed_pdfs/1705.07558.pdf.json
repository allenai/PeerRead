Levin ∗\nCombinatorial evolution and forecasting of system requirements is examined. The morphological model is used for a hierarchical requirements system (i.e., system parts, design alternatives for the system parts, ordinal estimates for the alternatives). A set of system changes involves changes of the system structure, component alternatives and their estimates. The composition process of the forecast is based on combinatorial synthesis (knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, hierarchical morphological design). An illustrative numerical example for four-phase evolution and forecasting of requirements to communications is described.\nKeywords: Modular system, requirements, communications, evolution, forecasting, decision making, combinatorial optimization\n1. Introduction\nRecently, the significance of evolution and forecasting for communication systems has been increased (Table 1).\nTable 1. Some modeling problems for evolution, history evolution in communications\nNo. Study Source(s) 1. Modeling of topology evolutions and implication on proactive [36]\nrouting overhead in MANETs 2.

Analysis of challenges and opportunities for next generation [8,10]\nof mobile networks\nIn general, the following three-layer framework can be examined (Fig. 1): (i) system requirements, (ii) standards, (iii) system(s)/product(s). As a result, the problems of system evolution and forecasting can be examined for each of the above-mentioned layers of communications (i.e., system requirements, standards, system(s)/product(s)).\nThe article addresses combinatorial evolution and forecasting of requirements to communications (Table 2). The study of modular systems (systems, standards, system requirements) is based on morphological\n∗Mark Sh. Levin: Inst. for Inform. Transmission Problems, Russian Academy of Sciences; http://www.mslevin.iitp.ru; email: mslevin@acm.org\n2 model (a set of part/components, set of design alternatives (DAs) for each part/component above, and ordinal estimates of DAs) [17,19,23]. The system composition process is based on qualities of the selected DAs and qualities of their interconnections (compatibilities) (IC). The system composition is considered as combinatorial synthesis (knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, hierarchical morphological multicriteria design approach HMMD) [17,19,23]. The author’s approach to combinatorial evolution and forecasting has been described in [17,18,19,20,22,23]. The corresponding applied examples of the approach are pointed out in Table 3. The presented illustrative numerical example for four-phase evolution and forecasting of communications requirements to network topology can be considered as a basis for analogical studies in communications and other domains.\nKnowledge representation in product design systems is systematically studied (e.g., [3,9]). Here, modular systems (or corresponding modular/composite alterantives/solutions) are examined as the following (i.e., system configuration) (e.g., [19,23]): (a) a set of system elements (parts, components, modules), (b) a special structure over the system elements, e.g., hierarchy, tree-like structure. In addition, system element alternatives can be considered (including estimates of the alternatives).\nFig. 2 depicts a composite (modular) system, consisting of n parts/components/modules (P i, i = 1, n) and corresponding three design alternatives (DAs) for each part/component/module P i [17,19,23]. For DAs, the following information is considered (i.e., morphological system structure) (e.g., [17,19,23]: (a) estimates of DAs (e.g., vector estimates, ordinal estimates, interval multiset estimates), (b) estimates of compatibility between DAs of different system components (e.g., ordinal estimates, interval multiset estimates).\nGenerally, the following system change operations types can be studied and used [17,18,19,21,23]: I. Operations for DAs: 1.1. change/ improvement of DA O1, 1.2. deletion of DA O2, 1.3. addition of DA O3, 1.4. aggregation of DAs O4. II. Operations for IC: change/improvement of DAs compatibility IC O5. III. Operations for subsystems (system parts, components): 3.1. change/improvement of a system part O6, 3.2. deletion of a system part O7, 3.3. addition of a system part O8, 3.4. aggregation of system parts O9.\n3 IV. Operations for the system configuration/structure (change/extension): (O10). For each operation above, a set of attributes has to be examined (e.g., required resources, profit). Special binary relations over the operations can be examined as well (e.g., compatibility, complementarity) [19]. As a result, the improvement process can be considered as selection and/or composition of the above-mentioned operations (items) while taking into account objective function(s) and resource constraint(s). This process can formulated as designing an improvement configuration (e.g., knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, HMMD). The considered scheme of system evolution and forecasting involves the following stages (Fig. 3) [18,19,22,23]:\nStage 1. Analysis of chain of system generation and detection of system changes between neighbor system generations. Stage 2. Integration of system changes into a general set of the changes (change operations/items) while taking into account expert judgment. Stage 3. Selection/generation of a “basic” system, for example as the next existing system generation. Stage 4. Design of forecast as combinatorial modification of the basic system: system reconfiguration on the basis of combinatorial synthesis of change items (e.g., knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, HMMD).\n3. Example for evolution and forecasting of requirements\nThe illustrative example of combinatorial system evolution and forecasting is considered on the basis of initial data from [15,20]. The following traditional network hierarchy can be examined: (a) international (multi-country, continent) network (GAN), (b) metropolitan network (MN), (c) wide area network (WAN), and (d) local area network (LAN). Here, four generations for communication networks (i.e., network topological structure) are considered: Generation 1. Simple minimum cost network as one-connected structure (e.g., minimum cost spanning tree or minimum Steiner tree).\n4 Generation 2. Reliable network (e.g., bi-connected graph). Generation 3. Survivable network (e.g., bi-connected graph with additional links). Generation 4. Multi-layer GRID-like network environment (flexible, upgradeable network with reconfigurable topology). The corresponding tree-like hierarchy of requirements to the network (network topology) above is: Part 1. User requirements A: 1.1. time of transmission T , 1.2. quality (information errors, reliability of connection) Q, 1.3. cost of transmission W . Part 2. System requirements B: 2.1. Basic criteria I: 2.1.1. cost J , 2.1.2. reliability R, 2.1.3. manageability H , 2.1.4. maintenanceability V , 2.1.5. testability E, 2.1.6. modularity M ; 2.2. Dynamic criteria Y : 2.2.1. adaptability L, 2.2.2. safety F , 2.2.3. flexibility K. Part 3. Mobility requirements C. Part 4. Evolution/development requirements D: 4.1. upgradeability U , 4.2. closeness to grid Z. For each leaf node of the structure above, the following design alternatives (DAs) (as levels of satisfiability) are examined: none (X0), low level (X1), medium level (X2), and high level (X3). The four-phase evolution of the hierarchical requirements structure is depicted in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 (DAs as X0 is absent).\n5 The modular presentations of requirements are: Generation 1: S1\n1 = A1 1 ⋆ B1 1 ⋆ C1 0 ⋆ D1 0 =\n(T1 ⋆ Q1 ⋆ W1)⋆ (J1 ⋆ R1 ⋆ H1 ⋆ V0 ⋆ E0 ⋆ M0)⋆ (L0 ⋆ F0 ⋆ K0) ⋆ C0 ⋆ (U0 ⋆ Z0). Generation 2: S21 = A 2 1 ⋆ B 2 1 ⋆ C 2 0 ⋆ D 2 1 = (T2 ⋆ Q2 ⋆ W2)⋆ (J3 ⋆ R2 ⋆ H1 ⋆ V1 ⋆ E1 ⋆ M1)⋆ (L1 ⋆ F0 ⋆ K0) ⋆ C0 ⋆ (U1 ⋆ Z0). Generation 3: S3\n1 = A3 1 ⋆ B3 1 ⋆ D3 1 =\n(T2 ⋆ Q2 ⋆ W2)⋆ (J3 ⋆ R2 ⋆ H2 ⋆ V3 ⋆ E2 ⋆ M1)⋆ (L2 ⋆ F1 ⋆ K1) ⋆ C0 ⋆ (U1 ⋆ Z0). Generation 4: S4\n1 = A4 1 ⋆ B4 1 ⋆ C4 1 ⋆ D4 1 =\n(T2 ⋆ Q3 ⋆ W2)⋆ (J3 ⋆ R2 ⋆ H2 ⋆ V3 ⋆ E2 ⋆ M2)⋆ (L2 ⋆ F1 ⋆ K1) ⋆ C1 ⋆ (U2 ⋆ Z1). The local changes of the requirements with estimates upon two criteria (cost of change, 0 is the best value; profit of change, the maximum value is the best one; expert judgment) are presented in Table 4, Table 5, and Table 6. Now S4 is considered as a basis for the forecasting. A set of prospective change operations/items (improvements, DAs) is contained in Table 7 (ordinal priorities of DAs are based on the use of multicriteria ranking, priority ordinal scale is [1, 3]). HMMD is used [17,19,23]. The best composition of the change operations (improvements) is searched for as the forecast of the system requirement. The hierarchical structure of the composite system improvement is depicted in Fig. 8. Table 8 and Table 9 contain ordinal estimates of compatibilities between DAs (ordinal scale [0, 3]). Finally, two Pareto-efficient composite improvements are (it is assumed composite DAs for AI , BI , DI are compatible):\n(i) SI 1 = A1 ⋆ (B̃2 ⋆ B̂2) ⋆ (D̃2 ⋆ D̂3 ⋆ D3), here N(B I 1 ) = (3; 2, 0), N(DI 1 ) = (3; 2, 1, 0)); (ii) SI 2 = A1 ⋆ (B̃2 ⋆ B̂2) ⋆ (D̃3 ⋆ D̂3 ⋆ D3), here N(B I 1 ) = (3; 2, 0), N(DI 2 ) = (2; 3, 0, 0)).\nThe corresponding two resultant system requirements forecasts are: (i) SF1 = A F 1 ⋆ B F 1 ⋆ C F 1 ⋆ D F 1 = (T2 ⋆ Q3 ⋆ W2) ⋆ (J3 ⋆ R2 ⋆ H2 ⋆ V3 ⋆ E3 ⋆ M3) ⋆ (L2 ⋆ F2 ⋆ K3) ⋆ C1 ⋆ (U2 ⋆ Z3); (ii) SF\n1 = AF 1 ⋆ BF 1 ⋆ CF 1 ⋆ DF 1 =\n(T2 ⋆ Q3 ⋆ W2) ⋆ (J3 ⋆ R2 ⋆ H2 ⋆ V3 ⋆ E3 ⋆ M3) ⋆ (L2 ⋆ F3 ⋆ K3) ⋆ C1 ⋆ (U2 ⋆ Z3).\n6\n7\nThe paper describes our first integrated step to combinatorial evolution and forecasting of requirements to communications. A hierarchical morphological model of the requirements system is used. Forecasting is based on morphological design approach (selection/composition of the best change items while taking into account their compatibility). The future research directions can involve the following: examination of the suggested approach to generations of wireless communications systems and the requirements to the systems.\n5.
