      "text" : "Conventional studies on spoken dialogue systems (SDS) have investigated either domain-specific task-oriented SDS1 (Williams and Young, 2007) or open-domain non-task-oriented SDS (a.k.a., chatbots or chat-oriented SDS) (Wallace, 2009). The former offers convenience by helping users complete tasks in specific domains, while the latter\n∗Work done during internship at Yahoo Japan Corporation.\n1They can be classified as single-domain or multi-domain task-oriented SDS.\noffers entertainment through open-ended chatting (or smalltalk) with users. Although the functionalities offered by the two types of SDS are complementary to each other, little practical effort has been made to combine them. This unfortunately has limited the potential of SDS.\nThis situation is now being changed by the emergence of voice-activated intelligent assistants on smartphones and home electronics (e.g., Siri2 and Alexa3). These intelligent assistants typically perform various tasks (e.g., Web search, weather checking, and alarm setting) while being able to have chats with users. They can be seen as a novel hybrid of multi-domain task-oriented SDS and open-domain non-task-oriented SDS.\nTo realize such hybrid SDS, we have to determine whether or not a user is going to have a chat with the system. For example, if a user says “What is your hobby?” it is considered that she is going to have a chat with the system. On the other hand, if she says “Set an alarm at 8 o’clock,” she is probably trying to operate her smartphone. We refer to this task as chat detection and treat it as a binary classification problem.\nChat detection has not been explored enough in past studies. This is primarily because little attempts have been made to develop hybrids of task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS (see Section 2 for related work). Although task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS have long research histories, both of them do not require chat detection. Typically, users of task-oriented SDS do not have chats with the systems and users of non-taskoriented SDS always have chats with the systems."

      "text" : "In this work, we construct a new dataset for chat detection. As we already discussed, chat detection\n2http://www.apple.com/ios/siri 3https://developer.amazon.com/alexa\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n00 74\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nhas not been explored enough, and thus there exist no benchmark datasets available. To address this situation, we collected 15, 160 user utterances from real log data of a commercial intelligent assistant, and recruited crowd workers to annotate those utterances with whether or not the users are going to have chats with the intelligent assistant. The resulting dataset will be released to facilitate future studies.\nThe technical challenge in chat detection is that we have to handle open-ended utterances of intelligent assistant users. Commercial intelligent assistants have a vast amount of users and they talk about a wide variety of topics especially when chatting with the assistants. It consequently becomes labor-intensive to collect a sufficiently large amount of annotated data for training accurate chat detectors.\nWe develop supervised binary classifiers to perform chat detection. We address the open-ended user utterances, which characterize chat detection, by using unlabeled external resources. We specifically utilize tweets (i.e., Twitter posts) and Web search queries to enhance the supervised classifiers.\nExperimental results demonstrated that, while simple supervised methods are effective, the external resources are able to further improve them. The results demonstrated that the use of the external resources increases over 1 point of F1-score (from 86.21 to 87.53)."

      "text" : "Task-oriented and non-task-oriented SDS have long been investigated independently, and little attempts have been made to develop hybrids of the two types of SDS. As a consequence, previous studies have not investigated chat detection without only a few exceptions.4\nNiculescu and Banchs (2015) explored using non-task-oriented SDS as a back-off mechanism for task-oriented SDS. They, however, did not propose any concrete methods of automatically determining when to switch to non-task-oriented SDS.\n4Unfortunately, we cannot discuss little about chat detection in existing commercial intelligent assistants since most of their technical details have not been disclosed. We make the best effort to compensate for it by comparing the proposed methods with our in-house intelligent assistant in the experiment.\nLee et al. (2007) proposed an example-based dialogue manager to combine task-oriented and nontask-oriented SDS. In such a framework, however, it is difficult to flexibly utilize state-of-the-art supervised classifiers as a component.\nOther studies proposed machine-learning-based frameworks for combining multi-domain taskoriented SDS and non-task-oriented SDS (Wang et al., 2014; Sarikaya, 2017). These assume that several components including a chat detector are already available, and explore integrating those components. They discuss little on how to develop each of the components. On the other hand, the focus of this work is to develop one of those components, a chat detector. Although it lies outside the scope of this paper to explore how to exploit chat detection method in a full dialogue system, the chat detection method is considered to serve, for example, as one component within those frameworks."

      "heading" : "2.2 Intent and domain determination",
      "text" : "Chat detection is related to, but different from, intent and domain determination that have been studied in the field of SDS (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014; Ravuri and Stolcke, 2015; Kim et al., 2016; Zhang and Wang, 2016).\nBoth intent and domain determination have been investigated in domain-specific task-oriented SDS. Intent determination aims to determine the type of information a user is seeking in singledomain task-oriented SDS. For example, in the ATIS dataset, which is collected from an airline travel information service system, the information type includes flight, city, and so on (Tur et al., 2010). On the other hand, domain determination aims to determine which domain is relevant to a given user utterance in multi-domain task-oriented SDS (Xu and Sarikaya, 2014). Note that it is possible that domain determination is followed by intent determination.\nUnlike intent and domain determination, chat detection targets hybrid systems of multi-domain task-oriented SDS and open-domain non-taskoriented SDS, and aims to determine whether the non-task-oriented component is responsible to a given user utterance or not (i.e., the user is going to have a chat or not). Therefore, the objective of chat detection is different from intent and domain determination.\nIt may be possible to see chat detection as a spe-\ncific problem of domain determination (Sarikaya, 2017). We, nevertheless, discuss it as a different problem because of the uniqueness of the “chat domain.” It greatly differs from ordinary domains in that it plays a role of combining the two different types of SDS that have long been studied independently, rather than combining multiple SDS of the same types. In addition, we discuss the use of external resources, especially tweets, for chat detection. This approach is unique to chat detection and is not considered effective for ordinary domain determination.\nIt is interesting to note that chat detection is not followed by slot-filling unlike intent and domain determination, as far as we use a popular response generator such as seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014) or an information retrieval based approach (Yan et al., 2016). Although joint intent (or domain) determination and slot-filling has been widely studied to improve accuracy (Guo et al., 2014; Zhang and Wang, 2016), the same approach is not feasible in chat detection."

For example, Jiang et al. (2015) investigated predicting whether users are satisfied with the responses of intelligent assistants by combining diverse features including clicks and utterances. Sano et al. (2016) explored predicting whether users will keep using the intelligent assistants in the future by using long-term usage histories.\nSome earlier works used the Cortana dataset as a benchmark of domain determination (Guo et al., 2014; Xu and Sarikaya, 2014; Kim et al., 2016) or proposed a development framework for Cortana (Crook et al., 2016).

This research direction was pioneered by Ritter et al. (2011), who applied a phrase-based SMT model to the response generation. Later, Vinyals and Le (2015) used the seq2seq model (Sutskever et al., 2014). To date, a number follow-up studies have been made to improve on the response quality (Hasegawa et al., 2013; Shang et al., 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016a,b; Gu et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2016). Those studies assume that users always want to have chats with systems and investigate only methods of generating appropriate responses to given utterances. Chat detection is required for integrating those response generators into intelligent assistants."

Voice Assist.6 The log data were collected between Jan. and Aug. 2016. In the log data, some utterances such as “Hello” appear frequently. To construct a dataset containing both high and low frequency utterances, we set frequency thresholds7 to divide the utterances into three groups (high, middle, and low frequency) and then randomly sampled the same number of utterances\n5The utterances are all in Japanese. Example utterances given in this paper are English translations.\n6https://v-assist.yahoo.co.jp 7We cannot disclose the exact threshold values so as to keep the detailed statistics of the original log data confidential.\nfrom each of the three groups. During the data collection, we ensured privacy by manually removing utterances that included the full name of a person or detailed address information.\nNext, we recruited crowd workers to annotate the 15, 160 utterances with two labels, CHAT and NONCHAT. The workers annotated the CHAT label when users were going to have chats with the intelligent assistant and annotated the NONCHAT label when users were seeking some information (e.g., searching the Web or checking the weather) or were trying to operate the smartphones (e.g., setting alarms or controlling volume). Note that our intelligent assistant works primarily on smartphones and thus the NONCHAT utterances include many operational instructions such as alarm setting. Example utterances are given in Table 1.\nSeven workers were assigned to each utterance, and the final labels were obtained by majority vote to address the quality issue inherent in crowdsourcing. The last column in Table 1 shows the number of votes that the majority label obtained. For example, five workers provided the CHAT label (and the other two provided the NONCHAT label) to the first utterance “Let’s talk about something.”"

      "text" : "The construction process described above yielded a dataset made up of 4, 833 CHAT and 10, 327 NONCHAT utterances.\nWe investigated the annotation agreement among the crowd workers. Table 2 shows the distribution of the numbers of votes that the majority labels obtained. The annotation given by the seven workers agreed perfectly in 5, 811 of the 15, 160 utterances (38%). Also, at least six workers agreed in the majority of cases, 10, 789 (= 4, 978 + 5, 811) utterances (71%). This indicates high agreement among the workers and the reliability of the annotation results.\nDuring the data construction, we found that a typical confusing case arises when the utterance can be interpreted as an implicit information request. For example, the utterance “I am hungry” can be seen as the user trying to have a chat with the assistant, but it might be the case that she is looking for a local restaurant. Similar examples include “I have a backache” and so on. One solution in this case might be to ask the user a clarification question (Schlöder and Fernandez, 2015). Such an exploration is left for our future research.\nAdditionally, we manually classified the CHAT utterances according to their dialogue acts to figure out how real users have chats with the intelligent assistant (Table 3). The set of dialogue acts was designed by referring to (Meguro et al., 2010). As shown in Table 3, while some of the utterances are boilerplates (e.g., those in the GREETING act) and thus have limited variety, the majority of the utterances exhibit tremendous diversity. We see\na wide variety of topics including private issues (e.g., “I am free today”) and questions to the assistant (e.g., “Are you angry?”). Also, we even see a movie quote (“May the force be with you”) and a rooster crow (“Cock-a-doodle-doo”) in the MISC act. These clearly represent the open-domain nature of the user utterances in intelligent assistants.\nInterestingly, some users curse at the intelligent assistant probably because it failed to make appropriate responses (see the CURSE act). Although such user behavior would not be observed from paid research participants, we observe a certain amount of curse utterances in the real data."

We follow (Kim, 2014) to develop a simple CNN that has a single convolution and max-pooling layer followed by the soft-max layer.

Thanks to the rapid evolution of the Web in the past decade, a variety of textual data including not only conversational (i.e., chat-like) but also non-conversational ones are abundantly available nowadays. These data offer an effective way of enhancing the base classifiers. We specifically use tweets and Web search queries as conversational and non-conversational text data, respectively.\nWe train character-based9 language models on tweets and Web search queries, and use their\n8We used the same log data used in Section 3.

Let u = c1, c2, . . . , cm be an utterance made up of m characters. Then, the score scorer(u) of the language model trained on the external resource r ∈ {tweet, query} is defined as\nscorer(u) = 1\nm m∑ t=1 log pr(ct | c1, . . . , ct−1).\nThe GRU language model is adopted for its superior performance (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014). Let xt be the embedding of t-th character and ht be the t-th hidden state. GRU computes the hidden state as\nht = (1− zt) ht−1 + zt h̃t zt = σ(W (z)zt +U (z)ht−1)\nh̃t = tanh(W (h)xt +U (h)(rt ht−1)) rt = σ(W (r)xt +U (r)ht−1)\nwhere is the element-wise multiplication, σ is the sigmoid and tanh is the hyperbolic tangent. W(z), U(z), W(h), U(h), W(r), and U(r) are weight matrices. The hidden states are fed to the soft-max to predict the next word.\nWe also use a binary feature indicating whether the utterance appears in the Web search query log or not. We observe that some NONCHAT utterances are made up of single entities such as location and product names. Such utterances are considered to be seeking information on those entities. We therefore use the query log as an entity dictionary to derive a feature indicating whether the utterance is likely to be a single entity.\nThe resulting three features are incorporated into the SVM-based classifier straightforwardly (Figure 1). For the CNN-based classifier, they are provided as additional inputs to the soft-max layer (Figure 2)."

Another reason would be that our SVM classifier uses carefully designed features beyond word 1-grams.\nTable 4 also represents that the external resources are effective, improving F1-scores almost 1 points in both SVM and CNN.

To realize such hybrid dialogue systems, this paper investigates determining whether or not a user is going to have a chat with the system. To address the lack of benchmark datasets for this task, we construct a new dataset consisting of 15, 160 utterances collected from the real log data of a commercial intelligent assistant (and will release the dataset to facilitate future research activity). In addition, we investigate using tweets and Web search queries for handling open-domain user utterances, which characterize the task of chat detection. Experiments demonstrated that, while simple supervised methods are effective, the use of the tweets and search queries further improves the F1-score from 86.21 to 87.53.",
