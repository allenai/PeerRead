      "text" : "DOI:10.5121/ijfcst.2014.4606 59\noriginal Euclidian distance as the similarity measure in the input feature space can be approximated by the Hamming distance. The training costs of these methods, however, are basically expensive. Another popular problem with high dimensional data is known as the “curse of dimensionality”. So we need some methods to reduce the dimension of feature vectors. Manifold learning is an emerging and promising approach in non-parametric dimension reduction. A manifold is a topological space that is locally Euclidean, i.e. around every point, there is a neighborhood that is topologically the same as the open unit ball in . An Earth is a good example of a manifold. Locally, at each point on the surface of the Earth, we have a 3-D coordinate system: two for location and one for the altitude. Globally, it is a 2-D sphere that is embedded in a 3-D space [13]. Manifolds offer a powerful framework for dimensionality reduction problem. The key idea of dimensionality reduction is to find low dimensional structure that is embedded in a higher dimensional space. Occam's razor has been used to support dimensionality reduction. The main idea of Occam’s razor is to select the simplest model from a set of equal models to explain a given phenomenon. Moreover, if the data are indeed generated according to a manifold, then a manifold based learning can be optimal [13]. In recent studies, Manifold learning algorithms have been used for many applications. Nathan Mekuz [14] worked on Local Linear Embedding (LLE) method for face recognition problem. Raducanu [15] represented Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps (S-LEM) in order to enhance accuracy of classification task on some face datasets. Carlotta Orsenigo [16] proposed manifold learning methods for cancer microarray data classification. Abdenour Hadid [17] worked on demographic classification from face videos using manifold learning. Yahong Han [18] proposed manifold learning application for image classification on out of sample data. Xianming Liu [19] worked on cross-media manifold learning for image retrieval and annotation task. In this paper, we investigate an advanced manifold learning method for image auto-annotation task. Local Tangent Space Alignment is used to reduce the dimension of some visual features. After reducing the dimension of feature vectors, new features are used for our multi-label classifier. We compare these methods with some other dimensionality reduction methods. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces dimensionality reduction and Section 3 explains Diffusion maps manifold learning method and Diffusion maps algorithm is used to solve the curse of dimensionality problem of KNN classifier. Section 4 introduces experimental setup and experimental results. At the end of this paper, we make a conclusion in Section 5."

      "text" : "The problem of nonlinear dimensionality reduction method can be defined as follows. Assume we have dataset representation in a nD matrix X consisting of n datavectores ( ∈{1, 2, … , n}) with dimensionality D. Assume that this dataset has intrinsic dimensionality of d (where d < D, and often we have d ≪ D ). Intrinsic dimensionality means that the points in dataset X are lying on or near a manifold with dimensionality of d that is embedded in the D-dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction problems map the dataset X with dimensionality D into a dataset Y with dimensionality d while retaining the geometry of the data as much as possible. Neither the geometry of the data manifold, nor the intrinsic dimensionality d of the dataset X are known. So, dimensionality reduction is a problem that can only be solved by assuming certain properties of the data. Throughout the paper, datapoint is denoted by , where is the ’th row of the D-\ndimensional data matrix X. The low-dimensional of is denoted by , where is the ’th row of the d-dimensional data matrix Y. [20]. Figure (1) shows taxonomy of techniques for dimensionality reduction. The main distinction between techniques for dimensionality reduction is the distinction between linear and nonlinear techniques. Linear techniques assume that the data lie on or near a linear sub-space of the highdimensional space. Nonlinear techniques for dimensionality reduction do not rely on the linearity assumption as a result of which more complex embedding of the data in the high-dimensional space can be identified. In section 3 we discuss Diffusion maps nonlinear dimensionality reduction."

      "text" : "The diffusion maps (DM) algorithm [21, 22] originates from the dynamical systems. Maaten [20] introduced LEM as follows. Diffusion maps techniques are based on a Markov random walk on the graph of the data.when the random walk for a number of time steps occurs, a measure for the proximity of the datapoints is obtained. By using this measure, the diffusion distance an define. In the low-dimensional representation of the data, the pairwise diffusion distances are kept as well as possible. In the diffusion maps, first the graph of the data is constructed. The weights of the edges in this constructed graph are computed using the Gaussian kernel function, leading to a matrix W with the following entries\n=\nɕ (1)\nwhere ɕ indicates the variance of the Gaussian. Afterwards, the normalization process of the matrix W is performed in a way that its rows add up to 1. In this way, a matrix ( ) is constructed with entries\n( ) = ∑\n(2) Since diffusion maps techniques originate from dynamical systems, the resulting matrix ( ) is regarded a Markov matrix that defines the forward transition probability matrix of a dynamical process. So, the matrix ( ) shows the probability of a transition from one datapoint to another datapoint in one time step. The forward probability matrix for t time steps ( ) can given by ( ( )) . By using the random walk forward probabilities ( ), the diffusion distance is computed by\n( )( , )= ∑ ( ( ) ( ))\n( ) (3)\nIn the equation (3) , ( ) is for attributing more weights to parts of the graph with the high density. It is can defined by ( ) =∑ , where is the degree of node omputed by\n= ∑ . From Equation (3), it can be concluded that pairs of data points with a high forward transition probability have a small diffusion distance. The main idea behind the diffusion distance is that it is based on many paths in the graph. This makes the diffusion distance more robust to noise than the geodesic distance. In the low-dimensional representation of the data Y , diffusion maps attempt to keep the diffusion distances. It can be shown by spectral theory on the random walk that the low-dimensional representation Y that retains the diffusion distances is constructed by the d nontrivial principal eigenvectors of the eigen problem\n( ) = (4) Because the graph is fully connected, the largest eigenvalue is minor (viz. λ = 1), its eigenvector\nis thus discarded. So The low-dimensional representation Y is given by the next d principal eigenvectors. In the low dimensional representation Y, the eigenvectors can normalized by their corresponding eigenvalues. Therefore, the low-dimensional data representation Y is given by\nY={λ , λ , . . . λ } (5)"

So we decrease the dimensions of these three feature vectors to d={10, 20, 30, 40, 50} dimensions. First the dimensionality reduction time for each of four methods is summarized in Table (1). Target dimensionality is set to d=30, and we use a 5-core Intel 2.30 GHz system for computation. We compare the performance of DM method with three other dimensionality reduction algorithms; PCA, LLE and LEM. The dimensionality reduction time of PCA is the lowest between all methods and the dimensionality reduction time of DM is the highest between all methods. Next we summarized the results for image annotation task. We give a comparison of the annotation accuracy (Average Precision) with k=8 in KNN method. Average Precision is originally used in information retrieval systems to evaluate the document ranking performance for query retrieval [27]. In our comparison, DM exhibit superior performance, and achieve comparable and better performance than the other three algorithms. Because we tested on three features, we show our experimental result of each feature separately. The first feature is 73-D edge direction histogram. The results for annotation with this feature are summarized in Figure (6). On 73-D edge direction histogram, the performance of PCA of is the lowest between all methods. The DM achieves the best performance. The results of LLE and LEM are moderate. The second feature is 144-D color auto-correlogram (HSV). The results for annotation with 144-D color auto-correlogram (HSV) feature are summarized in Figure (7). The third feature is 225-D block-wise color moments (LAB). The DM achieves the best performance. The results for annotation with 225-D block-wise color moments (LAB) feature are summarized in Figure (8).

      "text" : "In this article, we investigated and compared a manifold learning dimensionality reduction algorithm (DM) for image annotation task. Obtaining powerful small algorithms in a scalable manner is an important issue in implementing large-scale image annotation systems. Linear methods like PCA enable training in linear time and are suitable for this purpose. Overall, we can balance the trade-off between computation efficiency and annotation accuracy by selecting the dimensions of feature vectors. We can obtain a small-dimension latent subspace reflecting the semantic distance of instances. We used DM method for this goal and we achieve the best performance in value of Average precision. Our future work could be extended to other compression formats and the other advanced manifold learning algorithms."

    "abstractText" : "Automatic image annotation is one of the most challenging problems in machine vision areas. The goal of this task is to predict number of keywords automatically for images captured in real data. Many methods are based on visual features in order to calculate similarities between image samples. But the computation cost of these approaches is very high. These methods require many training samples to be stored in memory. To lessen this burden, a number of techniques have been developed to reduce the number of features in a dataset. Manifold learning is a popular approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we investigate Diffusion maps manifold learning method for web image auto-annotation task. Diffusion maps manifold learning method is used to reduce the dimension of some visual features. Extensive experiments and analysis on NUS-WIDE-LITE web image dataset with different visual features show how this manifold learning dimensionality reduction method can be applied effectively to image annotation.",
