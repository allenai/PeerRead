      "text" : "Data publishing without revealing sensitive information is an important problem. Many privacy definitions have been proposed based on generalizing/suppressing data (l-diversity [21], k-anonymity [28] [29], t-closeness [20]). Other alternatives include value swapping [23] and noise addition (e.g., differential privacy [8]). Generalization consists of replacing identifying attribute values with a less specific version [4]. Suppression can be viewed as the ultimate generalization, replacing the identifying value with an “any” value. [4]. These approaches have the advantage of preserving truth, but a\n∗The author was visiting Qatar University when this work was prepared.\nless specific truth that reduces the utility of the published data.\nXiao and Tao proposed anatomization as a method to enforce l-diversity while preserving specific data values [32]. Anatomization splits tuples across two tables, one containing identifying information and the other containing private information. The more general approach of fragmentation [5] divides a given dataset’s attributes into two sets of attributes (2 partitions) such that an encryption mechanism avoids associations between two different small partitions. Vimercati et al. extend fragmentation to multiple partitions [6], and Tamas et al. propose an extension that deals with multiple sensitive attributes [10]. The main advantage of anatomization/fragmentation is that it preserves the original values of data; the uncertainty is only in the mapping between individuals and sensitive values.\nThere is concern that anatomization is vulnerable to several prior knowledge attacks [16], [12]. While this can be an issue, any method that provides any meaningful utility fails to provide perfect privacy against a sufficiently strong adversary [8]. Legally recognized standards such as the socalled “Safe Harbor” rules of the U.S. Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [13] allow release of data that bears some risk of re-identification; the belief is that the greater good of beneficial use of the data outweighs the risk to privacy.\nThis paper does not attempt to resolve that issue (although we use a randomized rather than optimized grouping that provides resistance to the type of attacks above.) Instead, this paper attempts to develop a simple and efficient decision tree learning method from an l-diverse dataset which satisfies l-diversity in anatomization. The developed decision tree is embedded into a recent client-server database model [24,25].\nThe database model is a storage outsourcing mechanism that supports anatomization. In this database model, the client is the owner of the data and stores the data at the server in an l-diverse anatomy scheme. The server provides some query preprocessing that reduce client’s workload. The model proposed by Nergiz et al. has four significant aspects relevant to this paper [24,25]: 1) a given data table (or dataset) of a client is split into two partitions, a sensitive table (single sensitive attribute) and an identifier table (multiple identifying or quasi-identifying attributes). 2) A join key is stored with\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n05 79\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n8 O\nct 2\n01 6\nthe data, but encrypted with a key known only to the client, preventing the server from associating a sensitive value with the correct identity. 3) There is also an unencrypted grouplevel join key allowing the server to map a group of identifiers with a group of sensitive attributes, these groups are l-diverse. 4) The server can use this group information to perform some query processing (or in the case of this paper, tree learning), reducing the client effort needed to get final results. The reader is advised to visit [24, 25] for further details and performance aspects of Nergiz et al.’s database model.\nThis paper investigates whether it is possible to learn a decision tree in the above database model with minimal client resource usage. We assume that the client has limited storage and processing resources, just enough to make small refinements on any model learned at the server. The remainder of this paper refers to the server of Nergiz et al.’s client-server database model as a cloud database server (CDBS). Terms “CDBS” and “server” are used interchangeably."

      "text" : "There have been studies in how to mine anonymized data. Fung et al. [9] give a top-down specialization method (TDS) for anonymization so that the anonymized data allows accurate decision trees. Chui et al. [3] and Leung et al. [18] address the frequent itemset mining problem. Ngai et al. proposes a clustering algorithm that handles the anonymized data as uncertain information [26]. Kriegel et al. propose a hierarchical density based clustering method using fuzzy objects [17]. Xiao et al. discusses the problem of distance calculation for uncertain objects [31]. Nearest Neighbor classification using generalized data is investigated by Martin [22]. Zhang et al. studies Naive Bayes using partially specified data [33]. Dowd et al. studies decision tree classifier with random substitutions [7]. Kantarcioglu et al. proposes a new Support Vector classification and Nearest Neighbor classification that deals with anonymized data [14]. They extend the generalization based anonymization scheme to keep all necessary statistics and use these statistics to build effective classifiers. Freidman et al. investigate learning C4.5 decision trees from datasets that satisfy differential privacy [27]. Jagannathan et al. propose a tree classifier based on random forests that is built from differentially private data [15].\nThese methods are all based on generalization/suppression or noise addition techniques. Anatomized data provides additional detail that has the potential to improve learning, but also additional uncertainty that must be dealt with. In addition, the database model of [24, 25] provides exact matching information that can be extracted only at the client; providing additional opportunities to improve learning.\nAnother approach related to mining anatomized data in the client-server database model is vertically partitioned data mining (e.g., [11, 30]). Vertically partitioned data mining makes strong assumptions about data partitions and what data can be shared, and typically assume that each party holding data has significant computational power. For example, some decision tree techniques assume that two tuples of two partitions can be linked directly to each other, that the tuples are ordered in the same way; and that the\nclass labels are known for both partitions. In one sense, our problem is easier, as one party (client) can see all the data. However, we assume this party (again client) does not have the resources to even store all the data, much less to build the tree."

      "text" : "The model of [25] would allow a client to construct an exact decision tree by downloading the identifier and sensitive tables of a dataset (or data table), decrypting the join key, and joining the identifying and sensitive information (rebuilding the original dataset). The remainder of this paper will use terms dataset and data table interchangeably. The goal of this paper is to reduce resource requirements at the client, by doing as much work as possible at the server. The challenge is that the server is not allowed to know exact mappings between identifying and sensitive information (and server can’t know without background knowledge these mappings due to l-diversity of anatomization scheme).\nWe assume that the class attribute is not the sensitive attribute, as effectively learning this at the server implies a de-facto violation of l-diversity. However, predicting values that fall into identifying information (e.g., predicting geographic location given other demographics and a disease) does not necessarily face this difficulty. We thus perform processing involving identifying attributes at the server. The client then needs only do the necessary processing to utilize the sensitive attribute to complete the tree.\nThe key novelty is that this final processing is:\n1. Performed only when a prediction would make use of that information, and\n2. The cost is amortized over many predictions.\nThe resource requirements (including memory, CPU cost, and communications) remain relatively low per prediction, thus allowing this to be performed on lightweight clients that are assumed to have limited storage capabilities.\nWe first give a set of definitions and define a prediction task for anatomized data. We then detail our method, along with cost and privacy discussions. Section 4 shows performance with experiments on various UCI datasets. The performance evaluation includes execution time, memory requirement and classification accuracy. We conclude the paper with a brief summary and future directions."

      "heading" : "2. DEFINITIONS AND PREDICTION TASK",
      "text" : "We give a set of definitions that are required to explain our work, and use them to define the prediction task for anatomized data.\nDefinition 1. A dataset D is called person specific dataset for population P if each tuple t ∈ D belongs to a unique individual p ∈ P .\nThe person specific dataset D has A1, · · · , Ad identifier attributes and a sensitive attribute As. We use D.Ai to refer\nto the ith attribute of a person specific dataset D. Similarly, we use t.Ai to refer to the ith attribute of a tuple in a person specific dataset D (either 1 ≤ i ≤ d or i = s holds).\nDefinition 2. A group Gj is a subset of tuples in dataset D such that D = ∪mj=1Gj , and for any pair (Gj1, Gj2) where 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m, Gj1 ∩Gj2 = ∅.\nDefinition 3. A set of groups is said to be l-diverse if and\nonly if for all groups Gj ∀v ∈ πAsGj , freq(v,Gj) |Gj | ≤ 1 l where As is the sensitive attribute in D, freq(v,Gj) is the frequency of v in Gj and |Gj | is the number of tuples in Gj .\nWe define anatomy as in [24,25].\nDefinition 4. Given a person specific datasetD partitioned in m groups using l-diversity without generalization, anatomy produces a identifier table IT and a sensitive table ST as follows. IT has schema\n(A1, ..., Ad, GID,ESEQ)\nwhere Ai ∈ IT for 1 ≤ i ≤ d = |IT |, IT is the set of identifying attributes in D, GID is the group id of the group and ESEQ is the encryption of a unique sequence number, SEQ. For each Gj ∈ D and each tuple t ∈ Gj (with sequence number s), IT has a tuple of the form:\n(t.A1, ..., t.Ad, j, Ek(salt, s))\nThe ST has schema\n(SEQ,GID,As)\nwhere As is the sensitive attribute in D, GID is the group id of the group and SEQ is a (unique but randomly ordered) sequence number for that tuple in ST , used as an input for the ESEQ of the corresponding tuple in IT . For each Gj ∈ D and each tuple t ∈ Gj , ST has a tuple of the form:\n(s, j, t.As)\nThe reason why the anatomy definition [32] is extended in [24, 25] and in this paper is that CDBS operations like selection, insertion, deletion etc. require the consideration of the (encrypted where necessary) sequence number. The sequence number is in fact used to rebuild the original mapping between the identifying attributes and the sensitive attributes of a given tuple (cf. Section 1). The sequence numbers and encrypted sequence numbers are created during the splitting phase of an outsourced table (cf. Section 1). Here is a brief explanation of how this mechanism works in several database operations:\nFirstly, ESEQ field values in the identifying table are decrypted by the client to find the true sequence number of given tuples. Secondly, the true sequence number values in the identifying table is equi-joined with the sequence number SEQ field values in the sensitive table. The database has some sequence numbers in the sensitive table ST which are same as the true sequence numbers (this is guaranteed in the initial splitting phase, see Section 1). The original tuples are eventually rebuilt after this equi-join operation. The reader is directed to [24, 25] for further issues about CDBS design. In this paper, we will use sequence number values to do client-side refinement of the decision tree.\nDefinition 5. An l-diverse group G is said to have a simple l-diverse distribution if\n∀p ∈ G and ∀v ∈ πAsGj , P (p.As = v) = (freq(v,Gj))\n|Gj |\nwhere p denotes an individual and As, freq(∗) are as in Definition 3.\nDefinition 6. A person specific dataset D has simple ldiverse distribution if for every groupGi ∈ D where 1 ≤ i ≤ m holds, Gi has a simple l-diverse distribution according to Definition 5.\nThis paper focuses on collaborative decision tree learning between the client and CDBS. Next, we define the principal components of the collaborative decision tree.\nDefinition 7. Given two partitions IT and ST of a person specific dataset D, a base decision tree (BDT) is a decision tree classifier that is built from A1, · · · , Ad attributes (IT ). Given a BDT that has leaves Y ; every leaf y ∈ Y has tuples in the following format:\n(t.A1, · · · , t.Ad, j, Ek(salt, s))\nj, Ek(salt, s) fields are ignored when the BDT is learned. Note that the BDT maintains the simple l-diverse distribution which is the privacy constraint of CDBS. Given a leaf y ∈ Y , each tuple t ∈ y is equally likely to matchl different values of As. The privacy issues with the base decision tree are discussed in the next section.\nDefinition 8. Given a base decision tree BDT , the leaves Y ∈ BDT ; a leaf y ∈ Y is called a refined leaf if and only if it points to a sub-tree rooted at y that is encrypted (using symmetric key encryption).\nWe will elaborate in the privacy discussion of the next section how and why a base decision tree has encrypted subtrees.\nDefinition 9. Given a base decision tree BDT , the leaves Y ∈ BDT ; a leaf y ∈ Y is called unrefined leaf if and only if it doesn’t point to a sub-tree rooted at y.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Y is used to note the leaves of a decision tree.\nWe finish the discussion in this section by defining the prediction task of our classifier. The prediction task is to predict an identifying attribute (Ai ∈ IT ) given other identifying attributes (Aj satisfying 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ d) and the sensitive attribute (As).\nA real life example would be learning from patient health records. The U.S. Healthcare laws protect individually identifiable health information [1]. An anatomized database, while it contains individually identifiable information, does not link this directly to the (sensitive) health information. Suppose we have public directory information as identifying attributes including zipcode, gender, age, as well as specific identifiers such as name (which are presumably uninteresting for building a decision tree.) We also have a sensitive table consisting of diagnosis. Suppose the goal was to identify locations where people with particular backgrounds (including health conditions) live, through learning a decision tree with class value location. While this seems a somewhat contrived example, it would likely have identified the infamous Love Canal district [19] as an unusually common location for those with the diagnosis birth defect."

      "text" : "We investigate three possible approaches to build decision trees from anatomized data in Nergiz et al.’s client-server database model. We call this family of decision trees as anatomization decision trees, because they are all built from anatomized data. Each approach differs according to how IT and ST tables are used.\nIn the discussion of anatomization decision trees, algorithms that require encryption are assumed to use AES-128 symmetric key encryption. We first discuss two baseline approaches: pure-client side learning, and pure server-side learning. Section 3.2 explains the collaborative decision tree learning. We finally compare collaborative decision tree learning with the baselines in Section 3.3."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Baseline Approaches: CDBS Learning and Client Naïve Learning",
      "text" : "The baseline approaches compose two different scenarios for learning. The first scenario is that the CDBS learns a base decision tree using only the IT partition of dataset D (cf. Section 2). The second scenario is that client learns a decision tree using the person specific dataset D retrieved from the CDBS. We call the first learning scenario CDBS learning and the second learning scenario client näıve learning.\nIn client näıve learning, the client retrieves the person specific dataset D by getting all the tuples in the respective IT and ST partitions of D. IT and ST partitions are joined together using the join key and the non-anatomized set of records in dataset D is obtained (cf. Sections 1 and 2). The client learns decision tree from this non-anatomized set of records in dataset D. In other words, the client rebuilds from its outsourced data the non-anatomized version (original version) of dataset D and learns the decision tree itself without any attribute uncertainty. Client näıve learning\nbrings up some vital issues and respective solutions below:\nThe privacy aspect of the decision tree is an issue. The client learns the decision tree from the non-anatomized version of D, so the identifying attributes and the sensitive attribute are associated in the decision tree. The client has to store this model at the CDBS (limited storage resource assumption, see Section 1), but since the model is built from non-anatomized dataset, it may reveal information violating privacy constraints (particularly in conjunction with the anatomized data). The solution is to encrypt the decision tree and to store the encrypted tree at CDBS.\nEncrypting the decision tree raises the issue of how to make an inference of the class label for a new instance. The CDBS cannot make the inferences because the stored tree is encrypted. This leads to the following approach: each time the class label of a new tuple is predicted, the client retrieves the encrypted decision tree, decrypts the encrypted decision tree and makes the prediction. This makes the inference phase quite expensive for the client in client näıve learning.\nThe other extreme is CDBS learning: the server constructs a base decision tree using only the identifying information. Base decision tree makes the prediction operation very easy and low cost for the client. Given a predicted tuple tp and a base decision tree for predicting class label Ac ∈ IT ; the client just deletes the attribute field tp.As (an O(1) time operation). Then, it sends the rest of the tuple tp to the CDBS and CDBS makes the tree inference. The client has O(1) inference cost and network overhead. This low cost for client is the main advantage of CDBS learning. The drawback of CDBS learning is that the base decision tree ignores the sensitive attribute. This is not a big drawback if As is a weak predictor of the class label. On the other hand, the base decision tree’s accuracy is likely to be low if As is a strong predictor of the class label."

      "heading" : "3.2 Collaborative Decision Tree Learning",
      "text" : "One way to mitigate the drawbacks of CDBS learning and client näıve learning is the usage of grouping statistics among anatomy groups of the person specific dataset D. Grouping statistics are the distribution of As among anatomy groups Gi provided that 1 ≤ i ≤ m and ∪mGi = D hold. Grouping statistics might have the potential to determine an interesting decision tree split for a class label Ai ∈ IT . However, to avoid correlation-based attacks, we assume the insertion\noperation of CDBS is designed to create groups randomly while satisfying the simple l-diverse distribution [25]. It is unlikely to find an interesting pattern for split using group statistics.\nThis paper proposes a new collaborative decision tree algorithm involving CDBS and client collaboration. Given a dataset D partitioned on IT and ST , IT and ST partitions stored on CDBS, a class label Ai ∈ IT ; CDBS initiates building the collaborative decision tree. First, the server builds a base decision tree. Then, the base decision tree leaves Y are improved by the client. For every leaf y ∈ Y , the improvement is a sub-tree learned by the client. The client uses the tuples in leaf y to learn an improved sub-tree. Figures 1, 2 and 3 give pseudo code of the collaborative decision tree learning process.\nFigure 1 shows the Main() function that is called by CDBS to initiate collaborative learning. The LearnDT(IT) function call builds the base decision tree from the IT partition. The client improvements on the base decision tree are made on the fly when doing predictions. To make a prediction, a tuple (ins.A1, · · · , ins.Ai−1, ins.Ai+1, · · · , ins.Ad) is sent to the CDBS. The getInstance() function call receives the sent tuple ins (cf. Figure 1). FindBDTLeaf(baseDT, ins) function is called by CDBS for every predicted tuple ins once the predicted tuple ins is received by getInstance() calls (cf. Figure 1).\nThe FindBDTLeaf function essentially finds the appropriate base decision tree leaf y ∈ Y for the client to complete (if not already done) and sends leaf y to the client (cf. Figure 2). Given tuple ins and the base decision tree baseDT, the findLeaf(BDT,ins) function call finds the correct leaf y ∈ Y using a usual decision tree inference with attribute values (ins.A1, · · · , ins.Ai−1, ins.Ai+1, · · · , ins.Ad). Then, FindBDTLeaf verifies if y points to an encrypted sub-tree that was previously learned by a client (if statement in pseudocode). (The subtree is encrypted to ensure privacy constraints are satisfied, this will be discussed in more detail later.) If y points to an encrypted sub-tree, it\nsends the client the encrypted sub-tree as a response message (sentMessage(encrSubTree) function call). Otherwise, CDBS sends the tuples belonging to y by function call sentMessage(leafIns).\nAll tuples t ∈ y are partitioned across IT and ST on CDBS. Reconstructing the original tuples t ∈ y is done on the client side (Inference() function call, cf. Figure 3, explained later). The joinTables(leafIns, ST, GID) function call prepares the message leafIns including the following tuples: leafIns include every tuple t ∈ y with all combinations of l sensitive attributes. In other words function joinTables() matches every tuple t ∈ y with all l potential sensitive attributes using the GID field as the join key (a group-level join, giving all possible tuples given the l-diverse dataset, not just the true matching values). The explanation of Inference() function will clarify why this join operation is done (cf. Figure 3).\nA client calls the Inference() function to make predictions or on the fly improvements (cf. Figure 3). The client sends a predicted tuple ins to the CDBS using the sendInstance() function. It receives the message sent by function FindBDTLeaf() using receiveMessage(). As mentioned in the FindBDTLeaf() discussion, the message can be either an encrypted sub-tree (encrTree) or tuples t of leaf y (leafIns). leafIns is in fact all tuples t ∈ y such that every tuple t is matched with all l potential sensitive attribute values. If the message is an encrypted sub-tree (encrTree), Inference() just decrypts the encrypted sub-tree using decipherTree() function, finds the appropriate leaf y′ as in regular tree inference using findLeaf() function and predicts the class label of tuple ins by taking majority of the class labels\nin y′ using majorityLabel() function. If message is leafIns, the Inference() function reconstructs the nonanatomized leaf instances (instances) from leafIns: it decrypts the encrypted sequence numbers ESEQ in identifying attributes of leafIns to find true sequence numbers and eliminates the tuples t of leafIns that don’t have the sensitive table sequence numbers SEQ the same as true sequence numbers. trueInstances() function does the former operation. We discussed earlier in Section 2 how this sequence number fields are designed and how they are used in Nergiz et al.’s client server database model [24, 25]. Inference() learns a sub decision tree (subTree) from instances using learnDT() function, encrypts subTree (encryptTree() function call) and sends subTree back to CDBS for updating as we discussed earlier in FindBDTLeaf(). Finally, Inference() finds the appropriate leaf y′ as in regular tree inference using findLeaf() function and predicts the class label of tuple ins by taking majority of the class labels in y′ using majorityLabel() function.\nWe finish the discussion in this subsection by considering the encryption of the client’s improved sub-trees. Encryption is necessary due to privacy concerns. Once the sub-tree is built, it has leaves having tuples in (t.A1, · · · , t.Ad, t.As) format. Moreover, the sub-tree also has splits with the true values of As. Thus, whole sub-tree should be encrypted so that no additional information regarding the correlation between tuples and sensitive values is provided to the CDBS when the sub-tree is stored. The symmetric key encryption of sub-tree preserves the privacy of person specific dataset D according to following theorem.\nTheorem 1. (Privacy Preserving Learning): Given a person specific dataset D on CDBS having a simple l-diverse distribution, the collaborative decision tree learning preserves the simple l-diverse distribution of D.\nProof. Given a snapshot IT (i) and ST (i) of D on CDBS at time i, suppose that a collaborative decision tree is learned using the algorithm in Figures 1–3. CDBS learns the associations within the identifying attributes (Figure 1). The CDBS is allowed to learn such associations according to its privacy definition [24] [25]. These associations do not provide any background information linking identifying attributes and sensitive attribute. The Client learns all associations within identifying attributes and the sensitive attribute (cf. Figure 3), but no additional information is provided back to the server (except in encrypted form.) The simple l-diverse distribution is maintained for snapshots IT (i), ST (i) at ith time. The inference operation at jth time (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ ∞) is done with CDBS and client. The base decision tree has only associations between identifying attributes, so the CDBS part of inference is safe. The encrypted sub-trees are used on client side of inference, so assuming semantically secure encryption this gives no further information to the CDBS. Throughout predictions, some base decision tree leaves might never be visited, but this only discloses that certain identifying information has not come up for prediction. This is not a disclosure case about sensitive information. CDBS cannot know whether the sensitive attribute has a better information for the unvisited leaves’ tuples as sensitive attributes’ positive/negative cor-\nrelation or uncorrelation with identifying attributes would not be known without any background knowledge. The encrypted subtrees of visited leaves do not let CDBS learn this kind of correlation information. Consequently, collaborative decision tree learning preserves the simple l-diverse distribution in inference at time j.\nOur privacy analysis doesn’t include the case where there are multiple clients that outsource different data. The reader might be concerned that if there are multiple clients who outsource their data in anatomization format, some clients’ identifying information can be other clients’ sensitive information. This cross correlation might create privacy concerns about the whole client-server database model. This is an issue dealt in the original Nergiz et al.’s client-server database model [24, 25]. Since we have shown that our decision tree learning reveals no additional information, it cannot result in privacy violations provided the underlying database does not violate privacy constraints."

      "heading" : "3.3 Cost Discussion",
      "text" : "It is difficult to estimate a practical average cost savings for collaborative decision tree learning, as it depends not only on the data, but on the client’s memory, processing, and communication resources.\nIf the identifying attributes are bad predictors, the base decision tree will be complex. A complex decision tree model means that it has many splits yielding small leaves, requiring only a small amount of client memory and computation during the prediction phase. The client needs to build more complex sub-trees to achieve good prediction. However, small leaves means that the cost per sub-tree will be small, even though the total cost (amortized over many predictions) is high. If the identifying attributes are good predictors, the base decision tree will be simple. A tree having few splits will yield fewer, but larger leaves. This increases the cost for the first prediction, but also increases the likelihood that future predictions will hit an already completed subtree.\nIn either case, the client requires less memory than client näıve learning, as it needs to hold at most the tuples that reach a leaf, along with all possible sensitive values for those tuples. The next theorem gives an upper bound for collaborative decision tree learning cost under reasonable assumptions and feasible alternatives.\nTheorem 2. (Cost Upper Bound) Given a person specific dataset D, IT and ST partitions on CDBS storing D, similar number of splits in base decision tree, client improvement sub-trees and client näıve learning tree; the client cost of collaborative decision tree learning cannot be bigger than client näıve learning’s cost.\nProof. Assume that D is O(n×m) where n is the number of rows and m is the number of attributes. Let us also assume that the client cost of collaborative decision tree learning is bigger than the client näıve learning cost. Given a base decision tree with O(m) leaves, depth, and split (worst case tree type); the total cost of base decision tree learning\nis O(nm2). This cost is excluded in client cost since it is not executed by the client. Given a client sub-tree on the ith base decision tree leaf (ni is number of rows) with O(m) splits, leaves and depth (same as base decision tree); the cost of learning a sub-tree is O(nim\n2). The total cost of collaborative decision tree learning is O( ∑ i nim\n2) which is O(nm2) (1 ≤ i ≤ m). Given client näıve learning’s resulting model with O(m) splits, leaves and depth (same as base decision tree); the total client cost is O(nm2). Client näıve learning has a client cost that is equal to the collaborative decision tree learning’s client cost. This result contradicts to the basic assumption. Thus, collaborative decision tree learning cost cannot be bigger than client näıve learning cost by contradiction.\nThe same theorem can be developed for encryption, decryption and network costs as well (intrinsic). The number of splits assumption in the cost theorem is a worst case assumption for cost calculation. In practice, the sub-tree on the ith leaf of the base decision tree will be much simpler (have fewer splits) than both the base decision and client näıve learning trees. Client sub-trees would be learned from less data and less data yields the simple subtrees having fewer splits. Fewer splits mean low training, inference, encryption/decryption and network costs for client in collaborative decision tree learning."

      "heading" : "4. EXPERIMENTS",
      "text" : "We now compare our collaborative decision tree learning (cdtl) with the client näıve (cnl) and CDBS learning (cdbsl) on four datasets from the UCI collection: adult, vote, autos and Australian credit. We evaluate two things: The classification accuracy (presumably better than clbs, but worse than client näıve), and the cost for those performance improvements.\nThe Adult dataset is composed of US census data. An individual’s income is the class attribute (more than 50K vs less than 50K). It has 48842 tuples where each tuple has 15 attributes. The Vote dataset contains 485 tuples where each tuple has 16 binary attributes. An attribute is the vote of a senator in a session. A senator’s party affiliation is the class attribute (democrat vs republican). The Autos datasets contains 205 tuples where each tuple has 26 attributes. The class label is either symboling (risk rating) or price of a car. Autos dataset’s continuous attributes are discretized in our experiments and a binary class label is created from price of a car (low price vs. high price). The Australian credit dataset has 690 tuples where each tuple has 16 attributes. The class attribute is whether a credit application is approved or not (+ vs. −). We chose these four because they are large enough to demonstrate performance differences, and reasonably challenging for decision tree learning. The reader is advised to visit [2] to learn more about the structure of the datasets.\nExperiments 1 and 2 are made on auto and vote datasets respectively, because they can simulate a real world example of l-diverse data. While privacy may not be a real issue for this data, we give an examples below that we feel are a reasonable simulation of a privacy-sensitive scenario. (True privacy-sensitive data is hard to obtain and publish results\non, precisely because it is privacy-sensitive.) Experiment 1 uses attribute symboling (risk rating) as the sensitive attribute and predicts the attribute price. Suppose that there is a dealership outsourcing their cars’ pricing data. Clients might not want to buy some of their cars because of high risk factor (high insurance premium), so l-diversity is preserved for symboling. Experiment 2 is done on the vote dataset. It sets physician fee-freeze as the sensitive attribute. Suppose that senate’s voting records are outsourced to a cloud database. Voting records in public sessions are available and they can be used with party affiliation to identify a senator’s identity. Thus, the voting records of a private session should be l-diverse.\nExperiments 3 and 5 are made on the Australian credit dataset and adult dataset. Decision tree models fit well on these datasets. These experiments show how the cdtl models behave when the underlying data is convenient for decision tree learning. Experiment 3 uses Australian credit dataset. It assigns attribute A9 as sensitive attribute and predicts the class attribute. Experiment 4 uses the adult dataset. It assigns attribute relationship as sensitive attribute and predicts the class attribute. Relationship and A9 are the strongest predictors of class labels in adult and Australian credit datasets. Experiment 4 and 5 measure together the effect of the sensitive attribute’s predictor power given a fixed dataset. In experiment 5, the adult dataset is used again with sensitive attribute age that is a moderate predictor. Experiments 4 and 5 use the tuples which belong to individuals in non-private work class. So, the experiments are made on a subsample of 14936 tuples.\nOn each experiment, we apply cdbsl, cnl, cdtl with 10-fold cross validation. We measure accuracy, memory savings and execution time savings. Weka J48 is used for decision tree learning with reduced error pruning. 20% of the training sets are used for reduced error pruning. Given a training/test pair of 10-fold cross validation, the prune set is chosen randomly once so that cdbsl, cnl, cdtl models are compared within the same model space (same pruning set and training set for each algorithm). The experiments on vote and australian credit datasets learn binary decision trees whereas the experiments on auto and adult datasets learn non-binary decision trees. Experiments are done using a physically remote cloud server; and a laptop with Intel i5 processor and 4 GB RAM. Internet connection speed was 100 Mbps.\nets = cdtl execution time\ncnl execution time (1)\nms = cdtlmemory requirement\ncnlmemory requirement (2)\nEquations 1 and 2 calculate execution time savings (ets) and memory savings (ms) respectively in the experiments. Savings are maximized as both formulas approach to zero. In contrary, savings are minimized as both formulas approach 1. Execution times (Eq. 1) include client’s encryption/decryption, network and learning/inference costs on a training set and test set pair (ith iteration of cross validation). In equation 2, the number of tuples in training set\nis the cnl’s memory requirement whereas the number of tuples in the base decision tree’s (BDT) biggest leaf is the cdtl’s memory requirement. Since the client learns sub-trees on the fly from the unrefined leaves, the biggest leaf is the memory upper bound.\nFigure 4 and Figure 5 provides box plots showing elapsed time and memory savings measurements on each of the 10 folds. Cdbsl is not shown, as the client cost is 0. The blue dots on the boxplots show the mean time and memory savings. Savings graphs exhibit visually the tradeoff between ms and ets. Given a dataset, if the memory savings are high, the time requirements are low (as expected.) It is expected since the high ms indicates a complex base decision tree model in cdtl. The client needs to do more improvement in cdtl since the leaf provided is already a bad predictor. In addition, high ms and low ets can lead to complex decision trees that can produce overfitting. On the other hand, low ms indicate a simple base decision tree in cdtl. Little remains to be done at the client since the leaf provided is already a good predictor.\nFigure 6 provides measured prediction accuracies in the experiments. On average, the cnl decision trees have the best accuracy, as expected. Cdbsl decision trees have the worst accuracy and cdtl decision trees is generally somewhere between. This accuracy trend is expected since cdbsl gives a decision tree which is essentially the same as the base decision tree in cdtl. So, cdtl’s accuracy values show the effect of client improvements which are done to the cdbsl model. The exception is in experiment 4 (the Adult dataset). The sensitive attribute is not a very good predictor. This ex-\nceptional case shows that the collaborative model becomes too complex after client improving (overfitting). Execution time savings and memory savings graphs justify this fact (Figs. 5 and 6). A possible solution to avoid cdtl overfitting is memory savings threshold (threshold for BDT leaf size on CDBS). However, it is hard to define an exact threshold value. Given a fixed training set on CDBS, cdtl can be learned with various BDT thresholds. The threshold having the best accuracy on the pruning set can be chosen and client improvements can be applied on this model."

      "heading" : "5. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "This paper proposes a decision tree learning method for outsourced data in an anatomization scheme. A real world prediction task is defined for anatomization. Collaborative decision tree learning (cdtl), which uses cloud database server (CDBS) and client, is studied to achieve this prediction task. Cdtl is proven to preserve the privacy of data provider. Cdtl is tested on various datasets and the results show that fairly accurate decision trees can be built whereas client’s learning and inference costs are reduced remarkably.\nThe next challenge is to extend this work in a new framework such that there is no client processing while accurate decision trees are learned. Another direction is to observe how the collaborative decision tree learning algorithm performs relative to the recent differential privacy decision trees."

The privacy model is anatomization/fragmentation: the server sees data values, but the link between sensitive and identifying information is encrypted with a key known only to clients. Clients have limited processing and storage capability. Both sensitive and identifying information thus are stored on the server. The approach presented also retains most processing at the server, and client-side processing is amortized over predictions made by the clients. Experiments on various datasets show that the method produces decision trees approaching the accuracy of a non-private decision tree, while substantially reducing the client’s computing resource requirements.",
