Especially, it is a difficult issue to recognize and represent the implicit features of a piece of text properly.\nDistributed text representations estimated using a neural network are useful to be applied to conventional natural language processing algorithms [1]–[11]. Great improvement by the distributed text representations estimated this way has been reported in name entity recognition and chunking [12], text classification [13]–[16], topic extraction [17], [18], and machine translation [19], [20] etc.\nHowever, some natural language processing tasks are still challenging. For example, the conventional algorithms fail to correctly predicate the number of starts of 40% amazon reviews [16]. It indicates the needs of higher quality text representation to improve the conventional algorithms.\nThe early approaches to estimate text representations use n-gram models [1], [4], [5]. Mikolov et al. propose continuous bag-of-words and skip-gram models [7], [8]. Their\nmethod outperforms the previous algorithms and costs less time. Pennington et al. [10] propose an algorithm using both local information and global information in the corpus and report a higher performance. Bojanowski et al. [11] extend the models of Mikolov et al. using the character-level information of words. Their reported experimental results outperform the original models in syntactic tasks, but fail to achieve an obvious improvement in semantic tasks.\nLexicons are useful for us humans to learn a language. We can use them to help machines to learn natural languages as well. Chen et al. [21] use the definitions in the lexicons to estimate representations for word senses and outperform the sense representations by Huang et al. [5]. Other researches take advantage of the defined synonyms or paraphrases in lexicons. Yu et al. [22] and Bollegala et al. [23] estimate the word representations by not only maximizing the probability of target word given a context, but also minimizing the distance of the paraphrases in a lexicon at the same time. Faruqui et al. [24] propose a method refining trained word representation vectors using lexicons. Xu et al. [25] estimate the word representations jointly by minimizing the distance of the tail word from the sum of the vectors of the head word and the relation for a triplet of words (head, relation, tail), and making words less similar to each other in a larger category. However, even though the previous methods using the paraphrases in lexicons reported improvements in syntactic analogical tasks, all of them failed to outperform the baselines in semantic analogical tasks.\nThere is a not well addressed issue of the previous researches on using paraphrases in lexicons to improve estimated distributed word representations: For polysemous words that have different synonyms in different contexts, if we use the paraphrases to represent them without disambiguation, they may be over-fitted to improper senses. However, disambiguation is another difficult issue. Besides, it is less easy to use if a word has several vectors for its different senses instead of one vector per word, because the usage of such word representations in the conventional systems requires additional word disambiguation. Ke et al. [26] propose a method considering the lexicon as a fuzzy set of paraphrases and using Bernoulli distribution subjected to the membership function of paraphrases to alleviate the problem. Although the method outperforms the previous works in a large corpus, the experimental results show that it is weak at small corpora.\nIn this paper, we propose a new method to improve the distributed word representations using paraphrases in a lexicon\nthat is able to alleviate the overfitting of the polysemous words without disambiguation. Our method is efficient and easy to be combined with the conventional algorithms estimating word representations using corpora. In the experiment, our method outperforms the previous methods using paraphrases and keeps efficient for corpora in different sizes."

The objective of CBOW is to maximize the log probability of a target word given the vectors of the context words. Denote the size of the vocabulary as V , the size of the word vectors as W . The model is like Fig. 1.\nNegative Sampling is an efficient method to maximize the log probability. It is a simplified Noise Contrastive Estimation [27]. It trains the model by distinguishing target from randomly drawn noise.

It is able to alleviate the overfitting of the word vectors for polysemous words. It outperforms the previous works using lexicons to estimate distributed word representations, but is not robust for small corpora. Fig. 2 shows the structure of the model.\nCBOFP adds a lexicon layer to CBOW. Unlike the previous work using lexicons to estimate distributed word representations, in CBOFP, every paraphrase is a fuzzy member of the paraphrase set of a word with a degree of truth. The outputs of the lexicon layer are dropped out randomly. The dropout is controlled by a function of the paraphrases’ degrees of truth that returns 0 or 1 drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. Denote\nthe degree of truth as x, the control function f(x) is defined as the following:\nf(x) ∼ Bernoulli(x). (2)\nThe degree of truth is measured using the score provided by a paraphrase database called PPDB [28]–[30]. Denote the score as S, the paraphrases set as L, the degree x is calculated as the following:\nx = S\nmax L\nS .

      "text" : "Our previous work CBOFP is weak at small corpus because it involves a probabilistic method to alleviate the overfitting of polysemous words. Such a method requires enough amount of training data. Thus we consider another method not using a probabilistic way.\nInstead of dropping out some of the outputs of the lexicon layer randomly, we add a node after the lexicon layer as shown in Fig. 3. The inputs are the context word of the target word. They are both input into the hidden layer that contains the word vectors to learn, and input into the lexicon layer. The lexicon layer outputs the paraphrases of the inputs. The node after the lexicon layer takes the score of the paraphrase and holds a threshold. If the score of the paraphrase is higher than the threshold, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. The paraphrases whose outputs are false are not learned. True paraphrases of the context words are input into the hidden layer to learn together with the original context words. The output of the hidden layer is a vector of the vocabulary size. After softmax, the neural network outputs the target word. By maximizing the probability of outputting correct word, the\n1http://mattmahoney.net/dc/text8.zip\nhidden layer can be trained and used as the vectors represent the words in the vocabulary."

It is reported useful in many other tasks such as recognizing textual entailment [31], [32], measuring the semantic similarity [33]–[35], monolingual alignment [36], [37], and natural language generation [38].\nPPDB2.0 provides not only the paraphrases, but also the features, the alignment types and the entailment types. There are six types of entailment in PPDB2.0 as shown in Table I. We do not consider the “exclusion” type, “other related” type, “independent” type, and only use the more “natural” paraphrases of the “equivalence” type, “forward entailment” type, and “reverse entailment” type.\nFor each word, we build a vector representing the set of its paraphrases in the lexicon layer. Let us denote each paraphrase in PPDB2.0 as (headword, tailword, relationship). For word A, B, C, D, E, if there are paraphrases (A, B, Equivalence), (A, C, Forward Entailment), (D, A, Reverse Entailment), (A, E, Exclusion), (A, F , Independent), and (A, G, OtherRelated), the paraphrase set vector for A is (B,C,D), and E, F , G are discarded.\nAs the score input to threshold node, we use the PPDB2.0 scores. They are estimated by a supervised scoring model on\nthe basis of human judgments for 26,455 paraphrase pairs and high correlation of the PPDB2.0 scores and human judgments are reported [29]."

And it is not very same for different tasks or corpora. However, because all of the score of the paraphrases —the PPDB2.0 scores are less than seven in the version we used, we can find the best threshold in the interval.\nFrom Fig. 4, we see that the best threshold for the semantic part and the total dataset is 3.8, using text8. The best threshold for the syntactic part is 5.7. From Fig. 5, we see that the best threshold for the semantic part and the total dataset is 1.5, using text9. The best threshold for the syntactic part is 5.2. It shows that lower threshold is better for a larger corpus and semantic tasks. The best accuracies are shown in Table III.\nThe other parameters are set as those used by the public word2vec demo4 that are already well tuned. The initial learning rate is set to 0.05.

For jointReps and RC-Net, we\n4https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\nfailed to find an available implements that correctly run using text8 and enwiki9. Thus we use the results in their papers for jointReps and RC-Net. The reported results of RC-Net are achieved using enwiki9 as well, while those of jointReps are achieved using ukWaC5.\nIn Table IV, we compare our proposed neural network under text8 with CBOW, CBOW enriched with subword information, GloVe, the work of Faruqui et al. and CBOFP. We do not compare with jointReps and RC-Net here, because there are no reported results evaluated by the word analogical reasoning tasks of these methods with a similar corpus.\nWe can see that using text8, our proposed neural network achieves the best accuracy in the semantic, and outperforms the others except CBOW enriched with subword information in syntactic part. CBOW enriched with subword information is reported powerful for representing syntactic features, but ours is more balanced.\nIn Table V, we compare our proposed neural network with the previous works using enwiki9. The results of jointReps and RC-Net here are the reported results in their paper. The results of JointReps are not achieved using enwiki9 but using ukWaC.\nWe see that our proposed neural network outperforms the previous works for the semantic part and the whole dataset under enwiki9. The proposed neural network failed to outperform CBOW enriched with subword information in the syntactic part. However, our proposed neural network is better at the semantic part than the CBOW enriched with subword information and outperforms it in the overall accuracy.\nAll of the experimental results show that the proposed neural network is more balanced than the previous works, more powerful than the other works using lexicons to estimate or improve distributed word representations, benefiting from the threshold node alleviating the overfitting of polysemous words. Moreover, while the CBOFP failed to outperform most of the others under text8, the proposed neural network keeps outperform all the others in semantic parts and achieves the second best overall accuracy.

    "abstractText" : "Though there are some works on improving distributed word representations using lexicons, the improper overfitting of the words that have multiple meanings is a remaining issue deteriorating the learning when lexicons are used, which needs to be solved. An alternative method is to allocate a vector per sense instead a vector per word. However, the word representations estimated in the former way are not as easy to use as the latter one. Our previous work uses a probabilistic method to alleviate the overfitting, but it is not robust with small corpus. In this paper, we propose a new neural network to estimate distributed word representations using a lexicon and a corpus. We add a lexicon layer in continuous bag-of-words model, and a threshold node after the output of the lexicon layer. The threshold rejects the “bad” outputs of the lexicon layer that are less likely to be the same with their inputs. In this way, it alleviates the overfitting of the polysemous words. The proposed neural network can be trained using negative sampling, which maximizing the log probabilities of target words given the context words, by distinguishing the target words from random noises. We compare the proposed neural network with continuous bagof-words model, the other works improving it, and the previous works estimating distributed word representations using both a lexicon and a corpus. The experimental results show that the proposed neural network is more efficient and balanced for both semantic tasks and syntactic tasks than the previous works, and robust to the size of the corpus.",
