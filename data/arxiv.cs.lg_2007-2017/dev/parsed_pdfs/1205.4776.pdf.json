      "text" : "A number of visual quality measures have been introduced in visual analytics literature in order to automatically select the best views of high dimensional data from a large number of candidate data projections. These methods generally concentrate on the interpretability of the visualization and pay little attention to the interpretability of the projection axes. In this paper, we argue that interpretability of the visualizations and the feature transformation functions are both crucial for visual exploration of high dimensional labeled data. We present a two-part user study to examine these two related but orthogonal aspects of interpretability. We first study how humans judge the quality of 2D scatterplots of various datasets with varying number of classes and provide comparisons with ten automated measures, including a number of visual quality measures and related measures from various machine learning fields. We then investigate how the user perception on interpretability of mathematical expressions relate to various automated measures of complexity that can be used to characterize data projection functions. We conclude with a discussion of how automated measures of visual and semantic interpretability of data projections can be used together for exploratory analysis in classification tasks.\nKeywords: dimensionality reduction, data visualization, interpretable projection pursuit, user study\nIndex Terms: H.2.8 [Database Management]: Database applications—Data Mining"

      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The high dimensionality of data poses theoretical and practical challenges for visual exploration and analysis. According to the curse of dimensionality [6] theorem, the number of samples needed for a classification task increases exponentially as the number of dimensions (variables, features) increases. Moreover, irrelevant and redundant features might hinder classifier performance. On the other hand, it is costly to collect, store and process data. In exploratory analysis settings, high dimensionality prevents the users from exploring the data visually.\nFeature extraction is a two-step process that seeks suitable data representations that would help us overcome these challenges. Feature construction step creates a set of new features based on the original features and feature selection is the process of finding the best features amongst them. In this paper, we focus on feature extraction methods for visual exploration of labeled data for classification tasks. Various linear (such as principal components analysis (PCA), multiple discriminants analysis (MDA), exploratory projection pursuit) and non-linear (such as multidimensional scaling\n∗e-mail: iicke@gc.cuny.edu †e-mail: andrew@cs.qc.cuny.edu\n(MDS), manifold learning, kernel PCA, evolutionary constructive induction) techniques have been proposed for dimensionality reduction and visualization ( [7, 25, 11]). While each method optimizes a pre-designed intuitive measure of goodness of a visualization, limited number of empirical studies have been reported on how much these measures match human perception.\nIn this paper, we consider two related but orthogonal aspects of human interpretability of data projections for labeled data. Visual interpretability is concerned with how humans judge the quality of the views presented as 2D scatterplots. In the case of labeled data, visual interpretability closely relates to how easy it is to tell the members of each class apart by inspecting the scatterplot. Semantic interpretability is concerned with how these views are generated, namely the complexity of the projection functions that relate the projection axes to the original variables (features, attributes). We devised a two-part experiment to study visual and semantic interpretability. In the first part, we showed scatterplots from four datasets with varying number of classes and asked the participants to rate these views. The participants were not given any background information about the dataset and the attributes since we aimed to investigate how they would rate the views independent from a specific domain. The second part of our experiment aimed to investigate how easily humans would understand mathematical expressions with varying levels of complexity. We generated a generic set of expressions in order to study interpretability independently from a specific domain.\nThis paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives an overview of related work on characterization of the interpretability of views (2D scatterplots) of labeled data. Also included in this section is an overview of related research that addresses the interpretability of the projection (transformation) functions that generate the views. Section 3 presents the details of our user study on how humans interpret the views of datasets containing different number of groups and how the human perception relates to the automated measures proposed in related literature. Section 4 presents our user study on how easily humans can interpret mathematical expressions consisting of variables, coefficients and various operators and the relationship between the human perception and automated measures of expression complexity. We conclude with a discussion (section 5) of application of our results in development of visually and semantically interpretable projections of high dimensional datasets."

      "text" : "The task of selecting interesting [10] or good views of datasets becomes more challenging as the dimensionality increases. For sufficiently high dimensional datasets, manual exploration of the space of views is impractical. In the case of labeled data, the degree of interestingness is related to how easy it is to tell the classes apart from each other by inspecting the visualization.\nLee at al. present a measure for exploratory projection pursuit of labeled data that is based on Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Analysis method in [18]. The VizRank algorithm proposed by Leban et al. searches for informational 2D projections of datasets that\nar X\niv :1\n20 5.\n47 76\nv1 [\ncs .H\nC ]\n2 2\nM ay\n2 01\n2\nare evaluated by a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier [17]. The authors claim almost perfect agreement between the human judgement and the VizRank algorithm through a user study conducted using six datasets. Sips et al. propose two measures based on the notion of class consistency in [22]. One measure is based on preservation of closeness to class centroids after projection, and another is based on the entropies of the spatial distributions of the classes. The authors report a user study on a number of datasets with varying number of classes. They claim that their proposed measures are in alignment with human judgement in terms of finding all views that were labeled as good views by the participants. Tatu et al. propose two measures to evaluate the degree of separation on scatterplots of labeled data in [23]. Tatu et al. report a user study in [24] that compares four visual quality measures that have been proposed in [22] and [23]. The authors suggest that a combination of measures might be worth investigating.\nAs opposed to the various studies on visual interpretability or quality of the projections of labeled data, the interpretability of the projection axes have been addressed only in a few studies. In the case of projection pursuit, the projection functions are given as weighted linear combinations of the original features. Morton defines the interpretability of these projection functions in terms of parsimony (simplicity) and proposes rotation and entropy based methods to simplify the coefficients of the linear projections while preserving the interesting view [19]. El-Arini et al. present a dimensionality reduction method that searches over scatterplots generated by simple arithmetic expressions of the original features and assessed by accuracy of a Bayesian classifier [15]. The authors claim that expressions containing more than one or two features become less interpretable. However, no empirical study has been reported to justify this intuition.\nThere have been a number of related studies in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) field investigating how humans perceive the complexity of mathematical expressions in order to develop improved human-computer interfaces. Anthony et al. study the effects of different input methods (keyboard, handwriting, speech) with respect to the complexity of the mathematical expressions for the purpose of developing intelligent tutoring systems [4] for algebra. The study presented by Awde et al. in [5] aims to find the most appropriate way to present a mathematical expression to visually impaired users. The modality of the presentation is selected based on a notion of human perceived complexity of mathematical expressions inferred through a user study. Their experimental design is similar to ours, where the participants are shown a number of mathematical expressions and asked to re-write and rate the expressions. Then, a relationship between the structural properties of the expressions and the human perceived complexity is derived. The set of expressions they chose came from a wide range of fields including logic and calculus. In our experiments, the set of expressions were limited to various linear/non-linear combinations of a limited number of variables representing possible data projection functions of varying complexity."

      "text" : "We chose four commonly used datasets from the data mining and visual analytics literature (table 1). These datasets were selected because they contain different number of classes ranging from 2 to 9, which would let us investigate how the number and shape of the classes affect the relationship between human perception and the automated measures.\nThe Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset contains 30 measurements characterizing malignant or benign tumors. The Wine dataset contains 13 attributes related to the chemical properties of wines from three different regions of Italy. The Segments dataset contains 19 features derived from images of seven kinds of scenes (brickface, sky, foliage, cement, window, path, grass). All three datasets were downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [2]. The Italian olive oils dataset [27] contains the amounts of eight fatty acids in olive oils that are from nine different regions of the country (downloaded from [1]).\nIn order to compare human judgement on quality of 2D views of labeled data to automated measures we chose ten measures from various fields of machine learning and visual analytics. Wrapper based methods from the feature extraction field have been designed to assess the usefulness of the extracted features with respect to the performance of classification algorithms. In this paper, we utilized four commonly used classification algorithms to assess the quality of the scatterplots for the four datasets mentioned above (section 3.3). A number of cluster validity indices have been proposed in data clustering literature in order to assess the quality of groupings generated by different clustering algorithms. These indices can also be used to measure the quality of the groupings on 2D scatterplots with respect to the class labels of the observations. For our experiments, we included three cluster validity indices (section 3.4). A number of visual quality measures have been introduced in visual analytics literature ( [18, 22, 23]). We included two of the proposed measures that were reported in [24] as the closest matches to the human perception through user studies (section 3.5). Table 2 presents the list of the automated measures we utilized in our experiments.\nFor a dataset with N attributes, there are N(N−1)/2 unique attribute pairs, where each pair can be visualized as a scatterplot. In order to choose the visualizations for our experiment, we first\ngenerated all possible 2D scatterplots for each dataset. We computed the values of the automated measures given in table 2 for the datasets. Our aim was to ensure that we chose a diverse set of visualizations with respect to the automated measures. We created five equi-width bins of values between [0-1]. Then, for each bin, we selected two scatterplots that appeared most frequently within that value range across all the automated measures. Upon completion of this process, a total of 40 scatterplots (10 for each dataset) were selected to be included in our experiments."

      "heading" : "3.3 Wrapper Methods",
      "text" : "Given a labeled multi-dimensional dataset, the goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to build a model from the observed data in order to predict the class membership of an unseen data item correctly. Classification algorithms can be broadly considered in two categories: generative and discriminative [21]. The generative methods aim to infer probabilistic models that generate the data points for each class. The discriminative methods aim to learn a mapping between the features and the class labels directly. Regardless of the method used, the common goal of a classification algorithm is to be able to differentiate class members as accurately as possible.\nSelection of appropriate features improve the performance of classifiers. Therefore, classification performance is used to evaluate the usefulness of feature sets in wrapper based feature selection schemes [16]. Wrapper based feature selection methods can be used to assess the quality of 2D scatterplots of labeled data. Since the goal of a classifier is to tell the classes apart, high accuracy on two selected features would mean a good view of the data.\nFor our experiments, we chose four of the most common (according to [26]) classification algorithms which we briefly discuss here. Each algorithm displays a different decision boundary characteristic that is related to how the algorithm works.\nFigure 2 shows the decision boundaries generated by each algorithm on a view from the Wine dataset. The Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree algorithms generate linear decision boundaries while Naive Bayes and the K-Nearest Neighbors generate non-linear boundaries. Our goal is to investigate how each algorithm’s decision boundary characteristics would relate to human perception of class separation on different datasets with varying number of classes."

A number of methods have been proposed in order to quantify the quality of the outcome of clustering algorithms. In the case of 2D data, cluster validity indices can be used as measures of interpretability of the visualizations. In this section, we discuss three measures that were used in our experiments. The unifying theme of these cluster validity indices is that they all aim to measure compactness and well-separation of the class structures using a distance measure and they are susceptible to outliers. Detailed overview of validity indices can be found in [12, 20].\n3.4.1 C Index (IC) The C Index is a cluster validation index defined in [14]:\nIC = SD−SDmin\nSDmax−SDmin where SD is the total sum, for all classes, of pairwise distances between samples of the same class (total p distances), SDmin and SDmax are the sums of p smallest/largest pairwise distances across the whole dataset. The C index returns values between 0 and 1. Smaller values of IC indicate more compact and better separated class structures.\n3.4.2 Davies-Bouldin Index (IDB) The Davies-Bouldin Index is a measure of compactness and well separation of clusters and it was proposed in [8]:\nIDB = 1 n\nn\n∑ i=1\nmini 6= j{ δ (Xi,X j)\n∆(Xi)+∆(X j) }\nwhere ∆(Xi) is intra-class distance for class i and δ (Xi,X j) is interclass distance for classes i and j. Smaller values of IDB indicate more compact and better separated cluster structures. In our experiments, we normalized the IDB values to [0,1] range.\n3.4.3 Dunn’s Index (IDunn)\nThe Dunn’s index is a measure of compactness and well separation of clusters and it was proposed in [9]:\nIDunn = min1≤i≤n{min1≤ j≤n, j 6=i{ δ (Xi,X j)\nmax1≤k≤n{∆(Xk)} }}\nwhere δ ,∆ are defined as above.

CCM scores each view with respect to how many consistent points it contains:\nCCM = 1− ∑ k c=1 CC(xc)\nM\nCC = { 1, if d(xc, x̄c)< d(xc, x̄i),1≤ i≤ k, i 6= c 0, otherwise\nwhere M is the total number of data points, k is the number of classes, xc is a point in class c and x̄c, x̄i are projections of the centroid of classes c and i respectively.

Tables 5- 8 present the results\nfor each individual dataset. The measures are sorted in descending order with respect to the R2.\nThe R2 values indicate how well the linear regression model fits the data in terms of predicting the participant ratings based on each automated measure. Results on all scatterplots without consideration of a specific dataset (table 4) show that the C Index and the LDA Index did not correlate with how the participants typically judged the “goodness” of a view. Two classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes ranked the top two, tightly followed by the Class Consistency Measure, Dunn Index and K-Nearest Neighbors.\nWhen we look at the results on individual datasets (tables 5- 8), we notice that the Support Vector Machine is no longer one of the top performers for datasets with larger number of classes (Segments and Olive oil). The Dunn Index shows a significant match for all datasets accept for the Olive oils dataset which might be due to the fact that, the class structures contain outliers and in some cases, the members of the same class are clumped together in multiple areas on the scatterplot. Overall, we found that Davies-Bouldin Index, Dunn Index, C Index and LDA Index might not correlate with human perception, depending on the dataset while all others seem to correlate to some extent.\nFrom these results, we infer that the degree of match between the human and the automated measure might depend on the characteristics of the views such as the shape of the clusters formed by the class members. Therefore, we hypothesize that a combination of these measures might model the human perception better than any single measure. In the next section, we derive a composite measure based on the individual measures and investigate its performance across all individual datasets included in our experiments."

Overall, the correlation between the composite measure and human perception was significant across all scatterplots as well as individual datasets.\nOne interesting observation is that, although the two classification algorithms that are related to density estimation (Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbours) were always in alignment with human perception on all datasets, they were excluded from the composite model in favor of the discriminative classifiers."

For each expression, we report the median value of the participant ratings, median value of the total time it took for the participants to write down and rate the expression and the number of correct responses. We first examined the relationship between how an expression is rated by the participants and how frequently it was written down correctly. We hypothesized that the expressions that were frequently replicated incorrectly would also be rated as difficult to interpret by the participants. Indeed, we found that there was a strong correlation between them (Pearson’s R=0.9379, Df=23, p < 0.05) indicating that the ratings given by the participants were consistent with\ntheir observed behavior (answering correctly/incorrectly). We did not find a meaningful relationship between the time taken to write the expression and the subjective rating. Most possibly, it is due to the fact that the participants did not spend much time on those expressions that they found hard to interpret. Therefore, we will present only the results based on the participant ratings here.\nIn order to define a relationship between the structure of the expression and the participant ratings, we determined various attributes of the expressions characterizing the complexity. For this purpose, we utilized a syntax-tree representation for the expressions (figure 6). The number of operands include the variables and other numerical values. A block is a sub-expression composed of multiple operators and operands. The tree depth relates to the nestedness in the expression and the number and size of the blocks indicate the distinguishable components it contains. Table 11 shows the values of the six derived attributes for each expression.\nTable 11 reveals that up to expression size 7 (up to 4 operands or 4 operators), the participants rated the expressions to be very easy-easy (rating ≤ 0.3).\nWe first looked at how much each of these attributes can predict the participant’s ratings on interpretability (table 13). Unsurprisingly, the number of operators and total size affect how the expressions are rated. But this does not explain why the expressions of the same size were rated differently by the participants.\nWe cast a regression problem that learns a mapping between the structural properties of an expression and the degree of human interpretability as reported by our participants. We trained a linear model with leave-one-out cross-validation.\nPredictedHumanRating(PHR) = 0.0854∗Tree Depth+ −0.2568∗Number of Blocks+ −0.1014∗Avg.

Based on\nthis model, we infer that humans rate longer and nested expressions as more difficult to interpret while the existence of small number of compact blocks increase the interpretability."

      "heading" : "5 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we investigated the relationships between human perception and automated measures that aim to quantify interpretability. For visual exploration of high dimensional labeled datasets, we considered two forms of interpretability. Visual interpretability is concerned with how easy it is to tell the members of different classes apart by looking at 2D scatterplots of data. We argued that classifier performance and various clustering validity measures from the machine learning literature can also be used to assess the quality of the views besides the recently proposed visual quality measures. We presented a user study on four datasets with varying number of classes comparing ten automated measures to human perception. Our results indicated that no single measure outperforms others on all datasets. While the Dunn Index, C Index and LDA Index might not correlate with human perception well depending on the dataset, all other measures seem to correlate with human perception to some extent. However, a linear combination of a subset of the automated measures correlated significantly with human perception across all scatterplots as well as individual datasets.\nSemantic interpretability is concerned with how easy it is for humans to understand the data transformation functions that project the original features into lower dimensions. We investigated how humans would rate expressions of varying level of complexity. We found that up to expression size 7 (up to 4 operands or 4 operators), the participants rated the expressions to be very easy-easy (rating ≤ 0.3). Based on a linear combination of various structural properties of an expression, we inferred that humans rated longer and nested expressions as more difficult to interpret while the existence of small number of compact blocks increase the interpretability.\nIn exploratory analysis of labeled data, simple feature-feature combinations might not always be the best views that reveal the class structures. Linear or non-linear feature transformation functions might create better 2D views. However, the space of possible transformation functions is vast. Therefore, automated complexity measures reflecting the human perception closely will be useful in finding interpretable data transformations.\nThe automated measures for visual and semantic interpretability of data transformations can be combined in a number of ways in order to search for good views of data that are also easily understandable in terms of the original attributes. A weighted linear combination of visual and semantic interpretability measures can be utilized or they can be optimized simultaneously using a multiobjective optimization scheme.\nIn conclusion, we state that through investigation of automated measures of visual and semantic interpretability, we can improve exploratory analysis by simultaneously presenting data representations to a user that are both easy to visualize and whose axes represent dimensions that are transparently understood."

These methods generally concentrate on the interpretability of the visualization and pay little attention to the interpretability of the projection axes. In this paper, we argue that interpretability of the visualizations and the feature transformation functions are both crucial for visual exploration of high dimensional labeled data. We present a two-part user study to examine these two related but orthogonal aspects of interpretability. We first study how humans judge the quality of 2D scatterplots of various datasets with varying number of classes and provide comparisons with ten automated measures, including a number of visual quality measures and related measures from various machine learning fields. We then investigate how the user perception on interpretability of mathematical expressions relate to various automated measures of complexity that can be used to characterize data projection functions. We conclude with a discussion of how automated measures of visual and semantic interpretability of data projections can be used together for exploratory analysis in classification tasks.",
