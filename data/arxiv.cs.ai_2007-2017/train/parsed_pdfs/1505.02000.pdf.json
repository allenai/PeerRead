In many of these applications, algorithms based on deep learning has surpassed the previous state-of-art performance. At the heart of all deep learning algorithms is the domain-independent idea of using hierarchical layers of learned abstraction to efficiently accomplish high level tasks [1].\nThis report first provide an overview of traditional artificial neural network concepts introduced in the 1980s, before introducing more recent discoveries that made training deep networks practical and effective.

While they are similar in the sense that they both use a large number of identical and linked simple computational units to achieve high performance on complex tasks, modern ANNs have been so heavily optimized for efficient implementation on electronic computers that they bear little resemblance to their biological counterpart. In particular, time-dependent integrateand-fire mechanism in BNNs have been replaced by steady state values representing frequency of firing, and most ANNs also have vastly simplified connection architectures that allow for efficient propagation. Most current ANN architectures don’t allow loops in connections (with the notable exception of recurrent neural networks which uses loops to model temporal correlations [5]), and also don’t allow connections to be made and broken during training (with the notable exception of evolving architectures based on genetic algorithms [6, 7, 8]).

      "text" : "In a typical neural network, nodes are placed in layers, with the first layer being the input layer, and the last layer being the output layer. The input nodes are special in that their outputs are simply the value of the corresponding features in the input vector.\nFor example, in a classification task that has a 3-dimensional input (x, y, z) and a binary output, one possible network design is to have 3 input nodes, and 1 output node. The input and output layers are usually considered fixed in network design.\nWith only an input layer and an output layer, with all input nodes connected to all output nodes, the network essentially implements a matrix multiply, or a linear transformation. This type of networks can solve simple problems where the feature space is linearly-separable. However, for linearly-separable problems, simpler techniques such as linear regression or logistic regression can usually achieve similar performance, with the only difference being training methods.\nMost modern applications of neural networks use one or more hidden layers – layers that sit between the input layer and the output layers, to allow the network to model non-linearity in the feature space. The number of hidden layers and the number of hidden nodes in each layer are hyper-parameters that are not always easy to determine. While some rules-of-thumb have been proposed, they are still, for the most part, determined by trial-and-error. The risk of using too-small a network is that it may not have enough representative power to model all useful patterns in the input (high bias), while the risk\nof using too-large a network is that it may overfit the data, and start modeling noise in the training set (high variance). It is usually better to err on the side of larger networks, because many effective techniques exist to combat overfitting, as will be detailed in later sections of the report. Using network size to limit overfitting is error-prone, time-consuming, and not very effective.\nMethods have been proposed for automatic hyperparameter tuning, such as evolving cascade networks [9], which trains a large network through an iterative process, by first starting with a minimal network, and in each iteration, train a few ”candidate” networks that have more nodes in different layers, and keeping the best. There are also tuning methods based on genetic algorithms with links turned on and off by each bit in the genes [6, 7, 8]. However, these methods have not seen widespread adoption, due to the large increase in training time, and marginal benefits when overfitting is avoided using other methods than limiting network size.\nIt has been proven that a network with 1 hidden layer can approximate any continuous (in feature space) function to any accuracy, and a network with 2 hidden layers can approximate any function to any accuracy [10, 11]. Given infinite computational power, memory, and training set, there is theoretically no reason to go above 2 hidden layers. However, as will be explained later in the report, it is much more efficient to solve complex problems using a deeper network than one with only 2 hidden layers."

      "text" : "In a neural network, each node (besides input nodes) has one or more scalar inputs, and one output. Each link between nodes have a scalar weight, and each node has a bias to shift the point of activation.\nf( ∑ wi ∗ xi + b) (1)\nThe output of each node is computed as shown in Equation 1, where xi’s are inputs to the node, wi’s are the weights of the associated link, b is a bias associated with the node, and f(x) is a function associated with the node, known as the activation function.\nThere are a few activation functions in widespread use. For output nodes in regression networks, a linear activation function (eg. y = x) is most commonly used to give these networks a range of all real numbers. For output nodes in classification networks, the softmax function (exponential normalization) is often used to transform the outputs into something that can be interpreted as a probability distribution.\nFor hidden nodes, the traditional choices are hyperbolic tangent (y = tanh(x)) and the logistic function (y = 1\n1+e−k(x−x0) ). Both these functions are designed to satisfy 3 conditions -\n• Differentiable everywhere\n• Monotonic\n• Non-linear\nIt was believed that these properties are essential for an activation function.\nThe differentiability property is important because we must be able to take the derivative of the function at any point during training using gradient-based methods. It is not necessary for networks trained using non-gradient-based methods such as genetic algorithm.\nThe monotonicity property is important because if the activation function is not monotonic, it will introduce additional local minimums in the parameter space, and impede training efforts.\nNon-linearity is important because otherwise the network will lose the ability to model non-linear patterns in the training set. Non-linearity is achieved using saturation in this case, with the hyperbolic tangent function saturating at y = −1 and y = 1, and the logistic function saturating at y = 0 and y = 1.\nIn practice, although the logistic function is more biologically plausible, hyperbolic tangent usually allows faster training since being linear around 0 means nodes will not start training in saturation (which would make training much slower) even if inputs are zero or negative [12]."

      "text" : "Training algorithms for neural networks fall into two major categories - gradient-based and nongradient-based. This report focuses on gradient-based methods as it is much more commonly used in recent times, and usually converges much faster as well.\nAs mentioned in Section 2.2, each node in the network has a weight associated with each incoming link, and a scalar bias. The weight and bias of a node are the parameters of the node. If we concatenate the weights and biases of all nodes in a network into one vector θ, it completely defines the behaviour of a network (for a given set of hyper-parameters, ie. network architecture).\ny = f(θ, x) (2)\nIf the set of hyper-parameters (network architecture) is encoded into a function f(), we can define the output of the network as shown in Equation 2, where y and x are the output and input vectors respectively.\nThe goal of the training process, therefore, is to find a θ such that f(θ, x) approximates the function we are trying to model. In other words, given a set of inputs and their desired outputs, we are trying to find a θ that minimizes the difference between the desired outputs and network outputs, for all entries in the training set. For that, a measurement of error is needed.\nE(θ, Ts) = 1\n2 ∑ (xi,yi)∈Ts (yi − f(θ, xi))2 (3)\nOne such error measure is mean-squared-error (MSE), and it is the most commonly used error measure. This is given in Equation 3, where Ts is the training set, xi and yi are the input and desired output of a training pair, N is the number of entries in the training set, and g(xi) is the network output.\nOur goal is to minimize E(θ, Ts) given Ts. For very small networks, it may be feasible to do an exhaustive search to find the point in parameter space where the mean-squared-error is minimized, but for networks of reasonable sizes, an exhaustive search is not practical. Gradient descent is the most commonly used optimisation algorithm for neural networks.\nIn gradient descent, θ is first initialized to a random point in the parameter space. Weights and biases are typically drawn in a way that keeps most nodes in the linear region at the beginning of training. One popular method is to draw from the uniform distribution (− a√\ndin , a√ din ), where a is chosen based\non the shape of the activation function (where it starts to saturate), and din is the number of inputs to the node [13].\n∆θ = −L∂E(θ, Ts) ∂θ\n(4)\nAfter initialization, the gradient descent algorithm performs a walk in the parameter space, guided by the gradient of the error surface. In its simplest form, in each iteration, the algorithm takes a step in the opposite direction of the gradient, with the step size proportional to the magnitude of the gradient, and a fixed learning rate. This is shown in Equation 4, where L is the learning rate, and all other symbols are as previously defined.\n∂E(θ, Ts) ∂wkj = ∂E ∂yj ∂yj ∂xj ∂xj ∂wkj\n(5)\nThe partial derivative of the error function for each parameter is as shown in Equation 5 after applying chain rule, where xj is the result of the summation (input to activation function), yj is the output of the activation function, and wkj is the weight we are examining.\nThe only difference between the output layer and hidden layers is that hidden layers do not really have an error. However, we can still derive error terms for them by calculating its contribution to the input to the activation function of the next node. This is equivalent to another application of chain rule, since the input to the activation function is simply the sum of the contributions from each node in the previous layer. It is convenient to do this propagation backwards, from the final error, multiplying by the derivative of the activation function each time, before ”assigning blame” of the error proportionally to the weights connecting previous layer nodes to the node we are examining. This is the basis of back-propagation, and this is why we require the activation function to be differentiable. A detailed derivation is omitted here for brevity.\nMany variants of gradient descent have been proposed, each with different performance characteristics. The one in most popular use is gradient descent with momentum, where instead of calculating the gradient each time and use that as the step, we combine it with a fraction of the weight update of the previous iteration. This allows faster convergence in situations where the gradient is much larger in some dimensions than others (eg. down the bottom of a valley) [14].\nAnother common variation is learning rate scheduling - changing the learning rate as training progresses. The goal is to get to somewhere close to a local minimum quickly, then slow down to avoid overshooting. This idea is taken further in resilient back-propagation (RPROP), where only the sign of the gradient is used. In RPROP, each weight has an independent learning rate, that is increased (usually multiplied by 1.2) if the sign of the gradient has not changed from the previous iteration, and reduced (usually by a factor of 0.5) if the gradient has changed signs [15]. This allows all weights to train at close to their optimal learning rate, and eliminates the learning rate parameter that must be manually tuned in other gradient descent variants. An initial learning rate still needs to be chosen, but it doesn’t significantly affect training time or result [15]."

      "text" : "When the training set is limited in size as it is usually, it is dangerous to train without any constraint since the network will eventually start to model noise in the training set, and be too specialized to generalize beyond the training set.\nE(θ, Ts) = 1\n2 ∑ (xi,yi)∈Ts (yi − f(θ, xi))2 + λ|θ|2 (6)\nOne popular way to combat overfitting is regularization - the idea of encouraging weights to have smaller values. The most common form of regularization is L2 regularization, where the L2 norm of θ (the parameter vector) is added to the error function, as shown in Equation 6, where λ is a parameter that controls the strength of regularization, and it needs to be tuned. If λ is too low, the network would overfit. If λ is too high, the network would underfit.\nOther norms such as L1 and L12 are also used, with different effects. They will be explored in the discussion of deep networks later in the report."

      "text" : "As mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, a neural network with 2 hidden layers is already theoretically a universal function approximator capable of approximating any function, continuous or not, to any arbitrary accuracy. In light of that, it may seem pointless to pursue networks with more hidden layers.\nThe main benefit of using deep networks is node-efficiency - it is often possible to approximate complex functions to the same accuracy using a deeper network with much fewer total nodes compared to a 2-hidden-layer network with very large hidden layers. Besides computational benefits, a model with a smaller degree of freedom (number of parameters) requires a smaller dataset to train [16], and size of the training set is often a limiting factor in neural network training.\nIntuitively, the reason for a smaller and deeper network to be more effective than an equally sized (in total nodes) shallower network is that a deep network reduces the amount of redundant work done.\nAs an example, suppose we are given bitmap images containing triangles, rectangles, pentagons, and hexagons, and our task is to count the number of each shape in each image. In the case of a deep network, the first layers can perform the low level task of calculating image gradients and identifying lines in the image, and transform it to a more convenient form. Higher layers can then perform classification and counting from the simpler representation.\nOn the other hand, if we have a shallow network, the low level tasks would have to be performed multiple times, since there is little cross-feeding of intermediate results. This would result in a lot of redundant work done.\nWith very deep networks, it is possible to model functions that work with many layers of abstraction - for example, classifying the gender of images of faces, or the breed of dogs. It is not practical to perform these tasks using shallow networks, because the redundant work done is exponential to the number of layers, and an equivalent shallow network would require exponentially more computational power, and exponentially larger training sets, neither of which are usually available."

      "text" : "The fact that deeper networks are more computationally efficient has been known for a very long time, and deep networks have been attempted as early as 1980 [17]. In 1989, LeCun et al. successfully applied a 3-hidden-layer network to ZIP code recognition. However, they were not able to scale to higher number of layers or more complex problems due to very slow training, the reason of which was not understood.\nIn 1991, Hochreiter identified the problem and called it ”vanishing gradients” [18, 19]. Essentially,\nwhat’s happening is as errors are propagated back from the output layer, it’s multiplied by derivatives of the activation function at the point of activation. As soon as the propagation gets to a node in saturation (where derivative is close to 0), the error is reduced to the level of noise, and nodes behind the saturated node train extremely slowly. No effective solution to the problem was found for many years.\nResearchers continued to try to build deep networks, but with often disappointing performance."

      "text" : "In 2007, Hinton proposed a solution to the problem, and started the current wave of renewed interest in deep learning. The idea is to first train each layer in an unsupervised and greedy fashion, to try to identify application-independent features from each layer, before finally training the entire network on labeled data [20].\nThe way he implemented the idea is with a generative model, in the form of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), where each layer contains a set of binary variables with associated probability distributions, and each layer is trained to predict the previous layer using an algorithm known as contrastive divergence [20].\nAnother idea in the same vein is to use a neural network to reproduce the original input [21], which allows the reuse of all the neural network techniques that have already been developed (unlike for RBM).\nThe idea is to first start with just the input layer and one hidden layer, and train the network (using standard back-propagation gradient descent) to produce the original input, essentially training the network to model the identity function [21]. If the hidden layer has fewer nodes than the input layer, the output of the hidden layer is then a compressed and more abstract representation of the input. This process is repeated to train each hidden layer, with the output of the previous layer as the input [21]. The final network can then be trained with the actual output layer using standard back-propagation from labeled data. This works around the vanishing gradient problem because when the final back-propagation is performed, most of the earlier layers are already trained to provide application-independent abstractions.\nIn modern implementations, some artificial noise is often injected into the input of autoencoders to encourage robustness in the autoencoders, by testing their ability to reconstruct clean input from partially-corrupted input [21]. These autoencoders are known as denoising autoencoders. Denoising autoencoders perform similarly to systems based on RBMs and their stacked variant - Deep Belief Networks (DBN) [21]."

      "heading" : "3.2.2 Solution 2: Rectified Linear Activation Units",
      "text" : "In 2011, a simpler solution to the vanishing gradients problem was proposed by Glorot et al. Their solution to the vanishing gradients problem is to simply use an activation function that does not reduce the error as it’s propagated back [12].\nThe proposed function is the rectified linear activation function (ReLU), y = max(0, x) [12]. See Figure 1 for a comparison of the three activation functions.\nIn the activated region (x > 0), the derivative is 1, and in the deactivated region (x <= 0), the derivative is 0. It doesn’t change error signals as they are passed through.\nAt first glance it seems like a strange choice for an activation function, for 2 reasons -\n• It is not differentiable at zero\n• It is unbounded on the positive side\nThe non-differentiability at zero is inconsequential, since neural networks work in real numbers, it is highly unlikely that it will be at exactly x = 0 at any time. In practice, we define the derivative at zero to either be 0 or 1, and it doesn’t have any real world effect.\nThe unbounded nature of the function on the positive side is more problematic, because they can result in very large activations in later layers, which may cause numerical problems. This can be solved using L1 regularization, which not only limits the magnitude of weights, but also enforces sparsity [12].\nA sparse network is one where for any given input, only a small subset of nodes will be activated. The fact that L1 and L12 regularization encourage sparsity is in contrast to L2 regularization which discourages sparsity. L2 regularization encourages the desired output to be constructed from many small weights (which would have a lower L2 norm) instead of one large weight, which would have a higher L2 norm, but equal L1 norm, and lower L12 norm, as shown in Figure 2. In essence, L1 and L 1 2 regularization encourage nodes to be independent from one another, and not co-evolve with others. This can result in more efficient usage of available nodes, and also have computational advantages in networks using activation functions with a hard 0 saturation (such as the rectified linear activation) [12], since if a node’s output is 0, it does not need to be broadcasted to nodes in the next layer.\nWith rectified linear activation, L1 regularization, and no pre-training, Glorot et al. reports achieving slightly superior or similar performance to previous results based on pre-training [12].\nOne possible reason for the increase in performance is more efficient use of nodes. With a pre-training\nsystem, nodes are trained to extract all discriminating patterns from the input data, even if some of those patterns are irrelevant for the task at hand. Without pre-training, those irrelevant patterns would not be encoded, thus freeing up the nodes for more important patterns for the task.\nHowever, he also identified one situation where pre-training is still advantageous - for semi-supervised problems. In a semi-supervised problem, a large training set is available, but only a small subset is labeled. In this case, starting with pre-training using the entire dataset before training the whole network with the labeled subset can result in a network that generalizes better [12].\nFor purely-supervised problems, most researchers have abandoned the pre-training idea, and adopted ReLU + L1 regularization instead.\nThere is not sufficient research to decide whether ReLU is also superior to traditional activation functions in shallower networks. Most shallow networks still use hyperbolic tangent or logistic activation, because they are not affected by the vanishing gradient problem."

      "heading" : "3.3 DropOut",
      "text" : "In 2012, Hinton et al. proposed a technique that greatly improves network performance in cases where there is limited training data [22]. The idea stems from the observation that when the training set is small, there will be many possible models that will perform well on the training set, but only some will perform well on the testing set.\nThe traditional solution to this is to train an ensemble of networks from different initialization and/or subsets of the training set, then combine their outputs to produce the final output (often by averaging, or voting) [23]. This approach is known to work well in improving model performance, but it is often not computationally feasible in deep learning, where training a single network can take many hours or days even on a fast GPU. Many trained neural networks are also used in real-time applications, and using an ensemble would make the model many times slower to evaluate.\nHinton et al.’s proposal, termed ”DropOut”, is to randomly de-activate 50% of the nodes of a network on each training iteration. A disabled node would not participate in forward propagation (where they would output 0), and would block any error signal from propagating through the node during backpropagation. When training is done, all nodes are re-enabled, but all weights are halved to maintain the same output range [22].\nThey were able to achieve similar results as ensembles of large numbers of networks, with only about 2× the computational power requirement of a single network. They hypothesized that this is because disabling 50% of nodes at random on each iteration forces nodes to independently evolve, instead of co-evolving with others. Co-evolution is not optimal because, for example, some nodes can evolve to correct mistakes made by other nodes, instead of modeling useful patterns. In DropOut, nodes cannot assume other nodes exist, and are forced to be ”independently useful” [22]."

This is especially true for problems with small labeled datasets, where single networks are likely to overfit.\nBucilua et al. proposed that for semi-supervised problems, where a large dataset is available but only a small subset is labeled, it may be beneficial to train an ensemble (or another slow and accurate model) on the labeled subset, and use it to label all data, before finally training a single network (or\nanother fast model) on the entire dataset, to reproduce both the original labels and the labels added by the ensemble [24].\nIn applications where there is a shortage of both labeled and unlabeled data, the training set can be artificially augmented. Training set augmentation is application-specific. For example, in computer vision applications where the network should be translationally and rotationally invariant, additional training entries can be formed by translating or rotating images from the original training set [25]."

In case of classification problems where the output layer is often softmax, the ”extended labels” are inputs to the softmax layer [26]. The inputs to the softmax layer are log probabilities of each class.\nFinally, a shallow network can be trained to predict the log probabilities, instead of the original single-class label. This makes training much easier for the shallow network, because multi-class log probabilities labels provide much more information than a single-class label. By modelling the log probabilities, the shallow network is also mimic-ing how the deep net (or ensemble) will generalize to unseen data, which mostly depend on the relative values of log probabilities for classes that are not the highest [26]. The performances of these shallow networks are much higher than networks trained on the single-class labels.\nThis result is significant because it proves that the reason why shallow networks perform worse than deep networks is not entirely due to the increase in representative power and flexibility of deep networks. It is also due to our current training algorithms being sub-optimal for shallow networks, and if we can develop better training algorithms, we can potentially significantly improve the performance of shallow networks.\nHowever, the performance of these mimic-ing shallow networks are still not quite as good as the deep networks or ensembles they are mimic-ing [26]. Therefore, the option of creating a mimic-ing shallow network allows a tradeoff to be made between accuracy and speed."

      "text" : "Convolutional neural networks are a neural network architecture that uses extensive weight-sharing to reduce the degrees of freedom of models that operate on features that are spatially-correlated [17]. This includes 2D and 3D images (and 2D videos, which can be seen as 3D images), but it has also very recently been successfully applied to natural language processing [27].\nConvolutional neural networks are inspired by the observation that for inputs like images (with each pixel being an input dimension), many low level operations are local, and they are not positiondependent [17]. For example, one operation that is useful in many computer vision applications is edge detection. In a fully-connected deep network, the edge detector would have to be separately trained for each part of the image, even though they would most likely all arrive at similar results. It would be better if a kernel can be trained to do edge detection for the entire image at the same time.\nIn its current iteration, convolutional neural networks are composed of 3 different types of layers -\nconvolutional, max-pooling, and fully-connected [2]. One typical arrangement is alternating between convolutional and maxpooling layers, before finishing off with 2 fully-connected hidden layers.\nEach convolutional layer has the same dimensions as the input, but each pixel is only activated by a region of pixels centered around the pixels at the same location in the input images. The weights are also shared for each output pixel. In effect, each map in a convolutional layer performs a convolution of the input images, with a learned kernel.\nMax-pooling layers perform downsampling on the images. One typical downsample factor is 2x2 (dividing both width and height by 2). While averaging can also be used, empirical results suggest that downsampling by taking the maximum in each sub-region gives the best performance in most cases [28]. Max-pooling is responsible for summarizing each sub-region, and it gives the network some translational and rotational invariance.\nFully-connected layers are often used as final layers to encode position-dependent information and more global patterns.\nMost existing applications of convolutional neural networks are on 2D images, but the idea can also be extended to 3D, with 3D images and 3D kernels. It can be used to process actual 3D images (eg. MR Images), or videos, using time as the third dimension."

A reduction in hippocampal volume can be used as a marker for AD diagnosis [30].\nHumans have 2 hippocampi, shaped like seahorses, as shown in Figure 3. Our goal is to classify each voxel in an MR Image as non-hippocampus, left hippocampus, or right hippocampus.

We enlarged the region by 0.03 on each side, and use (0.39 < x < 0.84, 0.27 < y < 0.70, 0.19 < z < 0.83) as the mask. All voxels outside of the mask are automatically classified as non-hippocampus.

Another problem is that edge voxels (voxels at the edges between positive and negative voxels) would be severely under-represented, even though they will most likely be the most difficult voxels to classify.\nTherefore, we draw samples as follows -\n• For 50% of the samples, we keep drawing randomly until we get a voxel where the 5x5x5 bounding box around the voxel contains more than 1 class\n• For 25% of the samples, we keep drawing randomly until we get a positive voxel\n• For the remaining 25% of the samples, we keep drawing randomly until we get a negative voxel\nThis drawing scheme ensures that none of the important types of voxels are under-represented.

As shown in Table 1, there are very clear improvements going from 1 to 3 layers, but there are no clear improvements beyond 3 layers. However, we also note that number of layers has little impact on speed in terms of time per iteration.\nAll labeling results are on one of the images in the testing set, with 1755 positive voxels, and 1393947 negative voxels. All false positive and false negative values are after post-processing, and since the total number of positive and negative voxels are the same, the false positive and false negative values are directly comparable between runs.

As shown in Table 2, there are little benefits in going beyond 24x24. However, in this case, training becomes much slower for larger patch sizes (in time per iteration). Therefore, the optimal patch size seems to be 24x24.\nNext, we experiment with patch size for the tri-planar architecture, and see similar results, with the optimal patch size being 24x24, as shown in Table 3. There are also very significant reductions in training speed as patch size is increased.\nFinally, we look at patch sizes for the 3D architecture. Unfortunately, we are constrained by available GPU memory in this case, and can only use up to 20x20x20 patches. We find that unlike the previous two architectures, the 3D architecture performs well even at a very small patch size of 12x12x12, and it is not clear whether it actually benefits from having larger patches, as shown in Table 4.\nFrom the above experiments, we selected 3 configurations to investigate further -\n• 2D 24x24, 7 layers\n• Tri-planar 24x24\n• 3D 20x20x20\nWe run each configuration five times to see how consistent they are. The networks are initialized with different random seeds each time, but trained on the same training sets. Results are presented in Table 5.\nWhile the results on the validation and testing sets are reasonably consistent between each run of the same configuration, the actual labeling performance on an entire image is much less consistent. This can be due to the fact that the class distribution in the patches used for the training/validation/testing sets are not the same as the distribution in an actual image. The discrepancy in image labeling performance could be because some models do better at classifying some classes than others, and those classes are more common in an actual image.\nFrom the perspective of speed-accuracy tradeoffs, the 2D architecture is clearly the least accurate, but also the fastest to train at approximately 754 iterations per minute.\nThe tri-planar architecture has clearly better performance than 2D, and can be trained at approximately 221 iterations per minute.\nThe 3D architecture performs consistently better than the tri-planar architecture in classifying patches, but that advantage does not seem to translate well to image labeling performance, where it seems to perform slightly worse. It is also the slowest to train at approximately 95 iterations per minute, with the longest run taking more than 5 hours to train."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text" : "In this project we investigated the use of three different convolutional network architectures for patchbased segmentation of the hippocampi region in MRI images. We discovered that the popular triplanar approach offers a good tradeoff between accuracy and training time. While the 3D approach performs marginally better at patch classification, it does not seem to perform as well at labeling an entire image. This is most likely due to the sampling method altering prior probabilities of the classes\npresented to the training algorithm, and if this problem is solved, the 3D approach should perform marginally better than the tri-planar approach in whole-image labeling as well, but with a much higher computational power requirement.\nThere are many possible avenues for future investigation. For example, there are learning rate scheduling algorithms available that may significantly shorten training time without affecting quality of results, such as Zeiler’s famous ADADELTA algorithm [35], which assigns an independent learning rate to each weight depending on how often they are activated, so that while some oft-used connections can have slower learning rates to achieve higher precision, rarely-used connections can still be trained at a higher learning rate to reduce bias.\nIt may also be beneficial to give the coordinate of each patch (within the mask) to the fully-connected layers of the neural networks, along with the prior probability of each class at that coordinate, determined by statistical analysis on the training set.\nOne possible extension to the tri-planar architecture is to include images at multiple scales for each plane, similarly to how it was applied to traffic sign recognition by Sermanet and LeCun [36]. This would allow the networks to have more global context, and if the largest scales are big enough to include boundaries of the brain, it may compensate for the lack of positional information in the triplanar architecture. This can either be an alternative to, or complement, the idea of giving statistical coordinate-based prior probabilities to the network."

We also examined the popular ”tri-planar” approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement. ar X iv :1 50 5. 02 00 0v 1 [ cs .L G ] 8 M ay 2 01 5",
