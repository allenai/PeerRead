A new sparsity function is imposed on the extracted featuremap to capture the structure and shape of the learned object, extracting interpretable features to improve the prediction performance.

      "text" : "Convolutional net (Convnet) LeCun et al. (1998) have shown to be powerful models in extracting rich features from high-dimensional images. They employ hierarchical layers of combined convolution and pooling to extract compressed features that capture the intra-class variations between images. The purpose of applying pooling over neighbor activations in featuremaps of Convnet is to break the spatial correlation of neighboring pixels, and to improve the scale and translation invariant features learned by Convnet. This also helps in learning filters for generic feature extraction of lowmid-high level of concepts, such as edge detectors, geometric shapes, and object class Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Donahue et al. (2013); Zeiler et al. (2010); Zeiler & Fergus (2014).\nSeveral regularization techniques have been proposed to improve feature extraction in Counvnet and to overcome overfitting in large deep networks with many parameters. A dropout technique in Srivastava et al. (2014) is based on randomly dropping hidden units with its connnection during training to avoid co-adaptaion or redundant filter training. This method resemble averaging over ensemble of sub-models, where each sub-model is trained based on a subset of parameters. A maxout neuron is proposed in Goodfellow et al. (2013b) while a maxout neuron, with the maximum of activity across featuremaps is computed in Counvnets. Maxout networks have shown to improve the classification performance by building a convex an unbounded activation function, which prevents learning dead filters. A winner-take-all method is employed in Makhzani & Frey (2014) to reduce or eliminate redundant and delta type filters in pretraining of Counvnet using Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE), by taking the maximum activity inside featuremap in each training step.\nSparse feature learning is a common method for compressed feature extraction in shallow encoderdecoder-based networks, i.e. in sparse coding Hoyer (2002; 2004); Olshausen et al. (1996); Olshausen & Field (1997), in Autoencoders (AE) Ng (2011), and in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) Poultney et al. (2006); Ranzato et al. (2007). Bach et al. Bach et al. (2012) organize `1 sparsity in a structured form to capture interpretable features and improve prediction performance of the model. In this paper, we present a novel Structured Model of sparse feature extraction in CAE that improves the performance of feature extraction by regularizing the distribution of activities inside and across featuremaps. We employ the idea of sparse filtering Ngiam et al. (2011) to regularize the activity across featuremaps and to improve sparsity within and across featuremaps. The proposed model is using `2 and `1 normalization on the featuremap activations to implement part-based feature extraction.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n04 81\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n7 A\npr 2\n01 6"

      "text" : "In this section, the model of Structured Sparse CAE (SSCAE) is described. CAE consists of convolution/pooling/nonlinearity based encoding and decoding layers, where the feature vector is represented as featuremaps, i.e. hidden output of the encoding layer.\nIn CAE with n encoding filters, the featuremaps hk∈n are computed based on a convolution/pooling/nonlinearity layer, with nonlinear function applied on the pooled activation of convolution layer, as in Eq. 1.\nhk∈n = f(x ∗Wk∈n + bk∈n) (1) where Wk∈n and bk∈n are the filter and bias of k-th featuremap, respectively. We refer to hkij as\nsingle neuron activity in k-th featuremap hk, whereas hij = [ hkij ]k∈n\nis defined as a feature vector across featuremaps hk∈n as illustrated in Fig. 1.\nIn SSCAE, the featuremaps hk∈n are reqularized and sparsified to represent three properties; (i) Sparse feature vector hij ; (ii) Sparse neuronal activity hkij within each of the k-th featuremap h\nk; (iii)Uniform distribution of feature vectors hij .\nIn (i), sparsity is imposed on feature vector hij to increase diversity of features represented by each featuremap, i.e. each hk∈n should represent a distinguished and discriminative characteristic of the input, such as different parts, edges, etc. This property is exemplified in Fig. 1(b) with digits decomposed into parts across featuremaps hk∈n. As stipulated in (ii), sparsity is imposed on each featuremap hk∈n to only contain few non-zero activities hkij . This property is encouraged for each featuremap to represent a localized feature of the input. Fig. 1(b) shows property (i) for MNIST dataset, where each featuremap is a localized feature of a digit, wherein Fig. 1(a) shows extracted digit shape-resemblance featurs, a much less successful and non-sparse outcome compared to Fig. 1(b). Fig. 2 also depicts the technique for numerical sparsification of each featuremap. The property (iii) is imposed on activation features hij to have similar statistics with uniform activity. In other words, hij will be of nearly equal or uniform activity level, if they lie in the object spatial region, or non-active, if not. Uniform activity also improves the generic and part-based feature extraction where the contributing activation features hij of digits, i.e. hij , fall within convolutional region of digits and filters Wk∈n show uniform activity level, which results in generic and partbased features.\nTo enforce the aformentioned sparsity properties in CAE models, we have used the combination of `2 and `1 normalization on hk∈n of Eq. 1, as proposed in Ngiam et al. (2011), and as shown in Fig. 3. In SSCAE, a normalization layer is added on the encoding layer, where the normalized featuremaps h̃k∈n and feature vectors h̃ij are imposed by two `2-normalization steps, as in Eq.3 and Eq. 2, respectively,\nĥij = hij\n‖ hij ‖2 (2)\nh̃k = ĥk\n‖ ĥk ‖2 (3)\nThe final normalized featuremaps h̃k∈n are forwarded as inputs to the decoding layer of unpooling/deconvolution/nonlinearity to reconstruct the input x as in Eq. 4,\nx̃ = f( ∑ k∈n h̃k ∗Pk + ck) (4)\nwhere Pk and ck are the filters and biases of decoding layer. In order to enforce the sparsity properties of (i)-(iii), the `1 sparsity is applied on h̃k∈n as in Eq. 6, where the averaged `1 sparsity over n featuremaps and m training data is minimized during the reconstruction of input x, as in Eq’s. 5, 6 and 7,\nLL2rec =‖ x− x̃ ‖2 (5)\nLL1sp = 1\nm\n1\nn ∑ d∈m ∑ k∈n ‖ h̃k ‖1 (6)\nLSSCAE = LL2rec + λL1spLL1sp (7) where LL2rec, LL1sp and LSSCAE are the reconstruction, sparsity and SSCAE loss functions, respectively. λL1sp indicates the sparsity penalty on h̃k∈n and h̃ij . Fig. 2 demonstrate the steps of normalization and sparsification by selected feature maps of MNIST data."

To show the performance of structured sparsity on reconstruction, a small CAE with 8 filters is trained on SVHN dataset. Fig. 6(a) shows the performance of CAE after training which fails to extract edge-like filters and results in poor reconstruction. Fig. 8 also depicts the learnt 16 encoding and decoding filters on small NORB dataset, where structured sparsity improve the extraction of localized and edgelike filters. However, SSCAE outperform CAE in reconstruction due to learnt edge-like filters. The selected featuremap of the two models are shown in Fig. 7(a)(b). The convergence rate of reconstruction optimization for CAE and SSCAE is also compared on MNIST (Fig. 5(a)), SVHN (Fig. 5(b)), small NORB (Fig. 5(c)), and CIFAR-10 (Fig. 5(d)) datasets, which indicate faster convergence in SSCAE."

(2013b) while a maxout neuron, with the maximum of activity across featuremaps is computed in Counvnets. Maxout networks have shown to improve the classification performance by building a convex an unbounded activation function, which prevents learning dead filters. A winner-take-all method is employed in Makhzani & Frey (2014) to reduce or eliminate redundant and delta type filters in pretraining of Counvnet using Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE), by taking the maximum activity inside featuremap in each training step. Sparse feature learning is a common method for compressed feature extraction in shallow encoderdecoder-based networks, i.e. in sparse coding Hoyer (2002; 2004); Olshausen et al. (1996); Olshausen & Field (1997), in Autoencoders (AE) Ng (2011), and in Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) Poultney et al. (2006); Ranzato et al. (2007). Bach et al.",
