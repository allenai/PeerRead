      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nOne way to solve Markov decision processes (MDPs) is to compute the state-action value function from which the optimal policy can be extracted. The value function can be represented as a matrix where each entry corresponds to the value for a state-action pair. For practical MDPs, data encoding the value function routinely lie in millions or even billions of dimensions. The ability to accurately represent this data on a compact basis would presumably have an impact on a wide area of disciplines that rely on stochastic decision making, including robotics, automated control, economics, and manufacturing. We consider the problem of compactly approximating an MDP state-action value function. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality and scale,1 we must leverage on the fact that the value functions have low intrinsic dimensionality. That is, they lie on some low-dimensional subspace [1], are sparse in some basis [2], or lie on some low-dimensional manifold [3], [4]. The foundation of our approach is similar to that in value function approximation in reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, researchers have employed a wide variety of basis function schemes to approximate value functions, most commonly radial basis functions and CMACs [5]. Implicit in these methods is the assumption that the value functions can be captured accurately by a small set of features; i.e., an intrinsic assumption about low-dimensionality. In our problem, we decompose a data matrix formed by the state-action values as a low-rank part plus a residual, which is not necessarily sparse (as we would like). The data matrix is thus modeled as a superposition of a lowrank component and a sparse component. This is posed as a matrix decomposition problem under the broader framework of Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In general,\n1H. Y. Ong is with the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA haoyi@stanford.edu\n1We refer to either the complexity of algorithms that increases drastically as dimension increases, or to their performance that decreases sharply when scale goes up.\naccurate decomposition of a matrix is impossible; but the knowledge that the matrix has low rank radically changes this premise, making the search for solutions meaningful [6], [7]. As far as the author knows, this is a novel application of Robust PCA to value function approximation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the mathematical formulation of our problem, followed by Section III, which presents an approach for Robust PCA. Section IV validates our approach through several numerical experiments, and Section V concludes with a few remarks on future work.\nII. VALUE FUNCTION DECOMPOSITION\nWe begin with a brief review on MDPs followed by an abstract definition of the decomposition problem."

The agent then receives reward rt , and the state evolves probabilistically based on the current stateaction pair. The explicit assumption that the next state only depends on the current state-action pair is referred to as the Markov assumption. An MDP can be defined by the tuple .S;A;T;R/, where S and A are the sets of all possible states and actions, respectively, T is a probabilistic transition function, and R is a reward function. T gives the probability of transitioning into state s0 from taking action a at the current state s, and is often denoted T .s;a;s0/. R gives a scalar value indicating the immediate reward received for taking action a at the current state s and is denoted R.s;a/. To solve an MDP, we compute a policy ? that, if followed, maximizes the expected sum of immediate rewards from any given state.

In particular, all that PCP requires about L0 is that its singular vectors are not spiky; i.e., the `1-norm of any singular vector is not too large. To avoid any ambiguity, our model for S0 is this: take an arbitrary matrix S and set to zero its entries on a random set; this gives S0.\nB. Identifiability of low-rank and sparse components\nTo make the problem of matrix decomposition meaningful, we impose that the low-rank component L0 is not sparse. We consider the general notion of incoherence introduced in [13] for the matrix completion problem; this assumption concerns the singular vectors of the low-rank component. We write the singular value decomposition of L0 2 Rm n as\nL0 D U˙V T D rX iD1 iuiv T i ;\nwhere r is the rank of the matrix, 1; : : : ; r are the positive singular values, and U D Œu1; : : : ;ur , V D Œv1; : : : ;vr are the matrices of the left- and right-singular vectors. The incoherence condition with parameter states that\nmax i U T ei 2 2 r m ; max i V T ei 2 2 r n ; (3)\nand UV T 1 r r mn : (4)\nAbove, we define k k1, i.e., the `1 norm of a matrix seen as a long vector. As discussed in [6], [13], [14], the incoherence condition asserts that for small values of , the singular vectors are not spread out; i.e., not sparse. Another issue is if the sparse matrix has low-rank. This will occur if, say, all the nonzero entries of S occur in a column or in a few columns. Consider the case where the first column of S0 is the opposite of that of L0, and where all the other columns of S0 vanish. Then it is clear that we would not be able to recover L0 and S0 since M DL0CS0 would have a column space equal to or included in that of L0. To avoid such situations, we will assume that the sparsity pattern of the sparse component is selected uniformly at random."

      "text" : "For small problem sizes, say maxfm;ng < 100, PCP can be performed using off-the-shelf tools such as interior point methods [15]. This was suggested for low-rank and sparse decomposition in [14]. However, despite their superior convergence rates, interior point methods are limited by the O m6 complexity of computing a step direction. More sophisticated methods with better complexity and convergence rates include iterative thresholding methods using continuation techniques [16], [17], Bregman iterations [18], and Nesterov’s optimal first-order algorithm for smooth and nonsmooth minimization [19]–[21]. An Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) algorithm was suggested for low-rank and sparse decomposition in [22]. APG inherits the optimal O 1=k2 convergence rate for this class of problems, and empirical evidence suggests that it can solve the convex PCP problem at least 50 times faster than straightforward iterative thresholding. Despite its good convergence guarantees, however, the practical performance of APG does not show good accuracy and convergence across a wide variety of problem settings [23]. In this paper, we choose to instead solve the convex PCP problem Eq. (1) using an augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithm introduced in [23], [24]. [12] reports that ALM achieves much higher accuracy than APG, in fewer iterations, and that it works stably across a wide range of problem settings with no parameter tuning. The ALM method operates on the augmented Lagrangian\nL.L;S;Y /D kLk C kSk1ChY;M L Si\nC 2 kM L Sk2F ;\nwhere h i denotes the standard trace inner product.

Under minimal assumptions, this Robust PCA problem can be solved exactly via the Principal Component Pursuit convex optimization problem. We experiment the procedure on several examples and demonstrate that our method yields approximations essentially identical to the true function.",
