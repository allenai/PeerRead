      "text" : "The explosion of the Internet clearly warrants the development of techniques for organizing and presenting information to users in an effective way. Query-focused multi-document summarization (MDS) methods have been proposed as one such technique and have attracted significant attention in recent years. The goal of query-focused MDS is to synthesize a brief (often fixed-length) and well-organized summary from a set of topicrelated documents that answer a complex question or address a topic statement. The resulting summaries, in turn, can support a number of information analysis applications including openended question answering, recommender systems, and summarization of search engine results. As further evidence of its importance, the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) has used queryfocused MDS as its main task since 2004 to foster\nnew research on automatic summarization in the context of users’ needs.\nTo date, most top-performing systems for multi-document summarization—whether queryspecific or not—remain largely extractive: their summaries are comprised exclusively of sentences selected directly from the documents to be summarized (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Haghighi and Vanderwende, 2009; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tür, 2011). Despite their simplicity, extractive approaches have some disadvantages. First, lengthy sentences that are partly relevant are either excluded from the summary or (if selected) can block the selection of other important sentences, due to summary length constraints. In addition, when people write summaries, they tend to abstract the content and seldom use entire sentences taken verbatim from the original documents. In news articles, for example, most sentences are lengthy and contain both potentially useful information for a summary as well as unnecessary details that are better omitted. Consider the following DUC query as input for a MDS system:1 “In what ways have stolen artworks been recovered? How often are suspects arrested or prosecuted for the thefts?” One manually generated summary includes the following sentence but removes the bracketed words in gray:\nA man suspected of stealing a million-dollar collection\nof [hundreds of ancient] Nepalese and Tibetan art objects in\nNew York [11 years ago] was arrested [Thursday at his South\nLos Angeles home, where he had been hiding the antiquities,\npolice said].\nIn this example, the compressed sentence is rela-\n1From DUC 2005, query for topic d422g.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n07 54\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 Ju\nn 20\n16\ntively more succinct and readable than the original (e.g. in terms of Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease Score (Kincaid et al., 1975)). Likewise, removing information irrelevant to the query (e.g. “11 years ago”, “police said”) is crucial for query-focused MDS.\nSentence compression techniques (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Clarke and Lapata, 2008) are the standard for producing a compact and grammatical version of a sentence while preserving relevance, and prior research (e.g. Lin (2003)) has demonstrated their potential usefulness for generic document summarization. Similarly, strides have been made to incorporate sentence compression into query-focused MDS systems (Zajic et al., 2006). Most attempts, however, fail to produce better results than those of the best systems built on pure extraction-based approaches that use no sentence compression.\nIn this paper we investigate the role of sentence compression techniques for query-focused MDS. We extend existing work in the area first by investigating the role of learning-based sentence compression techniques. In addition, we design three types of approaches to sentence-compression— rule-based, sequence-based and tree-based—and examine them within our compression-based framework for query-specific MDS. Our topperforming sentence compression algorithm incorporates measures of query relevance, content importance, redundancy and language quality, among others. Our tree-based methods rely on a scoring function that allows for easy and flexible tailoring of sentence compression to the summarization task, ultimately resulting in significant improvements for MDS, while at the same time remaining competitive with existing methods in terms of sentence compression, as discussed next.\nWe evaluate the summarization models on the standard Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2006 and 2007 corpora 2 for queryfocused MDS and find that all of our compressionbased summarization models achieve statistically significantly better performance than the best DUC 2006 systems. Our best-performing system yields an 11.02 ROUGE-2 score (Lin and Hovy, 2003), a 8.0% improvement over the best reported score (10.2 (Davis et al., 2012)) on the\n2We believe that we can easily adapt our system for tasks (e.g. TAC-08’s opinion summarization or TAC-09’s update summarization) or domains (e.g. web pages or wikipedia pages). We reserve that for future work.\nDUC 2006 dataset, and an 13.49 ROUGE-2, a 5.4% improvement over the best score in DUC 2007 (12.8 (Davis et al., 2012)). We also observe substantial improvements over previous systems w.r.t. the manual Pyramid (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) evaluation measure (26.4 vs. 22.9 (Jagarlamudi et al., 2006)); human annotators furthermore rate our system-generated summaries as having less redundancy and comparable quality w.r.t. other linguistic quality metrics. With these results we believe we are the first to successfully show that sentence compression can provide statistically significant improvements over pure extraction-based approaches for queryfocused MDS."

      "text" : "Existing research on query-focused multidocument summarization (MDS) largely relies on extractive approaches, where systems usually take as input a set of documents and select the top relevant sentences for inclusion in the final summary. A wide range of methods have been employed for this task. For unsupervised methods, sentence importance can be estimated by calculating topic signature words (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006), combining query similarity and document centrality within a graph-based model (Otterbacher et al., 2005), or using a Bayesian model with sophisticated inference (Daumé and Marcu, 2006). Davis et al. (2012) first learn the term weights by Latent Semantic Analysis, and then greedily select sentences that cover the maximum combined weights. Supervised approaches have mainly focused on applying discriminative learning for ranking sentences (Fuentes et al., 2007). Lin and Bilmes (2011) use a class of carefully designed submodular functions to reward the diversity of the summaries and select sentences greedily.\nOur work is more related to the less studied area of sentence compression as applied to (single) document summarization. Zajic et al. (2006) tackle the query-focused MDS problem using a compress-first strategy: they develop heuristics to generate multiple alternative compressions of all sentences in the original document; these then become the candidates for extraction. This approach, however, does not outperform some extractionbased approaches. A similar idea has been studied for MDS (Lin, 2003; Gillick and Favre, 2009),\nbut limited improvement is observed over extractive baselines with simple compression rules. Finally, although learning-based compression methods are promising (Martins and Smith, 2009; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al., 2011), it is unclear how well they handle issues of redundancy.\nOur research is also inspired by probabilistic sentence-compression approaches, such as the noisy-channel model (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Turner and Charniak, 2005), and its extension via synchronous context-free grammars (SCFG) (Aho and Ullman, 1969; Lewis and Stearns, 1968) for robust probability estimation (Galley and McKeown, 2007). Rather than attempt to derive a new parse tree like Knight and Marcu (2000) and Galley and McKeown (2007), we learn to safely remove a set of constituents in our parse tree-based compression model while preserving grammatical structure and essential content. Sentence-level compression has also been examined via a discriminative model McDonald (2006), and Clarke and Lapata (2008) also incorporate discourse information by using integer linear programming."

      "heading" : "3 The Framework",
      "text" : "We now present our query-focused MDS framework consisting of three steps: Sentence Ranking, Sentence Compression and Post-processing. First, sentence ranking determines the importance of each sentence given the query. Then, a sentence compressor iteratively generates the most likely succinct versions of the ranked sentences, which are cumulatively added to the summary, until a length limit is reached. Finally, the postprocessing stage applies coreference resolution and sentence reordering to build the summary.\nSentence Ranking. This stage aims to rank sentences in order of relevance to the query. Unsurprisingly, ranking algorithms have been successfully applied to this task. We experimented with two of them – Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Mozer et al., 1997) and LambdaMART (Burges et al., 2007). The former has been used previously for MDS (Ouyang et al., 2011). LambdaMart on the other hand has shown considerable success in information retrieval tasks (Burges, 2010); we are the first to apply it to summarization. For training, we use 40 topics (i.e. queries) from the DUC 2005 corpus (Dang, 2005) along with their manually generated abstracts. As in previous work (Shen and Li,\n2011; Ouyang et al., 2011), we use the ROUGE2 score, which measures bigram overlap between a sentence and the abstracts, as the objective for regression.\nWhile space limitations preclude a longer discussion of the full feature set (ref. Table 1), we describe next the query-relevant features used for sentence ranking as these are the most important for our summarization setting. The goal of this feature subset is to determine the similarity between the query and each candidate sentence. When computing similarity, we remove stopwords as well as the words “discuss, describe, specify, explain, identify, include, involve, note” that are adopted and extended from Conroy et al. (2006). Then we conduct simple query expansion based on the title of the topic and cross-document coreference resolution. Specifically, we first add the words from the topic title to the query. And for each mention in the query, we add other mentions within the set of documents that corefer with this mention. Finally, we compute two versions of the features—one based on the original query and another on the expanded one. We also derive the semantic role overlap and relation instance overlap between the query and each sentence. Crossdocument coreference resolution, semantic role labeling and relation extraction are accomplished via the methods described in Section 5.\nSentence Compression. As the main focus of this paper, we propose three types of compression methods, described in detail in Section 4 below.\nPost-processing. Post-processing performs coreference resolution and sentence ordering.\nWe replace each pronoun with its referent unless they appear in the same sentence. For sentence ordering, each compressed sentence is assigned to the most similar (tf-idf) query sentence. Then a Chronological Ordering algorithm (Barzilay et al., 2002) sorts the sentences for each query based first on the time stamp, and then the position in the source document."

In contrast, however, we\nview compression as a sequential tagging problem and make use of linear-chain Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) to select the most likely compression. We represent each sentence as a sequence of tokens, X = x0x1 . . . xn, and generate a sequence of labels, Y = y0y1 . . . yn, that encode which tokens are kept, using a BIO label format: {B-RETAIN denotes the beginning of a retained sequence, IRETAIN indicates tokens “inside” the retained sequence, O marks tokens to be removed}.\nThe CRF model is built using the features shown in Table 3. “Dependency Tree Features” encode the grammatical relations in which each word is involved as a dependent. For the “Syntactic Tree”, “Dependency Tree” and “Rule-Based” features, we also include features for the two words that precede and the two that follow the current word. Detailed descriptions of the training data and experimental setup are in Section 5.\nDuring inference, we find the maximally likely sequence Y according to a CRF with parameter θ (Y = argmaxY ′ P (Y ′|X; θ)), while simultaneously enforcing the rules of Table 2 to reduce the hypothesis space and encourage grammatical compression. To do this, we encode these rules as features for each token, and whenever these feature functions fire, we restrict the possible label for that token to “O”."

      "heading" : "4.3 Tree-based Compression",
      "text" : "Our tree-based compression methods are in line with syntax-driven approaches (Galley and McKeown, 2007), where operations are carried out on parse tree constituents. Unlike previous work (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Galley and McKeown, 2007), we do not produce a new parse tree,\nbut focus on learning to identify the proper set of constituents to be removed. In particular, when a node is dropped from the tree, all words it subsumes will be deleted from the sentence.\nFormally, given a parse tree T of the sentence to be compressed and a tree traversal algorithm, T can be presented as a list of ordered constituent nodes, T = t0t1 . . . tm. Our objective is to find a set of labels, L = l0l1 . . . lm, where li ∈ {RETAIN, REMOVE, PARTIAL}. RETAIN (RET) and REMOVE (REM) denote whether the node ti is retained or removed. PARTIAL (PAR) means ti is partly removed, i.e. at least one child subtree of ti is dropped.\nLabels are identified, in order, according to the tree traversal algorithm. Every node label needs to be compatible with the labeling history: given a node ti, and a set of labels l0 . . . li−1 predicted for nodes t0 . . . ti−1, li =RET or li =REM is compatible with the history when all children of ti are labeled as RET or REM, respectively; li =PAR is compatible when ti has at least two descendents tj and tk (j < i and k < i), one of which is RETained and the other, REMoved. As such, the root of the gray subtree in Figure 1 is labeled as REM; its left siblings as RET; its parent as PAR.\nAs the space of possible compressions is exponential in the number of leaves in the parse tree, instead of looking for the globally optimal solution, we use beam search to find a set of highly likely compressions and employ a language model trained on a large corpus for evaluation.\nA Beam Search Decoder. The beam search decoder (see Algorithm 1) takes as input the sentence’s parse tree T = t0t1 . . . tm, an ordering O for traversing T (e.g. postorder) as a sequence of nodes in T , the set L of possible node labels, a scoring function S for evaluating each sentence compression hypothesis, and a beam size N . Specifically, O is a permutation on the set {0, 1, . . . ,m}—each element an\nindex onto T . Following O, T is re-ordered as tO0tO1 . . . tOm , and the decoder considers each ordered constituent tOi in turn. In iteration i, all existing sentence compression hypotheses are expanded by one node, tOi , labeling it with all compatible labels. The new hypotheses (usually subsentences) are ranked by the scorer S and the top N are preserved to be extended in the next iteration. See Figure 2 for an example.\nInput : parse tree T , ordering O = O0O1 . . . Om, L ={RET, REM, PAR}, hypothesis scorer S, beam size N Output: N best compressions stack← Φ (empty set); foreach node tOi in T = tO0 . . . tOm do\nif i == 0 (first node visited) then foreach label lO0 in L do\nnewHypothesis h′ ← [lO0 ]; put h′ into Stack;\nend else\nnewStack← Φ (empty set); foreach hypothesis h in stack do\nforeach label lOi in L do if lOi is compatible then\nnewHypothesis h′ ← h + [lOi ]; put h′ into newStack;\nend end\nend stack← newStack;\nend Apply S to sort hypotheses in stack in descending order; Keep the N best hypotheses in stack;\nend\nAlgorithm 1: Beam search decoder.\nOur BASIC Tree-based Compression instantiates the beam search decoder with postorder traversal and a hypothesis scorer that takes a possible sentence compression— a sequence of nodes (e.g. tO0 . . . tOk ) and their labels (e.g. lO0 . . . lOk )—and returns∑k\nj=1 logP (lOj |tOj ) (denoted later as ScoreBasic). The probability is estimated by\na Maximum Entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) trained at the constituent level using the features in Table 4. We also apply the rules of Table 2 during the decoding process. Concretely, if the words subsumed by a node are identified by any rule, we only consider REM as the node’s label.\nGiven the N -best compressions from the decoder, we evaluate the yield of the trimmed trees using a language model trained on the Gigaword (Graff, 2003) corpus and return the compression with the highest probability. Thus, the decoder is quite flexible — its learned scoring function allows us to incorporate features salient for sentence compression while its language model guarantees the linguistic quality of the compressed string. In the sections below we consider additional improvements."

In a nutshell, if the head node is dropped, then its modifiers need not be preserved. We adopt the same features as CONTEXT-aware search, but remove those involving left siblings.

      "text" : "The current scorer ScoreBasic is still fairly naive in that it focuses only on features of the sentence to be compressed. However extra-sentential knowledge can also be important for queryfocused MDS. For example, information regarding relevance to the query might lead the decoder to produce compressions better suited for the summary. Towards this goal, we construct a compression scoring function—the multi-scorer (MULTI)—that allows the incorporation of multiple task-specific scorers. Given a hypothesis at any stage of decoding, which yields a sequence of words W = w0w1...wj , we propose the following component scorers.\nQuery Relevance. Query information ought to guide the compressor to identify the relevant content. The query Q is expanded as described in Section 3. Let |W ∩ Q| denote the number of unique overlapping words betweenW andQ, then scoreq = |W ∩Q|/|W |.\nImportance. A query-independent importance score is defined as the average SumBasic (Toutanova et al., 2007) value in W , i.e. scoreim = ∑j i=1 SumBasic(wi)/|W |.\nLanguage Model. We let scorelm be the probability of W computed by a language model.\nCross-Sentence Redundancy. To encourage diversified content, we define a redundancy score to discount replicated content: scorered = 1− |W ∩ C|/|W |, whereC is the words already selected for the summary.\nThe multi-scorer is defined as a linear combination of the component scorers: Let ~α = (α0, . . . , α4), 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1, −−−→score = (scoreBasic, scoreq, scoreim, scorelm, scorered),\nS = scoremulti = ~α · −−−→score (1)\nThe parameters ~α are tuned on a held-out tuning set by grid search.

This means our systems can effectively remove redundancy within the summary through compression. Furthermore, our HEAD-driven beam search method with MULTI-scorer beats all systems on DUC 20066 and all systems on DUC 2007 except the best system in terms of R-2 (p < 0.01).

The average score and standard deviation for each metric is displayed in Table 6. Our system achieves a higher Pyramid score, an indication that it captures more of the salient facts.

(2006), meaning that human raters perceive less replicative content in our summaries. Scores for other metrics are comparable to Jagarlamudi et al. (2006) and Lacatusu et al. (2006), which either uses minimal non-learning-based compression rules or is a pure extractive system. However, our compression system sometimes generates less grammatical sentences, and those are mostly due to parsing errors. For example, parsing a clause starting with a past tense verb as an adverbial clausal modifier can lead to an ill-formed compression. Those issues can be addressed by analyzing k-best parse trees and we leave it in the future work. A sample summary from our multiscorer based system is in Figure 3.\nSentence Compression Evaluation. We also evaluate sentence compression separately on (Clarke and Lapata, 2008), adopting the same partitions as (Martins and Smith, 2009), i.e. 1, 188 sentences for training and 441 for testing. Our compression models are compared with Hedge Trimmer (Dorr et al., 2003), a discriminative model proposed by McDonald (2006) and a\ndependency-tree based compressor (Martins and Smith, 2009)8. We adopt the metrics in Martins and Smith (2009) to measure the unigram-level macro precision, recall, and F1-measure with respect to human annotated compression. In addition, we also compute the F1 scores of grammatical relations which are annotated by RASP (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) according to Clarke and Lapata (2008).\nIn Table 7, our context-aware and head-driven tree-based compression systems show statistically significantly (p < 0.01) higher precisions (Uni-\n8Thanks to André F.T.

For grammatical relation evaluation, our head-driven tree-based system obtains statistically significantly (p < 0.01) better F1 score (Rel-F1 than all the other systems except the rule-based system)."

Our tree-based compression method can easily incorporate measures of query relevance, content importance, redundancy and language quality into the compression process.

Our best system also yields better results for human evaluation based on Pyramid and achieves comparable linguistic quality scores."

We present a sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions. Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task.",
