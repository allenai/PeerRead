      "text" : "Named entity recognition is an important task in NLP. High performance approaches have been dominated by applying statistical models such as CRF, SVM, or perceptron models to hand-crafted features (Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Passos et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2015). However, Collobert et al. (2011b) proposed an effective neural network model that requires little feature engineering and instead learns important features from word embeddings trained on large quantities of unlabelled text – an approach made possible by recent advancements in unsupervised learning of word embeddings on mas-\nsive amount of data (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Mikolov et al., 2013) and neural network training algorithms permitting deep architectures (Rumelhart et al., 1986).\nUnfortunately there are many limitations to the model proposed by Collobert et al. (2011b). First, it uses a simple feed-forward neural network, which restricts the use of context to a fixed sized window around each word – an approach that discards useful long-distance relations between words. Second, by depending solely on word embeddings, it is unable to exploit explicit character level features such as prefix and suffix, which could be useful especially with rare words where word embeddings are poorly trained. We seek to address these issues by proposing a more powerful neural network model.\nA well-studied solution for a neural network to process variable length input and have long term memory is the recurrent neural network (RNN) (Goller and Kuchler, 1996). Recently, RNNs have shown great success in diverse NLP tasks such as speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013), machine translation (Cho et al., 2014), and language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2011). The long-short term memory (LSTM) unit with the forget gate allows highly non-trivial long-distance dependencies to be easily learned (Gers et al., 2000). For sequential labelling tasks such as NER and speech recognition, a bi-directional LSTM model can take into account an effectively infinite amount of context on both sides of a word and eliminates the problem of limited context that applies to any feed-forward model (Graves et al., 2013). While LSTMs have been studied in the past for the NER task by Hammerton (2003), the lack of computational power (which led to the use of very small models) and quality word embeddings ar X iv :1 51 1.\n08 30\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n6 N\nov 2\n01 5\nlimited their effectiveness. Similarly, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have become very popular in image processing for feature extraction. Recently, dos Santos (2015) and Labeau (2015) successfully employed CNNs to extract character-level features for use in NER and POS-tagging respectively. Collobert et al. (2011b) also applied CNNs to semantic role labeling, and variants of the architecture have been applied to parsing and other tasks requiring tree structures (Blunsom et al., 2014). However, the effectiveness of character-level CNNs has not been evaluated for English NER.\nOur main contribution lies in combining these neural network models for the NER task. We present a hybrid model of bidirectional LSTMs and CNNs that learns both character- and word-level features, presenting the first evaluation of such an architecture on well-established English language evaluation datasets. Furthermore, as lexicons are crucial to NER performance, we propose a new lexicon encoding scheme and matching algorithm that can make use of partial matches, and we compare it to the exact match only approach of Collobert et al. (2011b). Extensive evaluation shows that our proposed method performs competitively on the CoNLL-2003 NER shared task and outperforms all known state-of the-art systems on the OntoNotes 5.0 dataset where significantly more training data is available, albeit with a more complex tagset."

Instead of a feed-forward network, we use the more powerful recurrent neural network; in particular, we choose the bidirectional long-short term memory (LSTM) network, which has been used successfully in other sequence labelling tasks such as speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013). In addition, to induce character-level features, we draw on the idea of using a convolutional neural network, which has been successfully applied to Spanish and Portuguese NER (dos Santos et al., 2015) and German POStagging (Labeau et al., 2015)."

We did not construct separate lexicons for the OntoNotes tagset because correspondences between DBpedia categories and its tags could not be found in many instances. In addition, for each entry we first removed parentheses and all text contained within, then stripped trailing punctuation8, and finally tokenized it with the Penn Treebank tokenization script for the purpose of partial matching. Table 1 shows the size of each category in our lexicon.\nFigure 1 shows an example of how the lexicon features are applied9. For each lexicon category, we match every n-gram (up to the length of the longest lexicon entry) against entries in the lexicon. A match is successful when the n-gram matches the prefix or suffix of an entry and is at least half the length of the entry. Because of the high potential for spurious matches, for all categories except Person, we discard partial matches less than 2 tokens in length. When there are multiple overlap-\n7The Miscellaneous category was populated by entities of the DBpedia categories Artifact and Work.\n8The punctuation stripped was period, comma, semi-colon, colon, forward slash, backward slash, and question mark.\n9As can been seen in this example, the lexicons – in particular Miscellaneous – still contain a lot of noise. Better lexicon construction remains an area of future work.\nping matches within the same category, we prefer exact matches over partial matches, and then longer matches over shorter matches, and finally earlier matches over later matches. All matches are case insensitive.\nFor each token in the match, the feature is encoded in BIOES annotation (Begin, Inside, Outside, End, Single), indicating the position of the token in the matched entry. In other words, the B label will not appear in a suffix-only partial match, and the E label will not appear in a prefix-only partial match.\nAs shown in Table 10, we found that this more sophisticated method outperforms the method presented by Collobert et al. (2011b), which simply uses exact matching and marks tokens with on/off instead of BIOES annotation."

For OntoNotes, GloVe embeddings perform close to Collobert embeddings while Google embeddings are again one point behind. In addition, 300 dimensional embeddings present no significant improvement over 50 dimensional embeddings – a result previously reported by Turian et al. (2010).\nOne possible reason that Collobert embeddings perform better than other publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003 is that they are trained on the Reuters RCV-1 corpus, the source of CoNLL2003 dataset, whereas the other embeddings are not. On the other hand, we suspect that Google’s embeddings perform poorly because of vocabulary mismatch – in particular, Google’s embeddings were trained in a case-sensitive manner, and embeddings for many common punctuations and symbols were not provided. To test these hypotheses, we performed experiments with new word embeddings trained using GloVe and word2vec, with vocabulary list and corpus similar to Collobert et. al. (2011b).\nAs shown in Table 7, our GloVe embeddings improved significantly16 over publicly available embeddings on CoNLL-2003, and our word2vec embeddings improved significantly17 over Google’s embeddings on OntoNotes.\nDue to time constraints we did not perform new hyper-parameter searches with any of the word embeddings. As word embedding quality depends on hyper-parameter choice during their training (Pennington et al., 2014), and also, in our NER neural network, hyper-parameter choice is likely sensitive to the type of word embeddings used, optimizing them all will likely produce better results and provide a fairer comparison of word embedding quality."

Both of them employed the same objective function and similar bidirectional networks, with the former using a Bi-directional LSTM without CNNs and the latter using character-level CNNs with standard RNNs. Our method differs from Huang et al. (2015) in that we employ very little feature engineering and instead take advantage of character level CNNs to automatically extract features from a word. Unlike Labeau et al. (2015), we employed the more powerful LSTM, which we found to outperform standard RNNs in preliminary experimentation as well as being easier to train.

Evaluation of existing word vectors suggests that the domain of training data text is as important as the word vector training algorithm.\nMore effective construction and application of lexicons and word vectors are areas that require more research.
