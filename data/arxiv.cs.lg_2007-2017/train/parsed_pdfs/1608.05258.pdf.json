      "text" : "Submodular functions provide efficient and flexible tools for learning on discrete data. Several common combinatorial optimization tasks, such as clustering, image segmentation, or document summarization, can be achieved by the minimization or the maximization of a submodular function [1, 8, 14]. The key benefit of submodularity is the ability to model notions of diminishing returns, and the availability of exact minimization algorithms and approximate maximization algorithms with precise approximation guarantees [12].\nIn practice, it is not always straightforward to define an appropriate submodular function for a problem at hand. Given fully-labeled data, e.g., images and their foreground/background segmentations in image segmentation, structured-output prediction methods such as the structured-SVM may be used [18]. However, it is common (a) to have missing data, and (b) to embed submodular function minimization within a larger model. These are two situations well tackled by probabilistic modelling.\nLog-supermodular models, with negative log-densities equal to a submodular function, are a first important step toward probabilistic modelling on discrete data with submodular functions [5]. However, it is well known that the log-partition function is intractable in such models. Several bounds have been proposed, that are accompanied with variational approximate inference [6]. These bounds are based on the submodularity of the negative log-densities. However, the parameter learning (typically by maximum likelihood), which is a key feature of probabilistic modeling, has not been tackled yet. We make the following contributions:\n– In Section 3, we review existing variational bounds for the log-partition function and show that the bound of [9], based on “perturb-and-MAP” ideas, formally dominates the bounds proposed by [5, 6].\n– In Section 4.1, we show that for parameter learning via maximum likelihood the existing bound of [5, 6] typically leads to a degenerate solution while the one based on “perturb-and-MAP” ideas and logistic samples [9] does not.\n– In Section 4.2, given that the bound based on “perturb-and-MAP” ideas is an expectation (over our own randomization), we propose to use a stochastic subgradient technique to maximize the lower-bound on the log-likelihood, which can also be extended to conditional maximum likelihood.\n– In Section 5, we illustrate our new results on a set of experiments in binary image denoising, where we highlight the flexibility of a probabilistic model for learning with missing data."

      "text" : "We consider submodular functions on the vertices of the hypercube {0, 1}D. This hypercube representation is equivalent to the power set of {1, . . . , D}. Indeed, we can go from a vertex of the hypercube to a set by looking at the indices of the components equal to one and from set to vertex by taking the indicator vector of the set.\nFor any two vertices of the hypercube, x, y ∈ {0, 1}D, a function f : {0, 1}D → R is submodular if f(x)+f(y) > f(min{x, y})+f(max{x, y}), where the min and max operations are taken componentwise and correspond to the intersection and union of the associated sets. Equivalently, the function x 7→ f(x + ei) − f(x), where ei ∈ RD is the i-th canonical basis vector, is non-increasing. Hence, the notion of diminishing returns is often associated with submodular functions. Most widely used submodular functions are cuts, concave functions of subset cardinality, mutual information, set covers, and certain functions of eigenvalues of submatrices [1, 7]. Supermodular functions are simply negatives of submodular functions.\nIn this paper, we are going to use a few properties of such submodular functions (see [1, 7] and references therein). Any submodular function f can be extended from {0, 1}D to a convex function on RD, which is called the Lovász extension. This extension has the same value on {0, 1}D, hence we use the same notation f . Moreover, this function is convex and piecewise linear, which implies the existence of a polytope B(f) ⊂ RD, called the base polytope, such that for all x ∈ RD, f(x) = maxs∈B(f) x\n⊤s, that is, f is the support function of B(f). The Lovász extension f and the base polytope B(f) have explicit expressions that are, however, not relevant to this paper. We will only use the fact that f can be efficiently minimized on {0, 1}D, by a variety of generic algorithms, or by more efficient dedicated ones for subclasses such as graph-cuts."

Indeed, if {g(y)}y∈{0,1}D is a collection of independent random variables g(y) indexed by y ∈ {0, 1}D, each following the Gumbel distribution, then the random variable maxy∈{0,1}D g(y)− f(y) is such that we have logZ(f) = Eg [ maxy∈{0,1}D {g(y)− f(y)} ]\n[9, Lemma 1].

However, if the base polytope is such that, with high probability ∀d, |sd| ≥ |zd|, then the two bounds are close. Since the logistic distribution is concentrated around zero, we have equality when |sd| is large for all d and s ∈ B(f).\nTheoretical complexity of AL-field and Alogistic. The logistic bound Alogistic can be computed if there is efficient MAP-solver for submodular functions (plus a modular term). In this case, the divide-and-conquer algorithm can be applied for L-Field [5]. Thus, the complexity is dedicated to the minimization of O(|V |) problems. Meanwhile, for the method based on logistic samples, it is necessary to solve M optimization problems. In our empirical bound comparison (next paragraph), running time was the same for both methods. Note however that for parameter learning, we need a single SFM problem per gradient iteration (and not M).\nEmpirical comparison of AL-field and Alogistic. We compare the upper-bounds on the logpartition function AL-field and Alogistic, with the setup used by [5]. We thus consider data from a Gaussian mixture model with 2 clusters in R2. The centers are sampled from N([3, 3], I) and N([−3,−3], I), respectively. Then we sampled n = 50 points for each cluster. Further, these 2n points are used as nodes in a complete weighted graph, where the weight between points x and y is equal to e−c||x−y||.\nWe consider the graph cut function associated to this weighted graph, which defines a logsupermodular distribution. We then consider conditional distributions, one for each k = 1, . . . , n, on the events that at least k points from the first cluster lie on the one side of the cut and at least k points from the second cluster lie on the other side of the cut. For each conditional distribution, we evaluate and compare the two upper bounds.\nIn Figure 1, we show various bounds on A(f) as a function of the number on conditioned pairs. The logistic upper bound is obtained using 100 logistic samples: the logistic upper-bound Alogistic is close to the superdifferential lower bound from [5] and is indeed significantly lower than the bound AL-field."

Indeed, following [9], we consider an exponential family model p(x|t) = exp(−f(x) + s⊤x−A(f − t)), where f − t\nis the function x 7→ f(x)− t⊤x. When f is assumed to be fixed, this can be seen as an exponential family with the base measure exp(−f(x)), sufficient statistics x, and A(f − t) is the log-partition function. It is known that the expectation of the sufficient statistics under the exponential family model Ep(x|t)x is the gradient of the log-partition function [23]. Hence, any approximation of this log-partition gives an approximation of this expectation, which in our situation is the vector of marginal probabilities that an element is equal to 1.\nFor the L-field bound, at t = 0, we have ∂tdAL-field(f − t) = σ(s∗d), where s∗ is the minimizer of ∑D\nd=1 log(1 + e −sd), thus recovering the interpretation of [6] from another point of view.\nFor the logistic bound, this is the inference mechanism from [9], with ∂tdAlogistic(f − t) = Ezy ∗(z), where y∗(z) is the maximizer of maxy∈{0,1}D z ⊤y − f(y).

These models provide probabilistic interpretations of common combinatorial optimization tasks such as image segmentation. In this paper, we focus primarily on parameter estimation in the models from known upper-bounds on the intractable log-partition function. We show that the bound based on separable optimization on the base polytope of the submodular function is always inferior to a bound based on “perturb-and-MAP” ideas. Then, to learn parameters, given that our approximation of the log-partition function is an expectation (over our own randomization), we use a stochastic subgradient technique to maximize a lower-bound on the log-likelihood. This can also be extended to conditional maximum likelihood. We illustrate our new results in a set of experiments in binary image denoising, where we highlight the flexibility of a probabilistic model to learn with missing data.",
