      "text" : "Past several years have observed a significant progress in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom 2013; Cho et al. 2014; Sutskever et al. 2014; Bahdanau et al. 2015). Particularly, NMT has significantly enhanced the performance of translation between a language pair involving rich morphology prediction and/or significant word reordering (Luong and Manning 2015; Bentivogli et al. 2016). Long Short-Term Memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) enables NMT to conduct longdistance reordering, which is a significant challenge for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) (Brown et al. 1993; Koehn et al. 2003).\nUnlike SMT which employs a number of components, NMT adopts an end-to-end encoder-decoder framework to model the entire translation process. The role of encoder is to summarize the source sentence into a sequence of latent vectors, and the decoder acts as a language model to generate a target sentence word by word by selectively leveraging the information from the latent vectors at each step. In learning, NMT essentially estimates the likelihood of a target sentence given a source sentence.\nHowever, conventional NMT faces two main problems: 1 Translations generated by NMT systems often lack of ad-\nequacy. When generating target words, the decoder often\nCopyright © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nrepeatedly selects some parts of the source sentence while ignoring other parts, which leads to over-translation and under-translation (Tu et al. 2016b). This is mainly due to that NMT does not have a mechanism to ensure that the information in the source side is completely transformed to the target side.\n2 Likelihood objective is suboptimal in decoding. NMT utilizes a beam search to find a translation that maximizes the likelihood. However, we observe that likelihood favors short translations, and thus fails to distinguish good translation candidates from bad ones in a large decoding space (e.g., beam size = 100). The main reason is that likelihood only captures unidirectional dependency from source to target, which does not correlate well with translation adequacy (Li and Jurafsky 2016; Shen et al. 2016).\nWhile previous work partially solves the above problems, in this work we propose a novel encoder-decoderreconstructor model for NMT, aiming at alleviating these problems in a unified framework. As shown in Figure 1, given a Chinese sentence “duoge jichang beipo guanbi .”, the standard encoder-decoder translates it into an English sentence and assigns a likelihood score. Then, the newly added reconstructor reconstructs the translation back to the source\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n01 87\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 7\nN ov\n2 01\n6\nsentence and calculates the corresponding reconstruction score. Linear interpolation of the two scores produces an overall score of the translation.\nAs seen, the added reconstructor imposes a constraint that an NMT model should be able to reconstruct the input source sentence from the target-side hidden layers, which encourages decoder to embed complete information of the source side. The reconstruction score serves as an auxiliary objective to measure the adequacy of translation. The combined objective consisting of likelihood and reconstruction, which measures both fluency and adequacy of translations, is used in both training and testing.\nExperimental results show that the proposed approach consistently improves the translation performance when increasing the decoding space. Our model achieves a significant improvement of 2.3 BLEU points over a strong attention-based NMT system, and of 4.5 BLEU points over a state-of-the-art SMT system, trained on the same data."

      "text" : "Given a source sentence x = x1, . . . xj , . . . xJ and a target sentence y = y1, . . . yi, . . . yI , end-to-end NMT directly models the translation probability word by word:\nP (y|x) = I∏ i=1 P (yi|y<i,x; θ) (1)\nwhere θ is the model parameters and y<i = y1, . . . , yi−1 is partial translation. Prediction of the i-th target word is generally made in an encoder-decoder framework:\nP (yi|y<i,x; θ) ∝ exp { f(yi−1, si, ci; θ) } (2)\nwhere si is the i-th hidden target state computed by the decoder Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), ci is the i-th source representation for generating the i-th target word, and f(·) is an activation function in the decoder. Current NMT models differ in their ways of calculating ci from the hidden states from the encoder. Please refer to (Sutskever et al. 2014; Bahdanau et al. 2015) for more details. The parameters of NMT model are trained to maximize the likelihood of a set of training examples {[xn,yn]}Nn=1:\nL(θ) = argmax θ N∑ n=1 logP (yn|xn; θ) (3)\nWhen generating each target word, the decoder adaptively selects partial information (i.e., ci) from the encoder. This actually adopts a greedy way to select the most useful information for each generated word. There is, however, no mechanism to guarantee that the decoder conveys complete information from the source sentence to the target sentence.\nIn addition, we find that the performance of NMT decreases as the decoding space increases, as shown in Table 1. This is because likelihood favors short but inadequate translation candidates, which are newly added together with good candidates in larger decoding spaces. Normalizing likelihood by translation length faces the same problem."

      "text" : "Reconstruction is a standard concept in auto-encoder, which is usually realized by a feed forward network (Bourlard and Kamp 1988; Vincent et al. 2010; Socher et al. 2011). The model consists of an encoding function to compute a representation from an input, and a decoding function to reconstruct the input from the representation. The parameters involved in the two functions are trained to maximize the reconstruction score, which measures the similarity between the original input and reconstructed input.\nReconstruction examines whether the reconstructed input is faithful to the original input, which is essentially similar to the consideration of adequacy in translation. It is natural to integrate reconstruction into NMT to enhance adequacy of translation. The basic idea of our approach is to reconstruct the source sentence from the latent representations of decoder, and use the reconstruction score as the adequacy measure. Analogous to auto-encoder, our approach also learns a latent representation of source sentence on the target side. Our approach can be viewed as a supervised auto-encoder in the sense that the latent representation is not only used to reconstruct the source sentence, but also used to generate the target sentence."

More specifically, we base our approach on top of attention-based NMT (Bahdanau et al. 2015; Luong et al. 2015), which will be used as baseline in the experiments later. We note that the proposed approach is generally applicable to any other type of NMT architectures, such as the sequence-to-sequence model (Sutskever et al. 2014). The model architecture, shown in Figure 2, consists of two components: • Standard encoder-decoder reads the input sentence and\noutputs its translation along with the likelihood score, as shown in the background section.\n• Added reconstructor reads the hidden state sequence from the decoder and outputs a score of exactly reconstructing the input sentence, which we will describe below.\nReconstructor As shown in Figure 2, the reconstructor reconstructs the input. Here we use the hidden layer at the target side as the representation of the translation, since it plays a key role in generation of the translation. We aim at encouraging it to embed complete source information, and in the meantime to reduce the complexity of model and make the training easy.\nSpecifically, the reconstructor reconstructs the source sentence word by word, which is conditioned on the inverse context vector ĉj for each input word xj . The inverse context vector ĉj is computed as a weighted sum of hidden layers s at the target-side:\nĉj = I∑ i=1 α̂j,i · si (4)\nThe weight α̂j,i of each hidden layer sj is computed by an added inverse attention model, which has its own parameters independent from the original attention model. The reconstruction probability is calculated by\nR(x|s) = J∏ j=1 R(xj |x<j , s)\n= J∏ j=1 gr(xj−1, ĥj , ĉj) (5)\nwhere ĥj is the hidden state in the reconstructor, and computed by\nĥj = fr(xj−1, ĥj−1, ĉj) (6)\nHere gr(·) and fr(·) are softmax function and activation function for the reconstructor, respectively. The source words x share the same word embeddings with the encoder."

We choose the NIST 2002 (MT02) dataset as validation set, and the NIST 2005 (MT05), 2006 (MT06) and 2008 (MT08) datasets as test sets. We use the case-insensitive 4-gram NIST BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002) as evaluation metric, and signtest (Collins et al. 2005) for statistical significance test.\nWe compare our method with state-of-the-art SMT and NMT models: • MOSES (Koehn et al. 2007): an open source phrase-\nbased translation system with default configuration and a 4-gram language model trained on the target portion of training data.\n• RNNSEARCH: our re-implemented attention-based NMT system, which incorporates dropout (Hinton et al. 2012) on the output layer and improves the attention model by feeding the lastly generated word. For training RNNSEARCH, we limit the source and target vocabularies to the most frequent 30K words in Chinese and English. We train each model with the sentences of length up to 80 words in the training data. We shuffle mini-batches as we proceed and the mini-batch size is 80. The word embedding dimension is 620 and the hidden layer dimension is 1000. We train for 15 epochs using Adadelta (Zeiler 2012).\nFor our model, we set the hyper-parameter λ = 1.

For reconstruction, we use the reconstructor to stochastically generate a source sentence for each translation,2 and calculate the BLEU score of the reconstructed input under the reference of the original input. Generally, as shown in Figure 4, the BLEU score of translation goes up with the improvement of reconstruction over time. The translation performance reaches a peak at iteration 110K, when the model achieves a balance between likelihood and reconstruction score. Therefore, we use the trained model at iteration 110K in the following experiments."

To answer this question, we investigate the effect of reconstruction on different beam sizes k, as shown in Table 3. Our approach can indeed solve the problem: increasing the size of decoding space generally leads to improving the BLEU score. We attribute this to the ability of the combined objective to measure both fluency and adequacy of translation candidates. There is a significant gap between k = 10 and k = 100. However, keeping increasing k does not result in significant improvements of translation accuracy but greatly decreases decoding efficiency. Therefore, in the following experiments we set the max value of k to 100, and use normalized likelihood for k = 100 if we don’t use reconstruction in testing."

RNNSEARCH significantly outperforms Moses by 2.2 BLEU points on average, indicating that it is a strong baseline NMT system. This is mainly due to the introduction of two advanced techniques. Increasing beam size leads to decreasing translation performances on test sets, which is consistent with the result on the validation set. We compare our methods with “RNNSEARCH (Beam=10)” in the following analysis, since it yields the best performance in the baseline systems.\nFirst, the introduction of reconstruction significantly improves the performance over baseline by 1.1 BLEU points with beam size k = 10. Most importantly, we obtain a further improvement of 1.2 BLEU points when expanding the decoding space. Second, our approach also consistently improves the quality (in terms of Oracle score, see the last column) of k-best translation candidates over the baseline system on various beam sizes. This confirms our claim that the combined objective contributes to parameter training for generating better translation candidates."

Table 5 lists\nthe improvements from the two contribution sources. When applied only in training, reconstruction improves translation performance by generating fluent and adequate translation candidates. On top of that, reconstruction-based reranking further improves the performance. The improvements are more significant when decoding spaces increase."

      "text" : "Problem Analysis We then conduct a subjective evaluation to investigate the benefit of incorporating reconstruction on the randomly selected 200 sentences. Table 6 shows the results of subjective evaluation on translation. RNNSEARCH suffers from serious under-translation and over-translation problems, which is consistent with the finding in other work (Tu et al. 2016b). Incorporating reconstruction significantly alleviates these problems, and reduces 11.0% and 38.5% of under-translation and over-translation errors respectively. The main reason is that both undertranslation and over-translation lead to lower reconstruction scores, and thus are penalized by the reconstruction objective. As a result, the corresponding candidate is less likely to be selected as the final translation.\nLength Analysis Following Bahdanau et al. (2015), we group sentences of similar lengths together and compute the BLEU score for each group, as shown in Figure 5. Clearly the proposed approach outperforms all the other systems in all length segments. Specifically, RNNSEARCH outperforms Moses on all sentence segments, while its performance degrades faster than its competitors, which is consistent with the finding in (Bentivogli et al. 2016). This is\nmainly due to that RNNSEARCH seriously suffers from inadequate translations on long sentences (Tu et al. 2016b). Our model explicitly encourages the decoder to incorporate source information as much as possible, and thus the improvements are more significant on long sentences."

For the context gates (Tu et al. 2016a), we apply them on both source and target sides. Table 7 lists the comparison results. Coverage mechanism and context gates significantly improve translation performance individually, and combining them achieves a further improvement. This is consistent with the results in (Tu et al. 2016b; 2016a). Our model consistently improves the translation performance when further combined with the models."

      "heading" : "Related Work",
      "text" : "Our work is inspired by research on improving NMT by:\nEnhancing Translation Adequacy Recently, several work shows that NMT favors fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; 2016a). While all the work is towards enhancing adequacy of NMT, our approach is complimentary: the above work is still under the standard encoderdecoder framework, while we propose a novel encoderdecoder-reconstructor framework. Experiments show that combining those models together can further improve the translation performance.\nImproving Beam Search Standard NMT models exploit a simple beam search algorithm to generate the translation word by word. Several researchers rescore word candidates with additional features, such as language model probability (Gulcehre et al. 2015) and SMT features (He et al. 2016; Stahlberg et al. 2016). In contrast, Li and Jurafsky (2016) rescore translation candidates on sentence-level with the mutual information between source and target sides. In the above work, NMT is treated as a black-box and its weighted outputs are combined with other features only in testing. In this work, we move forward further by incorporating reconstruction score into the objective of training, which leads to creation of better translation candidates.\nCapturing Bidirectional Dependency Standard NMT models only capture the unidirectional dependency from source to target with the likelihood objective. It has been shown that combination of two directional models outperforms each model alone (Liang et al. 2006; Cheng et al. 2016a; Cheng et al. 2016b). Among them, Cheng et al. (2016b) reconstruct the monolingual corpora with two separate source-to-target and target-to-source NMT models. Closely related to Cheng et al. (2016b), our approach aims at enhancing adequacy of unidirectional (i.e., source-to-target) NMT via an auxiliary target-to-source objective on parallel corpora, while theirs focuses on learning bidirectional NMT models via auto-encoders on monolingual corpora."

      "heading" : "Conclusion",

The advantage of the proposed approach is of two-fold. First, it improves parameter training for producing better translation candidates. Second, it consistently improves translation performance when the decoding space increases, while conventional NMT fails to do so. Experimental results show that the two advantages can indeed help our approach to consistently improve translation performance.\nThere is still a significant gap between de facto translation and oracle of k-best translation candidates, especially when the decoding space increases. We plan to narrow the gap with rich features, which can better measure the quality of translation candidates. It is also necessary to validate the effectiveness of our approach on more language pairs and other NMT architectures."

It has been widely observed that NMT tends to repeatedly translate some source words while mistakenly ignoring other words. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel encoder-decoder-reconstructor framework for NMT. The reconstructor, incorporated into the NMT model, manages to reconstruct the input source sentence from the hidden layer of the output target sentence, to ensure that the information in the source side is transformed to the target side as much as possible. Experiments show that the proposed framework significantly improves the adequacy of NMT output and achieves superior translation result over state-of-theart NMT and statistical MT systems.",
