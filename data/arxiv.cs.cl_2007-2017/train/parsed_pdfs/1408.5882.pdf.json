      "text" : "Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Graves et al., 2013) in recent years. Within natural language processing, much of the work with deep learning methods has involved learning word vector representations through neural language models (Bengio et al., 2003; Yih et al., 2011; Mikolov et al., 2013) and performing composition over the learned word vectors for classification (Collobert et al., 2011). Word vectors, wherein words are projected from a sparse, 1-of-V encoding (here V is the vocabulary size) onto a lower dimensional vector space via a hidden layer, are essentially feature extractors that encode semantic features of words in their dimensions. In such dense representations, semantically close words are likewise close—in euclidean or cosine distance—in the lower dimensional vector space.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) utilize layers with convolving filters that are applied to\nlocal features (LeCun et al., 1998). Originally invented for computer vision, CNN models have subsequently been shown to be effective for NLP and have achieved good results in semantic parsing (Yih et al., 2014), search query retrieval (Shen et al., 2014), sentence modeling (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), and other traditional NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011).\nIn the present work, we train a simple CNN with one layer of convolution on top of word vectors obtained from an unsupervised neural language model. These vectors were trained by Mikolov et al. (2013) on 100 billion words of Google News, and are publicly available.1 We initially keep the word vectors static and learn only the other parameters of the model. Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are ‘universal’ feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements. We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.\nOur work is philosophically similar to Razavian et al. (2014) which showed that for image classification, feature extractors obtained from a pretrained deep learning model perform well on a variety of tasks—including tasks that are very different from the original task for which the feature extractors were trained."

      "heading" : "2 Model",
      "text" : "The model architecture, shown in figure 1, is a slight variant of the CNN architecture of Collobert et al. (2011). Let xi ∈ Rk be the k-dimensional word vector corresponding to the i-th word in the sentence. A sentence of length n (zero-padded\n1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/\nar X\niv :1\n40 8.\n58 82\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n2 5\nA ug\n2 01\n4\nwhere necessary) is represented as\nx1:n = x1 ⊕ x2 ⊕ . . .⊕ xn, (1)\nwhere ⊕ is the concatenation operator. In general, let xi:i+j refer to the concatenation of words xi,xi+1, . . . ,xi+j . A convolution operation involves a filter w ∈ Rh×k, which is applied to a window of h words to produce a new feature. For example, a feature ci is generated from a window of words xi:i+h−1 by\nci = f(w · xi:i+h−1 + b). (2)\nHere b ∈ R is a bias term and f is a non-linear function such as the hyperbolic tangent. This filter is applied to each possible window of words in the sentence {x1:h,x2:h+1, . . . ,xn−h+1:n} to produce a feature map\nc = [c1, c2, . . . , cn−h+1], (3)\nwith c ∈ Rn−h+1. We then apply a max-overtime pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) over the feature map and take the maximum value ĉ = max{c} as the feature corresponding to this particular filter. The idea is to capture the most important feature—one with the highest value—for each feature map. This pooling scheme naturally deals with variable sentence lengths.\nWe have described the process by which one feature is extracted from one filter. The model uses multiple filters (with varying window sizes) to obtain multiple features. These features form the penultimate layer and are passed to a fully connected softmax layer whose output is the probability distribution over labels.\nIn one of the model variants, we experiment with having two ‘channels’ of word vectors—one\nthat is kept static throughout training and one that is fine-tuned via backpropagation (section 3.2).2 In the multichannel architecture, illustrated in figure 1, each filter is applied to both channels and the results are added to calculate ci in equation (2). The model is otherwise equivalent to the single channel architecture."

      "heading" : "2.1 Regularization",
      "text" : "For regularization we employ dropout on the penultimate layer with a constraint on l2-norms of the weight vectors (Hinton et al., 2012). Dropout prevents co-adaptation of hidden units by randomly dropping out—i.e., setting to zero—a proportion p of the hidden units during fowardbackpropagation. That is, given the penultimate layer z = [ĉ1, . . . , ĉm] (note that here we have m filters), instead of using\ny = w · z+ b (4)\nfor output unit y in forward propagation, dropout uses\ny = w · (z ◦ r) + b, (5)\nwhere ◦ is the element-wise multiplication operator and r ∈ Rm is a ‘masking’ vector of Bernoulli random variables with probability p of being 1. Gradients are backpropagated only through the unmasked units. At test time, the learned weight vectors are scaled by p such that ŵ = pw, and ŵ is used (without dropout) to score unseen sentences. We additionally constrain l2-norms of the weight vectors by rescaling w to have ||w||2 = s whenever ||w||2 > s after a gradient descent step.\n2We employ language from computer vision where a color image has red, green, and blue channels."

Classification involves detecting positive/negative reviews (Pang and Lee, 2005).3\n• MR-b: Extension of MR-a but with train /dev/test splits provided, and fine-grained labels (very positive, positive, neutral, negative, very negative). The reviews were relabeled by Socher et al. (2013).4\n• MR-c: Same as MR-b but with neutral reviews removed and binary labels.\n• Subj: Subjectivity dataset where the task is to classify a sentence as being subjective or objective (Pang and Lee, 2004).\n• TREC: TREC question dataset—task involves classifying a question into 6 question types (whether the question is about person, location, numeric information, etc.) (Li and Roth, 2002).5\n• CR: Customer reviews of various products (cameras, MP3s etc.). Task is to predict positive/negative reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).6\n3https://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ 4http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/. Data is actually provided at the phrase-level and hence we train the model on both phrases and sentences but only score on sentences at test time, as in Socher et al. (2013), Kalchbrenner et al. (2014), and Le and Mikolov (2014). Thus the training set is an order of magnitude larger than listed in table 1 (138K for MR-b and 65K for MR-c). 5http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/QA/QC/ 6http://www.cs.uic.edu/ liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html\n• MPQA: Opinion polarity detection subtask of the MPQA dataset (Wiebe et al., 2005).7"

These values were chosen via a grid search on the MR-c dev set.\nWe do not otherwise perform any datasetspecific tuning other than early stopping on dev sets.

We use the publicly available word2vec vectors that were trained on 100 billion words from Google News. The vectors have dimensionality of 300 and were trained using the continuous bag-of-words architecture (Mikolov et al., 2013). Words not present in the set of pre-trained words are initialized randomly."

All words— including the unknown ones that are randomly initialized—are kept static and only the other parameters of the model are learned.\n• CNN-non-static: Same as above but the pretrained vectors are fine-tuned for each task.\n• CNN-multichannel: A model with two sets of word vectors. Each set of vectors is treated as a ‘channel’ and each filter is applied\n7http://www.cs.pitt.edu/mpqa/\nto both channels, but gradients are backpropagated only through one of the channels. Hence the model is able to fine-tune one set of vectors while keeping the other static. Both channels are initialized with word2vec.\nIn order to disentangle the effect of the above variations versus other random factors, we eliminate other sources of randomness—CV-fold assignment, initialization of unknown word vectors, initialization of CNN parameters—by keeping them uniform within each dataset."

      "heading" : "4 Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "Results of our models against other methods are listed in table 2. Our baseline model with all randomly initialized words (CNN-rand) does not perform well. While we had expected performance gains through the use of pre-trained vectors, we were surprised at the magnitude of the gains. Even a simple model with static vectors (CNN-static) performs remarkably well, giving competitive re-\nsults against the more sophisticated deep learning models that utilize complex pooling schemes (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) or require parse trees to be computed beforehand (Socher et al., 2013). These results suggest that the pre-trained vectors are good, ‘universal’ feature extractors and can be utilized across datasets. Fine-tuning the pretrained vectors for each task gives still further improvements (CNN-non-static)."

      "text" : "We had initially hoped that the multichannel model would offer a compromise between static and non-static vectors and thus work better than the single channel model, especially on smaller datasets. However, the results are inconclusive. Further experiments on combining static and nonstatic vectors may be warranted. For instance, instead of using an additional channel for the nonstatic portion, one could maintain a single channel but have some dimensions that are kept static and some dimensions that are allowed to be fine-tuned during training."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.2 Static vs. Non-static Representations",
      "text" : "The multichannel model is able to fine-tune the non-static channel to make it more specific to the task-at-hand (as is the case with the single channel non-static model). For example, good is most similar to bad in word2vec, presumably because they are (almost) syntactically equivalent. But for vectors in the non-static channel that were finetuned on the MR-c dataset, this is no longer the case (table 3). Similarly, good is arguably closer to nice than it is to great for expressing sentiment, and this is indeed reflected in the learned vectors.\nFor (randomly initialized) tokens not in the set of pre-trained vectors, fine-tuning allows them to learn more meaningful representations: the network learns that exclamation marks are associated with effusive expressions and that commas are conjunctive (table 3)."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.3 Further Observations",
      "text" : "We report on some further experiments and observations:\n• Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) report much worse results with a CNN that has essentially\nthe same architecture as our single channel model. For example, their Max-TDNN (Time Delay Neural Network) with randomly initialized words obtains 37.4% on the MR-b dataset, compared to 45.0% for our model. We attribute such discrepancy to our CNN having much more capacity (multiple filter widths and feature maps).\n• Dropout proved to be such a good regularizer that it was fine to use a larger than necessary network and simply let dropout regularize it. Dropout consistently added 2%–4% relative performance.\n• When randomly initializing words not in word2vec, we obtained slight improvements by sampling each dimension from U [−a, a] where a was chosen such that the randomly initialized vectors have the same variance as the pre-trained ones. It would be interesting to see if employing more sophisticated methods to mirror the distribution of pre-trained vectors in the initialization process gives further improvements.\n• We briefly experimented with another set of publicly available word vectors trained by Collobert et al. (2011) on Wikipedia,8 and found that word2vec gave far superior performance. It is not clear whether this is due to Mikolov et al. (2013)’s architecture or the 100 billion word Google News dataset.\n• Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012) gave similar results to Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) but required fewer epochs."

Despite little tuning of hyperparameters, this simple model achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks, suggesting that the pre-trained vectors are ‘universal’ feature extractors that can be utilized for various classification tasks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning results in further improvements. We finally describe a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both pre-trained and task-specific vectors by having multiple channels.
