      "text" : "In recent years, deep neural networks have redefined state-of-the-art in many application domains, notably in computer vision [11] and speech processing [14]. In order to scale to more challenging problems, however, neural networks must become larger, which implies an increase in computational resources. Shifting computation to highly parallel platforms such as GPUs has enabled the training of massive neural networks that would otherwise train too slowly on conventional CPUs. While the extremely high computational power used for the experiment performed in [12] (16,000 cores training for many days) was greatly reduced in [4] (3 servers training for many days), specialized high-performance platforms still require several machines and several days of processing time. However, there may exist more fundamental changes to the algorithms involved which can greatly assist in scaling neural networks.\nMany of these state-of-the-art networks have several common properties: the use of rectified-linear activation functions in the hidden neurons, and a high level of sparsity induced by dropout regularization or a sparsity-inducing penalty term on the loss function. Given that many of the activations are effectively zero, due to the combination of sparsity and the hard thresholding of rectified linear units, a large amount of computation is wasted on calculating values that are eventually truncated to zero and provide no contribution to the network outputs or error components. Here we focus on this\nkey observation in devising a scheme that can predict the zero-valued activations in a computationally cost-efficient manner."

      "heading" : "2.1 Exploiting Redundancy in Deep Architectures",
      "text" : "In [5], the authors made the observation that deep models tend to have a high degree of redundancy in their weight parameterization. The authors exploit this redundancy in order to train as few as 5% of the weights in a neural network while estimating the other 95% with the use of carefully constructed low-rank decompositions of the weight matrices. Such a reduction in the number of active training parameters can render optimization easier by reducing the number of variables to optimize over. Moreover, it can help address the problem of scalability by greatly reducing the communication overhead in a distributed system.\nAssuming there is a considerable amount of redundancy in the weight parameterization, a similar level of redundancy is likely found in the activation patterns of individual neurons. Therefore, given an input sample, the set of redundant activations in the network may be approximated. If a sufficiently accurate approximation can be obtained using low computational resources, activations for a subset of neurons in the network’s hidden layers need not be calculated.\nIn [2] and [3], the authors propose the idea of conditional computation in neural networks, where the network is augmented by a gating model that turns activations on or off depending on the state of the network. If this gating model is able to reliably estimate which neurons need to be calculated for a particular input, great improvements in computational efficiency may be obtainable if the network is sufficiently sparse. Figure 2.1 illustrates a conditional computation unit augmenting a layer of a neural net by using some function f (U, V, al) to determine which hidden unit activations, a (i) l+1, in layer l + 1 should be computed given the activations al of layer l."

      "text" : "For many datasets considered in the literature, sparse representations have been shown to be superior to dense representations, particularly in the context of deep architectures [7]. However, sparse representations learned by neural networks with sigmoidal activations are not truly “sparse”, as activations only approach zero in the limit towards negative infinity. A conditional computation model estimating the sparsity of a sigmoidal network would thus have to impose some threshold, beyond which the neuron is considered inactive. So-called “hard-threshold” activation functions such as rectified-linear units, on the other hand, produce true zeros which can be used by conditional computation models without imposing additional hyperparameters."

      "text" : "Given the activation al of layer l of a neural network, the activation al+1 of layer l + 1 is given by:\nal+1 = σ(alWl) (1)\nwhere σ(·) denotes the function defining the neuron’s non-linearity, al ∈ Rn×h1 , al+1 ∈ Rn×h2 , Wl ∈ Rh1×h2 . If the weight matrix is highly redundant, as in [5], it can be well-approximated using a low-rank representation and we may rewrite (1) as\nal+1 = σ(alUlVl) (2)\nwhere UlVl is the low-rank approximation of Wl, Ul ∈ Rh1×k, Vl ∈ Rk×h2 , k ≪ min(h1, h2). So long as k < h1h2\nh1+h2 , the low-rank multiplication alUlVl requires fewer arithmetic operations than\nthe full-rank multiplication alWl, assuming the multiplication alUl occurs first. When σ(·) is the rectified-linear function,\nσ(x) = max(0, x) (3)\nsuch that all negative elements of the linear transform alWl become zero, one only needs to estimate the sign of the elements of the linear transform in order to predict the zero-valued elements. Because the weights in a deep neural network can be well-approximated using a low-rank estimation, the small error in the low-rank estimation is of marginal relevance in the context of in recovering the sign of the operation. Figure 3.1 illustrates the error profile of a low-rank estimation compared with that of the activation sign estimator as a function of the rank (varied from one to full-rank). One can see that the error of the activation sign estimator diminishes far more quickly than the error of the low-rank activation.\nGiven a low-rank approximation Wl ≈ Ŵl, the estimated sign of al+1 is given by sgn(al+1) ≈ sgn(alŴl) = Sl (4)\nEach entry a(i) l+1 is given by a dot product between the row vector al and the column vector W (i) l . If sgn(alŴ (i) l ) = −1, then the true activation a(i) l+1 is likely negative, and will likely become zero after the rectified-linear function is applied. Considerable speed gains are possible if we skip those dot products based on the prediction; such gains are especially substantial when the network is very sparse. The overall activations for a hidden layer l augmented by the activation estimator is given by σ (a (W · S)), where · denotes the element-wise product."

      "text" : "The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a common matrix decomposition technique that factorizes a matrix A ∈ Rm×n into A = UΣV T , U ∈ Rm×m,Σ ∈ Rm×n, V ∈ Rn×n. By [6], the matrix A can be approximated using a low rank matrix Âr corresponding to the solution of the constrained optimization of\nmin Âr\n‖A− Âr‖F (5)\nwhere ‖ · ‖F is the Frobenius norm, and Âr is constrained to be of rank r < rank(A). The minimizer Âr is given by taking the first r columns of U , the first r diagonal entries of Σ, and the first r columns of V . The resulting matrices Ur, Σr, and Vr are multiplied, yielding Âr = UrΣrV Tr . The low-rank approximation Ŵ = UV is then defined such that Ŵ = Ur(ΣrV Tr ), where U = Ur and V = ΣrV Tr .\nUnfortunately, calculating the SVD is an expensive operation, on the order of O(mn2), so recalculating the SVD upon the completion of every minibatch adds significant overhead to the training procedure. Given that we are uniquely interested in estimating in the sign of al+1 = alWl, we can opt to calculate the SVD less frequently than once per minibatch, assuming that the weights Wl do not change significantly over the course of a single epoch so as to corrupt the sign estimation."

      "text" : "To overcome the additional overhead imposed by the conditional computation architecture, the neural network must have sparse activations. Without encouragement to settle on weights that result in sparse activations, such as penalties on the loss function, a neural network will not necessarily become sparse enough to be useful in the context of conditional computation. Therefore, an ℓ1 penalty for the activation vector of each layer is applied to the overall loss function, such that\nJ(W,λ) = L(W ) + λ\nL ∑\nl=1\n‖al‖1 (6)\nSuch a penalty is commonly used in sparse dictionary learning algorithms and tends to push elements of al towards zero [13].\nDropout regularization [9] is another technique known to sparsify the hidden activations in a neural network. Dropout first sets the hidden activations al to zero with probability p. During training, the sparsity of the network is likely less than p for each minibatch. When the regularized network is running in the inference mode, dropout has been observed to have a sparsifying effect on the hidden activations [17]."

      "text" : "The neural network is built using Rasmus Berg Palm’s Deep Learning Toolbox [16]. All hidden units are rectified-linear, and the output units are softmax trained with a negative log-likelihood loss function. The weights, w, are initialized as w ∼ N ( 0, σ2 )\nand biases b are set to 1 in order to encourage the neurons to operate in their non-saturated region once training begins. In all experiments, the dropout probability p is fixed to 0.5.\nThe learning rate γ is scheduled such that γn = γ0λn where γn is the learning rate for the nth epoch, γ0 is the initial learning rate, and λ is a decay term slightly less than 1, eg., 0.995. The momentum term ν is scheduled such that νn = max (νmax, ν0βn) where νn is the momentum for the nth epoch, νmax is the maximum allowed momentum, ν0 is the initial momentum, and β is an incremental term slightly greater than 1, eg., 1.05.\nTo simplify prototyping, the feed-forward is calculated for a layer, and the activation estimator is immediately applied before the next layer activations are used. This is equivalent to bypassing the calculations for activations that are likely to produce zeros. In practice, re-calculating the SVD once per epoch for the activation estimator seems to be a decent tradeoff between activation estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, but this may not necessarily be true for other datasets."

Each example is an RGB 32 × 32 (3072-dimensional) image. To pre-process the dataset, each image is transformed into the YUV colorspace. Next, local contrast normalization [10] followed by a histogram equalization is applied to the Y channel. The U and V channels are discarded, resulting in a 1024-dimensional vector per example. The dataset is then normalized for the neural network by subtracting out the mean and dividing by the square root of the variance for each variable.\nTo evaluate the sensitivity of the activation estimator, several parameterizations for the activation estimator are evaluated. Each network is trained with the hyperparameters in Table 4.1, and the results of seven parameterizations are shown in Figure 4.1. Each parameterization is described by the rank of each approximation, eg., ‘75-50-40-30’ describes a network with an activation estimator using a 75-rank approximation for W1, a 50-rank approximation for W2, a 40-rank approximation for W3, and a 30-rank approximation for W4. Note that a low-rank approximation is not necessary for W5 (the weights connecting the last hidden layer to the output layer), as we do not want to approximate the activations for the output layer.\nSome runs, specifically 25-25-25-25 and 50-35-25-25 in Figure 4.1 exhibit an initial decrease in classification error, followed by a gradual increase in classification error as training progresses. In the initial epochs, the hidden layer activations are mostly positive because the weights are relatively small and the biases are very large. As a consequence, the activation estimation is a much simpler task for the initial epochs. However, as the pattern of the activation signs diversifies as the network continues to train, the lower-rank approximations begin to fail."

Very little pre-processing is required to achieve good results - each feature is transformed by xt = x√\nσ2 max − 0.5, where x is the input feature, σ2max is the maximum variance of all features, and 0.5 is a constant term to roughly center each feature. Several parameterizations for the activation estimator are evaluated for a neural network trained with the hyperparameters listed in Table 4.1 using the same approach as the SVHN experiment above. The results for the validation set plotted against the epoch number are shown in Figure 4.3, and the final test set accuracy is reported in Table 4.3.\nA neural network with a very low-rank weight matrix in the activation estimation can train surprisingly well on MNIST. Lowering the rank from 784-600-400 to 50-35-25 impacts performance negligibly.

      "text" : "Low-rank estimations of weight matrices of a neural network obtained via once-per-epoch SVD work very well as efficient estimators of the sign of the activation for the next hidden layer. In the context of rectified-linear hidden units, computation time can be reduced greatly if this estimation is reliable and the hidden activations are sufficiently sparse. This approach is applicable to any hardthresholding activation function, such as the functions investigated in [8], and can be easily extended to be used with convolutional neural networks.\nWhile the activation estimation error does not tend to deviate too greatly inbetween minibatches over an epoch, as illustrated in Figure 5.1, this is not guaranteed. An online approach to the lowrank approximation would therefore be preferable to a once-per-epoch calculation. In addition, while the low-rank approximation given by SVD minimizes the objective function ‖A − Âr‖F , this is not necessarily the best objective function for an activation estimator, where we seek to minimize ‖σ (aW )− σ (a (W · S))‖, which is a much more difficult and non-convex objective function. Also, setting the hyperparameters for the activation estimator can be a tedious process involving expensive cross-validation when an adaptive algorithm could instead choose the rank based on the spectrum of the singular values. Therefore, developing a more suitable low-rank approximation algorithm could provide a promising future direction of research.\nIn [1], the authors propose a method called “adaptive dropout” by which the dropout probabilities are chosen by a function optimized by gradient descent instead of fixed to some value. This approach bears some resemblance to this paper, but with the key difference that the approach in [1] is motivated by improved regularization and this paper’s method is motivated by computational efficiency. However, the authors introduce a biasing term that allows for greater sparsity that could be intro-\nduced into this paper’s methodology. By modifying the conditional computation unit to compute sgn (aUV − b), where b is some bias, we can introduce a parameter that can tune the sparsity of the network, allowing for a more powerful trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency."

This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced in [2], where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.",
