      "text" : "Entity type classification is the task for assigning types or labels such as organization, location to entity mentions in a document. This classification is useful for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as relation extraction (Mintz et al., 2009), machine translation (Koehn et al.,\n2007), question answering (Lin et al., 2012) and knowledge base construction (Dong et al., 2014).\nThere has been considerable amount of work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) (Collins and Singer, 1999; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Ratinov and Roth, 2009; Manning et al., 2014), which classifies entity mentions into a small set of mutually exclusive types, such as Person, Location, Organization and Misc. However, these types are not enough for some NLP applications such as relation extraction, knowledge base construction (KBC) and question answering. In relation extraction and KBC, knowing fine-grained types for entities can significantly increase the performance of the relation extractor (Ling and Weld, 2012; Koch et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2015) since this helps in filtering out candidate relation types that do not follow the type constrain. Fine-grained entity types provide additional information while matching questions to its potential answers and significantly improves performance (Dong et al., 2015). For example, Li and Roth (2002) rank questions based on their expected answer types (will the answer be food, vehicle or disease).\nTypically, FETC systems use over hundred labels, arranged in a hierarchical structure. An important aspect of FETC is that based on local context, two different mentions of same entity can have different labels. We illustrate this through an example in Figure 1. All three sentences S1, S2, and S3 mention same entity Barack Obama. However, looking at the context, we can infer that S1 mentions Obama as a person/author, S2 mentions Obama only as a person, and S3 mentions Obama as a person/politician.\nAvailable training data for FETC has noisy labels. Creating manually annotated training data for FETC is time consuming, expensive, and error prone. Note that, a human annotator will\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 70\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 Fe\nb 20\n17\nhave to assign a subset of correct labels from a set of around hundred labels for each entity mention in the corpus. Existing FETC systems use distant supervision paradigm (Craven and Kumlien, 1999) to automatically generate training data. Distant supervision maps each entity in the corpus to knowledge bases such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007). This method assigns same set of labels to all mentions of an entity across the corpus. For example, Barack Obama is a person, politician, lawyer, and author. If a knowledge base has these four matching labels for Barack Obama, then distant supervision assigns all of them to every mention of Barack Obama. Training data generated with distant supervision will fail to distinguish between mentions of Barack Obama in sentences S1, S2, and S3.\nExisting FETC systems have one or both of following drawbacks:\n1. Assuming training data to be noise free (Ling and Weld, 2012; Yosef et al., 2012; Yogatama et al., 2015; Shimaoka et al., 2016)\n2. Use of hand crafted features (Ling and Weld, 2012; Yosef et al., 2012; Yogatama et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2016)\nWe have observed that for real world datasets, more than twenty five percent of training data has noisy labels. First drawback propagates this noise in training data to the FETC model. To extract hand crafted features various NLP tools are used. Since errors inevitably exist in such tools, the second drawback propagates errors of these tools to FETC model.\nWe propose a neural network based model to overcome the two drawbacks of existing FETC systems. First, we separate training data into clean and noisy partitions using the same method as in AFET system (Ren et al., 2016). For these parti-\ntions, we use simple yet effective non-parametric variant of hinge loss function while training. To avoid use of hand crafted features, we learn representations for given entity mention and its context.\nAdditionally, we investigate effectiveness of using transfer learning (Pratt, 1993) for FETC task both at feature and model level. We show that feature level transfer learning can be used to improve performance of other FETC system such as AFET, by up to 4.5% in micro-F1 score. Similarly, model level transfer learning can be used to improve performance of the same model using different dataset by up to 3.8% in micro-F1 score.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1. We propose a simple neural network model that learns representations for entity mention and its context, and incorporate noisy label information using a variant of non-parametric hinge loss function. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed model, with an average relative improvement of 2.69% in micro-F1 score.\n2. We investigate the use of feature level and model level transfer-learning strategies in the domain of the FETC task. The proposed transfer learning strategies further improve the state-of-the-art on BBN dataset by 3.8% in micro-F1 score."

      "text" : "Ling et al. (2012) proposed the first system for FETC task, which used 112 overlapping labels. They used linear classifier perceptron for multilabel classification. Yosef et al. (2012) used multiple binary SVM classifiers in a hierarchy, to classify an entity mention to a set of 505 types. While the initial work assumed that all labels present in a training dataset for an entity mention are correct, Gillick et al. (2014) introduced context dependent FETC and proposed a set of heuristics for pruning labels that might not be relevant given the entity mention’s local context. Yogatama et al. (2015) proposed an embedding based model where userdefined features and labels were embedded into a low dimensional feature space to facilitate information sharing among labels.\nShimaoka et al. (2016) proposed an attentive neural network model that used LSTMs to encode entity mention’s context and used an atten-\n(a) α models label-label correlation.

However, the model assumed that all labels obtained via distant supervision are correct. In contrast, our model does not assume that all labels are correct. To learn entity representation, we propose a scheme which is simpler yet more effective.\nMost recently, Ren et al. (2016) have proposed AFET, an FETC system. AFET separates the loss function for clean and noisy entity mentions. AFET uses label-label correlation information obtained by given data in its parametric loss function (model parameter α). During inference, AFET uses a threshold to separate positive types from negative types (similarity threshold parameter d). However, AFET’s loss function is sensitive to change in parameters, which are data dependent. Figure 2 shows the effect of parameter α and d, on AFET performance evaluated on different datasets. In contrast, our model uses a simple yet effective variant of hinge loss function. This function does not need to tune the similarity threshold.\nTransfer learning is well applied to many NLP applications, such as cross-domain document classification (Shi et al., 2010), multi-lingual word clustering (Täckström et al., 2012) and sentiment classification (Mou et al., 2016). Initialization of word vectors with pre-trained word vectors in neural network models can be considered as one of the best example of transfer learning in NLP. Wang et al. (2015) provide a broad overview of transfer learning techniques used for language processing."

Input: The input to the model is a training and testing corpus consisting of a set of sentences on which entity mentions have been identified. In training corpus, every entity mention will have corresponding labels according to a given hierarchy. Formally, a training corpus Dtrain consists of a set of sentences, S = {si}Ni=1. Each sentence si will have one or more entity mentions denoted by mij,k, where j and k denotes indices of start and end tokens, respectively. SetM consists of all the entity mentions mij,k. For every entity mention mij,k, there will be a corresponding label vector lij,k ∈ {0, 1}K , which is a binary vector, where lij,kt = 1 if t\nth type is true otherwise it will be zero.

An entity mention mij,k is said to be clean if its labels lij,k belong to only a single path (not necessary to be leaf) in the hierarchy Ψ, that is its labels are not ambiguous; otherwise, it is noisy.

      "heading" : "3.3 Feature representations",
      "text" : "Mention representation: This representation captures information about entity mention’s morphology and orthography. We decompose an entity mention into character sequence, and use a vanilla LSTM encoder (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) to encode character sequences to a fixed dimensional vector. Formally, for entity mention mij,k, we decompose it into a sequence of character tokens cij,k1 , c i j,k2\n, . . . ,cij,k|mi j,k | , where |mij,k|\ndenotes the total number of characters present in the entity mention. For entity mention containing multiple tokens, we join these tokens with a space in between tokens. Every character will have corresponding vector representation in a lookup table for characters. The character sequence is then fed one by one to a LSTM encoder, and the final output is used as a feature representation for entity mention mij,k. We denote this process by a function Fm : M → RDm , where Dm is the number of dimensions for mention representation. The whole process is illustrated in figure 4 (Mention representation). Context representation: This representation captures information about the context surrounding the entity mention. Context representation is further divided into two parts, left and right context representation. The left context consists of a sequence of tokens within a sentence from the start of a sentence till the last token of entity mention. The right context consists of a sequence\nof tokens from the start of entity mention till the end of a sentence. We use bi-directional LSTM encoders (Graves et al., 2013) to encode token level sequences of both context to a fixed dimensional vector. Formally, for an entity mentionmij,k present in a sentence si, decompose si into a sequence of tokens si1, s i 2, . . . , s i k for the left context, and sij , s i j+1, . . . , s i |si| for the right context, where |si| denotes the number of tokens in the sentence. Every token will have a corresponding vector representation in a lookup tables for token. The token sequence is then fed one by one to a bi-directional LSTM encoder, and the final output will be used as feature representation. We denote this whole process by function Flc : (M,S) → RDlc for computing left context and Frc : (M,S) → RDrc for computing right context. Dlc andDrc are the number of dimensions for the left context and the right context representation, respectively. The whole process is illustrated in figure 4 (Left and right context representation).\nThe context representation described above is slightly different from what was proposed in (Shimaoka et al., 2016), here we include entity mention tokens within both left and right context, to explicitly encode context relative to an entity mention.\nIn the end, we concatenate entity mention and its context representation into a single Df dimensional vector, where Df = Dm + Dlc + Drc. This complete process is denoted by a function\nF : (M,S)→ RDf given by:\nF (mij,k, s i) = Fm(m i j,k)⊕ Flc(mij,k, si)⊕ Frc(mij,k, si) (1) where ⊕ denotes vector concatenation. For brevity, we will now omit the use of subscript j, k from mij,k and l i j,k, and will use f\ni to denote feature representation for entity mention and its context obtained via equation 1."

      "heading" : "3.5 Optimization",
      "text" : "We use two different loss functions to model clean and noisy entity mentions. For clean entity mentions, we use a hinge loss function. The intuition is simple: maintain a margin, centered at zero, between positive and negative type scores. The scores are computed by similarity between an entity mention and label types (eq. 3). Hinge loss function has two advantages. First, it intuitively seprates positive and negative labels during inference. Second, it is independent of data dependent parameter. Formally, for a given entity mention mi and its label li we compute the associated loss as given by:\nLc(m i, li) = ∑ t∈γ max(0, 1− s(mi, lit))\n+ ∑ t∈γ̄ max(0, 1 + s(mi, lit)) (4)\nwhere γ and γ̄ are set of indices that have positive and negative labels respectively.\nFor noisy entity mentions, we propose a variant of a hinge loss where, like Lc, score for all negative labels should go below −1. However, for positive labels, as we don’t know which labels are relevant to entity mention’s local context, we propose that the maximum score from the set of given positive labels should be greater than one. This maintains a margin between all negative types and the most relevant positive type. Formally, noisy label loss, Ln is defined as:\nLn(m i, li) = ∑ t∈γ̄ max(0, 1 + s(mi, lit))\n+ max(0, 1− s(mi, lit∗)); t∗ = arg max\nt∈γ s(mi, lit) (5)\nAgain, using this loss function makes it intuitive to set a threshold of zero during inference.\nThese loss functions are different from the loss functions used in (Yogatama et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2016) in a way that, we make strict absolute criteria to distinguish between positive and negative labels. Whereas in (Yogatama et al., 2015; Ren et al., 2016) positive labels should have a higher score than negative labels. As their scoring is relative, the final result varies on the threshold used to separate positive and negative labels.\nTo train the partitioned dataset together, we formulate the joint objective problem as:\nmin θ O = ∑ m∈Mc Lc(m, l) + ∑ m∈Mn Ln(m, l) (6)\nwhere θ is the collection of all model parameters that needs to be learned. To jointly optimize the objective O, we use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014), a stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithm."

Comparison with feature engineering methods: The proposed model performs better than the existing feature engineered methods (FIGER, HYENA, AFET-NoCo, AFET-CoH) consistently across all datasets on Micro-F1 and MacroF1 evaluation metrics. These methods do not model label-label correlation based on data. In comparison with AFET, the proposed model outperforms AFET on Wiki and BBN dataset in terms of Micro-F1 evaluation metric. This indicates benefits of feature learning as well as data driven label-label correlation. We do a type-wise perfor-\nmance comparison on OntoNotes dataset in subsection 4.5. Comparison with variants of our model: The proposed model performs better on all dataset as compared to our-AllC in terms of micro-F1 score. However, we find the performance difference on Wiki and OntoNotes dataset is not statistically significant. We investigated it further and found that across all three datasets, there exist only few entity types for which more than 85% of entity mentions are noisy. These types consist of approximately 3- 4% of test set, and our model fails on these types (zero micro-F1 score). However, our-AllC performs relatively well on these types. Examples of such types are: /building, /person/political figure, /GPE/STATE PROVINCE. This indicates two limitations of the proposed model. First, the separating of clean and noisy mentions based on the hierarchy has its own inherent limitation of assuming labels within a path are correct. Second, our model learns better if more clean examples are available at the cost of not learning very noisy types. We will try to address these limitations in our future work. Compared with our-NoM, the proposed model performs slightly better across all datasets in terms of micro-F1 score. Feature level transfer learning analysis: We observed 4.5% performance increase in microF1 score of AFET on BBN dataset, after replacing hand-crafted features with feature representations generated by the proposed model. This indicates usefulness of the learnt feature representations. However, if we repeat the same process with OntoNotes dataset, there is only a subtle change in performance. This is majorly because of the data distribution of OntoNotes dataset is different from\nthat of Wiki dataset. This issue is discussed in the next subsection.

Distant supervision paradigm is extensively used to generate training data for this task. However, generated training data assigns same set of labels to every mention of an entity without considering its local context. Existing FETC systems have two major drawbacks: assuming training data to be noise free and use of hand crafted features. Our work overcomes both drawbacks. We propose a neural network model that jointly learns entity mentions and their context representation to eliminate use of hand crafted features. Our model treats training data as noisy and uses non-parametric variant of hinge loss function. Experiments show that the proposed model outperforms previous stateof-the-art methods on two publicly available datasets, namely FIGER(GOLD) and BBN with an average relative improvement of 2.69% in micro-F1 score. Knowledge learnt by our model on one dataset can be transferred to other datasets while using same model or other FETC systems. These approaches of transferring knowledge further improve the performance of respective models.",
