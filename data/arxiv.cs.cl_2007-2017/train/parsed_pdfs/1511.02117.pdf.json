      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\nA new approach called SKYSET (Synthetic Knowledge\nYield Social Entities Translation) is proposed to validate completeness and to reduce ambiguity from written instructional documentation. SKYSET utilizes a quintuple set of standardized categories, which differs from traditional approaches that typically use triples. The SKYSET System defines the categories required to form a standard template for representing information that is portable across different domains. It provides a standardized framework that enables sentences from written instructions to be translated into sets of category typed entities on a table or database. The SKYSET entities contain conceptual units or phrases that represent information from the original source documentation. SKYSET enables information concatenation where multiple documents from different domains can be translated and combined into a single common filterable and searchable table of entities.\nIndex Terms – Cognitive Linguistics, Dual Intentional\nSemantic Decomposition and Reconstruction (DISDR), Frame Semantics, Information Concatenation, Information Integration, Information Summarization, Knowledge Architecture, Knowledge Management Internal External (KMIE), Metalinguistic Awareness, Synthetic Knowledge Yield Social Entities Translation (SKYSET).\n1. INTRODUCTION\nEinstein famously stated \"The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience\" [3].\nInstructional documentation suffers from a variety of maladies. These include a lack of commonality among processes across an enterprise, errors in documentation, ambiguity or vagueness in the way instructions were written [4], incomplete information, and complexity of directions. Communication of instructions is critical to any organized entity, whether it be a university, a medical clinic, a small business, or a large enterprise. A lack of process commonality or lack of standardization of documentation results in readers spending more time trying to make sense\nAdditionally, issues with instructional complexity and lack of commonality result in documentation that is difficult to maintain. Enterprises may suffer from multiple nearly identical processes being implemented and maintained in different departments instead of using a single common process across all departments. All these issues result in risks including monetary and scheduling costs.\nEven when instructional documentation does not contain errors, overhead costs still exist associated with readers spending time using the documentation. The easier documentation is to use, the less time readers need to spend using it, and the more time they can spend performing the business of the organization.\nPrevious approaches exist that attempt to address problems associated with written text, but these approaches have limitations and generally share similar traits. Our SKYSET (Synthetic Knowledge Yield Social Entities Translation) system is a new approach for addressing maladies encountered with the communication of written instructions. A minimal and low cost experiment was conceived and conducted with nine participants in order to perform a proof of concept for SKYSET. This paper will discuss the theory around SKYSET as well as the results of the preliminary proof of concept experiment with nine participants.\n2. BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS WORK\nIt should be noted that the SKYSET system is directly based upon the system previously called KMIE (Knowledge Management Internal External), which was created by Kerry Fultz in the 1990’s. In 2013 KMIE was enhanced further and became known as SKYSET. Further SKYSET development with a proof of concept for the system’s principles was performed in 2013. There has been no prior publication of SKYSET or KMIE. However, literature has been published that shares certain relevant characteristics with SKYSET and addresses problems associated with information.\n2.1 Classical Category Concepts\nFormalizations for information are not a modern innovation. Consider the following classical system in the context that it provides a framework for referencing information and explaining the world. The ancient classical Chinese system, the Wu Xing [13], incorporates five phases"

      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\n(Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal) that are sometimes referred to as five elements, agents, processes, or movements. The Wu Xing has historically been used in association with multiple domains ranging from traditional Chinese medicine, to martial arts, to astrology.\nThe aspect of relevance to this discussion is that this ancient system provides a standard template of categories that may be used to reference information from multiple domains. In traditional Chinese medicine, for example, different organs in the human body are specified as belonging to specific categories. Interactions between organs and diseases may be described in context to the Wu Xing. In a different domain, such as Chinese astrology, the same five categories may be associated along with an animal on the Chinese Zodiac to specify certain attributes and interactions. This classical system is known to date back over 2000 years to at least the time of the Han dynasty [13]. It is a historical example of a categorical template applied for classification across multiple domains.\n2.2 DNA, Building Blocks, and Language\nNext consider DNA. DNA or Deoxyribonucleic acid is commonly referred to as containing the building blocks of life. A DNA double helix contains four chemical bases that encode information which are Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G). Understanding of DNA provides insight that instructional content and complexity can be expressed through the use of a simple fundamental finite set of building blocks. Properly identifying these building blocks is critical to understanding the system.\nHuman language may be considered to have building blocks. Ideas expressed in language enable communication. The capability of harnessing language to label, classify, filter, and apply logic and reason with thoughts is paramount to achieving technical understanding of the world. Language behaves like a tool for thought analogous to the way a hammer is a tool for the hand. As a tool, written languages enable an expression of the building blocks of thought.\nIn some written languages, letters from an alphabetical system are used to represent words, while in other language systems, characters, radicals, or glyphs form words. However, phrases are constructed from sets of words, and can form written sentences. Sag, et al. [18] state that “Construction Grammarians all emphasize the importance of ... allowing units larger than the word as the building blocks of syntactic analysis”. The relevance of this will be discussed in Section 3 where it will be shown that SKYSET defines a particular standard set of fundamental building blocks that adhere to specific principles and are capable of representing written information from different domains.\n2.3 Frame Semantics and FrameNet\nFrame Semantics theory was developed by Charles J. Fillmore and his colleagues [5]. It is “the study of how, as a\npart of our knowledge of the language, we associate linguistic forms (words, fixed phrases, grammatical patterns) with the cognitive structures – the frames”. It is a theory of meaning [2] which states that “the meanings of most words can best be understood on the basis of a semantic frame... a description of a type of event, relation, or entity”.\nThe FrameNet project, located at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley [2], is based upon Frame Semantics. When applied to text, FrameNet’s purpose is to specify an appropriate frame, and to annotate sentences representing how a word or phrase evokes the frame. Each specified frame that is annotated is referred to as a frame element (FE). Example frame elements include Sleeper, Avenger, Cook, Food, Apply_Heat, and Heating_instrument. There are multitudes of frames that may exist to correspond with multitudes of sentences from different subjects.\n2.4 Linguistics Sentence Diagramming\nSentence diagramming [8] enables a simple and generic representation of parts from a sentence into components such as Noun, Verb – Object, etc. The utility of sentence diagramming by itself is limited in part because it is too generic to provide more detailed information about the meaning of written text. This technique can, however, serve as a low level operation to assist other techniques in processing written information.\n2.5 Controlled Natural Language (CNL)\nControlled Natural Language (CNL) [12] is a potential solution applied to instructional documentation in an effort to help reduce ambiguity and complexity. A Controlled Natural Language operates by using a subset of a natural language. In the CNL approach a restricted subset of words or grammars are permitted for use when authoring written instructions. As an example, a CNL may be applied to benefit and standardize clinical practice guidelines [21] in order to assist healthcare professionals. Due to the effort needed to write documentation that adheres to a particular CNL standard, automated grammar and style checking software tools [9] may be instituted to assist the authoring process.\n2.6 Resource Description Framework (RDF)\nThe Resource Description Framework (RDF) is standard that is maintained by the RDF Working Group [16]. They describe RDF as “…a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed”. RDF relies upon an abstract syntax that consists of sets of “triples” [15]. Each triple consists of a subject, predicate, and object."

      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\n2.7 ISO 15000-5:2014 - ebXML\nThe International Organization for Standardization’s Electronic Business Extensible Markup Language (ebXML) under ISO 15000-5:2014 defines a standardized approach to attempt to address information interoperability deficiencies between business applications. Their approach necessitates an interoperable way of standardizing Business Semantics [10]. ISO’s Core Components Specification (CCS) proposes two levels of abstraction. These are Core Components and Business Information Entities.\n2.8 Relative Abstraction of Approaches\nThe SKYSET system, which will be presented in Section 3, differs from previous approaches in that it uses categories containing entities with conceptual or phrase information. These SKYSET entities are at an abstraction level which is “in-between” other modalities. Hence, SKYSET operates in the “Goldilocks” zone where it is not too abstract and it is not too narrowly specific. SKYSET enables a standardized representation of written instructions from a multitude of sources. Figure 1 illustrates a notional relation between the level of abstraction and the level of restriction on languages and several associated approaches or frameworks.\nIn the diagram, HALO [6] refers to an “effort, sponsored by Vulcan Inc, aimed at creating the Digital Aristotle, an application that will encompass much of the world's scientific knowledge and be capable of applying sophisticated problem solving to answer novel questions.” Systems like HALO may interface with CNLs.\n3. THE SKYSET SYSTEM\nSKYSET distinguishes itself from other modalities by strict adherence to a specialized set of standard categories, which are usable across multiple domains. SKYSET\nencompasses a language format and a translation methodology. Translation of written instructions to SKYSET format involves the use of a new process that we call Dual Intentional Semantic Decomposition and Reconstruction (DISDR). The SKYSET translation process or DISDR (pronounced “decider”) extracts conceptual units of information from written text that are mapped to standard categories. The resulting SKYSET format consists of conceptual entities that may be stored in a spreadsheet or database. SKYSET represents relationships in context between the entities.\n3.1 SKYSET Standard Categories\nSKYSET assumes that there exists a specific finite set of domain agnostic standard categories that are the building blocks of information. These are called SKYSET Standard Categories. These fundamental categories are presented in Table 1. Please note that we did not use standard linguistic technical terms in our SKYSET experiment and research. The SKYSET terms used in this paper have different meanings and should not be confused with technical linguistic terminology.\nWritten instructions may be translated into arrays of entities that may be represented as rows of a table, matrix, spreadsheet, or database. A complete row or array has entities that are members of each of the SKYSET Standard Categories. An entity is blank or null when a sentence lacks information pertaining to a particular category.\nWhen applying SKYSET to documentation, some categories may be combined for simplification. An example possible quintuple with several combined categories (or table column header labels) is shown in Figure 2."

For purposes of clarity in this paper, portions of example instructional text have a color coded highlight that maps portions of the text to the appropriate corresponding color coded SKYSET category. A combined category such as Product/Resource may contain entities that belong to one or both of the respective categories.\n3.2 SKYSET Format Introductory Example\nAs an introductory example, consider the following\nsentence shown in Example 1a.\nExample 1a.

This translation of text to entities may be understood as providing answers to the following questions.\n What is the topic or role? Who is performing the action? In this text, the role is “A Scout Bee”.\n What action (service) is being performed? The service is “reports”.\n What product is being delivered, or resource used? In this case, the product is information,\nspecifically “the location of food”.\n How is the service being delivered? What process is being followed or what requirement is it\nfulfilling? What or who is the recipient of the service and or product? In this example, the process is “via the Waggle Dance” and the recipient is “to other scout bees”.\n When or under what conditions may the action occur? The answer is “upon return to the colony”.\nUsing the DISDR process, the text decomposes into conceptual units or entities that map to corresponding categories. The different color highlights shown below indicate the category type that each conceptual entity maps to.\nExample 1b. Text to be translated with highlights."

Hence, this text translates to the resultant SKYSET format as shown in Table 2.\nIn addition, SKYSET translation may optionally omit certain words such as definite and indefinite articles, plural or singular suffixes, etc. as deemed appropriate for the application. A simplified version is shown in Table 3.\npresented:\n1. The DISDR process decomposes text into conceptual entities by mapping entities to\nSKYSET Standard Categories and assembling the entities into a row of a table. Categories are the column header labels of the table. It was observed in the course of our research that sentences rarely contain information that maps entities to every SKYSET Standard Category. When an entity belonging to a category is not represented in a sentence, it is left blank or has a value of null.\n2. Two or more SKYSET Standard Categories (columns in the table) may become a set that is\nrepresented in the form of a single column. The order of columns can be rearranged.\n3. If the application warrants it, certain words such as definite and indefinite articles or suffixes may be\noptionally omitted from the SKYSET format representation."

      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\nAdditional SKYSET principles will be presented in the\nnext several examples.\n3.4 Ambiguity detection in text\nText is ambiguous when it contains a word, phrase, or sentence that can be interpreted to have more than one possible meaning. In their research, Zipke et al. [24] examined metalinguistic awareness involving semantic ambiguity detection. They note that metalinguistic awareness “is regarded as having special importance for helping students learn to decode words and to comprehend text”.\nMetalinguistic awareness, abbreviated MA, is “the ability to focus on and manipulate the formal properties of language - specifically, the ability to analyze, think about ... language as an object separate from its meaning in or out of context” [17].\nSwinney et al. [14] noted in their works that meaning selection is affected by context when readers need to process sentences that contain ambiguous words. However, the research of Shakibai [20] indicate that merely perceiving a homonym is not sufficient for ambiguity perception when reading a sentence. This means detecting a word that has multiple definitions does not necessarily equate to the reader perceiving an ambiguity. Nor does it necessarily resolve a potential ambiguity or misunderstanding for the reader of the text.\nSemantic ambiguities have the potential to adversely affect documentation with critical instructions interpreted to have meanings that are different from those the author of the instructions intended. SKYSET requires a formal categorization of written instructions, so ambiguities may become more readily identifiable during the translation process. In addition, mapping text appropriately to the conceptual entities potentially enables disambiguation.\nThe next example illustrates the property of SKYSET that enables structural ambiguity detection and resolution for written documentation.\nExample 2. Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nThe instructor listens to the medical student with the stethoscope during class.\nThis sentence can have more than one interpretation.\n Case 1: The instructor uses the stethoscope as a tool for examining the medical student.\n Case 2: The instructor hears the words spoken by the medical student. The medical student wears the\nstethoscope.\nAn alternative approach, like CNL, would necessitate replacement of words or limit the dictionary or grammar to clarify the meaning. However, unlike the CNL approach,\nSKYSET uses categories to identify and specify precise meaning. Using the SKYSET approach, in Case 1 the stethoscope is a resource used by the instructor to help perform a service. In Case 2, the recipient category is the medical student with the stethoscope. The corresponding possible SKYSET representations are shown in Table 8 with Case 1 and Case 2 on different rows. The author of the instructions or an appropriate knowledgeable expert would clarify which meaning needs to be represented symbolically in the written instructions using quasi-morphism logic [19]. Note that in this example, some columns swap order.\nAs another example of ambiguous instructional text demonstrating a comparison between the SKYSET approach and a CNL approach, consider the following:\nExample 3. Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nThe painter looks over the wall.\nPotential meanings include: 1. The painter examines the wall. 2. The painter focuses his or her visual field of view\nover the top of the wall to see what is on the other side of the wall.\nThe differences between these two meanings is important. In case 1, the instructions may need the painter to inspect the object he is working on. In case 2, the painter may need to see who or what might be on the other side of the wall before he begins spray painting. The translation to SKYSET format is shown in Table 5.\nthe context of the instructions.\nConsider the following example. Suppose that the instructions are to train a new waiter or waitress (also known as the “server”) at a formal dining establishment. The new server carries four utensils, which are a long fork, a short fork, a spoon, and a knife. The new server is completely unfamiliar with formal dining protocols, so the"

      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\nmanagement creates an instructional document to guide the server step by step. An excerpt of the instructional text and the associated SKYSET format are presented below.\nExample 4. Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nThe server places the utensil on the napkin beside the guest when the salad arrives.\nUpon translation, when looking in the Product/Resource column, it becomes obvious that the word “utensil” is too vague and does not specify one of the four items (long fork, short fork, spoon, or knife) that the server carries. The knowledge that the short fork is for salads is known to the author of the instructions; however, the instructions are not explicit for someone who lacks that prior knowledge. A logical analysis of the SKYSET entities could help the author identify such issues and revise the instructions before they are published, distributed, and used. A proper revision of these directions in SKYSET format is shown below.\nfrom the context of the instructions.\nConsider the following standard text and associated\nSKYSET format.\nExample 5. Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nThe professor should distribute the assignment before class begins.\nNotice that one of the categories is left blank because information about how to distribute the assignment and who to distribute it to was not specified in the instructional text. In this regard, SKYSET provides a mechanism for detection of potentially omitted instructional information. If\nfor a given application, the process does not matter or is left up to the professor, then this omission from the instructional text may be acceptable. On the other hand, if the process is important, then the author of the instructions may identify the missing information and correct the text.\n3.7 Many-to-One\nMultiple sentences of text may translate into a single SKYSET row. When considering the nature of the framework with the standardized category style of representation, this many-to-one translation capability is a distinguishing aspect of SKYSET.\nSuppose the class from the prior example text is taught virtually and the author of these instructions decides that the assignment must be distributed by email. Furthermore, suppose that the professor should send the instructions to the teaching assistants before class begin. Assume more than one sentence may be used for the information in the written instructions. The revised standard text is presented in Example 6. The equivalent translation into SKYSET format is shown in Table 9.\nExample 6. Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nThe professor should distribute the assignment to the teaching assistants before class begins. Note that distribution should be done by email.\nNote that when related information from standard text spans multiple sentences, understanding it requires linking conceptual units of the information together using spatial reference in the human mind. This information encoding causes the information to go into units related by verbs to bring the meaning of one or more arguments into scope in order to understand the text. However, SKYSET already performs the spatial reference for the reader via the entities and their word or phrase order.\n3.8 One-to-Many\nOne sentence of text may translate into several SKYSET rows. This multiple row form can be especially useful to separate out individual requirements or conditions from sentences. Consider the following standard text and associated SKYSET format shown in Example 7 and Table 10. Note that the two SKYSET rows differ only by the entities in the Condition column."

Text to be translated into SKYSET format.\nIn accordance with the course syllabus, the student should fill out a critique assessment form after the art is showcased in class or after a field trip to the museum.\nThe ability of a SKYSET entity to switch association from one category to a different category depending upon the relevant context is a property that we call mutability. SKYSET mutability enables role switching for words, phrases and concepts within the SKYSET framework. To demonstrate mutability, consider Example 8 and the corresponding SKYSET format in Table 11. The school library entity changes category association depending upon the context.\nR o\nw TOPIC/ ROLE SERVICE PRODUCT/ RESOURCE PROCESS/ REQ/RECIPIENT CONDITION\n1 construction workers build school library - during the summer 2 students study school library\nin order to pass the exam In the autumn\n3 school library provides shelter - during the winter\nNotice that on Row 1, the school library is a product produced by the construction workers. However, when students use the school library, in Row 2, it becomes a resource. In Row 3, it is the topic.\n3.10 Standardized Representation of Meaning\nAnother principle to note is that the SKYSET translation can be specified to favor active instead of passive voice. In agreement with Frame Semantics and the FrameNet system’s concepts, we note that linguistic structure involves\nconceptual frames [5]. SKYSET’s conceptual framework is able to present a particular standard frame for application to written instructions. A standardized representation enables sentences with identical meanings to have one common SKYSET representation.\nTo present this principle, the three sentences from Example 9 have identical meaning. The single corresponding SKYSET translation, shown in Table 12, is a valid translation for each of the three sentences.\nTOPIC/ ROLE SERVICE PRODUCT/ RESOURCE PROCESS/ REQ/RECIPIENT\nCONDITION\nstudent fills test tube with water when instructed\nAspects of the distinguishing principles of SKYSET that have been presented thus far warrant further discussion. SKYSET enables roles that are independent which is in agreement with the cognitive linguistics style approach similar to FrameNet [2]. FrameNet creates a representation of the actual semantic frames that describe the context for which there are hundreds or thousands of potentially different semantic frames.\nHowever, SKYSET takes a different approach from FrameNet. SKYSET postulates that it only has to assume the finite set of SKYSET Standard Categories (usually applied as a quintuple) to represent written instructions in the SKYSET format. While FrameNet has strength in its ability to capture the frame element information, it lacks a simple reusable standard template for representing categories across multiple domains due to the use of hundreds of different frame elements. In contrast, SKYSET does not attempt to capture the frame element information. Instead SKYSET focuses on capturing the conceptual entity information using the finite set of SKYSET Standard Categories as a common template that is useable across multiple domains.\nOf particular relevance to the discussion of an applied system like SKYSET is an observation described by Awodey [1] in his 2015 paper. He states that “One thing missing... has been a notion of model that is both faithful to the precise formalism... and yet general and flexible enough to be a practical tool for semantic investigations”. Hence, research has been performed and theories investigated. However, an applied approach that is practical has been elusive."

      "heading" : "Introducing SKYSET - a Quintuple Kerry Fultz and Seth Filip Page 8 of 11",
      "text" : "Approach for Improving Instructions\nAbstract theories or generic triple approaches such as RDF have limitations in regard to their practical application. SKYSET, in contrast, defines and applies the specific SKYSET categories, typically as a quintuple template. SKYSET entities preserve information framed in context with the source instructional text. This enables the SKYSET framework to represent information at an abstraction level that facilitates practical application as a standardized format across domains.\nThe ISO 15000-5:2014 Core Component contains a concept that partially shares some resemblance with KMIE’s/SKYSET’s internal and external boundary concept that was conceived in the 1990’s where business related information is included (internal) and extraneous information is excluded (external) from the KMIE/ SKYSET system.\n3.11 Information Concatenation and Integration\nA key feature of SKYSET is that it identifies a finite set of categories which specify a standard template applicable to written instructions from varying subject areas. For example, the same SKYSET categories may be used to represent information from a baking instructions document and a philosophy debate team’s procedural document. Furthermore, the categories are sufficiently detailed in scope as to be of enhanced value for relating information between phrasal entities. To demonstrate this, the following example is presented already in SKYSET format shown in Table 13.\nIn this example, each row is from a different written source document: Row 1 is from a Philosophy Debate Team Charter, Row 2 is from a Baking Class Syllabus, and Row 3 is from School Graduation Requirements documentation. Suppose all three documents were translated into SKYSET format. It becomes evident that for a specific role, it would be straightforward to filter by SKYSET category or search for the subset of information that would apply directly to a particular student. If a student were part of the Philosophy debate team, planning to be a Music major and not taking the baking class, then only two rows would apply from the example table.\nThe property of SKYSET to concatenate information from many instructional source documents into a single table or database enables Information Integration. Wache, et al. [23] identify that Information Integration is necessary to contribute to addressing the interoperability problem associated with the accessibility of heterogeneous and distributed information.\n3.12 Translation from SKYSET to Sentences\nThe SKYSET format may be translated back to represent the information as standard text sentences. The SKYSET format may almost be read from left to right to reconstruct a sentence with some potential word insertions or verb conjugations if applicable to the language being used. How translation back to standard sentences is performed is selected by the translator. For instance, a sentence may be translated to use active voice or passive voice as chosen by the translator. Hence, the reconstruction is tunable.\n4. PRELIMINARY SKYSET EXPERIMENT\nA preliminary SKYSET experiment was conducted with nine participants in order to obtain an initial estimation of the speed and accuracy of the new SKYSET format compared with the traditionally styled business process instructions document format. The traditional business process instructions document format is subsequently referred to as the document format.\n4.1 Methodology and Procedure\nPrior to the experiment, several document format written instructions were translated into SKYSET format. No personally identifiable information was kept on the participants. Individuals from nearby work areas volunteered their break time to participate by taking a four question exam.\nEach participant was provided with a written exam. Each exam contained four questions. The length of time elapsed for a participant to attempt to answer each exam question was measured. Additionally, there was a 300 second time limit restriction for attempting to answer each question. The questions required the participants to answer using either the SKYSET format (spreadsheet containing SKYSET entities) or the document format (regular document style with sentences) as the source instructions.\nTwo of the four questions (one for SKYSET format and one for document format) asked the participant to find information about a single data point, such as a single word or phrase search. The other two questions (one for SKYSET format and one for document format) asked the participant to find information over multiple data points, where the reader needs to find and relate information about multiple words or phrases in context simultaneously in order to answer the question. The questions are identified as Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and are summarized as follows."

The measured elapsed time to answer each question (Q1-Q4) is displayed in seconds.\nThis results indicate that a multiple data point search using the SKYSET format is on average over five times faster (5.3 times faster) than using the document format.\nFigure 3 shows a chart that displays the average elapsed times in seconds and the standard deviation. It shows four columns, one for each of the four exam questions.\nThe left two columns represent the average elapsed time spent to answer a question requiring a single data point search using the SKYSET format and the document format respectively. The right two columns represent the average elapsed time spent to answer a question requiring a multiple data point search using the SKYSET format and the document format respectively.\nThere were two occurrences where test takers failed to answer a question within the time allotted because the experiment imposed a 300 second time limit per question. In both of these failures, the document format source material was being used. On the other hand, no failures to correctly answer a test question were observed when the source material was in SKYSET format.\n5. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nWe realize that the small number of nine test participants is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions. As discussed previously, SKYSET already provides the spatial reference for the reader. Consequently, we hypothesized that SKYSET would enable faster searching over multiple points of data. When presented with a question that requires relating multiple pieces of information, filtering or sorting by SKYSET categories enabled participants to quickly find and relate information from the SKYSET rows in order to obtain the correct answer. The observed results showed a 5.3 times speed improvement when using the SKYSET format instead of the document format.\nConversely, SKYSET did not show a significant difference from the document format when searching over a single point of data, such as using the built in search feature to locate a single word. The measured data appears to support this hypothesis. It should be emphasized again that these results are based upon only nine volunteer participants, so no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Nevertheless, it provides an initial preview of SKYSET that warrants further study to determine the validity of realizing hypothesized benefits from SKYSET.\n5.1 Significance of the Results\nTo determine the statistical significance of the results, Tukey's Honest Significant Difference [7] (Tukey's HSD) test was preformed. Tukey's HSD was used to evaluate which questions are significantly different from the others. The results of Tukey's HSD test are presented in Table 15. The measured data from Question Q4 shows a significant difference from the other three questions. Moreover, questions Q1, Q2, and Q3 demonstrated no significant difference from each other. This implies that there is no measured significant difference between the SKYSET format and the document format for a Single Data Point search. Furthermore, these results imply that Multiple Data Point search times were measured to improve to be nearly"

      "text" : "Within the context of the nine person experiment, sorting by SKYSET categories was observed to produce faster answer times for the SKYSET format (Q3) when compared with the times from the document format (Q4).\n6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nSKYSET defines a standard set of categories that are applicable as a template across multiple domains. The preliminary proof-of-concept experiment with nine participants was observed to produce an approximate 5 times speed improvement for multiple data point searches when using the SKYSET format compared with conventional instructional documentation. A speed improvement could translate into reductions in the time required to understand and follow instructions and could be indicative of clearer instructions. However, the number of experiment participants was too low to allow for any definitive conclusions. Furthermore, if this experiment were repeated with additional participants, we would need to account for the variable of the source format itself (spreadsheet versus PDF document). One potential option is to print a paper copy of the SKYSET format as a table and compare it to a paper copy of a corresponding document with sentences. Such an experiment would control for the differences between using computer applications like Excel (for SKYSET) and PDF (for the document). More studies are needed to ascertain any hypothetical benefits of SKYSET.\nThe observed capability of SKYSET to assist with identifying deficient documentation could help prevent mistakes that lead to malpractice or rework. SKYSET has the capability to concatenate information from many instructional source documents from different domains into a single table. Areas for future research with SKYSET are numerous. These include, but are not limited to, the following areas.\n Developing and refining efficient software algorithms that utilize DISDR to translate written information to\nor from the SKYSET format.\n Researching the effectiveness of SKYSET for validation of instructional documentation. This would\ninclude evaluating the effectiveness of assisting authors with detecting and resolving ambiguous, vague, or incomplete text. It could also project monetary savings by estimating the costs saved as the result of preventing malpractice or re-work.\n Research that compares SKYSET with a CNL.\n Research combining SKYSET with a CNL, where the CNL specifies the appropriate words for determining a\nunique representation of sentences with identical meanings.\n Researching the utility of translating text to the SKYSET format and then translating it back to a\nconventional document. The research could include development of parameters that are varied to produce text possessing specific stylistic traits, such as sentences with active or passive voice.\n Researching the benefits of SKYSET for information summarization and information integration.\nInformation Summarization refers to the ability of a system to create a summary of a document's contents. Summarization is possible with SKYSET because it stores information as entities in filterable categories that can be counted and grouped to identify likely important key points from instructional text.\n Researching the capability of the SKYSET format to improve learning speed, accuracy, and knowledge\nretention through clearer documentation.\nSKYSET has the potential to reduce ambiguity, complexity, and deficiencies associated with written instructions; however, more studies are needed to definitively prove the potential benefits. Nevertheless, the development and application of standardized formats such as SKYSET, RDF, and ISO 15000-5:2014 have the potential to foster improvements in written communication that benefit academia and other organizations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors express their gratitude to all who have supported this research on its journey, including special mention to the following. Len Quadracci of Boeing Research and Technology for providing invaluable advice and support of our research. Joe Hightower, for his expertise and statistical analysis of experimental data.

The SKYSET System defines the categories required to form a standard template for representing information that is portable across different domains. It provides a standardized framework that enables sentences from written instructions to be translated into sets of category typed entities on a table or database. The SKYSET entities contain conceptual units or phrases that represent information from the original source documentation. SKYSET enables information concatenation where multiple documents from different domains can be translated and combined into a single common filterable and searchable table of entities.
