However, for agents to intelligently interact with humans, simply capturing the statistical patterns is insufficient. In this paper we investigate if, and how, grounded compositional language can emerge as a means to achieve goals in multi-agent populations. Towards this end, we propose a multi-agent learning environment and learning methods that bring about emergence of a basic compositional language. This language is represented as streams of abstract discrete symbols uttered by agents over time, but nonetheless has a coherent structure that possesses a defined vocabulary and syntax. We also observe emergence of non-verbal communication such as pointing and guiding when language communication is unavailable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:30:13 GMT  (1262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04908v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["igor mordatch", "pieter abbeel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04908"}
