      "text" : "This paper addresses the problem of classifier aggregation through the use of Machine Learning Markets. In supervised machine learning, many algorithms use simple averaging, weighted averaging, mixtures, mixing and log opinion pools for combining a variety of classifiers to form aggregate classifiers. On the other hand, prediction markets have been used for aggregation of simple beliefs in other fields (the market price is used as an aggregate probability). Some simple forms of theoretical prediction markets have been shown to be equivalent to weighted averaging (Barbu & Lay, 2011; Storkey, 2011). However, more generally, we can formulate prediction market mechanisms on the\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nbasis of expected utility theory. We show that a whole spectrum of aggregation methods are then available, including and extending those provided by α-mixtures. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of these aggregation methods over those discussed above.\nA number of authors have recently examined the possibilities of market mechanisms for implementing machine learning methods. Desirable properties of markets include the fact that agents act independently, markets are inherently parallelisable and the fact that the form of models produced by markets is more general than explicitly defined probabilistic models. Market based machine learning approaches are being shown to be consistent with standard probabilistic machine learning formalisms (Storkey, 2011) as well providing regret bounds for market makers (Chen & Wortman Vaughan, 2010; Abernethy et al., 2011). Markets are also a well studied and pervasive part of our social and computational infrastructure.\nWe envisage the possibility of setting up online prediction markets for large scale multivariate prediction problems in which different algorithms compete. This generalises prediction markets, which usually focus on disconnected discrete events, and relates to other recent work in utilising algorithm crowdsourcing for machine learning (Abernethy & Frongillo, 2011). It would provide an alternative to, say, the current interest in competition and challenge environments (e.g. Netflix, Kaggle, PASCAL2), where individuals compete for the best personal performance. Experience in these domains has suggested that it is common for individual algorithms to be outperformed by competitors grouping together to produce model combinations (Bell & Koren, 2007). This mirrors the experience regarding aggregation of expert predictions (Dani et al., 2006).\nThe main novel contributions of this paper are:\n• Extending the set of standard agents from logarithmic agents and exponential agents to also include the various forms of isoelastic agents, and to show such agents can reproduce and extend the α-mixtures framework (Amari, 2007).\n• Demonstrating that online and batch agent wealth updates are equivalent to Bayesian posterior updates and mixture coefficient updates re-\nspectively.\n• Equating the multi-agent equilibrium (fixedpoint) market with a divergence minimisation. The result is an iterative process for establishing the market equilibrium values.\n• Demonstrating that Machine Learning Markets outperform individual strong classifiers when presented with equivalent data. Showing that the markets improve on state of the art classifiers, such as random forests, and provide better logprobability performance on classification test sets.\n• Demonstrating that inhomogeneous sets of isoelastic agents produce better performance than logarithmic agents. Hence aggregation by simple mixtures can be improved upon."

      "text" : "A number of previous papers address machine learning and prediction markets. In (Lay & Barbu, 2010) and (Barbu & Lay, 2011), the authors consider agents endowed with betting functions, and do experimental tests in the context of classifiers (leaves of the trees of a random forest) trained on bootstrapped samples. In (Storkey, 2011) the author develops a complementary approach, utilizing beliefs and utilities of individual agents. He shows that a variety of machine learning model combination methods, including model averaging, product models, factor graphs etc. can be implemented using Machine Learning Markets. In (Chen & Wortman Vaughan, 2010) the market is defined with respect to a global cost function, and they demonstrate achieving ‘no regret’ learning using information markets. From another perspective, Agrawal et al. (Agrawal et al., 2010) looked at the equilibrium conditions of prediction markets in various situations of matching buyers and sellers. The available information is important for market conditions. This was discussed in (Jumadinova & Dasgupta, 2011), where they used a multi-agent system to examine the various dependencies on information reliability, rate etc. It is the ability of prediction markets to aggregate belief that is key to their potential (Pennock & Wellman, 1997; Ottaviani & Sørensen, 2007), and much of the experimental work on prediction markets backs that up (Ledyard & Hanson, 2008).\nThe potential of prediction markets has been considered for some time. In (Arrow et al., 2008; Manski, 2006; Wolfers & Zitzewitz, 2004) the authors discuss the capability of practical prediction markets to capture accurate probabilities. In (Dani et al., 2006) the authors compared a number of different mechanisms for expert aggregation including a simple prediction market approach. Different market designs have different features, and ensuring good prediction market design with sufficient fluidity (Brahma et al., 2010)\nwill be critical for efficiently reaching equilibrium. In (Tseng et al., 2010) the authors examine the statistical properties of market agent models, whereas in (Lee & Moretti, 2009) the authors consider prediction markets in the context of Bayesian learning."

Likewise, we can require all agents to spend all their wealth: if any agent wants to keep it as a risk free investment, that agent can simply purchase one of each stock instead. Hence, without loss of generality, we have∑\nk\nrik = Wi. (1)\nAgain without loss of generality, we will measure wealth in units such that the total wealth across all agents is 1: ∑ iWi = 1.

For the purposes of this paper we will only consider concave utility functions. Finally, each agent has a belief Pi, where Pi(k) denotes the probabilistic belief, for that particular agent i, that the outcome of k will be k. Necessarily, as k enumerates all possible outcomes,∑ k Pi(k) = 1 for all agents.\n1Strictly, the probability is ck divided by the unit of payout. This ensures dimensional consistency, both here and elsewhere.\n2No arbitrage: there is no opportunity for a risk free gain.

The isoelastic utilities get their name as they all have investment functions that are linear in the current wealth; this property is called the isoelastic property.

      "heading" : "4.2. Market Equilibrium",
      "text" : "The Market must satisfy the market constraint (2). At the same time each agent attempts to maximise their individual utility. It is well known (Arrow & Debreu, 1954) that, if the individual utilities are concave (as is the case in this paper), there is a unique fixed price point for which agents all attain their maximum utility and the market constraints are satisfied. This is called the market equilibrium. However, the existence of a fixed point does not establish a means of obtaining it. The question of how a market might equilibrate formed part of the early discussion regarding equilibria, and led to Walras’ concept of tâtonnement. This idea, as communicated by Samuelson (Samuelson, 1947), was that prices are differentially changed in the direction of the excess or deficit demand. However, the constraints on this formalism meant it was not established as a general purpose procedure. The are many analyses that involve formulating convex optimisation approaches or auction processes for obtaining market equilibria, e.g. (Deng et al., 2002; Devanur et al., 2008; Ye, 2006) – see (Vazirani, 2007) for more details. These algorithms typically require a complete optimisation procedure. Two exceptions are (Cole & Fleischer, 2007; Fleischer et al., 2008) which develop on the idea of tâtonnement.\nIn this paper an iterative tâtonnement-like approach is used for establishing market equilibria. Consider the fact that ∑ k ck = 1 and ∑ k( ∑ i rik) = 1 means\nthat both ck and ∑ i rik take probabilistic form. At\nequilibrium, we have ∑ i rik = ck (see (2)) when all agents are allocated their optimal demand. Away from equilibrium there will be an excess or deficit demand in different goods, which is evident in the difference between ∑ i rik and ck. Consider the KL divergence\nKL(c|| ∑ i ri). This is minimised and zero only at equilibrium. To minimise this KL divergence we use Algorithm 1. This algorithm only terminates when the (unique) equilibrium is reached, when c is the equilibrium price. In all our empirical tests the equilibrium was always reached. Each pass of the algorithm is naively O(NA×NG) – each update is computationally equivalent to a mixture model update. In our experiments equilibria were reached in between 5 and 15 iterations.\nSatisfaction of the market constraints for given buying functions, or equivalently minimisation of KL(c|| ∑ i ri), defines a fixed point that is a market equilibrium. These market equilibria can be explicitly computed for various agent utilities. For a market of identical logarithmic agents or a market of identical exponential agents we have\nck =\n∑ iWiPi(k)∑\niWi and ck ∝ NA∏ i=1 Pi(k) 1 NA , (6)\nExponential U(W ) = − exp(−W ) rik(Wi, c) = WiNG + ck log Pi(k) ck − 1NG ∑ k′ ck′ log Pi(k ′) ck′\nLogarithmic U(W ) = { log(W ) for W > 0 −∞ otherwise rik(Wi, c) = WiPi(k)\nIsoelastic U(W ) = W 1−ηi−1 1−ηi rik = Wi  (ck) ηi−1ηi (Pi(k)) 1ηi∑ k′(ck′) ηi−1 ηi (Pi(k′)) 1 ηi \nTable 1.

For logarithmic agents this takes the form of a model average or mixture of the agents’ beliefs; for exponential agents it is a log opinion pool of beliefs.

      "heading" : "4.3. Equilibria for Isoelastic Agents",
      "text" : "We cannot explicitly obtain the equilibrium for sets of isoelastic agents with η 6= 1, and so the optimisation procedure of the previous section needs to be employed. However we can say something about the form of solution we obtain for isoelastic agents. For example we can obtain the following equilibrium for homogeneous markets of isoelastic agents, all having the same η. This solution is not closed form:\nck = [∑ i ViPi(k) 1 η ]η (7)\nwhere Vi = Wi/Zi and Zi is the implicit solution to\nZi = ∑ k ∑ j Wj Zj Pj(k) 1 η η−1 Pi(k) 1η . (8) Equation (7) is precisely the equation for α-mixtures (Amari, 2007; Wu, 2009), but where Vi is defined implicitly in terms of a set of weights (or wealths) Wi. This particular expression for α-mixtures is interesting because of the isoelastic property: if a single component from the α-mixture is replaced by two iden-\ntical components with weight Wi/2, it results in exactly the same model. The precise number of components/agents does not matter, just the total wealth associated with each belief, regardless of the how many components share it. Hence, the wealths provide the natural measure for the mixing coefficients of an αmixture. This property does not hold for the Vi in Equation (7), except if η = 1, when Vi = Wi.\nFigure 1 illustrates the distinction between an isoelastic market combination and a logarithmic combination (which is equivalent to a standard mixture). In the isolelastic market, for η > 1, the individual beliefs are ‘squashed’ (raised to a fractional power) before being mixed, and are then ‘unsquashed’ again after mixing. The result of this is the areas of agreement between agents are emphasised relative to a standard mixture.\nAs an alternative to (7), we can also write ck = ∑ i WiP η ik(c) (9) where P ηik(c) is defined as\nP ηik(c) = ck\n( Pi(k) ck )1/η ∑ k′ ck′ ( Pi(k′) ck′\n)1/η . (10) Again this is not closed form, but expresses the equilibrium ck as a weighted sum of the effective beliefs P η ik that are associated with each agent once the impact of the combination with rest of the market is taken into account. Each effective belief is weighted by the agent’s wealth Wi before aggregation.\nIn the discussion above, all the agents have utilities with the same value of η. This is a homogeneous market structure. However there is no restriction to homogeneity in the context of Machine Learning Markets. Here an inhomogeneous market structure can be used where different agents have different η values. Hence the equilibria of Machine Learning Markets can implement a broader set of combination processes than standard α-mixtures, and so generalises the α-mixture formalism. We show in Section 6 that the use of an inhomogeneous market structure provides improvements over standard mixtures for a variety of standard machine learning benchmarks."

The agents make purchases in predictions across the whole training dataset, trading with the other agents. Payouts are then made and each agent makes a return on the investment. Agents that invest well (relatively) gain wealth, whereas agents that invest in goods that don’t pay out lose wealth and hence market influence.

For logarithmic agents the belief P η ikt\n= Pi(kt) and this just reduces to a Bayes update, treating each agent as an independent probabilistic model. For isoelastic agents it is still a Bayes update, but where Bayes rule uses the effective beliefs P ηikt as the component distributions, instead of the individual agent belief Pi(kt). The equilibrium cost ct for any item at time t after seeing data DT is a standard Bayesian model average, given by (9), as the weights are the posterior probabilities associated with each agent (12).\nThe fact that these Bayesian updates occur for logarithmic utilities (or equivalently log-loss) has been discussed in a different context in (Beygelzimer et al., 2012).

In those settings Bayesian model averaging is inappropriate. Rather, we may believe the data is best described by a mixture of probabilities, and we wish to determine optimal mixing proportions.\nConsider, instead, splitting the agent wealth equally across test cases, and requiring the agents to place bets on all test cases at once. In this case the wealth updates are equivalent to a single step of the mixture component updates. Specifically the return from considering data item t is\nP (i|t) def= WiP\nη ikt (c)∑ i′Wi′P η i′k(c) .

For large multiclass data, we used the Letter Recognition dataset. The markets of random forests were built using the Matlab random forest implementation, treebagger, with 20 decision trees pruned by requiring a minimum of ten of observations per tree leaf. Individual decision trees were extracted from the random forest after it has been trained on all of the training data, and were used to generate each of the 20 agents’ beliefs. In our comparisons, market wealths were adapted on the complete training set with 1 training epoch. 30 iterations of each test were performed\n3Available at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\nto generate meaningful statistics, with data being randomly permuted before each test. The same series of random seeds were used for each iteration of each test in order to fairly compare different utility functions. Wealth updates were performed using the batch mechanism described in Section 5.1.2.\nInhomogeneous isoelastic markets were created by sampling values for η using (η − 1) ∼ Γ(k, θ), with shape parameter k = 3 and scale parameter θ = 1. This produces a diverse set of η values for different agents, while ensuring η > 1. More risk averse utility functions (η > 1) were chosen as they emphasise regions of agreement between agents rather than regions of disagreement (see (7) and Figure 1).\nThe primary purpose of this analysis is to test different possible probabilistic combination methods against other single classifiers.
