Broader spans are set to reduce such side effect.\nHowever, regardless of such drawback, 3D SOM performs well in basic clustering,\nfor the CORs between hits and input remain at a high level, which are not troubled by205\nsuch limitation. And the number of nodes matches with number of input in each layer. And according to Figure 2 and 3, nodes’ distribution is consistent to input’s density.\nIn multi-period analysis, results confirmed that 3D SOM could trace both daily and weekly pattern effectively. Beyond that, when projected into day-week plane, map discovers the correlation between two periods themselves. From Figure 4, it can be210\nseen when crime incidents peaked changed as day passing by and nodes of map moved accordingly. It provides a new basis for multi-period analysis, that if split the nesting interval into matrix, much more information can be gathered together without loss of short terms details. When it comes to categorical data, if we focus how the performance in reflecting215\neach type, COR for each ID is strongly influenced by how many input belongs to that ID, for major types map fit well with input. However, because of the winner-take-all strategy, hardly any node is allocated to infrequent crimes with ID 1,7. Then I tried updating method based on the probability of each ID in weight matrix W , yet it fails to solve the problem and lead to decreased reliability. Detail on this method is supplied220\nin Appendix B2. Linear regression analysis shows that it’s almost inevitable due to contrast between sparsity of nodes and density of input.\nWhile the results are promising in basic clustering, as the dimension increases, it’s troublesome to judge whether a centroid locate at a namely right position. To be more concrete, when studying crime incidents, should the nodes move closer to input with225\nsame type of crime, or to data with less geographic distance? When adding IDvariables into clustering, CORs in temporal-spatial subspace decreased. Moreover, there are some unsolved theoretical problem[8] in self-organizing map itself[9], prohibiting us to employ an universal standard to evaluate results. Besides, this paper concentrates on patterns and relationship within the data, it’s230\npossible that temporal-spatial distributions are caused by factors not included, such as population, police force and so forth, leaving room for research to find potential causality.\nConclusion\nThree-dimensional self organizing map is competent and versatile in clustering and235\nidentifying behavioral patterns. Framework of grid reflects topographic feature of input, while codebook vectors store detailed information. Facilitated with an innovative methodology that expands timeline into matrix, 3D SOM unravels pattern and interrelation masked in multiple periods. Besides, a tailored 3D SOM clarifies complex relations in heterogeneous data, wisely avoiding calculation without analytical mean-240\ning.\nIn brief, what this paper seeks to address is not one or two specific clusterings of data contains time and geographic elements, but interpretation of interior relationships between variables based on temporal-spatial distribution. Self-organizing map is constructive for comprehension of high dimensional structures, providing an operable tool245\nin functional utilization.\nAppendix"

When the input vectors consists of time, latitude and longitude, the map can be strongly linked to physical world, providing valuable information. Beyond basic clustering, a novel approach to address the temporal element is developed, enabling 3D SOM to track behaviors in multiple periods concurrently. Combined with adaptations targeting to process heterogeneous data relating to distribution in time and space, the paper offers a fresh scope for business and services based on temporal-spatial pattern.",
