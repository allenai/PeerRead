      "text" : "Text categorization is the task of automatically assigning pre-defined categories to documents written in natural languages. Several types of text categorization have been studied, each of which deals with different types of documents and categories, such as topic categorization to detect discussed topics (e.g., sports, politics), spam detection (Sahami et al., 1998), and sentiment classification (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2008; Maas et al., 2011) to determine the sentiment typically in product or movie reviews. A standard approach to text categorization is to represent documents by bag-of-word vectors, namely, vectors that indicate which words appear in the documents but do not preserve word order, and use classification models such as SVM.\nIt has been noted that loss of word order caused by bag-of-word vectors (bow vectors) is particularly problematic on sentiment classification. A simple remedy is to use word bi-grams in addition to unigrams (Blitzer et al., 2007; Glorot et al., 2011; Wang and Manning, 2012). However, use of word n-grams with n > 1 on text categorization in general is not always effective; e.g., Wang and Manning (2012) report that use of tri-grams on sentiment classification slightly hurt performance; on topic categorization, simply adding phrases or n-grams is not effective (see, e.g., references in (Tan et al., 2002)).\nTo benefit from word order on text categorization, we take a different approach, which employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1986). CNN is a neural network that can make use of the internal structure of data such as the 2D structure of image data through convolution layers, where each computation unit responds to a small region of input data (e.g., a small square of a large image). We apply CNN to text categorization to make use of the 1D structure (word order) of document data so that each unit in the convolution layer responds to a small region of a document (a sequence of words).\nCNN has been very successful on image classification; see e.g., the winning solutions of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014; Russakovsky et al., 2014).\nOn text, since the work on token-level applications (e.g., POS tagging) by Collobert et al. (2011), CNN has been used in systems for entity search, sentence modeling, word embedding learning, product feature mining, and so on (Gao et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014; Kim, 2014).\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n10 58\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 D\nec 2\n01 4\nNotably, in many of these CNN studies on text, the first layer of the network converts words in sentences to word vectors by table lookup. The word vectors are either trained as part of CNN training, or fixed to those learned by some other method (e.g., word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013)) from an additional large corpus. The latter is a form of semi-supervised learning, which we study elsewhere. We are interested in the effectiveness of CNN itself without aid of additional resources; therefore, word vectors should be trained as part of network training if word vector lookup is to be done.\nA question arises, however, whether word vector lookup in a purely-supervised setting is really useful for text categorization. The essence of convolution layers is to convert text regions of a fixed size (e.g., “am so happy” with size 3) to feature vectors, as described later. In that sense, a word vector learning layer is a special (and unusual) case of convolution layer with region size one. Why is size one appropriate if bi-grams are more discriminating than uni-grams? Hence, we take a different approach. We directly apply CNN to high-dimensional one hot vectors. This approach is made possible by solving the computational issue1 through efficient handling of high-dimensional sparse data on GPU, and it turned out to have the merits of improving accuracy, simplifying the system (fewer hyper-parameters to tune), and speeding up training/prediction significantly. Speed up is due to the fact that convolution over high-dimensional one-hot vectors is much less expensive than convolution over dense word vectors, when sparse data is handled efficiently. This high-speed CNN code for text will be made publicly available.\nWe study the effectiveness of CNN on text categorization and explain why CNN is suitable for the task. Two types of CNN are tested: seq-CNN is a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, and bow-CNN is a simple but new variation of CNN that employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer. The experiments show that seqCNN outperforms bow-CNN on sentiment classification, vice versa on topic classification, and both\n1 CNN implemented for image would not handle sparse data efficiently, and without efficient handling of sparse data, convolution over high-dimensional one-hot vectors would be computationally infeasible.\noutperform the conventional bag-of-n-gram vectorbased methods, as well as previous CNN models for text, which are more complex and more expensive to train. In particular, to our knowledge, this is the first work that has successfully used word order to significantly improve topic classification performance. Through empirical analysis, we will show that CNN can make more effective use of high-order n-grams than the conventional methods."

      "text" : "CNN is a feed-forward neural network with convolution layers interleaved with pooling layers, as illustrated in Figure 1, where the top layer performs classification using the features generated by the layers below. A convolution layer consists of several computation units, each of which takes as input a region vector that represents a small region of the input image and applies a non-linear function to it. Typically, the region vector is a concatenation of pixels in the region, which would be, for example, 75-dimensional if the region is 5×5 and the number of channels is three (red, green, and blue). Concep-\ntually, computation units are placed over the input image so that the entire image is collectively covered, as illustrated in Figure 2. The region stride (distance between the region centers) is often set to a small value such as 1 so that regions overlap with each other, though the stride in Figure 2 is set larger than the region size for illustration.\nA distinguishing feature of convolution layers is weight sharing. Given input x, a unit associated with the `-th region computes σ(W · r`(x) + b), where r`(x) is a region vector representing the region of x at location `, and σ is a predefined component-wise non-linear activation function, (e.g., applying σ(x) = max(x, 0) to each vector component). The matrix of weights W and the vector of biases b are learned through training, and they are shared by the computation units in the same layer. This weight sharing enables learning useful features irrespective of their location, while preserving the location where the useful features appeared.\nWe regard the output of a convolution layer as an ‘image’ so that the output of each computation unit is considered to be a ‘pixel’ of m channels where m is the number of weight vectors (i.e., the number of rows of W) or the number of neurons. In other words, a convolution layer converts image regions to m-dim vectors, and the locations of the regions are inherited through this conversion.\nThe output image of the convolution layer is passed to a pooling layer, which essentially shrinks the image by merging neighboring pixels, so that higher layers can deal with more abstract/global information. A pooling layer consists of pooling units, each of which is associated with a small region of the image. Commonly-used merging methods are average-pooling and max-pooling, which respectively compute the channel-wise average/maximum of each region."

Essentially, the expressiveness of bow-convolution (which loses word order only within small regions) is somewhere between seqconvolution and bow vectors."

      "heading" : "2.2.3 Pooling for text",
      "text" : "Whereas the size of images is fixed in image applications, documents are naturally variable-sized, and therefore, with a fixed stride, the output of a convolution layer is also variable-sized as shown in Figure 3. Given the variable-sized output of the convolution layer, standard pooling for image (which uses a fixed pooling region size and a fixed stride) would produce variable-sized output, which can be passed to another convolution layer. To produce fixed-sized output, which is required by the fully-connected top layer3, we fix the number of pooling units and dynamically determine the pooling region size on each data point so that the entire data is covered without overlapping.\nIn the previous CNN work on text, pooling is typically max-pooling over the entire data (i.e., one pooling unit associated with the whole text). The dynamic k-max pooling of (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) for sentence modeling extends it to take the k largest values where k is a function of the sentence length,\n3 In this work, the top layer is fully-connected (i.e., each neuron responds to the entire data) as in CNN for image. Alternatively, the top layer could be convolutional so that it can receive variable-sized input, but such CNN would be more complex.\nbut it is again over the entire data, and the operation is limited to max-pooling. Our pooling differs in that it is a natural extension of standard pooling for image, in which not only max-pooling but other types can be applied. With multiple pooling units associated with different regions, the top layer can receive locational information (e.g., if there are two pooling units, the features from the first half and last half of a document are distinguished). This turned out to be useful (along with average-pooling) on topic classification, as shown later.\n2.3 CNN vs. bag-of-n-grams\nTraditional methods represent each document entirely with one bag-of-n-gram vector and then apply a classifier model such as SVM. However, highorder n-grams are susceptible to the data sparsity problem, and to counteract it, it is necessary to include not only high-order n-grams but also lowerorder n-grams in the vocabulary set; otherwise, performance would be rather degraded. This implies that the discriminating power of high-order n-grams, which is obvious to humans, cannot be fully exploited by the conventional methods based on bag-of-n-gram vectors.\nBy contrast, CNN for text introduced above is more robust in this regard. This is because instead of learning how to weight n-grams, it learns how to weight individual words in the sequence of a fixed size, in order to produce useful features for the intended task. As a result, e.g., a neuron trained to assign a large value to “I love” (and a small value to “I hate”) is likely to assign a large value to “we love” (and a small value to “we hate”) as well, even though “we love” was never seen during training. We will confirm this point empirically in Section 3.5."

      "text" : "CNN To experiment with CNN, we fixed the activation function to rectifier σ(x) = max(x, 0) and minimized square loss with L2 regularization by stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our experiments focused on network architectures with one pair of convolution and pooling layers. However, note that it is possible to have more than one convolutionpooling layer and/or to have fully-connected hidden layers above the convolution-pooling layer. We tested several region sizes, pooling types, and the numbers of pooling units. Out-of-vocabulary words (e.g., stopwords) were represented by a zero vector. On bow-CNN, to speed up computation, we used variable region stride so that a larger stride was taken where repetition4 of the same region vectors can be avoided by doing so. Padding size was fixed to p− 1 where p is the region size.\nBaseline methods For comparison, we tested SVM with the linear kernel and fully-connected neural networks (see e.g., Bishop (1995)) with bag-ofn-gram vectors as input. To experiment with fullyconnected neural nets, as in CNN, we minimized square loss with L2 regularization by SGD, and activation was fixed to rectifier. The bag-of-n-gram vectors were generated by first setting each component to log(x + 1) where x is the word frequency in the document and then scaling to unit vectors, which we found always significantly improved performance over raw frequency. We tested three types of bag-of-n-gram: bow1 with n ∈ {1}, bow2 with n ∈ {1, 2}, and bow3 with n ∈ {1, 2, 3}; that is, bow1 is the traditional bow vectors, and with bow3, each component of the vectors corresponds to either uni-gram, bi-gram, or tri-gram of words. To test the fully-connected neural networks, we tried several configurations in terms of the number of hidden layers and the number of weight vectors in each layer and performed model selection.\nModel selection Importantly, for all the methods, the hyper-parameters such as net configurations and regularization parameters were chosen based on the performance on the development data (held-out por-\n4 For example, if we slide a window of size 3 over “* * foo * *” where “*” is out of vocabulary, a bag of “foo” will be repeated three times with stride fixed to 1.\ntion of the training data), and using the chosen hyper-parameters, the models were re-trained using all the training data.\nImplementation We used SVM-light5 for the SVM experiments.

Both the training and test sets consist of 25K reviews. For preprocessing, we tokenized the text so that emoticons such as “:-)” are treated as tokens and converted all the characters to lower case. We used 30K words (and n-grams for bow2 or bow3) that appeared most frequently in the training set.\nElec: electronics product reviews Elec consists of electronic product reviews. It is part of a large Amazon review dataset (McAuley and Leskovec, 2013). We chose electronics as it seemed to be very different from movies. Following the generation of IMDB (Maas et al., 2011), we chose the training set and the test set so that one half of each set consists of positive reviews and the other half is negative, regarding rating 1 and 2 as positive and 4 and 5 as negative, and that the reviewed products are disjoint between the training set and test set.

      "text" : "Table 2 shows the error rates of CNN in comparison with the baseline methods on all three datasets. Both types of CNN outperform the baseline methods on all the datasets, and seq-CNN outperforms bowCNN on sentiment classification whereas bow-CNN outperforms seq-CNN on topic classification.\nOn sentiment classification (IMDB and Elec), the configuration chosen by model selection (using the development set) was: region size 3, stride 1, 1000 weight vectors, and max-pooling with one pooling unit, for both types of CNN. Note that with a small region size and max-pooling, if a review contains a short phrase that conveys strong sentiment (e.g., “A great movie!”), the review could receive a high score irrespective of the rest of the review. It is sensible that this type of configuration is effective on senti-\nment classification. By contrast, on topic categorization (RCV1), the configuration chosen for bow-CNN by model selection was: region size 20, variable-stride≥2, averagepooling with 10 pooling units, and 1000 weight vectors, which is very different from sentiment classification. This is presumably because on topic classification, a larger context would be more predictive than short fragments (→ larger region size), the entire document matters (→ the effectiveness of average-pooling), and the location of predictive text also matters (→ multiple pooling units). The last point may be because news documents tend to have crucial sentences at the beginning. On this task, bow-CNN outperforms seq-CNN, which indicates that in this setting the merit of having fewer parameters is larger than the benefit of keeping word order in each region.\nComparing the baseline methods with each other, on sentiment classification, error rates were significantly reduced by addition of bi-grams but further adding tri-grams did not improve performance much. On topic categorization, bi-grams only slightly improved accuracy. These are consistent with the previous studies.\nComparison with state-of-the-art results The previous best supervised single-classifier result6 on IMDB is 10.77 achieved by word representation Restricted Boltzmann Machine (WRRBM) combined with bow vectors (Dahl et al., 2012), as shown in\n6 We exclude semi-supervised learning results (Le and Mikolov, 2014) and classifier combination results (Wang and Manning, 2012) as they are not directly comparable with our results.\nTable 3. Our CNN results outperform WRRBM by a relatively large margin.\nWe tested bow-CNN on the multi-label topic categorization task on RCV1 to compare with LYRL04. We used the same thresholding strategy as LYRL04. As shown in Table 4, bow-CNN outperforms LYRL04’s best results even though our data preprocessing is much simpler (no stemming and no tf-idf weighting).\nPrevious CNN We focus on the sentence classification studies due to its relation to text categorization. Kim (2014) studied fine-tuning of pretrained word vectors to produce input to one-layer CNN with one-unit max-pooling. He reported that performance was poor when word vectors were trained as part of CNN training (i.e., no additional method/corpus). On our tasks, this type of model also underperformed the baseline while training was 3–5 times slower (using our code7) than our models. As mentioned earlier, the word vector learning layer in this setting can be viewed as a special case of convolution layer with region size one, and region size one is apparently not suitable for these tasks.\nKalchbrenner et al. (2014) proposed complex modifications of CNN for sentence modeling. Notably, given word vectors ∈ Rd, their convolution with m feature maps produces for each region a matrix ∈ Rd×m (instead of a vector ∈ Rm as in standard CNN). Using the provided code, we found that their model is too resource-demanding for our tasks. On IMDB and Elec8 the best error rates we obtained by training with various configurations that fit in memory for 24 hours each on GPU (cf. Fig 5) were 10.13 and 9.37, respectively, which are only as good as SVM bow2. Since excellent performances were reported on short sentence classification, we presume that their model is optimized for short sentences, but not for text categorization in general.\nThus, on text categorization, the CNN models we propose have an advantage of higher accuracy, simplicity, and faster training.\n7 K14’s code did not scale to our tasks. 8 We could not train adequate models on RCV1 on either\nTesla K20 or M2070 due to memory shortage."

      "text" : "In this section we explain the effectiveness of CNN through looking into what it learns from training.\nFirst, for comparison, we show the n-grams that SVM with bow3 found to be the most predictive; i.e., the following n-grams were assigned the 10 largest weights by SVM on Elec (#train=25K), for the negative and positive class, respectively:\n• useless, poor, returned, worse, return, not worth, disappointing, horrible, terrible, disappointed • excellent, great, amazing, perfect, awesome, love,\nno problems, easy, perfectly, my only\nNote that, even though SVM was also given bi- and tri-grams, the top 10 features chosen by SVM are mostly uni-grams; furthermore, the top 100 features (50 for each class) include 26 bi-grams but only four tri-grams. This means that, with the given size of training data, SVM still heavily counts on unigrams, which could be ambiguous, and cannot fully take advantage of higher-order n-grams.\nIn Table 5, we show some of text regions learned by seq-CNN to be predictive on Elec. The net configuration is the one from Table 2, which has 1000 neurons (weight vectors) in the convolution layer. Recall that the output/activation of the 1000 neurons (after pooling) serve as features in the top layer, and the top layer assigns weights to the features. In the table, Ni/Pi indicates the neuron whose output received the i-th highest weight in the top layer for the negative/positive class, respectively. The table shows the text regions that appear in the training set and highly activate the corresponding neurons. Note that, e.g., “is so bad” cannot be shorter for detection of the negative sentiment since “so bad” could be a part of “not so bad”; thus, tri-gram is indeed helpful for accurate prediction.\nAs is mentioned in Section 2.3, the methods that rely on bag of high-order n-grams tend to suffer from data sparsity. This is because with conventional methods, only the n-grams that appear in the training data can participate in prediction, and the vocabulary overlap between training data and test data rapidly decreases as n increases. By contrast, one strength of CNN is that n-grams (or text regions\nof size n) can contribute to accurate prediction even if they did not appear in the training data, as long as (some of) their constituent words did. This is because vector representation of each text region is based on their constituent words (see Section 2.2.1).\nTo see this point, in Table 6 we show the text regions from the test set, which did not appear in the training data, either entirely or partially as bi-grams, and yet highly activate heavily-weighted (predictive) neurons thus contributing to the prediction. There are many more of these, and we only show a small part of them that fit certain patterns. One noticeable pattern is (be-verb, adverb, sentiment adjective) such as “am entirely satisfied” and “’m overall impressed”. These adjectives alone could be ambiguous as they may be negated. To know that the writer is indeed “satisfied”, we need to see the sequence “am satisfied”, but the insertion of adverb such as “entirely” is very common. “best X ever’ is another pattern that a discriminating pair of words are not adjacent to each other. These patterns require trigrams for disambiguation, and seq-CNN successfully makes use of them even though the exact tri-\ngrams were not seen during training, as a result of learning, e.g., “am X satisfied” with non-negative X (e.g., “am very satisfied”, “am so satisfied”) to be predictive of the positive class through training. That is, CNN can effectively use word order even when bag-of-n-gram-based approaches fail."

To benefit from word order on text categorization, we take a different approach, which employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1986). CNN is a neural network that can make use of the internal structure of data such as the 2D structure of image data through convolution layers, where each computation unit responds to a small region of input data (e.g., a small square of a large image). We apply CNN to text categorization to make use of the 1D structure (word order) of document data so that each unit in the convolution layer responds to a small region of a document (a sequence of words). CNN has been very successful on image classification; see e.g., the winning solutions of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler and Fergus, 2013; Szegedy et al., 2014; Russakovsky et al., 2014).

We directly apply CNN to high-dimensional text data, instead of lowdimensional word vectors as is often done. Two types of CNN are studied: a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, and a simple but new variation which employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, as well as previous CNN models for text, which are more complex and expensive to train.",
