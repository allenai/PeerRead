      "text" : "Relation classification is an important Natural Language Processing (NLP) task which is normally used as an intermediate step in many complex NLP applications such as question-answering and automatic knowledge base construction. Since the last decade there has been increasing interest in applying machine learning approaches to this task (Zhang, 2004; Qian et al., 2009; Rink and Harabagiu, 2010). One reason is the availability of benchmark datasets such as the SemEval-2010\ntask 8 dataset (Hendrickx et al., 2010), which encodes the task of classifying the relationship between two nominals marked in a sentence. The following sentence contains an example of the Component-Whole relation between the nominals “introduction” and “book”.\nThe [introduction]e1 in the [book]e2 is a\nsummary of what is in the text.\nSome recent work on relation classification has focused on the use of deep neural networks with the aim of reducing the number of handcrafted features (Socher et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014). However, in order to achieve state-ofthe-art results these approaches still use some features derived from lexical resources such as WordNet or NLP tools such as dependency parsers and named entity recognizers (NER).\nIn this work, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN), which we name Classification by Ranking CNN (CR-CNN), to tackle the relation classification task. The proposed network learns a distributed vector representation for each relation class. Given an input text segment, the network uses a convolutional layer to produce a distributed vector representation of the text and compares it to the class representations in order to produce a score for each class. We propose a new pairwise ranking loss function that makes it easy to reduce the impact of artificial classes. We perform an extensive number of experiments using the the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset. Using CRCNN, and without the need for any costly handcrafted feature, we outperform the state-of-the-art for this dataset. Our experimental results are evidence that: (1) CR-CNN is more effective than CNN followed by a softmax classifier; (2) omitting the representation of the artificial class Other improves both precision and recall; and (3) using only word embeddings as input features is enough to achieve state-of-the-art results if we consider only the text between the two target nominals. ar X iv :1 50 4. 06 58 0v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 M\nay 2\n01 5\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details the proposed neural network. In Section 3, we present details about the setup of experimental evaluation, and then describe the results in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss previous work in deep neural networks for relation classification and for other NLP tasks. Section 6 presents our conclusions."

For each class c ∈ C, the network learns a distributed vector representation which is encoded as a column in the class embedding matrix W classes. As detailed in Figure 1, the only input for the network is the tokenized text string of the sentence. In the first step, CR-CNN transforms words into realvalued feature vectors. Next, a convolutional layer is used to construct a distributed vector representations of the sentence, rx. Finally, CR-CNN computes a score for each relation class c ∈ C by performing a dot product between rᵀx and W classes."

      "text" : "In the task of relation classification, information that is needed to determine the class of a relation\nbetween two target nouns normally comes from words which are close to the target nouns. Zeng et al. (2014) propose the use of word position embeddings (position features) which help the CNN by keeping track of how close words are to the target nouns. These features are similar to the position features proposed by Collobert et al. (2011) for the Semantic Role Labeling task.\nIn this work we also experiment with the word position embeddings (WPE) proposed by Zeng et al. (2014). The WPE is derived from the relative distances of the current word to the target noun1 and noun2. For instance, in the sentence shown in Figure 1, the relative distances of left to car and plant are -1 and 2, respectively. As in (Collobert et al., 2011), each relative distance is mapped to a vector of dimension dwpe, which is initialized with random numbers. dwpe is a hyperparameter of the network. Given the vectorswp1 andwp2 for the word w with respect to the targets noun1 and noun2, the position embedding of w is given by\nthe concatenation of these two vectors, wpew = [wp1, wp2].\nIn the experiments where word position embeddings are used, the word embedding and the word position embedding of each word are concatenated to form the input for the convolutional layer, embx = {[rw1 , wpew1 ], [rw2 , wpew2 ], ..., [rwN , wpewN ]}."

      "heading" : "2.3 Sentence Representation",
      "text" : "The next step in the NN consists in creating the distributed vector representation rx for the input sentence x. The main challenges in this step are the sentence size variability and the fact that important information can appear at any position in the sentence. In recent work, convolutional approaches have been used to tackle these issues when creating representations for text segments of different sizes (Zeng et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2014; dos Santos and Gatti, 2014) and characterlevel representations of words of different sizes (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014). Here, we use a convolutional layer to compute distributed vector representations of the sentence. The convolutional layer first produces local features around each word in the sentence. Then, it combines these local features using a max operation to create a fixed-sized vector for the input sentence.\nGiven a sentence x, the convolutional layer applies a matrix-vector operation to each window of size k of successive windows in embx = {rw1 , rw2 , ..., rwN }. Let us define the vector zn ∈ Rdwk as the concatenation of a sequence of k word embeddings, centralized in the n-th word:\nzn = (r wn−(k−1)/2 , ..., rwn+(k−1)/2)ᵀ\nIn order to overcome the issue of referencing words with indices outside of the sentence boundaries, we augment the sentence with a special padding token replicated k − 1 2\ntimes at the beginning and the end.\nThe convolutional layer computes the j-th element of the vector rx ∈ Rd c as follows:\n[rx]j = max 1<n<N\n[ f ( W 1zn + b 1 )] j\nwhere W 1 ∈ Rdc×dwk is the weight matrix of the convolutional layer and f is the hyperbolic tangent function. The same matrix is used to extract local features around each word window of the given\nsentence. The fixed-sized distributed vector representation for the sentence is obtained by using the max over all word windows. Matrix W 1 and vector b1 are parameters to be learned. The number of convolutional units dc, and the size of the word context window k are hyperparameters to be chosen by the user. It is important to note that dc corresponds to the size of the sentence representation."

      "heading" : "2.5 Training Procedure",
      "text" : "Our network is trained by minimizing a pairwise ranking loss function over the training set D. The input for each training round is a sentence x and two different class labels y+ ∈ C and c− ∈ C, where y+ is a correct class label for x and c− is not. Let sθ(x)y+ and sθ(x)c− be respectively the scores for class labels y+ and c− generated by the network with parameter set θ. We propose a new logistic loss function over these scores in order to train CR-CNN:\nL = log(1 + exp(γ(m+ − sθ(x)y+))\n+ log(1 + exp(γ(m− + sθ(x)c−)) (1)\nwhere m+ and m− are margins and γ is a scaling factor that magnifies the difference between the score and the margin and helps to penalize more on the prediction errors. The first term in the right side of Equation 1 decreases as the score sθ(x)y+ increases. The second term in the right\nside decreases as the score sθ(x)c− decreases. Training CR-CNN by minimizing the loss function in Equation 1 has the effect of training to give scores greater than m+ for the correct class and (negative) scores smaller than −m− for incorrect classes. In our experiments we set γ to 2, m+ to 2.5 and m− to 0.5. We use L2 regularization by adding the term β‖θ‖2 to Equation 1. In our experiments we set β to 0.001. We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss function with respect to θ.\nLike some other ranking approaches that only update two classes/examples at every training round (Weston et al., 2011; Gao et al., 2014), we can efficiently train the network for tasks which have a very large number of classes. This is an advantage over softmax classifiers.\nOn the other hand, sampling informative negative classes/examples can have a significant impact in the effectiveness of the learned model. In the case of our loss function, more informative negative classes are the ones with a score larger than −m−. The number of classes in the relation classification dataset that we use in our experiments is small. Therefore, in our experiments, given a sentence x with class label y+, the incorrect class c− that we choose to perform a SGD step is the one with the highest score among all incorrect classes c− = argmax\nc ∈ C; c 6=y+ sθ(x)c.\nFor tasks where the number of classes is large, we can fix a number of negative classes to be considered at each example and select the one with the largest score to perform a gradient step. This approach is similar to the one used by Weston et al. (2014) to select negative examples.\nWe use the backpropagation algorithm to compute gradients of the network. In our experiments, we implement the CR-CNN architecture and the backpropagation algorithm using Theano (Bergstra et al., 2010).\n2.6 Special Treatment of Artificial Classes\nIn this work, we consider a class as artificial if it is used to group items that do not belong to any of the actual classes. An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task. In this task, the artificial class Other is used to indicate that the relation between two nominals does not belong to any of the nine relation classes of interest. Therefore, the class Other is very noisy since it groups many different types\nof relations that may not have much in common. An important characteristic of CR-CNN is that it makes it easy to reduce the effect of artificial classes by omitting their embeddings. If the embedding of a class label c is omitted, it means that the embedding matrix W classes does not contain a column vector for c. One of the main benefits from this strategy is that the learning process focuses on the “natural” classes only. Since the embedding of the artificial class is omitted, it will not influence the prediction step, i.e., CR-CNN does not produce a score for the artificial class.\nIn our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task, when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other, the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero. During prediction time, a relation is classified as Other only if all actual classes have negative scores. Otherwise, it is classified with the class which has the largest score."

The nine relations are Cause-Effect, Component-Whole, Content-Container, EntityDestination, Entity-Origin, Instrument-Agency, Member-Collection, Message-Topic and ProductProducer. Each example contains a sentence marked with two nominals e1 and e2, and the task consists of predicting the relation between the two nominals taking into consideration the directionality. That means that the relation CauseEffect(e1,e2) is different from the relation CauseEffect(e2,e1), as shown in the examples below.

      "text" : "In the experiments discussed in this section we assess the impact of using word position embeddings (WPE) and also propose a simpler alternative approach that is almost as effective as WPEs. The main idea behind the use of WPEs in relation classification task is to give some hint to the convolutional layer of how close a word is to the target nouns, based on the assumption that closer words have more impact than distant words.\nHere we hypothesize that most of the information needed to classify the relation appear between the two target nouns. Based on this hypothesis, we perform an experiment where the input for the convolutional layer consists of the word embeddings of the word sequence {we1 − 1, ..., we2 +1} where e1 and e2 correspond to the positions of the first and the second target nouns, respectively.\nIn Table 2 we compare the results of different CR-CNN configurations. The first column indicates whether the full sentence was used (Yes) or whether the text span between the target nouns was used (No). The second column informs if the WPEs were used or not. It is clear that the use of WPEs is essential when the full sentence is used, since F1 jumps from 74.3 to 84.1. This effect of WPEs is reported by (Zeng et al., 2014). On the other hand, when using only the text span between the target nouns, the impact of WPE is much smaller. With this strategy, we achieve a F1 of 82.8 using only word embeddings as input, which is a result as good as the previous state-of-the-art F1 of 83.0 reported in (Yu et al., 2014) for the SemEval2010 Task 8 dataset. This experimental result also suggests that, in this task, the CNN works better for short texts.\nAll experiments reported in the next sections use CR-CNN with full sentence and WPEs.\n4.2 Impact of Omitting the Embedding of the artificial class Other\nIn this experiment we assess the impact of omitting the embedding of the class Other. As we mentioned above, this class is very noisy since it groups many different infrequent relation types. Its embedding is difficult to define and therefore brings noise into the classification process of the natural classes. In Table 3 we present the results comparing the use and omission of embedding for the class Other. The two first lines of results present the official F1, which does not take into account the results for the class Other. We can see that by omitting the embedding of the class Other both precision and recall for the other classes improve, which results in an increase of 1.4 in the F1. These results suggest that the strategy we use in CR-CNN to avoid the noise of artificial classes is effective.\nIn the two last lines of Table 3 we present the results for the class Other. We can note that while the recall for the cases classified as Other remains 48.7, the precision significantly decreases from 60.1 to 52.0 when the embedding of the class Other is not used. That means that more cases from natural classes (all) are now been classified as Other. However, as both the precision and the recall of the natural classes increase, the cases that are now classified as Other must be cases that are also wrongly classified when the embedding of the class Other is used."

We tune the parameters of CNN+Softmax by using a 4-fold cross-validation with the training set. Compared to the hyperparameter values for CR-CNN presented in Table 1, the only difference for CNN+Softmax is the number of convolutional units dc, which is set to 400.\nIn Table 4 we compare the results of CRCNN and CNN+Softmax. CR-CNN outperforms CNN+Softmax in both precision and recall, and improves the F1 by 1.6. The third line in Table 4 shows the result reported by Zeng et al. (2014) when only word embeddings and WPEs are used as input to the network (similar to our CNN+Softmax). We believe that the word embeddings employed by them is the main reason their result is much worse than that of CNN+Softmax.

It obtains an F1 of 82.2, which was the best result at SemEval-2010 Task 8. Socher et al. (2012) present results for a recursive neural network (RNN) that employs a matrix-vector representation to every node in a parse tree in order to compose the distributed vector representation for the complete sentence. Their method is named the matrix-vector recursive neural network (MVRNN) and achieves a F1 of 82.4 when POS, NER and WordNet features are used. In (Zeng et al., 2014), the authors present results for a CNN+Softmax classifier which employs lexical and sentencelevel features. Their classifier achieves a F1 of 82.7 when adding a handcrafted feature based on the WordNet. Yu et al. (2014) present the Factor-\nbased Compositional Embedding Model (FCM), which achieves a F1 of 83.0 by deriving sentencelevel and substructure embeddings from word embeddings utilizing dependency trees and named entities.\nAs we can see in the last line of Table 5, CRCNN using the full sentence, word embeddings and WPEs outperforms all previous reported results and reaches a new state-of-the-art F1 of 84.1. This is a remarkable result since we do not use any complicated features that depend on external lexical resources such as WordNet and NLP tools such as named entity recognizers (NERs) and dependency parsers.\nWe can see in Table 5 that CR-CNN1 also achieves the best result among the systems that use word embeddings as the only input features.

Remember that in CR-CNN, given a sentence x the score for the class c is computed by sθ(x)c = rᵀx[W classes]c. In order to compute the most representative trigram of a sentence x, we trace back each position in rx to find the trigram responsible for it. For each trigram t, we compute its particular contribution for the score by summing the terms in score that use positions in rx that trace back to t. The most representative trigram in x is the one with the largest contribution to the improvement of the score. In order to create the results presented in Table 6, we rank the trigrams which were selected as the most representative of any sentence in decreasing order of contribution value. If a trigram appears as the largest contributor for more than one sentence, its contribuition value becomes the sum of its contribution for each sentence.\nWe can see in Table 6 that for most classes, the trigrams that contributed the most to increase the score are indeed very informative regarding the relation type. As expected, different trigrams play an important role depending on the direction of the relation. For instance, the most informative tri-\n1This is the result using only the text span between the target nouns.\ngram for Entity-Origin(e1,e2) is “away from the”, while reverse direction of the relation, EntityOrigin(e2,e1) or Origin-Entity, has “the source of” as the most informative trigram.

Most of them treat it as a multiclass classification problem and apply a variety of machine learning techniques to the task in order to achieve a high accuracy.\nRecently, deep learning (Bengio, 2009) has become an attractive area for multiple applications, including computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Among the different deep learning strategies, convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to different NLP task such as part-of-speech tagging (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014), sentiment analysis (Kim, 2014; dos Santos and Gatti, 2014), question classification (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014), semantic role labeling (Collobert et al., 2011), hashtag prediction (Weston et al., 2014), sentence completion and response matching (Hu et al., 2014).\nSome recent work on deep learning for relation classification include Socher et al. (2012), Zeng et al. (2014) and Yu et al. (2014). In (Socher et al., 2012), the authors tackle relation classification using a recursive neural network (RNN) that assigns a matrix-vector representation to every node in a parse tree. The representation for the complete sentence is computed bottom-up by recursively combining the words according to the syntactic structure of the parse tree Their method is named the matrix-vector recursive neural network (MVRNN).\nZeng et al. (2014) propose an approach for relation classification where sentence-level features are learned through a CNN, which has word embedding and position features as its input. In parallel, lexical features are extracted according to given nouns. Then sentence-level and lexical features are concatenated into a single vector and fed into a softmax classifier for prediction. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.\nYu et al. (2014) propose a Factor-based Com-\npositional Embedding Model (FCM) by deriving sentence-level and substructure embeddings from word embeddings, utilizing dependency trees and named entities. It achieves slightly higher accuracy on the same dataset than (Zeng et al., 2014), but only when syntactic information is used.\nThere are two main differences between the approach proposed in this paper and the ones proposed in (Socher et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2014): (1) CR-CNN uses a pair-wise ranking method, while other approaches apply multiclass classification by using the softmax function on the top of the CNN/RNN; and (2) CR-CNN employs an effective method to deal with artificial classes by omitting their embeddings, while other approaches treat all classes equally."

In this work we tackle the relation classification task using a convolutional neural network that performs classification by ranking (CR-CNN). We propose a new pairwise ranking loss function that makes it easy to reduce the impact of artificial classes. We perform experiments using the the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset, which is designed for the task of classifying the relationship between two nominals marked in a sentence. Using CRCNN, we outperform the state-of-the-art for this dataset and achieve a F1 of 84.1 without using any costly handcrafted features. Additionally, our experimental results show that: (1) our approach is more effective than CNN followed by a softmax classifier; (2) omitting the representation of the artificial class Other improves both precision and recall; and (3) using only word embeddings as input features is enough to achieve state-of-the-art results if we consider only the text between the two target nominals.",
