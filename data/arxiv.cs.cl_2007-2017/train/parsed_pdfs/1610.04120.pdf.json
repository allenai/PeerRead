      "text" : "In most existing work on Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), semantic decoding is usually seen as a sequence tagging problem with models trained and tested on datasets with word-level annotations (Tür et al., 2013; Mesnil et al., 2015; Yao et al., 2013; Sarikaya et al., 2011; Deoras and Sarikaya, 2013; Sarikaya et al., 2014). Spoken language understanding from unaligned data, in which utterances are annotated with an abstract semantics, faces the additional challenge of not knowing which specific words are relevant for extracting the semantics. This problem was tackled in (Zhou and He, 2011), by using conditional random fields (CRFs) driven by finely-tuned hand-crafted features. Other discriminative approaches that deal with unaligned data use some form of delexicalisation or mapping of the input to known ontological concepts (Henderson et al., 2012; Henderson et al., 2014a). The main disadvantage of delexicalisation is the difficulty in scaling it, not only to larger and more complex dialogue domains but also to handle the many forms of language variation.\nWe propose in this paper a semantic decoder that learns from unaligned data (Figure 1) and that exploits rich semantic distributed word representations instead of delexicalisation. The semantic decoder predicts the dialogue act and the set of slot-value pairs from a set of n-best hypotheses returned by an automatic speech recognition (ASR). The prediction is made in two steps. First, a deep learning architecture is used for the joint prediction of dialogue acts and the presence or absence of slots. Second, the same architecture is reused for predicting the values of the slots that were detected by the first jointclassifier. The deep architecture combines sentence and context representations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) (Collobert et al., 2011) is used to generate the sentence representation, while a longshort term memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is used to generate the context representation. A non-linear function then combines the top layers of these neural networks and distinct softmax layers are used to predict the dialogue act and slots in the first joint model. In the second model, a single softmax predicts the possible values for each slot.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

We show that these models outperform previous proposed models, without using manually designed features and without any preprocessing of the input (e.g., stop words filtering, delexicalisation). They do this by exploiting distributed word representations and we claim that this allows semantic decoders to be built that can easily scale to larger and more complex dialogue domains.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We first present related work in Section 2 and then we describe our architecture in Section 3. We describe the experimental setup in 4 and the evaluation results are introduced in Section 5. Finally, we present conclusions and future work in Section 6."

      "text" : "Sequence tagging discriminative models such as CRFs and sequence neural networks have been widely explored for spoken language understanding. For instance, Recurrent Neural Networks have been proposed in (Yao et al., 2013; Mesnil et al., 2015) and generative Deep Neural Networks consisting of a composition of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) have been studied by (Sarikaya et al., 2011; Deoras and Sarikaya, 2013; Sarikaya et al., 2014). A combination of neural networks and triangular CRFs is presented in (Celikyilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010), in which a convolutional neural network is used for extracting the input features of a triangular CRF in order to perform joint intent detection and slot filling. All these models use word-level semantic annotations. However, providing these word-level semantic annotations is costly since it requires specialised annotators. (Zhou and He, 2011) has proposed learning CRFs from unaligned data, however they use manually tuned lexical or syntactic features. In this work we avoid the need for word-level annotation by exploiting distributed word embeddings and using deep learning for feature representation.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been used previously for sentiment analysis (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) and in this work we explore a similar CNN to the one presented by Kim (2014) for generating a sentence representation. However unlike Kim (2014), the input in not a single well formed sentence but a set of ill-formed ASR hypotheses. Additionally, the softmax layer used for binary classification (i.e., positive or negative sentiment) is replaced by a softmax layer for multiclass dialogue act prediction and a further softmax layer is added for each distinct slot in the domain. (Chen and He, 2015) proposed a CNN for generating intent embeddings in SLU, which uses tri-letter input vectors. Instead, in this paper the models are initialised with GloVe word embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014). These GloVe embeddings were trained in an unsupervised fashion on a large amount of data to model the contextual similarity and correlation between words. Chen and He’s model aims to learn the embeddings for utterances and intents such that utterances with similar intents are close to each other in the continuous space. Although we share the same spirit, we use sentence embeddings not only for intent\ncreativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n(or dialogue act) recognition but also for slot-filling within a dialogue system and we combine them with embeddings for dialogue context.\nApproaches for adaptive SLU have been proposed in (Ferreira et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2014), however they focused more on domain adaptation on top of an existing SLU component. Moreover, they use classical discriminative models for SLU such as CRFs and SVMs that require manually designed features. In contrast, the focus of this paper is to exploit deep learning models for SLU, which learn feature representations automatically.\nRecently, some researchers have focused on mapping word level hypotheses directly to beliefs without using an explicit semantic decoder step (Henderson et al., 2014a; Mrkšić et al., 2015). These systems track the user’s goal through the course of the dialogue by maintaining a distribution over slot-value pairs. Such systems are interesting, but it is not clear that they can be scaled to very large domains due to the constraint of delexicalisation. Furthermore, they still require an explicit semantic decoding layer for domain identification and general Topic Management."

      "text" : "We split the task of semantic decoding into two steps: (i) training a joint model for predicting the dialogue act and presence or absence of slots and (ii) predicting the values for the most probable slots detected in (i). As shown in Figure 2, we use the same deep learning architecture in both steps for combining sentence and context representations to generate the final hidden unit that feeds one or many softmax layers. In the first step, as shown in the Figure, there are distinct softmax layers for the joint optimisation of the dialogue act and each possible slot. In the second step there is a single softmax layer that predicts the value of each specific slot. In the following we explain this architecture in more detail."

Let xi be a k−dimensional word embedding for the i-th word in a hypothesis. A hypothesis of length m is represented as: x1:m = x1 ⊕ x2 ⊕ ... ⊕ xm where ⊕\nis the concatenation operator.

      "text" : "An LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is used for tracking the context implied by previous dialogue system actions. The top layer of this LSTM network then provides the context representation for decoding the current input utterance.\nAn LSTM is a sequence model that utilises a memory cell capable of preserving states over long periods of time. This cell is recurrently connected to itself and it has three multiplication units, an input gate, a forget gate and an output gate. These gating vectors are in [0,1]. The cell makes selective decisions about what information is preserved, and when to allow access to units, via gates that open and close. The LSTM transition equations are as follows:\nit = σ(W (i) · xt +U(i) · ht−1 + b(i)),\nft = σ(W (f) · xt +U(f) · ht−1 + b(f)), ot = σ(W (o) · xt +U(o) · ht−1 + b(o)),\nut = tanh(W (u) · xt +U(u) · ht−1 + b(u)), ct = it ⊙ ut + ft ⊙\nct−1, ht = ot ⊙ tanh(ct)\n(4)\nwhere ht is the hidden unit at time step t, xt is the input at the current time step, b is a bias, σ is the logistic sigmoid function and ⊙ denotes elementwise multiplication.\nAs shown in Figure 1, system actions are encoded in the form of a system dialogue act plus one or more slot-value pairs. To track the history of system actions, slots and values are treated as words and the input xt is formed from its corresponding word vectors. The length of the context can vary. We consider\n1The posterior probability of hypothesis j in the N-best list.\nall the system actions previous to the current user utterance, or a window l of the previous system actions. For instance, if we are currently processing the last user input in Figure 1, in which L is the total number of system actions, we can consider all previous system actions (L=4), or the last l system actions, where l < L."

The first straightforward way is to apply a non linear function to their weighted sum:\nĥt = tanh(Ws · st +Wc · ht) (5)\nThe second way is to let the sentence representation be the last input to the LSTM network, then ĥt = ht. For classification a softmax layer is used for each prediction:\nP (Y = k|ĥ,W, b) = e (Wkĥ+bk)∑\nk′ e (Wk′ĥ+bk′)\n(6)\nwhere k is the index of the output neuron representing one class. For dialogue act classification k is one of the possible values: inform, request, offer, ... etc. For the slot prediction k is either 0 for absent or 1 for present. For slot-value prediction k will correspond to one of the possible values for each slot. For instance, for the slot price-range the possible values are cheap, moderate, expensive and dontcare. The result of the prediction is the most probable class:\nŷ = argmaxk(P (Y = k|ĥ,W, b)) (7)\nThe back-propagation optimisation is done by minimising the negative log-likelihood loss function through stochastic gradient descent."

      "heading" : "5 Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "In this section we report the results on DSTC2 and In-car dialogue corpora.\nStep I: Joint classification of dialogue-acts and slots: For this step, the classifiers must predict jointly 14 dialogue acts and 5 slots for the DSTC2 dataset as well as 14 dialogue acts and 7 slots for the In-car dataset. We evaluate both (i) using 10 fold cross-validation on the trainsets and (ii) on the corpora’ testsets.\nTable 1 shows the 10 fold cross-validation results on both corpora. These results suggest that for DTSC2, the context representation is not significantly impacting the prediction. Although, the model with a window of 4 ,CNN+LSTM w4, improves slightly the accuracy and f1-score. On the In-car dataset, however, including the context does help to disambiguate the semantic predictions from illformed hypotheses. This is expected, since this data set has a much higher error rate and hence higher levels of confusion in the ASR output. Although there is no significant difference on the f1-score when using the immediate previous system act (w1) or a longer context, CNN+LSTM w gives a better accuracy and a lower ICE score on this dataset.\nTable 2 shows the results on the test sets. Consequently, when evaluating on the DSTC2 test set, a window of 4 (w4), performs slightly better than other window sizes and better than the simple CNN model. On the In-car testset, a context window of 4 outperforms all the other settings: CNN+LSTM. However, on this test set using the sentence representation as the last input to the LSTM context neural network (section 3.3) improves the f1-score and reduces the ICE error.\nStep II: Prediction of slot value pairs For evaluating Step II, we selected the best model obtained during the 10-fold cross-validation experiments in terms of F1 score. For both corpora, this was the CNN+LSTM w4 configuration. For DSTC2, it was the 4th-fold crossvalidation with Acc = 90.42%,\nF1 = 88.69% and ICE = 0.251. For In-car, it was the 5th-fold crossvalidation with Acc = 93.13%, F1 = 81.49% and ICE = 0.393. We used these models to classify whether a given slot appears in a given hypothesis or not. Then for that slot, we train another CNN+LSTM w4 classifier for predicting its values. In the In-car corpus the slot ”type” has only one possible value ”restaurant”. Similarly, the slot ”task” can only be the value ”find”. For these slots with only one value, we report values using the model of Step I, since it is enough to detect the slot in the utterance.\nGiven that there is no domain specific delexicalisation, the models achieve a good level of performance overall (Table 3). Note that the slot ”food” has 74 possible values in DSTC2 and 25 in In-car. Hence, this slot has much higher cardinality than all the other slots.\nOverall performance A baseline for assessing overall performance is provided by the model presented in (Henderson et al., 2012), in which the vector representation is obtained by summing up the frequency of n-grams extracted from the 10-best hypotheses, weighted by their confidence scores. Here we compare our performance against Henderson’s model with and without context features, namely WNGRAMS+Ctxt and WNGRAMS repectively. Henderson reported his results on the In-car dataset. A similar model, namely SLU1, was evaluated on DSTC2 in (Williams, 2014). Both implementations consist of many binary classifiers for dialogue act and slot-value pairs.\nIn terms of the ICE score, the model CNN+LSTM W4 outperforms all the baselines (Table 4). In terms of the F1 score, the model significantly outperforms the SLU1 and WNGRAMS baselines. However it is slightly worse than WNGRAMS+Ctxt, which has been enhanced with context features on In-car. Remember however, that our model uses only word-embeddings for automatically generating sentence and context representations without having any manually designed features or using explicit application specific semantic dictionaries.\n4”Slot” is used when no value is given for the slot (e.g., ”What kind of food do they serve?”/request(slot=food)). 5”This” is used for annotating elliptical utterances (e.g., ”I dont care”/inform(this=’dontcare’))."

In a slot-filling dialogue, the semantic decoder predicts the dialogue act and a set of slot-value pairs from a set of n-best hypotheses returned by the Automatic Speech Recognition. Most current models for spoken language understanding assume (i) word-aligned semantic annotations as in sequence taggers and (ii) delexicalisation, or a mapping of input words to domain-specific concepts using heuristics that try to capture morphological variation but that do not scale to other domains nor to language variation (e.g., morphology, synonyms, paraphrasing ). In this work the semantic decoder is trained using unaligned semantic annotations and it uses distributed semantic representation learning to overcome the limitations of explicit delexicalisation. The proposed architecture uses a convolutional neural network for the sentence representation and a long-short term memory network for the context representation. Results are presented for the publicly available DSTC2 corpus and an In-car corpus which is similar to DSTC2 but has a significantly higher word error rate (WER).",
