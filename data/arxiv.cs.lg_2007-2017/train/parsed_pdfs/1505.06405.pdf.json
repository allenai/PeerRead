      "text" : " Abstract—This paper addresses an important issue, known as sensor drift that behaves a nonlinear dynamic property in electronic nose (E-nose), from the viewpoint of machine learning. Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing drift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new perspectives for ELM.\nIndex Terms—Drift compensation, electronic nose, extreme learning machine, domain adaptation, transfer learning\nI. INTRODUCTION XTREME learning machine (ELM), proposed for solving a single layer feed-forward network (SLFN) by Huang et al [1, 2], has been proven to be effective and efficient algorithms for pattern classification and regression in different fields. ELM can analytically determine the output weights between the hidden layer and output layer using Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by adopting the square loss of prediction error, which then turns into solving a regularized least square problem efficiently in closed form. The hidden layer output is activated by an infinitely differentiable function with randomly\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (61401048), Hong Kong Scholar Program (XJ2013044) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M550457).\nL.

Zhang is with Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong (e-mail: csdzhang@comp.polyu.edu.hk).\nselected input weights and biases of the hidden layer. Huang [3] rigorously proved that the input weights and hidden layer biases can be randomly assigned if the activation function is infinitely differentiable, and also showed that single SLFN with randomly generated additive or RBF nodes with such activation functions can universally approximate any continuous function on any compact subspace of Euclidean space [4].\nIn recent years, ELM has witnessed a number of improved versions in models, algorithms and real-world applications. ELM shows a comparable or even higher prediction accuracy than that of SVMs which solves a quadratic programming problem. In [3], their differences have been discussed. Some specific examples of improved ELMs have been listed as follows. As the output weights are computed with predefined input weights and biases, a set of non-optimal input weights and hidden biases may exist. Additionally, ELM may require more hidden neurons than conventional learning algorithms in some special applications. Therefore, Zhu et al [5] proposed an evolutionary ELM for more compact networks that speed the response of trained networks. In terms of the imbalanced number of classes, a weighted ELM was proposed for binary/multiclass classification tasks with both balanced and imbalanced data distribution [6]. Due to that the solution of ELM is dense which will require longer time for training in large scale applications, Bai et al [7] proposed a sparse ELM for reducing storage space and testing time. Besides, Li et al [8] also proposed a fast sparse approximation of ELM for sparse classifiers training at a rather low complexity without reducing the generalization performance. For all the versions of ELM mentioned above, supervised learning framework was widely explored in application which limits its ability due to the difficulty in obtaining the labeled data. Therefore, Huang et al [9] proposed a semi-supervised ELM for classification, in which a manifold regularization with graph Laplacian was set, and an unsupervised ELM was also explored for clustering.\nIn the past years, the contributions to ELM theories and applications have been made substantially by researchers from various fields. However, with the rising of big data, the data distribution obtained in different stages with different experimental conditions may change, i.e. from different domains. It is also well know that E-nose data collection and data labeling is tedious and labor ineffective, while the classifiers trained by a small number of labeled data are not robust and therefore lead to weak generalization, especially for large-scale application. Though ELM performs better generalization when a number of labeled data from source\nDomain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machines for Drift Compensation in E-nose Systems\nLei Zhang, Member, IEEE and David Zhang, Fellow, IEEE\nE\ndomain is used in learning, the transferring capability of ELM is reduced with a limited number of labeled training instances from target domains. Domain adaptation methods have been proposed for robust classifiers learning by leveraging a few labeled instances from target domains [10-14] in machine learning community and computer vision [15]. It is worth noting that domain adaptation is different from semi-supervised learning which assumes that the labeled and unlabeled data are from the same domain in classifier training.\nIn this paper, we extend ELMs to handle domain adaptation problems for improving the transferring capability of ELM between multiple domains with very few labeled guide instances in target domain, and overcome the generalization disadvantages of ELM in multi-domains application. Specifically, we address the problem of sensor drift compensation in E-nose by using the proposed cross-domain learning framework. Inspired by ELM and knowledge adaptation, a unified domain adaptation ELM framework is proposed for sensor drift compensation. The merits of this paper include:  To the best of our knowledge, there is no report that couples\ndomain adaptation with ELM framework in machine learning community, while this paper provides several new perspectives for exploring ELM theory.  We integrate a new methodology i.e. domain adaptation ELM in E-nose for sensor drift compensation and gas recognition. The propose DAELM is a unified classifier learning framework with knowledge adaptability and well addressed the problem of drift as well as gas recognition.  One method of DAELM, called source domain adaptation ELM (DAELM-S) which learns a classifier by using a number of labeled data from the source domain, and leveraging a limited number of labeled samples from target domain as regularization, is proposed intuitively.  Another method of DAELM, called target domain adaptation ELM (DAELM-T) is also proposed. DAELM-T learns a classifier using a limited number of labeled instances from target domain, while the remaining numerous unlabeled data are also fully exploited by approximating the prediction of a pre-learned base classifier trained in source domain to that of the learned classifier, into which many existing classifiers can be incorporated as the base classifier.  Both DAELM-S and DAELM-T can be formed into a unified ELM framework, in which two steps including random feature mapping and output weights training are referred and our DAELM holds the merits of ELM. In both methods, the final solution can be analytically determined, and the generalization performance is guaranteed in E-nose application.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, related work in sensor drift compensation and a brief review of ELM are presented. In Section III, the proposed DAELM framework including two specific algorithms: DAELM-S and DAELM-T is presented. In Section IV, we present the experiments on the popular sensor drift data collected by an E-nose for 3 years, and the results of drift compensation and gas\nrecognition. Finally, Section V concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Electronic nose is an intelligent multi-sensor system or artificial olfaction system, which is developed as instrument for gas recognition [18, 19], tea quality assessment [20, 21], medical diagnosis [22], environmental monitor and gas concentration estimation [23, 24], etc. by coupling with pattern recognition and gas sensor array with cross-sensitivity and broad spectrum characteristics. An excellent overview of the E-nose and techniques for processing the sensor responses can be referred to as [32], [33].\nHowever, sensors are often operated over a long period in real-world application and lead to aging that seriously reduces the lifetime of sensors. This is so called sensor drift caused by unknown dynamic process, such as poisoning, aging or environmental variations [34]. Sensor drift has deteriorated the performance of classifiers [25] used for gas recognition of chemosensory systems or E-noses, and plagued the sensory community for many years. Therefore, researchers have to re-train the classifier using a number of new samples in a period regularly for recalibration. However, the tedious work for classifier retraining and acquisition of new labeled samples regularly seems to be impossible for recalibration, due to the complicated gaseous experiments of E-nose and labor cost.\nThe drift problem can be formulated as follows. Suppose , , ⋯ , are gas sensor data sets collected by an E-nose with K batches ranked according to the time intervals, where = , = 1, ⋯ , , denotes a feature vector of the j-th sample in batch i, and Ni is the number of samples in batch i. The sensor drift problem is that the feature distributions of , ⋯ , do not obey the distribution of . As a result, the classifier trained using the labeled data of has degraded performance when tested on , ⋯ , due to the deteriorated generalization ability caused by drift. Generally, the mismatch of distribution between and becomes larger with increasing batch index i (i>1) and aging. From the angle of domain adaptation, in this paper, is called source domain/auxiliary domain (without drift) with labeled data,\n, ⋯ , are referred to as target domain (drifted) in which only a limited number of labeled data is available.\nDrift compensation has been studied for many years. Generally, drift compensation methods can be divided into three categories: component correction methods, adaptive methods, and machine learning methods. Specifically, multivariate component correction, such as CCPCA [35] which attempts to find the drift direction using PCA and remove the drift component is recognized as a popular method in periodic calibration. However, CCPCA assumes that the data from all classes behaves in the same way in the presence of drift that is not always the case. Additionally, evolutionary algorithm which optimizes a multiplicative correction factor for drift compensation [36] was proposed as an adaptive method. However, the generalization performance of the correction factor is limited for on-line use due to the nonlinear dynamic behavior of sensor drift. Classifier ensemble in machine learning was first proposed in [26] for drift compensation,\nwhich has shown improved gas recognition accuracy using the data with long term drift. An overview of the drift compensation is referred to as [25]. Other recent methods to cope with drift can be referred to as [27]-[29].\nThough researchers have paid more attention to sensor drift and aim to find some measures for drift compensation, sensor drift is still a challenging issue in machine olfaction community and sensory field. To our best knowledge, the existing methods are limited in dealing with sensor drift due to their weak generalization to completely new data in presence of drift. Therefore, we aim to enhance the adaptive performance of classifiers to new drifting/drifted data using cross-domain learning with very low complexity. It would be very meaningful and interesting to train a classifier using very few labeled new samples (target domain) without giving up the recognized “useless” old data (source domain), and realize effective and efficient knowledge transfer (i.e. drift compensation) from source domain to multiple target domains."

However, the unlabeled data is neglected which can also improve the performance of classification [17].

For ELM, the algorithm is constructed and implemented in a single domain (source domain), as a result, the generalization performance is degraded in new domains. In the proposed DAELM framework, a limited number of labeled samples and numerous unlabeled data in target domain are exploited without changing the unified ELM framework, and the merits of ELM are inherited. The framework for DAELM might draw some new perspectives of domain adaptation for developing ELM theory. Remark 2: We observe that the DAELM-S has similar structure in model and algorithm with DAELM-T. The essential difference lies in that numerous unlabeled data which may be useful for improving generalization performance are exploited in DAELM-T through a pre-learned base classifier. Specifically,\nDAELM-S learns a classifier using the labeled training data in source domain but draw some new knowledge by leveraging a limited number of labeled samples from target domain, such that the knowledge from target domain can be effectively transferred to source domain for generalization. Whilst DAELM-T attempts to train a classifier using a limited number of labeled data from target domain as “main knowledge” but introduces a regularizer that minimizes the error between outputs of DAELM-T classifier and the base classifier computed on the unlabeled input data."

[26, 30] is exploited and studied in this paper.\nThe sensor drift big dataset was gathered during the period from January 2008 to February 2011 with 36 months in a gas delivery platform. Totally, this dataset contains 13,910 measurements (observations) from an electronic nose system with 16 gas sensors exposed to 6 kinds of pure gaseous substances including acetone, acetaldehyde, ethanol, ethylene, ammonia, and toluene at different concentration levels, individually. For each sensor, 8 features were extracted, and a 128-dimensional feature vector (8 features × 16 sensors) for each observation is formulated as a result. We refer readers to as [26] for specific technical details on how to select the 8 features for each sensor. In total, 10 batches of sensor data that collected in different time intervals are included in the dataset. The details of the dataset are presented in Table I.\nFor visualization of the drift behavior existing in the dataset,\nwe first plot the sensor response before and after drifting. We view the data in batch 1 as non-drift, and select batch 2, batch 7, and batch 10 as drifted data, respectively, and the response is given in Fig. 3. It’s known that sensor drift shows nonlinear behavior in a multi-dimensional sensor array, and it is impossible to intuitively and directly calibrate the sensor response using some linear or nonlinear transformation. Instead, we consider it as a space distribution adaptation using transfer learning and realize the drift compensation in decision level. Therefore, to observe the space distribution variation with drift, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) on the dataset, and project the data into a 2D subspace based on the first two PCs. The projected 2D subspace for all data in each batch is shown in Fig. 4, from which we can observe the significant changes of data space distribution caused by drift over time.\nIt’s worth noting that sensor responses after drift cannot be calibrated directly due to the nonlinear dynamic behavior or chaotic behavior [28] of sensor drift. Therefore, drift compensation in decision level by data distribution adaptation and machine learning is more appealing.\nConsidering that a small number of labeled samples (guide samples) should be first selected from the target domains in the proposed DAELM-S and DAELM-T algorithms, while the labeled target data plays an important role in knowledge adaptation, we therefore adopt a representative labeled sample selection algorithm (SSA) based on the Euclidean distance\n( , ) of a sample pair ( , ) . For detail, the SSA algorithm is summarized as Algorithm 3.\nThe visual SSA algorithm in 2-dimensional coordinate plane for selecting 5 guide samples from each target domain (batch) is shown in Fig. 5 as an example. The patterns marked as “1” denote the first two selected patterns (farthest distance) in Step2. Then, the patterns marked as “2”, “3”, “4” denote the three selected patterns sequentially. The SSA is for the purpose that the labeled samples selected from target domains should be representative and global in the data space, and promise the generalization performance of domain adaptation."

The popular CC-PCA method [35] and classifier ensemble [26] for drift compensation are also reported in Setting 1 and Setting 2. Due to the random selection of input weights between input layer and hidden layer, and bias in hidden layer under ELM framework, in experiments, we run the ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T for 10 times, and the average values are reported.

Both the proposed DAELM-S and DAELM-T significantly outperform all other existing methods including traditional CC-PCAM, SVM and manifold regularization based machine learning methods. In addition, DAELM-T(50) has an obvious improvement than DAELM-T(40) and DAELM-S, which shows that more labeled target data is expected for DAELM-T. While DAELM-S can also perform well comparatively with fewer labeled target data. From the computations, due to that a base classifier is first trained in DAELM-T and more labeled target data need, DAELM-S maybe a better choice in realistic applications.\nFrom the experimental results in experimental Setting 1, the proposed methods outperform all other methods in drift compensation. We then follow the experimental Setting 2, i.e. trained on batch K-1 and tested on batch K, and report the results in Table III. The performance variations of all methods are illustrated in Fig. 7. From Table III and Fig. 7, we have the following observations: 1. Manifold regularization based combined kernel\n(ML-comgfk) achieves an average accuracy of 79.6% and outperforms other SVM based machine learning algorithms and single kernel methods, which demonstrates that manifold learning and combined kernel can improve the classification accuracy, but limited capacity. 2. The classifier ensemble can improve the performance of the dataset with drift noise (an average accuracy of 80.0%). However, many base classifiers should be trained using the source data for ensemble, and it has no domain adaptability when tested on the data from target domains, which has been well referred in the proposed DAELM. 3. The proposed DAELM methods perform much better (91.82%) than all other existing methods for different tasks in recognition tested on drifted data. The robustness of the proposed methods with domain adaptability is proved for drift compensation in E-nose.\nFor studying the variations of recognition accuracy with the number k of labeled samples in target domain, different number k from the set of {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50} is explored by Algorithm 3 (SSA) and the proposed DAELM framework. Specifically, we present comparisons with different number of labeled samples selected from target domains. For fair comparison with ELM, the labeled target samples are feed into ELM together with the source training samples. The results for experimental Setting 1 and Setting 2 are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, respectively, from which, we have: 1. The traditional ELM has little obvious improvement with\nthe increase of the labeled samples from target domains, which clearly demonstrates that ELM has no the capability of knowledge adaptation. 2. Both DAELM-S and DAELM-T have significant enhancement in classification accuracy with increasing labeled data from target domain. Note that in batch 2 and batch 10 shown in Fig. 8, our DAELM is comparative to ELM. The possible reason may be that little drift exist in batch 2 that leads to the small difference in classification task. While the data in batch 10 may be seriously noised by drift, the E-nose system may lose recognition ability only using batch 1 (Setting 1) for training. The proposed DAELM is still much better than ELM when tested on the seriously noised batch 10 in Setting 2 (Fig. 9).\n3. DAELM-S has superior performance to DAELM-T when the number k of labeled target samples used in knowledge adaptation is smaller, because DAELM-T does not consider the source data in classifier learning. Additionally, with the increase of the number k, DAELM-T has a comparative performance with DAELM-S which maybe a better choice when only a small number of labeled samples in target domain are available.\nThroughout the paper, the proposed DAELM framework is to cope with sensor drift in the perspective of machine learning in decision level, but not intuitively calibrate the single sensor response because the drift rules are difficult to be captured by some linear or nonlinear regression method due to its nonlinear/chaotic dynamic behavior. This work is to construct a learning framework with better knowledge adaptability and generalization capability to drift noise existing in dataset."

      "heading" : "V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "In this paper, the sensor drift problem in electronic nose is addressed by a new knowledge adaptation based machine learning approach. We have proposed a new framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), for fast knowledge transfer. Specifically, two algorithms, called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for drift compensation. The former learns a robust classifier based on the source domain by leveraging a limited number of labeled samples from target domain. The latter learns a classifier based on a limited number of labeled data in target domain by leveraging a pre-learned base classifier in source domain. From the angle of machine learning, the proposed methods provide new perspectives for exploring ELM theory, and also inherit the advantages of ELM including the feature mapping with\nrandomly generated input weights and bias, the analytically determined solutions, and good generalization. Another important contribution, the key of this paper, is an effective measure using domain adaptation and ELM framework to cope with sensor drift in E-nose. Experiment on a long term sensor drift data set collected by E-nose clearly demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed framework. Additionally, the proposed framework can realize the recognition directly from the output (16) or (26) of algorithm without any cumbersome measure, which is completely different from SVM based methods that multi-class problem should be divided into multiple binary classification using “one against one” or “one against all” strategy and obtain the predicted label by voting mechanism. It is worth noting that the training time and testing time of proposed algorithms costs about several seconds and microseconds, respectively, due to the analytically determined solutions intuitively without iterations in learning process. In the future, we will investigate on-line domain adaptation for drift compensation in E-nose from the viewpoint of incremental learning. It would be of interest to explore the nonlinear dynamic behavior of drift by constructing on-line dynamic classifiers with knowledge adaptation.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Dr. Alexander Vergara in University of California San Diego for his provided sensor drift data in electronic nose. The authors would also like to express their sincere appreciation to the anonymous reviewers for their\ninsightful comments."

    "abstractText" : " Abstract—This paper addresses an important issue, known as sensor drift that behaves a nonlinear dynamic property in electronic nose (E-nose), from the viewpoint of machine learning. Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing drift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new perspectives for ELM.",
