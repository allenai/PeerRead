      "text" : "In the past two decades, a number of metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed to solve complex real-world optimization problems. Most of these algorithms are nature inspired methods and therefore mimic natural metaphors such as, evolution of species (GA [1] and DE [2-3]), annealing process (SA [4-5]), ant behaviour (ACO [6]), swarm behaviour (PSO [7] and ABC [8- 9]) etc. These algorithms make few or no assumptions for the problem at hand and provide fast and robust solutions. Although, the solutions provided by metaheuristics may not be optimal solutions, they are highly preferred because of their simplicity and flexibility. Despite the high number of available metaheuristics, developing new metaheuristic algorithms is still an active research area. In [10-15], a number of recently proposed metaheuristics can be found. All of these metaheuristics have certain characteristics and thus each one may be more successful on a certain optimization problem when compared to the others. The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm [16] is one of these recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of the stirred fluids. The search behaviour of the VS algorithm is modelled as a vortex pattern by using an adaptive step-size adjustment scheme. By this way, it is aimed to have a good balance between the explorative and exploitative behaviour of the search.\nThe proposed VS algorithm was tested over 50 benchmark mathematical functions and the obtained results compared to the single-solution based (Simulated Annealing, SA and Pattern Search, PS) and population-based (Particle Swarm Optimization, PSO2011 and Artificial Bee Colony, ABC) algorithms. A Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test was performed to measure the pairwise statistical performances of the algorithms, the results of which indicated that the proposed VS algorithm outperforms the SA, PS and ABC algorithms while being competitive with the PSO2011 algorithm. Because of the simplicity of the proposed VS algorithm, a significant decrease in the computational time of the 50 benchmark numerical functions was also achieved when compared to the population-based algorithms. In some other studies [17-20], the VS algorithm has also been successfully used for the solution of some real-world optimization problems. Although the proposed VS algorithm is a good candidate for the solution of optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. In the VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best solution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides simplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along. Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to select a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to being trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-size adjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the created candidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if the algorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes much more difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latter iterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposed to overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVS algorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around different points at each iteration pass. These points are iteratively updated during the search process, details of which are given in the following section. The MVS algorithm is again tested by using the 50 benchmark mathematical functions that was used earlier in [16]. Because the SA and PS algorithms showed poor performances in [16], in this study these two algorithms are excluded and the results are compared to the results those obtained by the VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABC algorithms. It is shown that, the MVS algorithm outperforms all of these algorithms and can successfully find the known global minimum points of the functions that the VS algorithm being trapped into the local minimum points earlier. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In the following section, first a brief description of the VS algorithm is given. Then, the modification performed on the VS algorithm is detailed and the MVS algorithm is introduced. Section 3 covers the experimental results and discussion. Finally, Section 4 concludes the work."

      "text" : "Let us consider a two-dimensional optimization problem. In a two dimensional space a vortex pattern can be modelled by a number of nested circles. Here, the outer (largest) circle of the vortex is first centered on the search space, where the initial center can be calculated using Eq. 1.\n2\nlowerlimitupperlimit µ0 + =\n(1)\nIn Eq.1, upperlimit and lowerlimit are 1×d vectors that define the bound constraints of the\nproblem in d dimensional space. Then, a number of neighbor solutions )(sCt , ( t represents\nthe iteration index and initially 0=t ) are randomly generated around the initial center 0µ in the d -dimensional space by using a Gaussian distribution. Here, { } nkssssC k ,...,2,1,...,,)( 210 == represents the solutions, and n represents the total number of candidate solutions. In Eq. 2, the general form of the multivariate Gaussian distribution is given.\n      −Σ−−\nΣ\n=Σ − )()(\n2\n1 exp\n)2(\n1 ),|( 1 µµ\nπ µ xxxp T d\n(2)\nIn Eq.2, d represents the dimension, x is the 1×d vector of a random variable, µ is the 1×d\nvector of sample mean (center) and Σ is the covariance matrix. If the diagonal elements (variances) of the values of Σ are equal and if the off-diagonal elements (covariance) are zero (uncorrelated), then the resulting shape of the distribution will be spherical (which can be considered circular for a two-dimensional problem, as in our case). Thus, the value of Σ can be computed by using equal variances with zero covariance by using Eq. 3.\n[ ] ddI ×⋅=Σ 2σ (3)\nIn Eq. 3, 2σ represents the variance of the distribution and I represents the dd × identity\nmatrix. The initial standard deviation ( 0σ ) of the distribution can be calculated by using Eq. 4.\n2\n)min()max( 0 lowerlimitupperlimit − =σ\n(4)\nHere, 0σ can also be considered as the initial radius ( 0r ) of the outer circle for a two\ndimensional optimization problem. Because a weak locality is required in the initial phases, 0r is chosen to be a large value. Thus, a full coverage of the search space by the outer circle is provided in the initial step. This process provides a bird's-eye view for the problem at hand.\nIn the selection phase, a solution (which is the best one) )(0 ' sCs ∈ is selected and memorized\nfrom )(0 sC to replace the current circle center 0µ . Prior to the selection phase, the candidate solutions must be ensured to be inside the search boundaries. For this purpose, the solutions that exceed the boundaries are shifted into the boundaries, as in Eq. 5.\n  \n \n\n>+−⋅\n≤≤\n<+−⋅\n=\nii k iii\nii k ii k\nii k iii\ni k\nupperlimit s,lowerlimit)lowerlimitt(upperlimirand\nupperlimit slowerlimit,s\nlowerlimit s,lowerlimit)lowerlimitt(upperlimirand\ns\n(5)\nIn Eq.5, nk ,...2,1= and di ,...,2,1= and rand is a uniformly distributed random number. Next,\nthe memorized best solution '\ns is assigned to be the center of the second circle (the inner one). In the generation phase of the second step, the effective radius ( 1r ) of this new circle is reduced, and then, a new set of solutions )(1 sC is generated around the new center. Note that in the second step, the locality of the generated neighbors increased with the decreased radius. In the selection phase of the second step, the new set of solutions )(1 sC is evaluated to select a solution\n)(1 ' sCs ∈ . If the selected solution is better than the best solution found so far, then this solution is assigned to be the new best solution and it is memorized. Next, the center of the third circle is\nassigned to be the memorized best solution found so far. This process iterates until the termination condition is met. An illustrative sketch of the process is given in Figure 1. In this manner, once the algorithm is terminated, the resulting pattern appears as a vortex-like structure, where the center of the smallest circle is the optimum point found by the algorithm. A representative pattern is sketched in Figure 2 for a two-dimensional optimization problem for which the upper and lower limits are between the [-10,10] interval. A description of the VS algorithm is also provided in Figure 3. The radius decrement process given in Figure 3 can be considered as a type of adaptive step-size adjustment process which has critical importance on the performance of the VS algorithm. This process should be performed in such a way that allows the algorithm to behave in an explorative manner in the initial steps and in an exploitative manner in the latter steps. To achieve this type of process, the value of the radius must be tuned properly during the search process. In the VS algorithm, the inverse incomplete gamma function is used to decrease the value of the radius during each iteration pass.\nThe incomplete gamma function given in Eq. 6 most commonly arises in probability theory, particularly in those applications involving the chi-square distribution [21].\n∫ >= −−\nx at\nadtteax\n0\n1 0),(γ\n(6)\nIn Eq.6, 0>a is known as the shape parameter and 0≥x is a random variable. In conjunction with the incomplete gamma function, its complementary ),( axΓ is usually also introduced (Eq. 7).\n∫ ∞ −− >=Γ\nx\nat adtteax 0),( 1\n(7)\nThus, it follows that, )(),(),( aaxax Γ=Γ+γ (8)\nwhere )(aΓ is known as the gamma function. There exist many studies in the literature on\ndifferent proposed methods for the numerical calculation of the incomplete gamma function [22- 24]. MATLAB® also provides some tools for the calculation of the inverse incomplete gamma (gammaincinv) function. The inverse incomplete gamma function (gammaincinv), computes the inverse of the incomplete gamma function with respect to the integration limit x and represented as gammaincinv(x,a) in MATLAB®.\nIn Figure 4, the inverse incomplete gamma function is plotted for 1.0=x and [ ]1,0∈a . Here, for our case the parameter a of the inverse incomplete gamma function defines the resolution of\nthe search. By equally sampling a values within [ ]1,0 interval at a certain step size, the\nresolution of the search can be adjusted. For this purpose, at each iteration, a value of a is computed by using the Eq.9\nMaxItr\nt aat −= 0\n(9)\nwhere 0a is selected as 10 =a to ensure a full coverage of the search space at the first iteration, t is the iteration index, and MaxItr represents the maximum number of iterations. Let us consider an optimization problem defined within the [-10,10] region. The initial radius 0r can be calculated with Eq. 10.

      "text" : "The VS algorithm creates candidate solutions around a single point at each iteration pass. At the first iteration, this point is the initial center 0µ which is determined with the upper and lower limits of the problem at hand while in the latter iterations the center is shifted to the current best position found so far. As mentioned before, this mechanism leads the VS algorithm to being trapped into local minimum points for a number of functions. To overcome above mentioned drawback, in this study a modified VS algorithm (MVS) is proposed. In the MVS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around multiple centers at\neach iterations pass. The search behavior of the MVS algorithm can be thought as a number of parallel vortices that have different centers at each iteration pass. Initially, the centers of these multiple vortices are selected as in the VS algorithm. Let us consider, the total number of centers (or vortices) to be represented by m . Let us say, )(µtM represents the matrix that stores the values of these m centers at each iteration pass and t represents the iteration index.

Thus, one should select mn solutions around each center.\nLet us say, { } mnkssssCS k l t ,...,2,1,...,,)( 21 == represents the subset of solutions generated around the center ml ,...,2,1= for the iteration t .

In the selection phase, for each subset of solutions, a solution (which is the best one) )(0 ' sCSs l l ∈ is selected. Prior to the selection phase it must be ensured that the candidate subsets of solutions are inside the search boundaries. For this purpose, the solutions that exceed the boundaries are shifted into the boundaries, as in Eq. 5.

However, in the MVS algorithm, there exist m centers which positions need to be updated for the next iteration. The most important difference between the VS and MVS algorithm arises from here. In the MVS algorithm, one of these centers is again shifted to the best solution found so far, bests . But, the remaining 1−m centers are shifted to a new position determined by the best positions generated around the each center at the iteration t and the best\nposition found so far, bests as shown in Eq. 13.\n)( '' bestll l t ssrands +⋅+=µ\n(13)\nIn Eq. 13, rand is a uniformly distributed random number, 1,...,2,1 −= ml and\n)( '1 ' sPBests tl −∈ .

At each iteration pass, the radius is decreased by utilizing the inverse incomplete gamma function and thus, the locality of the generated solutions is increased. In Figure 6, a description of the MVS algorithm is provided."

      "text" : "The proposed MVS algorithm is compared to the VS, PSO2011 and ABC algorithms by using the 50 benchmark functions given in Table 1. For each algorithm, 30 different runs are performed, and the mean and the best values are recorded. The maximum number of iterations is selected to be 500,000. For the MATLAB® codes of the PSO2011, ABC, VS and MVS algorithms please refer to [25], [28], [29] and [30]. For each algorithm, all of the functions are run in parallel using a 32 core Intel® CPU 32 GB RAM workstation. For the first set of experiments, results are given in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, for the MVS algorithm two different cases are considered. In the first case, the total number of candidate solutions is selected to be 50, which means 10 candidate solutions are generated around each center for 5=m . In this case, the MVS algorithm can avoid from the local minimum points for the functions F13, F16, F17, F22, F23, F41, and F43 which is not the case for the VS algorithm. However, poor sampling of the search space for this case (10 points around each center) leads the MVS algorithm to show a correspondingly poor performance on the improvement of the found near optimal solutions (exploitation) for some of the functions. This can be clearly seen in the pair-wise statistical comparison of the algorithms given in Table 3. The pair-wise statistical comparison of the algorithms is obtained by a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. The null hypothesis H0 for this test is: \"There is no difference between the median of the solutions produced by algorithm A and the median of the solutions produced by algorithm B for the same benchmark problem\", i.e., median (A) = median (B). To determine whether algorithm A reached a statistically better solution than algorithm B, or if not, whether the alternative hypothesis is valid, the sizes of the ranks provided by the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (i.e., T+ and T-, as defined in [10]) are examined. Because an arithmetic precision value that is higher than necessary makes it difficult to compare the local search abilities of the algorithms, during the statistical pair-wise comparison, resulting values below are considered as 0. In Table 3, ‘+’ indicates cases in which the null hypothesis is rejected and the MVS algorithm exhibited a statistically superior performance in the pair-wise Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test at the 95% significance level ( 05.0=α ); ‘-’ indicates cases in which the null hypothesis is rejected and the MVS algorithm exhibited an inferior performance; and ‘=’ indicates cases in which there is no statistical different between two algorithms. The last row of the Table 3 shows the total count of (+/=/-) for the three statistical significance cases in the pair-wise comparison.\nAs shown in Table 3, the VS algorithm outperforms the MVS algorithm for the functions F5, F10, F11, F38, and F42. But when the results given in Table 2 are compared for these functions, it can be clearly seen that this difference mainly arises because of the poor exploitation ability of the MVS algorithm with 50 candidate solutions. Therefore, another case in which the total number of candidate solutions is selected to be 250 is considered for the MVS algorithm. In this case, 50 candidate solutions are generated around each center for 5=m . As can be shown in Table 2, the MVS algorithm with 250 candidate solutions performs better than the MVS algorithm with 50 candidate solutions.

In [31], authors stated that after a sufficient value for colony size, any increment in the value does not improve the performance of the ABC algorithm significantly. For the test problems carried out in [31] colony sizes of 10, 50 and 100 are used for the ABC algorithm. It is shown\nthat although from 10 to 50 the performance of the ABC algorithm significantly increased, there is not any significant difference between the performances achieved by 50 and 100 colony sizes. Similarly, for the PSO algorithm it is reported that, PSO with different population sizes has almost the similar performance which means the performance of PSO is not sensitive to the population size [32]. Based on the above considerations, in this study a comparison of the MVS algorithm to the ABC and PSO2011 algorithms with a different population size is not performed. For the VS algorithm it is expected to achieve better exploitation ability with an increased number of candidate solutions. But the problem with the VS algorithm is with its global search ability rather than the local search ability for some of the functions listed above. Therefore, a comparison of the MVS (m = 5, n = 50) to VS algorithm with 50 candidate solutions is thought to be enough to show the improvement achieved by the modification performed on the VS algorithm. In Figure 7, the average computational time of 30 runs for 500,000 iterations is also provided for the MVS (m = 5, n = 50), MVS (m = 5, n = 250), VS, PSO2011 and ABC algorithms. As shown in this figure, the required computational time to perform 500,000 iterations with the MVS algorithm is slightly increased when compared to the VS algorithm. However, even for the MVS (m = 5, n = 250) algorithm the required computational time to perform 500,000 iterations is still lower than the PSO2011 and ABC algorithms."

    "abstractText" : "The Vortex Search (VS) algorithm is one of the recently proposed metaheuristic algorithms which was inspired from the vortical flow of the stirred fluids. Although the VS algorithm is shown to be a good candidate for the solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. In the VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best solution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides simplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along. Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to select a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to being trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-size adjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the created candidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if the algorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes much more difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latter iterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposed to overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVS algorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points at each iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of this modification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improved and the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABC algorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.",
