The Japanese writing system makes extensive use of Chinese characters, also known as kanji , along with scripts, hiragana and katakana, which are syllabic.\nThere are 3 main lexical classes in Japanese that exhibit morphology, they are the nouns, verbs and adjectives. In Japanese, adverbs are often adjectives suffixed with a special morpheme. As such, it is often not considered a separate class of words. In §4, we will discuss the phenomenon for each of these word classes."

      "text" : "In traditional Japanese morphological analysis, a lexicon is assumed. The lexicon is a list of pairs of a word and its corresponding part-of-speech. As Japanese is an unsegmented language, past work on Japanese language morphology analyzers require the use of a segmenter. Often, the segmentation step is conducted jointly with the morphological analysis step in a rule based [Matsumoto et al., 1991] or machine learning framework [Kudo et al., 2004, Matsumoto et al., 1999].\nThe current state of the art Japanese language part of speech and morphological analyzer is MeCab2 [Matsumoto et al., 1999], which is an extended from ChaSen3 [Matsumoto et al., 1991], but using CRFs[Lafferty et al., 2001] instead of HMMs to model the morpheme sequences.\n∗This morphological analyzer is done as part of the project requirements for the Spring 2013 NLP Lab (11-712) at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\protect\\unhbox\\voidb@x\\penalty\\@M\\{}nasmith/NLPLab/).\n1The source code and tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/skylander/yc-nlplab/ . 2http://mecab.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mecab/doc/index.html 3http://chasen-legacy.sourceforge.jp/\n1\nMeCab segments words and provides annotations for 69 different part of speech categories4. These categories, although comprehensive, do not cover the certain morphological phenomena in detail, such as the differences between honorifics used with Japanese nouns, and the finer grammatical attributes of verbal and adjectival conjugations. In this lab, we will seek to improve upon current morphological analysis tools by filling in these missing gaps."

      "text" : "Nouns are usually not inflected. However, the Japanese language do have an extensive honorific system, and nouns often take politeness prefixes and suffixes (for animate objects), a small group of suffixes are also used to refer to collective nouns.\nHonorific prefixes The prefixes o- (お-) and go- (ご-) are prefixes applied to nouns (and sometimes verbs) to convey a respectful or polite tone of speech. Native Japanese words are preceded by o- while Sino-Japanese words are usually preceded by go-, although there are exceptions to both cases.\n4http://mecab.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mecab/doc/posid.html\n2 of 11\nHonorific suffixes Honorific suffixes are almost always attached to person names and occasionally other non-human objects (such as animals, inanimate objects, etc). These suffixes depend on the formality of the dialogue, the speaker’s familiarity and status difference with the referred person, as well as the gender/age of the referred person.\nCollective suffixes Collective suffixes are appended to nouns to signify a collective group of the noun. These suffixes are often used with singular pronouns to refer to its plural counterpart. Common collective suffixes are -tachi and -ra. Occasionally, these suffixes maybe used with proper animate nouns to signify a group including the mentioned noun (collective, not pluralizing). For instance, Tanaka-tachi maybe translated as ‘Tanaka and his friends’ or ‘Tanaka and his family’ but not ‘some people named Tanaka’. We take this distinction into account when collective suffixes are used in the context of pronouns.\nPronouns Japanese is a pro-drop language, and hence are used less frequently than in English. Hence, pronouns are usually treated morphologically like nouns and plural pronouns are formed with collective suffixes. In addition, pronouns are considered an open lexical class (since it behaves just like a noun), which means that new pronouns are being “created” to be used in specialized contexts (age, familiarity, different levels of formality, etc). As such, we will only consider pronouns that are found in our corpus."

Unlike western languages where adjectives are usually inflected similar to noun declensions, Japanese adjectives are conjugated like a verb. This is because words that behave semantically as adjectives are technically considered as specialized verbs (i -adjectives) or nominals (na-adjectives). There are several other classes of adjectives, which are more commonly used in Classical Japanese, and in Modern Japanese are limited to a select few special cases. There are two main classes of adjectives: adjectival verbs and adjectival nouns."

Hence, we will design our analyzer to take input from the processed output of MeCab, a high quality state of the art Japanese part of speech tagger and morphological analyzer. MeCab is a CRF classifier that segments and tags each tokens with a part of speech category. It has a hierarchical tag set (of up to 4 levels), starting with 8 coarse categories and 68 fine categories in total. In the case of nouns, it provides a coarse morphological analysis by segmenting the morphemes for honorifics and collectivism and classifying it as suffixes or prefixes belonging to persons, locations, quantifiers, etc. Hence, our contribution would be to incorporate finer details of classification such as politeness and gender attributes. Details of our implementation for nouns would be described in §5.3.\nFor verbs, adjectives and adverbs, the morphemes are not segmented as the surface forms undergo various morphophonological changes. Thus, the analysis by MeCab is limited to the forms of the verbs and its lemma. Our analyzer will therefore focus on extracting the morphological attributes such as tense, mood, voice, etc. The details of our implementation for verbs will be discussed in §7.\nFigure 4 shows the high level view of our morphological analyzer pipeline."

We will do this using a Python script and the input to the FST would be\nN#<token1>/<pos_id1> <token2>/<pos_id2> ...$\nFor some nouns, the prefixes and suffixes have been segmented into separate tokens. Thus, an input may consist of several tokens with different part of speech IDs.\nNoun morphology phenomena The following noun morphology are handled by our analyzer:\n1. Honorific prefixes: お-, ご- (common) and御- (usually only found in literary writings). Output will be marked with a +polite attribute.\n2. Formal/informal honorific suffixes for animate objects: -ちゃん, -さん, -君 and -様. For - ちゃん and -君, the output will be marked with +informal, while -様 will be marked with +formal. The very common -さん suffix is not tagged formal/informal because the use of it is standard in Japanese (as a default polite form) and hence its use do not convey much politeness information beyond that of typical social scenarios. However, all objects with honorific suffixes mentioned above will have an +animate attribute.\n3. Collective suffixes: 達, 等, 方, たち, ら and かた. Output will be marked with a +collective attribute.\n4. Table 2 presents a list of pronouns that are handled by our analyzer and their morphological attributes. Furthermore, consecutive sequences of pronouns-collectives are handled as a single entity even if MeCab segments them into separate tokens (i.e +plural instead of +collective).\n5.

We refer the user to a comprehensive grammar guidebook for more information about the stem forms. Here, we will briefly describe the morpheme suffixes that are handled by our analyzer. We will now describe the suffixes that are analyzed by our system:\nIn addition, there are also many auxiliaries that compound with non te-form stems.\n6. Conditional moods (+cond) are used in conditionals and denoted (usually) by the -ba (-ば) and -ra (-ら) suffixes.\n7 of 11\n7.

One such common and regular rule is phonological change when ending with a [t] consonant. For example te-form verb endings -ite, -chite, -rite change to a double consonant, -tte, endings in -bite, -mite, -nite change to -nde (voicing of the te syllable), endings in -kite change to -ite, and endings in -gite change to -ide (voicing of the te syllable). The above double consonants and voicing patterns also applies when dealing with perfective aspect endings -ta.\nThere are also numerous contractions that are used in colloquial conversations. For instance, the progressive marker -teiru becomes -teru and -teshimau becomes -chau."

      "heading" : "7.3 FST as a generator",
      "text" : "Due to the agglutinative nature of the language, the morphemes suffixes can be added in many different arbitrary order. Hence, we have designed the FST as a generator, meaning the output of the FST is the surface form of a conjugated verb and the input is its lemma and morphological feature. The FST inherently has no knowledge of valid or invalid orderings of these suffixes and thus tend to over generate surface forms for a particular input.\nWhen the FST is being used, it is trivial to reverse the direction of the FST, and return the underlying form of the verb token. However, it is very possible for a verb token to have multiple analysis and it is up to the downstream application to decide between possible analyses.\n7.4 Adjective morphology phenomena\n. As described in §4.3, there are two main classes of adjectives, and we describe how our analyzer handle them here.\nAdjectival verbs (i-adjectives) end with -i (-い) and can be conjugated with almost all the suffixes for verbs. These adjectives are also often found in predicate positions, denoting their verb-like nature. For instance, when a verb takes on a -nai negation suffix, it can be treated morphologically like an i-adjective, and likewise, when an i -adjective is conjugated for te-form, it behaves just like any other te-form verb.\nAdjectival nouns (na-adjectives) always occur with a form of the copula -da (-だ). Because adjectival nouns are usually formed from nouns, it has led many linguists to consider them a type of nominal. The copula (considered an irregular ichidan verb) can conjugated just like any other verb. It is thus treated as such by our analyzers.\n8 of 11\nOther adjective classes have limited use in modern Japanese. In our analyzer, we have chosen to ignore these adjectives and not analyze them."

From all the tokens, we extracted 2,000 verb and 1,000 adjective tokens for manual evaluation. Since for each token, the FST produce multiple analyses (there can also be multiple valid analyses absent context), we measure the precision/recall performance of our analyzer. Precision is computed by\n1\n|evaluation set|\n∑\ni∈evaluation set\n# of correct analyses\n# of analyses\nand recall is computed by\n1\n|evaluation set|\n∑\ni∈evaluation set\nI(# of correct analyses > 0)\nTable 5 presents the results of our evaluation. Since our FST over generates (see table 6 and 7 for such examples), we were able to obtain reasonably good recall. However, we missed many items due to a lack of coverage in our lexicon. The Japanese-Multilingual dictionary, though comprehensive, does not provide coverage of all the lexical items that appeared in the Tanaka corpus. This problem is more pronounced in verbs due to verbs being a much larger and more productive lexical class.\nThe precision for our verb analysis were quite low, which we attribute to the agglutinative nature of the language. The morpheme suffixes are a productive class, and the Tanaka corpus contain a significant amount of conversational text and colloquial language. On the other hand, adjectives tend to exhibit far lesser conjugations and hence we are able to achieve better precision. In fact, 77.4% of the surface forms in the adjective evaluation set were found to be in dictionary form (i.e were not conjugated). Adjectives are usually conjugated when they are used in the predicate position."

It is an agglutinative language with a SOV word order. The Japanese writing system makes extensive use of Chinese characters, also known as kanji , along with scripts, hiragana and katakana, which are syllabic. There are 3 main lexical classes in Japanese that exhibit morphology, they are the nouns, verbs and adjectives. In Japanese, adverbs are often adjectives suffixed with a special morpheme. As such, it is often not considered a separate class of words. In §4, we will discuss the phenomenon for each of these word classes. 2 Past Work on the Japanese morphology In traditional Japanese morphological analysis, a lexicon is assumed. The lexicon is a list of pairs of a word and its corresponding part-of-speech. As Japanese is an unsegmented language, past work on Japanese language morphology analyzers require the use of a segmenter. Often, the segmentation step is conducted jointly with the morphological analysis step in a rule based [Matsumoto et al., 1991] or machine learning framework [Kudo et al., 2004, Matsumoto et al., 1999]. The current state of the art Japanese language part of speech and morphological analyzer is MeCab [Matsumoto et al., 1999], which is an extended from ChaSen [Matsumoto et al., 1991], but using CRFs[Lafferty et al., 2001] instead of HMMs to model the morpheme sequences. ∗This morphological analyzer is done as part of the project requirements for the Spring 2013 NLP Lab (11-712) at Carnegie Mellon University (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/\\protect\\unhbox\\voidb@x\\penalty\\@M\\{}nasmith/NLPLab/).
