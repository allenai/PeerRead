For simplicity, a Markov model assumption is made such that the predicted formation of the opponent team only depends on its current formation. The field is divided into a grid and a robot state per player is created with information about its position and its velocity. To gather a more general sense of what the opposing team is doing, the state also incorporates the team's average position (centroid). All possible state transitions are stored in a hash table that requires minimum storage space. The table is populated with transition probabilities that are learned by reading vision packages and counting the state transitions regardless of the specific robot player. Therefore, the computation during the game is reduced to interpreting a given vision package to assign each player to a state, and looking for the most likely state it will transition to. The confidence of the predicted team's formation is the product of each individual player's probability. The project is noteworthy in that it minimizes the time and space complexity requirements for opponent's moves prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 20:23:21 GMT  (959kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01446v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["selene baez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01446"}
