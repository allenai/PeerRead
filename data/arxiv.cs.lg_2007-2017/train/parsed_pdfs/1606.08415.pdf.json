      "text" : "The sigmoid function was once the most popular nonlinear activation function for neural networks. Despite having a probabilistic interpretation, it has fallen out of favor due to slow and inaccurate convergence. In contrast, the widely-used ReLU activation usually demonstrates superior convergence yet is lacking in terms of its probabilistic interpretation [8]. Both nonlinearities increase monotonically and thus yield greater outputs for greater inputs—their utility lies in how they respond to their input.\nSome neural network regularization strategies, in contrast, act irrespectively of a neuron’s value. For example, dropout randomly sets neuron values to zero, and zoneout randomly preserves previously computed neuron values [10, 5]. Dropout can act as a stochastic zero map, and zoneout can act as a stochastic identity map. The ReLU is a deterministic zero map or identity map, depending on the input value. But this determinism of the ReLU is limiting; the stochasticity of dropout and zoneout may allow for a pseudo-ensemble [1] of networks with stochastic width or stochastic depth, respectively, and this leads to improved performance [3, 11]. Since ReLUs lack stochasticity and since the aforementioned regularizers are irrespective of their input, the innovations have remained distinct. In this paper, we bridge the gap between nonlinearities and stochastic regularizers by considering a stochastic process that is dependent upon input values. We encapsulate the stochastic process into a deterministic activation function that we call the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU). In experiments across several tasks, we find GELU activations to outperform both ReLU and ELU activations.\n2 GELUs and the Stochastic 0-I Map\nWe begin by describing the stochastic process that underlies the GELU nonlinearity. We call the process the stochastic 0-I map (SOI map). Before expounding on this map, we establish\n∗Work done while the author was at TTIC.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n08 41\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 Ju\nn 20\nmotivating assumptions. To start, let us initialize each column of the neural networks weights W ∈ Rnin×nout uniformly on the surface of (not inside) the unit hypersphere, and let the input data X ∈ Rbatch size×nin have a standard normal distribution. As a consequence, it we let Z = XW , it follows that Zij is from a standard normal distribution. Now, we have seen that both the sigmoid and ReLU assign greater values to greater inputs; we wish to have a stochastic process which tends to do this. So, we define the SOI map as randomly applying the identity map to an input with probability Φ(Zij) = P (Y ≤ Zij), Y ∼ N (0, 1) and applying the zero map otherwise. This introduces nondeterminism but maintains dependency upon the input value.\nWe can recover a deterministic function from this process to obtain a traditional nonlinearity. The expected transformation to an input x is Φ(x) × Ix + (1 − Φ(x)) × 0x = xΦ(x). We now make an obvious generalization. Since the cumulative distribution function is computed with the error function, we define the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) as\nGELU(x) = xFX(x) = xP (X ≤ x)\nwhere X ∼ N (µ, σ2). Both µ and σ are possibly parameters to optimize, but throughout this paper we simply let µ = 0 and σ = 1.\nThe GELU bears semblance to the ReLU and ELU (see [2] for an ELU description). For example, as σ → 0 and if µ = 0, the GELU becomes a ReLU. More, the ReLU and GELU are equal asymptotically. Unlike the ReLU, the GELU and ELU can be both negative and positive. In fact, if we used the cumulative distribution function of the standard Cauchy distribution, then the ELU (when α = 1/π or ELU(x) = 1(x > 0)x + 1π1(x ≤ 0)(e\nx − 1), where 1 is the indicator function) is xFC(x), C ∼ Cauchy(0, 1) asymptotically. These are some fundamental relations to previous nonlinearities.\nHowever, the GELU has several notable differences. This non-convex, non-monotonic function is not linear in the positive domain and exhibits curvature at all points. Meanwhile ReLUs and ELUs, which are convex and monotonic activations, are linear in the positive domain and do not always exhibit curvature. Increased curvature and non-monotonicity may allow GELUs to more easily approximate complicated functions than can RELUs or ELUs. In addition and significantly, the GELU has a probabilistic interpretation given that it is the expected SOI map."

      "text" : "Next, we demonstrate that for more intricate architectures with dropout the GELU nonlinearity again outperforms other nonlinearities. We use a convolutional architecture with the stacks (2×3×32), (2×3×64) representing the number of layers, receptive field, and number of filters, respectively. We then feed this output through a two layer network with 512 and 256 neurons for the two layers. We apply max-pooling after every stack, and we run two experiments: we apply no dropout or use dropout rates of 0.25 after the first stack, 0.25 after the second stack, and 0.5 before the last fully-connected layer. As ever, we use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and initialize weights on the unit hypersphere (each filter has an `2 norm of one). Figure 4 shows the results. In both situations, GELUs provide faster and superior convergence. Consequently, although the GELU is inspired by a different stochastic process, it comports well with dropout."

      "heading" : "4 Discussion",
      "text" : "Across several experiments, the GELU outperformed previous nonlinearities, but there are minor cautions. The MNIST experiments are similar to those run by the architects of the ELU, but unlike their experiments, we use Adam instead of ordinary gradient descent because Adam\n1Afterward, we tried a 10−2 learning rate but all solutions poorly converged, GELUs tied with ReLUs, and ELUs diverged.\nbetter reflects what is typically used in practice for training neural networks. Interestingly, this change causes ELUs to occasionally perform worse than ReLUs. Furthermore, by the GELU’s difference in convexity and monotonicity, we find that an optimizer with momentum is important for allowing GELUs to converge well, while previous nonlinearities do not have this (minor) drawback. This suggests GELUs generate an error surface unlike those generated by ReLUs. Also, like exp(·) and σ(·), the error function is expensive to compute accurately, but fast approximations exist. It is also worth mentioning why we did not display the SOI map performance in the above experiments. We now show one such example of its performance in Figure 5. Clearly, it can replace nonlinearities occasionally. For example, on the MNIST Classification tasks, it outperforms the ELU nonlinearity—a neural network with only a regularization process can outperform a network with a nonlinearity. It achieves low validation log loss as a consequence of its regularizing stochasticity. However, adjusting the extent to which the SOI map regularizes is currently unclear, thus we cannot yet recommend using the SOI map as a nonlinearity replacement."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We observed that the GELU outperforms previous nonlinearities across several tasks. Importantly for future work, this nonlinearity has a probabilistic interpretation and may thus lead to a deeper understanding of the feedforward process as a whole. Other future research avenues include researching the LaLU, xFL(x), L ∼ Laplace(0, 1), as this may encourage neuron sparsity. Another avenue is finding a useful way to apply the SOI map across many different tasks because it remains unclear how best to modify the extent to which the SOI map regularizes. Fortunately, the GELU does not require any apparent adjustment to exceed the accuracy of previous nonlinearities."
