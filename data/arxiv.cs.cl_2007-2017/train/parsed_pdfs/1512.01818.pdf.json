There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Thus, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This study aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty one popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of twenty labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies widely across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods’ codes and datasets used in this paper and we deploy a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.\nCCS Concepts: rInformation systems → Sentiment analysis; rNetworks → Social media networks; Online social networks;\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Sentiment analysis, social media, online social networks, sentence-level"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Sentiment analysis has become an extremely popular tool, applied in several analytical domains, especially on the Web and social media. To illustrate the growth of interest in the field , Figure 1 shows the steady increase on the number of searches on the topic, according to Google Trends1, mainly after the popularization of the online social networks (OSNs). More than 7,000 articles have been written about sentiment analysis and various startups are developing tools and strategies to extract sentiments from text [Feldman 2013].\nThe number of possible applications of such a technique is also considerable. Many of them are focused on monitoring the reputation or opinion of a company or a brand with the analysis of reviews of consumer products or services [Hu and Liu 2004]. Sentiment analysis can also provide analytical perspectives for financial investors who want to discover and respond to market opinions [Oliveira et al. 2013; Bollen et al. 2010]. Another important set of applications is in politics, where marketing campaigns are interested in tracking sentiments expressed by voters associated with candidates [Tumasjan et al. 2010].\nDue to the enormous interest and applicability, there has been a corresponding increase in the number of proposed sentiment analysis methods in the last years. The proposed methods rely on many different techniques from different computer science fields. Some of them employ machine learning methods that often rely on supervised classification approaches, requiring labeled data to train classifiers [Pang et al. 2002]. Others are lexical-based methods that make use of predefined lists of words, in which each word is associated with a specific sentiment. The lexical methods vary according to the context in which they were created. For instance, LIWC [Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010] was originally proposed to analyze sentiment patterns in formally written English\n1https://www.google.com/trends/explore\\#q=sentiment\\%20analysis\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n01 81\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nD ec\n2 01\n5\nsult consistent with the “there is no free lunch theorem” [Wolpert and Macready 1997]. We also show that existing methods vary widely regarding their agreement, even across similar datasets (e.g. random tweets). This suggests that the same content could be interpreted very differently depending on the choice of a sentiment method. We noted that most methods are more accurate in correctly classifying positive than negative text, suggesting that current existing approaches tend to be biased in their analysis towards positivity. Finally, we quantify the relative prediction performance of existing efforts in the field across different types of datasets, identifying those with higher prediction performance across different datasets.\nBased on these observations, our final contribution consists on releasing our gold standard dataset and the codes of the compared methods2. We also created a Web system through which we allow other researchers to easily use our data and codes to compare results with the existing methods. More important, by using our system one could easily test which method would be the most suitable to a particular dataset and/or application. We hope that our tool will not only help researchers and practitioners for accessing and comparing a wide range of sentiment analysis techniques, but can also help towards the development of this research field as a whole.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe related efforts. Then, in Section 3 we describe the sentiment analysis methods we compare. Section 4 presents the gold standard data used for comparison. Section 5 summarizes our results and findings. Finally, Section 6 concludes the article and discusses directions for future work."

      "heading" : "2.1. Focus on Sentiment Level",
      "text" : "Since sentiment analysis can be applied to different tasks, we restrict our focus on comparing those efforts related to detect the polarity (i.e. positivity or negativity) of a given short text (i.e. sentencelevel). Polarity detection is a common function across all sentiment methods considered in our work, providing valuable information to a number of different applications, specially those that explore short messages that are commonly available in social media [Feldman 2013].\nSentence-level sentiment analysis can be performed with supervision (i.e. requiring labeled training data) or not. An advantage of supervised methods is at their ability to adapt and create trained models for specific purposes and contexts. A drawback is the need of labeled data, which might be highly costly and even prohibitive for some tasks. On the other hand, the lexical-based methods make use of a pre-defined list of words, where each word is associated with a specific sentiment. The lexical methods vary according to the context in which they were created. For instance, LIWC [Tausczik and Pennebaker 2010] was originally proposed to analyze sentiment patterns in English texts, whereas PANAS-t [Gonçalves et al. 2013b] and POMS-ex [Bollen et al. 2009] are psychometric scales adapted to the Web context. Although lexical-based methods do not rely on labeled data, it is hard to create a unique lexical-based dictionary to be used for different contexts.\nWe focus our effort on evaluating unsupervised efforts as they can be easily deployed in Web services and applications without the need of human labeling or any other type of manual intervention. As described in Section 3, some of the methods we consider have used machine learning to build lexicon dictionaries or even to build models and tune specific parameters. We incorporate those methods in our study, since they have been released as black-box tools that can be used in an unsupervised manner."

Overall, lexical methods and ma-\n2Except for one paid method\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nchine learning approaches have been evolving in parallel in the last years, and it comes as no surprise that studies have started to compare their performance on specific datasets and use one or another strategy as baseline for comparison. A recent survey summarizes several of these efforts [Tsytsarau and Palpanas 2012] and conclude that a systematic comparative study that implements and evaluates all relevant algorithms under the same framework is still missing in the literature. As new methods emerge and compare themselves only against one or other method using different evaluation datasets and testing methodologies, it is hard to conclude if a single method triumphs over the other methods, even under specific scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our effort is the first of kind to create a benchmark and provide such a comparison.\nAnother important worth noticing effort consists of an annual workshop namely International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval). It consists of a series of exercises grouped in tracks, that include sentiment analysis, text similarity, among others, that put together competitors. Some new methods such as Umigon [Levallois 2013] have been proposed after obtaining good results on part of these tracks. Although, SemEval has been playing an important role for identifying the current important methods, it requires authors of the methods to register for the challenge and many popular methods have been evaluated in these exercises. Additionally, SemEval labeled datasets are usually focused on one specific types of data, such as tweets, and do not represent a wide range of social media data. In our evaluation effort, we consider one dataset from Semeval 2013 and two methods that participated in the competition in that same year.\nFinally, in a previous effort [Gonçalves et al. 2013a], we compared eight sentence-level sentiment analysis methods, based on one public dataset used to evaluate the method sentistrength [Thelwall 2013]. Our effort largely extents our previous work by comparing much more methods across many different datasets, providing a much deeper benchmark evaluation of current existing popular sentiment analysis methods. The methods used in this paper were also incorporated as part of an existing system, namely ifeel [Araujo et al. 2014]."

      "heading" : "3. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS METHODS",
      "text" : "This section provides a brief description of the twenty one sentence-level sentiment analysis methods investigated in this paper.\nOur effort to identify important sentence-level sentiment analysis methods consisted of systematically search for them in the main conferences in the field and then checking for papers that cited them as well as their own references. Some of the methods are available for download on the Web; others were kindly shared by their authors under request; and a small part of them were implemented by us based on their descriptions in the original paper. This usually happened when authors shared only the lexical dictionaries they created, letting the implementation of the method that use the lexical resource to ourselves.\nTable I and Table II present an overview of these methods, providing a description of each method as well as the techniques they employ (L for Lexicon Dictionary and ML for Machine Learning), their outputs (e.g. -1,0,1, meaning negative, neutral, and positive, respectively), the datasets they used to validate, the baseline methods used for comparison and finally lexicon details. The methods are organized in chronological order to allow a better overview of the existing efforts over the years. We can note that the methods generate different outputs formats. We colored in blue the positive outputs, in black the neutral ones, and in red those that are negative.\nSince we are comparing sentiment analysis methods on a sentence-level basis, we need to work with mechanisms that are able to receive sentences as input and give polarities as output. Some of the approaches considered in this paper, shown in Table II, are complex dictionaries built with great effort. However, a lexicon alone has no natural ability to infer polarity in sentence level tasks. The purpose of a lexicon goes beyond the detection of polarity of a sentence [Feldman 2013; Liu 2012], but it can also be used to that end [Godbole et al. 2007; Kouloumpis et al. 2011].\nSeveral existing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods like Vader [Hutto and Gilbert 2014] and SO-CAL [Taboada et al. 2011], combine a Lexicon and the processing of the sentence char-\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nacteristics to determine a sentence polarity. These approaches make use of a series of intensifiers, punctuation transformation, emoticons, and many other heuristics.\nThus, to evaluate each lexicon dictionaries as the base for a sentence-level sentiment analysis method, we considered the Vader’s implementation. In other words, we used Vader’s code for determining if a sentence is positive or not considering different lexicons as dictionaries.\nVader’s heuristics were proposed by means of qualitative analyses of textual properties and characteristics which affect the perceived sentiment intensity of the text. Vader’s author identified five heuristics based on grammatical and syntactical cues to convey changes to sentiment intensity that go beyond the bag-of-words model. The heuristics include treatments for: 1) punctuation (e.g number of ‘!’s); 2) capitalization (e.g ”I HATE YOU” is more intense than ”i hate you”); 3) degree modifiers (e.g ”The service here is extremely good” is more intense than ”The service here is good”); 4) constructive conjunction ”but” to shift the polarity; 5) Tri-gram examination to identify negation (e.g ”The food here isnt really all that great.”). We choose Vader as it is the newest method among those we considered, it is becoming widely used as it was even implemented as part of the well known NLTK python library5.\nWe applied such heuristics with the following lexicons: Emolex, EmoticonsDS, NRC Hashtag, Opinion Lexicon, Panas, Sentiment 140, SentiWordNet. We notice that this strategy drastically improved results of lexicon for sentence-level sentimente analysis in comparison with a simple baseline approach that averages the occurrence of positive and negative words to classify the polarity of a sentence. Table II has also a column Lexicon that describes the number of terms the proposed dictionary contains and column C (changed) indicates some methods we slightly modified to adequate their output formats to the polarity detection task.\nSome other methods required similar adaptations. Methods that are based on machine learning, like SASA and SentiStrength, are used here as unsupervised approaches as their trained models were released by the authors and they have been used in other efforts as tools that require no training data.\nWe plan to release all the codes used in this article, except for paid softwares like LIWC and SentiStrength, as an attempt to allow reproducibility as well as possible corrections in our decisions. There are a few other methods for sentiment detection proposed in the literature and not considered here. Most of them consist of variations of the techniques used by the above methods, such as WordNet-Affect[Valitutti 2004] and ANEW [Bradley and Lang 1999] (the same used by Happiness Index, SentiWordNet, SenticNet, etc.). Finally, there exist a few other methods which are not available on the Web or request and that could not be re-implemented based on their descriptions in the original papers (e.g, Profile of Mood States (POMS) [Bollen et al. 2009]).\nFrom Table II we can also note that the validation strategy, the datasets used, and the baseline comparison of these methods varies greatly, from toy examples to large labeled datasets. Panas-t and Happiness Index use labeled examples to validate their methods, by presenting evaluations of events in which some bias towards positivity and negativity would be expected. Panas-t is tested with unlabeled twitter data related to Michael Jackson’s death and the release of a Harry Potter movie whereas Happiness Index was used to measure song lyrics happiness from 1967 to 2007. Lexical dictionaries were validated in very different ways. AFINN[Nielsen 2011] compared its Lexicon with other dictionaries. Emoticon Distance Supervised [Hannak et al. 2012] used Pearson Correlation between human labeling and the predicted value. SentiWordNet [Esuli and Sebastiani 2006] validates the proposed dictionary with comparisons with other dictionaries, but it also used human validation of the proposed lexicon. These efforts attempt to validate the lexicon created, without comparing the lexicon as a sentiment analysis method itself. Vader [Hutto and Gilbert 2014] compared results with lexical approaches considering labeled datasets from different social media data. SenticNet [Cambria et al. 2010] was compared with SentiStrength [Thelwall 2013] with a specific dataset related to patient opinions, which could not be made available. Stanford Recursive Deep Model [Socher et al. 2013] and SentiStrength [Thelwall 2013] were both compared with standard machine learning approaches, with their own datasets.\n5http://www.nltk.org/ modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010."

The number of annotators used to build the datasets is also shown in Table III.\nTweets DBT was the unique dataset built with a combination of AMT Labeling with Expert validation. They selected 200 random tweets to be classified by experts and compared with AMT results to ensure accurate ratings. We note that the Tweets Semeval dataset was provided as a list of Twitter IDs, due to the Twitter policies related to data sharing. While crawling the respective tweets, a a small part of them could not be accessed, as they were deleted. In any case, we plan to release all gold standard datasets in a request basis, which is in agreement with Twitter policies.\nIn order to assess the extent to which these datasets are trustful, we used a strategy similar to the one used by Tweets DBT. Our goal was not to redo all the performed human evaluation, but simply inspecting a small sample of them to infer the level of agreement with our own evaluation. We randomly select 1% of all sentences to be evaluated by experts (two of the authors) as an attempt to assess if these gold standard data are really trustful. It is important to mention that we do not have access to the instructions provided by the authors. We also could not get access to small amount of the raw data in a few datasets, which was discarded. Finally, our manual inspection unveiled a few sentences in idioms other than English in a few datasets, such as Tweets STA and TED, which were obviously discarded.\nColumn R from Table III exhibits the level of agreement of each dataset in our evaluation. After a close look in the cases we disagree with the evaluations in the Gold standard, we understand that other interpretations could be given to the text, finding cases of sentences with mixed polarity. Some of then are strongly linked to context and very hard to evaluate. Some NYT comments, for instance, are directly related to the news they were inserted to. We can also note that some of the datasets do not contain neutral messages. This might be a characteristic of the data or even a result of how annotators were instructed to label their pieces of text. Most of the cases of disagreement involve neutral messages. Thus, we considered these cases as well as the amount of disagreement we had with the gold standard data as reasonable and expected."

      "heading" : "5.1. Experimental details",
      "text" : "At least three distinct approaches have been proposed to deal with sentiment analysis of sentences. The first of them, splits this task into two steps: (i) identifying sentences with no sentiment, also named as objective vs. neutral sentences and then (ii) detecting polarity (positive or negative), only for the subjective sentences. Another common way to detect sentence polarity is considers in a single task three distinct classes (positive, negative and neutral). Finally, some methods classify a sentence as positive or negative only, assuming that only polarized sentences are present, given the context of a given application. As example, review of products are expected to contain only polarized opinion.\nAiming at providing a more thorough comparison among these distinct approaches, we perform two rounds of tests. In the first we consider the performance of methods to identify 3-classes (positive, negative and neutral). The second considers only positive and negative as output and assumes that a first step of removing the neutral messages was already performed. In the 3-classes experiments we used only datasets containing a considerable number of neutral messages (which excludes Tweets RND II, Amazon and Reviews II that contain an insignificant number of neutral sentences). Despite being 2-classes methods, as highlighted in Table IV, we decided to include LIWC, Emoticons and Senticnet in the 3-classes experiments to present a full set of comparative experiments. LIWC, Emoticons and Senticnet cannot define, for some sentences, their positive or negative polarity, consering it as undefined. It occurs due to the absence in the sentence of emoticons (in the case of Emoticons method) or of twords beloging to the methods’ sentiment lexicon. As a neutral (objective) sentence is one that express no sentiment at all about a topic, we assumed, in the case of these 2-class methods, undefined polarities as being equivalent to neutral ones.\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nThe 2-classes experiments, in turn, were performed with all datasets described in Table III without the neutral sentences. We also included all methods in these experiments, even those that produce neutral outputs. As discussed before, when 2-classes methods cannot detect the polarity (positive or negative) of a sentences they usually assign it to an undefined polarity. As we know all sentences in the 2-classes experiments are positive or negative we create the coverage metric to determine the percentage of sentences a method can in fact classify as positive or negative. For instance, suppose that Emoticons’ method can classify only 10% of the sentences in a dataset, corresponsing to the actual percentage of sentences with emoticons. It means that the coverage of this method in this specific dataset is 10%. Note that, the coverage is quite an important metric for a more complete evaluation in the 2-classes experiments. Even though Emoticons presents high accuracy for the classified phrases it was not able to make a prediction for 90% of the sentences. More formally, coverage is calculated as the number of total sentences minus the number of undefined sentences, all of this divided by the total of sentences, where the number of undefined sentences includes neutral outputs for 3-classes methods.\nCoverage = #Sentences−#Undefined\n#Sentences"

      "heading" : "5.2. Comparison Metrics",
      "text" : "Considering the 3-classes comparison experiments, we used the traditional Precision, Recall and F1 measures for the automated classification.\nPredicted Positive Neutral Negative\nPositive a b c Actual Neutral d e f\nNegative g h i\nEach letter in the above table represents the number of instances which are actually in class X and predicted in class Y, where X;Y ∈ positive; neutral; negative. The recall (R) of a class X is the ratio of the number of elements correctly classified as X to the number of known elements in class X . Precision (P) of a class X is the ratio of the number of elements classified correctly as X to the total predicted as the class X . For example, the precision of the negative class is computed as: P (neg) = i/(c+f + i); its recall, as:R(neg) = i/(g+h+ i); and the F1 measure is the harmonic mean between both precision and recall. In this case, F1(neg) = 2P (neg)·R(neg)P (neg)+R(neg) .\nWe also compute the overall accuracy as: A = a+e+ia+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i . It considers equally important the correct classification of each sentence, independently of the class, and basically measures the capability of the method to predict the correct output. A variation of F1, namely, macro-F1, is normally reported to evaluate classification effectiveness on skewed datasets. Macro-F1 values are computed by first calculating F1 values for each class in isolation, as exemplified above for negative, and then averaging over all classes. Macro-F1 considers equally important the effectiveness in each class, independently of the relative size of the class. Thus, accuracy and Macro-F1 provide complementary assessments of the classification effectiveness. Macro-F1 is especially important when the class distribution is very skewed, to verify the capability of the method to perform well in the smaller classes.\nThe described metrics can easily computed for the 2-classes experiments by just removing neutral columns and rows as per below. In this case, the precision of positive class is computed as: P (pos) = a/(a+ c); its recall as: R(pos) = a/(a+ b); while its F1 is F1(pos) = 2P (pos)·R(pos)P (pos)+R(pos)\nAs we have a large number of combination among base methods, metrics and datasets, a global analysis of the performance of all these combinations is not an easy task. We propose a simple but\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nPredicted Positive Negative\nPositive a b Actual Negative c d\ninformative measure to assess the overall performance ranking. The Mean Ranking is basically the sum of ranks obtained by a method in each dataset divided by the total number of datasets, as per below:\nMR =\nnd∑ j=1 ri\nnd\nwhere nd is the number of datasets and ri is the rank of the method for dataset i.It is important to notice that rank was calculated based on Macro F1.\nThe last evaluation metric we exploit is the Friedman’s Test [Berenson et al. 2014]. It allows to verify whether, in a specific experiment, the observed values are globally similar. In other words, are the methods presenting similar performance across different datasets? To exemplify the application of this test, suppose that n restaurants are each rated by k judges. The question that arises is: are the judges ratings consistent with each other or are they following completely different patterns? The application in our context is very similar: the datasets as the restaurants and the macro-F1 achieved by a method is the rating from the judges.\nThe Friedman’s Test is applied to rankings. Then, to proceed with this statistical test, we sort the methods for each dataset using for comparison the macro-F1 metric. In other words, the method with highest macro-F1 received rank ‘1’ while the slowest macro-F1 method was ranked as ‘21’ for each dataset.\nMore formally, the Friedman’s rank test is defined as:\nFR = ( 12\nrc(c+ 1) c∑ j=1 R2j )− 3r(c+ 1)\nwhere R2j = square of the total of the ranks for group j (j = 1,2,..., c) r = number of blocks c = number of groups\nIn our case, the number of blockes corresponds to the number of datasets and the number of the number of groups is the number of methods evaluated. As the number of blocks increases, the statistical test can be aproximated by using the chi-square distribution with c−1 degrees of freedom. Then, if the FR computed value is greater than the critical value for the chi-square distribution the null hypothesis is rejected. This null hypothesis states that ranks obtained by judges are globally similar, then rejecting the null hypothesis means that there are significant differences in the judgment ranks (datasets). It is important to note that, in general, the critical value is obtained with significance level α = 0.05 and. Synthesizing, the null hypothesis should be rejected if FR > X2α, where X 2 α is the critical value verified in the chi-square distribution table with c − 1 degrees of freedom and α equals 0.05."

This method showed to be biased towards positivity due to the larger amount of positivity in the data they used to build the lexicon. The overall poor performance of this specific method is credited to its lack of treatment of neutral messages and the focus on Twitter messages.\nAs it can been seen in Table VI, the top seven methods based on Macro-F1 are SentiStrength, Semantria, AFINN, OpinionLexicon, Umigon, Vader and SO-CAL. This means that these methods produce good results across several datasets in both, 2 and 3-class tasks. These methods would be preferable in situations in which any sort of preliminary evaluation would be performed. We also note those methods usually perform better in the datasets in which they were originally validated, which is somewhat expected due to fine tuning procedures. This is specially true for SentiStrength and VADER. To understand the impact of such factor, we calculated Mean Rank for these methods without their ‘original’ datasets and put(results in parenthesis). Note that in some cases the rank order changes towards a lower value.\nTable VII presents Friedman’s test results and, as expected, we can conclude that there are significant differences in the mean ratings observed for the methods across all datasets. It statistically indicates that in terms of accuracy and Macro-F1 there is no single method that always achieves the best prediction performance for different datasets, which is similar to the well-known “no-free lunch theorem” [Wolpert and Macready 1997]. This suggests that at least a preliminary investigation should be performed when sentiment analysis is used in a new dataset in order to guarantee a reasonable prediction performance.\nACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems, Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 39, Publication date: March 2010.\nIn order to verify whether this behavior also occurs in specific contexts such as tweets or comments we divided all datasets in three contexts and perform the Friedman’s test for each one. The contexts are Social Networks, Comments and Reviews and the datasets were grouped as presented below. In spite of being sentences extracted from forums we defined the RW dataset as belonging to the Comments context as the properties of sentences in this dataset are similar to those of other Comments datasets, as seen in Table (table III).\nContext Groups\nSocial Networks Myspace, Tweets DBT, Tweets DBT, Tweets RND I, Tweets RND II,\nTweets RND III, Tweets RND IV, Tweets STF, Tweets SAN, Tweets Semeval\nComments Comments BBC, Comments DIGG, Comments NYT,Comments TED, Comments YTB, RW Reviews Reviews I, Reviews I, Amazon\nEven after grouping the datasets in such contexts, we still find out that there are significant differences in the observed ranks across the datasets. Although the values obtained for each context were quite smaller than Friedman’ global value, they are still above the critical value. Table VIII presents the results of Friedman’s test for the individual contexts in both experiments, 2 and 3-class. Recall that for the 3-class experiments, datasets with no neutral sentences or with an unrepresentative number of neutral sentences were not removed. For this reason, the results for 3-class experiments in the Reviews context has no values as none of the Review datasets has a significant number of neutral sentences."

    "abstractText" : "In the last few years thousands of scientific papers have explored sentiment analysis, several startups that measures opinions on real data have emerged, and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Thus, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This study aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty one popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of twenty labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies widely across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods’ codes and datasets used in this paper and we deploy a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.
