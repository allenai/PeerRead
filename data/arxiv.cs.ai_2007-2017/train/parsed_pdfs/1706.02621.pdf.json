      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Scheduling is a method by which thread or process are granted access to computer resources. Operating system is responsible for scheduling a process. Scheduling becomes necessary and important task when we have more than one ready to execute job. Scheduling optimize use of resources. Criteria for choosing best scheduling algorithm vary according nature or preferences of task. Five basic features to decide best scheduling algorithm are as follow [1, 2]:\n Utilization of CPU time\n Throughput\n Turnaround Time\n Waiting Time\n Response time\nThis paper considers only average waiting time and average turnaround time for the purpose of performance comparison. The organization of rest of paper is as follow: In section 2, we introduce three scheduling techniques named SJF, Priority scheduling and Fuzzy based priority scheduling. Next section proposes a modified fuzzy based scheduling algorithm and set of fuzzy rules. Section 4 gives results based on some case studies. Here one case study taken from paper presented by Kadhim, Shatha J., and Kasim M. Al-Aubidy in [1]. Finally conclude the result in section 5."

      "heading" : "2. SCHEDULING TECHNIQUES",
      "text" : "Scheduling algorithms [3, 4] can be classified in different categories as per their applications. Like:\nPreemptive/ Non-preemptive Techniques – In case of preemptive scheduling algorithm, scheduler can stop/postpone execution of any task. But in case of non-preemptive algorithms it is not possible till job completion or running job voluntarily give up resources [2, 3].\nStatic /Dynamic priority scheduling – Static priority do not change, but dynamic priority can be modified.\nThis paper considers three scheduling algorithms Shortest Job First, Priority Scheduling and Fuzzy based CPU scheduling.\nShortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling Algorithm: This algorithm schedules jobs according to their execution time, job with lowest execution time scheduled first and job with largest execution time scheduled last. This is a nonpreemptive algorithm. Its variant known as shortest remaining time is preemptive. This algorithm reduces average waiting time. Shortest job first can be effectively used in case of interactive processes that usually follow a pattern of alternating between looking ahead to a command and execution of it. If the execution time of a method is considered a separate \"job\", past behavior will indicate that method to run next, supported based on estimate of its time period [2, 3, 5].\nPriority Scheduling Algorithm: The Operating System decides priority to each method, and therefore the scheduler arranges the processes within the ready queue so as of their priority. Processes with low priority may be interrupted when incoming process has high priority. There is a number of variant of priority scheduling; SJF is also a special case of priority scheduling. This algorithm sometimes face problem of infinite blocking and starvation, this problem can be removed by aging technique [2, 3].\nFuzzy based scheduling: Fuzzy based scheduling algorithm proposed by Kadhim, Shatha J., and Kasim M. Al-Aubidy in [1]. This algorithm takes input both job priority and execution time and decides new priority using some fuzzy rules. This algorithm uses some linguistic variables for priority given by system, new computed priority and execution time. Performance of this algorithm compared with SJF and classical priority scheduling methods [1]."

      "heading" : "3. FUZZY LOGIC",
      "text" : "Fuzzy logic is a style of multi-valued logic. It deals with approximation rather than exactness. In contrast to classical sets (Classical set takes true or false values) fuzzy logic variables (also known as linguistic variable) can have a truth value that ranges in interval between 0 and 1. Fuzzy logic has been prolonged to grasp the concept of fractional truth, where the truth value may range between completely true and completely false. Moreover, when linguistic variables are practiced, these degrees may be determined by specific methods [6].\nIn recent years the application of fuzzy systems in real world issues is increasing due to the actual fact that fuzzy systems will affect linguistic knowledge beside the numerical knowledge. Now a day an outsized range of researchers are shifting towards fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic has shown itself to be a strong design and analysis methodology in control theory, enabling the implementation of advanced knowledgebased control methods for complicated dynamic systems like those rising applications for systems and artificial biology. TA Hiwarkar et al. list a wide range of applications of fuzzy logic in [6]. K.A. Verma in [7] discussed type-1 fuzzy system and origin of type-2 fuzzy systems and theories and application fields of engineering, finance and medical domains. Xia Feng et al. [8] designed scheduler for embedded control system using fuzzy logic based feedback. A priority scheduler has been developed for mobile ad hoc networks by C. Gomathy et al. in [9]. Rajani Kumari et al. discussed air conditioning system with fuzzy logic [10]. A. Saleh proposed a gridscheduling algorithm on fuzzy matchmaking approach [11].\nFuzzy logic based algorithms are getting more popularity now a day as Reza salami et al. developed an efficient task scheduling algorithm for computational grids using NSGA II with fuzzy variance based crossover [12]. In this algorithm two functions are defined to generate two inputs for fuzzy based system. Variance of costs and presence of resource in scheduling are used to specify probability of crossover. It provides better solution in less number of iterations. H. Chuan et al. discussed fuzzy job shop scheduling problem based in interval number theory [13]. S. Mandloi et al. gives new idea based on ant colony optimization with genetic parameter selection for job scheduling in computational grid [14]. Fuzzy based scheduling algorithms implemented in cloud also. C. Yi Chun et al. proposed a fuzzy based dynamic load decision making scheme in cloud computing [15]."

      "heading" : "4. PROPOSED ALGORITHM",
      "text" : "This scheduling deal with some fuzzy rules and these rules are based on assigned priority and execution time. This work is proposed to compute the New Priority (NP) for all tasks using pre priority and execution time with the help of Mamdani type inference [16].\nThis paper use suitable linguistic variables as input and output for compute a crisp value for new priority. Pre Priority (PP) measured as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High. Execution Time (ET) measured as Very Small, Small, Medium, Long and Very Long. New Priority (NP) measured as Very Low, Low, Medium, High and Very High. The proposed scheduling is a collection of linguistic fuzzy rules which describe the relationship between defined input variables (PP and ET) and output (NP).\nTable contains 25 rules which are based on IF THEN statement such as: -\nIF PP is High and ET is Small THEN NP is High\nThese rules compute the crisp value using centroid Defuzzification method of Mamdani inference in MATLAB that represents the NP of each task.\nFor example: - If Priority is 5 and Execution Time is 20 Then New Priority is 3.81\nAfter assigning new priority, execution is start according to assigned priority and arrival time. Firstly find out the entire tasks which have minimum arrival time (0 sec) and execute the task which has higher priority from them till next task will enter in queue. Whenever a new task will enter again check the priority of entered task and execute the higher priority task till next tasks will enter and so on. After entering all tasks in queue execute remaining task as per higher to lower priority.\nALGORITHM 1: Fuzzy based CPU scheduling\n1.) Initialize n processes with their Execution Time, Priority and Arrival Time. 2.) Compute New Priority (NP) using fuzzy rules with the help of Execution Time and Priority. 3.) Apply sorting method on arrival time to arrange in ascending order.\nfor (i=1; i<n; i++) { for (j=1; j<n-i; j++) if (ATnj>ATnj+1) swap\n4.) Compute the frequency of same arrival time and store in x variable.\nz=1, AT = ATni, x=1 for (i=z; a<=n; i++)\nif (ATni == ATni+1) AT = ATni, x=x+1, z=z+1 Else AT1 =AT ni+1, z=z+1\nBreak\n5.) Compare New Priority of all the process which is having arrival time 0 and find Highest Priority (HP).\nHP= NPni for (i=1; i<=x; i++) x is frequency of arrival time 0. if (NPni < NPni+1)\nHP = NPni+1 Execute the process which has Highest Priority.\n6.) Execute this process until new process will not enter in queue.\nfor (i=1; i<AT1-AT; i++) Execute P\n7.) Whenever new process is enter, break execution of this process and then again find highest priority among all\nentered processes.\n8.) After entering all processes in queue apply sorting method on New Priority to arrange in ascending order. 9.) Execute all processes as per assigned priority.\nIt is very clear that the proposed fuzzy based algorithm obtain better result rather than another scheduling algorithm. It reduces the average waiting time and average turnaround time."

There are number of CPU scheduling algorithms available, but it is very difficult task to decide which one is better. This paper discusses the design and implementation of modified fuzzy based CPU scheduling algorithm. This paper present a new set of fuzzy rules. It demonstrates that scheduling done with new priority improves average waiting time and average turnaround time. General Terms Algorithms, CPU scheduling.",
