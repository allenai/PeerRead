      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The technique of face recognition plays an important role in people’s life ranging from commercial to law enforcement applications, such as real-time surveillance, biometric personal identification, and information security[1]. It is one of the most challenging topics in the interface of computer vision and cognitive science. Over past years, extensive research on face recognition has been conducted by many psychophysicists, neuroscientists and engineers. In general views, the definition of face recognition can be formulated as follows. Different faces in a static image can be identified using a database of stored faces. Available collateral information like facial expression may enhance the recognition rate. Generally speaking, if the face images are sufficiently provided, the quality of face recognition will be mainly related to feature extraction and recognition modeling.\nFor feature extraction, more specifically, there are roughly two kinds of popular face features including holistic features and local features. However, the classical methods using holistic features such as Eigenface[2], Fisherface[3] and Randomface are hardly to reveal the essential structures of high-dimensional faces[4]. Therefore, researchers recently prefer local-feature based methods like subspace learning[5] or manifold representation[6]. On one hand, high-dimensional images can be effectively projected into low-dimensional subspace or sub-manifold. On the other hand, compared to holistic-feature based approaches, local-feature based approaches are always less sensitive to variations of illumination, viewpoint and expression, which in turn improves the recognition rate.\nFor recognition modeling, lots of researchers usually evaluate the performance of model by recognition rate instead of computational cost. Recently, Wright and Ma[7] reported their work called the sparse representation based classification (SRC). To be more specific, it can represent the testing image sparsely using training samples via\n-norm minimization, which can be solved by balancing the minimum reconstructed error and the sparsest coefficients. Experimental results showed that the recognition rate of SRC is much higher than that of classical algorithms such as Nearest Neighbor, Nearest Subspace and Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). However, there are three drawbacks behind the SRC. First, SRC is based on the holistic features, which cannot exactly capture the partial deformation of the face images. Second, regularized SRC usually runs slowly for high-dimensional face images. Third, in the presence of occluded face images, Wright et al. introduce an occlusion dictionary to sparsely code the occluded components in face images. However, the computational cost of SRC increase drastically because of large number of elements in the occlusion dictionary. Therefore, the computational cost of SRC limits its application in real-time area, which increasingly attracts researchers’ attention to solve this issue.\nRecently, Yang and Zhang’s work (Gabor-feature based SRC (GSRC)) [8] claimed that if Gabor wavelets[9] can be employed in feature extraction, it is possible to obtain a much more compact occlusion dictionary in the presence of occluded faces, which not only speeds up the computation but also improves the recognition rate. Although the GSRC provides us a good insight about how to reduce the computational cost of SRC in the presence of occluded faces, to our best knowledge, there is still an essence issue to be addressed. Namely, the computational cost of sparse representation is highly related to three aspects including the dimension of face images, the scale of occlusion dictionary and the speed of regularized optimization. Without any occlusion, Gabor wavelets mainly play an important role in local features\nextraction. So the computational cost of SRC can be determined by the dimension of face images and -norm minimization instead of the scale of occlusion dictionary. If we want to reduce computational cost of SRC in a general condition, on the one hand, we should effectively project high-dimensional faces into low-dimensional features. On the other hand, we should find a sparser representation than regularized SRC.\nInspired by these observations, in this paper, we propose a novel method for fast face recognition called ⁄ Regularized Sparse Representation using Hierarchical Feature Selection (HSR). In the feature extraction, we employ hierarchical feature selection because it contributes to the decrease of computational cost in sparse representation that our approach is strongly rooted in. It consists of Gabor wavelets and Extreme Learning Machine Auto-Encoder (ELM-AE)[10] hierarchically. To be more specific, Gabor wavelets could effectively extract local features at multiple scales and orientations[11] forming Gabor-feature based images, which can greatly improve the recognition rate. Moreover, in the presence of occluded faces, we can obtain a compact occlusion dictionary via sparse coding because of redundancies in Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary, thus the scale of global dictionary can be decreased accordingly. In addition, high-dimensional face images can be effectively represented by low-dimensional features via ELM-AE, thus the dimension of global dictionary can be decreased accordingly. So for Gabor-feature based global dictionary, the compression of scale and dimension contributes to the decrease of computational cost in sparse representation. Finally, the Gabor-feature based methods have been applied into face recognition leading to state-of-the-art recognition rate[12]. Also the computational cost of ELM-AE is much less than Principal Component Analysis (PCA) used in SRC. In the recognition modeling, the main difference between our method HSR and SRC is that -norm minimization is replaced by ⁄ -norm minimization[13] because ⁄ -norm minimization can produce sparser representation, which directly decreases the computational cost of sparse representation. Although ⁄ -norm minimization belongs to non-convex optimization problems, it can be easily transformed into a series of weighted -norm minimization, which is convenient for us to solve by existing methods. Moreover,\n⁄ -norm minimization is more robust than -norm minimization, which is more suitable to process occluded face images. In our experiments, the new method has been verified on representative face databases (Extended Yale B, AR and FERET) with different conditions like lighting, pose, expression, and occlusion. In comparison with related work such as SRC[7] and GSRC[8], experimental results demonstrated that our method is slightly complicated in structure, but it shows the great advantage for computational cost. And we also achieve approximate or even better recognition rate. Therefore, our method has a great potential for the application of fast face recognition like real-time surveillance.\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly discuss previous work on ELM and sparse representation based on regularization. In section 3, we describe our new method including hierarchical feature selection and ⁄ regularized sparse representation. In section 4, we report experimental results on SRC, GSRC and our method HSR under representative face databases with different conditions. Also we present discussions on the performance of new method. Finally, in section 5, we show conclusions on our current research and indicate two important directions for future work."

      "text" : "In this section, we briefly introduce the new method called ⁄ Regularized Sparse Representation using Hierarchical Feature Selection (HSR). Our method will tackle with two critical issues in face recognition. First, how can we reduce computational cost of recognition modeling while keeping the recognition rate? Second, how can we ensure the robustness of our method to occluded faces? Our approach roughly consists of feature extraction and recognition modeling, which solves above problems accordingly. And also we provide the convincing reasons for the choice of recognition model and parameters. The structure of HSR is shown in Fig1.\nFor feature extraction, by employing hierarchical feature selection, we can compress the scale and dimension of global dictionary, which directly contributes to the decrease of computational cost in sparse representation that our approach is strongly rooted in. To be more specific, it consists of Gabor wavelets and ELM-AE hierarchically. For Gabor wavelets part, according to theories of visual neuroscience, the mechanism of retina cells in human eyes can be simply simulated by Gabor wavelets, which could effectively extract local features at multiple scales and orientations.

The framework of HSR\nimages can improve recognition rate to some extent. Moreover, for the occluded images, the enormous scale of occlusion dictionary is the principle factor to affect the computational cost of sparse representation. Because of redundancies exist in Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary, the scale of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed. Besides, the Gabor-feature based methods have been applied into face recognition leading to state-of-the-art recognition rate like Liu and Wechsler’s work. For ELM-AE part, we hope to modify the basic ELM to represent input training and testing images meaningfully. Namely, the output weight of ELM-AE is responsible of learning the features from the input data via singular values. According to ELM theory, ELM-AE is a universal approximator that has a strong ability to achieve compressed, sparse, and equal dimension representation. So it is reasonable to believe that images in a higher dimensional input space can be effectively projected into a lower dimensional feature space via ELM-AE. Thus the dimension of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed. Moreover, the computational cost of ELM-AE is much less than that of PCA used in SRC because of its random weights and biases of the hidden nodes.\nFor recognition modeling, more specifically, our approach is strongly rooted in the framework of sparse representation, which has showed its excellent performance on recognition rate especially for occluded faces. The testing image can be sparsely represented by the linear combination of the training samples and our target is to balance the reconstructed error and the sparsest coefficients via different kinds of regularization. In our approach, we choose ⁄ -norm minimization instead of\n-norm minimization used in SRC or another regularized parameters because of two reasons. First, regularization locates between regularization and regularization, so regularization has sparse property and it can be solved easily. Naturally thinking, ⁄ regularization locates between regularization and\nregularization, so we expect that ⁄ regularization has sparser property than\nregularization. Actually, the geometry property of ⁄ and regularization has obviously proved our expectation. Second, Xu’s experiments[13] demonstrated that the performance of sparse representation using ⁄ regularization is stronger than that using other regularization (0<p<1/2 or 1/2<p<1). One might argue that\n⁄ -norm minimization belongs to non-convex optimization problems, which means it is hard to solve. However, we can transform it into a series of weighted -norm minimization, which is convenient for us to solve by existing methods. Moreover,\naccording to Xu’s experiments, ⁄ -norm minimization is more robust than\n-norm minimization, which is more suitable to process occluded faces."

In this section, we will mainly formulate how to represent original image via Gabor wavelets below. Then, in the presence of occluded images, we briefly introduce how to compress the scale of Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary via sparse coding.\nMore specifically, Gabor wavelets[12] usually demonstrate good characteristics of spatial locality and orientation selectivity. Moreover, in the space and frequency domains, they are optimally localized. It can also be defined with the orientation and scale as follows.\n( ) ‖ ‖ ( ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ ⁄ )[\n⁄ ] (11)\nWhere the pixel of an image is ( ), the wave vector is defined as\nwith\n⁄ and ⁄ . is the maximum frequency,\nand is the spacing factor between kernels in the frequency domain. Besides, determines the ratio of the Gaussian window width to wavelength. In most cases, Gabor wavelets have five different scales and eight orientations. As Liu and Wechsler’s work, the real part of Gabor wavelets can be shown in Fig2.(a).\nHere we should also note that when the parameters of Gabor wavelets are as\n, ⁄ , √ , the Gabor wavelets demonstrate the excellent characteristics of spatial frequency, orientation selectivity and spatial locality.\nAccording to above discussion, we can naturally represent high-dimensional images via Gabor wavelets. The Gabor-feature based local representation is equal to the convolution of the input images with each Gabor wavelet. For example, the convolution of image ( ) with a Gabor wavelet is defined as below.\n( ) ( ) ( ) (12)\nGabor wavelets\n(a) (b)\nGabor-feature image\nFig2 (a)The real part of the Gabor wavelets at five scales and eight orientations,\n(b)Gabor-feature based image\nThese convolution results show different scales, localities and orientations corresponding to the Gabor wavelets.

To contain a Gabor-feature based image, we should first normalize all convolution results, and then concatenate them to form an augmented feature vector .\n(\n)\n(13)\nWhere is an image based on Gabor-feature, which not only improves recognition rate but also bears to image local deformation to some degree. can be shown in Fig2.(b).\nTo make a further step, we can derive Gabor-feature based Image Representationin two situations. First, without any occlusion, the linear representation of can be rewritten as . By employing Gabor wavelets, we can derive the Eq(14).\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) (14)\nWhere ( ) [ ( ) ( ) ( )] and ( ) [ ( ) ( )].\nIn the presence of occluded testing image , the Eq(14) should be modified as Ma’s work indicated as Eq(15).\n( ) [ ( ) ( )] [ ] ( ) (15)\nWhere ( ) is the Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary, and is the representation coefficient vector of the input Gabor feature vector ( ) over ( ).\nThe occlusion dictionary in SRC is normally selected as the identity matrix [7], so SRC has a large number of elements in occlusion dictionary, which definitely increases the computational cost of optimization. For example, If the dimension of original images is ( ), then the dimension of occlusion dictionary in SRC is of . By using Gabor wavelets, the occlusion dictionary will be represented into Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary ( ) , which is obviously redundant. So we should compress it from two aspects including\nthe dimension and scale. Now, let’s briefly discuss the scale compression. We hope to compress the scale of Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary because redundancies\nexist in it. For example, suppose ( ) [ ] the original\nGabor-feature based occlusion dictionary, then the scale-compressed occlusion\ndictionary is denoted by [ ] ( ), and we can represent\nby via sparse coding. So our objective function is defined as Eq(16).\n{‖ ‖ ‖ ‖ }\n(16)\nIt is easy to solve this optimization problem by optimizing and alternatively. Therefore, the compression of scale is easily achieved.

We will mainly introduce ELM-AE for high-dimensional images representation below. And then we will briefly verify the performance of ELM-AE.\nFor Auto-Encoder[18], the output data  ̂ is similar to the input data . Some interesting structure can be obtained when constraints are placing on the networks. For example, suppose that the input image is , and the number of the input nodes is , but only hidden nodes, then the network must try to reconstruct -dimension output nodes with the hidden nodes, which is forced to learn a compressed representation a compressed representation of the input. Based on the above concept, the ELM-AE was first proposed by Huang et.al[10], and the main objective of ELM-AE is to represent the input data meaningfully and rapidly. In term of the number of the input nodes and hidden nodes, there are three different representation including compressed representation, sparse representation and equal dimension representation. For face recognition task, we hope to represent input training and testing images by compressed representation. The training structure of ELM-AE can be seen as Fig3.(a).\nTo be more specific, we first modify the basic ELM[15][19] to conduct unsupervised learning ( ), and random weights and biases of the hidden nodes are chosen to be orthogonal because orthogonalization will make the generalization of ELM-AE better.\nThe orthogonal random weight and bias can be calculated by Eq(18).\n(18)\nWhere [ ] is the orthogonal random weight and [ ] is the orthogonal random bias between the input nodes and hidden nodes. Then we calculate the hidden layer output matrix as the original ELM does.\n( ) (19)\nAfter training process, we first hypothesize that the output weights of ELM can be treated as coding parameters of Auto-Encoder, which is responsible of learning the low-dimensional features from the high-dimensional data.

Therefore, Tibshirani introduced the Lasso algorithm ( -norm minimization) to obtain relative sparse coefficients, which is much easier for us to solve because -norm minimization belongs to the convex problem. What’s more, they proved that regularization is equal to regularization on the certain constraint condition.\nHowever, in the practical application, we find that -norm minimization usually cannot produce the sparest solution, so a question is raised that whether we can introduce a new regularized parameter, which provides a sparser solution than regularization. Fortunately, Xu’s experimental results proved that ⁄ regularization can produce sparser representation compared with regularization, which is also proved by their geometry property. From the Fig4, the bound of regularization has\ndifferent shape, and the solution of -norm minimization is equal to the intersection of the bound and the loss function.

The images are normalized to  under various laboratory-controlled lighting conditions. We randomly selected half of the images for training (i.e., images per subject), and the other half for testing. Choosing the training set randomly assures that our results will be independent of any special choice. Fig5 shows some samples from the same object class, and it is obvious that only illumination is added to these images. The dimension of the Gabor-feature based image is (   ) through a set of Gabor wavelets, which includes five different scales and eight orientations. They can capture abundant local features to form Gabor-feature based image, which will take a lot of time to process this high-dimensional image. To compress the feature space, we applied ELM-AE (a part of HSR) and PCA (a part of SRC and GSRC) respectively with the feature dimensions and on the Gabor-feature based images. Then we computed the recognition rate and the computational cost. In addition, the computational cost of sparse representation is equal to the testing time because there is no training process. In our experiments, we set [7] in HSR, GSRC and SRC by our experience. It shows the recognition rates in Fig6.(a) and computational cost in Fig6.(b) of HSR comparing with GSRC and SRC versus the feature dimension. It is turned out that with the increase of feature dimension, the recognition rate becomes higher and the computational cost becomes more. HSR achieves a maximum recognition rate of\n% with D feature space. In contrast, the maximum recognition rate of GSRC is % and SRC is %. The computational cost of SRC and new method is similar, which much less than that of GSRC. According to a specific dimension \uD835\uDC37, the computational cost of compression by PCA is s while ELM-AE is .\nFig5.Samples from the same object of Extended Yale B dataset\n(a) (b)\nFig6. Recognition rates (a) and time (b) by SRC, GSRC and HSR versus feature\ndimension across Extended Yale B database\n2) AR Database: The AR database consists of frontal images from individuals. We chose a subset consisting of male subjects and female subjects. For each subject, images are selected, which includes only illumination changes and expressions. Fig7 shows several samples from the same object class with the variation of expression and illumination. We selected seven images from Session 1 for training and seven images from Session 2 for testing. The images were cropped and converted to gray scale with the size is  . The dimension of the Gabor-feature vector is after a set of Gabor wavelets. Then we continued to reduce the feature space with five dimensions: and .We also set in HSR, GSRC and SRC, like on the Extended Yale B database. it shows the recognition rates in Fig8.(a) and the computational cost in Fig8.(b) of HSR comparing with GSRC and SRC versus the feature dimension. On this database, the maximum recognition rate of HSR, GSRC and SRC are % % and %respectively. The computational cost of HSR is much less than the other two methods on different dimensions. To be more specific, the total computational time of HSR is about % less than that of SRC, and about % less than that of GSRC.\n0 200 400 600 70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\nFeature Dimension\nR e c o g n it io\nn R\na te\n(% )\n0 200 400 600 0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\nFeature Dimension\nT im\ne (s\n)\nSRC GSRC HSR\nSRC GSRC HSR\nFig7.samples from the same object of AR dataset\n(a) (b)\nFig8. Recognition rates (a) and time (b) by SRC, GSRC and HSR versus feature\ndimension across AR database\nOn the whole, the AR database is more challenging than the Extended Yale B database, thus the total recognition rate of the AR database is declining slightly. This is due to the AR database includes subjects, but the training samples (dictionary atoms) are only seven images. With more stringent conditions, different lighting conditions are added into four neutral faces and different expressions are added into three faces per subject for AR database. In contrast, for the Extended Yale B database, the number of each subject is larger, and the scale of global dictionary is bigger. Only illumination variations exist on the images. The above two experiments illustrate the performance of HSR is much better than that of the SRC and GSRC versus feature dimension especially for computational cost.\nFor briefly verifying the compression performance of ELM-AE, we selected PCA as a control group for high-dimensional images representation. Only the computational cost of the compression component was taken into consideration in our experiments. We compared the computational cost of ELM-AE and PCA on the Extended Yale B and the AR database before the process of recognition modeling. The testing sets of the Extended Yale B and the AR are compressed to a certain dimension (405D for the Extended Yale B and 450D for the AR), whose computational costs are list on the follow Table 1.\nTable1 : Comparation on computational cost of ELM-AE and PCA\nDatabases Yale AR\nTime(s) ELM-AE 1.3011 0.4596\nPCA 36.2022 9.8460\nWe also conducted a quantitative experiment using different compression methods (ELM-AE and PCA) and different regularized parameters ( -norm and ⁄ -norm) on two databases (table 2). For one thing, when testing sets are compressed to a certain dimension ( D for the Extended Yale B and D for the AR), we demonstrated that ⁄ -norm minimization is superior to the -norm minimization for computational cost while keeping the approximate recognition rate. For another thing, ELM-AE and PCA are used to compress the Gabor-feature based images in different mechanisms. So under the same regularized parameter, the computational cost of methods using ELM-AE is less.\n0 200 400 600 40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nFeature Dimension\nR e c o g n it io\nn R\na te\n(% )\n0 200 400 600 0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\nFeature Dimension\nT im\ne (s\n)\nSRC GSRC HSR\nSRC GSRC HSR\n(3) FERET pose database: this database includes images from subjects ( images per subject). Among the images, images are the frontal face with illumination and facial expressions and the others are the face variation with different pose angles. The images marked with ‘ba’,’bd’, ‘be’, ‘bf’, ‘bg’, ‘bj’ and ‘bk’ stand for the different illumination, facial expressions and pose angles (Fig9). In our experiments, the images of this database were already cropped to the size of  . In order to examine the robustness of HSR comparing with the other original algorithms, we tested the recognition rates and computational cost with respect to the variable pose angle. Then in the first test, we used images marked with ‘ba’ and ‘bj’ for training, images marked with ‘bk’ for testing. In another four tests, images marked with ‘ba’, ‘bj’ and ‘bk’ were used as training set, and the rest of images were respectively used as testing set. After feature extraction, the dimension was fixed on 350D in above three methods. We set the parameters for HSR and GSRC and for SRC, which will conduct the best results. The results showed a growing trend of the recognition rate with less pose angle variability in Fig10.(a). When the pose angle becomes larger, the recognition rate of HSR is almost 40% higher than the nearest competitor but still poor. Besides, the computational cost of HSR and GSRC is much less than that of SRC in Fig10 (b). The above experiment illustrated the performance of HSR is also much better than that of the SRC and GSRC versus pose angle.\nFig9.

      "text" : "In this section, we also compared the performance of the HSR with SRC, GSRC on a subset of AR dataset, which includes occluded images. The chosen subset consists of images from subjects ( male and female). In this subset, images of unoccluded frontal face with expression and illumination variation were used for training set. Besides, the rest data were split into two separate test sets of equal size. The first test set contains images, on which all the subjects are wearing sunglasses. The second test set also contains images, and all the subjects wear scarves instead. Sunglass occludes about % of the image and scarf occludes about % of the image intuitively (Fig11).\nFig11: samples of occluded faces with sunglasses and scarves on AR database\nThe parameters of HSR and GSRC were set to and SRC used , which will conduct the best results. The images of this dataset were resized to 8360, then the size of global dictionary is  in the original SRC. In the case of the proposed HSR and GSRC, the dimension of Gabor-feature based image is\n  , and then decreases to D by ELM-AE. Meanwhile, the scale of Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary is compressed to by sparse coding. As a result, after hierarchical feature selection, the size of global dictionary is  . Table 3 has shown the experimental results on two testing sets implemented by SRC, GSRC and HSR. Apparently, SRC performs the worst recognition rate and the highest computational cost, in other words, the holistic features used in SRC are not suitable for the occluded images and the scale of global dictionary decides the computational\n-25 -15 0 0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nPose Angle(degree)\nR e c o g n it io\nn R\na te\n(% )\n-25 -15 0 0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nPose Angle(degree)\nT im\ne (s\n)\nSRC GSRC HSR\nSRC GSRC HSR\ncost of sparse representation to some degree. Besides, it is clearly seen that the computational cost of HSR is much less than that of GSRC in two datasets while the recognition rate of HSR is higher than that of GSRC in AR scarves.\nWe quoted the approach in [Wright][7] to partition the whole image into blocks and processed each block independently, assuming the occlusion part is contiguous. In these blocks, some of them are assumed to be completely occluded and some of them may be partially occluded. We calculated the performance of each block using the HSR, which naturally determined the performance of the whole image by voting. In our experiments, the image is divided into (  ) blocks, and rescaled to the size of a small (  for AR database) pixel patch. In each block, After hierarchical feature selection, the dimension of Gabor-feature based image is , and the scale of Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary is fixed on . Thus, the global dictionary in SRC is  , while the global dictionary of HSR and GSRC are  . Table 4 illustrates the recognition rate and computational cost with the partition approach. The HSR with the partition achieves % in the case of sunglasses testing set and % in the case of scarves testing set with the least computational cost.\nFor comparing difference between partitioned and no-partitioned approaches, we have visualized all results from Table3 and Table4 into Fig12 and Fig13.\nFig12. Recognition rates and time of SRC, GSRC and HSR with no partitioning and\npartitioning on the sunglasses testing set\nFig13. Recognition rates and time of SRC, GSRC and HSR with no partitioning and\npartitioning on the scarves testing set\nWe can clearly see that using partitioning method, the recognition rates generally increase while the computational costs generally decrease except for GSRC. We believe that the number of sub-blocks which make wrong classifications is normally less than the number of sub-blocks that are correctly classified, which can ensure the final recognition rate. What’s more, because of partitioning, the dimension and scale of occlusion dictionary are accordingly decreased, which in turn reduce the computational cost of sparse representation."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed a novel method for fast face recognition called ⁄ Regularized Sparse Representation using Hierarchical Feature Selection (HSR). By employing hierarchical feature selection, we can extract the local features from image, which improves recognition rate because local features are less sensitive to the facial variation. More importantly, the global dictionary can be easily compressed in the dimension and scale by hierarchical feature selection, which speeds up the computation of sparse representation. To be more specific, it is feasible to compress the scale of Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary via sparse coding. And high-dimensional images and global dictionary can be rapidly compressed into low-dimensional feature space via ELM-AE. By introducing ⁄ regularized sparse representation, our method can produce sparser representation than regularized SRC, which in turn speeds up the face recognition. Besides, our method can also produce more robust representation than regularized SRC, which is more suitable to identify occluded faces such as AR sunglasses and scarves. We evaluated our method on a variety of face databases. Experimental results have demonstrated the great advantage of our method for computational cost in comparison with SRC and GSRC. Besides, we also achieve approximate or even better recognition rate. Therefore, our method has a great potential for the application of fast face recognition like real-time surveillance. Our future work will focus on two aspects. First, we will extend ELM-AE into Multi-Layer ELM-AE, which may extract more representative features in order to improve the recognition rate. Second, we will optimize the ⁄ regularization algorithm in order to reduce the computational cost further."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we propose a novel method for fast face recognition called ⁄ Regularized Sparse Representation using Hierarchical Feature Selection (HSR). By employing hierarchical feature selection, we can compress the scale and dimension of global dictionary, which directly contributes to the decrease of computational cost in sparse representation that our approach is strongly rooted in. It consists of Gabor wavelets and Extreme Learning Machine Auto-Encoder (ELM-AE) hierarchically. For Gabor wavelets part, local features can be extracted at multiple scales and orientations to form Gabor-feature based image, which in turn improves the recognition rate. Besides, in the presence of occluded face image, the scale of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed accordingly because redundancies exist in Gabor-feature based occlusion dictionary. For ELM-AE part, the dimension of Gabor-feature based global dictionary can be compressed because high-dimensional face images can be rapidly represented by low-dimensional feature. By introducing ⁄ regularization, our approach can produce sparser and more robust representation compared to regularized Sparse Representation based Classification (SRC), which also contributes to the decrease of the computational cost in sparse representation. In comparison with related work such as SRC and Gaborfeature based SRC (GSRC), experimental results on a variety of face databases demonstrate the great advantage of our method for computational cost. Moreover, we also achieve approximate or even better recognition rate.",
