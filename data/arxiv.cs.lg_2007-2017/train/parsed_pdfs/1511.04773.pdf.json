      "text" : "Canonical correlation analysis (CCA, Hotelling, 1936) and its extensions are ubiquitous techniques in scientific research areas for revealing the common sources of variability in multiple views of the same phenomenon, including meteorology (Anderson, 2003), chemometrics (Montanarella et al., 1995), genomics (Witten et al., 2009), computer vision (Kim et al., 2007; Socher & Li, 2010), speech recognition (Rudzicz, 2010; Arora & Livescu, 2013; Wang et al., 2015a), and natural language processing (Vinokourov et al., 2003; Haghighi et al., 2008; Dhillon et al., 2011; Hodosh et al., 2013; Faruqui & Dyer, 2014; Lu et al., 2015a). CCA seeks linear projections of two random vectors (views), such that the resulting low-dimensional vectors are maximally correlated. Given a dataset of N pairs of observations (x1,y1), . . . , (xN ,yN ) of the random variables, where xi ∈ Rdx and yi ∈ Rdy for i = 1, . . . , N , the objective of CCA for L-dimensional projections can be written as1 (see, e.g., Borga, 2001)\nmax U∈Rdx×L,V∈Rdy×L\ntr ( U⊤ΣxyV )\n(1)\ns.t.

To overcome this issue, kernel CCA (KCCA) was proposed indepedently by several researchers (Lai & Fyfe, 2000; Akaho, 2001; Melzer et al., 2001) and has become a common technique in statistics and machine learning (Bach & Jordan, 2002; Hardoon et al., 2004). KCCA extends CCA by mapping the original inputs in both views into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and solving linear CCA in the RKHS. By the representer theorem of RKHS (Schölkopf & Smola, 2001), one can conveniently work with the kernel functions instead of the high-dimensional (possibly infinite-dimensional) RKHS, and the projection mapping is a linear combination of kernel functions evaluated at the training samples. KCCA has been successfully used for cross-modality retrieval (Hardoon et al., 2004; Li & Shawe-Taylor, 2005; Socher & Li, 2010; Hodosh et al., 2013), acoustic feature learning (Arora & Livescu, 2013), computational biology (Yamanishi et al., 2004; Hardoon et al., 2007; Blaschkoa et al., 2011), and statistical independence measurement (Bach & Jordan, 2002; Fukumizu et al., 2007; Lopez-Paz et al., 2013).\nKCCA also has a closed-form solution, via an N × N eigenvalue system (see Sec. 2). However, this solution does not scale up to datasets of more than a few thousand training samples, due to the time complexity of solving the eigenvalue system (O(N3) for a naive solution) and the memory cost of storing the kernel matrices. As a result, various approximation techniques have been developed, most of which are based on low-rank approximations of the kernel matrices. With rank-M approximations of the kernel matrices, the cost of solving approximate KCCA reduces to O(M2N) (see, e.g., Bach & Jordan, 2002; Lopez-Paz et al., 2014). Thus if M ≪ N , the approximation leads to significant computational savings. Typically, ranks of a few hundred to a few thousand are used for the low-rank kernel approximations (Yang et al., 2012; Le et al., 2013; Lopez-Paz et al., 2014). In more challenging real-world applications, however, it is observed that the rank M needed for an approximate kernel method to work well can be quite large, on the order of tens or hundreds of thousands (see Huang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2015b for classification tasks, and Wang et al., 2015a for KCCA). In such scenarios, it then becomes challenging to solve even approximate KCCA.\nIn this paper, we focus on the computational challenges of scaling up approximate kernel CCA using low-rank kernel approximations when both the training set size N and the approximation rank M are large. The particular variant of approximate KCCA we use, called randomized CCA (Lopez-Paz et al., 2014), transforms the original inputs to an M -dimensional feature space using random features (Rahimi & Recht, 2008; 2009) so that inner products in the new feature space approximate the kernel function. This approach thus turns the original KCCA problem into a very high-dimensional linear CCA problem of the form (1). We then make use of a stochastic optimization algorithm, recently proposed for linear CCA and its deep neural network extension deep CCA (Ma et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015c), to reduce the memory requirement for solving the resulting linear CCA problem. This algorithm updates parameters iteratively based on small minibatches of training samples. This approach allows us to run approximate KCCA on an 8−million sample dataset of MNIST digits, and on a speech dataset with 1.4 million training samples and rank (dimensionality of random feature space) M = 100000 on a normal workstation. Using this approach we achieve encouraging results for multi-view learning of acoustic transformations for speech recognition.3\nIn the following sections we review approximate KCCA and random features (Sec. 2), present the stochastic optimization algorithm (Sec. 3), discuss related work (Sec. 4), and demonstrate our algorithm on two tasks (Sec. 5).\n2Alternatively, one could also solve some equivalent M ×M eigenvalue system instead of the SVD of T, at a similar cost.\n3Our MATLAB implementation is available at http://ttic.uchicago.edu/˜wwang5/knoi.html"

      "text" : "In KCCA, we transform the inputs {xi}Ni=1 of view 1 and {yi} N i=1 of view 2 using feature mappings φx and φy associated with some positive semi-definite kernels kx and ky respectively, and then solve the linear CCA problem (1) for the feature-mapped inputs (Lai & Fyfe, 2000; Akaho, 2001; Melzer et al., 2001; Bach & Jordan, 2002; Hardoon et al., 2004). The key property of such kernels is that kx(x,x′) =< φx(x), φx(x′) > (similarly for view 2) Schölkopf & Smola, 2001. Even though the feature-mapped inputs live in possibly infinite-dimensional RKHS, replacing the original inputs (xi,yi) with (φx(xi), φy(yi)) in (1), and using the KKT theorem (Nocedal & Wright, 2006), one can show that the solution has the form U =\n∑N i=1 φx(xi)α ⊤ i and V = ∑N i=1 φy(yi)β ⊤ i where\nαi,βi ∈ R L, i = 1, . . . , N , as a result of the representer theorem (Schölkopf & Smola, 2001). The final KCCA projections can therefore be written as f(x) = ∑N\ni=1 αikx(x,xi) ∈ R L and\ng(y) = ∑N i=1 βiky(y,yi) ∈ R L for view 1 and view 2 respectively.\nDenote by Kx the N ×N kernel matrix for view 1, i.e., (Kx)ij = kx(xi,xj), and similarly denote by Ky the kernel matrix for view 2. Then (1) can be written as a problem in the coefficient matrices A = [α1, . . . ,αN ] ⊤ ∈ RN×L and B = [β1, . . . ,βN ] ⊤ ∈ RN×L. One can show that the optimal coefficients A correspond to the top L eigenvectors of the N ×N matrix (Kx+NrxI)−1Ky(Ky+ NryI)\n−1Kx, and a similar result holds for B (see, e.g., Hardoon et al., 2004). This involves solving an eiaylorgenvalue problem of size N ×N , which is expensive both in memory (storing the kernel matrices) and in time (solving the N ×N eigenvalue systems naively costs O(N3)).\nVarious kernel approximation techniques have been proposed to scale up KCCA, including Cholesky decomposition (Bach & Jordan, 2002), partial Gram-Schmidt (Hardoon et al., 2004), and incremental SVD (Arora & Livescu, 2012). Another widely used approximation technique for kernel matrices is the Nyström method (Williams & Seeger, 2001). In the Nyström method, we select M (random or otherwise) training samples x̃1, . . . , x̃M and construct the M ×M kernel matrix K̃x based on these samples, i.e. (K̃x)ij = kx(x̃i, x̃j). We compute the eigenvalue decomposition K̃x = R̃Λ̃R̃⊤, and then the N × N kernel matrix for the entire training set can be approximated as Kx ≈ CK̃−1x C ⊤ where C contains the columns of Kx corresponding to the selected subset, i.e., Cij = kx(xi, x̃j). This means Kx ≈ (CR̃Λ̃ − 1 2 )(CR̃Λ̃ − 1 2 )⊤, so we can use the M × N matrix (CR̃Λ̃ − 1\n2 )⊤ as the new feature representation for view 1 (similarly for view 2), where inner products between samples approximate kernel similarities. We can extract such features for both views, and apply linear CCA to them to approximate the KCCA solution (Yang et al., 2012; Lopez-Paz et al., 2014). Notice that using the Nyström method has a time complexity (for view 1) of O(M2dx+M3+NMdx+M2N), where the four terms account for the costs of forming K̃x ∈ RM×M , computing the eigenvalue decomposition of K̃x, forming C, and computing CR̃Λ̃ − 1\n2 , respectively, and a space complexity of O(M2) for saving the eigenvalue systems of K̃x and K̃y , which are expensive for large M . Although there have been various sampling/approximation strategies for the Nyström method (Li et al., 2010; Zhang & Kwok, 2009; 2010; Kumar et al., 2012; Gittens & Mahoney, 2013), their constructions are more involved."

      "text" : "We now describe another approximate KCCA formulation that is particularly well-suited to largescale problems.\nIt is known from harmonic analysis that a shift-invariant kernel of the form k(x,x′) = κ(x− x′) is a positive definite kernel if and only if κ(∆) is the Fourier transform of a non-negative measure (this is known as Bochner’s theorem; see Rudin, 1994; Rahimi & Recht, 2008). Thus we can write the kernel function as an expectation over sinusoidal functions over the underlying probability measures and approximate it with sample averages. Taking as a concrete example the Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel k(x,x′) = e−‖x−x ′‖2/2s2 where s is the kernel width, it can be approximated\nas (Lopez-Paz et al., 2014)\nk(x,x′) =\n∫\ne−jw ⊤(x−x′)p(w) dw ≈\n1\nM\nM ∑\ni=1\n2 cos(w⊤i x+ bi) cos(w ⊤ i x ′ + bi),\nwhere p(w) is the multivariate Gaussian distribution N (0, 1s2 I), obtained from the inverse Fourier transform of κ(∆) = e− ‖∆‖2\n2s2 , and bi is drawn from a uniform distribution over [0, 2π]. Approximations for other shift-invariant kernels (Laplacian, Cauchy) can be found in Rahimi & Recht (2008). This approach has been extended to other types of kernels (Kar & Karnick, 2012; Hamid et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2015). A careful quasi-Monte Carlo scheme for sampling from p(w) (Yang et al., 2014), and structured feature transformation for accelerating the computation of w⊤i x (Le et al., 2013), have also been studied.\nLeveraging this result, Rahimi & Recht (2009) propose to first extract M -dimensional random Fourier features for input x as (with slight abuse of notation)\nφ(x) =\n√\n2\nM\n[\ncos(w⊤1 x+ b1), . . . , cos(w ⊤ Mx+ bM )\n]\n∈ RM ,\nso that φ(x)⊤φ(x′) ≈ k(x,x′), and then apply linear methods on these features. The computational advantage of this approach is that it turns nonlinear learning problems into convex linear learning problems, for which empirical risk minimization is much more efficient (e.g, Lu et al., 2015b used the recently proposed stochastic gradient method by Roux et al. 2012 for the task of multinomial logistic regression with random Fourier features). Rahimi & Recht (2009) showed that it allows us to effectively learn nonlinear models and still obtain good learning guarantees.\nLopez-Paz et al. (2014) have recently applied the random feature idea to KCCA, by extracting M - dimensional random Fourier features {(φx(xi), φy(yi))}Ni=1 for both views and solving exactly a linear CCA on the transformed pairs. They also provide an approximation guarantee for this approach (see Theorem 4 of Lopez-Paz et al., 2014). Comparing random features with the Nyström method described previously, when both techniques use rank-M approximations, the cost of computing the solution to (1) is the same and of orderO(M2N). But using random features, we generate the M -dimensional features in a data-independent fashion with a minimal cost O(NMdx) (for view 1), which is negligible compared to that of the Nyström method. Furthermore, random features do not require saving any kernel matrix and the random features can be generated on the fly by saving the random seeds. Although the Nyström approximation can be more accurate at the same rank (Yang et al., 2012), the computational efficiency and smaller memory cost of random features make them more appealing for large-scale problems in practice."

      "heading" : "3 STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION OF APPROXIMATE KCCA",
      "text" : "When the dimensionality M of the random Fourier features is very large, solving the resulting linear CCA problem is still very costly as one needs to save the M ×M matrix T̃ = Σ̃ − 1 2 xx Σ̃xyΣ̃ − 1 2 yy and compute its SVD, where the covariance matrices are now computed on {(φx(xi), φy(yi))}Ni=1 instead of {(xi,yi)}Ni=1. It is thus desirable to develop memory-efficient stochastic optimization algorithms for CCA, where each update of the projection mappings depends only on a small minibatch of b examples, thus reducing the memory cost to O(bM). Notice, however, in contrast to the classification or regression objectives that are more commonly used with random Fourier features (Rahimi & Recht, 2009; Huang et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2015b), the CCA objective (1) can not be written as an unconstrained sum or expectation of losses incurred at each training sample (in fact all training samples are coupled together through the constraints). As a result, stochastic gradient descent, which requires unbiased gradient estimates computed from small minibatches, is not directly applicable here.\nFortunately, Ma et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2015c) have developed stochastic optimization algorithms, referred to as AppGrad (Augmented Approximate Gradient) and NOI (Nonlinear Orthogonal Iterations) respectively, for linear CCA and its deep neural network extension deep CCA (Andrew et al., 2013). Their algorithms are essentially equivalent other than the introduction in (Wang et al., 2015c) of a time constant for smoothing the covariance estimates over time.\nAlgorithm 1 KNOI: Stochastic optimization for approximate KCCA.\nInput: Initialization U ∈ RM×L,V ∈ RM×L, time constant ρ, minibatch size b, learning rate η, momentum µ. ∆U ← 0, ∆V ← 0 Randomly choose a minibatch (Xb0 ,Yb0)\nSxx ← 1\n|b0|\n∑\ni∈b0\n( U⊤φx(xi) ) ( U⊤φx(xi) )⊤ ,\nSyy ← 1\n|b0|\n∑\ni∈b0\n( V⊤φy(yi) ) ( V⊤φy(yi) )⊤\nfor t = 1, 2, . . . , T do Randomly choose a minibatch (Xbt ,Ybt) of size b\nSxx ← ρSxx + (1− ρ) 1 b\n∑\ni∈bt\n( U⊤φx(xi) ) ( U⊤φx(xi) )⊤\nSyy ← ρSyy + (1− ρ) 1 b\n∑\ni∈bt\n( V⊤φy(yi) ) ( V⊤φy(yi) )⊤\nCompute the gradient ∂U of the objective\nmin U\n1\nb\n∑\ni∈bt\n∥ ∥ ∥ U⊤φx(xi)− S − 1 2 yy V ⊤φy(yi) ∥ ∥ ∥\n2\nas ∂U ← 1b ∑ i∈bt φx(xi)\n(\nU⊤φx(xi)− S − 1 2 yy V ⊤φy(yi) )⊤\nCompute the gradient ∂V of the objective\nmin V\n1\nb\n∑\ni∈bt\n∥ ∥ ∥ V⊤φy(yi)− S − 1 2 xx U ⊤φx(xi) ∥ ∥ ∥\n2\nas ∂V ← 1b ∑ i∈bt φy(yi)\n(\nV⊤φy(yi)− S − 1 2 xx U ⊤φx(xi) )⊤\n∆U ← µ∆U − η∂U, ∆V ← µ∆V − η∂V U ← U+∆U, V ← V +∆V\nend for Output: The updated (U,V).\nThe idea originates from the alternating least squares (ALS) formulation of CCA (Golub & Zha, 1995; Lu & Foster, 2014), which computes the SVD of T using orthogonal iterations (a generalization of power iterations to multiple eigenvalues/eigenvectors, Golub & van Loan, 1996) on TT⊤ and T⊤T. Due to the special form of TT⊤ and T⊤T, two least squares problems arise in this iterative approach (see, e.g., Wang et al., 2015c, Section III. A for more details). With this observation, Lu & Foster (2014) solve these least squares problems using randomized PCA (Halko et al., 2011) and a batch gradient algorithm. Ma et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2015c) take a step further and replace the exact solutions to the least squares problems with efficient stochastic gradient descent updates. Although unbiased gradient estimates of these subproblems do not lead to unbiased gradient estimates of the original CCA objective, local convergence results (that the optimum of CCA is a fixed point of AppGrad, and the AppGrad iterate converges linearly to the optimal solution when started in its neighborhood) have been established for AppGrad (Ma et al., 2015). It has also been observed that the stochastic algorithms converge fast to approximate solutions that are on par with the exact solution or solutions by batch-based optimizers.\nWe give our stochastic optimization algorithm for approximate KCCA, named KNOI (Kernel Nonlinear Orthogonal Iterations), in Algorithm 1. Our algorithm is adapted from the NOI algorithm of Wang et al. (2015c), which allows the use of smaller minibatches (through the time constant ρ) than does the AppGrad algorithm of Ma et al. (2015). In each iteration, KNOI adaptively estimates the covariance of the projections of each view (∈ RL) using a convex combination (with ρ ∈ [0, 1)) of the previous estimate and the estimate based on the current minibatch,4 uses them to whiten the targets of the cross-view least squares regression problems, derives gradients from these problems,5 and finally updates the projection matrices (U,V) with momentum. Notice that ρ controls how fast we forget the previous estimate; larger ρ may be necessary for the algorithm to work well if the mini-\n4In practice we also adaptively estimate the mean of the projections and center each minibatch. 5We also use small weight decay regularization (∼ 10−5) for (U,V) in the least squares problems.\nbatch size b is small (e.g., due to memory constraints), in which case the covariance estimates based on the current minibatch are noisier (see discussions in Wang et al., 2015c). Empirically, we find that using momentum µ ∈ [0, 1) helps the algorithm to make rapid progress in the objective with a few passes over the training set, as observed by the deep learning community (Sutskever et al., 2013). Although we have specifically use random Fourier features in Algorithm 1, in principle other low-rank kernel approximations can be used as well.\nIn each iteration of KNOI, the main cost comes from evaluating the random Fourier features and the projections for a minibatch, and computing the gradients. Since we usually look for low-dimensional projections (L is small), it costs little memory and time to compute the covariance estimates Sxx and Syy (of size L × L) and their eigenvalue decompositions (for S − 1 2 xx and S − 1 2 yy ). Overall, KNOI has a memory complexity of O(Mb) (excluding the O(ML) cost for saving U and V in memory) and a time complexity of O(bM(dx + dy + 4L)) per iteration.\nThe (U,V) we obtain from Algorithm 1 do not satisfy the constraints U⊤Σ̃xxU = V⊤Σ̃yyV; one can enforce the constraints via another linear CCA in RL on {(U⊤φx(xi),V⊤φy(yi))}Ni=1, which does not change the canonical correlation between the projections. To evaluate the projection of a view 1 test sample x, we generate the random Fourier features φx(x) using the same random seed for the training set, and compute U⊤φx(x) for it.\nFinally, we comment on the choice of hyperparameters in KNOI. Empirically, we find that larger b tends to give more rapid progress in the training objective, in which case ρ can be set to small values or to 0 as there is sufficient covariance information in a large minibatch (also shown by Ma et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015c). Therefore, we recommend using larger b and ρ = 0 if one can afford the memory cost. For large-scale problems with millions of training examples, we set b to be a small portion of the training set (a few thousands) and enjoy the fast convergence of stochastic training algorithms (Bottou & Bousquet, 2008). In our experiments we initialize (U,V) with values sampled from a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation 0.1, and tune the learning rate η and momentum µ on small grids."

The CCA objective is more challenging due to the constraints, as also pointed out by Arora et al. (2012).\nAvron et al. (2013) propose an algorithm for selecting a subset of training samples that retain the most information for accelerating linear CCA, when there are many more training samples (large N ) than features (small M in our case). While this approach effectively reduces the training set size N , it provides no remedy for the large M scenario we face in approximate KCCA.\nIn terms of online/stochastic CCA, Yger et al. (2012) propose an adaptive CCA algorithm with efficient online updates based on matrix manifolds defined by the constraints (and they use a similar form of adaptive estimates for the covariance matrices). However, the goal of their algorithm is anomaly detection for streaming data with a varying distribution, rather than to perform CCA for a given dataset. Regarding the stochastic CCA algorithms of Ma et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2015c) we use here, an intuitively similar approach is proposed in the context of alternating conditional expectation (Makur et al., 2015).\nAnother related approach is that of Xie et al. (2015), who propose the Doubly Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD) algorithm for approximate kernel machines (including KCCA) based on random Fourier features. KNOI and DSGD are different in several respects. First, the stochastic update rule of DSGD for (U,V) is derived from the Lagrangian of an eigenvalue formulation of CCA and is different from ours, e.g., DSGD does not have any whitening steps while KNOI does. Second, DSGD gradually increases the number of random Fourier features (or cycles through blocks of random Fourier features) and updates the corresponding portions of (U,V) as it sees more training samples. While this potentially further reduces the memory cost of the algorithm, it is not essential as we could also process the random Fourier features in minibatches (blocks) within KNOI."

The dataset consists of 8.1 million 28 × 28 grayscale images of the digits 0-9. We divide each image into the left and right halves and use them as the two views in KCCA, so the input dimensionality is 392 for both views. The dataset is randomly split into training/test sets of size 8M/0.1M. The task is to learn L = 50 dimensional projections using KCCA, and the evaluation criterion is the total canonical correlation achieved on the test set (upperbounded by 50). The same task is used by Xie et al. (2015), although we use a different training/test split.\nAs in Xie et al. (2015), we fix the kernel widths using the “median” trick6 for all algorithms. We vary the rank M for FKCCA and NKCCA from 256 to 6000. For comparison, we use the same hyperparamters as those of Xie et al. (2015)7: data minibatch size b = 1024, feature minibatch size 2048, total number of random Fourier features M = 20480,8 and a decaying step size schedule. For KNOI, we tune hyperparameters on a rough grid based on total canonical correlation obtained on a random subset of the training set with 0.1M samples, and set the minibatch size b = 2500, time constant ρ = 0, learning rate η = 0.01, and momentum µ = 0.995.

We run each algorithm 5 times using different random seeds and report the mean results.\nThe total canonical correlations achieved by each algorithm on the test set, together with the run times measured on a workstation with 6 3.6GHz CPUs and 64G main memory, are reported in Table 1. As expected, all algorithms improve monotonically as M is increased. FKCCA and NKCCA achieve competitive results with a reasonably large M , with NKCCA consistently outperforming FKCCA at the cost of longer run times. KNOI outperforms the other iterative algorithm DSGD, and overall achieves the highest canonical correlation with a larger M . We show the learning curve of KNOI with M = 40960 (on the test set) in Figure 1. We can see that KNOI achieves steep improvement in the objective in the beginning, and already outperforms the exact solutions of FKCCA and NKCCA with M = 4096 after seeing only 1/4 to 1/2 of the training set. We also run KNOI on an NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU with 12G memory, and report the run times in parentheses in Table 1; the GPU provides a speedup of more than 12 times.

(2015), kernel widths are estimated from the median of pairwise distances between 4000 randomly selected training samples.\n7We thank the authors for providing their MATLAB implementation of DSGD. 8Xie et al. (2015) used a version of random Fourier features with both cos and sin functions, so the number\nof learnable parameters (in U and V) of DSGD is twice that of KNOI for the same M .\ncorpus (Westbury, 1994) of simultaneously recorded speech and articulatory measurements from 47 American English speakers. It has previously been shown that multi-view feature learning via CCA/KCCA greatly improves phonetic recognition performance given audio input alone (Arora & Livescu, 2013; Wang et al., 2015a;b).\nWe follow the setup of Wang et al. (2015a;b) and use the learned features (KCCA projections) for speaker-independent phonetic recognition.9 The two input views are acoustic features (39D features consisting of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and their first and second derivatives) and articulatory features (horizontal/vertical displacement of 8 pellets attached to several parts of the vocal tract) concatenated over a 7-frame window around each frame, giving 273D acoustic inputs and 112D articulatory inputs for each view. The XRMB speakers are split into disjoint sets of 35/8/2/2\n9Unlike Wang et al. (2015a;b), who used the HTK toolkit (Young et al., 1999), we use the Kaldi speech recognition toolkit (Povey et al., 2011) for feature extraction and recognition with hidden Markov models. Our results therefore don’t match those in Wang et al. (2015a;b) for the same types of features, but the relative merits of different types of features are consistent.\nspeakers for feature learning/recognizer training/tuning/testing. The 35 speakers for feature learning are fixed; the remaining 12 are used in a 6-fold experiment (recognizer training on 8 speakers, tuning on 2 speakers, and testing on the remaining 2 speakers). Each speaker has roughly 50K frames, giving 1.43M training frames for KCCA training. We remove the per-speaker mean and variance of the articulatory measurements for each training speaker. All of the learned feature types are used in a “tandem” speech recognition approach (Hermansky et al., 2000), i.e., they are appended to the original 39D features and used in a standard hidden Markov model (HMM)-based recognizer with Gaussian mixture observation distributions.\nFor each fold, we select the hyperparameters based on recognition accuracy on the tuning set. For each algorithm, the feature dimensionality L is tuned over {30, 50, 70}, and the kernel widths for each view are tuned by grid search. We initially set M = 5000 for FKCCA/NKCCA, and also test FKCCA at M = 30000 (the largest M at which we could afford to obtain an exact SVD solution on a workstation with 64G main memory) with kernel widths tuned at M = 5000; we could not obtain results for NKCCA with M = 30000 in 48 hours. For KNOI, we set M = 100000 and tune the optimization parameters on a rough grid. The tuned KNOI uses minibatch size b = 2500, time constant ρ = 0, fixed learning rate η = 0.01, and momentum µ = 0.995. For this combination of b and M , we are able to run the algorithm on a Tesla K40 GPU (with 12G memory), and each epoch (one pass over the 1.43M training samples) takes only 7.3 minutes. We run KNOI for 5 epochs and use the resulting acoustic view projection for recognition. We have also tried to run KNOI for 10 epochs and the recognition performance does not change, even though the total canonical correlation keeps improving on both training and tuning sets.\nFor comparison, we report the performance of a baseline recognizer that uses only the original MFCC features, and the performance of deep CCA (DCCA) as described in Wang et al. (2015b), which uses 3 hidden layers of 1500ReLU units followed by a linear output layer in the acoustic view, and only a linear output layer in the articulatory view. With this architecture, each epoch of DCCA takes about 8 minutes on a Tesla K40 GPU, on par with KNOI. Note that this DCCA architecture was tuned carefully for low PER rather than high canonical correlation. This architecture produces a total correlation of about 25 (out of a maximum of L = 70) on tuning data, while KNOI achieves 46.7. DCCA using deeper nonlinear networks for the second view can achieve even better total canonical correlation, but its PER performance then becomes significantly worse.\nPhone error rates (PERs) obtained by different algorithms are given in Table 2, where smaller PER indicates better recognition performance. It is clear that all CCA-based features significantly improve over the baseline. Also, a large M is necessary for KCCA to be competitive with deep neural network methods, which is consistent with the findings of Huang et al. (2014); Lu et al. (2015b) when using random Fourier features for speech data (where the task is frame classification). Overall, KNOI outperforms the other approximate KCCA algorithms, although DCCA is still the best performer."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We have proposed kernel nonlinear orthogonal iterations (KNOI), a memory-efficient approximate KCCA algorithm based on random Fourier features and stochastic training of linear CCA. It scales\nbetter to large data and outperforms previous approximate KCCA algorithms in both the objective values (total canonical correlation) and running times (with GPU support).\nIt is straightforward to incorporate in our algorithm the faster random features of Le et al. (2013) which can be generated (for view 1) in time O(NM log dx) instead of O(NMdx), or the Taylor features of Cotter et al. (2011) which is preferable for sparse inputs, and random features for dot product or polynomial kernels (Kar & Karnick, 2012; Hamid et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2015), which have proven to be useful for different domains. It is also worth exploring parallelization and multiple kernel learning strategies of Lu et al. (2015b) with random Fourier features to further bridge the gap between kernel methods and deep neural network methods.\nFinally, as noted before, our algorithm does not use unbiased estimates of the gradient of the CCA objective. However, unbiased gradient estimates are not necessary for convergence of stochastic algorithms in general; a prominent example is the popular Oja’s rule for stochastic PCA (see discussions in Balsubramani et al., 2013; Shamir, 2015). Deriving global convergence properties for our algorithm is a challenging topic and the subject of ongoing work."

Although there is a closed-form solution for the KCCA objective, it involves solving an N × N eigenvalue system where N is the training set size, making its computational requirements in both memory and time prohibitive for large-scale problems. Various approximation techniques have been developed for KCCA. A commonly used approach is to first transform the original inputs to an M -dimensional random feature space so that inner products in the feature space approximate kernel evaluations, and then apply linear CCA to the transformed inputs. In many applications, however, the dimensionality M of the random feature space may need to be very large in order to obtain a sufficiently good approximation; it then becomes challenging to perform the linear CCA step on the resulting very high-dimensional data matrices. We show how to use a stochastic optimization algorithm, recently proposed for linear CCA and its neuralnetwork extension, to further alleviate the computation requirements of approximate KCCA. This approach allows us to run approximate KCCA on a speech dataset with 1.4 million training samples and a random feature space of dimensionality M = 100000 on a typical workstation.",
