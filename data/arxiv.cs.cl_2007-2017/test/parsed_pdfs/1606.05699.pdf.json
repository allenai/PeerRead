      "text" : "Social media sites on the Internet provide increasingly more, and increasingly popular, means for people to voice their opinions on trending events. Traditional news media — the New York Times and CNN, for example — now provide online mechanisms that allow and encourage readers to share reactions, opinions, and personal experiences relevant to a news story. For complex emerging events, in particular, user comments can provide relevant, interesting and insightful information beyond the facts reported in the news. But their large volume and tremendous variation in quality make it impossible\nfor readers to efficiently digest the user-generated content, much less integrate it with reported facts from the dozens or hundreds of news reports produced on the event each day.\nIn this work, we present a socially-informed timeline generation system that jointly generates a news article summary and a user comment summary for each day of an ongoing complex event. A sample (gold standard) timeline snippet for Ukraine Crisis is shown in Figure 1. The event timeline is on the left; the comment summary for March 17th is on the right.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n05 69\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 Ju\nn 20\nWhile generating timelines from news articles and summarizing user comments have been studied as separate problems (Yan et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2012), their joint summarization for timeline generation raises new challenges. Firstly, there should be a tight connection between the article and comment portion of the timeline. By definition, users comment on socially relevant events. So the important part of articles and insightful comments should both cover these events. Moreover, good reading experience requires that the article summary and comment summary demonstrate evident connectivity. For example, Comment C in Figure 1 (“Sanctions are effective and if done in unison with the EU”) is obscure without knowing the context that “sanctions are imposed by U.S”. Simply combining the outputs from a timeline generation system and a comment summarization system may lead to timelines that lack cohesion. On the other hand, articles and comments are from intrinsically different genres of text: articles emphasize facts and are written in a professional style; comments reflect opinions in a less formal way. Thus, it could be difficult to recognize the connections between articles and comments. Finally, it is also challenging to enforce continuity in timelines with many entities and events.\nTo address the challenges mentioned above, we formulate the timeline generation task as an optimization problem, where we maximize topic cohesion between the article and comment summaries while preserving their ability to reflect important concepts and subevents, adequate coverage of mentioned topics, and continuity of the timeline as it is updated with new material each day. We design a novel alternating optimizing algorithm that allows the generation of a high quality article summary and comment summary via mutual reinforcement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on four disparate complex event datasets collected over months from the New York Times, CNN, and BBC. Automatic evaluation using ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) and gold standard timelines indicates that our system can effectively leverage user comments to outperform state-of-the-art approaches on timeline generation. In a human evaluation via Amazon Mechanical Turk, the comment summaries generated by our method were selected as the best in terms of informativeness and insightfulness in 66.7% and\n51.7% of the evaluations (vs. 26.7% and 30.0% for randomly selected editor’s-picks).\nEspecially, our optimization framework relies on two scoring functions that estimate the importance of including individual article sentences and user comments in the timeline. Based on the observation that entities or events frequently discussed in the user comments can help with identify summaryworthy content, we show that the scoring functions can be learned jointly by utilizing graph-based regularization. Experiments show that our joint learning model outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms and other joint learning based methods when evaluated on sentence ranking and comment ranking. For example, we achieve an NDCG@3 of 0.88 on the Ukraine crisis dataset, compared to 0.77 from Yang et al. (2011) which also conducts joint learning between articles and social context using factor graphs.\nFinally, to encourage continuity in the generated timeline, we propose an entity-centered event threading algorithm. Human evaluation demonstrates that users who read timelines with event threads write more informative answers than users who do not see the threads while answering the same questions. This implies that our system constructed threads can help users better navigate the timelines and collect relevant information in a short time.\nFor the rest of the paper, we first describe data collection (Section 2). We then introduce the joint learning model for importance prediction (Section 3). The full timeline generation system is presented in Section 4, which is followed by evaluations (Section 5). Related work and conclusion are in Sections 6 and 7."

For each event, we select a set of key words (usually entities’ name), which are used to filter out irrelevant articles. We collect comments for NYT articles through NYT community API, and comments for CNN articles via Disqus\nAPI. 1 NYT comments come with information on whether a comment is an editor’s-pick. The statistics on the four datasets are displayed in Table 1.2\nWe extract parse trees, dependency trees, and coreference resolution results of articles and comments with Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014).

      "heading" : "3 Joint Learning for Importance Scoring",
      "text" : "We first introduce a joint learning method that uses graph-based regularization to simultaneously learn two functions — a SENTENCE scorer and a COMMENT scorer — that predict the importance of including an individual news article sentence or a particular user comment in the timeline.\nWe train the model on the aforementioned NYT2013 dataset, where 20% of the articles and their comments are reserved for parameter tuning. Formally, the training data consists of a set of articles D = {di}|D|−1i=0 . Each article di contains a set of sentences xsdi = {xsdi ,j} |sdi |−1 j=0 and a set of associated comments xcdi = {xcdi ,k} |cdi |−1 k=0 , where |sdi | and |cdi | are the numbers of sentences and comments for di. For simplicity, we use xs or xc to denote a sentence or a comment wherever there is no ambiguity.\nIn addition, each article has a human-written abstract. We use the ROUGE-2 (Lin and Hovy, 2003) score of each sentence computed against the associated abstract as its gold-standard importance score.\n1BBC comment volume is low, so we do not collect it. 2The datasets are available at http://www.cs.\ncornell.edu/˜luwang/data.html.\nEach comment is assigned a gold-standard value of 1.0 if it is an editor’s pick, or 0.0 otherwise.\nThe SENTENCE and COMMENT scorers rely on two classifiers, each designed to handle the special characteristics of news and user comments, respectively; and a graph-based regularizing constraint that encourages similarity between selected sentences and comments. We describe each component below.\nArticle SENTENCE Importance. Each sentence xs in a news article is represented as a k-dimensional feature vector xs ∈ Rk, with a gold-standard label ys. We denote the training set as a feature matrix X̃s, with a label vector Ỹs. To produce the SENTENCE scoring function fs(xs) = xs · ws, we use ridge regression to learn a vector ws that minimizes ||X̃sws − Ỹs||22 + βs · ||ws||22. Features used in the model are listed in Table 2. We also impose the following position-based regularizing constraint to encode the fact that the first sentence in a news article usually conveys the most essential information: λs · ∑ di ∑ xsdi ,j\n,j 6=0 ||(xsdi ,0 − xsdi ,j) ·ws − (ysdi ,0 − ysdi ,j)|| 2 2 , where xsdi ,j is the j-th sentence in document di. Term (xsdi ,0 − xsdi ,j) · ws measures the difference in predicted scores between the first sentence and any other sentence. This value is expected be close to the true difference. We further construct X̃′s to contain all difference vectors (xsdi ,0 − xsdi ,j), with Ỹ′s as label difference vector. The objective function to minimize becomes\nJs(ws) = ||X̃sws − Ỹs||22 + λs · ||X̃′sws − Ỹ′s||22 + βs · ||ws||22 (1)\nUser COMMENT Importance. Similarly, each comment xc is represented as an l−dimensional feature vector xc ∈ Rl, with label yc. Comments in the training data are denoted with a feature matrix X̃c with a label vector Ỹc. Likewise, we learn fc(xc) = xc ·wc by minimizing ||X̃cwc − Ỹc||22 + βc · ||wc||22. Features are listed in Table 3. We apply a pairwise preference-based regularizing constraint (Joachims, 2002) to incorporate a bias toward editor’s picks: λc · ∑ di ∑ xcdi ,j ∈Edi ,xcdi ,k /∈Edi ||(xcdi ,j−xcdi ,k) ·wc− 1||22 , where Edi are the editor’s picks for di. Term (xcdi ,j − xcdi ,k) · wc enforces the separation of editor’s picks from regular comments. We further construct X̃′c to contain all the pairwise differences\n(xcdi ,j − xcdi ,k). Ỹ ′ c is a vector of same size as X̃′c with each element as 1. Thus, the objective function to minimize is:\nJc(wc) = ||X̃cwc − Ỹc||22 + λc · ||X̃′cwc − Ỹ′c||22 + βc · ||wc||22 (2)\nGraph-Based Regularization. The regularizing constraint is based on two mutually reinforcing hypotheses: (1) the importance of a sentence depends partially on the availability of sufficient insightful comments that touch on topics in the sentence; (2) the importance of a comment depends partially on whether it addresses notable events reported in the sentences. For example, we want our model to bias ws to predict a high score for a sentence with high similarity to numerous insightful comments.\nWe first create a bipartite graph from sentences and comments on the same articles, where edge weights are based on the content similarity between a sentence and a comment (TF-IDF similarity is used). Let R̃ be an N ×M adjacency matrix, where N and M are the numbers of sentences and comments. Rsc is the similarity between sentence xs and comment xc. We normalize R̃ by Q̃ = D̃− 1 2 R̃D̃′\n− 12 , where D̃ and D̃′ are diagonal matrices: D̃ ∈ RN×N , Di,i = ∑M j=1Ri,j ; D̃ ′ ∈ RM×M , D′j,j = ∑N i=1Ri,j . The interplay between the two types of data is encoded in the following regularizing constraint:\nJs,c(ws,wc) = λsc · ∑ di ∑ xs∈xsdi ,xc∈xcdi Qxs,xc · (xs ·ws − xc ·wc)2\n(3)\nFull Objective Function. Thus, the full objective function consists of the three parts discussed above:\nJ(ws,wc) = Js(ws) + Jc(wc) + Js,c(ws,wc) (4)\nFurthermore, using the following notation,\nX̃ =\n[ X̃s 0\n0 X̃c\n] Ỹ = [ Ỹs Ỹc ] X̃′ = [ X̃′s 0 0 X̃′c ] Ỹ′ = [ Ỹ′s Ỹ′c ]\nβ̃ = [ βsIk 0 0 βcIl ] λ̃ = [ λsI|X′s| 0\n0 λcI|X′c|\n]\nL̃ = [ λscI|Xs| −λscQ̃ −λscQ̃T λscI|Xc| ] w = [ ws wc ]\nwe can show a closed form solution to Equation 4 as follows:\nŵ =\n(X̃TL̃X̃ + X̃TX̃ + X̃′Tλ̃X̃′ + β̃)−1(X̃TỸ + X̃′Tλ̃Ỹ′)\n(5)"

It then identifies a subset S ⊆ Vs as the article summary and a subset C ⊆ Vc as the comment summary by maximizing the following function:\nZ(S,C; T ) = Squal(S; T )+Cqual(C)+δX (S,C) (6)\nwhere Squal(S; T ) measures the quality of the article summary S in the context of the historical timeline represented as event threads T ; Cqual(C) computes the quality of the comment summary C; and X (S,C) estimates the connectivity between S and C.\nWe solve this maximization problem using an alternating optimization algorithm which is outlined\nin Section 4.4. In general, we alternately search for a better article summary S with hill climbing search and a better comment summary C with FordFulkerson algorithm until convergence.\nIn the rest of this section, we first describe an entity-centered event threading algorithm to construct event threads T which are used to boost article timeline continuity.

For instance, the following thread connects events about Obama’s action towards the annexation of Crimea by Russia: Day 1: Obama declared sanctions on Russian officials. Day 2: President Obama warned Russian. Day 3: Obama urges Russian to move back its troops. Day 4: Obama condemns Russian aggression in Ukraine.\nWe first collect relation extractions as (entity, relation, entity) triples from OLLIE (Mausam et al., 2012), a dependency relation based open information extraction system. We retain extractions with confidence scores higher than 0.5. We further design syntactic patterns based on Fader et al. (2011) to identify relations expressed as a combination of a verb and nouns. Each relation contains at least one event-related word (Ritter et al., 2012).\nThe entity-centered event threading algorithm works as follows: on the first day, each sentence in the summary becomes an individual cluster; thereafter, each sentence in the current day’s article summary either gets attached to an existing thread or starts a new thread. The updated threads then become the input to next day’s summary generation process. On day n, we have a set of threads T = {τ : s1, s2, · · · , sn−1} constructed from previous n − 1 days, where si represents the set of sentences attached to thread τ from day i. The cohesion between a new sentence s ∈ S and a thread τ is denoted as cohn(s, τ). s is attached to τ̂ if there exists τ̂ = maxτ∈T cohn(s, τ) and cohn(s, τ̂) > 0.0. Otherwise, s becomes a new thread. We define cohn(s, τ) = minsi∈τ,si 6=∅ tfsimi(si, s), where tfsimi(si, s) measures the TF similarity between si and s.

Squal(S; T ) captures three desired qualities of an article summary: importance (first item), coverage (second item), and the continuity of the current summary to previously generated summaries. The coverage function has been used to encourage summary diversity and reduce redundancy (Lin and Bilmes, 2011; Wang et al., 2014). The continuity function considers how well article summary S can be attached to each event thread, thus favors summaries that can be connected to multiple threads.\nParameters θcov and α are tuned on multidocument summarization dataset DUC 2003 (Over and Yen, 2003). Experiments show that system performance peaks and is stable for θcont ∈ [1.0, 5.0]. We thus fix θcont to 1.0. We discard sentences with more than 80% of content words covered by historical summaries. We use BASIC to denote a system that only optimizes on importance and coverage (i.e. first two items in Squal(S; T )).

Generating tweet+article summaries has been recently investigated in Yang et\nal. (2011). They propose a factor graph to allow sentences and tweets to mutually reinforce each other. Gao et al. (2012) exploit a co-ranking model to identify sentence-tweet pairs with complementary information estimated from a topic model. These efforts handle a small number of documents and tweets, while we target a larger scale of data.\nIn terms of timeline summarization, the Chieu and Lee (2004) system ranks sentences according to “burstiness” and “interestingness” estimated by a likelihood ratio test. Yan et al. (2011) explore an optimization framework that maximizes the relevance, coverage, diversity, and coherence of the timeline. Neither system has leveraged the social context. Our event threading algorithm is also inspired by work on topic detection and tracking (TDT) (Allan et al., 1998), where efforts are made for document-level link detection and topic tracking. Similarly, Nallapati et al. (2004) investigate event threading for articles, where they predict linkage based on causal and temporal dependencies. Shahaf et al.
