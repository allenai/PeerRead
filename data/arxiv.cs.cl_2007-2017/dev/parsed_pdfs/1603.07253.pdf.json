      "text" : "There is some disagreement about what is meant by the terms conceptual knowledge and semantic memory, but most characterizations involve the encoding of beliefs or propositions about concepts (e.g. objects, actions, properties, etc.), the ability to organize those concepts into useful sets, and the relationships within and between sets [16, 18, 20]. From the perspective of the cognitive sciences, distinctions are typically made between the knowledge or memories closely tied to an individual’s personal experiences, and those beliefs generally held in common by many individuals across a society, or many societies. Use of the term conceptual knowledge is\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.\noften biased toward these more universal beliefs and knowledge about concepts.\nConceptual knowledge is studied by several related but distinct communities. In cognitive science, cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computational linguistics, conceptual knowledge is typically studied in the context of discovering how concepts are learned, represented, and applied by humans. In natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval, conceptual knowledge is often studied in the context of automated systems designed to make semantic inferences and retrieve information based on conceptual information. The semantic models that drive these semantic textual similarity (STS) systems are learned from different properties or statistics extracted from text corpora (e.g. Wikipedia) or from the different relationships extracted from structured or taxonomic lexical knowledge databases (e.g. WordNet).\nAcross all of these communities, ground-truths about concepts are necessary for testing theories and evaluating models or systems. These ground-truths can be challenging to generate because the attributes or dimensions of what should be considered part of a ground-truth may be dependent on the particular theory, model, or system being evaluated. One general solution to this problem has been to abstract away from specific attributes in favor of ground-truths about the relationships between concepts [17]. Models can then be evaluated in terms of how well they predict either the semantic distances between concepts [3] or the structures or networks estimated from those distances [19]. These distances or structures can be estimated from behavior-based measures like ratings or response times, corpus metrics, or relationships encoded in knowledge bases.\nA variety of semantic similarity and relatedness data sets have been used for these purposes. Many of the data sets used for NLP and evaluating STS systems are public, including those adopted by the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (Semeval, e.g. [12]). Many of the data sets used in the cognitive sciences, though often reported on in published studies, have not been publicly released.\nHere we present a new data set for evaluating models of conceptual knowledge based on the relatedness between words and sentences. It consists of 25 target concepts (i.e. words) that span several semantic dimensions (objects, actions, settings, roles, states, and events), and parts of speech (nouns, verbs, and adjectives). Each of the 25 target words was paired with 31 simple sentences written and selected to elicit vary-\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n07 25\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nJ an\n2 01\n7\ning degrees of perceived relatedness to the target word, for a total of 775 word-sentence pairings. For example, the 31 sentences paired with the target word family are shown in Table 1.\nSome sentences are clearly related to the concept family, others appear somewhat related or slightly related, and others have no clear or obvious relationship to the target concept. These relationships were tested experimentally using a Maximum Difference Scaling procedure [6], and replicated using a simpler procedure. As a sample application, the resulting ground-truth ratings were compared to the outputs of four commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) STS systems (n-gram, LSA, Google word2vec, and UMBC Ebiquity), and two baseline STS models to help interpret performance levels.\nThis data set was originally generated for use with neural data as part of the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) Knowledge Representation in Neural Systems (KRNS) Program. While results are not reported here, the data set was used to evaluate whether semantic relatedness was encoded in the neural responses evoked by these sentences, as measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imag-\ning. All stimuli and results have been made available in the ancillary files published with this article."

      "text" : "Target concepts. Table 2 lists the 25 target concepts included. Each target concept is restricted to a specific sense or meaning, adapted from WordNet senses for the term [14]. The set of target concepts consists of nouns, verbs and adjectives, and is biased away from abstract or uncommon concepts, and toward vivid, imageable [15], and concrete concepts. The mean concreteness for target concepts is 4.18 on the 5-point scale reported by Brysbaert [2]. Target concepts were selected to span the six semantic dimensions described below.\n1. Objects: things that physically exist. They may be animate or inanimate, natural or artifactual (man-made). Objects will commonly have physical substance, or be detectable by human senses. These often take the form of nouns. Objects may be count nouns or mass nouns. Examples: rabbit, hammer, pear, clock, water.\n2. Actions: things that are done or experienced (felt or sensed), typically by people or other living things. These often take the form of verbs. Actions may involve moving, perceiving, feeling, creating, and so on. Examples: walks, hears, eats, builds, cooks.\n3. Settings: where or when things happen. They may be places, spaces, or times. Indoor or outdoor locations, seasons, and times of day are appropriate. Examples: dining room, plaza, winter, morning.\n4. Roles: what people do or who they are. They include vocations and professions, kinship, and social roles. Examples: athlete, victim, friend, brother, coach, plumber.\n5. States, properties, conditions, and emotions: concepts that typically describe or characterize. They include human emotions, physical properties, conditions, colors, and so on. They may take the form of adjectives. Examples: dry, red, damaged, sad.\n6. Events and activities: things that happen (e.g. human organized or natural events) or activities that are engaged in (e.g. hobbies). Examples: wedding, tornado, parade, tennis match."

      "heading" : "BEHAVIORAL PROCEDURE",
      "text" : "Human judgments were collected via a web-based application to assess the semantic relatedness between target concepts and comparison sentences. First, judgments were collected and analyzed using a Maximum Difference Scaling (MDS) or Best-Worst scaling paradigm [11]. Because MDS sometimes requires very large numbers of responses, we also tested the applicability of a second paradigm, thought to be simpler and less resource-intensive ranking paradigm.\nMDS is a discrete choice technique used to evaluate relative importance or preference by asking participants to choose the best and worst options from a set of presented items. A variant of MDS was used in which three sentences were presented with a target concept on each trial, as shown in Figure 1. Participants were asked to consider the relatedness between the\ntarget concepts and the three sentences, and select the sentence that best relates to the target concept, and the sentence that worst relates to the target concept. While the terms similarity and relatedness are at times used interchangeably, and at other times used to refer to different relationships, the word related was used in all instructions given to participants, and so all results should be interpreted in that context.\nResponses from 155 of these trials were necessary to reconstruct relatedness scores for each of the comparison sentences for a single target concept, and a total of 3875 trials were collected for each participant. Presentation order was randomized across participants, and participants were permitted to log in and out of the application from the remote location of their choice, and complete the trials over as many sessions as necessary over the course of two weeks.\nThe relatedness between a particular target word t and comparison sentence s was computed via counting analysis: the proportion of times each s was selected best for t (i.e. most related) less the proportion of times s was selected worst for t (i.e. least related):\nRelatednesss,t = (st,best − st,worst)/st,total\nIn this way, similarity scores ranged between -1 (not similar) and 1 (very similar), and could be used to rank the sentences from the most related (highest score) to the least related (least related). All further comparisons were done using the mean ranks of the sentences across participants.\nThe very precise scores produced by MDS require large amounts of data collected over many trials. To assess whether this degree of precision was necessary, an alternative paradigm was explored in which participants were presented with all 31 sentences at once (in random order) and asked to rank them in terms of their relatedness to the target concept (from most related to least related) by dragging and dropping them into a list. Participants repeated this free-ranking procedure to produce 25 ranked lists of sentences: one for each of the 25 different target concepts."

All participants were fluent in English, had a high school diploma or equivalent, had normal or corrected to normal vision, and did not have any reading disorders and language impairments, as self-reported. Fifty-five participants (mean age = 24) completed the MDS task for all 25 concepts using a web-based application. The data collected was analyzed for outliers, and eight of the 55 participants produced responses that deviated by more than three standard deviations from group means. These participants were removed from further analysis; 20 of the remaining 47 subjects also completed the free-ranking paradigm."

      "heading" : "STS SYSTEMS",
      "text" : "The relatedness rankings produced by human participants were compared to relatedness rankings produced by four STS models, as well as two baseline text-based models to aid in interpretation. Each of the models listed below were run on the 25 target concept lists, and each produced 25 ranked lists of comparison sentences (just as the participants did). These ranked lists were compared to the behavior-based ranked lists using Spearman’s rank correlation, and mean Spearman values are reported. All analyses were run in Matlab.\n1. N-gram: The basic n-gram model assumes that words that are related in meaning will occur in close proximity to one another [1]. In practice, a matrix of co-occurrence frequencies between pairs of content words was generated, where co-occurrence frequency refers to the frequency with which two words appear within a five-word window of one another in the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) [4]. In this way, co-occurrence frequency was used as a measure of semantic relatedness. More specifically, the matrix of co-occurrence frequencies was constructed as follows: A raw count matrix was generated in which each row and column entry contained a count of the number of times the two indexed words were both found within a five-word window. The counts along the diagonal of the matrix were replaced by the total number of occurrences of the indexed word in the five-word windows that is, each time a word was observed, it was counted as being paired with itself. The columns of the matrix were then normalized by their sums, resulting in a matrix of relative co-occurrence frequencies. Similarity scores between target words and sentences were computed by summing the [target word, sentence word] elements of the matrix for all words in the sentence.\n2. LSA: Latent Semantic Analysis is based on the principle that words that are related in meaning will occur in related texts or documents [5]. Similarity was computed as the cosine distance between entries in the low-rank matrix. Analyses were run both with and without the use of a POS tagger, but POS information did not consistently change performance.\n3. Word2Vec: The Word2Vec system was built by Google using a neural network and a skip-gram model [13]. Skipgram models are trained to predict the surrounding context given a target word. In this way, the similarity between two Word2Vec representations is computed as the cosine distance between vectors, and is associated with the similarity between the local contexts they could appear in based on the model.\n4. UMBC Ebiquity (Ebiquity): The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Ebiquity team provided its STS for inclusion in this comparison. The Ebiquity system fuses corpus-based (i.e. LSA) and knowledge-based (i.e. WordNet) methods to produce semantic similarity scores [9]. To augment the POS-tagged LSA-based semantic similarity, the WordNet database of semantic and lexical relations is used to produce an alternative estimate of similarity based on the distance between two words or concepts in the WordNet taxonomy (e.g. couple and family are similar because they both appear as instances of social groups within the WordNet hierarchy). The corpus-based and knowledge-based similarities are then weighted based on a training process to produce a single similarity score. In this way, the WordNet taxonomy effectively fills in certain gaps in distributional information. Ebiquity is specifically designed to compare words and sentences and compose a meaning for a sentence or phrase from the meanings of its constituent words. The other\nmodels had not been optimized for this task, and so some method for comparing sentences to words had to be adopted. For the vector-based approaches reported here, we adopted similar methods to the LSA component of the Ebiquity system for comparing sentences to words: average the normalized individual word vectors from a comparison sentence, then compute the cosine distance between the target concept vector and the averaged sentence vector to produce a relatedness score between a target concept and a comparison sentence. This method of comparing words to sentences performed best amongst several alternatives tested.\n5. Word-spotting Baseline (WordSpot): The word-spotting model adopted here as a baseline is an oracle that can only determine whether a comparison sentence contains the target concept or not. Based on this, the word-spotting model is constrained to rank target-containing sentences above sentences that do not include the target, but beyond this constraint, ranks are random. WordSpot was simulated 1000 times for each target concept, and correlations at the 95% confidence interval were reported.\n6. Relatedness-spotting Baseline (RelSpot): This is similar to the word-spotting baseline model, but the relatednessspotting model is an oracle that classifies words into one of three categories: targets, words related to the target, and unrelated words. Based on this, the relatedness-spotting model is constrained to rank target-containing sentences above sentences containing words related to the target, and these sentences, in turn, are constrained to be ranked above sentences comprised of unrelated words only. As with the WordSpot model, beyond this constraint, rankings are random. Note that the ranking heuristic used by RelSpot is often consistent with the behavioral responses, but participants do rank comparison sentences with related words higher than some target-containing sentences at non-trivial rates. RelSpot was simulated 1000 times for each target\nconcept, and correlations at the 95% confidence interval were reported."

      "heading" : "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Data collected from both the MDS task and free-ranking task were used to produce group rankings for the sentences associated with each target concept (see ancillary files). As expected, participants often ranked sentences that contained the target concept higher than sentences that did not, and often ranked sentences that contained a concept related to the target concept higher than sentences that did not contain the target concept or any related concepts, but these patterns were not absolute. For example (as shown in Table 1), the sentence The parent watched the sick child was considered more related to the target concept family as compared to the sentence The priest approached the lonely family, suggesting that participants considered the larger context when evaluating relationships between target concepts and comparison sentences. K-means clustering for k=3 to 5 was run on the mean rank data (as well as the mean ranks and variances) to assess whether relatedness varied continuously or discontinuously across sentences. For some target concepts, the mean sentence ranks across participants were clearly clustered by relatedness to the target concept, while for other target concepts, the sentence rankings varied more continuously (as illustrated in Figure 2). For example, data collected for the target concept eat suggests that comparison sentences can be grouped into four somewhat separable classes: sentences highly related, related, somewhat related, and unrelated to the target concept. Alternatively, data collected for the target concept storm do not clearly fall in to these relatedness classes.\nCross-test reliability was calculated for the subset of participants who completed both the MDS task and the free-ranking task (N=20). While the MDS task produces scores ranging from -1 to 1 associated with relatedness, the free-ranking tasks only produce ranks, and so only ranks were compared between tasks.

Given that the free-ranking task was on the order of seven times faster to complete, it may be a preferred method for collection of relatedness judgments."

      "heading" : "STS SYSTEM COMPARISON",
      "text" : "The sentence rankings from each of the STS models were correlated with the mean MDS rankings from participants, and the results are reported in Table 3. All models except for the n-gram model unambiguously outperformed the wordspotting baseline, but only the Ebiquity and Word2Vec systems outperformed the relationship-spotting benchmark system. These results suggest that all models except the n-gram model are capable of conceptual inference beyond simple word-spotting. The sub-baseline performance of the n-gram model might marginally improve with a larger corpus, but the interpretation would not change: higher-order models which can encode more abstract contextual information are consistently more predictive of human judgments as compared to the lower-order models that encode only surface information about local context. Indeed, both the Word2Vec and Ebiquity models consistently ranked sentences containing words related to the target above sentences that did not contain any related words. Given their beyond-benchmark performance, these models also appear capable of inferring some additional and useful conceptual structure.\nPerformance was not uniform across all target concepts. For some target concepts, STS results were quite similar to participant ranking (e.g. storm), and for others, there were large discrepancies (e.g. speak). Results for three representative target concepts compared to aggregate behavioral rankings are shown in Figure 3. To better understand the relationship between human and system ratings, the Ebiquity results were further examined at the individual sentence level.\nFor many comparison sentences and for most target concepts, the Ebiquity model produced rankings quite similar to those produced by the human raters, but there were notable exceptions. For several target concepts, some sentences were ranked more than 15 positions (of 31) higher or lower by the STS system than by human judgment. Some of these discrepancies suggest incompatibilities between the human task (i.e.\nrelatedness judgments) and the STS task (semantic similarity). Other discrepancies suggest true limitations of the STS systems.\nA number of these large discrepancies occurred when concepts were related by contrasts in meaning (i.e. antonyms). For example, some of the largest discrepancies between the human and Ebiquity rankings involved the target concept small. Small is a gradable antonym, on the opposite end of a pole with big. Because big and small are both adjectives describing two poles of size, they might appear in similar contexts in corpora. As a result, the sentence The big horse drank from the lake was ranked the seventh most similar sentence to the target concept small (i.e. 7/31) by the Ebiquity system, and 30/31 as “best related” to the target concept small by human participants.\nMultiple incompatible antonyms [7], which are mutually exclusive terms that belong to a set (e.g., the seasons of the year: spring, summer, fall, winter) showed similar patterns of re-\nsults. This was observed with spring (a target concept) and other seasons that appear in comparison sentences like winter (i.e. The park was empty in winter: Human rank 25/31; Ebiquity rank 7/31). These and other similar results highlight the different conceptions of similarity and relatedness, as well as the limitations inherent in low-dimensional similarity and relatedness scores. Different instructions or a different task may have induced behavioral results more in line with the Ebiquity rankings, but this is also a relatively unexplored distinction with respect to STS research.\nOther discrepancies between the human and STS results involved relationships that the STS model was not sensitive to, and that would not be remedied by alternative instructions or tasks. In these cases, the comparison sentences do not include the target concept, but instead, include concepts that prototypically embody the target concept or evoke it through entailment or implicature.\nEntailments are truths that logically must also hold, given that an initial statement was true, as in “Bob was murdered” entails “Bob is dead.” Similarly, implicatures are highly likely to be true, but not definitively so [8]. They convey meaning indirectly and are understood implicitly. The statement “Bob was buried” suggests “Bob is dead” via implicature, yet it is possible, though extremely unlikely, for someone to be buried alive. To see how the Ebiquity model is insensitive to important entailments, consider the target concept small and the human and Ebiquity rankings of comparison sentences that reference prototypically small objects, as shown in Table 4.\nParticipants clearly associated dimes and the concepts of finding or losing dimes with small, but the STS model did not. Participants rated sentences about dimes as more related to small than sentences containing the word small, but in reference to items that are not protypically small. The STS did not mimic this behavior, nor was it sensitive to the smallness of mice.\nResults from other target concepts similarly demonstrated the lack of STS model sensitivity to entailment and implicature. For the target concept speak, participants considered sentences with concepts like negotiate and interview: acts which involve speaking. Participants found these sentences highly related to speak, but the STS model did not: The commander negotiated with the council (Human rank 7/31; Ebiquity rank 24/31) and The author interviewed the scientist after the flood (Human rank 6/31; Ebiquity rank 18/31). For the target concept door, participants recognize that leaving a building such as a theater implicitly requires passing through a door, while the Ebiquity system does not, as in The wealthy couple left the theater (Human rank 10/31; Ebiquity rank 24/31).\nFinally, there were more complex implicatures that participants incorporated into their judgments that the Ebiquity system did not. As an example, the target concept tourist was evaluated with the comparison sentence The minister visited the prison (Human rank 23/31; Ebiquity rank 8/31). While visiting a location is the essence of tourism, prisons are perhaps the antithesis of a vacation destination, and so participants modulated their interpretation accordingly. A more complete and human-like conceptual knowledge representation and interpretation process that is better able to incorporate entailment, implicature, and antonymy should be expected to perform better in these contexts. Indeed, some automated approaches to text summarization and questionanswering have considered these factors [10]. Note that results from both the MDS and free-rank task were assembled into a collection of ancillary text files and have been made available for download. The files include lists of all concepts and sentences used in the tasks, along with word-sentence pairings for the 25 tested concepts. Mean ranks and standard deviations are reported for the two tasks individually, with sentences ordered by mean rank for each concept."

      "heading" : "CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We have presented a data set for evaluating semantic models based on human behavioral rankings. 775 English wordsentence pairs were constructed to embed concepts in meaningful contexts and generate a range of word-sentence relationships. Word-sentence pairs were annotated for semantic relatedness by human raters, and ratings were found reliable across rating tasks.\nTo illustrate the potential utility of this data set, results of the rating task were compared to several semantic textual similarity systems. Higher-order text systems like Word2Vec and UMBC Ebiquity often closely predicted human ratings, but failed to match human judgments in some cases. The first major disagreement between human and STS ratings arose from subtle differences between semantic relatedness and semantic similarity, and more attention may need to be paid to this distinction when developing evaluations and applications for semantic models. The second major disagreement came from a failure of the semantic models to capture entailment, implicature, and context. Human relatedness judgments are shaped by understanding of context and the ability to infer entailed and implied information. Semantic models will need to be enriched with additional sources to more closely parallel human semantic judgments."

One method for assessing the quality or authenticity of semantic information encoded in these systems is by comparison with human judgments. A data set for evaluating semantic models was developed consisting of 775 English word-sentence pairs, each annotated for semantic relatedness by human raters engaged in a Maximum Difference Scaling (MDS) task, as well as a faster alternative task. As a sample application of this relatedness data, behavior-based relatedness was compared to the relatedness computed via four off-the-shelf STS models: n-gram, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Word2Vec, and UMBC Ebiquity. Some STS models captured much of the variance in the human judgments collected, but they were not sensitive to the implicatures and entailments that were processed and considered by the participants. All text stimuli and judgment data have been made freely available.",
