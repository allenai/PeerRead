      "text" : "The rapid expansion of the Web is coupled with a startling increase in communication among members of the world via blogs, emails, forums, and social media platforms. Thus, it has become of increasing interest to analyze the authorship of Internet content, and be able to use this massive data to predict characteristics If a person from their use of language. In the task of author profiling, such characteristics can vary along dimensions of age, gender, and personality type, though we will focus on age, which has conventionally been the most difficult [15]. To be able to do so with high predictive power will have applications in a wide spectrum of fields, from law enforcement, to focused advertising. For example, such technology could be used to evaluate the truthfulness of self-reported ages in forums, and detect underage and illegal trading of products.\nIn this paper, we introduce chained heuristic solution to author profiling, using both classification and regression to predict author age. As in any Machine Learning algorithm involving text, we first extract relevant textual features and find a suitable representation of documents. We use Natural Language Processing techniques to extract content-based and stylistic features from text, and vectorize the frequencies of such aggregated features for each document.\n∗Undergraduate at Caltech Class of 2019. JPL Data Science Intern for Summer 2016. †JPL Co-mentor. ‡JPL Co-mentor.\nOur next step is using the vectorized documents in a Maximum Entropy Classifier, which has proven to be a viable and competitive algorithm in the NLP domain. Author age profiling becomes a problem of multi-class classification into age groups: xx-17|18-24|25-34|35-49|50-64|65-xx. We will analyze the effects of different feature vectors on the accuracy of MaxEnt classification in the Section 4.\nUsing the predicted age category, we transform the classification problem by using linear regression to map age to a continuous variable rather than a categorical one. Our regression implementation is simple LASSO regression using the same document vectors, but we add the predicted category from classification as another feature, so that the result from classification also influences what age is predicted. In Section 4, we will compare the performance of our chained method to that of ordinary linear regresssion, as outlined in Nguyen et al. [10].\nThe paper will proceed as follows. A survey of related work is presented in Section 2. A mathematical formulation of the MaxEnt model and other theoretical techniques is in Section 3. Section 4,5 overviews the datasets used and the feature extraction process. In Section 6 we will explain in detail our methodology and implementation, and we will discuss the results of our experiment in Section 7,8. Finally, in Section 9 we draw conclusions and present future plans for extending the age prediction task."

      "text" : "There has been considerable work recently in the task of author profiling. In feature selection, Houvardas and Stamatatos in 2006 showed extracting N-grams as an effective feature for classifying in the domain of author profiling [8]. In 2007, Estival et al. experimented with linguistic feature selection in author profiling, and revealed POS frequencies as a viable feature [6]. Calix et al. performed author matching from emails using 55 different stylistic features, along with a K-nearest Neighbors implementation, to achieve 76.72% accuracy [3].\nSpecifically on age identification, Pennebaker and Stone used LIWC to find a relation between the use of language as a person ages [14]. The problem has, however, been almost exclusively modeled as a classification problem, with a variety of machine learning methods ranging from Bayesian Methods, to Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. In 2011, Nguyen et al. were the first to treat age as a continuous variable via linear regression, and experimented with regression on various individual corpora [10]. As far as we\nare aware, though, we are the first to attempt a chained ensemble method of classification and regression to predict exact age."

      "text" : "Maximum Entropy classification is frequently used in NLP tasks such as POS tagging and sentence boundary segmentation. Due to its success with textual features, we decided to implement a MaxEnt classifier to perform age categorization. We will derive the foundations of the MaxEnt model in NLP, as well as the Generalized Iterative Scaling algorithm employed by Apache OpenNLP to solve the model.\nWe let p̃(c, d) denote the empirical probability of a training sample (c, d) with document vector d and category c, and N be the size of the training set. We also introduce a function for each feature fi,j in our document vector representation, such that:\nfi,j(c, d) =    N(wi)∑ l N(wl) , if c = cj , and d contains wi,\n0, otherwise.\nwhere cj denotes the possible categories, and wi the possible context tokens, and N() is a real valued function for counts within the document. Apache OpenNLP uses binarized document vectors by default, though we evidently edited it to use normalized frequency counts.\nSince each feature fi,j is a real valued function, it must have an expected value, calculated empirically by the training data:\np̃(fi,j) = ∑\nc,d\np̃(c, d)fi,j(c, d).\nWe can also calculate the actual expected value p(fi,j) from conditional probability:\np(fi,j) = ∑\nc,d\np(d)p(c | d)fi,j(c, d).\nWe look to restrain out MaxEnt model’s conditional distribution to satisfy the empirical value, so that,\n∑\nc,d\np(d)p(c | d)fi,j(c, d) = 1\nN\n∑\nc,d\np(c | d)fi,j(c, d)\n= ∑\nc,d\np̃(c, d)fi,j(c, d) = 1\nN\n∑\nc,d\nfi,j(c, d),\nwhere we approximate p(d) = p̃(d) = 1/N . Thus, we want to find a conditional distribution for our model p which satisfies:\n1. p(c | d) ≥ 0 ∀c, d. 2. ∑\nc p(c | d) = 1 ∀d.\n3. ∑\nc,d p(c | d)fi,j(c, d) = ∑ c,d fi,j(c, d) ∀i, j.\nFrom information theory, we know that the optimal model p∗ which satisfies the above constraints, is as close to uniform as possible, and is achieved by maximizing the entropy,\np∗ = max p\n( − ∑\nc,d\np(c | d) log p(c | d) ) .\nIf we set up and solve the Lagrangian [2], we get the multiclass version of the sigmoid function in logistic regression as\nour optimal solution,\np∗(c | d) = exp(\n∑ i,j\nλi,jfi,j(c, d))∑ c exp( ∑ i,j λi,jfi,j(c, d)) ."

      "text" : "Estimating the optimal λ parameters can be easily done with an iterative scaling algorithm. OpenNLP employs the simple GIS algorithm to do so.\nIt is guaranteed that no local maxima exist in the likelihood surface, so hillclimbing algorithms from any random initial distribution will find the global maximum entropy solution. We use the log likelihood as with Della Pietra et al. in 1997 [2]. Let λ be the parameter vector of all λi,j values, and pλ be the resulting probability model. The log likelihood is given by,\nℓ(λ) = log ∏\nd\npλ(c |d)\n= ∑\nd\n∑\ni,j\nλi,jfi,j(c, d)\n− ∑\nd\nlog ∑\nc\nexp (∑\ni,j\nλi,jfi,j(c, d) ) .\nAs in any hillclimbing algorithm, we seek ∆λ such that ℓ(λ+∆λ)−ℓ(λ) > 0. From Jensen’s inequality, we can lower bound the difference by an auxiliary function B [11],\nℓ(λ+∆λ)− ℓ(λ) ≥ B =\n1 + ∑\nd\n∑\ni,j\n∆λi,jfi,j(c, d)\n− ∑\nc\npλ(c | d)exp ( f#(c, d)∆λi,j ∑\ni,j\nfi,j(c, d) f#(c, d)\n) ,\nwhere f#(c, d) = ∑\ni,j fi,j(c, d) is the sum over all features.\nIt becomes easy to find ∆λ by merely differentiating B with respect to ∆λi,j , and setting it equal to zero to maximize B.\n∂B\n∂∆λi,j =\n∑\nd\nfi,j(c, d)\n− ∑\nc\npλ(c | d)fi,j(c, d)exp(∆λi,jf #(c, d)).\nSo, the GIS algorithm effectively solves for ∆λi,j and increments for each parameter λi,j .\n1. Input: Set of labelled documents d ∈ D and feature functions fi,j . 2. Initialize λi,j = 0 for all i, j. 3. Repeat until convergence: 4. For each λi,j : 5. Let ∆λi,j = 1\nf#(c, d) log\np̃(fi,j) p(fi,j) .\n6. Set λi,j ← λi,j +∆λi,j .\nThus, the resulting λ parameters make up our MaxEnt classifier, as desired."

Only choosing unigrams and bigrams, as in the NGRAM model, performed almost as well in predictive accuracy.\nWhile the accuracy is not very high, all models performed better than the baseline of 0.33, calculated by always predicting the most common category, which is xx-17, from the frequencies of age groups among the test data.\nTable 3 highlights the fine-grained report for the bestperforming GLOBAL model. It is clear that the model performs increasingly poorly as age group increases, most likely due to the lack of training data among those age groups.\nFor the younger age groups, GLOBAL’s performance was generally good. For the 18-24 age group, however, many posts in that group were rather predicted to be in the xx-17 age group, resulting in a low recall. This can be because most of the data in the xx-17 age group belonged to people at least 16. Because of this, the algorithm had trouble determining the difference between the two age groups, which could be fixed easily by setting looser boundaries for the age categories, and creating larger age groups as a result.\nAmong the older age groups, the algorithm began predicting posts in such categories as xx-17, probably due to the abundance of data in that category, and subsequent lack of data for people older than 50 years old."

Though we employed oversampling to mitigate the bias, both models had small coefficients for their features, and predicted relatively close to their respective intercepts.\nWhile in training, the MAE for both models remained relatively small, the correlation in DEFAULT of 0.608 gives an r2 = 0.37, which means only 37% of the variance can be explained. In ENSEMBLE, the r2 increases to 0.49. This is perhaps caused by the bias in training distribution, noisy data, and the fact that most ages lie close to each other, particularly after applying oversampling to the data.\nThe MAE of around 10 for ENSEMBLE means it predicts on average, 10 years away from the actual age. While this is high, the mean is skewed by the vast underpredictions for ages older than 50. It may be that language use does not change much after that age, though the more plausible reason is our lack of training data in the older age range.\nThe skew in performance is evident in Figure 3, which\nplots the predicted vs. actual age for a random sample of 600 in the test data, or in Figure 4, which plots the error for the same sample.\nIn addition, the ENSEMBLE model is dependent on the predictions of our MaxEnt classifier, which itself did not have high accuracy. If the classifier predicted age category perfectly, the MAE of the ENSEMBLE model would reduce to around 7."

      "heading" : "9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK",
      "text" : "We tried studying the relation between language usage and age for the task of author profiling. Our dataset used a collection of annotated corpora, belonging to forum posts, telephone speech, blogs, and tweets, where data from older age groups were duplicated to reduce bias.\nWe approached the age prediction problem via both classification, where age was separated into age groups, and regression, where age is treated as a continuous variable.\nIn classification, we got a predictive accuracy of at best 52%, roughly 20% over the baseline, by training a MaxEnt classifier with both content-based and stylistic features. However, precision and recall decreased drastically for older age groups. For the future, we can set better boundaries for users, perhaps by significant life stages rather than arbitrary 10-year age groups. Also, instead of normalized frequencies, we can experiment with tf-idf weights for features. In addition, rather than MaxEnt, we could compare performance to other classification methods, namely Support-Vector Machines or Random Forests.\nFor regression, we tried both default L1-regularized linear regression and an ensemble method that chains our MaxEnt classifier and passes its predicted age group as a separate category. The performance benefit was marginal, though both models suffered in correlation likely from bias in the training data. The chained regressor had a MAE of around 10 on the test set, 2 lower than an MAE of 11 using default regression.\nBoth models predicted well, within an MAE of 6, for ages under 50, but fell drastically in performance for older ages, most likely due to the small coefficients on the features. Fu-\nture work could involve dimensionality reduction, as SGD does not scale well with many features. Also, by further investigating the coefficients, we can compile a better, more concise list of features."
