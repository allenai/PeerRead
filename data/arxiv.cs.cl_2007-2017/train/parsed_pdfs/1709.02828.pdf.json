      "text" : "Question answering (QA) and information extraction systems have proven to be invaluable in wide variety of applications such as medical information collection on drugs and genes (Quirk and\nPoon, 2016), large scale health impact studies (Althoff et al., 2016), or educational material development (Koedinger et al., 2015). Recent progress in neural-network based extractive question answering models are quickly closing the gap with human performance on several benchmark QA tasks such as SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016), or NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2016a). However, current approaches to extractive question answering face several limitations:\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n02 82\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nS ep\n2 01\n7\n1. Computation is allocated equally to the entire document, regardless of answer location, with no ability to ignore or focus computation on specific parts. This limits applicability to longer documents.\n2. They rely extensively on expensive bidirectional attention mechanisms (Seo et al., 2016) or must rank all possible answer spans (Lee et al., 2016).\n3. While data-augmentation for question answering have been proposed (Zhou et al., 2017), current approaches still do not provide training data that can improve the performance of existing systems.\nIn this paper we demonstrate a methodology for addressing these three limitations, and make the following claims:\n1. Extractive Question Answering can be cast as a nested search process, where sentences provide a powerful document decomposition and an easy to learn search step. This factorization enables conditional computation to be allocated to sentences and spans likely to contain the right answer.\n2. When cast as a search process, models without bi-directional attention mechanisms and without ranking all possible answer spans can achieve near state of the art results on extractive question answering.\n3. Preserving narrative structure and explicitly incorporating type and question information into synthetic data generation is key to generating examples that actually improve the performance of question answering systems.\nOur claims are supported by experiments on the SQuAD dataset where we show that the Globally Normalized Reader (GNR), a model that performs an iterative search process through a document (shown visually in Figure 1), and has computation conditionally allocated based on the search process, achieves near state of the art Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores without resorting to more expensive attention or ranking of all possible spans. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Type Swaps, a type-aware data augmentation strategy that aligns named entities with a knowledge base and swaps them out for new entities that share the same type,\nimproves the performance of all models on extractive question answering.\nWe structure the paper as follows: in Section 2 we introduce the task and our model. Section 3 describes our data-augmentation strategy. Section 4 introduces our experiments and results. In Section 5 we discuss our findings. In Section 6 we relate our work to existing approaches. Conclusions and directions for future work are given in Section 7."

Words missing from the Common Crawl vocabulary are set to zero. In our experiments, all architectures considered have sufficient capacity to overfit the training set. We regularize the models by fixing the word embeddings throughout training, dropping out the inputs of the Bi-LSTMs with probability 0.3 and the inputs to the fullyconnected layers with probability 0.4 (Srivastava et al., 2014), and adding gaussian noise to the recurrent weights with σ = 10−6. Our models are trained using Adam with a learning rate of 0.0005, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, = 10−8 and a batch size of 32 (Kingma and Ba, 2014).\nAll our experiments are implemented in Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016), and we tokenize using Ciseau (Raiman, 2017). Despite performing beam-search during training, our model trains to convergence in under 4 hours through the use of efficient LSTM primitives in CuDNN (Chetlur et al., 2014) and batching our computation over examples and search beams.

By contrast, the BiDirectional Attention Flow model with batch size 32 requires 1260.23±17.26 seconds.

While this heuristic helps human readers filter out irrelevant parts of a document when searching for information, no explicit supervision of this kind is present in the dataset. Despite this absence, the distribution question representations learned by our models appear to utilize this heuristic. The final hidden state of the\n2https://github.com/allenai/ bi-att-flow\n3All numbers are averaged over 5 runs.\nquestion-encoding LSTMs naturally cluster based on question type (Table 1).\nIn other words, the task induces a question encoding that superficially respects type information. This property is a double-edged sword: it allows the model to easily weed out answers that are inapplicable, but also leads it astray by selecting a text span that shares the answer’s type but has the wrong underlying entity. A similar observation was made in the error analysis of (Weissenborn et al., 2017). We propose Type Swaps, an augmentation strategy that leverages this emergent behavior in order to improve the model’s ability to prune wrong answers, and make it more robust to surface form variation. This strategy has three steps:\n1. Locate named entities in document and question.\n2. Collect surface variation for each entity type:\nhuman → {Ada Lovelace, Daniel Kahnemann,...},\ncountry→ {USA, France, ...}, ...\n3. Generate new document-question-answer examples by swapping each named entity in an original triplet with a surface variant that shares the same type from the collection.\nAssigning types to named entities in natural language is an open problem, nonetheless when faced\nwith documents where we can safely assume that the majority of the entities will be contained in a large knowledge base (KB) such as Wikidata Vrandečić and Krötzsch (2014) we find that simple string matching techniques are sufficiently accurate. Specifically, we use a part of speech tagger (Honnibal, 2017) to extract nominal groups in the training data and string-match them with entities in Wikidata. Using this technique, we are able to extract 47,598 entities in SQuAD that fall under 6,380 Wikidata instance of4 types. Additionally we assign “number types” (e.g. year, day of the week, distance, etc.) to nominal groups that contain dates, numbers, or quantities5. These extraction steps produce 84,632 unique surface variants (on average 16.93 per type) with the majority of the variation found in humans, numbers or organizations as visible in Figure 4.\nWith this method, we can generate 2.92 · 10369 unique documents (average of 3.36 · 10364 new documents for each original document).

Models such as Lee et al. (2016) and Wang and Jiang (2016) overcome this difficulty by ranking all possible spans and thus never skipping a possible answer.

      "text" : "Type Swaps, our data augmentation strategy, offers a way to incorporate the nature of the question and the types of named entities in the answers into the learning process of our model and reduce sensitivity to surface variation. Existing neuralnetwork approaches to extractive QA have so far ignored this information. Augmenting the dataset with additional type-sensitive synthetic examples improves performance by providing better coverage of different answer types. Growing the number of augmented samples used improves the performance of all models under study (Table 4-5). With T ∈ [104, 5 · 104], (EM, F1) improve from (65.8 → 66.7, 74.0 → 75.0) for locally normalized models, and (66.6 → 68.4, 75.0 → 76.21)\n7The objective function difference explains the lower performance of globally versus locally normalized models on the Sentence score: local models must always assign the highest probability to the correct sentence, while global models only ensure the correct span has the highest probability. Thus global models do not need to enforce a high margin between the correct answer’s sentence score and others and are more likely to keep alternate sentences around.\nfor globally normalized models. Past a certain amount of augmentation, we observe performance degradation. This suggests that despite efforts to closely mimic the original training set, there is a train-test mismatch or excess duplication in the generated examples.\nOur experiments are conducted on two vastly different architectures and thus these benefits are expected to carry over to different models (Weissenborn et al., 2017; Seo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017), and perhaps more broadly in other natural language tasks that contain named entities and have limited supervised data."

      "heading" : "6 Related Work",
      "text" : "Our work is closely related to existing approaches in learning to search, extractive question answering, and data augmentation for NLP tasks.\nLearning to Search. Several approaches to learning to search have been proposed for various NLP tasks and conditional computation. Most recently, Andor et al. (2016) and Zhou et al. (2015) demonstrated the effectiveness of globally normalized networks and training with beam search for part of speech tagging and transition-based dependency parsing, while Wiseman and Rush (2016) showed that these techniques could also be applied to sequence-to-sequence models in several application areas including machine translation. These works focus on parsing and sequence prediction tasks and have a fixed computation regardless of the search path, while we show that the same techniques can also be straightforwardly applied to question answering and extended to allow for conditional computation based on the search path.\nLearning to search has also been used in context of modular neural networks with conditional computation in the work of Andreas et al. (2016) for image captioning. In their work reinforcement learning was used to learn how to turn on and off computation, while we find that conditional computation can be easily learnt with maximum likelihood and the help of early updates (Andor et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2015; Collins and Roark, 2004) to guide the training process.\nOur framework for conditional computation whereby the search space is pruned by a sequence of increasingly complex models is broadly reminiscent of the structured prediction cascades of (Weiss and Taskar, 2010). Trischler et al. (2016b)\nalso explored this approach in the context of question answering.\nExtractive Question Answering. Since the introduction of the SQuAD dataset, numerous systems have achieved strong results. Seo et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2017) and Xiong et al. (2016) make use of a bi-directional attention mechanisms, whereas the GNR is more lightweight and achieves similar results without this type of attention mechanism. The document representation used by the GNR is very similar to Lee et al. (2016). However, both Lee et al. (2016) and Wang and Jiang (2016) must score all O(N2) possible answer spans, making training and inference expensive. The GNR avoids this complexity by learning to search during training and outperforms both systems while scoring only O(B) spans. Weissenborn et al. (2017) is a locally normalized model that first predicts start and then end words of each span. Our experiments lead us to believe that further factorizing the problem and using global normalization along with our data augmentation would yield corresponding improvements.\nData augmentation. Several works use data augmentation to control the generalization error of deep learning models. Zhang and LeCun (2015) use a thesaurus to generate new training examples based on synonyms. Vijayaraghavan et al. (2016) employs a similar method, but uses Word2vec and cosine similarity to find similar words. Jia and Liang (2016) use a high-precision synchronous context-free grammar to generate new semantic parsing examples. Our data augmentation technique, Type Swaps, is unique in that it leverages an external knowledge-base to provide new examples that have more variation and finer-grained changes than methods that use only a thesaurus or Word2Vec, while also keeping the narrative and grammatical structure intact.\nMore recently Zhou et al. (2017) proposed a sequence-to-sequence model to generate diverse and realistic training question-answer pairs on SQuAD. Similar to their approach, our technique makes use of existing examples to produce new examples that are fluent, however we also are able to explicitly incorporate entity type information into the generation process and use the generated data to improve the performance of question answering models."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusions and Future Work",
      "text" : "In this work, we provide a methodology that overcomes several limitations of existing approaches to extractive question answering. In particular, our proposed model, the Globally Normalized Reader, reduces the computational complexity of previous models by casting the question answering as search and allocating more computation to promising answer spans. Empirically, we find that this approach, combined with global normalization and beam search during training, leads to near state of the art results. Furthermore, we find that a type-aware data augmentation strategy improves the performance of all models under study on the SQuAD dataset. The method is general, only requiring that the training data contains named entities from a large KB. We expect it to be applicable to other NLP tasks that would benefit from more training data.\nAs future work we plan to apply the GNR to other question answering datasets such as MS MARCO (Nguyen et al., 2016) or NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2016a), as well as investigate the applicability and benefits of Type Swaps to other tasks like named entity recognition, entity linking, machine translation, and summarization. Finally, we believe there a broad range of structured prediction problems (code generation, generative models for images, audio, or videos) where the size of original search space makes current techniques intractable, but if cast as learning-to-search problems with conditional computation, might be within reach."

Existing neural approaches make use of expensive bidirectional attention mechanisms or score all possible answer spans, limiting scalability. We propose instead to cast extractive QA as an iterative search problem: select the answer’s sentence, start word, and end word. This representation reduces the space of each search step and allows computation to be conditionally allocated to promising search paths. We show that globally normalizing the decision process and back-propagating through beam search makes this representation viable and learning efficient. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of this approach using our model, Globally Normalized Reader (GNR), which achieves the second highest single model performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (68.4 EM, 76.21 F1 dev) and is 24.7x faster than bi-attention-flow. We also introduce a data-augmentation method to produce semantically valid examples by aligning named entities to a knowledge base and swapping them with new entities of the same type. This method improves the performance of all models considered in this work and is of independent interest for a variety of NLP tasks.",
