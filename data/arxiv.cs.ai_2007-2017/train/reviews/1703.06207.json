Historical milestones have been frequently associated with computers matching or outperforming humans in difficult cognitive tasks (e.g. face recognition [2], personality classification [3], driving cars [4], or playing video games [5]), or defeating humans in strategic zero-sum encounters (e.g. Chess [6], Checkers [7], Jeopardy! [8], Poker [9], or Go [10]). In contrast, less attention has been given to developing autonomous machines that establish mutually cooperative relationships with people who may not share the machine's preferences. A main challenge has been that human cooperation does not require sheer computational power, but rather relies on intuition [11], cultural norms [12], emotions and signals [13, 14, 15, 16], and pre-evolved dispositions toward cooperation [17], common-sense mechanisms that are difficult to encode in machines for arbitrary contexts. Here, we combine a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm with novel mechanisms for generating and acting on signals to produce a new learning algorithm that cooperates with people and other machines at levels that rival human cooperation in a variety of two-player repeated stochastic games. This is the first general-purpose algorithm that is capable, given a description of a previously unseen game environment, of learning to cooperate with people within short timescales in scenarios previously unanticipated by algorithm designers. This is achieved without complex opponent modeling or higher-order theories of mind, thus showing that flexible, fast, and general human-machine cooperation is computationally achievable using a non-trivial, but ultimately simple, set of algorithmic mechanisms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 21:50:16 GMT  (1428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06207v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 14:26:33 GMT  (1428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06207v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 01:04:09 GMT  (1428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06207v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jacob w crandall", "mayada oudah", "tennom", "fatimah ishowo-oloko", "sherief abdallah", "jean-fran\\c{c}ois bonnefon", "manuel cebrian", "azim shariff", "michael a goodrich", "iyad rahwan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06207"}
