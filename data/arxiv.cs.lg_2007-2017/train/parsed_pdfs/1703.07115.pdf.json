      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION Deep learning has shown promising results in many machine learning applications. In computer vision, it has been successfully applied to problems such as object detection [4], English character recognition [10]. It also showed promising results for speech data where it has been applied for speech recognition [6] and spoken keyword spotting [5]. It has been studied that the effectiveness of deep networks lies in the layered representation [7]. A deep learning architecture automatically learns the hierarchy of feature representations where complex features are built on the top of the simple encodings. Higher layers construct more abstract representation of the input data enabling well-generalizing representations.\nRecently, there has been an attempt to analyze the layered representation built by a trained deep network for the classification task. Montavon et. al. [11] performed the kernel analysis of the data representations at each layer of the network trained for a supervised classification task. The representation is analyzed with the kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) [3] using a RBF kernel. At each layer, a kernel matrix is computed on the feature representation of the training data. The kernel space representation of the features is computed by projecting data onto leading v Eigen vectors of the kernel matrix. The dimensionality v controls the simplicity of the model. A smaller v corresponds to a simpler model while large value of v indicates relatively complex model. A linear classifier is then trained to this low rank representation to compute the training error rates. Interestingly, it has been observed that as deeper and deeper kernels are built, simpler and more accurate representations of the learning problem are obtained\n[11]. In other words, as representation evolves layer by layer, more energy gets concentrated in fewer and fewer leading Eigen vectors. The trend is observed in representations built by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) as well as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).\nFor a classification task, MLPs compute the complex mapping from input to output using the multiple fully connected layers. The weights in the network are updated using the backpropagation algorithm. Due to the large number of trainable parameters, MLPs often suffer from issues such as slow training process, over-fitting and large computation resources.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach for deep networks aimed at supervised classification. For each layer, we aim to find a transformation which enables a better representation of the data. A kernel matrix is defined through the transformation matrix of the layer. We setup an optimization problem to compute a desired layer transformation. Our optimization attempts to render a kernel increasingly more similar to the ideal kernel matrix. In an ideal kernel matrix, data points from a same class have kernel value equal to one while data points from different classes have zero similarity.\nTo evaluate a goodness of representations obtained layer after layer, we compared our results with a standard DNN trained with back-propagation which has exactly same architecture as ours. We observe that classification accuracies obtained with our approach are comparable to DNN accuracies. In addition to this, we also perform a kernel PCA analysis similar to [11],[12]. Experimental evaluation demonstrate that our layerwise training method indeed produce better representations layer by layer.\nWe performed extensive experiments on the publicly available image recognition (classification) datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that, instead of fixing an architecture a priori, there is a possibility of selectively adding layers to the network with guaranteed improved performance. It hints towards the feasibility of a modular approach for deep learning."

Larochelle et. al. [9] confirmed the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy indeed helps the optimization by initializing weights near a good local minimum. Also, it implicitly acts as a regularization that brings better generalization and produces good internal data representations.\nAutoencoders play an important role in unsupervised learning for deep architectures. Baldi et. al. [1] thoroughly studied the linear and non-linear auto encoders in the aspects such as their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory. Using a different aspect, Xu et.al. [13] demonstrated how information potential can be used to train a MLP (multilayer perceptron) layer-by-layer. It was demonstrated that the hidden layer of a MLP serves as an information filter which tries to best represent the desired output in that layer in the statistical sense of mutual information.\nThere has been efforts to analyze the hierarchical feature representation built by deep networks. Montavon et. al. [11],[12] performed a kernel analysis of a deep networks such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Pretrained Multi-layer Perceptron (PMLP) trained for a supervised multi-class classification task. Feature representation at each layer is analyzed for its complexity and accuracy with kernel PCA using a Gaussian kernel. It was observed that all deep networks create increasingly better representations of the learning problem layer by layer. Also, the structure (or type) of a deep network has an impact on the way representations are built. It was demonstrated that a layer wise representation built by CNN differs from that of MLP. Also, MLP starts the discrimination from a first layer itself while CNN postpones the discrimination task to later layers."

      "heading" : "B. Layer training",
      "text" : "A MLP build a hierarchy of feature representation where a subsequent layer build a representation on the top of the features computed by previous layers. An input to our first layer is the set of n labeled images [(t1, l1), ..., (tn, ln)] where t denotes a vectorized training image and l denotes the corresponding label. If M and N denotes the dimension of an input\nimage, t ∈ Rd where for a color image, d = MN × 3 while for a grayscale image, d = MN . Input data is projected onto a p dimensional space where p indicates the layer dimension. Fig. 1 shows our network architecture.\nAn operation at the kth layer of a MLP can be represented as follows\nXk = tanh(Dk−1Wk) Dk−1 ∈ Rn×d Wk ∈ Rd×p (1)\nwhere Dk−1 denotes the training data matrix, Wk denotes the weight matrix for the kth layer. Feature vectors of the training data matrix Dk−1 are appended with one to account for the bias term.\nSince the first layer directly interacts with the input data, D0 indicates the preprocessed input image data. At the start, our attempt is to calculate an appropriate transformation matrix W1 such that the feature representation at the output of the first layer is more favorable for the classification task. Since we are performing the multi-class classification task, in the ideal kernel matrix, points from the same class should depict the maximum similarity while points from different classes should have least similarity. Therefore, we specify a target kernel function as follows\nT (i, j) = { 1, if li = lj 0, otherwise\nwhere li and lj denotes the labels of the ith and jth training points, respectively.\nThe kernel function to be aligned with a target function is defined through the layer transformation matrix W1 as follows. Let K denotes the kernel matrix computed on the output of the layer. We use a Gaussian kernel defined as follows\nK(i, j) = exp −||xi − xj ||2\n2σ2 1 ≤ i ≤ n 1 ≤ j ≤ n (2)\nwhere xi and xj denotes the feature representation for ith and jth data sample at the output of the first layer. Each feature vector is made unit norm as follows\nxi = xi/||xi||2 (3)\nThe squared Euclidean norm between any two vectors can be expanded as follows\n||xi − xj ||22 = ||xi||22 + ||xj ||22 − 2xTi xj (4)\nUsing Eq. 2,3 and 4, a similarity between two vectors can be obtained as\nK(i, j) = exp −2(1− xTi xj)\n2σ2 (5)\nA kernel matrix K can thus be calculated as\nK = exp −(1−XTX)\nσ2 (6)\nNow, we solve a following optimization problem\nmin W1\n1\nn2 ||K − T ||2F + λ||W1||22 (7)\nHere, ||W1||22 denotes the L2 regularization term where λ controls the degree of regularization.\nThe optimization is solved using a gradient descent where the weight matrix W1 is initialized with values from a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation N (0, 1). The optimal solution obtained is used as the transformation matrix for the first layer. Input data is transformed as described in Eq. 1 which provides the feature representation at the first layer.\nThe subsequent layers are trained using the same procedure as described above where the feature representation provided by the previous layer is considered as an input to the current layer. Data pre-processing is done prior to the calculation of each layer transformation. The training procedure for a layer is described in Algorithm Block 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Training procedure for a kth layer of a MLP given previously trained (k − 1) layers\nprocedure TRAINING A kth LAYER Wk ← Random initilization ( 10−3 × N (0, 1)) Until convergence: Xk = tanh(Dk−1Wk) Make feature representations zero mean and unit norm K = exp\n−(1−XTk Xk) σ2\ncost = 1n2 ||K − T || 2 F + λ||Wk||22 gW = ddWij cost Wk = Wk − µ ∗ gW\nSince the transformation which minimizes the error between current kernel and an ideal kernel is sought, the kernel distance between points from the same class decrease while distance between points from different classes increase. Therefore, the transformation matrix computed at each layer projects data onto the space which is more favorable for the classification.\nTo perform the classification, any off-the-shelf non-linear classifier can be trained on the features at the output of a layer. To speed-up the computations at the test time, we train a fully connected layer (of dimension 100) and a softmax unit on these features. Note that the fully connected layer is trained directly on the features learned by a layer and training does NOT involve updation of previously calculated features. We will denote this fully connected layer as FC100."

The feature representation at each layer is analyzed similar to the procedure as described in [12].\nThe kernel matrix K is computed on the feature set Xk as described in Eq. 2. Eigen value decomposition of the kernel matrix is obtained as\nK = UΛUT (8)\nwhere Eigenvectors (columns of U ) have unit length and eigenvalues (diagonal entries in Λ) are sorted by decreasing magnitude.\nLet Ud and Λd denotes the d dimensional approximation of Eigen decomposition.

The dataset consist of 60k training images and 10k testing images.\nIn order to perform kernel PCA analysis on layer representations, we sequentially trained two layers, on the 5k training samples of the MNIST dataset. The layer dimension p is set to 784 for each layer. σ value was set to 1 for all the experiments. Fig. 3 shows the training and testing errors obtained at three layers through the kernel analysis. From Fig. 3(a), it can be seen that, as deeper representations are built, more energy is getting concentrated in fewer Eigen vectors with better training accuracy (lower training error). Fig. 3(b) shows the graph of the testing error. It can be seen that, our representation agrees with the kernel analysis results reported in [12].\nFig. 2(a) shows filters obtained at the first layer. Fig. 2(b) shows the filters obtained in the first layer of MLP and Pretrained MLP (PMLP) when an architecture of four layers is trained [12]. Note that, unlike the MLP filters displayed in Fig. 2(b), our approach produce rich features. Interestingly, our first layer features visually look similar to those of PMLP.\nWe also compared the classification performance of our approach with the DNN. Initially, we trained a layer using the proposed optimization and calculated the classification test accuracy by subsequently training a FC100 and softmax layer. We then trained a DNN with fully connected layer of dimension 784, FC100 and a softmax layer. The FC100 + softmax layer in our approach and a DNN used for comparison are trained until convergence. Fig. 4(a) shows the test accuracy comparison for varying sizes of training set. Subsequently, we trained an another layer on top of the features exacted from first layer. We also trained a DNN with same architecture. Fig. 4(b) shows the comparison plot. From these plots, it can observed that our approach indeed computes discriminative features which are suitable for classification. This underlines the efficacy of our layer-wise training and it effectiveness for object recognition."

Fig. 6 shows the test accuracy comparison with a DNN trained in the supervised setup. Note that, even with less amount of training data, our approach outperforms the DNN.

    "abstractText" : "Deep learning has shown promising results in many machine learning applications. The hierarchical feature representation built by deep networks enable compact and precise encoding of the data. A kernel analysis of the trained deep networks demonstrated that with deeper layers, more simple and more accurate data representations are obtained. In this paper, we propose an approach for layer-wise training of a deep network for the supervised classification task. A transformation matrix of each layer is obtained by solving an optimization aimed at a better representation where a subsequent layer builds its representation on the top of the features produced by a previous layer. We compared the performance of our approach with a DNN trained using back-propagation which has same architecture as ours. Experimental results on the real image datasets demonstrate efficacy of our approach. We also performed kernel analysis of layer representations to validate the claim of better feature encoding.",
