      "text" : "Neural models that exploit word embeddings have recently achieved impressive results on text classification tasks (Goldberg, 2015). Feed-forward Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), in particular, have emerged as a relatively simple yet powerful class of models for text classification (Kim, 2014).\nThese neural text classification models have tended to assume a standard supervised learning setting in which instance labels are provided. Here we consider an alternative scenario in which we assume\nthat we are provided a set of rationales (Zaidan et al., 2007; Zaidan and Eisner, 2008; McDonnell et al., 2016) in addition to instance labels, i.e., sentences or snippets that support the corresponding document categorizations. Providing such rationales during manual classification is a natural interaction for annotators, and requires little additional effort (Settles, 2011; McDonnell et al., 2016). Therefore, when training new classification systems, it is natural to acquire supervision at both the document and sentence level, with the aim of inducing a better predictive model, potentially with less effort.\nLearning algorithms must be designed to capitalize on these two types of supervision. Past work (Section 2) has introduced such methods, but these have relied on linear models such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Joachims, 1998), operating over sparse representations of text. We propose a novel CNN model for text classification that exploits both document labels and associated rationales.\nSpecific contributions of this work as follows. (1) This is the first work to incorporate rationales into neural models for text classification. (2) Empirically, we show that the proposed model uniformly outperforms relevant baseline approaches across five datasets, including previously proposed models that capitalize on rationales (Zaidan et al., 2007; Marshall et al., 2016) and multiple baseline CNN variants, including a CNN equipped with an attention mechanism. We also report state-of-the-art results on the important task of automatically assessing the risks of bias in the studies described in full-text biomedical articles (Marshall et al., 2016).

      "text" : "Kim (2014) proposed the basic CNN model we describe below and then build upon in this work. Properties of this model were explored empirically in (Zhang and Wallace, 2015). We also note that Zhang et al. (2016) extended this model to jointly accommodate multiple sets of pre-trained word embeddings. Roughly concurrently to Kim, Johnson and Zhang (2014) proposed a similar CNN architecture, although they swapped in one-hot vectors in place of (pre-trained) word embeddings. They later developed a semi-supervised variant of this approach (Johnson and Zhang, 2015).\nIn related recent work on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models for text, Tang et al. (2015) proposed using a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer to represent each sentence and then passing another RNN variant over these. And Yang et al. (2016) proposed a hierarchical network with two levels of attention mechanisms for document classification. We discuss this model specifically as well as attention more generally and its relationship to our proposed approach in Section 4.3.\n2.2 Exploiting rationales\nIn long documents the importance of sentences varies; some are more central than others. Prior work has investigated methods to measure the relative importance sentences (Ko et al., 2002; Murata et al., 2000). In this work we adopt a particular view of sentence importance in the context of document classification. In particular, we assume that documents comprise sentences that directly support their categorization. We call such sentences rationales.\nThe notion of rationales was first introduced by Zaidan et al. (2007). To harness these for classification, they proposed modifying the Support Vector Machine (SVM) objective function to encode\n1https://github.com/yezhang-xiaofan/ Rationale-CNN\n2https://github.com/bwallace/ rationale-CNN\na preference for parameter values that result in instances containing manually annotated rationales being more confidently classified than ‘pseudo’instances from which these rationales had been stripped. This approach dramatically outperformed baseline SVM variants that do not exploit such rationales. Yessenalina et al. (2010) later developed an approach to generate rationales.\nAnother line of related work concerns models that capitalize on dual supervision, i.e., labels on individual features. This work has largely involved inserting constraints into the learning process that favor parameter values that align with a priori featurelabel affinities or rankings (Druck et al., 2008; Mann and McCallum, 2010; Small et al., 2011; Settles, 2011). We do not discuss this line of work further here, as our focus is on exploiting provided rationales, rather than individual labeled features."

      "text" : "We first review the simple one-layer CNN for sentence modeling proposed by Kim (2014). Given a sentence or document comprising n words w1, w2,...,wn, we replace each word with its d-\ndimensional pretrained embedding, and stack them row-wise, generating an instance matrix A ∈ Rn×d.\nWe then apply convolution operations on this matrix using multiple linear filters, these will have the same width d but may vary in height. Each filter thus effectively considers distinct n-gram features, where n corresponds to the filter height. In practice, we introduce multiple, redundant features of each height; thus each filter height might have hundreds of corresponding instantiated filters. Applying filter i parameterized by Wi ∈ Rhi·d to the instance matrix induces a feature map fi ∈ Rn−hi+1. This process is performed by sliding the filter from the top of the matrix (the start of the document or sentence) to the bottom. At each location, we apply elementwise multiplication between filter i and sub-matrix A[j : j + hi − 1], and then sum up the resultant matrix elements. In this way, we induce a vector (feature map) for each filter.\nWe next run the feature map through an elementwise non-linear transformation. Specifically, we use the Rectified Linear Unit, or ReLU (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). We extract the maximum value oi from each feature map i (1-max pooling).\nFinally, we concatenate all of the features oi to form a vector representation o ∈ R|F | for this instance, where |F | denotes the total number of filters. Classification is then performed on top of o, via a softmax function. Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is often applied at this layer as a means of regularization. We provide an illustrative schematic of the basic CNN architecture just described in Figure 1. For more details, see (Zhang and Wallace, 2015).\nThis model was originally proposed for sentence classification (Kim, 2014), but we can adapt it for document classification by simply treating the document as one long sentence. We will refer to this basic CNN variant as CNN in the rest of the paper. Below we consider extensions that account for document structure."

We aim to develop a model that can exploit these annotations during training to improve classification. Here we achieve this by developing a hierarchical model that estimates the probabilities of individual sentences being rationales and uses these estimates to inform the document level classification.\nAs a first step, we extend the CNN model above to explicitly account for document structure. Specifically, we apply a CNN to each individual sentence in a document to obtain sentence vectors independently. We then sum the respective sentence vectors to create a document vector.3 As before, we add a softmax layer on top of the document-level vector to perform classification. We perform regularization by applying dropout both on the individual sentence vectors and the final document vector. We will refer to this model as Doc-CNN. Doc-CNN forms the basis for our novel approach, described below."

      "heading" : "4.2 RA-CNN",
      "text" : "In this section we present the Rationale-Augmented CNN (RA-CNN). Briefly, RA-CNN induces a document-level vector representation by taking a weighted sum of its constituent sentence vectors. Each sentence weight is set to reflect the estimated probability that it is a rationale in support of the most likely class. We provide a schematic of this model in Figure 2.\nRA-CNN capitalizes on both sentence- and document-level supervision. There are thus two steps in the training phase: sentence level training and document level training. For the former, we apply a CNN to each sentence j in document i to obtain sentence vectors xijsen. We then add a softmax layer parametrized by Wsen; this takes as input sentence vectors. We fit this model to maximize the probabilities of the observed rationales:\n3We also experimented with taking the average of sentence vectors, but summing performed better in informal testing.\np(yijsen = k;E,C,Wsen) = exp(W(k)Tsen xijsen)∑Ksen k=1 exp(W (k)T sen x ij sen)\n(1) Where yijsen denotes the rationale label for sentence j in document i, Ksen denotes the number of possible classes for sentences, E denotes the word embedding matrix, C denotes the convolution layer parameters, and Wsen is a matrix of weights (comprising one weight vector per sentence class).\nIn our setting, each sentence has three possible labels (Ksen = 3). When a rationale sentence appears in a positive document,4 it is a positive rationale; when a rationale sentence appears in a negative document, it is a negative rationale. All other sen-\n4All of the document classification tasks we consider here are binary, although extension of our model to multi-class scenarios is straight-forward.\ntences belong to a third, neutral class: these are nonrationales. We also experimented with having only two sentence classes: rationales and non-rationales, but this did not perform as well as explicitly maintaining separate classes for rationales of different polarities.\nWe train an estimator using the provided rationale annotations, optimizing over {E,C,Wsen} to minimize the categorical cross-entropy of sentence labels. Once trained, this sub-model can provide conditional probability estimates regarding whether a given sentence is a positive or a negative rationale, which we will denote by ppos and pneg, respectively.\nWe next train the document-level classification model. The inputs to this are vector representations of documents, induced by summing over constituent sentence vectors, as in Doc-CNN. However, in the RA-CNN model this is a weighted sum. Specifically, weights are set to the estimated probabilities\nthat corresponding sentences are rationales in the most likely direction. More precisely:\nxidoc = Ni∑ j=1 xijsen ·max{pijpos, pijneg} (2)\nWhere Ni is the number of sentences in the ith document. The intuition is that sentences likely to be rationales will have greater influence on the resultant document vector representation, while the contribution of neutral sentences (which are less relevant to the classification task) will be minimized.\nThe final classification is performed by a softmax layer parameterized by Wdoc; the inputs to this layer are the document vectors. The Wdoc parameters are trained using the document-level labels, yidoc:\np(yidoc = k;E,C,Wdoc) = exp(W(k)Tdoc x i doc)∑Kdoc\nk=1 exp(W (k)T doc x i doc) (3)\nwhere Kdoc is the cardinality of the document label set. We optimize over parameters to minimize crossentropy loss (w.r.t. the document labels).\nWe note that the sentence- and document-level models share word embeddings E and convolution layer parameters C, but the document-level model has its own softmax parameters Wdoc. When training the document-level model, E, C and Wdoc are fit, but we hold Wsen fixed.\nThe above two-step strategy can be equivalently described as follows. We first estimate E, C and Wsen, which parameterize our model for identifying rationales in documents. We then move to fitting our document classification model. For this we initialize the word embedding and convolution parameters to the E and C estimates from the preceding step. We then directly minimize the document level classification objective, tuning E and C and simultaneously fitting Wdoc.\nNote that this sequential training strategy differs from the alternating training approach commonly used in multi-task learning (Collobert and Weston, 2008). We found that the latter approach does not work well here, leading us to instead adopt the cascade-like feature learning approach (Collobert and Weston, 2008) just described.\nOne nice property of our model is that it naturally provides explanations for its predictions: the model identifies rationales and then categorizes documents informed by these. Thus if the model classifies a test instance as positive, then by construction the sentences associated with the highest pijpos estimates are those that the model relied on most in coming to this disposition. These sentences can of course be output in conjunction with the prediction. We provide concrete examples of this in Section 7.2."

      "text" : "One may view RA-CNN as a supervised variant of a model equipped with an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014). On this view, it is apparent that rather than capitalizing on rationales directly, we could attempt to let the model learn which sentences are important, using only the document labels. We therefore construct an additional baseline that does just this, thereby allowing us to assess the impact of learning directly from rationale-level supervision.\nFollowing the recent work of Yang et al. (2016), we first posit for each sentence vector a hidden representation uijsen. We then define a sentence-level context vector us, which we multiply with each u ij sen to induce a weight αij . Finally, the document vector is taken as a weighted sum over sentence vectors, where weights reflect α’s. We have:\nuijsen = tanh(Wsx ij sen + bs) (4)\nαij = exp(uTs u ij sen)∑Ni\nj exp(uTs u ij sen)\n(5)\nxidoc = Ni∑ j αijx ij sen (6)\nwhere xidoc again denotes the document vector fed into a softmax layer, and Ws, us and bs are learned during training.

Briefly, the task concerns assessing the reliability of the evidence presented in full-text biomedical journal articles that describe the conduct and results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This involves, e.g., assessing whether or not patients were properly blinded as to whether they were receiving an active treatment or a comparator (such as a placebo). If such blinding is not done correctly, it compromises the study by introducing statistical bias into the treatment efficacy estimate(s) derived from the trial.\nA formal system for making bias assessments is codified by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins et al., 2011). This tool defines multiple domains; the risk of bias may be assessed in each of these. We consider four domains here. (1) Random sequence generation (RSG): were patients were assigned to treatments in a truly random fashion? (2) Allocation concealment (AC): were group assignments revealed to the person assigning patients to groups (so that she may have knowingly or unknowingly) influenced these assignments? (3) Blinding of Participants and Personnel (BPP): were all trial participants and individuals involved in running the trial blinded as to who was receiving which treatment? (4) Blinding of outcome assessment (BOA): were the parties who measured the outcome(s) of interest blinded to the intervention group assignments? These assessments are somewhat subjective. To increase transparency, researchers performing RoB assessment therefore record rationales (sentences from articles) supporting their assessments."

This model exploits the intuition that the risks of bias across the domains codified in the aforementioned Cochrane RoB tool will likely be correlated. That is, if we know that a study exhibits a high risk of bias for one domain, then it seems reasonable to assume it is at an elevated risk for the remaining domains. Furthermore, Marshall et al.

For this we initialized embedding and convolution layer parameters to the estimates from the preceding sentence-level training step (though these were further tuned to optimize the document-level objective).\nFor RA-CNN, we tuned the dropout rate (range: 0-.9) applied at the sentence vector level on each training fold (using a subset of the training data as a validation set) during the document level training phase. Anecdotally, we found this has a greater effect than the other model hyperparameters, which we thus set after a small informal process of experimentation on a subset of the data. Specifically, we fixed the dropout rate at the document level to 0.5, and we used 3 different filter heights: 3, 4 and 5, following (Zhang and Wallace, 2015). For each filter height, we used 100 feature maps for the baseline CNN, and 20 for all the other CNN variants.\nFor parameter estimation we used ADADELTA (Zeiler, 2012), mini-batches of size 50, and an early stopping strategy (using a validation set)."

We report the mean and observed ranges in accuracy across these 5 replications for these models, because attributes of the model (notably, dropout) and the estimation procedure render model fitting stochastic (Zhang and Wallace, 2015). We do not report ranges for SVM-based models because the variance inherent in the estimation procedure is much lower for these simpler, linear models.\nResults on the RoB datasets and the movies dataset are shown in Tables 2 and Table 3, respectively. RA-CNN consistently outperforms all of the baseline models, across all five datasets. We also\nobserve that CNN/Doc-CNN do not necessarily improve over the results achieved by SVM-based models, which prove to be strong baselines for longer document classification. This differs from previous comparisons in the context of classifying shorter texts. In particular, in previous work (Zhang and Wallace, 2015) we observed that CNN outperforms SVM uniformly on sentence classification tasks (the average sentence-length in these datasets was about 10). In contrast, in the datasets we consider in the present paper, documents often comprise hundreds of sentences, each in turn containing multiple words. We believe that it is in these cases that explicitly modeling which sentences are most important will result in the greatest performance gains, and this aligns with our empirical results.\nAnother observation is that AT-CNN does often improve performance over vanilla variants of CNN (i.e., without attention), especially on the RoB datasets, probably because these comprise longer documents. However, as one might expect, RACNN clearly outperforms AT-CNN by exploiting rationale-level supervision directly. And by exploiting rationale information directly, RA-CNN is able to consistently perform better than baseline CNN and SVM model variants. Indeed, we find that RACNN outperformed MT-SVM on all of the RoB datasets, and this was accomplished without exploiting cross-domain correlations (i.e., without multitask learning)."

That is, if we know that a study exhibits a high risk of bias for one domain, then it seems reasonable to assume it is at an elevated risk for the remaining domains. Furthermore, Marshall et al.

Specifically, we consider scenarios in which annotators explicitly mark sentences (or snippets) that support their overall document categorization, i.e., they provide rationales. Our model exploits such supervision via a hierarchical approach in which each document is represented by a linear combination of the vector representations of its component sentences. We propose a sentence-level convolutional model that estimates the probability that a given sentence is a rationale, and we then scale the contribution of each sentence to the aggregate document representation in proportion to these estimates. Experiments on five classification datasets that have document labels and associated rationales demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Moreover, our model naturally provides explanations for its predictions.",
