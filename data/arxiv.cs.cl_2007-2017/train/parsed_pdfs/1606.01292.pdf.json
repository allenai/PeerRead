      "text" : "In recent years, neural network based conversation models (Serban et al., 2015b; Sordoni et al., 2015b; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Shang et al., 2015) have emerged as a promising complement to traditional partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) models (Young et al., 2013). The neural net based techniques require little in the way of explicit linguistic knowledge, e.g., creating a semantic parser, and therefore have promise of scalability, flexibility, and language independence. Broadly\nspeaking, there are two approaches to building a neural conversation model. The first is to train what is essentially a conversation-conditioned language model, which is used in generative mode to produce a likely response to a given conversation context. The second approach is retrieval-based, and aims at selecting a good response from a list of candidates taken from the training corpus.\nNeural conversation models are usually trained similarly to neural machine translation models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014), which treat response generation as a surface-to-surface transformation. While simple, it is possible that these models would benefit from explicit modeling of conversational dynamics, specifically the attention and intention processes hypothesized in discourse theory (Grosz and Sidner, 1986). A recent improvement along these lines is the hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder in (Serban et al., 2015b; Sordoni et al., 2015b) that incorporates two levels of recurrent networks, one for generating words and one for modeling dependence between conversation turns. In this paper, we extend this approach further, and propose an explicit intention/attention model.\nWe further tackle a second key problem of neural conversation models, their tendency to generate generic, non-specific responses (Vinyals and Le, 2015; Li et al., 2016). To address the problem of specificity, a maximum mutual information (MMI) method for generation was proposed in (Li et al., 2016), which models both sides of the conversation, each conditioned on the other. While we find this method effective, training the additional model doubles the computational cost.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 29\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nJ un\n2 01\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we introduce a novel attention with intention neural conversation model that integrates an attention mechanism into a hierarchical model. Without the attention mechanism, the model resembles the models in (Serban et al., 2015b) but performs better. Visualization of the intention layer in the model shows that it indeed is relevant to intent. Second, we address the specificity problem by incorporating inverse document frequency (IDF) (Salton and Buckley, 1988; Ramos, 2003) into the training process. The proposed training algorithm uses reinforcement learning with the IDF value of the generated sentences as a reward signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method incorporating specificity into the training objective function. Empirically, we find that it performs better than the dual-model method of (Li et al., 2016). Lastly, we demonstrate that the proposed model also performs well for retrieval-based conversation modeling. Using a recently proposed evaluation metric (Lowe et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2016), we observed that this model was able to incorporate term-frequency inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) (Salton and Buckley, 1988) and significantly outperformed a TFIDF retrieval baseline and the model without using TF-IDF."

      "heading" : "2 The model",
      "text" : "The proposed model is in the encoder-decoder framework (Sutskever et al., 2014) but incorporates a hierarchical structure to model dependence between turns of conversation process. The encoder network processes the user input and represents it as a vector. This vector is the input to a recurrent network that models context or intention to generate response in the decoder network. The decoder generates a response sequence word-by-word. For each word, the decoder uses an attention model on the words in the user input. Following (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), we refer the conversation context as intention. Because an attention model is used in the decoder, we denote this model as attention with intention (AWI) neural conversation model. A detailed illustration for a particular turn is in Figure 1. We elaborate each component of this model in the following sections."

The model uses a feed-forward network to process this sequence. It has two inputs. The first is a simple word unigram feature, extracted as the average of the word embeddings in x(k). The second input is a representation of the previous response. This representation is also a word unigram feature, but is applied on the past response. The output, u(k) ∈ Rdx , from the top layer of the feed-forward network is a vector representation of the user input. In addition to this vector representation, the encoder network outputs the vector sequence x(k)."

To model turn-level dynamics, the activity in z(k) is dependent on the activity in the previous turn z(k-1) and the user input at the current turn. Therefore, it is natural to represent z(k) as follows\nz(k) = tanh ( Wiz (k-1) + Uiu (k) ) , (1)\nwhere tanh() is a tanh operation. Wi ∈ Rdz×dz and Ui ∈ Rdz×dx are matrices to transform inputs to a space with dimension dz . Usually, we apply multiple layers of the above non-linear processing, and the higher layer only applies Wi to the output from the layer below. Notice that Wis are untied across layers. The output from the top one is the representation of the intention network."

      "heading" : "2.3 Decoder network",
      "text" : "Decoder network has output y(k)n ∈ RV , a vector with dimension of vocabulary size V . Each element of the vector represents a probability of generating a particular word at position n. This probability is conditioned on y(k)n-1, the word generated before, the above described intention vector z(k) and the encoder output x(k). To compute this probability, it uses softmax on a response vector r(k)n ∈ RV . The probability is defined as follows\np(y (k) n |y(k)n-1, z (k),x(k)) = softmax(r (k) n ). (2)\nThe decoder uses the following modules to generate response vector r(k)n .\nRNN For position n, the hidden state v(k)n of the RNN is recursively computed as\nv (k) n = tanh ( Vrv (k) n-1 + Wry (k) n-1 + Urr (k) n-1 ) , (3)\nwhere v(k)n-1, y (k) n-1 and r (k) n-1 each represent the previous hidden state, the word generated and the response vector for word position n − 1. Vr ∈ Rdr×dr , Wr ∈ Rdr×dV and Ur ∈ Rdr×dV are matrices to transform their right side inputs to a space with dimension dr. During training, y (k) n-1 is a one-hot vector with its non-zero element corresponding to the index of the word at n− 1. During test, it is still a one-hot vector but the index of the non-zero element is from beam search or greedy search at position n− 1. We apply multiple layers of the above process on v(k)n , with the higher layer uses only the lower layer output in the left side of (3). Parameters such as Vr are untied across layers. The top level response in (3) is the RNN output. To incorporate conversation context, the initial state v(k)n at n = 0 is set to z(k) from the intention network.\nAttention layer We use the content-based attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). It is a single layer neural network that aligns the target side hidden state v(k)n-1 at the previous position n− 1 with the source side representation u(k)m at word position m. The alignment weight wynm is computed as follows\neynm = b T tanh(Vav (k) n-1 + Uax (k) m ), (4)\nwynm = exp eynm∑M\nj=1 exp(eynj) , (5)\na (k) n = ∑ m wynmx (k) m , (6)\nwhere Va ∈ Rda×dV and Ua ∈ Rda×dx are matrices to transform their inputs to a space with dimension da. b ∈ Rda is a vector. The softmax operation in (5) is normalized on the user input sequence. a(k)n in (6) is the output of the attention layer.\nResponse generation We use the following feedforward network to generate a response vector r(k)n ∈ RdV , using the decoder RNN output v(k)n and the attention layer output a(k)n ; i.e.,\nr (k) n = tanh ( Vgv (k) n + Uga (k) n ) , (7)\nwhere Vg ∈ RdV ×dr and Ug ∈ RdV ×da are matrices to transform their right side inputs to a space with dimension dV . Similarly as those networks described above, we use untied multiple layers to generate r(k)n , and the input to the higher layer only use the output from the layer below. The top layer output is fed into softmax operation in Eq. (2) to compute the probability of generating words.\nInput similarity feature We construct a linear direct connection between user inputs and the output layer. To achieve this, a large matrix P with dimension V × V is used to project each input word to a high dimension vector with dimension size V . The projected words are then averaged to have a vector m(k) with dimension V . This vector is added to the response vector r(k)n , so that Eq. (2) is computed as softmax(r (k) n + m\n(k)). Since m(k) is applied to all word positions at turn k, it provides a global bias to the output distribution."

      "text" : "Alternatively, we cast our problem of optimizing a model directly for specificity in the reinforcement learning framework (Sutton and Barto, 1988). The decoder is an agent with its policy from Eq. (2). Its action is to generate a word using the policy, and therefore it has V actions to take at each time. At the end of generating a whole sequence of words for response, the agent receives a reward, calculated as the sentence level IDF score of the generated response. Training therefore should find a policy that maximizes the expected reward.\nThis problem can be solved using REINFORCE (Williams, 1992), in which the gradient to update model parameter is calculated as follows\n∆θ ∝ ( r(w(k))− b(x(k)) ) (11)\n∂ log ∏\nn p(y (k) n |y(k)n-1, z(k),x(k); θ)) ∂θ ,\nwhere r(w(k)) = idf(w(k)) is the IDF score of the generated response w(k) at turn k. b(x(k)) is called reinforcement baseline. It in practice can be set empirically as an arbitrary number to improve convergence (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015). One convenient way of estimating the baseline is the mean of the IDF values on the training set, which is used in this paper.\nNotice that the IDF score is computed on the decoded responses w(k), but the log-likelihood is com-\nputed on the correct response. Therefore, the algorithm improves likelihood of the correct response and also encourages generating responses with high IDF scores."

The TF-IDF is a vector for a context computed as follows for a word w in a context c,\ntfidf(w, c,C) = o(w, c)× log N |c ∈ C : w ∈ c| ,\nwhere o(w, c) is the number of times the word w occurs in the context c. For retrieval, a vector for a conversation history is firstly created, with element computed as above for each word in the conversation history. Then, a TF-IDF vector is computed for each response.

We use BLEU with 4-gram. While BLEU may unfairly penalize paraphrases with different wording, it has found correlated well with human judgement on responses generation tasks (Galley et al., 2015). The second measure is perplexity (Brown et al., 1992), which measures the likelihood of generating a word given observations. We use it in section 4.4.1 to compare the proposed model with respect to other neural network models that also report perplexity. However, since our training algorithms in Sec. 3.2 is designed to improve specificity, which is not directly correlated with the standard likelihood, we only report perplexity in section 4.4.1. The third metric is corpus level IDF score for specificity, computed in (10).\nSince our model is also used for retrieval, we\nadopt a response selection measure proposed in (Lowe et al., 2015), in which the performance of a conversation model is measured by the recall rate of those correct responses in the top ranks. This metric is called Recall@k (R@k). The model is asked to select the k most likely responses, and it is correct if the true response is among these k responses. The number of candidates for retrieval is 10, following (Lowe et al., 2015).

The BLEU score for ngram was obtained by sampling from the n-gram\nand comparing the sampled response to a typical response. Its response has BLEU score of 0.08 if using BLEU with 1-gram. Because it cannot be matched in 4 gram with the typical response, its BLEU with 4 gram is 0.

However, grounding the generated conversation with actions and knowledge is not studied in this paper. It will be a future work.\nThe proposed model is related to the recent works in (Shang et al., 2015; Vinyals and Le, 2015; Sordoni et al., 2015a), which use an encoder-decoder framework to model conversation. The closest work is in (Sordoni et al., 2015a). This model differs from that work in using an attention model, an additional input similarity feature, and its decoder architecture. Importantly, this model is used not only for generation as in those previous work, but also for retrieval.\nPrior work to potentially increase specificity or diversity aims at producing multiple outputs (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998; Gimpel et al., 2013) and our work is the same as in (Li et al., 2016) to produce a single nontrivial output. Instead of using an objective function in (Li et al., 2016) that has an indirect relation to specificity, our model uses a specificity measure directly for training and decoding."

We demonstrate the use of this model to generate help desk responses, where users are asking questions about PC applications. Our model is distinguished by two characteristics. First, it models intention across turns with a recurrent network, and incorporates an attention model that is conditioned on the representation of intention. Secondly, it avoids generating nonspecific responses by incorporating an IDF term in the objective function. The model is evaluated both as a pure generation model in which a help-desk response is generated from scratch, and as a retrieval model with performance measured using recall rates of the correct response. Experimental results indicate that the model outperforms previously proposed neural conversation architectures, and that using specificity in the objective function significantly improves performances for both generation and retrieval.",
