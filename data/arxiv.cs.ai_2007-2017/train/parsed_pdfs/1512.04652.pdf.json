      "text" : "Lung cancer is a deadly cancer that has killed large number of people every year. The survival rate of cancer is about 15%. Statistics show that victims of breast, prostate and colon overall are less than the lung cancer victims. Approximately 60% of patients are men and 33% of women have lung cancer. Lung cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If not diagnosed, this growth can spread beyond the lung into nearby tissue in a process called metastasis and gradually, into other parts of the body. Due to most cancers start in lung, they are known as primary cancers which they are carcinomas that derive from epithelial cells. 80–90% of lung cancers [1] in reason of long-term exposure to tobacco smoke,[2] these cases are often attributed to a combination of genetic factors,[3]radon gas,[3]asbestos,[4] and air pollution[4] including secondhand smoke while nonsmokers account is only 10–15% of lung cancer cases.[5] Symptoms of lung cancer are coughing up blood. It is the most common symptoms in lung cancer. Weight loss and shortness of breath [1] can be another symptoms of this disease. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT scan). With a biopsybiopsy the diagnosis is confirmed[6].Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy performs biopsybiopsy. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Treatment and prognosis depend on the histological type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the patient's general well-being, measured by performance status. Survival depends on stage, overall health, and other factors. Overall, 15% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis.[7] Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancerrelated death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.38 million deaths annually, as of 2008.[8]. However the 5-\naCorresponding author: Ahmad Enhesari, Department of the radiology, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran. Email:enhesari@kmu.ac.ir.\nyear survival rate of localized stage is about 50%. Localized stage cancer is the cancer that does not spread to additional sites like lymph node within the body. Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate. Due to have so many factors to diagnose the lungcancer patient. It causes to make the physician’s job difficult.A physician often makes decisions by evaluating the current test results of a patient and by referring to the previousdecisions he made on other patience with the same condition [9]. On the other, all symptoms of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas, thus leading to cancer detection of only 24% in early stages [10, 11]. We need an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate. For accurate detection of this disease, it need characterizes efficient features (symptoms) and delete redundancy or unrelevant feature among all features. Features are useful in many aspect of applications [31-33] and feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features such that the selected feature subset has lower cardinality and provides higher accuracy. Until now, researchers have studied various aspects of feature selection. There are two key aspects of feature selection: feature evaluation and search strategies. Feature evaluation is about how to measure the goodness of a feature subset [12, 13]. In search strategies, heuristic searches employ heuristics to conduct the search process. Due to their polynomial complexity, they can be implemented much faster than the previous search strategies.Until now many heuristic algorithms with different strategies have been proposed [14], but they have their own problem.Hyper-heuristic (HH) approach is a newest heuristic algorithm which was introduced in 2000 [23], solve these problems, properly. It has two levels, at the low level, there is a set of local searches which also known as Low Level Heuristics (LLH)s. The characteristic of these LLHs may be problem-oriented and may change from one problem to another. At the high level, there is a black-box choice function. It is a supervisor that manages the choice of low level heuristic. Recent studies on HHs have verified their successes on a wide variety of real-world problems. They not only converge to high-quality solutions but also search more efficiently than their conventional counterparts [15-17]. In this paper, efficient feature of lung cancer is identified by Hyper-heuristic. The goal of our method is to improve classification performance and search to identify important feature subsets. Proposed method is compared by most common machine learning feature selection. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes preliminaries of some definition. In Section 3, we explain the proposed method. Finally, experimental results and conclusion are presented in Section 4 and 5, respectively."

      "text" : "Correlation coefficients are one of the simplest approaches to feature relevance measurements. In contrast to information theoretic and decision tree approaches, they avoid problems with probability density estimation and discretization of continuous features and therefore they are treated first [12]. The linear correlation coefficient of Pearson is very popular in statistics and represents the normalized measure of the strength of linear relationship between variables [18]. For random variable X with values x and random variable Y with values y, while a vector of d data points xi ,yi, i = 1,…, d, it is defined as:\n(1)\nWhere, as usual, x is the mean of the xi’s, y is the mean of the yi’s. is equal to ± 1 if X and Y are linearly dependent and zero if they are completely uncorrelated (Random variables may be correlated positively or negatively). If a group of k features has already been existed, correlation coefficients may be used to estimate correlation between this group and the class variable, including inter-correlations between features. Relevance of a group of features grows with the correlation between features and classes, and decreases with growing inter-correlation. These ideas have been discussed in the theory of psychological measurements [19] and in the literature on decision making and aggregating opinions [20]. In 1964, Ghiselli [19] proposed the following equation:\n  \n    , 2 2\n. i i i i\ni x y\ni i i i i j\nx x y y r\nx x y y\n  \n \n\n \n  . 1 cf k ff\nkr J\nk k k r    (2)\nWhere cfr is the average correlation coefficient between these k features and the output variables and the average between different features as ffr . This formula is obtained from Pearson’s correlation coefficient where all variables have been standardized. It has been used in the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm [21]."

Let the feature selection criterion function for the set X be represented by  J X (higher value of J indicates better feature subset). Formally, the problem of feature selection is to find a subset X  F which has the following two important properties:\n m N     J X J N\nIt has been demonstrated that searching for the minimum feature subset is NP-hard [22]."

      "text" : "The proposed method chooses LLHs appropriately by using GA strategies. Since each region of the solution space can have its own characteristics, an appropriate LLH should be selected and applied to the current solution. GA’s role is a supervisor which manages the choice of LLHs that should be applied at any time. GA chooses a LLH based on the existing functional history of LLHs. This GA is not a direct GA, in fact each individual in GA’s population consists of a sequence of integer numbers. Each number is an LLH choice which tells us which LLHmust be applied and each individual tells in which order to apply LLHs. The LLHs perform local searches on current solution to improve it. Local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm. They cooperate in each chromosome by exchanging their local best solutions in order to combine their efforts and to improve the quality of the solutions that each of them would be able to find by itself (working on a standalone basis). Indeed, we use the domain knowledge of the feature selection problem in designing the LLHs to provide more effective search. The local best solutions are the complete set of best solutions found by the LLHs at each chromosome. A set of LLHs consists of two different types of local searches: exploiters LLHs and Explorer LLHs. Exploiters LLHs improve the quality of the candidate solution at hand. The aim of an exploiter is to produce a better candidate solution at each step. They cause to increase exploitation while explorer heuristics are not expected to produce a better candidate solution after they are applied. Explorer heuristics dwell on random perturbation and cause to increase exploration."

This database collected by Hong and Young [29] and indexed in the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository [30]. Experimentalcontentsincludethe extractedfrom the clinical data and X-ray data, etc. It should be noted that the numberof samples givenisfewer than the numberof feature. The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers andall features are nominal, taking an integer value 0-3. Since this dataset has missing values or continues values in uncontrolled ranges, they need a preprocessing step before they are used. For missing values, we replaced them with the most frequently used values for nominal and means of values for numeric features. To control the range of continues features, we normalize them in the range [0, 1]."

Other classifiers like neural networks due to producing different output by changing the initial weights may not be proper for performance comparison.\n k-Fold Cross Validation: It is used to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice and represents the probability that an instance is classified correctly. In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k subsamples. A single subsample is retained as the test data and the remaining k −1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results from the folds then can be averaged to produce a single estimation. In our study, due to being randomness, run 10 times and at each time a 10-fold cross validation which is commonly used [28] is used, and the final results were their average values (10-10 fold CV)."

Crossover rate (Pc) and mutation rate (Pm) is set to 0.7 and 0.1, respectively. Table 1 shows the best and average accuracy of 10 runs of our method on Lung cancer database. Because the proposed method is a random search algorithm, different results may be obtained at different runs. Therefore, we run this algorithm 10 times and report their average. In addition to the accuracy, the number of selected features is also reported. As shown in this table, this number decreases considerably and for low number of features we can see higher accuracy. Our method can achieve these excellent effects in low generations (200). In fact, heuristic algorithms should be run for high generation, e.g. at least 10000, to find global optimum but our method find their results in 200 generations."

This method could search the solution space effectively by incorporating exploration and exploitation appropriately on low generations (200). The proposed method could trade of between exploitation and exploration for the feature selection problem. In this method, exploitation was done by exploiter heuristics and exploration was done by explorer heuristics. In the other words, exploiter heuristics improve the quality of the candidate solution at hand to produce a better candidate solution at each step while explorer heuristics dwell on random perturbation and cause to increase exploration (not necessarily produce a better candidate solution). The proposed method chooses the local searches appropriately by a GA and therefore it could trade of between exploitation and exploration. Moreover, since intensive exploiter can trap the searching algorithm into a local optimum we study on the number of iterations (in the exploiter heuristics) to control this issue. The proposed method compared by 5 most common machine learning algorithms. Their results showed that proposed method had better performance. It obtained an accuracy of 80.63% using reduced 11 feature set."

    "abstractText" : "Background: Lung cancer was known as primary cancers and the survival rate of cancer is about 15%. Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate. All symptoms (features) of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas. It needs an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate. For accurate detection, it need characterizes efficient features and delete redundancy features among all features.Feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features. Materialsand Methods: Lung cancer database consist of 32 patient records with 57 features. This database collected by Hong and Youngand indexed in the University of California Irvine repository. Experimental contents include the extracted from the clinical data and X-ray data, etc. The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers and all features are taking an integer value 0-3. In our study, new method is proposed for identify efficient features of lung cancer. It is based on Hyper-Heuristic. Results:We obtained an accuracy of 80.63% using reduced 11 feature set.The proposed method compare to the accuracy of 5 machine learning feature selections.The accuracy of these 5 methods are 60.94, 57.81, 68.75, 60.94 and 68.75. Conclusions: The proposed method has better performance with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, the proposed model is recommended for identifying an efficient symptom of Disease. These finding are very important in health research, particularly in allocation of medical resources for patients who predicted as high-risks",
