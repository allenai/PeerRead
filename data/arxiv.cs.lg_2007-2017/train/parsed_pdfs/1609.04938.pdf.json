      "text" : "Optical character recognition (OCR) is most commonly used to recognize natural language from an image; however, as early as the work of (Anderson 1967), there has been research interest in converting images into structured language or markup that defines both the text itself and its presentational semantics. The primary focus of this work is OCR for mathematical expressions, and how to handle presentational aspects such as sub and superscript notation, special symbols, and nested fractions (Belaid and Haton 1984; Chan and Yeung 2000). The most effective systems combine specialized character segmentation with grammars of the underlying mathematical layout language (Miller and Viola 1998). A prime example of this approach is the INFTY system that is used to convert printed mathematical expressions to LaTeX and other markup formats (Suzuki et al. 2003).\nProblems like OCR that require joint processing of image and text data have recently seen increased research interest due to the refinement of deep neural models in these two domains. For instance, advances have been made in the areas of\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nhandwriting recognition (Ciresan et al. 2010), OCR in natural scenes (Jaderberg et al. 2015; 2016; Wang et al. 2012) and image caption generation (Karpathy and Fei-Fei 2015; Vinyals et al. 2015b). At a high-level, each of these systems learns an abstract encoded representation of the input image which is then decoded to generate a textual output. In addition to performing quite well on standard tasks, these models are entirely data driven, which makes them adaptable to a wide range of datasets without requiring heavily preprocessing inputs or domain specific engineering.\nThe turn towards data-driven neural methods for image and text leads us to revisit the problem of generating structured markup. We consider whether a supervised model can learn to produce correct presentational markup from an image, without requiring a textual or visual grammar of the underlying markup language. While results from language modeling suggest that neural models can consistently generate syntactically correct markup (Karpathy, Johnson, and Li 2015; Vinyals et al. 2015a), it is unclear whether the full solution can be learned from markup-image pairs.\nOur model, WYGIWYS [What you get is what you see], is a simple extension of the attention-based encoder-decoder model (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which is now standard for machine translation. Similar to work in image captioning (Xu et al. 2015), the model incorporates a multi-layer convolutional network over the image with an attention-based recurrent neural network decoder. To adapt this model to the OCR problem and capture the document’s temporal layout, we also incorporate a new source encoder layer in the form of a multi-row recurrent model applied before the application of attention. The use of attention additionally provides an alignment from the generated markup to the original source image (see Figure 1).\nWe also introduce two new datasets for the image-tomarkup task. The preliminary experiments use a dataset of small synthetic geometric HTML examples rendered as web pages. For the main experiments, we introduce a new dataset, IM2LATEX-100K, that consists of a large collection of rendered real-world mathematical expressions collected from published articles1. We will publicly release this dataset as part of this work. The same model archi-\n1This dataset is based on the challenge originally proposed as an OpenAI Request for Research under the title Im2Latex.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n04 93\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n6 Se\np 20\n16\ntecture is trained to generate HTML and LaTeX markup with the goal rendering to the exact source image. Experiments compare the output of the model with several research and commercial baselines, as well as ablations of the model. The full system for mathematical expression generation is able to match images within 15% of image edit distance, and is identical on more than 75% of realworld test examples. Additionally the use of a multi-row encoder leads to a significant increase in performance. All data, models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available at http://lstm.seas.harvard.edu/latex/.\nProblem: Image-to-Markup Generation We define the image-to-markup problem as converting a rendered source image to target presentational markup that fully describes both its content and layout. The source, x ∈ X , consists of an image with height H and width W , e.g. RH×W for grayscale inputs. The target, y ∈ Y , consists of a sequence of tokens y1, y2, · · · , yC where C is the length of the output, and each y is a token in the markup language with vocabulary Σ. The rendering is defined by a possibly unknown, many-to-one, compile function, compile : Y → X . In practice this function may be quite complicated, e.g a browser, or ill-specified, e.g. the LaTeX language.\nThe supervised task is to learn to approximately invert the compile function using supervised examples of its behavior. We assume that we are given instances (x(1),y(1)), ..., (x(J),y(J)), with possibly differing dimensions H,W,C and that, compile(y) ≈ x, for all training pairs (x,y) (assuming possible noise).\nAt test time, the system is given a raw input x rendered from ground-truth y. It generates a hypothesis ŷ that can then be rendered by the black-box function x̂ = compile(ŷ). Evaluation is done between x̂ and x, i.e. the aim is to produce similar rendered images while ŷ may or may not be similar to the ground-truth markup y."

      "text" : "Our model WYGIWYS for this task combines several standard neural components from vision and natural language\nprocessing. It first extracts image features using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and arranges the features in a grid. Each row is then encoded using a recurrent neural network (RNN). These encoded features are then used by an RNN decoder with a visual attention mechanism. The decoder implements a conditional language model over the vocabulary Σ, and the whole model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the observed markup. The full structure is illustrated in Figure 2. We describe the model in more detail.\nConvolutional Network The visual features of an image are extracted with a multi-layer convolutional neural network interleaved with max-pooling layers. This network architecture is now standard; we model it specifically after the network used by Shi et al. (2015) for OCR from images (specification is given in Table 2.) Unlike some recent OCR work (Jaderberg et al. 2015; Lee and Osindero 2016), we do not use final fully-connected layers (Ioffe and Szegedy 2015), since we want to preserve the locality of CNN features in order to use visual attention. The CNN takes the raw input RH×W and produces a feature grid V of size D×H ′ ×W ′, where c denotes the number of channels and H ′ and W ′ are the reduced sizes from pooling.\nRow Encoder In attention-based image captioning (Xu et al. 2015), the image feature grid can be directly fed into the decoder. For OCR, the visual features fed in to the decoder contain significant relative sequential order information. Therefore we experiment with an additional RNN encoder module that re-encodes each row of the grid. Intuitively, we expect this to help in two ways: (1) many markup languages default to a left-to-right order, which can be easily learned by the encoder, (2) the RNN can utilize the surrounding horizontal context to refine the hidden representation.\nFormally, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is a parameterized function RNN that recursively maps an input vector and a hidden state to a new hidden state. At time t, the hidden state is updated with an input vt in the following manner: ht = RNN(ht−1,vt; θ) and h0 is an initial state. In practice there are many different variants of RNN; however, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and\nSchmidhuber 1997) have been shown to be very effective for most NLP tasks. For simplicity we will describe the model as an RNN, but all experiments use LSTM networks.\nIn this model, the new feature grid Ṽ is created from V by running an RNN across each row of that input. Recursively for all rows h ∈ {1, . . . ,H ′} and columns w ∈ {1, . . . ,W ′}, the new features are defined as Ṽh,w = RNN(Ṽh,w−1,Vh,w). In order to capture the sequential order information in vertical direction, we use a trainable initial hidden state Ṽh,0 for each row, which we name positional embeddings.\nDecoder The target markup tokens {yt} are then generated by a decoder based on a sequence of annotation grid Ṽ. The decoder is trained as a conditional language model to give the probability of the next token given the history and the annotations.\nThis language model is defined on top of a decoder RNN,\np(yt+1|y1, . . . , yt, Ṽ) = softmax(Woutot) where Wout is a learned linear transformation and ot = tanh(Wc[ht; ct]). The vector ht is used to summarize the decoding history: ht = RNN(ht−1, [yt−1;ot−1]). The context vector ct, defined below, is used to capture the context information from the annotation grid.\nAt each time step t, the context vector ct takes into account the annotation grid. However, since most annotation cells are likely irrelevant, the model should know which cells to attend to t. We use an attention model a(·) to model this alignment (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014):\net = a(ht, {Ṽh,w}) αt = softmax(et)\nct = φ({Ṽh,w}, αt)\nwhere αt are the weights calculated based on et, and the weight vector αt and all annotation vectors {Ṽt} are combined to form a context vector ct. Note there are different choices for a and φ, we follow past empirical work and use eit = β T tanh(Whhi−1 + Wvṽt) and ci = ∑\nt αitvt (Luong, Pham, and Manning 2015). The vectors ct and ht are concatenated together to predict the probability of the token yt. Figure 1 shows a real example of the attention distribution αt at each step of the model.\nTraining and Generation The complete model is trained end-to-end to maximize the likelihood of the observed training data. Beyond the training data, the model is given no other information about the markup language or the generating process. To generate markup from unseen images, we simply use beam search at test time with no further hard constraints."

This dataset provides a much more difficult test-bed for learning how to reproduce naturally occurring markup.\nCorpus The IM2LATEX-100K dataset provides 103,556 different LaTeX math equations along with rendered pictures. We extract formulas by parsing LaTeX sources of papers from the arXiv. LaTeX sources are obtained from tasks I and II of the 2003 KDD cup (Gehrke, Ginsparg, and Kleinberg 2003) containing over 60,000 papers.\nTo extract formulas from the LaTex sources, we match the Latex sources with simple regular expressions, namely \\begin{equation} (.*?) \\end{equation}, $$ (.*?) $$, \\[ (.*?) \\] and \\( (.*?) \\). We only keep matches whose total number of characters fall in the range from 40 to 1024 to avoid single symbols, large matrices or text sentences. With these settings we extract over 800,000 different LaTeX formulas. Out of the remaining formulas, around 100 thousand are rendered in a vanilla LaTex environment. Rendering is fulfilled with pdflatex3 and formulas that fail to compile are excluded. Then the rendered PDF files are converted to PNG format4. The final dataset we provide contains 103,556 images of resolution 1654 × 2339 with black equations against transparent background, and the corresponding LaTeX formulas.\nThe dataset is separated into training set (83,883 equations), validation set (9,319 equations) and test set (10,354 equations) for standardized experiment setup. The LaTeX formulas range from 38 to 997 characters with mean 118 and median 98.\nTokenization Training the model requires settling on a token set Σ. One option is to use a purely characterbased model. While this method requires fewer assumptions, character-based NMT models have been less effective, slower, and significantly more memory intensive than wordbased models. Therefore original markup is simply split into\n3LaTeX (version 3.1415926-2.5-1.40.14) 4We use the ImageMagick convert tool with parameters\n-density 200 -quality 100\nminimal meaningful LaTeX tokens, e.g. for observed characters, symbols such as \\sigma, modifier characters such as ˆ, functions, accents, environments, brackets and other miscellaneous commands.\nOptional: Normalization Finally we note that naturally occurring LaTeX contains many different expressions that produce identical output. We therefore experiment with an optional normalization preprocessing step to eliminate spurious ambiguity (prior to training). For normalization, we wrote a LaTeX parser5 to convert the markup to an abstract syntax tree. We then apply a set of safe normalizing tree transformation to eliminate common spurious ambiguity, shown in Table 1. Note this only changes the training data, and does not change the model itself."

However we found that this system performed too poorly on this task to compare.\nFor a neural model, a natural comparison is to standard image captioning approaches (Xu et al. 2015). As our model is based on this approach, we compare by removing the encoder RNN, i.e. replacing Ṽ with V, and increasing the number of CNN such that the number of parameters is approximately the same. We name this mode textscCNNEnc.\nWe also run experiments comparing the model to traditional LM approaches, including a standard NGRAM model (5-gram trained with Kneser-Ney smoothing) and an LSTM-LM.

Additionally we check the exact match accuracy with the original image as well as the value after eliminating whitespace columns.6 We also include standard intrinsic text generation metrics, conditional language model perplexity and BLEU score (Papineni et al. 2002).

These results indicate that the model is able to learn to identify and generate the correct output based on spatial cues. Much of the remaining perplexity is due to ambiguities in the underlying markup language. Typical mistakes are shown in Table 4. The few issues occur in font-size and matching relative sizes of divs.\nThe main experimental results on mathematical expressions are given in Table 3. These results compare several different systems on the task of decompiling rendered LaTeX. The classical INFTY system is able to do quite well in terms of text accuracy, but performs poorly on the more rigorous image metrics. Our reimplementation of the Imageto-Caption work CNNENC does much better, pushing that number to above 50%. Our full system with RNN encoder increases this value above 75%, achieving very high accuracy on this task. We expected the LaTeX normalizer to greatly increase performance, but only give a few points of accuracy gain, despite achieving high normalized BLEU. This indicates that the decoder LM is able to learn well despite the ambiguities in real-world LaTeX.\nTo better understand the contribution of each part of the model, we run ablation experiments removing different aspects, which are shown in Table 5. The simplest model is a standard NGRAM LM on LaTeX with a perplexity of around 8. Simply switching to an LSTM-LM reduces the value to 5, likely due to its ability to count parentheses and nestinglevels. Adding the image data with a CNN further reduces the perplexity down to 1.18. Adding the encoder LSTM adds a small gain to 1.12, but actually makes a large difference in final accuracy. Adding the positional embeddings (trainable initial states for each row) adds a tiny gain.\nThe main non-spacing errors of the model are shown in Table 6.

While this task is a wellstudied problem in OCR, our method takes an inherently different, data-driven approach. Our model does not require any knowledge of the underlying markup language, and is simply trained end-to-end on real-world example data. The model employs a convolutional network for text and layout recognition in tandem with an attention-based neural machine translation system. To train and evaluate the model, we introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup, as well as a synthetic dataset of web pages paired with HTML snippets. Experimental results show that the system is surprisingly effective at generating accurate markup for both datasets. While a standard domainspecific LaTeX OCR system achieves around 25% accuracy, our model reproduces the exact rendered image on 75% of examples.",
