INTRODUCTION\nA cognitive radio network (CRN) is composed of two types of users, namely, the licensed primary users (PU’s) and the unlicensed secondary users (SU’s). The core idea behind CR is to allow unlicensed user’s access to the licensed bands in an opportunistic manner to avoid interference with the licensed users. To achieve this, a realistic understanding of the dynamic usage of the spectrum is required. The spectrum measurement is an important step towards the realistic understanding of the dynamic spectrum usage. Various spectrum measurement campaigns covering a wide range of frequencies have been performed [1]. These pectrum measurements studies have found significant amount of unused frequency bands in the case of normal usage due to the static spectrum regulations. This has led researchers to understand the spectrum occupancy characteristics in depth for exploiting the free spectrum."

      "text" : "Many studies have been performed to understand the occupancy statistics. For instance, the statistical and spectral occupation analysis of the measurements was presented in [2] in order to study the traffic density in all frequency bands. In [3], autoregressive model was used to predict the radio resource availability using occupancy measurements in order to achieve uninterrupted data transmission of secondary users. In [4], the occupancy statistics were utilized to select the best channels for control and data transmission purposes, so that less time is required for switching transmission from one channel to the other for the case when the PU appears. Further, In [5], [6], the bandwidth efficiency was maximized by controlling the transmission power of cognitive radio using spectrum occupancy measurements.\nIn [7], different time series models were used to categorize specific occupancy patterns in the spectrum measurements. All of the aforementioned works have evaluated the spectrum occupancy models by using conventional probabilistic or statistical tools. These tools are often limited due to assumptions required to derive their theories. For example, one has to determine whether the value is random variable or a random process in order to use either probabilistic and statistical\nMarch 25, 2015 DRAFT\n2 tools. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) is a very powerful tool that has received increasing attention recently [8]. The machine learning algorithms are often heuristic, as they don’t have any prerequisites or assumptions on data. As a result, in many cases, they provide higher accuracy than conventional probabilistic and statistical tools. There are very few works on the use of ML in spectrum occupancy. For example, the ML works related to CR in [9]- [13] discussed cooperative spectrum sensing and spectrum occupancy variation. However, in this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive investigation on the use of ML for analyzing spectrum occupancy. The motivation is that different ML algorithms are often suitable for different types of data. Thus, one needs to try different ML algorithms in order to find the one that suits the spectrum data best, not just one ML algorithm."

      "text" : "The contributions are listed as follows:\n1. We propose the use of ML algorithms in spectrum occupancy study. Both supervised and unsupervised algorithms are used. The machine learning techniques are advantageous because they are capable of implicitly learning the surrounding environment and are much more adaptive compared with the traditional spectrum occupancy models. They can describe more optimized decision regions on feature space than other approaches. In [9] and [10], ML was used for cooperative spectrum sensing. However we use ML for spectrum occupancy modelling that may be used in all CR operations, including spectrum management, spectrum decision and spectrum sensing. In [11], authors have discussed call-based modelling for analyzing the spectrum usage of the dataset collected from the cellular network operator. Further, they have shown that random walk process can be used for modeling aggregate cell capacity. However, we use ML to model spectrum occupancy in time slots for all important bands. 2. We have utilized four supervised algorithms, naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR), and one unsupervised algorithm, hidden markov model (HMM), to classify the occupancy status of time slots. The classified\nMarch 25, 2015 DRAFT\n3 occupancy status is further utilized for evaluating the probability of SU outage. In [12], HMM was used to predict the channel status. Our supervised algorithms and modified HMM all perform better than HMM. In [13], LR was used to investigate the spectrum occupancy variation in time and frequency. Our approach outperforms LR as well.\n3. We propose a new technique that combines SVM with fire fly algorithm (FFA) that\noutperforms all supervised and unsupervised algorithms.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II explains the system model, followed by the detailed explanation of classifiers in Section III.

Thus, NBC is the best considering the accuracy and complexity.\n2) Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms using K = 192 : We have compared HMM, Trained HMM, SVM, DT and NBC in Fig.6(b) for 30 days. Each iteration represents 1 day. LR is not shown as it takes an excessively long time in this case. It is observed that trained HMM performed better than HMM, but worst than DT, NBC and SVM. The mean CA attained by Trained HMM, HMM, SVM, DT and NBC is 0.6816, 0.4887, 0.8528, 0.8392, 0.7970 while the computational time for each iteration of Trained HMM, HMM, SVM, DT and NBC 0.0205,\nMarch 25, 2015 DRAFT\n15\n0.09066, 0.0135, 0.0163, 0.0095 seconds, respectively. Thus, SVM is the best in this case with highest CA and shortest time.\n3) SVM with Fire Fly Algorithm : So far, the best overall performance is attained by the linear SVM technique. The performance of linear SVM is affected by the value of Boxct as illustrated in Section IV-C. The fire fly algorithm can be used to select the best value of Boxct. We set α = 1, β0 = 2 and ψl1l2 = 1.3 for FFA. Fig. 7(a) depicts that ’SVM+FFA’ performs better than the conventional SVM in most of the cases. The mean CA attained by SVM+FFA, SVM, DT, NBC and HMM is 0.8728, 0.8499, 0.7970, 0.8392 and 0.4822, respectively.\n4) Probability of SU Outage: This probability is computed using SVM+FFA, SVM, DT, NBC and HMM and compared with the expected P (SUoutage) to compute the difference between evaluated and expected values. It is evident in Fig. 7(b) that SVM+FFA has predicted the P (SUoutage) with minimum difference and is very close to the expected one. The expected SU outage is 0.9191 in Fig. 7(b) while the predicted P (SUoutage) using SVM+FFA, SVM, NBC, DT and HMM is 0.9264, 0.9322, 0.9638, 0.9577 and 1, respectively. The P (SUoutage) for HMM is always 1, which implies that HMM has failed to find any block of consecutive free time slot of length outsu.\n5) Supervised vs Unsupervised Algorithms using different Training/ Testing Data vectors:\nWe have presented the detailed comparison of supervised and unsupervised algorithms using different sizes of training and testing data Table 1. The classification accuracy and computation time for all supervised algorithms increases with an increase in the size of the training data. SVM+FFA has attained the highest CA but with the longest computation time in most cases."

Both supervised techniques (naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision trees (DT), support vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR)) and unsupervised algorithm (hidden markov model (HMM)) are studied to find the best technique with the highest classification accuracy (CA). A detailed comparison of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms in terms of the computational time and classification accuracy is performed. The classified occupancy status is further utilized to evaluate the probability of secondary user outage for the future time slots, which can be used by system designers to define spectrum allocation and spectrum sharing policies. Numerical results show that SVM is the best algorithm among all the supervised and unsupervised classifiers. Based on this, we proposed a new SVM algorithm by combining it with fire fly algorithm (FFA), which is shown to outperform all other algorithms.
