      "text" : "A Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is a special type of Teachable Agent which incorporates a persuasion theory in order to provide persuasive and more personalized feedback to the student. By employing the persuasion techniques, the PTA seeks to maintain the student in a high motivation and high ability state in which he or she has higher cognitive ability and his or her changes in attitudes are more persistent. However, the existing model of the PTA still has a few limitations. Firstly, the existing PTA model focuses on modelling the PTA’s ability to persuade, while does not model its ability to be taught by the student and to practice the knowledge it has learnt. Secondly, the quantitative model for computational processes in the PTA has low reusability. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of the PTA.\nTo address these three limitations, this project proposes an improved agent model which follows a goal-oriented approach and models the PTA in its totality by integrating the Persuasion Reasoning of the PTA with the Teachability Reasoning and the Practicability Reasoning. The project also proposes a more abstract and generalized quantitative model for the computations in the PTA. With higher level of abstraction, the reusability of the quantitative model is also improved. New system architecture is introduced to bridge the gap between theoretical models and implementation of the PTA.\nAn instance of the PTA is also implemented and embedded into a 3D pedagogical game called VS Saga to demonstrate the practice of instantiating a PTA from the proposed agent model and system architecture. A focus group study has been conduct to assess the PTA qualitatively. The results of the focus group study are quite positive, showing the PTA has the ability to motivate and engage the student by generating personalized feedback and the potential to help the student develop positive attitudes towards learning. Positive feedback has also been received for the completeness of the new agent model and the reusability of the proposed system architecture. As for future studies, quantitative assessment of the PTA still needs to be carried out in order to analyze the\neffectiveness of the PTA statistically. The PTA also needs to build up its flexibility to cater to different learning topics.\nChapter 1 Introduction to Persuasive Teachable"

      "text" : "Teachable Agents (TAs) are educational agents which have emerged from the interdisciplinary research in education, computer science and psychology. The design and development of a Teachable Agent is enlightened by the Learning-byTeaching pedagogy which entails learning by teaching others [1]. The TA plays the role of a tutee which requires tutoring from the student. During the process of teaching the agent tutee, the student can enhance his or her comprehension and reflection of content knowledge, acquire inquiry skills and stay motivated due to his or her sense of responsibility towards the agent tutee [2].\nIn order to harness the benefits of Learning-by-Teaching, researchers have designed various TAs, such as Betty’s Brain [3] and SimStudent [4]. However, these TAs generally lack of the ability to interact with the student spontaneously and maintain the student’s attention. They are also generally incapable of giving personalized responses or feedback to their student tutors. More recently, attempts have been made to improve on these drawbacks. Affective Teachable Agent improves TA’s spontaneity and believability by incorporating goal orientation feature and generating emotional responses according to the student’s teaching [5]. Dynalearn is another project which improves TA’s ability to generate feedback and recommendations by making use of a qualitative reasoning model [6]. Most of the aforementioned TAs would provide feedback to the student based on their learning outcome. There are two limitations with learning with these TAs: (1) the student may not have mastered the topic himself or herself when teaching; (2) the student is not fully motivated to teach the TA.\nA Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is a special TA which has the ability to be taught, to practice knowledge learnt and to persuade the student to teach it [20]. Taking a different approach from the aforementioned attempts, a PTA seeks to induce long lasting attitude changes of the student towards learning by incorporating a persuasion theory [2]. It also seeks to improve TA’s responsiveness and the quality of feedback generated. According to the PTA model that Lim has proposed in her study [20], the motivation and ability level of the student is tracked and measured constantly while he or she is interacting with and teaching the PTA. The PTA generates appropriate and personalized persuasion cues based on the student’s measured motivation and ability level, in order to maintain the student in a state in which he or she has higher cognitive ability and his or her changes in attitudes are more persistent [2].\nThe PTA addresses several issues of previous TAs, including lack of spontaneity and personalized feedback. However, it still has a few limitations. Firstly, the PTA model focuses on modelling PTA’s ability to persuade, while does not model its ability to be taught and to practice. Secondly, the quantitative model for computational processes in the PTA is difficult to reuse. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of PTA. This project looks into these limitations, and aims to address them.\nWith the rise of consumer games on various devices, including PCs, smartphones and tablets, pedagogical games are also gaining popularity. Researches have suggested that videogames could become powerful learning tools which could be adapted to incorporate different curriculums [7]. Videogames create immersive learning environments with appealing video and audio effects and most of them are created in 2D or 3D environments. Studies on pedagogical videogames indicate that they can help the student master content knowledge [8] and acquire practical skills [9]. Besides, the virtual environments in videogames provide a digital learning ambience in which various types of student behavioral data can be tracked and recorded.\nTeachable Agents can also be embedded into pedagogical videogames [10]. TAs appear in the gaming environment as avatars which are capable of interacting with students and performing actions [11]. Based on the student’s behavioral data collected in virtual gaming environments, videogames enable the embedded TAs to provide more immediate and interactive feedback to the student. More specifically, in terms of Persuasive Teachable Agents, collected data can also be used to direct the selection of appropriate persuasion strategies.\nAs mentioned before, the existing PTA model still has a few limitations. This project aims to address the limitations by:\n(1) Redefining a PTA agent model that depicts PTA’s ability to persuade,\nintegrated with its ability to learn and to practice\n(2) Proposing an improved quantitative model for computational processes\nin PTA\n(3) Introducing system architecture to guide PTA implementation.\nConsidering the favorable effects that educational games and virtual environments have on learning, an instance of the PTA is also implemented and embedded into a pedagogical game in 3D virtual environment. This instance can be used subsequently for the assessment and evaluation of the PTA."

The existing model focuses on depicting the PTA’s ability to persuade, but does not describe the PTA’s ability to be taught and to practice.\n(2) The quantitative model in Persuasion Reasoning of PTA is difficult to reuse.

      "text" : "The idea of Teachable Agent (TA) is inspired by the Learning-by-Teaching pedagogy which entails learning by teaching others [1]. During a peer tutoring program, Gaustard found that student tutors usually benefited more or at least the same as their peer tutees [12]. With the development of artificial intelligence, the TA is developed to take the role of a tutee and can be taught by students.\nGenerally, the TA facilitates and benefits learning process from the following three perspectives [11]: (1) helping students structure and organize their knowledge; (2) invoking students’ sense of responsibility towards teaching and their own learning; and (3) enhancing students’ knowledge reflection and metacognition.\nDuring the recent two decades, TA has been an active research area. Researchers have developed various TAs for different purposes and curriculums in various formats.\nBetty’s Brain is an agent developed to facilitate the learning of middle school natural science topics [3]. The student can teach Betty by completing concept maps. Concept maps help the student to structure and reorganize his or her knowledge while teaching. The student is able to assess Betty’s learning by querying Betty or put her through a quiz and observe the answers or the quiz outcome.\nSimStudent is another TA which simulates a classroom learner and can be taught in the domain of mathematics [4]. SimStudent is able to learn cognitive skills from the student by analyzing his or her inputs. The student tutors the agent by solving an algebraic equation collaboratively with the agent in a stepwise fashion. A test can be used to assess SimStudent’s learning performance after tutoring.\nHowever, both Betty’s Brain and SimStudent interact with students passively and are incapable of giving personalized feedback. Affective Teachable Agent is\nintroduced to improve the spontaneity and believability of the TA [5]. Affective Teachable Agent has incorporated goal-orientation feature. While pursuing its predefined goals, the agent is able to take spontaneous actions to interact with the student. The agent has also employed affective computing by simulating emotions to build an emotional tie with the student.\nDynaLearn is an agent designed to facilitate the learning of conceptual knowledge in science subjects. The student teaches the agent by creating conceptual models in a graphical editor. The agent goes through qualitative reasoning to generate feedback and recommendations to the student. Similar to Affective Teachable Agent, DynaLearn also simulates simple emotions to bind the student and the agent.\nEach of the four aforementioned attempts has made their own innovations to improve learning experiences. However, they also have their own drawbacks. A summary of these TAs are presented in Table 2.1 below."

      "text" : "Even for the improved TA models such as Affective Teachable Agent and DynaLearn, there are still two issues with learning with TAs [20]:\n(1) Students may not have mastered the topic themselves when teaching the TA. This may cause the student to commit errors while teaching. In this situation, it is hard to give constructive feedback by solely referring to the TA’s learning performance. It is crucial to understand the student’s ability, i.e. how much he or she knows by the time he or she teaches, in order to give adequate feedback. (2) Students are not fully engaged in teaching the TA. In order to harness full benefits of Learning-by-Teaching, the student needs to actively engage in teaching. However, it is hard to keep the student motivated all the time, especially when the TA is passive in interactions and incapable of giving personalized responses. Thus, it is important to monitor the student’s motivation level and generate corresponding feedback.\nTo address these two issues that most existing TAs have, an improved TA model should have the ability to provide responses and feedback based on the student’s ability and motivation, which ensures that the student possesses necessary ability required for teaching the topic and is constantly motivated to teach."

      "text" : "A Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA) is a special TA which has the ability to be taught, to practice and to persuade the student to teach it. Persuasion is a kind of interaction between human beings, which aims to influence others by changing their attitudes [13]. Originated from the psychology and the communications domain, persuasion theories have increasing applications in the human computer interaction domain, in the attempt to induce attitude changes of human beings. The PTA seeks to induce long lasting attitude changes of students towards learning by incorporating a persuasion theory [2].\nThe persuasion theory that has enlightened the idea of the PTA is the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). The ELM is a dualistic model, which states that there are two routes of persuasion, namely the central route and the peripheral route [14]. According to the ELM, one is more willing to go through complicated cognitive processes if he or she is motivated and possesses the necessary abilities required to perform a behavior. After deep cognitive processes, one is likely to go through the central route of persuasion where his or her attitude changes tend to be enduring. On the contrary, one would avoid complicated cognitive processes if he or she is not motivated or does not possess the necessary abilities. Without any deep consideration, one is likely to go through the peripheral route of persuasion where the resulting attitude changes tend to be less enduring.\nPTA has two major characteristics:\n(1) Goal-orientation. Similar to Affective Teachable Agent [5], the PTA is goaloriented. The primary goal of the PTA is to keep students on the central route of persuasion, so that their positive attitude changes towards learning and the knowledge they obtained could be more enduring. The PTA acts towards its goal by persuasion. (2) Ability to persuade. The student’s motivation and ability level are tracked and measured constantly while he or she is interacting with and teaching the PTA. According the ELM, when the student is not motivate or does not possess the abilities required to teach the PTA, he or she is likely to go through the peripheral route of persuasion. In this situation, the PTA generates appropriate and personalized persuasion cues to direct the student back on to the central route.\nWith its goal-orientation and persuasion features, the PTA is able to provide immediate and personalized feedback based on the student’s ability and motivation, which previous TAs are incapable of.\nIn her study, Lim has propose a PTA model [2], as shown in Figure 2.1. The PTA receives environment data from the Event Tracker and performs onto its environment by carrying out actions. The Knowledge Base stores the knowledge the PTA has obtained from its student tutor.\nThe Teachability Reasoning has two cycles, the learning cycle and the reasoning cycle. In this two cycles, the PTA learns from the student tutor and responds to his or her inquiries respectively.\nThe Persuasion Reasoning determines the student tutor’s motivation and ability level according to the ELM and Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) [15]. The Persuasion Reasoning is modelled based on Goal Net [16], a methodology for modelling goal-oriented agents.\nHowever, as mentioned before, the existing PTA model still has a few limitations. After reviewing the existing PTA model, these limitations can be described more specifically as below:\n(1) Persuasion Reasoning of PTA is not integrated with Teachability and Practicability Reasoning. The existing agent model has only proposed the Goal Net model for the Persuasion Reasoning while does not have Goal Net models for the Teachability Reasoning and the Practicability Reasoning.\n(2) The quantitative model in Persuasion Reasoning of PTA is difficult to reuse. Existing PTA model employs a fuzzy tool, Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), to model the computational processes in Persuasion Reasoning. However, the\nquantitative FCM model is highly context dependent thus difficult to be reused in a different context.\n(3) Gap between theoretical models and practical implementation. The agent model has a high level of abstraction. It is hard to directly instantiate a PTA from the existing PTA model. Thus, another layer of design is needed between the agent model and implementation, which can provide more detailed guidelines for the implementation of PTA.\nTo address these three limitations, firstly, a complete agent model has to be proposed. A complete agent model should include not only the Goal Net modelling for the Persuasion Reasoning, but also Goal Net modellings for the Teachability and Practicability Reasoning. Secondly, a more abstract and generalized FCM model is required for the quantitative processes in the PTA. Thirdly, the gap between theoretical models and implementation of the PTA should also be bridged. In order to assess and evaluate the PTA, an instance of the PTA also needs to be implemented."

Games, especially video games, are highly engaging and are good at content delivering due to their appealing audio and video effects. Studies on pedagogical videogames indicate that they can help students master content knowledge [8] and acquire practical skills [9].\nMost videogames are deployed in 2D or 3D environments. River City is a multiuser 3D virtual environment built by Chris Dede’s group at Harvard University to facilitate learning in the science domain [17]. After two weeks, the group of students who played in River City improved their content knowledge and inquiry skills by a greater extent compared to the control group which followed the normal paper-based curriculum.\nTeachable Agents can also be embedded into pedagogical videogames [10]. TAs appear in the gaming environment as avatars which are capable of interacting with students and performing actions [11]. Affective Teachable Agent has been deployed in the 3D virtual educational game, Virtual Singapura. Based on the student’s behavioral data collected in virtual gaming environment, Affective Teachable Agent is capable of providing appropriate emotional responses to the student. The assessment Affective Teachable Agent has proved its effectiveness not only in improving students’ learning outcome, but also in motivating students and fostering their self-efficacy [11].\nTo harness the benefits of educational games and virtual environments, an instance of the PTA is implemented and embedded into a 3D pedagogical game called VS Saga.

      "text" : "Goal Net methodology is well-suited for modelling goal-oriented agents. Since goal-orientation is one of the major characteristics of the PTA, Goal Net would be a suitable methodology to model the PTA.\nGoal Net methodology is first proposed by Dr. Shen in 2005 [16] to model goaloriented agents. In Goal Net, an agent pursues its goal by completing a sequence of sub-goals. A Goal Net can be composed from four basic entities: states, transitions, arcs and branches.\nStates are used to represent the goals of an agent. A state can be atomic or composite. A composite state can be further broken down into multiple atomic states. These atomic states represent the sub-goals that need to be fulfilled in order to fulfill the goal denoted by the composite state. States are represented by a round node in Goal Nets.\nTransitions are the tasks that advance the agent from an input state to an output state. Each transition has an associate task list, which describes the tasks need to be completed in order to trigger this transition. Once all the tasks are completed, the transitions triggers and the agent advances from input state to output state. There are three types of transitions (as shown in Figure 3.2):\nDirect Transition The task list of such transitions is fixed and not changing according to runtime environment. The transition is triggered by completing same list of tasks every time.\nConditional Transition The tasks needed to be completed to trigger a conditional transition is selected dynamically during runtime.\nProbabilistic Transition The tasks needed to be completed to trigger a probabilistic transition is selected dynamically based on probabilistic inference in an uncertain environment.\nArcs connect states and transitions and indicate the relationships between the nodes it connect. An arc can be represented by a triangle arrow or a diamond arrow.\nBranches are used to denote composite states. Two branches connect a composite state to the sequence of sub-states that compose it. The left branch connects to the first sub-state of this composite state while right branch connected to the last sub-state.\nFigure 3.3 shows an example of a Goal Net which contains all the four basic entities. S denotes states, while T denotes transitions.\nFigure 3.3 A Goal Net Example"

      "text" : "The persuasion theory that forms the basis of the Persuasion Reasoning is the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM).\nThe Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion is a dualistic model developed by Petty and Cacioppo in 1986. The ELM proposed an underlying framework for persuasion communication and the resulting attitude changes. Elaboration in the ELM refers to the process which the recipient of the persuasive message engages in cognitive thinking related to the persuasion topic. Various factors that can affect the likelihood of elaboration can be classified into\ntwo large categories: motivation of the message recipient and his or her ability to elaborate.\nAccording to the ELM, there are two routes of persuasion, the central route and the peripheral route [14], as shown in Figure 3.5. The likelihood of elaboration determines which route the message recipient would go through. The likelihood of elaboration increases if one is motivated and has the ability to engage in elaboration. In this situation, one is likely to go through the central route of persuasion where his or her attitude changes tend to be enduring. On the contrary, the likelihood of elaboration decreases if one is not motivated or does not have ability to elaborate. In this situation, one is likely to go through the peripheral route of persuasion where the resulting attitude changes tend to be less enduring.\nThe following are the factors [14] that can affect the likelihood of elaboration explained in the context of PTA, arranged according to the categories they belong to.\nCategory 1: Motivation. Motivation can be assessed from following factors:\n(1) Personal Relevance. How relevant the event is to the learning topics. (2) Personal Responsibility. Whether the event demonstrates the student’s responsibility towards his or her own learning. (3) Need for Cognition. Whether the student enjoys the learning process. When the learning process is enjoyable, the student would be more willing to engage in cognitive thinking.\nCategory 2: Ability. Ability can be assessed from following factors:\n(1) Prior Knowledge. Whether the student has acquired the necessary knowledge required to teach the PTA. (2) Distraction. Whether the event is a distractor and would decrease the student’s ability. (3) Repetition. Whether the student is revisiting the knowledge he or she has acquired by teaching the PTA.\nThe PTA has incorporated the ELM to achieve its goal of instilling enduring positive attitude changes and knowledge gains of the student, i.e. keep him or her on the central route of persuasion. By assessing the six factors mentioned above, the PTA can evaluate the motivation and ability level of the student and generate appropriate persuasion cue if the student is in low motivation or low ability state."

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Quantitative Model for Assessing Motivation and Ability – FCM",
      "text" : "As mentioned above, the PTA needs to determine the motivation and ability level of the student in order to generate appropriate response. FCM can be applied to build a quantitative model to derive the values of motivation and ability from the values of their respective constituent factors.\nFuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) [15] is a fuzzy tool which can be used to depict causal relationships in dynamic systems. FCM is a graphical representation, at the same time, also a mathematical model of the dynamic system it is modelling.\nA FCM is composed of causal concepts and causal relationships. A causal concept can be used to model an event, a goal or an action. It is represented by a rounded node in FCM and has a real number value in interval [-1, 1]. A set of causal concepts are interconnected by directed edges. Each directed edge represents the causal relationship between two causal concepts. A causal relationship with a positive sign “+” denotes casual increase, while one with a negative sign “-” denotes causal decrease. A causal relationship can have a weight associated with it to denote the strength of the cause-effect relationship it represents. The weight usually takes a real value in interval [-1, 1].\nFigure 3.6 shows a simple FCM example. The FCM in Figure 3.6(a) can also be represented as a matrix (denoted by E) in Figure 3.6(b). The weight of causal relationship from Ci to Cj is the value at Eij. For example, the weight of causal relationship from C2 to C4 is -1, which means C2 decreases C4.\nIn the context of a PTA, FCM can be applied to build a quantitative model to derive the values of motivation and ability from the values of their respective constituent factors. A FCM model proposed for the PTA is shown in Figure 3.7. This FCM model depicts the causal relationship among motivation, ability and factors affect them.\nDefinition 5: A stem node is a causal concept that is:\n(1) Peripheral Cue or; (2) Motivation or; (3) Ability or; (4) A factor of motivation or ability.\nAll PTA FCMs have the same stem nodes.\nDefinition 6: A leaf node is a causal concept that is not a stem node and has a causal relationship with one of the factors of motivation or ability.\nLeaf nodes model the events that have causal relationships with the motivation or ability factors. Thus, the type and number of leaf nodes differ from one PTA implementation to another.\nMultiple leaf nodes can be connected to a motivation or ability factor. The same leaf node can also be connected to multiple factors. A leaf node is denoted by a rounded node with dotted rim in Figure 3.7.\nDefinition 7: the Main FCM is the FCM formed by all the stem nodes.\nIn Figure 3.7, all the nodes with solid rim form the Main FCM.\nDefinition 8: a Sub FCM is a FCM formed by a stem node and all the leaf nodes that are connected to it.\nIn the PTA FCM, there are six Sub FCMs, each formed around a factor of motivation or ability.\nWith the proposed PTA FCM model and the above definitions, the computational processes in the Persuasion Reasoning can be designed with greater flexibility and implemented with greater computational efficiency. An implementation of the proposed PTA FCM model is described in section 5.2.4."

Secondly, the agent determines whether the resultant motivation and ability values are high or low by comparing them to the pre-determined\nbaseline values.

However, since the agent model has a high level of abstraction, there is still a gap between this theoretical model and the implementation of the PTA. In order to provide more guidelines for implementation, new system architecture for the PTA is proposed in this chapter.\nThe proposed system architecture (as shown in Figure 4.1) focuses on the design of the agent’s control structure. The system architecture retains certain level of abstraction and is reusable as:\n(1) It is independent of the learning topics, the deployment environment and the form of embodiment of the PTA; (2) It guides, but does not restrict the way of implementing a PTA.\nAt the highest level, the Goal Net Interpreter directs the goal-oriented behaviors of a PTA according to its Goal Net models. It determines the next state of the PTA and the tasks to be performed in order to advance to the next state. The Goal Net Interpreter instructs the PTA Control component to carry out the tasks required. The PTA control is supported by a number of other control components.

As shown in Figure 4.2, the proposed Goal Net models of the PTA can be created by drawing using a graphical Goal Net Designer [18] and saved into the Goal Net database. Please\nrefer to Appendix 2 for the complete Goal Net model drawn in a Goal Net Designer.\nThe Goal Net Interpreter loads the Goal Net models from the database during runtime and interprets them dynamically. It determines the next state of the PTA by traversing through the nodes in the PTA’s Goal Net. During a state transition, the Goal Net Interpreter also determines the tasks the PTA should perform in order to pursue its goal.\nAfter determining the tasks to be performed, the Goal Net Interpreter instructs the PTA Control to perform those tasks. After finishing the designated tasks, the PTA Control informs the Goal Net Interpreter to proceed to the next state.\nThere are two possible ways to implement the Goal Net Interpreter: to make use of an existing Goal Net interpreter or to build a new one.\nAlternative 1: Make use of an existing Goal Net interpreter. MADE Runtime [18] is a virtual machine that interprets the Goal Net models. It loads the Goal Net designs from the database using a Goal Net loader (as shown in Figure 4.3) and traverses through the Goal Net. Whenever a task needs to be performed to fire a state transition, MADE Runtime will invoke the corresponding routine. In this case, MADE Runtime is running as an active component and the system\narchitecture would be different from what is described in Figure 4.1. The system architecture using MADE Runtime is shown in Figure 4.4.\nAlternative 2: Build a new Goal Net Interpreter. The most direct way to build a new Goal Net Interpreter is to directly access the Goal Net database. Goal Net database stores the information of states, transitions, task lists and functions. A Goal Net Interpreter can be implemented by querying the above information directly to determine the next state of the PTA and the tasks to be performed. Figure 4.5 shows the logic of how the Goal Net Interpreter pursues the goal of the agent.

The implemented Goal Net Interpreter directly accesses the Goal Net database using the interface provided by the Database Access Component.\nThe Goal Net Interpreter advances from an input state to an output state by firing the transition that connects them. However, when it encounters a decision node for which one input state has multiple possible output states, it needs to decide which output state to move to. To resolve that issue, a decision table is implemented in the PTA Control component (as shown in Figure 5.5) which keeps the decision to be made at each decision node. The PTA Control updates this decision table according reasoning results and current percepts. The Goal Net Interpreter refers to the decision table for deciding the output state if a decision node is encountered.\nFigure 5.4(b) Concept Map\n2.

      "text" : "The PTA Control has implemented the task functions in Table 4.2. This section provides summaries of how these functions are implemented in the context of VS Saga.\nMain Routine. During the execution of the PTA’s Main Routine, the PTA Control calls the Event Control component every 5 seconds to check for events until one or more events are detected. Then, it prioritizes the events and decides the ones to be processed in the current cycle. It determines which the reasoning cycle the event(s) should go through and updates the decision table.\nPersuasion Reasoning. During the execution of the sub Goal Net “To Persuade”, the PTA Control calls the FCM Calculation component to calculate the value of motivation and ability based on current percepts (events). Then, it\ncompares the resultant values to the baselines values to determine whether the student is in low motivation or low ability state where persuasion is needed. It updates the decision table accordingly. When persuasion is needed, the PTA Control selects a suitable cue according to the attributes of the event(s). Lastly, the PTA Control calls the UI Control to display the selected persuasion cue (an example in Figure 5.7).\nTeachability Reasoning. As shown in Figure 5.4(b), the teaching process is mainly performed on a UI called Concept Map [19], which shows the relationships between the key concepts of the learning topic. The water molecule requests teaching from the student during a dialogue, as shown in Figure 5.8. If the student agrees to teach the water molecule, the PTA Control will display the concept map. After teaching process finishes, the knowledge taught by the student will be stored within the script of the concept map. If the student refuses to teach the water molecule, the PTA control will generate a rejection event.\nPracticability Reasoning. During the execution of the sub Goal Net “To Practice Knowledge Learnt”, the PTA Control reasons the correctness of the teaching based on the knowledge stored in the concept map. If the teaching of the student is correct, the PTA Control will invoke the animation of the banana tree so the tree becomes revitalized as shown in 5.13. Otherwise, the PTA Control will generate a wrong solution event."

      "text" : "In VS Saga, the Event Control component mainly tracks and deals with three types of events in Table 4.3: dialogue events, time events and teaching feedback events.\nDialogue Events. A dialogue event is an event created when a particular sentence in a dialogue has been spoken. A dialogue event can be created within the dialogue system of Unity using a special type of script called SequencerCommand.\nThe student player’s dialogues with the game characters can be configured in the dialogue system. Figure 5.9 shows the dialogue entry of a sentence in the dialogue between the student and the water molecule in Unity. This sentence, “B. I’m afraid I cannot teach you”, is spoken by the student to the water molecule to refuse the teaching request from it.\nThe blue rectangle in Figure 5.10 highlights the SequencerCommand GenerateEvent which will be called when this sentence is spoken. Figure 5.10 shows the code snip of the SequencerCommand GenerateEvent. This SequencerCommand extracts the parameters passed to it and calls the function for creating a new event with the parameters.\nThus, using the mechanism explained above, a new event can be created and added to the event log when the student refuses to teach the water molecule. Other dialogue events are generated in a similar way.\nTime Events. In VS Saga, only one time event is tracked. The Event Control component keeps a timer for the student’s inactive time. Inactive time is defined as the time when the student is not actively interacting with the game characters. Whenever a dialogue event is generated, the timer will be reset. When the timer times out, a time-out event will be generated which signals that the student has been inactive.\nTeaching Feedback Events. A teaching feedback event is an event generated to provide feedback to the student’s teaching. Two such events are tracked in VS Saga, namely Teach Success Event and Teach Failure Event.\nThe list of events that are tracked in VS Saga are summarized in Appendix 3."

The FCM Calculation component is implemented according to the FCM model proposed in section 3.3.2. The complete PTA FCM used in VS Saga can be found in Appendix 4.\nA class diagram of the FCM Calculation component is shown in Figure 5.11. From the bottom of the diagram, the AdjacencyList class stores the adjacency list representation of the PTA FCM. The PTA FCM can be represented by a sparse matrix. Compared to a 2D matrix, adjacency list is a more suitable data structure to model sparse matrix as it has higher space efficiency.\nThe class FCMStructure has an instance of AdjacencyList class and contains the logic for the computational processes of FCM. It provides a method called matrixCalculation() which can take in the values of the all causal concepts, perform one round of calculation and return the updated values of the causal concepts.\nMainFCM and SubFCM are two subclasses of FCMStructure and inherit all its attributes and methods. The concept of mainFCM and subFCM are defined in Definition 7 and Definition 8. The SubFCM class overrides the matrixCalculation() method in FCMStructrue as it uses a slightly different way to perform its computational processes.\nThe PTA_FCM class models the structure and characteristics of a PTA FCM. It has an instance of MainFCM class and multiple instances of SubFCM class. The PTA_FCM class also has a list of Concepts which is used to store the values of the causal concepts. The PTA_FCM class coordinates the calculation processes in the mainFCM and multiple subFCMs. Multiple rounds of calculations maybe needed before the values of causal concepts finally stabilize.\nThis implementation of the FCM Calculation component caters to the structure of PTA FCM by modelling mainFCM and subFCMs separately and differentiates their computational processes. In some cases, separating the computations in mainFCM and subFCMs can also increase the overall computational efficiency. For example, for a PTA FCM which uses a trivalent threshold function as shown in Figure 5.12, starting from the second round of calculation, computations only need to be carried out in the mainFCM. By reducing the amount of computations performed, the efficiency of the overall processes is improved."

After a persuasion cue is selected, the PTA Control component calls the UI Control to fetch the information of the selected cue and display it. The information to be fetched from the database includes the texts to be displayed and the facial expression of the water molecule.\nTeachability Reasoning. The concept map (Figure 5.14) is the main interface where the teaching process is performed. In order to teach the PTA (the water molecule), the student completes the concept map by dragging and dropping the buttons on the right side to the blank spaces on the left. When the “Teach” button is clicked, the UI Control saves the contents of the blank spaces as the knowledge learnt and creates a new event to indicate the completion of the teaching process.\nPracticability Reasoning. The banana tree is the most important interface element for the Practicability Reasoning. If the student teaches the PTA correctly, the UI Control will change the color and positions of the tree leaves to make the\ntree become revitalized.

Thus, there are no access issues. However, the Goal Net database and FCM database are two separate databases and both managed by MySQL. Since the best practice is to keep only one open connection at any time, accesses to these two databases need to be coordinated. The Database Access loads the FCM model from the FCM database during initialization and closes the connection to the FCM database. Then, it opens the connection to the Goal Net database and executes queries while the Goal Net Interpreter is traversing the Goal Net of the PTA.\nChapter 6 Case Studies and Assessment of PTA"

The learning and teaching processes are designed as a more\nenjoyable experience than the traditional class room style. The processes would be engaging.\nAreas for Improvement\n The game and the PTA should be able to cater to different learning\ncontents, not only for diffusion and osmosis.\n When evaluating the ability level of the student, his or her ability to\nlearn and prior knowledge should also be taken into consideration. If the student is slow learner and has little prior knowledge in related topics, he or she should be allowed more time to learn instead of being persuaded immediately.\nA g\ne n\nt D\ne si\ng n\ne rs\nAdvantages\n The goal-oriented approach enables the agent to direct its own\nbehavior and perform tasks in the pursuit of its own goal.\n The propose Goal Net Model describes a PTA in all its aspect and\naccommodates flexibility.\n The integration of FCM enhances the qualitative reasoning ability of\nthe agent.\nAreas for Improvement\n The agent is implemented specifically for topics in the science\ndomain. However, the design of the agent should incorporate the flexibility so it can be deployed for more topics and in more domains.\nG a m\ne D\ne v e lo\np e rs\nAdvantages\n The system architecture is easy to understand. It’s abstract enough to\nbe reusable.\n I would implement it in similar ways.\nAreas for Improvement\n Currently, the task functions are implemented in Unity. They can\nalso be implemented as DLL files, which can be more easily called by a virtual machine (the interpreter).  Most teachers are computer novices who are not familiar with game\ndevelopment and agent design. Convenient update tools should be developed for them, if the teachers need to update the learning content frequently.\nGenerally, the results of the assessment are quite positive. The results show that the PTA has the ability to motivate and engage the student by generating personalized feedback and the potential to help the student build positive attitude towards learning. It also turns the learning process into an enjoyable journey which could potentially help the student build positive attitudes towards learning. In terms of modelling, the Goal Net model depicts a PTA in all its aspects. The system architecture has also been endorsed for its reasonableness and reusability.\nAnother important advantage of the PTA has been put forward during the focus group discussion. Compared to the human teacher, the PTA can generate more timely feedback, as it is able to closely “supervise” the student by monitoring his or her motivation and ability level using a more direct and quantitative approach."

By incorporating the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of persuasion, the PTA is able to provide more timely and personalized feedback based on the student’s ability and motivation, which previous TAs are incapable of.\nHowever, the existing PTA model still has a few limitations. Firstly, the existing agent model has only proposed the Goal Net model for the Persuasion Reasoning while does not have Goal Net models for the Teachability Reasoning and the Practicability Reasoning. Secondly, the FCM model for the Persuasion Reasoning is difficult to reuse as it is highly context dependent. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of the PTA.\nIn this project, a complete and integrate PTA agent model was proposed. Directed by a goal-oriented approach, the agent model depicts a PTA in its totality, including its ability to perform Persuasion Reasoning, Teachability Reasoning and Practicability Reasoning. This project also proposed a FCM model with greater reusability for computational processes in the Persuasion Reasoning of the PTA. In some cases, the proposed FCM model is able to show improved overall computational efficiency. Besides proposing improvements for the theoretical models of the PTA, system architecture for the control structure of the agent was introduced as well, with detailed descriptions for each component in the architecture and how it can be implemented.\nFollowing the proposed agent model and system architecture, an instance of the PTA has been successfully deployed in the 3D videogame, VS Saga. This implementation demonstrated the practice of instantiating a PTA from the propose agent model and system architecture. It also enabled the assessment and evaluation of the PTA. A focus group study was performed to assess the PTA.\nThe results of the study demonstrated the effectiveness of the PTA. The results were quite positive, showing the PTA is able to motivate and engage the student by generating timely and personalized feedback. It was also believed that the PTA has the potential to help the student build positive attitude towards learning. Moreover, positive feedback has been received for the completeness of the new agent model and the reusability of the proposed system architecture."

Thus, there is a need to propose a convenient way to modify the models of the agent and change the content of the knowledge base. One way\nto incorporate that kind of flexibility is to design an authoring tool for the PTA. Referring to the design of the authoring tool which Ailiya proposed for the Affective Teachable Agent [11], a similar design can be proposed for the authoring tool of the PTA (Figure 7.1). A dedicated Game Authoring Component can be created, which provides interfaces for creating and editing learning goals, content knowledge and game tasks. If any changes are made from the Game Authoring Component, the models and knowledge stored in the knowledge base should be updated accordingly.\nAuthoring processes would involve both the teacher and the game developer. The teacher defines the learning goals and relevant content knowledge. The teacher then designs different game tasks according to the learning goals.

However, in VS Saga, the assessment of motivation and ability level is mostly based on instant event data and only 3 out of these 7 types of events are tracked.\nIn future studies, efforts can be directed to increase the type of events tracked. By analyzing more sources of events, the PTA will be able to assess the motivation and ability level of the student more accurately. Moreover, future researches could look into the application of educational data mining to analyze the relationship between different types of student behavioral data and the level of motivation and ability.\nFor example, as suggested in Table 4.3, Location Events can be tracked in the PTA environment. By collecting the location of students in the virtual environment every few seconds, abundant location data can be obtained. Data mining techniques can be applied to these location data to mine the location patterns of the student. Relationships can be established between these patterns and the motivation and ability level of the student. For example, if the points indicating locations are clustered around the main characters in the scenes and the banana tree with only a few outliers, the student has probably been focusing on his or her mission on the island and is potentially in a high motivation state."

Nowadays, the traditional academic assessment approaches cannot thoroughly reflect the students’ learning competencies which are crucial for them to thrive in a fast-changing world. We propose an assessment system that seamlessly integrates EDM with functionality and affordance of a virtual environment to assess students’ learning competency through analysing their behavioural data and patterns. We also propose a set of metrics which can be used for judging students’ learning competency and how these metrics can be evaluated computationally by quantifying and capturing students’ behavioural data in a virtual environment. The field study, which is conducted in Xinmin Secondary School in Singapore, showed that the proposed assessment system is promising in identifying useful behaviour metrics for assessing learning competency. The system also exhibits more potential in terms of its quantitative and objective approach, comparing to traditional assessment methods."
