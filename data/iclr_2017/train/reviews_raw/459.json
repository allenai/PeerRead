{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Deep Multi-task Representation Learning: A Tensor Factorisation Approach", "abstract": "Most contemporary multi-task learning methods assume linear models. This setting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, we present a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach is based on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly or implicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, to realise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks. This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need a user-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to both homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our deep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy and fewer design choices.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The paper proposed a nice framework leveraging Tucker and Tensor train low-rank tensor factorization to induce parameter sharing for multi-task learning.\n\nThe framework is nice and appealing. \n\nHowever, MTL is a very well studied problem and the paper considers simple task for different classification, and it is not clear if we really need ``Deep Learning\" for these simple datasets. A comparison with existing shallow MTL is necessary to show the benefits of the proposed methods (and in particular being deep) on the dataset. The authors ignore them on the basis of speculation and it is not clear if the proposed framework is really superior to simple regularizations like the nuclear norm.

A fourth reviewer with strong expertise in multi-task learning and deep learning was brought in to read the latest manuscript. Due to time constraints, this fourth review was not entered in the system but communicated through personal communication. \n \n Pros:\n - Reviewers in general found the paper clear and well written.\n - Multi-task learning in deep models is of interest to the community\n - The approach is sensible and the experiments show that it seems to work\n \n Cons:\n - Factorization methods have been used extensively in deep learning, so the reviewers may have found the approach incremental\n - One reviewer was not convinced that the proposed method would work better than existing multi-task learning methods\n - Not all reviewers were convinced by the experiments\n - The fourth reviewer found the approach very sensible but was not excited enough to champion the paper\n \n The paper was highly regarded by at least one reviewer and two thought it should be accepted.

Based on their comments, we have revised the submission.\n\nThe main changed parts are:\n\n1. We discuss some related work in multi-task learning from speech recognition community. (Sec 2, Comment from Reviewer 3).\n\n2. We add a new section in related work to discuss the literature in the line of constructing a MTL-like problem via clustering training data. (Sec 2, Pre-review question from Reviewer2)\n\n3. We give more details about initialisation, particularly how to make the random initialisation condition work in practice. (Sec 4, Comment from Reviewer 2)\n\nFinally, we add two more experiments. Due to page limits, they are placed in the appendix.\n\nA) We compare our methods with some classic (shallow, matrix-based) MTL methods using both classic and CNN features. (Appendix A, Comment from Reviewer 1)\n\nB) We add details about model size in terms of number of parameters, and demonstrate what happens if we make an almost equal sized UD-MTL competitor.
