INTRODUCTION\nThe nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier is one of the most used and well-known approaches for performing recognition tasks since it was first introduced in 1951 by (Fix & Hodges, 1951) and later developed by (Cover & Hart, 1967). This approach is one of the simplest and oldest methods used in data mining (DM) and pattern classification. Moreover, it is considered one of the top 10 methods in DM (Wu, 2010). It often yields efficient performance and, in certain cases, its accuracy is greater than state-of the-art classifiers (Hamamoto et al., 1997)(Alpaydin, 1997).The KNN classifier categorizes an unlabelled test example using the label of the majority of examples among its k-nearest (most similar) neighbours in the training set. The similarity depends on a specific distance metric, therefore, the performance of the classifier depends significantly on the distance metric used (Weinberger & Saul, 2009).\nA large number of similarity measures are proposed in the literature, perhaps the most famous and well known being the Euclidean distance (ED) stated by Euclid two thousand years ago. The ED has been receiving increased attention, because many applications, such as bioinformatics, dimensionality reduction in machine learning, statistics, and many others have all become very active research areas, which are mainly dependent on ED (Nathan Krislock, 2012).\nIn addition, over the last century, great efforts have been made to find new metrics and similarity measures to satisfy the needs of different applications. New similarity measures are needed, in particular, for use in distance learning (Yang, 2006), where classifiers such as the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) are heavily dependent upon choosing the best distance. Optimizing the distance metric is valuable in several computer vision tasks, such as object detection, content-based image retrieval, image segmentation and classification.\nThe similarity measures that are used the most are Euclidean (ED) and Manhattan distances (MD); both assume the same weight to all directions. In addition, the difference between vectors at each dimension might approach infinity to imply dissimilarity (Bharkad & Kokare, 2011). Therefore, such types of distances are heavily affected by the different scale of the data, noise and outliers. To solve those problems, Hassanat proposed an interesting distance metric (Hassanat, 2014), which is invariant to the different scales in multi dimensions data.\nThe main purpose of this work is to equip some of the nearest neighbour classifiers with Hassanat distance, attempting to enhance their performance. The rest of this paper describes some of the nearest neighbour classifiers to be enhanced, in addition to describing the Hassanat metric. The third section describes the data set used for experiments and discusses the results, focusing on applying the new metric which is used by some nearest neighbour classifiers."

      "text" : "KNN is a very simple yet effective classifier that is used for pattern classification. It categorizes an unlabelled test example using the label of the majority of examples among its k-nearest (most similar) neighbours in the training set (see Figure 1). The similarity depends on a specific distance metric, normally ED or MD, therefore, the performance of the classifier depends significantly on the distance metric used. Because of its simplicity and popularity it has been used extensively in pattern recognition, machine learning, text categorization, data mining, object recognition, etc. (Kataria & Singh, 2013)(Bhatia & Vandana, 2010) and (Hassanat, 2009). However, it has some limitations, such as\nCanadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences (CJPAS). volume 9, issue 1, Feb 2015. memory requirement and time complexity, because it is fully dependent on every example in the training set and choosing the optimal k neighbours in advance.\nInverted Indexes of Neighbours Classifier (IINC).\nThe inverted indexes of neighbours classifier IINC (Jirina & Jirina, 2008), (Jirina & Jirina, 2010)and (Jirina & Jirina, 2011) is one of the best attempts found in the literature to solve the optimal k problems related to the KNN classifier. The aim of their work was to increase the accuracy of the classifier by using all the neighbours in the training set, so k has become the whole number of examples in the training set, rewarding the nearest neighbours by adding some heavyweight, and penalizing the furthest one by giving them lightweight. Moreover, the first nearest neighbour of the point, for example x, has the biggest influence on what class point x goes to. The IINC approach is mainly based on the hypothesis that the influence, the weight of a neighbour, is proportional to the distance from the query point.\nThe IINC algorithm works as follows: the distances between the test point and the other points in the training set are calculated, and then sorted in ascending order. The summation of the inverted indexes is then calculated for each class using Eq (1). The probability of each class is then calculated using Eq (2). Obviously, the class with the highest probability is then predicted.\nS = ∑ ( )\n(1)\nWhere Lc is the number of points of class c, i is the order of the point in the training set after sorting the distances.\nThe probability of a test point x belonging to a class c is estimated by:\nP(x|c) = (2)\nwhere S = ∑ and N is the number of examples in the training set.\nTo visualize the IINC, cover all the points in Figure 1 by a large circle that fits all the points."

      "heading" : "ENN",
      "text" : "The ENN classifier (Hassanat, 2014) uses an ensemble learning approach based on the same nearest neighbour rule. Fundamentally, the traditional KNN classifier is used each time with a different K. Starting from k=1 to k= the square root of the number of examples in the training set, each classifier votes for a specific class. Then it uses the weighted sum rule to identify the class, i.e. the class with the highest sum (by 1-NN, 3-NN, 5-NN… √n-NN) is chosen.\nENN uses √n down to k=1 with only odd numbers to increase the speed of the algorithm by avoiding the even classifiers and to avoid the chance of two different classes having the same number of votes. The used weight is expressed by:\n( ) = ( ) (3)\nWhen a test point is compared with all examples, using some distance function, an array (A) is created to hold the nearest √n classes, and the weighted sum (WS) rule is defined for each class using:\n= ∑ ∑ ( ), !\" = #0, %&ℎ() *(+ ,\" √., , = + 2 (4)\nwhere, for each class, the outer sum represents the KNN classifier for each odd k, and the inner sum calculates the weights for each classifier.\nThe predicted class is the one with the maximum weighted sum:\n#12** = argmax 789\n(5)\nTo visualize the ENN classifier, assume that there are 25 points in a 2D feature space belonging to 2 different classes (0 and 1), and one unknown point (the green triangle) as shown in Figure 1. The ensemble system uses the 1-NN, 3- NN and 5-NN classifiers altogether using the WS rule to find the class of the “green triangle”, which in this example and according to the ENN is predicted to be class 1 “red square”.\nCanadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences (CJPAS). volume 9, issue 1, Feb 2015."

Except for some datasets such as the “EEG”, whose accuracy increased significantly from 84% to 97%, this result proves that data might be harmed by normalization, and there is a need for a distance metric that is not affected by the data scale, and therefore does not need data normalization. These results confirm some results in (Hassanat, 2014), such as the superiority of the IINC and the ENN classifiers, in terms of being independent from choosing the optimal k neighbours. On the other hand, after employing Hassanat distance with the nearest neighbour classifiers on the same data sets and without normalization, we obtained the results depicted in Table 3.\nVote 0.92 0.92 0.92 0.92 0.92 0.91 0.92 0.93 Vowel 0.97 0.92 0.85 0.76 0.69 0.54 0.94 0.94 Waveform21 0.75 0.79 0.81 0.82 0.82 0.85 0.83 0.84 Waveform40 0.72 0.77 0.79 0.80 0.81 0.84 0.83 0.84 wholesale 0.87 0.88 0.89 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.90 0.89 Wine 0.97 0.97 0.96 0.96 0.96 0.96 0.97 0.97\nAverage 0.84 0.85 0.86 0.85 0.85 0.84 0.87 0.87\nBy comparing columns in Tables 2 and 3, the significant increase in the performance of each algorithm can be observed. Table 4 illustrates the increase in the accuracy of each algorithm after applying Hassanat distance; this enhancement proves that Hassanat distance is not affected by the scale of the data.\nThe average row in Table 4 confirms that using Hassanat distance enhances the performance of the nearest neighbour algorithms by 2.9% to 3.8%.The same table also shows a significant improvement in most algorithms in most data sets, such as the 30% to 35.9% boost in the accuracy of the data set BCW. Although the increase in performance is the theme, sometimes when the performance is decreased, however, these degrades were not beyond 4.1%.\nIt can be noted from Table 3 that both ENN and IINC performed very well with Hassanat distance, as their accuracy increased significantly by 3.3% and 3.1% respectively, with no significant advantage of the ENN over the IINC in terms of accuracy, and this result is confirmed by (Hassanat, 2014). Also, it can be noted from Tables 2,3 and 4 that there is no optimal algorithm that can solve all real life problems perfectly; this conclusion is supported by\nCanadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences (CJPAS). volume 9, issue 1, Feb 2015. the no-free-lunch theorem (Duda et al., 2001). However, some algorithms, such as ENN and IINC using Hassanat distance, give more stable results than the others, i.e. if they are not the best to classify a specific (problem) data set, they are not the worst, and their results are very close to the best-gained results. This type of stability is illustrated by Table 5, where we record the absolute difference between each result and the best result within a specific data set.\nAs can be noticed in Table 5, ENN and IINC are the most stable classifiers, while the rest of the algorithms are much less stable, even if they beat (sometimes) ENN and IINC."

The results demonstrate the superiority of this distance metric over the traditional and most-used distances, such as Manhattan distance and Euclidian distance. Moreover, we proved that the Hassanat distance metric is invariant to data scale, noise and outliers. Throughout this work, it is clearly notable that both ENN and IINC performed very well with the distance investigated, as their accuracy increased significantly by 3.3% and 3.1% respectively, with no significant advantage of the ENN over the IINC in terms of accuracy. Correspondingly, it can be noted from our results that there is no optimal algorithm that can solve all reallife problems perfectly; this is supported by the no-free-lunch theorem.",
