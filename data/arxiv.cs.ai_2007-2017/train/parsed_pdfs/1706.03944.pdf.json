      "text" : "In the telecommunication industry, the lion’s share of capital is spent on the infrastructure and its maintenance. The revenues are dependent on the size and the quality of the customer base: without a customer there is no business, yet satisfying everyone is simply not feasible, unless the right ones are chosen and others are let to go [1]. The population in Sweden is growing rapidly due to immigration. In this light, the issue of infrastructure upgrades to provide telecommunication services is of importance. New antennas can be installed at hot spots of user demand, which will require an investment, and/or the clientele expansion can be carried out in a planned manner to promote the exploitation of the infrastructure in the less loaded geographical zones. In this paper, we explore the second alternative and formulate the recommendations with respect to an intelligent expansion of the customerbase. Specifically, the problem we concern ourselves with is how to find a balanced user portfolio in order to optimally exploit the infrastructure and get maximum benefit\nfrom the investments. The intuitive observation, which motivated our solution, is as follows. The individual mobility patterns of different user segments sum up into a collective footprint, which the whole customer base produces on the infrastructure in a time-continuous manner. The desired property of such a collective footprint is that it does not exhibit skinny peaks and gaps in time. The closer to the optimal “heavy and yet even load” scenario, the better the infrastructure is exploited.\nMethodology-wise, the literature in telecommunications research is abundant with optimization approaches formulated for the exploitation of telecommunication networks under the disguise of the problems (at first glance possibly unrelated to ours) such as optimal location of cell towers, optimization of base stations deployment and so on, e.g. [2]-[5]. For example, the dual formulation of the optimal positioning of new cell towers turns out to be our problem of finding an optimal portfolio with user segments [6]. Thus, the literature suggests a methodological appropriateness of a linear programming formulation. The research gap we have noticed and fill in is that, to our best knowledge, such works do not make use of historical data.\nAnother question is how to represent different user groups within the linear programming system. To this end, postcode-based geo-demographic segments are both strong predictors of user behavior and operational user handles in marketing campaigns. Compared with conventional occupational measures of social class, postcode classifications typically achieve higher levels of discrimination, whether averaged across a random basket of behaviors recorded on the Target Group Index or surveys of citizen satisfaction with the provision of local authority services. One of the reasons that segmentation systems like MOSAIC are so effective is that they are created by combining statistical averages for both census data and consumer spending data in pre-defined geographical units [7]. The postcode descriptors allow us powerful means to unravel lifestyle differences in ways that are difficult to distinguish using conventional survey research given limited sources and sample size constraints [8]. For example, it was demonstrated that middle-class MOSAIC categories in the UK such as ‘New Urban Colonists’, ‘Bungalow Retirement’, ‘Gentrified Villages’ and ‘Conservative Values’, whilst very similar in terms of overall social status, nonetheless register widely different public attitudes and voting intentions, show support for different kinds of charities and preferences for different media as well as different forms of consumption. Geodemographic categories correlate to diabetes propensity [9], school students’ performance [8], broadband access and availability [7], and so on. Industries rely increasingly on geodemographic segmentation to classify their markets when acquiring new customers [10]. The localized versions of MOSAIC have been developed for a number of countries, including the USA and the EU countries. The main geodemographic systems are in competition with each other and the exact details of the data and methods for generating lifestyles segments are never released [11] and, as a result, the specific variables or the derivations of these variables are unknown. Faced with this uncertainty, we have tried two different geodemographic segmenations and diverse levels of granularity in those. The contributions of this paper are as follows. A data-driven methodological framework has been formulated as a classical resource allocation problem to calculate the degree of desirability of different groups of clients based on the footprint they and the rest of the population produce on the infrastructure. We have verified our idea in a case study: the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base was identified. As a natural consequence of the approach, a functionality has been developed to assess the potential of a planned marketing campaign. Then, the problem of finding the optimal number of geo-demographic segments to target simultaneously has been addressed empirically. We compare different marketing scenarios for the two segmentations available: the MOSAIC with two levels of granularity (15\nsegments and 46 subsegments) and six segments developed by InsightOne specifically for Telenor. We investigate the trade off: more effort is required to target a greater number of segments, but a finer discrimination would lead to a better control of infrastructure exploitation and, thus, higher revenues. Fuzzy logic modeling is used to build an interface between a manager and big data processing to translate the conclusions into a comprehensible summary in a natural language. While translating numeric answers into recommendations, insignificant numeric deviations are gotten rid of due to a formulation with qualitatively different hedges: extremely, very, rather, and hardly. The following queries have been formulated on the mobility database: • Which segments are extremely/very/rather desired? • How the infrastructure is currently exploited: extremely/very/rather or hardly\nefficiently? • If the identified segments are boosted as expected as a result of a\ncorresponding marketing camapign, how will the exploitation efficiency change?\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the data set is described. Section 3 explains the classical resource allocation formulation for our problem with a data-driven aspect. Section 4 addresses the problem of building an interface between a manager and big data processing. In Section 5, experiments are covered, and the trade-off between the granularity of segmentation and the impact of the resulting footprint on the infrastructure is investigated. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 6."

      "text" : "The study has been conducted on anonymized geospatial and geo-demographic data provided by a Scandinavian telecommunication operator. The data consist of CDRs (Call Detail Records) containing historical location data and calls made during one week in a midsized region in Sweden with more than one thousand radio cells. Several cells can be located on the same antenna. The cell density varies in different areas and is higher in city centers, compared to rural areas. The locations of 27010 clients are registered together with which cell serves the client. The location is registered every five minutes. In the periods when the client does not generate any traffic, she does not make any impact on the infrastructure and such periods of inactivity are not included in the resource allocation analysis. Every client in the database is labeled with her geo-demographic segment. The fields of the database used in this study are: • the cells IDs with the information about which a user it served at different time\npoints, • the location coordinates of the cells, • the time stamps of every event with a 5 minute resolution, • the MOSAIC geo-demographic segment (and subsegment) for each client, and • the Telenor geo-demographic segment for each client.\nThere are 15 (and 46) MOSAIC segments (and subsegments) present in the geographic region under analysis; for their detailed description the reader is referred to [12]. The six in-house segments were developed by Telenor in collaboration with\nInsightOne, and, to our best knowledge, though not conceptually different from MOSAIC, they are especially crafted for marketing in telecommunication businesses."

      "text" : "The individual mobility patterns of different user segments sum up into their collective footprint, which the whole customer base produces on the infrastructure in a time-continuous manner. A desired property of such a collective footprint is that it does not exhibit skinny peaks and gaps in time. The closer to the optimal “even load” scenario, the better the infrastructure is exploited. The model’s variables are the following.\nVariables:\n• clientSet: set of with IDs of clients; • I: the set with geo-demographic segments {segment1, …, segmentk}; • D: the mobility data for a region that for each user contain client’s ID, client’s geo-demographic segment, time stamps when the client generated traffic, and which antenna served the client. • Si: the number of subscribers that belong to a geo-demographic segment i; • Si*: the optimal number of subscribers that belong to a geodemographic segment i; • Si,t,j : the footprint by segment i, i.e. the number of subscribers that belong to a geo-demographic segment i, at time moment t, who are registered with a particular cell j; • Cj: the capacity of cell j in terms of how many persons it can safely handle simultaneously; • x: the vector with the scaling coefficients for the geodemographic segments or other groups such as IS clients; • xIS: the coefficent for the IS segment from the vector x; • Nt,j: number of users at cell j at time t.\nThe problem of finding an optimal combination of user segments, given that we want to maximize the overall number of users, who consume finite resources, belongs to a family of resource allocation problems. The formulation of our problem is as follows:\n• The vector x with the decision variables x={ xCC, xCA, xMJM, xQA, xT, xVA}. The decision variables represent the scaling coefficients for each geodemographic segment. In case of Telenor segmentation they are: cost-aware (CA), modern John/Mary (MJM), quality aware (QA), traditional (T), value aware (VA), and corporate clients (CC). A scaling coefficient xi is greater than 1, if the number of clients of a given geo-demographic segment is desired to be increased. For example, for the category in the customer base that is to be doubled xi = 2. Similarly, if xi < 1 for a geo-demographic segment, it means that the number of clients is to be reduced. The xi = 0 value indicates that the segment is absolutely unwanted in the clientele. By formulation x is non-negative. • The objective function seeks to maximize the number of subscribers:\nMaximize Σi∈{ CC, CA, MJM, QA, T, VA} Si xi (1)\n• The restrictions\nfor all j,t, Σ i∈{ CC, CA, MJM, QA, T, VA} Si,t,j xi ≤ Cj (2)\nrepresent the observed number of persons in each user group at a particular time and served by a particular cell multiplied by the scaling coefficient. This value is required not to exceed the capacity of the cell Cj in terms of how many persons it can handle at a time. In other words the restriction says: if the historical number of users are scaled with a coefficient for their geodemographic category, the cells should not be overloaded.\nA consensus reached in the literature [13]-[15] is that the mobility pattern for the subscribers is predictable due to strong spatio-temporal regularity. The corollary is that the increase in the number of subscribers in a given segment with a factor x will result in an increase of the load generated by the segment with a factor x for each time and cell.\nThe LP model is solved for the input data D and the set of segments I:\n(xI, max_objI,D) = combinatorial_optimization(D,I). (3)\nThe output is the vector with the optimal scaling coefficients xI and the maximum value of the objective function.\nConsider a small example with two cells, two subscriber segments and three time slots. The footprint values are shown in Table I. The total number of subscribers in segment 1 is 60, and the total number of subscribers in segment 2 is 40 (s = (60, 40)T). The capacity of both radio cells is 200, i.e., c = (200, 200)T. The optimization problem becomes:\nMaximize 60x1 + 40x2. The LP problem has 6 restrictions:\nfor t1, cell 1: 40x1 ≤ 200, for t1, cell 2: 20x1 + 20x2 ≤ 200,\nfor t2, cell 1: 40x1 ≤ 200,\nfor t2, cell 2: 40x2 ≤ 200, for t3, cell 1: 25x1 + 25x2 ≤ 200,\nfor t3, cell 2: 10x1 + 20x2 ≤ 200,\nx≥0. That is, we have the following:\nSolving this LP problem yields the optimal x = (5, 3)T, corresponding to of\n420. Cell 1 Cell 2 Time slot Segment 1 Segment 2 Segment 1 Segment 2\nBefore we continue, we need to discuss some implicitly made assumptions that may be not necessarily fair. Firstly, all the clients generate the same revenue. Concrete tariffs are integrated in the form of coefficients of the objective function. Let the tariff for the user category i be denoted with Ri. Then, the initial objective function from Equation 1 is extended into\nMaximize Σi∈{ CC,CA, MJM, QA, T, VA} Ri Si xi. Secondly, the impact on the network produced by different users is the same. The calculation of the impact on the network can be refined taking into account the historical traffic. Let the traffic generated by the user group be Ti. The restrictions from Equation 2 are modified:\nΣi∈{CC, CA, MJM, QA, T, VA} Ti,t,j xi ≤ Cj. these clarifications can be easily accommodated in the system, but currently the relevant knowledge about Ri and Ti is out of our reach."

      "text" : "Definition (in the style of [17]). A fuzzy set A in X is characterized by a membership function fA(x), which associates with each point in X a real number in the interval [0, 1], with the value of fA(x) at x representing the \"grade of membership\" of x in A. For the opposite quality: fnotA(x) = 1- fA(x).\nFuzzy membership scores reflect the varying degree to which different cases belong to a set: • Under the six value fuzzy set, there are six tiers of membership 1: fully in, 0.9:\nmostly but not fully in, 0.6: more or less in, 0.4: more or less out, 0.1: mostly but not fully out, 0: fully out.\n• Thus, fuzzy sets combine qualitative and quantitative assessment: 1 and 0 are qualitative assignments (“fully in” and “fully out”, respectively); values between 0 and 1 indicate partial membership. The 0.5 score is also qualitatively anchored, for it indicates the point of maximum ambiguity (fuzziness) in the assessment of whether a case is more “in” or “out” of a set.\nFor a comprehensive guide of good practices in fuzzy logic analysis in social sciences the reader is referred to, for example, [18].\nLinguistic hedges: • Rather will be added to a quality A, if the square root of its membership\nfunction fA(x)1/2 is close to 1.\n• Very will be added to a quality A, if the square of its membership function fA(x)2 is close to 1. • Extremely will be added to a quality A, if fA(x)3 is close to 1. The interpretation follows from the application of the hedge operator, which adds the quantifiers such as very, rather, extremely, to the membership function, for example fveryA(x)= fA(x)2 [19]. Then, given the new membership function, the same principle applies: the closer to 1, the higher is the degree of membership. Inside a tier, the hedged membership functions obey an inclusion relation: extremely f ⊂ very f ⊂ rather f. As long as the same hedge applies to the value of the membership function, numeric differences are held as insignificant (they are quantitative), once the condition for a new hedge is met, the situation changes in a qualitative way, e.g. comparing two attempts the Collective Ear can confirm that both of those are very representative of anger, and thus the numeric differences between their assessments do not matter."

      "text" : "Desirability of user groups: in order to make the vector x express the desirability of different user groups, the scaling coefficients are normalized so that the largest normalized coefficient is equal to 1. Then, xi is naturally interpreted to be the fdesired(segment i), and the tests for different hedges are applicable (See Section 5.1).\nAssessing the success of a marketing campaign and the consequences of the modifications in the customer base can be simulated. The red line (see Figure 1) is the limit of success in the infrastructure exploitation and represents the most successful marketing campaign possible, i.e. with the membership value for efficiency equal to 1. The blue line has been calculated for the present x is the starting point for a new marketing campaign and serves as a separation point between business expansion and losses, i.e. with the membership function equal to 0.5. All the reasonable scenarios fall between the present and the best possible value.\nand the optimized proportion (red) of segments in the customer base.\nExperiments\n6.1 Optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments Once the LP model was built from the data and solved with the gurobi solver [20] using HPI Future SoC Lab Hardware Resources, the vector with the optimal scaling coefficients was returned:\nx = (0, 0.13, 0, 1.45, 4.85, 0.92)T. With the optimal proportion of the geo-demographic segments in the customer base,\n57% more clients can be safely served without inducing any upgrade costs or overloading the cells. The ideal coefficients are unlikely to be attained ever, but even moving towards the optimal proportion of the geo-demographic segments means moving towards higher revenues and more efficient antenna exploitation. In Figure 1, where the objective function (i.e. how many users can be provided service in a safe manner) is plotted against the cell capacity, the cell capacity has been taken to be an interval from 0 to 200 clients rather than an integer value, because the actual footprint depends on how the users are consuming services, as for example, streaming video (and creating a heavy footprint) versus just receiving an SMS (a light footprint).\nComparing the obtained values for {xCC, xCA, xMJM, xQA, xT, xVA} to the coefficients in the current proportion, a conclusion is made whether the geodemographic segment needs to be reduced or boosted. The recommended action is to boost the Quality-Aware and Traditional segments, get rid of Corporate Clients and Modern John Mary and partially reduce all the other segments. Vector x in the normalized form is:\nxnormalized = (0, 0.02, 0, 0.29, 1, 0.18). Query 1: Retrieve very desired segments.\nfor segment in I do{ v_desired(segment)=FALSE IF (fdesired(segment)2 ≥ 0.9) THEN v_desired(segment)=TRUE }\nIn our case study, only the Traditional segment is very desired. Analogous tests on the value of the membership function are executed to check the applicability of other hedges.\nIf the old clientele is decided to be kept, additional restrictions are to be added to the LP: xi ≥ 1. Obviously, pleasing everyone has a negative effect on the slope of benefit generation. Figure 2 reflects the cost in terms of the objective value. As follows from the graphics, the minimum cell capacity of 165 is required to be able to reliably provide service to everyone and there is no additional revenue. From the capacity of 165 to 310 the benefit generation is slowed down by having to keep the old clients. Once the cell would serve more than 310 persons at a time, the restrictions xi ≥ 1 stop being tight, and keeping the old clients would not imply any potential losses, but currently the cell capacity is limited to 200 clients.\nQuery 2: How the infrastructure is currently exploited: extremely, very, rather or hardly efficiently? fefficently exploited=current_obj (max_obj)-1 , where current_obj is the maximum number of persons that the infrastructure can serve, given that the present proportion of the segments is kept (a linear, indiscriminative expansion of the customer base), and max_obj is the theoretically largest possible number of clients that can be served given the ideal proportions of the segments. Further the tests for the applicability of the linguistic hedges can be tried, as was explained in Section 4.1.\nOnce the optimal proportion of segments in the clientele (S) is known, it is direct to\nassess the optimality of the present customer base and changes in it: foptimal(S) = Σall i Si (Σall i S*i)-1 and foptimal(Snew) = Σall i Sinew (Σall i S*i)-1. Suppose a marketing campaign A is expected to transform the current clientele Si into Sinew : Action A: Si →Sinew. Firstly, the LP is checked for feasibility, given Snew, i.e. the modifications must not violate any of the restrictions. The measure for efficiency for the potential of A is defined as:\nfefficent(A)=(fefficient(Snew) - fefficient(S))(1 - fefficient(S))-1. Query 3: If in cause in a particular marketing campaign A the identified segments are boosted as expected, how will the exploitation efficiency change? For example, within A the segments Traditional and Quality-Aware are planned to\nbe boosted by 5-7%. An alternative B implies boosting Quality-Aware and Traditional by 8-10% and 1-3%, respectively. According to their simulation details in\nTable 2. action A is 0.035 better than action B, but they fall into the same tier with\nrespect to their potential. It does not make a qualitative difference which action to undertake.\nCorporate clients 139 subscribers in the database Cost aware 4003 subscribers in the database Modern John/Mary 5963 subscribers in the database Quality aware 5805 subscribers in the database Traditional 6007 subscribers in the database Value aware 5093 subscribers in the database New clients with A [590, 826] Expansion as a result of A feasible yes New clients with B [524, 2382] Expansion as a result of B feasible yes fefficient with A(Snew) [0.63, 0.65] fefficient with B(Snew) [0.64, 0.68] fefficient(S) 0.63 fefficent(A) [0; 0.65] fefficent(B) [0.01; 0.13] E(fefficent(A)) 0.06 E(fefficent(B)) 0.025 Same tier? Yes Conclusions No difference Table 1: Comparison of the expected effects of action A and B targeting on Telenor segmentation.\n5.2 Granularity vs. Efficiency\nThe more decision variables, the more degrees of freedom the LP model has, and naturally the higher value of the objective function can be achieved. A comparison of the performance for different segmentations is presented in Figure 3: 46 MOSAIC sub-segments, 15 MOSAIC segments, and 6 Telenor segments. To study the effect of granularity, we employed a greedy merge heuristic algorithm relying on the following heuristic.\nHeuristic 1: “at one step, merge the two segments, for which the scaling coefficients are closest”. The choice of the heuristic was motivated by the observation, that if the scaling coefficients are close, then the corresponding segments should receive the same encouraging or discouraging force, and, when possible, the marketing campaign can be run once and target both of the segments at once. As was expected, with the 45 MOSAIC sub-segments the best optimization result has been achieved, due to the highest degree of freedom in the LP model. In line with this observation, when the number of segments reaches the number of the MOSAIC sub-segments, they demonstrate a similar success rate. The Telenor segments perform the worst, which is explainable with the fact that MOSAIC is a successful predictor of distinct qualities (footprint as a result of the life-style), while the Telenor segmentation partition was crafted to facilitate handy segment definitions. The results exhibit two trade-offs.\nFirstly, while planning campaigns, on one hand more effort is required to target a greater number of segments, but on the other hand a finer discrimination would lead to a more optimal infrastructure exploitation and higher revenues. Secondly, on one hand, the merged MOSAIC segments would improve the performance compared to the in-house segmentation, but on the other hand the latter is more convenient for the marketing department to work with."

Applying the proposed method to the case study, we have identified the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base, developed a functionality to assess the potential of a planned marketing campaign, and explored the problem of an optimal number and types of the geo-demographic segments to target through marketing campaigns. With the help of fuzzy logic, the conclusions of data analysis are automatically translated into comprehensible recommendations in a natural language.",
