      "text" : "To answer the question in machine comprehension (MC) task, the models need to establish the interaction between the question and the context. To tackle the problem that the single-pass model cannot reflect on and correct its answer, we present Ruminating Reader. Ruminating Reader adds a second pass of attention and a novel information fusion component to the Bi-Directional Attention Flow model (BIDAF). We propose novel layer structures that construct an query-aware context vector representation and fuse encoding representation with intermediate representation on top of BIDAF model. We show that a multi-hop attention mechanism can be applied to a bi-directional attention structure. In experiments on SQuAD, we find that the Reader outperforms the BIDAF baseline by a substantial margin, and matches or surpasses the performance of all other published systems."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The majority of recorded human knowledge is circulated in unstructured natural language. It is tremendously valuable to allow machines to read and comprehend the text knowledge. Machine comprehension (MC)—especially in the form of question answering (QA)—is therefore attracting a significant amount of attention from the machine learning community. Recently introduced large-scale datasets like CNN/Daily Mail (Hermann et al., 2015), the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD; Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and the Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension Dataset (MS-MARCO; Nguyen et al., 2016) have\nallow data-driven methods, including deep learning, to become viable.\nRecent approaches toward solving machine comprehension tasks using neural networks can be viewed as falling into two broad categories: single-pass reasoners and multiple-pass reasoners. Single-pass models read a question and a source text once and often adopt the differentiable attention mechanism that emphasizes important parts of the context related to the question.\nBIDAF (Seo et al., 2017) represents one of\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n07 41\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 A\npr 2\n01 7\nthe state-of-the-art single-pass models in Machine Comprehension. BIDAF uses a bi-directional attention matrix which calculates the correlations between each word pair in context and query to build query-aware context representation. However, BIDAF and some similar models miss some questions because they don’t have the capacity to reflect on problematic candidate answers and revise their decisions.\nWhen humans are reading a text with the goal of answering a question, they tend to read it multiple times to get a better understanding of the context and question, and to give a better response.\nWith this intuition, recent multi-pass models revisit the question and the context passage (or ruminate) to infer the relations between the context, the question and the answer.\nWe propose an extension of BIDAF, called Ruminating Reader, which uses a second pass of reading and reasoning to allow it to learn to avoid mistakes and to ensure that it is able to effectively use the full context when selecting an answer. In addition to adding a second pass, we also introduce two novel layer types, the ruminate layers, which use gating mechanisms to fuse the obtained from the first and second passes. We observe a surprising phenomenon that when an LSTM layer in the context ruminate layer takes same input in each timestep, it can produce useful representation for the gates. In addition, we introduce an answer–question similarity loss to penalize overlap between question and predicted answer, a common feature in the errors of our base model. This allows us to achieve an F1 score of 79.5 and Exact Match (EM) score of 70.6 on hidden test set,1 an improvement of 2.2 F1 score and 2.9 EM on BIDAF. Figure 1 shows a high-level comparison between BIDAF and Ruminating Reader.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we define the problem to be solved and introduce the SQuAD task. In Section 3 we introduce Ruminating Reader, focusing on the informationextracting and information-digesting components and how they integrate. Section 4 discusses related work. Section 5 presents the experimental setting, results and analysis. Section 6 concludes."

Formally, the Training and development data consist of tuples (Q, P, A), where Q = (q1, ..., qi, ...q|Q|) is the question, a sequence of words with length |Q|, C = (c1, ...cj , ..., c|C|) is the context, a sequence of words with length |C|, and A = (ab, ae) is the answer span marking the beginning and end indices of the the answer in the context (1 <= ab <= ae <= |C|).\nSQuAD The SQuAD corpus is built using 536 articles randomly selected from English Wikipedia. Images, figures, tables are stripped and any paragraphs shorter than 500 characters are discarded. Unlike other datasets that such as CNN/Daily Mail whose questions are synthesized, Rajpurkar et al.

      "heading" : "3.1 Ruminating Reader",
      "text" : "In this section, we review the BIDAF model (Seo et al., 2017) and introduce our extension, the Ruminating Reader.\nOur additions to the base model are motivated by the intuition that adding an additional pass of reading will allow the model to better integrate information from the question and answer and to better weigh possible answers, and that by interpolating the results of the second pass with those of the first pass through gating, we can prevent the additional complexity that we add to the model from substantially increasing the difficulty of training. The structure of our model is shown in Figure 2 and explained in the following sections.\nCharacter Embedding Layer Just as in the base BIDAF model, the character embedding layer maps each word to a high dimensional vector using character features. It does so using a convolutional neural network with max pooling over learned character vectors (Lee et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2016). Thus we have a context character representation M ∈ Rf×C and a query representation N ∈ Rf×Q, where C is the sequence length of the context, Q is the sequence length of the query and f is the number of 1D convolutional neural network filters.\nWord Embedding Layer Again as in the base model, the word embedding layer uses pretrained word vectors (the 6B GloVe vectors of Pennington et al., 2014) to map the word into a high dimensional vector space. We do not update the word embeddings during training. The character embedding and the word embedding are concatenated and passed into a two-layer highway network (Srivastava et al., 2015) to obtain a d dimensional vector representation of each single word. Hence, we have a context representation H ∈ Rd×C and a query representation U ∈ Rd×Q.\nSequence Encoding Layers As in BIDAF, we use two LSTM RNNs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) with d-dimensional outputs to encode\nthe context and query representations in both directions. Therefore, we obtain a context encoding matrix C ∈ R2d×C , and a query encoding matrix Q ∈ R2d×Q.\nAttention Flow Layer As in BIDAF, the attention flow layer constructs a query-aware context representation G from inputs C and Q. This layer takes two steps. In the first step, an interaction matrix I ∈ RC×Q is computed, which indicates the affinities between each context word encoding and each query word encoding. Icq indicates the correlation between the c-th word in context and q-th word in query. The interaction matrix is computed by\nIcq = w > (I)[Cc;Qq;Cc ◦Qq] (1)\nwhere wI ∈ R6d is a trainable parameter, Cc is c-th column of context encoding and Qq is q-th column of query encoding, ◦ is elementwise multiplication, and [; ] is vector concatenation.\nContext-to-query Attention As in BIDAF, the context-to-query attention component generates, for each context word, an attention-weighted sum of query word encodings. Let Q̃ ∈ R2d×C represent the context-to-query attention matrix. For column c in Q̃ is defined by Q̃c = ∑ (acqQq), where a is the attention weight. a is computed by ac = softmax(Ic) ∈ RQ.\nQuery-to-context Attention Query-to-context attention indicates the most relevant context words to query. The most relevant word vector representation is an attention-weighted sum defined by c̃ = ∑ bcCc where b, is an attention weight which is calculated by b = softmax(maxcol(I)) ∈ RC . c̃ is replicated C times across the column, therefore giving C̃ ∈ R2d×C .\nWe then obtain the final query-aware context representation by\nGc = [Cc; Q̃c;Cc ◦ Q̃c;Cc ◦ C̃c] (2)\nwhere Gc ∈ R8d×C .\nSummarization Layer We propose summarization layer which produces a vector representation that summarizes the information in the queryaware context representation. The input to summarization layer is G. We use one bi-directional LSTM network to model the learned information. We select the final states from both directions and concatenate them together as s = [sf ; sb] . where\ns ∈ R2d represents the representation summarized from the reading of context and query, sf is the final state of LSTM in forward direction, and sb is the final state of LSTM in backward direction.\nQuery Ruminate Layer The query ruminate layer fuses the summarization vector representation with the query encoding Q, helping reformulate the query representation in order to maximize the chance of retrieving the correct answer. The input to this layer is s tiled Q times (SQ ∈ R2d×Q). A gating function then fuses this with the existing query encoding:\nzi = tanh(W 1> Qz SQi +W 2> Qz Qi + bQz) (3)\nfi = σ(W 1> Qf SQi +W 2> QfQi + bQf ) (4)\nQ̃i = fi ◦Qi + (1− fi) ◦ zi (5)\nwhere W 1Qz,W 2 Qz,W 1 Qf ,W 2 Qf ∈ R2d×2d and bQz, bQf ∈ R2d are trainable parameters, SQiis the i-th column of the SQ, Qi is the i-th column of Q.\nContext Ruminate Layer Context ruminate layer digests the summarization and integrates it with the context encoding C to facilitate answer extraction. In this layer, we tile s C times and we have SC ∈ R2d×C . To incorporate the positional information into this relatively long tiled sequence, we feed it into an additional bidirectional LSTM with output size d in each direction. This approach, while somewhat inefficient, proves to be an valuable addition to the model and allows it to better track position information, loosely following the positional encoding strategy of Sukhbaatar et al. (2015). Hence we obtain S̃C ∈ R2d×C , which is fused with context encoding C via a gate:\nzi = tanh(W 1> Cz S̃Ci +W 2> Cz Ci + bCz) (6)\nfi = σ(W 1> Cf S̃Ci +W 2> Cf Ci + bCf ) (7)\nC̃i = fi ◦Ci + (1− fi) ◦ zi (8)\nwhere W 1Cz,W 2 Cz,W 1 Cf ,W 2 Cf ∈ R2d×2d and bCz, bCf ∈ R2d are trainable parameters, S̃Ciis the i-th column of the S̃C , Ci is the i-th column of C.\nSecond Hop Attention Flow Layer We take Q̃ ∈ R2d×Q and C̃ ∈ R2d×C as the input to another attention flow layer with the same structure as described above, yielding G(2) ∈ R8d×C .\nModeling Layer We use two layers of bidirectional LSTM with output size d in each direction to aggregate the information in G(2), yielding a pre-output matrix M s ∈ R2d×C .\nOutput Layer As in BIDAF, our output layer independently models the probability of each word being selected as the start or end of an answer span. We calculate the probability distribution of the start index of the answer span by\nps = softmax(w>p1 [G;M s]) (9)\nwhere w(p1) ∈ R10d is a trainable parameter. We pass the matrix M s to another bi-directional LSTM with output size d in single direction yielding M e. We obtain the probability distribution of the end index of the answer span by\npe = softmax(w>(p2)[G;M e]) (10)\nTraining Loss We define the training loss as the sum of three components: negative log likelihood loss, L2 regularization loss, and a novel answer– question similarity loss.\nAnswer–Question Similarity Loss We observe that a version of our model trained only on the two standard loss terms often selects answers that overlap substantially in content with their corresponding questions, and that this nearly always results\nin an error. A sample error of this kind is shown in Table 1. This motivates an additional loss term at training time: We penalize the similarity between the question and the selected answer. Formally, the answer question similarity loss is defined as\ns = Argmax(p1) (11)\ne = Argmax(p2) (12)\n~qBoW = Sumrow(Q)\nQ (13)\nAQSL(θ) = cos(Cs, ~qBoW ) + cos(Ce, ~qBoW ) (14)\nwhere s refers to the start index of answer span, e refers to the end index of the answer span, ~qBoW is the bag of words representation of query encoding, cos(a, b) is the cosine similarity between a and b, Cs and Ce are the s-th and e-th vector representation of context encoding.\nPrediction During prediction, we use a local search strategy that for token indices a and a′, we maximize psa × pea′ , where 0 ≤ a′ − a ≤ 15 . Dynamic programming is applied during search, resulting in O(C) time complexity."

      "text" : "Recently, both QA and Cloze-style machine comprehension tasks like CNN/Daily Mail have seen fast progress. Much of this recent work has been based on end-to-end trained neural network models, and within that, most have used recurrent neural networks with soft attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015), which emphasizes one part of the data over the others. These models can be coarsely divided into two categories: single-pass and multi-pass reasoners.\nMost papers on single-pass reasoning systems propose novel ways to use the attention mechanism: Wang and Jiang (2016) propose matchLSTM to model the interaction between context and query, as well as introducing the use of a pointer network (Vinyals et al., 2015) to extract the answer span from the context. Xiong et al. (2017) propose the Dynamic Coattention Network, which uses co-dependent representations of the question and the context, and iteratively updates the\nstart and end indices to recover from local maxima and to find the optimal answer span. Wang et al. (2016) propose the Multi-Perspective Context Matching model that matches the encoded context with query by combining various matching strategies, aggregates matching vector with bidirectional LSTM, and predict start and end positions. In order to merge the entity score during its multiple appearence, Kadlec et al. (2016) propose attention-sum reader who computes dot product between context and query encoding, does a softmax operation over context and sums the probability over the same entity to favor the frequent entities over rare ones. Chen et al. (2016) propose to use a bilinear term to calculate the attentional alignment between context and query.\nAmong multi-hop reasoning systems: Hill et al. (2015) apply attention on window-based memory, by extending multi-hop end-to-end memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Dhingra et al. (2016) extend attention-sum reader to multi-turn reasoning with an added gating mechanism. The Iterative Alternative (IA) reader (Sordoni et al., 2016) produces query glimpse and document glimpse in each iterations and uses both glimpses to update recurrent state in each iteration. Shen et al. (2017) propose a multi-hop attention model that used reinforcement learning to dynamically determine when to stop digesting intermediate information and produce an answer."

      "heading" : "5.4 Analysis",
      "text" : "Layer Ablation Analysis To analyze how each component contribute to the model, we run a layer ablation experiment. We present results for twelve versions of the model on the development set, each missing some or all of the major components of the full Ruminating Reader. The precise definition of each of the twelve ablated models can be found in Appendix A.1.\nThe results of the ablation experiment are shown in Table 3. The ablation experiments show how each component contribute to the model. Experiments 3 and 4 show that the two ruminate layers are both important and helpful in contributing performance. It is worth noting that the BiLSTM in the context ruminate layer contributes substantially to model performance. We find this somewhat surprising, since it takes the same input in each timestep, but it nonetheless successfully digests the summarization information representation and produces a useful input for the gating component. Experiments 7 and 8 show that the\nmodeled summarization vector representation can provide information to gates reasonably well. The drop in performance in both experiments 9 and 10 shows that the key information for new query and context representation are the are first stage query and context encodings. Experiments 11 and 12 shows that the summarization vector representation does help the later stage of reasoning.\nVisualization Figure 3 provides a visualization of the first hop and second hop attention interaction matrix I . We also provide a sample of visualization for the L2 sum of gate value in context and query ruminate layers in Figure 4.\nFrom Figure 3 we see that though the structures of two hops of attention flow layer are the same, they function quite differently in typical cases. The first hop attention appears to be primarily concerned with identifying the key informative word (or words, as here) in the query. Though in Figure 3 four key words are signified, one or two words are attended to in the first hop in the common case. The second hop is then responsible for finding candidate answers that are relevant to those key words and generating a query-aware context representation. We observe the first hop attention shows a consistent attention pattern across context words, suggesting that there may be room to make the first hop component more efficient in future work.\nFrom Figure 4, we see the gate value on both query ruminate layer and context ruminate layer\nshows that the gates are working to fuse information to original query encoding and context encoding. We observe that in most of the case the gates in ruminate layers uses more information from encoding than from summarization representation. The observation matches our expectation that the gates modify and improve on the encoding representation.\nWe also provide a comparison of F1 score between BIDAF and Ruminating Reader on question with different ground truth answer length and different types of questions in Figure 5. Exact match score is highly correlated with F1 score so we omit it for clarity. We observe that the Ruminating Reader outperforms BIDAF on most of the questions with respect of different answer length. On the question with long answer length, of 5, 8 and 9, Ruminating Reader outperforms BIDAF by a great margin. Questions with longer reference answers appear to be more difficult to answer. In\naddition, the Ruminating Reader does better on each type of question. Both models work best for when questions—these question are answerable by temporal expressions, which are relatively easy to recognize. The Why questions are hardest to answer—they tend to have long answers with no purely lexical cues marking their beginnings or ends. Ruminating Reader outperforms BIDAF model on why questions by a substantial margin. Performance Breakdown Following Zhang et al. (2017), we break down Ruminating Reader’s 79.5% F1 score on the development set into three sub-scores, representing failures, partial successes, and successes. On 13.5% of development set examples, Ruminate Reader fails, yielding 0% F1. On 70.6% of examples, Ruminate Reader achieves a perfect F1 score. On the remaining 15.9%, Ruminate Reader got only partial matches (i.e., answers that partially overlapped with reference answers), with an average F1 score of 56.0%. Comparing to the jNet (Zhang et al., 2017) whose success answers occupy 69.1% of all answers, failure score answers 14.9% and partial success 16.01% with an average F1 score of 58.0%, our model works better on increasing successes and reducing failures."

    "abstractText" : "To answer the question in machine comprehension (MC) task, the models need to establish the interaction between the question and the context. To tackle the problem that the single-pass model cannot reflect on and correct its answer, we present Ruminating Reader. Ruminating Reader adds a second pass of attention and a novel information fusion component to the Bi-Directional Attention Flow model (BIDAF). We propose novel layer structures that construct an query-aware context vector representation and fuse encoding representation with intermediate representation on top of BIDAF model. We show that a multi-hop attention mechanism can be applied to a bi-directional attention structure. In experiments on SQuAD, we find that the Reader outperforms the BIDAF baseline by a substantial margin, and matches or surpasses the performance of all other published systems.",
