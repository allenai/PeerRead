Consider c1: Min=0.33, Max=1.20, Avg=0.86 Consider c2: Min=1.30, Max=3.29 Avg=2.39\nHere the avg value is comparatively high for c2. Max value is also high. So, we get the outlier object p6 as d(c2,p6)=3.29.\nTaking c3(9,2) as new cluster centroid, we reassign the objects in c1, c2 and c3 as shown in figure-5 below:\nFigure-5: Initials centroids c1,c2,c3\nNow we recalculate the centroids as shown in the figure-6 below:\nFigure-6: Modified centroids c1,c2,c3\nNow we calculate the intra-cluster distances for c1, c2 and c3. Consider c1: Min=0.33, Max=1.20, Avg=0.86 Consider c2: Min=0.71, Max=1.58, Avg=1.14 Consider c3: Min=0.67, Max=1.05, Avg=0.92 Here avg intra-cluster distances are similar for all three clusters, so we stop here.
