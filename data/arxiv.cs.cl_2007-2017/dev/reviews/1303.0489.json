To arrange and browse the document it becomes difficult. To overcome such problem the document preprocessing, term selection, attribute reduction and maintaining the relationship between the important terms using background knowledge, WordNet, becomes an important parameters in data mining. In these paper the different stages are formed, firstly the document preprocessing is done by removing stop words, stemming is performed using porter stemmer algorithm, word net thesaurus is applied for maintaining relationship between the important terms, global unique words, and frequent word sets get generated, Secondly, data matrix is formed, and thirdly terms are extracted from the documents by using term selection approaches tf-idf, tf-df, and tf2 based on their minimum threshold value. Further each and every document terms gets preprocessed, where the frequency of each term within the document is counted for representation. The purpose of this approach is to reduce the attributes and find the effective term selection method using WordNet for better clustering accuracy. Experiments are evaluated on Reuters Transcription Subsets, wheat, trade, money grain, and ship, Reuters 21578, Classic 30, 20 News group (atheism), 20 News group (Hardware), 20 News group (Computer Graphics) etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Mar 2013 12:19:18 GMT  (219kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0489v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["leena h patil", "mohammed atique"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0489"}
