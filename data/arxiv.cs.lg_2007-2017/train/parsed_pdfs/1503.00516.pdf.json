INTRODUCTION There is an increasing need to handle large multidimensional datasets that cannot easily be analyzed or processed using modern day computers. Due to the curse of dimensionality researchers need to investigate mathematical tools which can evaluate information beyond the properties of large matrices. The essential goal is to reduce the dimensionality of big data with minimal information loss. One such method is to approximate multidimensional datasets in terms of tensor decompositions [1]. This method has been of great interest within the last decade and successfully applied in a diverse range of research areas such as data classification [2], [3], computer vision [4], quantum many-body physics [5]–[10] and signal processing [11], [12].\nA popular method for tensor decomposition is the Tucker decomposition, which is an important tool for problems considering feature extraction, feature selection and classification of multilinear structures in large-scale multidimensional datasets. It has present applications in various fields such as neuroscience, pattern analysis, image classification and signal processing [2], [12], [13]. The central concept is to decompose a large multidimensional tensor into a set of common factors and a single core tensor of reduced\ndimension which approximately describes the features of the original tensor. The main disadvantages of using this decomposition is the computational exponential growth with the order of the tensor and the core tensor itself is still a multidimensional dataset. Hence, TD might be hampered when applied to study feature extraction and classification of big datasets represented by high-order tensors.\nIn this paper we solve the feature extraction and classification problem utilizing the matrix product state decomposition [8], [10] (also known as the tensor-train (TT) decomposition [14]). Note that previous literature has categorized that the MPS and TT decompositions [1] are equivalent, however the concept of MPS has already been used for decades in the field of quantum physics [15]–[17] prior to its introduction in the mathematics community. Since the concept of MPS was introduced from the point of view of quantum information theory [18], more specifically the quantum entanglement theory [5]–[8], it has been broadly applied to study problems in one-dimensional quantum many-body physics with great success.\nWhen comparing the MPS decomposition with the TD, the MPS decomposition has some significant advantages over the TD that can be employed to study the feature extraction and classification problem of big datasets. For instance, an MPS can be employed to represent a tensor which computational complexity increases polynomially with the increasing of the number of tensor orders as compared to the exponential growth in the case of using TD. In addition, due to its natural structure, an MPS is commonly represented by a set of local tensors of low orders, i.e. the maximum order of a local tensor is usually three, it allows us to update the local tensors modified by some local transformation without affecting the others. This is again a huge advantage in terms of saving computational complexity.\nTo benchmark our state-of-the-art method we have studied the pattern and image classification for a few well-known big datasets, e.g. the Columbia University Image Libraries COIL-20 [19] and COIL-100 [20], [21], and the Extended Yale B dataset [22] from the Computer Vision Laboratory located at the University of California San Diego. The results can be comparable with the ones obtained from other well-known methods. To our knowledge this is the\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n00 51\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n5\nfirst paper applying the MPS decomposition in computer vision, pattern recognition and data classification which rely on feature extraction, feature selection and classification. However, without any restriction, the method can be potentially applied to study other data mining problems such as compressive sensing or unsupervised learning.\nThe rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews mathematical foundation that will be used throughout the paper. In Section III we state the problem of pattern recognition and data classification of tensors and provide a mathematical analysis comparing both TD and MPS decomposition. In Section IV we describe the MPS algorithm in detail. In Section V we showcase the algorithm with several experiments in pattern and image classification. Lastly, Section VI concludes the paper."

      "text" : "A tensor is a multidimensional array and its order (also known as ways or modes) is the number of dimensions it contains. Zero-order tensors are scalars and denoted by lowercase letters, e.g., a. A first-order tensor is a vector, which we denote by boldface lowercase letters, e.g., a. A matrix is a tensor of order two and is defined by boldface capital letters, e.g., A. A higher-order tensor (tensors of order three and above) are denoted by boldface calligraphic letters, e.g., X . Therefore a general Nth-order tensor can be defined as X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN , where each Ii is the dimension of the local subspace i. We denote ai as the ith entry of a vector a and aij as an element of a matrix A. The element of a third-order tensor X is denoted as xijk and thus defined similarly for a general Nth-order tensor. Indices will range from 1 to their captial version, e.g., i = 1, . . . , I or δ = 1, . . . ,∆ for Greek letters. The nth element in a sequence of tensors is denoted with a superscript in parentheses, e.g., A(n) is the nth matrix. The n-mode matrix product of a tensor X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN and a matrix A ∈ RJ×In is denoted by X×nA, and results in an N th-order tensor of size I1×· · ·×In−1×J×In+1×· · ·×IN . The index notation is given by\n(X ×n A)i1···in−1jin+1···iN = In∑ in=1 xi1···in···iNajin . (1)\nThe multiplication in all possible modes (n = 1, . . . , N) of the tensor X with a set of matrices A(n) is denoted as\nX × {A} = X ×1 A(1) ×2 A(2) · · · ×N A(N). (2)\nThe matricization, also known as unfolding or flattening, is the procedure to transform a tensor into a matrix. The mode-n matricization of a tensor X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN is denoted by X(n) ∈ RIn×(I1···In−1In+1···IN ), which arranges the mode-n fibers to be the columns of the resulting matrix. The definition of reshaping a tensor X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN is changing from the N th-order to another order as long as the\nexact number of parameters is kept, e.g. the matricization of X to X(i1···in) is said to be reshaping X to a (i1 · · · in) × (in+1 · · · iN ) matrix.\nGraphical notation has been used extensively [10] in order to communicate more efficiently the ideas of tensor decompositions. In a tensor network diagram (TND), tensors are represented as shapes and their corresponding indices are lines protruding from these shapes as shown in Fig 1. A tensor contraction or Einstein summation can be performed by connecting common indices in the diagram. For example the n-mode matrix product defined in Eq. (1) can be easily converted to a TND shown in Fig 2. For the remainder of this paper we will use TND’s to support explanations."

      "text" : "Given an N th-order tensor X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN , the Tucker decomposition [1] is defined as\nX = G ×1 A(1) ×2 A(2) · · · ×N A(N) + E = G × {A}+ E (3)\nwhere G ∈ R∆1×∆2×···×∆N is known as the core tensor and each In ×∆n matrix A(n) (∆i ≤ Ii) is known as a factor matrix, E denotes the approximation error. For simplicity if we assume I1 = I2 = · · · = IN = I and ∆1 = ∆2 = · · · = ∆N = ∆, then the TD representation of X consists of O(NI∆ + ∆N ) parameters, which is exponential in N and thus is only suitable for small N . In feature extraction, for sets of K N th-order tensors X ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN , the TD can be considered as\nX (k) = G(k) ×1 A(1) ×2 A(2) · · · ×N A(N) + E(k), (4)\nwhere {A(i)}Ni=1 is the common set of factor matrices obtained for each core tensor X (k), for k = 1, . . . ,K. However, one can choose a more effective way to represent the TD for the set of all K N th-order tensors in a single equation by concatenating all tensors X (k) such that\nY = [X (1)X (2) · · ·X (K)] ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN×K (5)\nthen its TD is\nY = G ×1 A(1) ×2 A(2) · · · ×N A(N) + E, (6)\nwhere Y ,E ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN×K and G ∈ R∆1×∆2×···×∆N×K is an (N + 1)th-order tensor, see Fig. 3 for a TND of the core tensor and factor matrices. As we can see, the number of parameters in the core tensor increases exponentially with the number of orders N in\nthe tensor Y . Accordingly, this representation can make simulation intractable by increasing N . Alternatively, in what follows we apply a different decomposition to represent the tensor Y in terms of a MPS decomposition such that the number of parameters only depends polynomially in N , and more importantly the number of parameters in the core tensor does not directly depend on N ."

(5) is defined as\nyi1···k···iN = a (1) i1 · · ·A(n−1)in−1 A (n) k A (n+1) in+1 · · · a(M)iM (7)\nwhere the kth index is positioned at n and M = N + 1. For each k and ij (j 6= 1, N ), the corresponding matrix A(·) has the size ∆(j−1) × ∆j . For each i1, iM , a(1) and a(M) correspond to row and column vectors of size ∆1 and ∆(M−1), respectively. See Fig 4 for a TND of Eq. (7).\nGiven the assumptions of index sizes stated previously in Section III-B, the MPS consists of O((M − 2)I∆2 + 2I∆) parameters, which is polynomial in M . Also, if we choose ∆ = IM/2, the MPS can exactly represent the tensor Y without any approximation. However, this will result into a large computational complexity. In practice, when dealing with high dimensional tensors, the MPS decomposition is employed as an approximation representation of the tensor such that ∆ can be chosen to be much smaller than IM/2.\nIn the above MPS representation one can easily represent it in such a way that each link between the tensors can be described by an orthonormal base, this is known as a canonical MPS decomposition. For instance, an MPS is in a left-canonical form if it satisfies the following conditions∑\nin (A(in))†A(in) = I, (n = 2, . . . ,M − 1) (8)∑ in (a(in))†a(in) = I, (n = 1) (9)\nand right-canonical form if∑ in\nC(in)(C(in))† = I, (n = 2, . . . ,M − 1) (10)∑ in c(in)(c(in))† = I, (n = M) (11)\nwhere I is the identity matrix and (A(in))† represents the comjugate transpose of A(in). These conditions can be visualized as diagrams shown in Fig. 5.\nThere is also a mixed-canonical form which can be used for feature extraction and classification. In this form the tensors to the left and right of A(n) are the factor matrices/vectors A/a and C/c, which satisfy left- and rightcanonical form conditions, respectively. We also relabel A(n) to G to highlight that it is the core tensor consisting of K matrices, see Fig. 6.\nRecall that in feature extraction for K N th-order training data we need to find the MPS decomposition of Y defined in Eq. (5). As it will be shown later, by representing the MPS in the mixed-canonical form, we can extract the core tensor and the common factors of Y directly. Furthermore, the order of the core tensor is independent of N which is contrary to the case of using TD."

We then apply the alternating least squares (ALS) method to find the optimal MPS representation of the training data tensor which contains the core tensor and the basis factors. Using the basis factors from the MPS of training data, we can extract the core tensor for the test data tensor. In Section V we will apply classification methods to train the classification model with the training\ncore tensor and then proceed to classify the test data based on the test core tensor."

      "heading" : "A. Mixed-canonical form of the MPS",
      "text" : "Suppose that the training data is represented by an (N + 1)th-order tensor Y defined in Eq. (5). The algorithm to obtain the mixed-canonical MPS decomposition of Y is divided into two sweeps (left-to-right and right-to-left) of an iterative SVD algorithm. These sweeps are needed to find each of the left-canonical and right-canonical common factors of the MPS decomposition. Each sweep is completed when the next index to be evaluated is k, which will be the core tensor.\nAssume that the k index is positioned at n. The following two steps are performed consecutively to obtain the mixedcanonical form:\n1) Left-to-right sweep: The left-to-right sweep involves acquiring common factors 1, . . . , n − 1 in left-canonical form. First perform a mode-i1 matricization on Y to obtain the matrix Z = Y(1) of size I1 × (I2..K..IM ). In terms of elements, yi1..k..iM = zi1,(i2..k..iM ), then the SVD of Z gives\nyi1..k..iM = zi1,(i2..k..iM )\n= ∆1∑ δ1=1 ui1,δ1dδ1,δ1v ∗ δ1,(i2..k..iM )\n= ∆1∑ δ1=1 a (1) i1,δ1 tδ1,(i2..k..iM ). (12)\nIn Eq. (12) T = DV† and since U is left-orthogonal and contains the index i1, we let a(1) = U be the first common factor. Next reshape T to a (∆1I2) × (I3..K..IM ) matrix, then the SVD of T gives,\nyi1..k..iM = ∆1,∆2∑ δ1,δ2=1 a (1) i1,δ1 u(δ1i2),δ2dδ2,δ2v ∗ δ2,(i3..k..iM )\n= ∆1,∆2∑ δ1,δ2=1 a (1) i1,δ1 a (2) δ1,i2,δ2 tδ2,(i3..k..iM ). (13)\nSimilar to Eq. (12), in Eq. (13) we had T = DV† and since U is left-orthogonal, we obtain common factor A(2) of dimension ∆1 × I2 × ∆2 from reshaping U to a thirdorder tensor. The process above is repeated until we obtain all common factors up to A(n−1) and the last T matrix has dimension ∆n−1 × (K..IM ).\n2) Right-to-left sweep: The right-to-left sweep involves acquiring common factors n + 1, . . . ,M in right-canonical form. The last T matrix from the left-to-right sweep is reshaped to (∆n−1K..IM−1)× IM and its SVD leads to a right-orthogonal common factor c(M) = V†. Consequently we acquire common factors n+1, . . . ,M−1 by performing successive SVD’s and at each instance reshaping the right\northogonal matrix V† to a third-order tensor. Finally, reshape the last T matrix of dimension (∆n−1K) × ∆n to a third order tensor to obtain the core tensor G as shown in the following equations,\nyi1..k..iM = ∆n−1,∆n∑ δn−1,δn=1 Lt(δn−1k)δnR (14)\n= ∆n−1,∆n∑ δn−1,δn=1 Lgδn−1,k,δnR (15)\nwith\nL = ∆1,...,∆n−2∑ δ1,...,δn−2=1 a (1) i1,δ1 · · · a(n−1)δn−2,in−1,δn−1 (16)\nand\nR = ∆n+1,...,∆M−1∑ δn+1,...,δM−1=1 a (n+1) δn,in+1,δn+1 · · · a(M)δM−1,iM (17)\nEq. (15) is the mixed-canonical form of Y and an example of the two-step process for a (6 + 1)th-order tensor can be seen in Fig. 7. Hence we have completed Step 1 of the the feature extraction and classification problem.\nNote that the position of the core tensor n can be varied. Intuitively it is better to position the core tensor between two indices where it can achieve the maximum bond dimension so as to increase the number of features available to the core tensor.\nAn ALS method can be used to variationally optimize each of the common factors. After the ALS procedure is completed, to ensure we can extract the training core tensor with minimal error it is important to be certain that the MPS decomposition is in mixed-canonical form. This can be achieved by using an iterative sweep on the MPS as explained in detail by Schollwöck [9]."

(18)\nSubsequently the test core tensor can be extracted from this concatenated tensor by projecting common factors. The resultant test core tensor will also be third-order and consist of the same dimension of features as the training core tensor.

The results were averaged over 10 trials.\n3) Extended Yale Face database B: The database contains 16128 grayscale images with 28 human subjects under 9 poses, where for each pose there is 64 illumination conditions. Similar to [3], to improve computational time each image was cropped to keep only the center area containing the face, then resized to 73 x 55. Training data and test data was not selected randomly but partitioned according to poses. For training and test data we selected poses 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 and 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively. For a single subject the training tensor was size 5 × 73 × 55 × 64 and the test tensor was size 4× 73× 55× 64.

In all experiments a small bond dimension was only needed to achieve high classification accuracies, however the accuracy does not necessarily increase at higher bond dimensions. This is because a larger number of features does not necessarily correlate to increased classification performance.\nIn the COIL-20 and COIL-100 results it was expected that larger hold/out ratios decreases the classification performance and this can be seen by the decreased accuracies at a hold/out ratio of 95%. For COIL-100 our algorithm outperformed several methods [23]–[25] at the 75% hold/out ratio. This is also using the full color image as opposed to the converted grayscale image for these experiments.\nThe classification performance for the Extended Yale\nFace database B (EYFB) is much more stable, has lower computational complexity, and has higher classification accuracies from low to high bond dimensions compared to Direct General Tensor Discriminant Analysis (DGTDA) and Constrained Multilinear Discriminant Analysis (CMDA) proposed recently by Li & Schonfeld [3] as well as other methods mentioned in their paper.\nIt is imperative to highlight that the experiments conducted are not meant to outperform all current techniques in image and pattern analysis but to show that the MPS decomposition can be used to represent a generic multidimensional dataset using low-order tensors with polynomial computational complexity."

There is a rising interest in the use of tensor decompositions to approximate large tensors in order to reduce their dimensions by selecting important features for classification. Of particular interest is the Tucker decomposition (TD), which has already been applied in neuroscience, geoscience, signal processing, pattern and image recognition. However the decomposition itself leads to exponential computational time for high-order tensors. To circumvent this obstacle we propose an alternative known as the matrix product state (MPS) decomposition for the data representation of big data tensors. This decomposition has been used extensively in quantum physics within the last decade and its benefit has surprisingly not been seen in other areas of research. We prove that the MPS decomposition for feature extraction and classification in supervised learning can be implemented efficiently with high classification rates in pattern and image recognition.
