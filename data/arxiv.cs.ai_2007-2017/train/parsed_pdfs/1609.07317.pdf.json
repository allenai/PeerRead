      "text" : "The recurrent sequence-to-sequence paradigm for natural language generation (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014) has achieved remarkable recent success and is now the approach of choice for applications such as machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015), caption generation (Xu et al., 2015) and speech recognition (Chorowski et al., 2015). While these models have developed sophisticated conditioning mechanisms, e.g. attention, fundamentally they are discriminative models trained only to approximate the conditional output distribution of strings. In this paper we explore modelling the\njoint distribution of string pairs using a deep generative model and employing a discrete variational autoencoder (VAE) for inference (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Rezende et al., 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014). We evaluate our generative approach on the task of sentence compression. This approach provides both alternative supervised objective functions and the opportunity to perform semi-supervised learning by exploiting the VAEs ability to marginalise the latent compressed text for unlabelled data.\nAuto-encoders (Rumelhart et al., 1985) are a typical neural network architecture for learning compact data representations, with the general aim of performing dimensionality reduction on embeddings (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006). In this paper, rather than seeking to embed inputs as points in a vector space, we describe them with explicit natural language sentences. This approach is a natural fit for summarisation tasks such as sentence compression. According to this, we propose a generative auto-encoding sentence compression (ASC) model, where we introduce a latent language model to provide the variablelength compact summary. The objective is to perform Bayesian inference for the posterior distribution of summaries conditioned on the observed utterances. Hence, in the framework of VAE, we construct an inference network as the variational approximation of the posterior, which generates compression samples to optimise the variational lower bound.\nThe most common family of variational autoencoders relies on the reparameterisation trick, which is not applicable for our discrete latent language model. Instead, we employ the REINFORCE algorithm (Mnih et al., 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014)\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n07 31\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Se\np 20\nto mitigate the problem of high variance during sampling-based variational inference. Nevertheless, when directly applying the RNN encoder-decoder to model the variational distribution it is very difficult to generate reasonable compression samples in the early stages of training, since each hidden state of the sequence would have |V | possible words to be sampled from. To combat this we employ pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015) to construct the variational distribution. This biases the latent space to sequences composed of words only appearing in the source sentence (i.e. the size of softmax output for each state becomes the length of current source sentence), which amounts to applying an extractive compression model for the variational approximation.\nIn order to further boost the performance on sentence compression, we employ a supervised forcedattention sentence compression model (FSC) trained on labelled data to teach the ASC model to generate compression sentences. The FSC model shares the pointer network of the ASC model and combines a softmax output layer over the whole vocabulary. Therefore, while training on the sentencecompression pairs, it is able to balance copying a word from the source sentence with generating it from the background distribution. More importantly, by jointly training on the labelled and unlabelled datasets, this shared pointer network enables the model to work in a semi-supervised scenario. In\nthis case, the FSC teaches the ASC to generate reasonable samples, while the pointer network trained on a large unlabelled data set helps the FSC model to perform better abstractive summarisation.\nIn Section 6, we evaluate the proposed model by jointly training the generative (ASC) and discriminative (FSC) models on the standard Gigaword sentence compression task with varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled data. The results demonstrate that by introducing a latent language variable we are able to match the previous benchmakers with small amount of the supervised data. When we employ our mixed discriminative and generative objective with all of the supervised data the model significantly outperforms all previously published results."

      "text" : "In the ASC model there are two sets of parameters, φ and θ, that need to be updated during inference. Due to the non-differentiability of the model, the reparameterisation trick of the VAE is not applicable in this case. Thus, we use the REINFORCE algorithm (Mnih et al., 2014; Mnih and Gregor, 2014) to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator.\nThe variational lower bound of the ASC model is:\nL =Eqφ(c|s)[log pθ(s|c)]−DKL[qφ(c|s)||p(c)] 6 log ∫ qφ(c|s) qφ(c|s) pθ(s|c)p(c)dc = log p(s) (11)\nTherefore, by optimising the lower bound (Eq. 11), the model balances the selection of keywords for the summaries and the efficacy of the composed compressions, corresponding to the reconstruction error and KL divergence respectively.\nIn practise, the pre-trained language model prior p(c) prefers short sentences for compressions. As one of the drawbacks of VAEs, the KL divergence term in the lower bound pushes every sample drawn from the variational distribution towards the prior.\n2The recurrent parameters of the compressor are not updated by the gradients from the reconstruction model.\nThus acting to regularise the posterior, but also to restrict the learning of the encoder. If the estimator keeps sampling short compressions during inference, the LSTM decoder would gradually rely on the contexts from the decoded words instead of the information provided by the compressions, which does not yield the best performance on sentence compression.\nHere, we introduce a co-efficient λ to scale the learning signal of the KL divergence: L=Eqφ(c|s)[log pθ(s|c)]−λDKL[qφ(c|s)||p(c)] (12)\nAlthough we are not optimising the exact variational lower bound, the ultimate goal of learning an effective compression model is mostly up to the reconstruction error. In Section 6, we empirically apply λ = 0.1 for all the experiments on ASC model. Interestingly, λ controls the compression rate of the sentences which can be a good point to be explored in future work.\nDuring the inference, we have different strategies for updating the parameters of φ and θ. For the parameters θ in the reconstruction model, we directly update them by the gradients:\n∂L ∂θ = Eqφ(c|s)[ ∂ log pθ(s|c) ∂θ ]\n≈ 1 M ∑ m ∂ log pθ(s|c(m)) ∂θ\n(13)\nwhere we draw M samples c(m) ∼ qφ(c|s) independently for computing the stochastic gradients.\nFor the parameters φ in the compression model, we firstly define the learning signal,\nl(s, c) = log pθ(s|c)− λ(log qφ(c|s)− log p(c)).\nThen, we update the parameters φ by:\n∂L ∂φ = Eqφ(c|s)[l(s, c) ∂ log qφ(c|s) ∂φ ]\n≈ 1 M ∑ m [l(s, c(m)) ∂ log qφ(c (m)|s) ∂φ ] (14)\nHowever, this gradient estimator has a big variance because the learning signal l(s, c(m)) relies on the samples from qφ(c|s). Therefore, following the REINFORCE algorithm, we introduce two baselines b and b(s), the centred learning signal and inputdependent baseline respectively, to help reduce the variance.\nHere, we build an MLP to implement the inputdependent baseline b(s). During training, we learn the two baselines by minimising the expectation:\nEqφ(c|s)[(l(s, c)− b− b(s)) 2]. (15)\nHence, the gradients w.r.t. φ are derived as,\n∂L ∂φ ≈ 1 M ∑ m (l(s, c(m))−b−b(s)) ∂ log qφ(c (m)|s) ∂φ\n(16) which is basically a likelihood-ratio estimator."

      "text" : "In neural variational inference, the effectiveness of training largely depends on the quality of the inference network gradient estimator. Although we introduce a biased estimator by using pointer networks, it is still very difficult for the compression model to generate reasonable natural language sentences at the early stage of learning, which results in\nhigh-variance for the gradient estimator. Here, we introduce our supervised forced-attention sentence compression (FSC) model to teach the compression model to generate coherent compressed sentences.\nNeither directly replicating the pointer network of ASC model, nor using a typical sequence-tosequence model, the FSC model employs a forceattention strategy (Figure 2) that encourages the compressor to select words appearing in the source sentence but keeps the original full output vocabulary V . The force-attention strategy is basically a combined pointer network that chooses whether to select a word from the source sentence s or to predict a word from V at each recurrent state. Hence, the combined pointer network learns to copy the source words while predicting the word sequences of compressions. By sharing the pointer networks between the ASC and FSC model, the biased estimator obtains further positive biases by training on a small set of labelled source-compression pairs.\nHere, the FSC model makes use of the compression model (Eq. 1 to 4) in the ASC model,\nαj =softmax(uj), (17)\nwhere αj(i), i ∈ (1, . . . , |s|) denotes the probability of selecting si as the prediction for cj .\nOn the basis of the pointer network, we further introduce the probability of predicting cj that is selected from the full vocabulary,\nβj = softmax(Wh c j), (18)\nwhere βj(w), w ∈ (1, . . . , |V |) denotes the probability of selecting the wth from V as the prediction for cj . To combine these two probabilities in the RNN, we define a selection factor t for each state output, which computes the semantic similarities between the current state and the attention vector,\nηj = ∑|s|\ni αj(i)h\ne i (19)\ntj = σ(η T jMh c j). (20)\nHence, the probability distribution over compressed words is defined as,\np(cj |c1:j−1, s)= { tjαj(i) + (1− tj)βj(cj), cj=si (1− tj)βj(cj), cj 6∈s\n(21)\nEssentially, the FSC model is the extended compression model of ASC by incorporating the pointer network with a softmax output layer over the full vocabulary. So we employ φ to denote the parameters of the FSC model pφ(c|s), which covers the parameters of the variational distribution qφ(c|s)."

(2015) carries out extractive summarisation via deletion with LSTMs, while Rush et al. (2015) applies a convolutional encoder and an\nattentional feed-forward decoder to generate abstractive summarises, which provides the benchmark for the Gigaword dataset. Nallapati et al. (2016) further improves the performance by exploring multiple variants of RNN encoder-decoder models. The recent works Gulcehre et al. (2016), Nallapati et al. (2016) and Gu et al. (2016) also apply the similar idea of combining pointer networks and softmax output. However, different from all these discriminative models above, we explore generative models for sentence compression. Instead of training the discriminative model on a big labelled dataset, our original intuition of introducing a combined pointer networks is to bridge the unsupervised generative model (ASC) and supervised model (FSC) so that we could utilise a large additional dataset, either labelled or unlabelled, to boost the compression performance. Dai and Le (2015) also explored semi-supervised sequence learning, but in a pure deterministic model focused on learning better vector representations.\nRecently variational auto-encoders have been applied in a variety of fields as deep generative models. In computer vision Kingma and Welling (2014), Rezende et al. (2014), and Gregor et al. (2015) have demonstrated strong performance on the task of image generation and Eslami et al. (2016) proposed variable-sized variational auto-encoders to identify multiple objects in images. While in natural language processing, there are variants of VAEs on modelling documents (Miao et al., 2016), sentences (Bowman et al., 2015) and discovery of relations (Marcheggiani and Titov, 2016). Apart from the typical initiations of VAEs, there are also a series of works that employs generative models for supervised learning tasks. For instance, Ba et al. (2015) learns visual attention for multiple objects by optimising a variational lower bound, Kingma et al. (2014) implements a semi-supervised framework for image classification and Miao et al. (2016) applies a conditional variational approximation in the task of factoid question answering. Dyer et al. (2016) proposes a generative model that explicitly extracts syntactic relationships among words and phrases which further supports the argument that generative models can be a statistically efficient method for learning neural networks from small data."

This dataset was generated by pairing the headline of each article with its first sentence to create a source-compression pair. Rush et al. (2015) provided scripts4 to filter out outliers, resulting in roughly 3.8M training pairs, a 400K validation set, and a 400K test set. In the following experiments all models are trained on the training set with different data sizes5 and tested on a 2K subset, which is identical to the test set used by Rush et al. (2015) and Nallapati et al. (2016). We decode the sentences by k = 5 Beam search and test with full-length Rouge score.\nFor the ASC and FSC models, we use 256 for the dimension of both hidden units and lookup tables. In the ASC model, we apply a 3-layer bidirectional RNN with skip connections as the encoder, a 3-layer RNN pointer network with skip connections as the compressor, and a 1-layer vanilla RNN with soft attention as the decoder. The language model prior is trained on the article sentences of the full training set using a 3-layer vanilla RNN with 0.5 dropout. To lower the computational cost, we apply different vocabulary sizes for encoder and compressor (119,506 and 68,897) which corresponds to the settings of Rush et al. (2015). Specifically, the vocabulary of the decoder is filtered by taking the most frequent 10,000 words from the vocabulary of the encoder, where the rest of the words are tagged as ‘<unk>’. In further consideration of efficiency, we use only one sample for the gradient estimator. We optimise the model by Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a 0.0002 learning rate and 64 sentences per batch. The model converges in 5 epochs. Except for the pretrained language model, we do not use dropout or embedding initialisation for ASC and FSC models."

Interestingly, learning on the unlabelled data largely increases the precisions (though the recalls do not benefit from it) which leads to significant improvements on the F-1 Rouge scores.

      "heading" : "7 Discussion",
      "text" : "From the perspective of generative models, a significant contribution of our work is a process for reducing variance for discrete sampling-based variational inference. The first step is to introduce two baselines in the control variates method due to the fact that the reparameterisation trick is not applica-\nble for discrete latent variables. However it is the second step of using a pointer network as the biased estimator that makes the key contribution. This results in a much smaller state space, bounded by the length of the source sentence (mostly between 20 and 50 tokens), compared to the full vocabulary. The final step is to apply the FSC model to transfer the knowledge learned from the supervised data to the pointer network. This further reduces the sampling variance by acting as a sort of bootstrap or constraint on the unsupervised latent space which could encode almost anything but which thus becomes biased towards matching the supervised distribution. By using these variance reduction methods, the ASC model is able to carry out effective variational inference for the latent language model so that it learns to summarise the sentences from the large unlabelled training data.\nIn a different vein, according to the reinforcement learning interpretation of sequence level training (Ranzato et al., 2016), the compression model of the ASC model acts as an agent which iteratively generates words (takes actions) to compose the com-\npression sentence and the reconstruction model acts as the reward function evaluating the quality of the compressed sentence which is provided as a reward signal. Ranzato et al. (2016) presents a thorough empirical evaluation on three different NLP tasks by using additional sequence-level reward (BLEU and Rouge-2) to train the models. In the context of this paper, we apply a variational lower bound (mixed reconstruction error and KL divergence regularisation) instead of the explicit Rouge score. Thus the ASC model is granted the ability to explore unlimited unlabelled data resources. In addition we introduce a supervised FSC model to teach the compression model to generate stable sequences instead of starting with a random policy. In this case, the pointer network that bridges the supervised and unsupervised model is trained by a mixed criterion of REINFORCE and cross-entropy in an incremental learning framework. Eventually, according to the experimental results, the joint ASC and FSC model is able to learn a robust compression model by exploring both labelled and unlabelled data, which outperforms the other single discriminative compression models that are only trained by cross-entropy reward signal."

The evaluation results show that supervised training of the combination of these models improves upon the state-of-the-art performance for the Gigaword compression dataset. When we train the supervised FSC model on a small amount of labelled data and the unsupervised ASC model on a large set of unlabelled data the combined model is able to outperform previously reported benchmarks trained on a great deal more supervised data.

    "abstractText" : "In this work we explore deep generative models of text in which the latent representation of a document is itself drawn from a discrete language model distribution. We formulate a variational auto-encoder for inference in this model and apply it to the task of compressing sentences. In this application the generative model first draws a latent summary sentence from a background language model, and then subsequently draws the observed sentence conditioned on this latent summary. In our empirical evaluation we show that generative formulations of both abstractive and extractive compression yield state-of-the-art results when trained on a large amount of supervised data. Further, we explore semi-supervised compression scenarios where we show that it is possible to achieve performance competitive with previously proposed supervised models while training on a fraction of the supervised data.",
