We present multimodal sparse coding for learning feature representations shared across multiple modalities. The shared representations are applied to multimedia event detection (MED) and evaluated in comparison to unimodal counterparts, as well as other feature learning methods such as GMM supervectors and sparse RBM.

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Multimedia Event Detection (MED) aims to identify complex activities occurring at a specific place and time involving various interactions of human actions and objects. MED is considered more difficult than concept analysis such as action recognition and has received significant attention in computer vision and machine learning research. In this paper, we propose the use of sparse coding for multimodal feature learning in the context of MED. Originally proposed to explain neurons encoding sensory information [7], sparse coding provides an unsupervised method to learn basis vectors for efficient data representation. More recently, sparse coding has been used to model the relationship between correlated data sources. By jointly training dictionaries with audio and video tracks from the same multimedia clip, we can force the two modalities to share a similar sparse representation whose benefit includes robust detection and cross-modality retrieval.\nIn the next section, we will describe audio-video feature learning in various unimodal and multimodal settings for sparse coding. We then present our experiments with TRECVID MED dataset. We will discuss the empirical results, compare them to other methods, and conclude."

      "text" : "In summary, our approach is to build feature vectors by sparse coding on the low-level audio and video features. Multiple feature vectors (i.e., sparse codes) are aggregated via max pooling. The resulting pooled feature vectors can scale to file level, and we use them to train an array of classifiers for MED.\n*This work was sponsored by the Department of Defense under Air Force Contract FA8721-05-C-0002.

      "heading" : "2.1 Low-level feature extraction and preprocessing",
      "text" : "We begin by locating the keyframes of a given multimedia clip. We apply a simple two-pass algorithm that computes color histogram difference of any two successive frames and determines a keyframe candidate based on the threshold calculated on the mean and standard deviation of the histogram differences. We examine the number of different colors present in the keyframe candidates and discard the ones with less than 26 colors. This ensures that our keyframes are not all-black or all-white blank images.\nAround each keyframe, we extract 5-sec audio data and additional 10 uniformly sampled video frames within the duration as illustrated in Figure 1a. If extracted audio is stereo, we take only the left channel. The audio waveform is resampled to 22.05 kHz and regularized by the time-frequency automatic gain control (TF-AGC) to balance the energy in sub-bands. We form audio frames using a 46-msec Hann window with 50% overlap between successive frames for smoothing. For each frame, we compute 16 the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) as the low-level audio feature. In addition, we append 16 delta cepstral and 16 delta-delta cepstral coefficients, which make our lowlevel audio feature vectors 48 dimensional. Finally, we apply PCA whitening before unsupervised learning. The complete audio preprocessing steps are described in Figure 1b.\nFor video preprocessing, we take a deep learning approach. We have tried out pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models and ended up choosing VGG ILSVRC 19 layers, the 19- layer model by University of Oxford’s Visual Geometry Group (VGG) [9] for the ImageNet Largescale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). As depicted in Figure 1c, we run the CNN feedforward passes with the extracted video frames. For each video frame, we take 4,096-dimensional hidden activation from fc7, the highest hidden layer before the final ReLU (i.e., the rectification non-linearity). By PCA whitening, we reduce the dimensionality to 128."

      "text" : "We use sparse coding to model high-level features that can train classifiers for event detection.\nUnimodal feature learning. A straightforward approach for sparse coding with two heterogeneous data modalities is to learn a separate dictionary of basis vectors for each modality. Figure 2 depicts unimodal sparse coding schemes. Recall the preprocessed audio and video input vectors xA and xV. Audio-only sparse coding is done by\nmin DA,y (i) A nA∑ i=1 ‖x(i)A −DAy (i) A ‖ 2 2 + λ‖y (i) A ‖1 (1)\nwhere we feed nA unlabeled audio examples to simultaneously learn the unimodal dictionary DA and sparse codes y(i)A under the sparsity regularization parameter λ. (We denote x (i) A the ith training example for audio.) Similarly, using nV unlabeled video examples, we learn\nmin DV,y (i) V nV∑ i=1 ‖x(i)V −DVy (i) V ‖ 2 2 + λ‖y (i) V ‖1. (2)\nWe can form yA+V = [yA yV]>, a union of the audio and video feature vectors from unimodal sparse coding illustrated in Figure 2c.\nMultimodal feature learning. The feature union yA+V encapsulates both audio and video sparse codes. However, the training is done in a parallel, unimodal fashion such that sparse coding dictionary for each modality is learned independently of the other. To remedy the lack of joint learning, we propose a multimodal sparse coding scheme described in Figure 3a. We use the joint sparse coding technique used in image super-resolution [11]\nmin DAV,y (i) AV n∑ i=1 ‖x(i)AV −DAVy (i) AV‖ 2 2 + λ ′‖y(i)AV‖1. (3)\nHere, we feed the concatenated audio-video input vector x(i)AV = [ 1√ NA x (i) A 1√ NV x (i) V ] >, where NA and NV are dimensionalities of xA and xV, respectively. As an interesting property, we can decompose the jointly learned dictionary DAV = [ 1√NADAV−A 1√ NV DAV−V] > to perform the following audio-only and video-only sparse coding\nmin DAV−A,y (i) AV−A nA∑ i=1 ‖x(i)AV−A −DAV−Ay (i) AV−A‖ 2 2 + λ ′′‖y(i)AV−A‖1, (4)\nmin DAV−V,y (i) AV−V nV∑ i=1 ‖x(i)AV−V −DAV−Vy (i) AV−V‖ 2 2 + λ ′′‖y(i)AV−V‖1. (5)\nIn principle, joint sparse coding via Eq. (3) combines the objectives of Eqs. (4) and (5), forcing the sparse codes y(i)AV−A and y (i) AV−V to share the same representation. Note the relationship between the\nregularization parameters λ′ = ( 1NA + 1 NV )λ′′. Ideally, we could have y(i)AV = y (i) AV−A = y (i) AV−V, although empirical values determined by the three different optimizations differ in reality. Feature formation possibilities on multimodal sparse coding are explained in Figure 3."

There are 20 event classes (E021 to E040) with event names such as “Bike trick,” “Dog show,” and “Marriage proposal.” For evaluation, we compute classification accuracy and mean average precision (mAP) metrics according to the NIST standard on the following experiments:\n1.

We evaluate the performance of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) [8] under similar unimodal and multimodal settings. For GMM, we use the expectation-maximization (EM) to fit the preprocessed input vectors xA, xV, xAV in 512 mixtures and form GMM supervectors [4] as feature that contain posterior probabilities with respect to each Gaussian. The max-pooled GMM supervectors are applied to train linear SVMs. We adopt the shallow bimodal pretraining model by Ngiam et al. [6] for RBM. Activations from the hidden layer of a size 512 are also max pooled before SVM. We have applied a target sparsity of 0.1 to both GMM and RBM."

For the 10Ex/100Ex experiment, we have used the best parameter setting from the 10Ex cross-validation to test 100Ex examples. In general, we observe that the union of audio and video feature vectors perform better than using only unimodal or cross-modal features. The union schemes perform better than the joint schemes. The union schemes, however, double feature dimensionality (i.e., from 512 to 1,024) since our union operation concatenates the two feature vectors. Joint feature vector is an economical way of combining both the audio and video features while keeping the same dimensionality as audio-only or video-only.\nIn Table 2, we report the mean accuracy and mAP for GMM and RBM under the union and joint feature learning schemes on the 10Ex/100Ex experiment. Our results show that sparse coding is better than GMM by 5–6% in accuracy and 7–8% in mAP. However, we find that the performance of RBM is on par with sparse coding. This leaves us a good next step to develop joint feature learning scheme for RBM."
