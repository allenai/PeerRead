{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Recurrent Inference Machines for Solving Inverse Problems", "abstract": "Inverse problems are typically solved by first defining a model and then choosing an inference procedure. With this separation of modeling from inference, inverse problems can be framed in a modular way. For example, variational inference can be applied to a broad class of models. The modularity, however, typically goes away after model parameters have been trained under a chosen inference procedure. During training, model and inference often interact in a way that the model parameters will ultimately be adapted to the chosen inference procedure, posing the two components inseparable after training. But if model and inference become inseperable after training, why separate them in the first place?  We propose a novel learning framework which abandons the dichotomy between model and inference. Instead, we introduce Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM), a class of recurrent neural networks (RNN) that directly learn to solve inverse problems.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIMs in experiments on various image reconstruction tasks. We show empirically that RIMs exhibit the desirable convergence behavior of classical inference procedures, and that they can outperform state-of- the-art methods when trained on specialized inference tasks.  Our approach bridges the gap between inverse problems and deep learning, providing a framework for fast progression in the field of inverse problems.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper presents a method to learn both a model and inference procedure at the same time with recurrent neural networks in the context of inverse problems.\nThe proposed method is interesting and results are quite good.

", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes the RIMs that unrolls variational inference procedure. \n\nThe author claims that the novelty lies in the separation of the model and inference procedure, making the MAP inference as an end-to-end approach. The effectiveness is shown in image restoration experiments.\n\nWhile unrolling the inference is not new, the author does raise an interesting perspective towards the `model-free' configuration, where model and inference are not separable and can be learnt jointly. \n\nHowever I do not quite agree the authors' argument regarding [1] and [2]. Although both [1] and [2] have pre-defined MAP inference problem. It is not necessarily that a separate step is required. In fact, both do not have either a pre-defined prior model or an explicit prior evaluation step as shown in Fig. 1(a). I believe that the implementation of both follows the same procedure as the proposed, that could be explained through Fig. 1(c). That is to say, the whole inference procedure eventually becomes a learnable neural network and the energy is implicitly defined through learning the parameters.  \n\nMoreover, the RNN block architecture (GRU) and non-linearity (tanh) restrict the flexibility and implicitly form the inherent family of variational energy and inference algorithm. This is also similar with [1] and [2].\n\nBased on that fact, I have the similar feeling with R1 that the novelty is somewhat limited. Also some discussions should be added in terms of the architecture and nonlinearity that you have chosen.

As R3 also notes, un-rolled networks for iterative inference aren't new: they've been used to replace CRF-type inference, and _also_ to solve image inverse problems (my refs [1-3]). Therefore, I'd argue that the fundamental idea proposed by the paper isn't new---it is just that the paper seeks to 'formalize' it as an approach for inverse problems (although, there is nothing specific about the analysis that ties it to inverse problems: the paper only shows that the RIM can express gradient descent over prior + likelihood objective).\n\nI also did not find the claims about benefits over prior approaches very compelling. The comment about parameter sharing works both ways---it is possible that untying the parameters leads to better performance over a fewer number of 'iterations', and given that the 'training set' is synthetically generated, learning a larger number of parameters doesn't seem to be an issue. Also, I'd argue that sharing the parameters is the 'obvious' approach, and the prior methods choose to not tie the parameters to get better accuracy.\n\nThe same holds for being able to handle different noise levels / scale sizes. A single model can always be trained to handle multiple forms of degradation---its just that its likely to do better when it's trained for specific degradation model/level. But more importantly, there is no evidence in the current set of experiments that shows that this is a property of the RIM architecture. (Moreover, this claim goes against one of the motivations of the paper of not training a single prior for different observation models ... but to train the entire inference architecture end-to-end).\n\nIt is possible that the proposed method does offer practical benefits beyond prior work---but these benefits don't come from the idea of simply unrolling iterations, which is not novel. I would strongly recommend that the authors consider a significant re-write of the paper---with a detailed discussion of prior work mentioned in the comments that highlights, with experiments, the specific aspects of their recurrent architecture that enables better recovery for inverse problems. I would also suggest that to claim the mantle of 'solving inverse problems', the paper consider a broader set of inverse tasks---in-painting, deconvolution, different noise models, and possibly working with multiple observations (like for HDR).", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Interesting work", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper presents a method to learn both a model and inference procedure at the same time with recurrent neural networks in the context of inverse problems.\nThe proposed method is interesting and results are quite good.
