      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nSimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has significantly improved over the last few decades, moving from sparse, 2D, slow feature-based maps [23] to dense, 3D, fast maps [16]. For example, KinectFusion [16] impressively estimates a full 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) camera motion while building a dense, metrically accurate 3D map of an environment in real-time [16]. However, most of these compelling developments in SLAM operate under the assumption that the environment is static; i.e., any motion in the environment is considered to be noise. Yet, most environments in our world are dynamic—roadways, hospitals, factories, etc. The ability for robotic systems to deal with such motion is increasingly critical for the advancement of robotic systems used in autonomous driving [14], interaction with articulated objects [3] and tracking [21], among others.\nEarly attempts at extending SLAM to dynamic environments either explicitly track the moving objects [29], remove the moving landmarks [10] from observations, or, alternatively, build two different maps for static and dynamic parts of the environment as Wolf et al. [30] do. However, all of these methods rely strictly on the static parts of the environment to localize the robot. As a consequence, these approaches would fail to extend to environments with significant motion. Fundamentally, neglecting the dynamic part of the environment for robot localization implies that observing the motion provides no information about the location of the robot.\nOn the contrary, we observe that motion has a rich structure that can be leveraged for improving SLAM. We will use the running example of a typical, hinged door throughout this paper. The motion of this door has just a single DOF—the angle about the hinge—rather than the full 6 DOF. Intuitively,\nobserving the relative motion of a door constrains the possible locations of a robot, even though the door itself may be moving. More concretely, explaining away (removing) the motion of a door by explicitly modeling it provides the same constraint for the localization problem as observing a static landmark.\nTo that end, we propose a two-part method for joint articulated motion estimation and SLAM in dynamic environments. Our proposed method first estimates the articulated structure, such as, axis of the motion of a door and its motion parameters, such as, current angle of the door; and, it does so spatiotemporally in an online manner. Essentially, the first step finds the best subspace of the special euclidean manifold (SE(3)) to represent the motion of an object. For our door example, which is a 1 DOF revolute joint, the subspace is a unit circle. All such observed motion in the scene is eventually associated with motion subspace, and each such subspace further constrains the SLAM problem. This first part of our method is inspired by psychophysical experiments on human motion understanding that have demonstrated humans first distinguish between competing articulations (translation, rotation, and expansion) and then estimate the motion conditioned on the motion model [31].\nIn the second part, we build motion-continuity-based temporal prediction models to capture the temporal evolution of the motion parameters in the established subspace. To summarize, the first part finds a 1 DOF subspace of the special euclidean (SE(3)) manifold and the second part models the evolution of an object’s motion in the resulting subspace. The resulting framework allows us to estimate articulated structure along with the motion propagation model and hence, allows us to include articulated motions in an online SLAM framework. Indeed, we show the application of temporal predictions of the resulting model for SLAM in dynamic environments.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that explicitly estimates spatiotemporal articulated motion and integrates it while performing SLAM in a dynamic environment. The proposed method has two major contributions. First, we propose an online articulated structure with an explicit temporal model estimation from a low number of feature tracks. Theoretically, our method can estimate articulated structure of a prismatic or revolute articulated joint using just a single feature track. Second, we show how the spatiotemporal articulated motion prediction can be integrated within\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n03 52\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n2 A\npr 2\n01 6\nSLAM to estimate the motion of the dynamic objects while building a map of an unknown dynamic environment.

      "text" : "Articulation structure estimation methods attempt to recover the linking structure, or kinematic chain, of rigid bodies, essentially discovering the articulated joints that constrain the motion of rigid bodies to a subspace of SE(3). The early approaches to address this problem extended multibody structure from motion [4] ideas to understand articulation by clustering feature trajectories into individual rigid bodies [33]. With the introduction of the commercial depth camera, the feature trajectories could be directly represented in 3D and thus avoiding the need to estimate shape [20, 13]. However, these methods implicitly assume that large number of features trajectories are available whereas our model can estimate the articulation structure of a single trajectory.\nTo avoid the problem of dense feature tracking, some methods achieve direct sensing of articulated motion via placement of markers, such as, ARToolKit [7], checker-board markers etc. [9, 26, 25, 11]. The placement of markers removes the need for an otherwise noisy feature-tracking process from the structure estimation problem. Another way to get better estimation of articulated motion is via active interaction of a robot manipulating an articulated object [12, 11]. In contrast, our method requires no such markers nor active manipulation; in fact, using our method, a robotic system could observe a different agent manipulating the environment to infer its articulation structure.\nThese prior works in estimating articulation structure have mostly relied on collecting data from demonstrations and performing articulation estimation offline, e.g., [26, 25]. In contrast to these state-of-the-art methods, we do online articulation estimation. Online estimation not only enables evolving beliefs with more observations but also allows for inclusion in online tracking and mapping algorithms. The closest work to ours is Martin et al. [15] who propose a framework for online estimation; however, their method has no explicit probabilistic measure for model confidence to select an articulation model. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art in articulation estimation does not model the temporal evolution of motion.\nOur model directly addresses this lack of temporal modeling (for example, acceleration/deceleration of a door) in articulation estimation. We propose an explicit temporal model for each articulation type, which is necessary to make good long-term future predictions. Temporal modeling of arbitrary order allows us to: i) track new parts/objects that enter/exit the scene [15]; ii) model the entire scene and as a result\nexplore dependencies between neighboring objects; and, iii) assimilate articulated object motion in SLAM [5]. Apart from the applications presented in this paper, temporal models associated with articulated structure will help in robot-environment interaction, specifically obtaining dynamic characteristics of the objects in the environment [26]."

      "text" : "Previous literature to handle dynamic environments can be divided into two predominant approaches: i) detect moving objects and ignore them [10], and ii) track moving objects as landmarks [2]. In the first approach, using the fact that the conventional SLAM map is highly redundant, the moving landmarks can be removed from the map building process [1]. In contrast, moving-object tracking-based approaches explicitly track moving objects by adding them to the estimation state [29]. Hahnel et al. [10] propose tracking humans in dense populated environments and removing the areas corresponding to humans to build static maps. Nieuwenhuisen et al. [18] proposed using a parametrized model of a door to localize doors in a moving environment while simultaneously estimating a static map. Recent work has focused on updating the map by removing dynamic parts of the scene without considering the nature of motion in the environment [6]. However, these methods assume that the measurement of moving objects carries no useful information for the robot localization. Furthermore, these method do not strive to build maps of dynamic environments that can be used to discover articulated structure or novel objects. Our method demonstrates the utility of estimating motion and incorporating it into SLAM in both simulated and real-world cases.\nStachniss and Burgard [24] considered a graphic model similar to ours to update the map of a dynamic environment by using local patch maps and modeling transitions between patch maps. However, such an approach is only suitable for quasi-static environments as the number of maps required would increase exponentially with the number and pose characterizations of dynamic objects in the world. A recent work has extended dense tracking and mapping to dynamic scenes by estimating a dense warp field [17]. However, the approach disregards the object level rigid nature which limits its application to topological changes, such as, open to closed door. In the context of manipulating doors, Pretrovskaya et al. [19] used a model of the door and a prior low-resolution static map of environment to track objects for manipulation tasks. In contrast, our approach does not need any prior maps of the environment or articulated objects, and does not suffer from exponential increase in the number of maps for a dynamic environment."

      "text" : "We represent all articulated motion in the environment as\nzt = fM (C, q(t)) + ν (1)\nwhere zt is the observed motion of an object (a trajectory in 3D at time t), M ∈ {Mj}rj=1 is one of the r possible motion models, C is the configuration space (e.g. axis vector in case of a door), q(t) represents the time-varying motion variables (e.g. length of prismatic joint, angle of door) associated with the motion model M and ν is the noise in observations. We assume that all observed motion can be explained by one of the pre-defined r possible motion models. Indeed, there are only finite articulated joint models in man-made environments.\nThis kind of representation, where non-time varying configuration parameters are separated from time-varying motion variables, is beneficial for a variety of reasons: First, it allows for the unified treatment of various types of articulation due to its single and consistent representation of motion variables. Second, this representation can be robustly estimated from experimental data given the reduced number of parameters to be estimated. Furthermore, it often makes the estimation problem linear, and as a consequence, convex.\nA notable omission from our modeling of articulation model, Eq. 1 is the input to the system such as torque acting on a door, force on a drawer etc. This modeling limitation is due to the passive nature of our sensing approach in addition to no prior information about the agents in the scene. To probabilistically predict motion at the next time step P (zt+1|zt) (under Markovian assumption) without modeling the input forces/torques (thus not using a dynamics model), we model the propagation of motion variables P (qt+1|qt).\nThe configuration parameters in Eq. 1 are entirely dependent on the type of articulated joint. In this section, we consider the problem of articulation identification from point correspondences over time. Rigid bodies can move in 3D space with SE(3) configuration, which is the product space of SO(3) (Rotation Group for 3D rotation) and E(3) (Translation using 3D movement). The full SE(3) has 6 DOF, which are reduced when a rigid body is connected to another rigid body via a joint. For example, the configuration space for a revolute joint (1 DOF joint) can be assumed to be a connected subset of the unit circle. Figure 1 shows some of the articulated joints modeled in this work.\nWe model the environment as collection of landmarks which can move according to three different articulation models: static, prismatic and revolute. To find a relevant subspace of SE(3), we fit a circle and line in 3D using least square formulation (optimal for Gaussian noise) to estimate the subspace corresponding to revolute and prismatic joint respectively. For the static joint, we model a perturbation from the previous position as motion variable. We provide more details on the articulated models used in the current paper in Appendix VIII-A."

      "text" : "Articulation estimation provides us with configuration parameters of the articulated motion but one still needs to estimate the evolution of motion variables over time (e.g. position of the object along an axis for a prismatic joint). The goal of our approach is to enforce a structure on the evolution\nof articulated motion without using any prior information specific to the current articulated body. We take our inspiration from neuroscience literature which posits that humans produce smooth trajectories to plan movements from one point to another in environment [8]. This smoothness assumption can be leveraged by using motion models that use limited number of position derivatives.\nLet us assume that q(t) is the articulated motion variable (e.g. extension of a prismatic joint, angle of door along a hinge ). The system model for a finite order motion in discrete time domain with X(t) = [q, q(1), ., ., q(n−1)] (dropping the explicit time dependence of q and using superscript to denote the order of derivative) as the state can be written as,\nX(t+ 1) = AX(t) +Bη\nA =  1 δt δt 2\n2 . . 0 1 δt . . 0 0 1 . . 0 0 1 . . 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 1 B =  δtn n! δtn−1 (n−1)! . . δt2 2! δt  (2)\nwhere q(n) denotes nth order derivative of the motion variable and η is the noise.\nThe model considered in Eq. 2 attempts to predict the motion variable q(t + 1) using the information at time step t. It is a finite order Taylor series expansion of the motion variable q(t + 1). We initialize the state X by obtaining q(t) via inverse kinematics based on Eq. 1 and then evaluating numerical derivatives via Gaussian convolved motion parameter estimates. Our representation assumes the differentiability of the motion variable. The approximation error is of the order O((δt)n). Various convergence studies can be done to choose the right order n for a given time duration δt, but here we study the physical aspects of the problem.\na) Choosing Order: Ideally, one would want to choose the motion variable order as high as possible to reduce the approximation error in Taylor series, especially, for long-term\nbehavior prediction which is necessary for motion planning or when sensors go blind. But, higher order motion models will result in over-fitting because of the need to estimate more parameters from few initial samples. It also increases the filtering problem complexity as Kalman filtering involves matrix multiplication. Hence, the computational complexity is atleast O(N2), where N is the length of the state vector. Furthermore, the error in estimating higher-order derivatives of a noisy signal increases exponentially with respect to derivative order.\nFor the current work, we found the first order motion models to be adequate for most of the experimental use cases."

      "text" : "We now consider the task of estimating the type of articulated model M ∈ {Mj}rj=1 out of r different models. This does not automatically follow from the configuration and motion variables estimation. For example, consider the case of a point particle moving in 3D space: one can fit a line, circle or assume it to be static. One can potentially use goodnessof-fit measures to estimate the appropriate model along with some heuristics. However, there are various limitations in comparing goodness-of-fit measures related to the number of free parameters in different models, noise in the data, overfitting and the number of data samples required [22]. Instead of picking a model at the initial time-step, we use a filteringbased multiple model approach to correctly pick the model for a given object.\nWe assume that our target object/particle obeys one of the r different motion models. In the current formulation, we assume a uniform prior µj(0) = P (Mj), ∑r j=1 µj(0) = 1, over different spatiotemporal articulation models for each individual object. This prior can be modified appropriately by object detection. For example, a door is more likely to have a revolute joint. Motion model probabilities are updated as more and more observations are received using laws of total probability [32].\nµj(t) ≡ P (Mj |Z0:t) = P (zt|Z0:t−1,Mj)P (Mj |Z0:t−1)\nP (zt|Z0:t−1)\nµj(t) = P (zt|Z0:t−1,Mj)µj(t− 1)∑r j=1 P (zt|Z0:t−1,Mj)µj(t− 1)\n(3)\nThe probability of the current observation zt (the entire trajectory of observation up to time t is denoted by Z0:t−1) conditioned over a specific articulated motion model and all the previous observations can be represented by various methods. This probability for an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based filtering algorithm is the probability of observation residual as sampled from a normal distribution distributed with zero mean and innovation covariance [32]. One could pick a model by simply picking the model with maximum probability. However, in a online estimation framework, outliers might change the probability significantly in short term. We pick a model based on probabilistic threshold, which is decided based on the total number of the models r.

Please note that m in lower case is used to refer to the landmark while M is used to refer to the type of motion model.\nBasic SLAM algorithms assume the map mt−1 ≡ mt ≡ m to be static and model the combination of robot state and map ({xt,m}) as the state of the estimation problem [5]. The associated estimation problem only requires a motion model P (xt|xt−1, ut) and an observation model P (zt|xt,m). The observation model assumes the observations to be conditionally independent given the map and the current vehicle state. The goal of the estimation process is to produce unbiased and consistent estimates (the expectation of mean squared errors should match the filter-calculated covariance) [32].\nIn contrast, for the dynamic SLAM problem, the state consists of a time-varying map and the robot state.

      "text" : "We briefly describe the articulated structure and motion parameters of the articulated joints modeled in this paper.\n1) Revolute Joint: For a landmark moving according to revolute motion, the articulation structure consists of the plane of motion P , location of center and radius of the circle in that plane. The motion parameter to characterize the motion is simply the angle φt of the current point with respect to the horizontal. The equation of motion can be written as\nmj = (x0 + r cosφt)v1 + (y0 + r sinφt)v2 + P0, (15)\nwhere mj is the current location of j the landmark. v1, v2 and P0 are two perpendicular vectors in the plane and a point on the plane P respectively. r is the radius of the circle and θ is the angle with respect to horizontal. To estimate the articulated structure, we first fit a plane in 3D and then fit a circle to the projection of points on that plane using least squares.\n2) Prismatic Joint: Articulated structure estimation of a prismatic joint simply involves fitting a line to the landmark positions over time. The equation of motion is given by\nmj = ltn̂, (16)\nwhere lt is the time-varying motion parameter that measures length along a line represented by n̂.\n3) Static Joint: For a static joint, we simply take the position of the static joint P0 as the structure and the motion variables models a perturbation about that location. The equation of motion is given by\nmj = P0 + [1, 1, 1] T lt, (17)\nwhere lt is the perturbation of the landmark at time step t around the static location."

The resulting model can predict future motions of an articulated object with high confidence because of the spatial and temporal structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive model by incorporating it within a standard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipeline for mapping and robot localization in previously unexplored dynamic environments. Our method is able to localize the robot and map a dynamic scene by explaining the observed motion in the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both simulated and real-world dynamic environments.",
