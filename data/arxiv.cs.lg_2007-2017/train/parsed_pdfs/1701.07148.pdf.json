      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown notable results in image recognition: VGG [10] and GoogleNet [11] achieved around 90% accuracy for top-5 classification in ImageNet2012 dataset; AlexNet [7] also achieved around 80% top-5 accuracy with the same dataset.\nOn the other hand, there is an emerging need for embedding or executing CNNs on smart devices such as mobile phones, robots, and embedded devices, in order to give them more intelligence. But the barrier here is that CNNs will require high amounts of memory and computational resources, which are unfortunately hard to be met by small-sized smart devices.\nIn order to tackle this problem, several approaches recently have been proposed based on tensor decomposition, including Tucker decomposition [5] and Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition [2], [8]. Kim et al. [5] successfully decompose all the layers by using Tucker decomposition. However, Tucker decomposition does not seem to compress as much as CP-decomposition due to the core tensors. Moreover, CPdecomposition [2], [8] has not been successful in compressing the whole convolution layers of a CNN because of the CP instability issue [8].\nIn this work, we further investigate low-rank CPdecomposition to compress the whole convolution layers of a CNN. Our method, called CP-TPM, is based on lowrank CP-decomposition with Tensor Power Method (TPM) for efficient optimization. We also propose iterative fine-tuning to overcome the CP-decomposition instability. We expect the followings with our method: • The whole convolution layer decomposition with CP:\nTo the best of our knowledge, the whole convolution layer decomposition has not been successful because of CPdecomposition’s instability [8]. We expect that CP-TPM\ncan decompose the whole convolution layers in contrast to previous CP-decomposition approaches [2], [8]. • Overcoming CP-decomposition instability by iterative fine-tuning: The instability of CP-decomposition, in our view, is the cause of ill-training, such that the loss does not decrease or even amplified when all of the layers are decomposed by CP and fine-tuned once at the final stage. We believe that CP-decomposition on the whole convolution layers without fine-tuning in between causes the loss to be accumulated and become unrecoverable by the once-and-for-all fine-tuning after decomposition. We empirically prove in the experiment that this instability can be overcome by iterative fine-tuning.\nOur CP-TPM achieves much reduction in memory and computational cost without a very small accuracy drop."

If the rank is too high, compression would not be maximized, and if it is too low, the accuracy would drop too much to be recovered by fine-tuning. However, there is no straight algorithm to find the optimal tensor rank [6]. In fact, determining the rank is NP-hard [3].\nThus, we apply a primitive principle in determining the rank: the higher the accuracy loss caused by a layer, the higher rank the layer needs. Rank proportion is the proportion of rank of a layer among other layers. In order to figure out how sensitive a layer is to decomposition, we perform kind of prior decomposition of each layer with a very low, but constant rank (e.g., 5), and then fine-tune the whole network (one epoch)."

We employ Tensor Power Method (TPM) [1]. TPM is known to explain the same variance with less rank compared to ALS [1] because the rank-1 tensors found in the early steps of the process explains most of the variances in the target tensor.\nTPM approximates a target tensorW by adding rank-1 tensors iteratively. First, TPM finds a rank-1 tensor,Wdecomposed, to approximate W by minimizing ||W − Wdecomposed||2 in a coordinate descent manner. The main idea in the decomposition is that it utilizes the residual Wresidual = W − Wdecomposed, so that the next iteration approximates the residual tensor Wresidual by minimizing ||Wresidual − Wdecomposed||2. This continues until the number of rank-1 tensors found is equal to R. More details can be found in [1]."

[8] pointed out, CP decomposition has not yet successfully applied to the whole convolution layers of a CNN with one-time finetuning because of its instability [5], [8].\nTo overcome the instability, we iteratively fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each layer in order to prevent the errors from getting too big to recover. In the iterative fine-tuning, no layer is frozen because freezing some layers makes the approach greedy, which usually tends to stuck in local minima. As experimented in [12], letting the layers unfrozen shows better results compared to freezing. In this way, all the layers including the already decomposed can adjust to the newly decomposed layer."

      "heading" : "B. Whole Network Decomposition",
      "text" : "In this section, we explain the results of decomposing the whole network with CP-TPM and iterative fine tuning. As mentioned before, to the best of our knowledge, CP-based decomposition has not yet been successful to the whole convolution layer decomposition because of its instability causing the network to be ill-trained. To overcome the problem, we apply fine tuning iteratively so that the errors from each decomposition are not amplified, which usually is with normal one-shot fine tuning performed after the whole convolution layer decomposition.\nFig. 2 shows the steps of our method in AlexNet. Decomposition and fine tuning are performed for each layer. This process iterates from Conv1 to FC8 in sequence.\nIn order to decompose a layer, we first need to figure out the rank. It is desirable for a layer to have as low rank as possible assuming the same level of accuracy. That means each layer should have ranks proportional to its sensitivity, which is defined as the ratio of loss/total loss.\nIn order to calculate sensitivity, we first give the same but very small rank (e.g., 5) to all layers and decompose the layers with that rank, which allows us to get the top-5 accuracy loss as in TABLE II. For example, the total loss for Conv layers is 57.99, and each convolutional layers is assigned with a rank proportional to its sensitivity value from a total of 750 ranks. The same method is also applied to the fully connected layers and in this case we use a total of 900 ranks, which is higher than for the convolutional layers because the FC layers will certainly have much more effects on accuracy.\nAs seen in Table I, We achieved a better compression results in both the number of weights and computation cost compared with [5] while maintaining roughly the same level of accuracy. Specifically, we achieved 1.42% accuracy loss which is less than Tucker accuracy loss of 1.62%, with better compression rate. Our method achieved ×6.98 parameter reduction and ×3.53 speeding-up, which is better than Tucker-based method that shows ×5.46 and ×2.67 respectively."

      "heading" : "IV. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We have demonstrated that a TPM-based low-rank CPdecomposition combined with the iterative fine-tuning can achieve a whole network decomposition, which has not been tried before with CP. This approach outperforms the previous Tucker-based decomposition method of Kim et al. [5] for the whole network decomposition. Specifically, our method achieves ×6.98 parameter reduction and ×3.53 speeding-up in\nAlexnet, while Tucker-based method shows ×5.46 and ×2.67 respectively.\nThere remains much work to be further researched. Firstly, there can be many variations in the iterative fine-tuning, for example, freezing layers after fine-tuning and unfreezing in the final fine-tuning; or starting fine-tuning from the last layer. Secondly, this work has focused more on convolution layers than fully connected layers, where we just have applied SVD. Thus, finding the best algorithms for fully connected layers still needs to be tried. Finally and the most importantly, figuring out the ranks in a systematic manner rather than arbitrary will be another key issue in the further research."

However, they need a lot of memory and computational cost, which hinders them from running in relatively low-end smart devices such as smart phones. We propose a CNN compression method based on CP-decomposition and Tensor Power Method. We also propose an iterative fine tuning, with which we fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each layer, but before decomposing the next layer. Significant reduction in memory and computation cost is achieved compared to state-ofthe-art previous work with no more accuracy loss.",
