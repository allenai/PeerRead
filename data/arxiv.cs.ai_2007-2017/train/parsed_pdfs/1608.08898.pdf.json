      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "In recent years, the problem of multi-label classification is gaining much importance motivated by increasing application areas such as text categorization [1-5], marketing, music categorization, emotion, genomics, medical diagnosis [6], image and video categorization, etc. Recent realization of the omnipresence of multi-label prediction tasks in real world problems has drawn increased research attention [7].\nClassification in machine learning is defined as “Given a set of training examples composed of pairs {xi,yi}, find a function f(x) that maps each attribute vector xi to its associated class yi, i = 1,2,….,n, where n is the total number of training samples” [8]. These classification problems are called single-label classification. Single-label classification problems involve mapping each of the input vectors to its unique target class from a pool of target classes. However, there are several classification problems in which the target classes are not mutually exclusive and the input samples belong to more than one target class. These problems cannot be classified using single-label classification thus resulting in the development of several multi-label classifiers to mitigate this limitation. By the recent advancements in technology, the application areas of multi-label classifiers spread across various domains such as text categorization, bioinformatics [9-10], medical diagnosis, scene classification [11-12], map labeling [13],\nmultimedia, biology, music categorization, genomics, emotion, image and video categorization and so on. Several classifiers are developed to address the multi-label problem and are available in the literature. Multi-label problems are more difficult and more complex compared to single-label problems due to its generality [14]. In this paper, we propose a high-speed multi-label classifier based on extreme learning machines (ELM). The proposed ELM-based approach outperforms all existing multi-label classifiers with respect to training time and testing time and other performance metrics.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. A brief overview of different types of multi-label classifiers available in the literature is discussed in Section II. Section III describes the proposed approach for multi-label problems. Different benchmark metrics for multi-label datasets and experimentation specifications are discussed in Section IV. In Section V, a comparative study of the proposed method with existing methods and related discussions are carried out. Finally, concluding remarks are given in Section VI."

      "text" : "The definition for multi-label learning as given by [15] is; “Given a training set, S = (xi, yi), 1 ≤ i ≤ n, consisting of n training instances, (xi ϵ X, yi ϵ Y) drawn from an unknown distribution D, the goal of multi-label learning is to produce a multi-label classifier h:X→Y that optimizes some specific evaluation function or loss function”.\nLet pi be the probability that the input sample is assigned to ith class from a pool of M target classes. For single-label classification such as binary and multi-class classification the following equality condition holds true.\n∑ \uD835\uDC5D\uD835\uDC56 = 1 (1)\nThis equality does not hold for multi-label problems as each sample may have more than one target class. Also, it can be seen that the binary classification problems, the multi-class problems and ordinal regression problems are specific instances of the multi-label problems with the number of labels corresponding to each data sample restricted to 1 [16].\nThe multi-label learning problem can be summarized as follows:\n─ There exists an input space that contains tuples (features or attributes) of size D of\ndifferent data types such as Boolean, discrete or continuous. xi ϵ X, xi = (xi1,xi2,….xiD).\n─ A label space of tuple size M exists which is given as, L = {ζ1, ζ2,…., ζM} . ─ Each data sample is given as a pair of tuples (input space and label space respec-\ntively). {(xi,yi) | xi ϵ X, yi ϵ Y, Y ⊆ L, 1≤i≤N} where N is the number of training samples. ─ A training model that maps the input tuple to the output tuple with high speed, high\naccuracy and less complexity.\nSeveral approaches for solving multi-label problem are available in the literature. Earlier categorization of the multi-label (ML) methods [17] classify the methods into two categories, namely, Problem Transformation (PT) and Algorithm Adaptation (AA)\nmethods. This categorization is extended to include a third category of methods by Gjorgji Madjarov et al [18] called Ensemble methods (EN). Several review articles are available in the literature that describe various methods available for multi-label classification [7,8,15,17,18]. As adapted from [18], an overview of multi-label methods available in the literature is given in Fig. 1.\nBased on the machine learning algorithm used, the multi-label techniques can be categorized as shown in Fig. 2, adapted from [18]. This paper proposes a high speed multi-label learning technique based on ELM, which outperforms all the existing techniques based on speed and performance."

      "heading" : "3 Proposed Approach",
      "text" : "The extreme learning machine is a learning technique that operates on a single-layer feedforward neural network. The key advantage of the ELM over the traditional backpropagation (BP) neural network is that it has the smallest number of parameters to be adjusted and it can be trained with very high speed. The traditional BP network needs to be initialized and several parameters tuned and improper selection of which can result in local optima. On the other hand, in ELM, the initial weights and the hidden layer bias can be selected at random and the network can be trained for the output weights in order to perform the classification [19-22]. The key steps in extending the ELM to multi-label problems is in the pre-processing and post-processing of data. In multi-label problems, each input sample may belong to one or more samples. The number of labels an input sample belongs to is not previously known. Therefore, both the number of labels and the target labels are to be identified for the test input samples and also the\ndegree of multi-labelness varies among different datasets. This results in increased complexity of the multi-label problem resulting in much longer training and testing time of the multi-label classification technique. The proposed algorithm exploits the inherent high speed nature of the ELM resulting in both high speed and superior performance compared with the existing multi-label classification techniques.\nConsider N training samples of the form {(xi,yi)} where xi in the input denoted as xi = [xi1,xi2,…,xin]T ϵ Rn and yi is the target label set, yi = [yi1,yi2,…yim]T. As opposed to traditional single-label case, the target label is not a single label but is a subset of labels from the label space given as Y⊆L, L = {ζ1, ζ2,…., ζM}. Let \uD835\uDC41 be the number of hidden layer neurons, the output ‘o’ of the SLFN is given by\n∑ \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC57) = ∑ \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54(\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56 . \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC57 + \uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC57\n\uD835\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n\uD835̅\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n(2)\nwhere, βi = [βi1,βi2,…βim]T is the output weight, g(x) is the activation function, wi =\n[wi1,wi2,…win]T is the input weight and bi is the hidden layer bias.\nFor the ELM, the input weights wi and the hidden layer bias bi are randomly assigned. Therefore, the network must be trained for βi such that the output of the network is equal to the target class so that the error difference between the actual output and the predicted output is 0.\n∑‖\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC57 − \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC57‖\n\uD835\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC57=1\n= 0 (3)\nThus, the ELM classifier output can be as follows:\n∑ \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54(\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56 . \uD835\uDC65\uD835\uDC57 + \uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC56) = \uD835\uDC66\uD835\uDC57\n\uD835\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n(4)\nThe above equation can be written in following matrix form:\nHβ = Y (5)\nThe output weights of the ELM network can be estimated using the equation\nβ = H+Y (6a)\nwhere H+ is the Moore-Penrose inverse of the hidden layer output matrix H and it\ncan be calculated as follows:\nH+ = (HTH)-1HT (6b)\nThe theory and mathematics behind the ELM have been extensively discussed in [23-25] and hence are not re-stated here. The steps involved in multi-label ELM classifier are given below.\nInitialization of Parameters. Fundamental parameters such as the number of hidden layer neurons and the activation function are initialized.\nProcessing of Inputs. In the multi-label case, each input sample can be associated with more than one class labels. Hence, each of the input samples will have the associated output label as a m-tuple with 0 or 1 representing the belongingness to each of the labels in the label space L. The label set denoting the belongingness for each of the labels is converted from unipolar representation to bipolar representation.\nELM Training. The processed input is then supplied to the basic batch learning ELM. Let H be the hidden layer output matrix, β be the output weights and Y be the target label, the ELM can be represented in a compact form as Hβ = Y where Y⊆L, L = {ζ1, ζ2,…., ζM}. In the training phase, the input weights and the hidden layer bias are randomly assigned and the output weights β are estimated as β = H+Y, where H+ = (HT H)1HT gives the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix.\nELM Testing. In the testing phase, the test data sample is evaluated using the values of β obtained during the training phase. The network then predicts the target output using the equation Y = Hβ. The predicted output Y obtained is a set of real numbers of dimension equal to the number of labels.\nPost-processing and Multi-label Identification. The key challenge in multi-label classification is that the input sample may belong to one or more than one of the target labels. The number of labels that the sample corresponds to is completely unknown. Hence, a thresholding-based label association is proposed. The L dimensioned rawpredicted output is compared with a threshold value. The index values of the predicted output Y which are greater than the threshold fixed represents the belongingness of the input sample to the corresponding class.\nSetting the threshold value is of critical importance. Threshold setting has to be made in such a way that it maximizes the difference between the values of the label the data belongs to and the labels the data does not. The distribution of the raw output values is categorized into a range of values that represent the belongingness of the label and the range of values that represent the non-belongingness of the label to a particular sample. From the distribution, a particular value is chosen that maximizes the separation between the two categories of the labels. It is to be highlighted that there are no ELMbased multi-label classifier in the literature thus far. The proposed method is the first to adapt the ELM for multi-label problems and make extensive experimentation and results comparison and analysis with the state-of-the-arts multi-label classification techniques."

      "text" : "This section describes the different multi-label dataset metrics and gives the experimental design used to evaluate the proposed method. Multi-label datasets have a unique property called the degree of multi-labelness. The number of labels, the number of samples having multiple labels, the average number of labels corresponding to a particular sample varies among different datasets. Two dataset metrics are available in the literature to quantitatively measure the multi-labelness of a dataset. They are Label Cardinality (LC) and Label Density (LD). Consider there are N training samples and the dataset is of the form {(xi,yi)} where xi in the input data and yi is the target label set. The target label set is a subset of labels from the label space with M elements given as Y⊆L, L = {ζ1, ζ2… ζM}.\nDefinition 4.1 [17] Label Cardinality of the dataset is the average number of labels\nof the examples in the dataset.\n\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 − \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC66 =\n1 \uD835\uDC41 ∑|\uD835\uDC4C\uD835\uDC56|\n\uD835\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n(7)\nLabel Cardinality signifies the average number of labels present in the dataset. Definition 4.2 [17] Label Density of the dataset is the average number of labels of\nthe examples in the dataset divided by |L|.\n\uD835\uDC3F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 − \uD835\uDC37\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC66 =\n1 \uD835\uDC41 ∑ |\uD835\uDC4C\uD835\uDC56| |\uD835\uDC3F|\n\uD835\uDC41\n\uD835\uDC56=1\n(8)\nLabel density takes into consideration the number of labels present in the dataset. The properties of two datasets have same label cardinality, but different label density can vary significantly and may result in different behavior of the training algorithm [14]. The influence of label density and label cardinality on multi-label learning is analyzed by Flavia et al in 2013 [26]. The proposed method is experimented with six benchmark datasets comprising of different application areas and its results are compared with 9 existing state-of-the-art methods. The datasets are chosen in such a way that they exhibit diverse nature of characteristics and the wide range of label density and label cardinality. The datasets are obtained from KEEL multi-label dataset repository and the specifications of the dataset are given in Table 1. The details of state-ofthe-arts multi-label techniques used for result comparison are given in Table 2."

Being an ELM based algorithm, since the initial weights are assigned in random, it is critical to evaluate the consistency of the proposed technique. The unique feature of multi-label classification is the possibility of partial correctness of the classifier, i.e. one or more of the multiple labels to which the sample instance belongs and/or the number of labels the sample instance belongs can be identified partially correctly. Therefore, calculating the error rate for multi-label problems is not same as that of traditional binary or multiclass problems. In order to quantitatively measure the correctness of the classifier, the hamming loss performance metric is used. To evaluate the consistency of the proposed method, a 5 fold and a 10 fold cross validation of hamming loss metric is evaluated for each of the six datasets and is tabulated.\nTable 3. Consistency table – cross validation\nDataset Hamming Loss - 5-fcv Hamming Loss - 10-fcv\nEmotion 0.2492(±0.0058) 0.2509(±0.0050)\nYeast 0.1906(±0.0025) 0.1911(±0.0031) Scene 0.0854(±0.0029) 0.0851(±0.0033) Corel5k 0.0086(±0.0005) 0.0090(±0.0006)\nEnron 0.0474(±0.0022) 0.0472(±0.0015) Medical 0.0108(±0.0008) 0.0109(±0.0009)\nFrom the table 3, it can be seen that the proposed technique is consistent in its performance over repeated executions and cross validations thus demonstrating the consistency of the technique."

Also, the F1-measure of the proposed approach outperforms the most recent method which uses canonical correlation analysis (CCA) with ELM for multi-label\nproblems [27] in most cases. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it surpasses all existing state-of-the-arts methods in terms of speed and simultaneously while remaining one of the top learning techniques in terms of other 5 performance metrics."

Multi-label classification is a superset of traditional binary and multiclass classification problems. The proposed work extends the extreme learning machine technique to adapt to the multi-label problems. As opposed to the singlelabel problem, both the number of labels the sample belongs to, and each of those target labels are to be identified for multi-label classification resulting in increased complexity. The proposed high speed multi-label classifier is applied to six benchmark datasets comprising of different application areas such as multimedia, text and biology. The training time and testing time of the classifier are compared with those of the state-of-the-arts methods. Experimental studies show that for all the six datasets, our proposed technique have faster execution speed and better performance, thereby outperforming all the existing multi-label classification methods.",
