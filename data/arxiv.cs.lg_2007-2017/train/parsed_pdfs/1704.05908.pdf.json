      "text" : "Knowledge bases (KB), such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) and DBpedia (Lehmann et al., 2015), are useful resources for many applications such as question answering (Berant et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2016) and information extraction (Mintz et al., 2009). However, knowledge bases suffer from incompleteness despite their formidable sizes (Socher et al., 2013; West et al., 2014), leading to a number of studies on automatic knowledge base completion (KBC) (Nickel et al., 2015) or link prediction.\nThe fundamental motivation behind these studies is that there exist some statistical regularities under the intertwined facts stored in the multirelational knowledge base. By discovering gener-\nalizable regularities in known facts, missing ones may be recovered in a faithful way. Due to its excellent generalization capability, distributed representations, a.k.a. embeddings, have been popularized to address the KBC task (Nickel et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2011, 2014, 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Guu et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016b).\nAs a seminal work, Bordes et al. (2013) proposes the TransE, which models the statistical regularities with linear translations between entity embeddings operated by a relation embedding. Implicitly, TransE assumes both entity embeddings and relation embeddings dwell in the same vector space, posing an unnecessarily strong prior. To relax this requirement, a variety of models first project the entity embeddings to a relationdependent space (Bordes et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015b; Nguyen et al., 2016b), and then model the translation property in the projected space. Typically, these relation-dependent spaces are characterized by the projection matrices unique to each relation. As a benefit, different aspects of the same entity can be temporarily emphasized or depressed as an effect of the projection. For instance, STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016b) utilizes two projection matrices per relation, one for the head entity and the other for the tail entity.\nDespite the superior performance of STransE compared to TransE, it is more prone to the data sparsity problem. Concretely, since the projection spaces are unique to each relation, projection matrices associated with rare relations can only be exposed to very few facts during training, resulting in poor generalization. For common relations, a similar issue exists. Without any restrictions on the number of projection matrices, logically related or conceptually similar relations may have distinct projection spaces, hindering the discovery, sharing, and generalization of statistical regularities.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n05 90\n8v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nPreviously, a line of research makes use of external information such as textual relations from web-scale corpus or node features (Toutanova et al., 2015; Toutanova and Chen, 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016a), alleviating the sparsity problem. In parallel, recent work has proposed to model regularities beyond local facts by considering multirelation paths (Garcı́a-Durán et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015a; Shen et al., 2016). Since the number of paths grows exponentially with its length, as a side effect, path-based models enjoy much more training cases, suffering less from the problem.\nIn this paper, we propose an interpretable knowledge transfer model (ITransF), which encourages the sharing of statistic regularities between the projection matrices of relations and alleviates the data sparsity problem. At the core of ITransF is a sparse attention mechanism, which learns to compose shared concept matrices into relation-specific projection matrices, leading to a better generalization property. Without any external resources, ITransF improves mean rank and Hits@10 on two benchmark datasets, over all previous approaches of the same kind. In addition, the parameter sharing is clearly indicated by the learned sparse attention vectors, enabling us to interpret how knowledge transfer is carried out. To induce the desired sparsity during optimization, we further introduce a block iterative optimization algorithm.\nIn summary, the contributions of this work are: (i) proposing a novel knowledge embedding model which enables knowledge transfer by learning to discover shared regularities; (ii) introducing a learning algorithm to directly optimize a sparse representation from which the knowledge transferring procedure is interpretable; (iii) showing the effectiveness of our model by outperforming baselines on two benchmark datasets for knowledge base completion task."

      "text" : "Let E denote the set of entities and R denote the set of relations. In knowledge base completion, given a training set P of triples (h, r, t) where h, t ∈ E are the head and tail entities having a relation r ∈ R, e.g., (Steve Jobs, FounderOf, Apple), we want to predict missing facts such as (Steve Jobs, Profession, Businessperson).\nMost of the embedding models for knowledge base completion define an energy function fr(h, t)\naccording to the fact’s plausibility (Bordes et al., 2011, 2014, 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Guu et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016b). The models are learned to minimize energy fr(h, t) of a plausible triple (h, r, t) and to maximize energy fr(h′, t′) of an implausible triple (h′, r, t′).\nMotivated by the linear translation phenomenon observed in well trained word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013), TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) represents the head entity h, the relation r and the tail entity t with vectors h, r and t ∈ Rn respectively, which were trained so that h+r ≈ t. They define the energy function as\nfr(h, t) = ‖h+ r− t‖`\nwhere ` = 1 or 2, which means either the `1 or the `2 norm of the vector h + r − t will be used depending on the performance on the validation set.\nTo better model relation-specific aspects of the same entity, TransR (Lin et al., 2015b) uses projection matrices and projects the head entity and the tail entity to a relation-dependent space. STransE (Nguyen et al., 2016b) extends TransR by employing different matrices for mapping the head and the tail entity. The energy function is\nfr(h, t) = ‖Wr,1h+ r−Wr,2t‖`\nHowever, not all relations have abundant data to estimate the relation specific matrices as most of the training samples are associated with only a few relations, leading to the data sparsity problem for rare relations."

      "text" : "As discussed above, a fundamental weakness in TransR and STransE is that they equip each relation with a set of unique projection matrices, which not only introduces more parameters but also hinders knowledge sharing. Intuitively, many relations share some concepts with each other, although they are stored as independent symbols in KB. For example, the relation “(somebody) won award for (some work)” and “(somebody) was nominated for (some work)” both describe a person’s high-quality work which wins an award or a nomination respectively. This phenomenon suggests that one relation actually represents a collection of real-world concepts, and one concept\ncan be shared by several relations. Inspired by the existence of such lower-level concepts, instead of defining a unique set of projection matrices for every relation, we can alternatively define a small set of concept projection matrices and then compose them into customized projection matrices. Effectively, the relation-dependent translation space is then reduced to the smaller concept spaces.\nHowever, in general, we do not have prior knowledge about what concepts exist out there and how they are composed to form relations. Therefore, in ITransF, we propose to learn this information simultaneously from data, together with all knowledge embeddings. Following this idea, we first present the model details, then discuss the optimization techniques for training.\nEnergy function Specifically, we stack all the concept projection matrices to a 3-dimensional tensor D ∈ Rm×n×n, wherem is the pre-specified number of concept projection matrices and n is the dimensionality of entity embeddings and relation embeddings. We let each relation select the most useful projection matrices from the tensor, where the selection is represented by an attention vector. The energy function of ITransF is defined as:\nfr(h, t) = ‖αHr ·D · h+ r−αTr ·D · t‖` (1)\nwhere αHr ,α T r ∈ [0, 1]m, satisfying ∑ iα H r,i =∑\niα T r,i = 1, are normalized attention vectors used to compose all concept projection matrices in D by a convex combination. It is obvious that STransE can be expressed as a special case of our model when we use m = 2|R| concept matrices and set attention vectors to disjoint one-hot vectors. Hence our model space is a generalization of STransE. Note that we can safely use fewer concept matrices in ITransF and obtain better performance (see section 4.3), though STransE always requires 2|R| projection matrices.\nWe follow previous work to minimize the following hinge loss function:\nL = ∑\n(h,r,t)∼P, (h′,r,t′)∼N\n[ γ + fr(h, t)− fr(h′, t′) ] + (2)\nwhere P is the training set consisting of correct triples, N is the distribution of corrupted triples defined in section 3.3, and [·]+ = max(·, 0). Note that we have omitted the dependence of N on (h, r, t) to avoid clutter. We normalize the entity vectors h, t, and the projected entity vectors\nαHr ·D · h and αTr ·D · t to have unit length after each update, which is an effective regularization method that benefits all models.\nSparse attention vectors In Eq. (1), we have defined αHr ,α T r to be some normalized vectors used for composition. With a dense attention vector, it is computationally expensive to perform the convex combination of m matrices in each iteration. Moreover, a relation usually does not consist of all existing concepts in practice. Furthermore, when the attention vectors are sparse, it is often easier to interpret their behaviors and understand how concepts are shared by different relations.\nMotivated by these potential benefits, we further hope to learn sparse attention vectors in ITransF. However, directly posing `1 regularization (Tibshirani, 1996) on the attention vectors fails to produce sparse representations in our preliminary experiment, which motivates us to enforce `0 constraints on αTr ,α H r .\nIn order to satisfy both the normalization condition and the `0 constraints, we reparameterize the attention vectors in the following way:\nαHr = SparseSoftmax(v H r , I H r ) αTr = SparseSoftmax(v T r , I T r )\nwhere vHr ,v T r ∈ Rm are the pre-softmax scores, IHr , I T r ∈ {0, 1}m are the sparse assignment vectors, indicating the non-zero entries of attention vectors, and the SparseSoftmax is defined as\nSparseSoftmax(v, I)i = exp(vi/τ)Ii∑ j exp(vj/τ)Ij\nwith τ being the temperature of Softmax. With this reparameterization, vHr ,v T r and IHr , I T r replace α T r ,α H r to become the real parameters of the model. Also, note that it is equivalent to pose the `0 constraints on IHr , I T r instead of αTr ,α H r . Putting these modifications together, we can rewrite the optimization problem as\nminimize L subject to ‖IHr ‖0 ≤ k, ‖ITr ‖0 ≤ k\n(3)\nwhere L is the loss function defined in Eq. (2)."

      "text" : "Though sparseness is favorable in practice, it is generally NP-hard to find the optimal solution under `0 constraints. Thus, we resort to an approximated algorithm in this work.\nFor convenience, we refer to the parameters with and without the sparse constraints as the sparse partition and the dense partition, respectively. Based on this notion, the high-level idea of the approximated algorithm is to iteratively optimize one of the two partitions while holding the other one fixed. Since all parameters in the dense partition, including the embeddings, the projection matrices, and the pre-softmax scores, are fully differentiable with the sparse partition fixed, we can simply utilize SGD to optimize the dense partition. Then, the core difficulty lies in the step of optimizing the sparse partition (i.e. the sparse assignment vectors), during which we want the following two properties to hold\n1. the sparsity required by the `0 constaint is maintained, and\n2. the cost define by Eq. (2) is decreased.\nSatisfying the two criterion seems to highly resemble the original problem defined in Eq. (3). However, the dramatic difference here is that with parameters in the dense partition regarded as constant, the cost function is decoupled w.r.t. each relation r. In other words, the optimal choice of IHr , I T r is independent of I H r′ , I T r′ for any r\n′ 6= r. Therefore, we only need to consider the optimization for a single relation r, which is essentially an assignment problem. Note that, however, IHr and ITr are still coupled, without which we basically reach the situation in a backpack problem. In principle, one can explore combinatorial optimization techniques to optimize IHr′ , I T r′ jointly, which usually involve some iterative procedure. To avoid adding another inner loop to our algorithm, we turn to a simple but fast approximation method based on the following single-matrix cost.\nSpecifically, for each relation r, we consider the induced cost LHr,i where only a single projection matrix i is used for the head entity:\nLHr,i = ∑\n(h,r,t)∼Pr, (h′,r,t′)∼Nr\n[ γ + fHr,i(h, t)− fHr,i(h′, t′) ] +\nwhere fHr,i(h, t) = ‖Di · h + r − αTr · D · t‖ is the corresponding energy function, and the subscript in Pr and Nr denotes the subsets with relation r. Intuitively, LHr,i measures, given the current tail attention vector αTr , if only one project matrix could be chosen for the head entity, how implausible Di would be. Hence, i∗ = argmini LHr,i gives\nus the best single projection matrix on the head side given αTr .\nNow, in order to choose the best k matrices, we basically ignore the interaction among projection matrices, and update IHr in the following way:\nIHr,i ← { 1, i ∈ argpartitioni(LHr,i, k) 0, otherwise\nwhere the function argpartitioni(xi, k) produces the index set of the lowest-k values of xi.\nAnalogously, we can define the single-matrix cost LTr,i and the energy function fTr,i(h, t) on the tail side in a symmetric way. Then, the update rule for IHr follows the same derivation. Admittedly, the approximation described here is relatively crude. But as we will show in section 4, the proposed algorithm yields good performance empirically. We leave the further improvement of the optimization method as future work."

      "text" : "Recall that we need to sample a negative triple (h′, r, t′) to compute hinge loss shown in Eq. 2, given a positive triple (h, r, t) ∈ P . The distribution of negative triple is denoted by N(h, r, t). Previous work (Bordes et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2015b; Yang et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2016b) generally constructs a set of corrupted triples by replacing the head entity or tail entity with a random entity uniformly sampled from the KB.\nHowever, uniformly sampling corrupted entities may not be optimal. Often, the head and tail entities associated a relation can only belong to a specific domain. When the corrupted entity comes from other domains, it is very easy for the model to induce a large energy gap between true triple and corrupted one. As the energy gap exceeds γ, there will be no training signal from this corrupted triple. In comparison, if the corrupted entity comes from the same domain, the task becomes harder for the model, leading to more consistent training signal.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose to sample corrupted head or tail from entities in the same domain with a probability pr and from the whole entity set with probability 1 − pr. The choice of relation-dependent probability pr is specified in Appendix A.1. In the rest of the paper, we refer to the new proposed sampling method as ”domain sampling”."

We follow Bordes et al. (2013) to report the filter results, i.e., removing all other correct candidates h′ in ranking.

      "text" : "The overall link prediction results1 are reported in Table 2. Our model consistently outperforms previous models without external information on both the metrics of WN18 and FB15k. On WN18, we even achieve a much better mean rank with comparable Hits@10 than current state-of-the-art model IRN employing external information.\nWe can see that path information is very helpful on FB15k and models taking advantage of path information outperform intrinsic models by a significant margin. Indeed, a lot of facts are easier to recover with the help of multi-step inference. For example, if we know Barack Obama is born in Honolulu, a city in the United States, then we easily know the nationality of Obama is the United States. An straightforward way of extending our proposed model to k-step path P = {ri}ki=1 is to define a path energy function ‖αHP · D · h +∑\nri∈P ri − α T P · D · t‖`, αHP is a concept association related to the path. We plan to extend our model to multi-step path in the future.\nTo provide a detailed understanding why the proposed model achieves better performance, we present some further analysis in the sequel.\nPerformance on Rare Relations In the proposed ITransF, we design an attention mechanism to encourage knowledge sharing across different relations. Naturally, facts associated with rare relations should benefit most from such sharing, boosting the overall performance. To verify this hypothesis, we investigate our model’s performance on relations with different frequency.\nThe overall distribution of relation frequencies resembles that of word frequencies, subject to the zipf’s law. Since the frequencies of relations approximately follow a power distribution, their log\n1Note that although IRN (Shen et al., 2016) does not explicitly exploit path information, it performs multi-step inference through the multiple usages of external memory. When IRN is allowed to access memory once for each prediction, its Hits@10 is 80.7, similar to models without path information.\nfrequencies are linear. The statistics of relations on FB15k and WN18 are shown in Figure 1. We can clearly see that the distributions exhibit long tails, just like the Zipf’s law for word frequency.\nIn order to study the performance of relations with different frequencies, we sort all relations by their frequency in the training set, and split them into 3 buckets evenly so that each bucket has a similar interval length of log frequency.\nWithin each bucket, we compare our model with STransE, as shown in Figure 2.2 As we can see, on WN18, ITransF outperforms STransE by a significant margin on rare relations. In particular, in the last bin (rarest relations), the average Hits@10 increases from 74.4 to 92.0, showing the great benefits of transferring statistical strength from common relations to rare ones. The comparison on each relation is shown in Appendix A.2 where we can observe tha. On FB15k, we can also observe a similar pattern, although the degree of improvement is less significant. We conjecture the difference roots in the fact that many rare relations on FB15k have disjoint domains, knowledge transfer through common concepts is harder.\nInterpretability In addition to the quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of knowledge sharing, we provide some intuitive examples to show how knowledge is shared in our model. As\n2Domain sampling is not employed.\nwe mentioned earlier, the sparse attention vectors fully capture the association between relations and concepts and hence the knowledge transfer among relations. Thus, we visualize the attention vectors for several relations on both WN18 and FB15K in Figure 3.\nFor WN18, the words “hyponym” and “hypernym” refer to words with more specific or general meaning respectively. For example, PhD is a hyponym of student and student is a hypernym of PhD. As we can see, concepts associated with the head entities in one relation are also associated with the tail entities in its reverse relation. Further, “instance hypernym” is a special hypernym with the head entity being an instance, and the tail entity being an abstract notion. A typical example is (New York,instance hypernym, city). This connection has also been discovered by our model, indicated by the fact that “instance hypernym(T)” and “hypernym(T)” share a common concept matrix. Finally, for symmetric relations like “similar to”, we see the head attention is identical to the tail attention, which well matches our intuition.\nOn FB15k, we also see the sharing between reverse relations, as in “(somebody) won award for (some work)” and “(some work) award winning work (somebody)”. What’s more, although relation “won award for” and “was nominated for” share the same concepts,\ntheir attention distributions are different, suggesting distinct emphasis. Finally, symmetric relations like spouse behave similarly as mentioned before.\nModel Compression A byproduct of parameter sharing mechanism employed by ITransF is a much more compact model with equal performance. Figure 5 plots the average performance of ITransF against the number of projection matrices m, together with two baseline models. On FB15k, when we reduce the number of matrices from 2200 to 30 (∼ 90× compression), our model performance decreases by only 0.09% on Hits@10, still outperforming STransE. Similarly, on WN18, ITransF continues to achieve the best performance when we reduce the number of concept project matrices to 18."

      "text" : "A.1 Domain Sampling Probability In this section, we define the probability pr to generate a negative sample from the same domain mentioned in Section 3.3. The probability cannot be too high to avoid generating negative samples that are actually correct, since there are generally a lot of facts missing in KBs.\nSpecifically, let MHr = {h | ∃t(h, r, t) ∈ P} and MTr = {t | ∃h(h, r, t) ∈ P} denote the head or tail domain of relation r. Suppose Nr = {(h, r, t) ∈ P} is the induced set of edges with relation r. We define the probability pr as\npr = min( λ|MTr ||MHr | |Nr| , 0.5) (4)\nOur motivation of such a formulation is as follows: Suppose Or is the set that contains all truthful fact triples on relation r, i.e., all triples in training set and all other missing correct triples. If we assume all fact triples within the domain has uniform probability of being true, the probability of a random triple being correct is Pr((h, r, t) ∈ Or | h ∈ MHr , t ∈ MTr ) =\n|Or| |MHr ||MTr |\nAssume that all facts are missing with a probability λ, then |Nr| = λ|Or| and the above probability can be approximated by |Nr|\nλ|MHr ||MTr | .

The results in section 4 are obtained with λ set to 0.001.\nWe compare how different value of λ would influence our model’s performance in Table. 5. With large λ and higher domain sampling probability, our model’s Hits@10 increases while mean rank also increases. The rise of mean rank is due to higher probability of generating a valid triple as a negative sample causing the energy of a valid triple to increase, which leads to a higher overall rank of a correct entity. However, the reasoning capability is boosted with higher Hits@10 as shown in the table.\nA.2 Performance on individual relations of WN18\nWe plot the performance of ITransF and STransE on each relation. We see that the improvement is greater on rare relations."
