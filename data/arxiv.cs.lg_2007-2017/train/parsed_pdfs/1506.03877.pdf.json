      "text" : "Training good generative models and fitting them to complex and high dimensional training data with probability mass in multiple disjunct locations remains a major challenge. This is especially true for models with multiple layers of deterministic or stochastic variables, which is unfortunate because it has been argued previously [1, 2] that deeper generative models have the potential to capture higher-level abstractions and thus generalize better. With the Helmholtz machine [3, 4], a concept was introduced that proposed to not only fit a powerful but intractable generative model p(x,h) to the training data, but also to jointly train an approximate inference model q(h|x). The q model would be used to efficiently perform approximate inference over the latent variables h of the generative model given an observed example x. This basic idea has been applied and enhanced many times; initially with the wake-sleep algorithm (WS, [3, 5]) and more recently with the variational autoencoder (VAE, [6]), stochastic backpropagation and approximate inference in deep generative models [7], neural variational inference and learning (NVIL, [8]) and reweighted wake-sleep (RWS, [9]). Most of these approaches rely on the variational bound to perform appropriate inference and to obtain an objective function that contains the parameters of both the generative model p and the approximate inference model q in one joint expression (e.g. WS, VAE and NVIL). Not directly\n∗Jörg Bornschein is a CIFAR Global Scholar; Yoshua Bengio is a CIFAR Senior Fellow\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n03 87\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n2 Ju\nn 20\nrelated to the Helmholtz machine, but similar in spirit is the approach described in [10]. It also relies on a bottom-up distribution q(h|x) to perform approximate inference for the latent variables in a very deep generative model p(x,h). But the inference distribution q is fixed and only the parameters of p are learned.\nIn contrast to these previous approaches we here propose to interpret both p and q as approximate inference models for our actual generative model p∗(x,h). We define the target distribution p∗ to be the geometric mean over the top-down and bottom-up approximate inference models, i.e. p∗(x,h) = 1/Z √ p(x,h)q(x,h), which gives rise to the name geometric mean matching (GMM) . The motivation behind this definition is to ensure that the intractable generative model p∗ stays close to the approximate inference models we have at our disposal.\nIn Section 2 we will introduce the GMM model in detail and discuss important theoretical properties and in Section 3 we will explain how to perform importance sampling based training and inference. The ability to model complex distributions is demonstrated empirically in Section 4."

      "text" : "We introduce the concept by defining a joint probability distribution over three variables, an observed vector x and two latent variable vectors h1 and h2. Analogous to a Deep Boltzmann Machine [11] we think of these as layers in a neural network with links between x and h1 on the one side, and h1 and h2 on the other side. We will present the approach in the specific case of an architecture with two hidden layers, but it can be applied to arbitrary graphs of variables without loops. It can especially be used to train architectures with more than two stacked layers of latent variables.\nLet p∗(x,h1,h2) be a joint probability distribution constructed in a specific way from two constituent distributions p(x,h1,h2) and q(x,h1,h2),\np∗(x,h1,h2) = 1\nZ\n√ p(x,h1,h2) q(x,h1,h2) , (1)\nwhere Z is a normalization constant and p and q are directed graphical models from h2 to x and vice versa. In other words p and q can be factorized as\np(x,h1,h2) = p(h2) p(h1|h2) p(x|h1) and q(x,h1,h2) = q(x) q(h1|x) q(h2|h1) . (2)\nWe assume that the prior distribution p(h2) and all conditional distributions belong to some parametrized families of distributions which can be evaluated and sampled from efficiently. For q(x) we do not assume an explicit form, but define it to be the marginal\nq(x) = p∗(x) = ∑ h1,h2 p∗(x,h1,h2) (3)\n=\n√ q(x)\nZ ∑ h1,h2 √ p(x,h1,h2) q(h1|x)q(h2|h1) (4)\n=  1 Z ∑ h1,h2 √ p(x,h1,h2) q(h1|x)q(h2|h1) 2 . (5) The normalization constant Z guarantees that ∫ x,h1,h2 p∗(x,h1,h2) = 1. Using the Cauchy-\nSchwarz inequality ∣∣∫ f(y)g(y)dy ∣∣2 ≤ ∫ |f(y)|2 dy ∫ |g(y′)|2 dy′ and identifying √p(y) with\nf(y) and √ q(y) with g(y), it becomes clear that Z = ∫ x √ p(y)q(y) dy ≤ 1 for arbitrary p and q. Furthermore, we see that Z = 1 only when p(x,h1,h2) = q(x,h1,h2). We can therefore obtain a lower bound on the marginal probability p∗(x):\np̃∗(x) = ∑ h1,h2 √ p(x,h1,h2)q(h1|x) q(h2|h1) 2 = Z2 p∗(x) ≤ p∗(x) . (6)\nThis suggests that the model distribution p∗(x) can be fitted to some training data by maximizing the bound of the log-likelihood p̃∗(x) instead of p∗(x), as we elaborate in the following section.\nSince log p̃∗(x) can reach the maximum only when Z → 1, the model is implicitly pressured to find a maximum likelihood solution that yields p(x,h1,h2) ≈ q(x,h1,h2) ≈ p∗(x,h1,h2)."

      "text" : "Let us consider the case where we would actually maximize log p∗(x) instead of the lower bound log p̃∗(x). We can then decompose the objective using the Bhattacharyya distance DB(p, q) = − log ∑ y √ p(y)q(y) into two terms:\nlog p∗(x) = 2 log ∑ h1,h2 √ p(x,h1,h2)q(h1|x)q(h2|h1)\n− 2 log ∑\nx′,h′1,h ′ 2\n√ p(x′,h′1,h ′ 2)q(x ′,h′1,h ′ 2)\n= log p̃∗(x)− 2 logZ = log p̃∗(x) + 2DB(p, q) (7) with DB(p, q) ≥ 0 for arbitrary p, q and DB(p, q) = 0 only when p = q.\nWe can compare this to the variational approach, where the marginal probability log p(y) of some model containing latent variables z is rewritten in terms of the KL-divergence DKL(q || p) =∑ z q(z|y) log q(z|y) p(z|y) ≥ 0 to obtain a lower bound:\nlog p(y) = E z∼q(z|y) [log p(y, z)− log q(z|y)] +DKL(q(z|y) || p(z|x))\n≥ E z∼q(z|y) [log p(y, z)− log q(z|y)] . (8)\nAnalogous to variational methods that maximize the lower bound (8), we can thus maximize log p̃∗(x) and it will tighten the bound as DB(p, q) approaches zero. While this seems very similar to the variational lower bound, we should highlight that there are some important conceptual differences: 1) The KL-divergence in variational methods typically measures the distance between distributions given some training data. The Bhattacharyya distance here in contrast quantifies a property of the model p∗(x,h1,h2) independently of any training data. In fact, we saw that DB(p, q) = − logZ. 2) The variational lower bound is typically used to construct approximate inference algorithms. We here use our bound p̃∗(x) just to remove the normalization constant Z from our target distribution p∗(x,h1,h2). Even after applying the lower-bound we still have to tackle the inference problem which manifests itself in form of the full combinatorial sum over h1 and h2 in equation (6). Although it seems intuitively reasonable to use a variational approximation on top of the bound p̃∗(x), we will here not follow this direction but rather use importance sampling to perform approximate inference and learning (see section 3). Combining a variational method with the bound p̃∗(x) is therefore subject to future work.\nWe can also argue that optimizing log p̃∗(x) instead of log p∗(x) is beneficial in the light of the original goal we formulated in section 1: To learn a generative model p∗(x) which is regularized to be close to the model q which we use to perform approximate inference for p∗. Let us assume we have two equally well trained models p∗θ1 and p ∗ θ2 : Ex∼D [ log p∗θ1(x) ] = E [ log p∗θ2(x) ] , but the expected bound p̃∗(x) for the first model is closer to the log-likelihood than the expected bound for the second model: E [ log p̃∗θ1(x) ] > E [ log p̃∗θ2(x) ] . Using equation (7) we see thatDB(pθ1 , qθ1) < DB(pθ2 , qθ2) which indicates that qθ1 is closer to p ∗ θ1 than qθ2 is to p ∗ θ2\n(when we measure their distance using the Bhattacharyya distance). According to our original goal we thus prefer solution p∗θ1 where the bound p̃ ∗(x) is maximized and the distance DB(p, q) minimized. Note that the decomposition (7) also emphasizes why our recursive definition q(x) =∑ h1,h2\np∗(x,h1,h2) is a consistent and reasonable one: Minimizing DB(p, q) during learning means that the joint distributions p(x,h1,h2) and q(x,h1,h2) approach each other. This implies that the marginals p(hl) and q(hl) for all layers l become more similar. This also implies\nAlgorithm 1 Training p∗(x) using important sampling with q as proposal for number of training iterations do • Sample example(s) x ∼ D from the training distribution for k = 1 to K do • Layerwise sample latent variables h(k) from q(h|x) • Compute q(h(k)|x) and p(x,h(k))\nend for • Compute unnormalized weights ωk =\n√ p(x,h(k))\nq(h(k) |x)\n• Normalize the weights ω̃k = ωk∑ k′ ωk′\n• Update parameters in p and q: Use gradient estimator 2 ∑ k ω̃k ∂ log p∗(x,h(k)) ∂θ\nend for\np(x) ≈ q(x) in the limit of DB(p, q) → 0; a requirement that most simple parametrized distributions q(x) could never fulfill. It is thus a piece of good fortune that the optimal, but intuitively clumsy definition q(x) = ∑ h1,h2\np∗(x,h1,h2) results in the likelihood expression (6), an expression that has no higher computational complexity and that has mostly the same basic structure as the likelihood expression for any other model containing latent variables."

      "text" : "Based on the construction of p∗(x) outlined in the previous section we can define a wide range of possible models. We furthermore have a wide range of potential training and appropriate inference methods we could employ to maximize log p̃∗(x). In this text we concentrate on binary latent and observed variables x and hl ∈ {0, 1}, and we will use simple sigmoid belief network layers for all our conditional distributions: P (x |y) = ∏ i B(xi |σ(Wi y + bi)) where B(a | b) refers to the Bernoulli distribution for value a with probability parameter b, and σ(·) is the logistic sigmoid function. For our top-level prior p(h2) we use a factorized Bernoulli distribution: p(h2) = ∏ i B(h2,i |σ(b2,i)).\nWe form an estimate of p̃∗(x) by using important sampling instead of the exhaustive sum over h1 and h2 in equation (6). We use q(h1|x)q(h2|h1) as the proposal distribution which is by construction easy to evaluate and to sample from:\np̃∗(x) = ∑ h1,h2 √ p(x,h1,h2) q(h1|x) q(h2|h1) 2 =  E\nh2∼q(h2|h1) h1∼q(h1|x)\n[√ p(x,h1,h2)\nq(h1|x) q(h2|h1)\n] 2\n'  1 K K∑ k=1 √√√√ p(x,h(k)1 ,h(k)2 ) q(h (k) 1 |x) q(h (k) 2 |h (k) 1 ) 2 = p̂∗(x) with h(k)2 ∼ q(h2|h1) h (k) 1 ∼ q(h1|x) .

The final gradient is determined by computing the normalized weighted average over the individual gradients (equation 11). These properties are basically inherited from the RWS training algorithm [9]. But in contrast to RWS, and in contrast to most other algorithms which employ a generative model p and an approximate inference model q, we here automatically obtain parameter updates for both p and q because we optimize p∗ which contains both. The resulting training method is summarized in algorithm 1."

We then successively update all layers drawing h(m+1)l ∼ p∗(hl|h (m) l−1 ,h (m) l+1) like in Gibbs-sampling. We here perform multiple up- and downward sweeps until we consider the chain converged. Whenever we sample the bottom layer x(m+1) ∼ p∗(x|h(m)1 ), we keep the non-corrupted elements of x̃ fixed.

We train a model with 6 hidden layers containing 800,800,600,450,350,150 latent variables. We set the learning rate to 3 ∗ 10−4 and use otherwise the same hyperparameters as in the previous experiments. The training of the model converges after ≈ 200 epochs. The importance sampling based estimators for log p̂ and log p̃∗ report a negative log-likelihood of 92.7 and 95.1 respectively (on the MNIST testset). Again, note that both overestimate the true model NLL by an unknown amount (see previous section).\nTo demonstrate that the model learned a reasonable concept of binarized digits we use algorithm 2 to draw samples. The results are visualized in Figure 1. The samples obtained from p∗(x) show almost always well defined digits with sharp (non-blurry) edges. But unfortunately they are biased: It draws more ones than any other digit. Note that the proposal samples drawn from p do not show any obvious bias. We nevertheless suspect that the failure of our model p∗ to correctly learn the prior distribution over different model classes is mostly due to p failing to learn an approximate variability of digit shapes: we observe that the estimator p̃∗(x) generally assigns a much higher probability to individual datapoints that resemble ones, than to datapoints that resemble other digit classes. This seems intuitively reasonable, because the variability within the class of ones is probably lower than the variability within other classes. One source of variability in binarized images is for example the blurry fringe of the strokes in the gray scale version of the original images. Digits with a shorter overall stroke length and with fewer gray pixels will result in binarized digits with lower variability. To compensate for the presumed lower variability within the class of ones (and their higher probability q(x)), p would have to propose more samples resembling other digits than one. With a more detailed analysis of this issue still outstanding we want to stress that the failure of our model to learn the correct digit-class distribution (10 classes) results in a relatively small loss in terms of log-likelihood compared to its ability to model a sharp and non-blurry distribution over the 784 pixels of the images.\nTo highlight the models ability to generate sharp digits we use the inpainting algorithm described in section 3.2 to reconstruct partially occluded images. To obtain the results in Figure 2 we ran 20 upand downward sweeps across all layers.\nA B\nIn Figure 1 C we show the histograms of the importance weights when we use p(x,h) as a proposal distribution for p∗(x,h) (top); and when we use q(h|x) as a proposal for p∗(h|x) (bottom). According to our goal formulated in section 1 both p and q should stay close to p∗. The weights of the former occur whenever we perform approximate inference (e.g. during learning); the weights of the latter occur when we sample from the model. Unsurprisingly we observe that the quality of both proposal distributions is roughly symmetric relative to the target distribution p∗. As a control we also plotted a histogram of the weights when p(x,h1|h2) is used as a proposal for p∗(x,h1|h2) – a sampling mechanism we never used for any of our algorithms, but that is totally symmetric to the histogram for the q(h|x) proposals. The resulting weight histogram was visually indistinguishable from the one we show in Figure 1 C (bottom)."

Note that our definition for p∗ forced us to choose a prior distribution q(x) which will be part of our generative model p∗(x,h). This is different from the typical variational approaches to train Helmholtz machines where we would think of q(h|x) solely as an approximate inference method given a training example x, and where q(x) would be the (empirical) training distribution – something we cannot assume because q(x) is part of our model p∗.\nBut many question remain open and are subject to future work: During our experiments we have not made any serious attempts to calculate the normalization constant Z. Knowing Z would enable us to report proper log-likelihood estimates (or tighter bounds) given some test data. For now we can just suspect that log 1/Z is significantly larger than 0 because our estimators for log p̂(x) and log p̃∗(x) report numbers that differ by multiple nats (for MNIST and TFD experiments). A first attempt to es-\ntimate Z could certainly be made by applying AIS [20] or RAISE [21]. Another direction for future research could involve semisupervised learning: The symmetric nature of the generative model p∗ (it is always close to the bottom-up and top-down directed models q and p) might make it suitable for learning tasks that require inference given changing sets of observed and hidden variables. And last but not least we have a wide range of potential choices for our parametrized conditional distributions. Assuming continuous latent variables for example and eventually choosing an alternative inference method might make p∗ a better suited model for some training distributions."

    "abstractText" : "Unsupervised training of deep generative models containing latent variables and performing inference remains a challenging problem for complex, high dimensional distributions. One basic approach to this problem is the so called Helmholtz machine and it involves training an auxiliary model that helps to perform approximate inference jointly with the generative model which is to be fitted to the training data. The top-down generative model is typically realized as a directed model that starts from some prior at the top, down to the empirical distribution at the bottom. The approximate inference model runs in the opposite direction and is typically trained to efficiently infer high probability latent states given some observed data. Here we propose a new method, referred to as geometric mean matching (GMM), that is based on the idea that the generative model should be close to the class of distributions that can be modeled by our approximate inference distribution. We achieve this by interpreting both the top-down and the bottom-up directed models as approximate inference distributions and by defining the target distribution we fit to the training data to be the geometric mean of these two. We present an upper-bound for the log-likelihood of this model and we show that optimizing this bound will pressure the model to stay close to the approximate inference distributions. In the experimental section we demonstrate that we can use this approach to fit deep generative models with many layers of hidden binary stochastic variables to complex and high dimensional training distributions.",
