      "text" : "Neural networks, especially convolutional neural network (CNN) [26], have been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks such as object recognition [7, 25]. A key to this success is that the neural networks allow appearance representation which is invariant of several image transformations such as small translation.\nAnother important class of tasks in computer vision is the inference of relations between two images. Two images can be related by object motion, camera motion or environmental factors such as lighting change. For these problems, instead of aiming for invariance of appearance changes, we want to detect and estimate these changes. For example, given two consecutive video frames, we want to infer the movement of each pixel from one image to the other (optical flow). For another example, given two images taken by a camera on a moving robot, we want to infer the ego-motion of the robot (visual odometry).\nThe traditional approach to perform the relation inference tasks is knowledge-based. By acquiring knowledge of a task and making reasonable assumptions for simplification, one designs an algorithm to perform the inference. A classic example is the Horn-Schunck algorithm for computing optical flow [14]. However, in situations where we lack sufficient knowledge or the assumptions fail, the knowledge-based approach may not perform well. For example, the Horn-Schunck algorithms assumes brightness constancy of the moving pixels. This assumption can be violated by many factors such as occlusion, shading and noise.\nAn alternative approach to solve the relation inference problem is learning-based [29]. From a collection of training data, we aim to learn a function\nz = F (x,y) (1)\nsuch that given two images x and y as inputs, the function will output their relation variables z. The relation variables can be rotation angle, motion field, affine transformation parameters, etc.\n∗Corresponding author. Email: yaolubrain@gmail.com\nCompared to the knowledge-based approach, the learning-based approach does not require sufficient knowledge or assumptions but a large amount of training images with ground-truth relation variables. When it is difficult to obtain the ground-truth for real world images, one can often resort to synthetic images rendered by graphics engines. An example is the Sintel dataset for learning optical flow [5]. Recently, the learning-based approach has been adopted to compute optical flow [8, 40, 3, 41, 34, 17], stereo disparity [28], camera motion [42] and visual odometry [23]. Some of the results are competitive to the knowledge-based methods. Note that relation learning can also serve as supervision for learning appearance representation, as demonstrated in learning ego-motion [2, 18] and robot actions [32].\nAdditionally, there are methods combining knowledge-based and learning-based approaches [45, 46, 37, 4, 43]. In these methods, a neural network is trained to match two image patches and a knowledge-based post-processing is applied on the matching results to output the relation variables. In this paper, we focus on the pure learning-based approach, that is, neural networks are trained in an end-to-end manner, given raw images as inputs and ground-truth relation variables as targets. Although a relation learning model can also be trained unsupervisedly [30, 22, 44], we restrict our discussion mainly to supervised learning.\nWhile both object recognition and relation inference can be treated as supervised learning tasks, the two tasks have much difference in nature. Object recognition aims for invariance of several image transformations (e.g. translation, rotation and scaling) but relation inference aims for equivariance of these transformations. For example, the conventional CNN with a pooling operation is known to be invariant of small translation. This property is suitable for object recognition but not for motion detection, whose goal is to estimate the translation. This difference should be kept in mind when designing a relation learning model.\nIn this paper, we propose a new relation unit, contrast association unit (CAU). We show that CAUs are suitable for relation learning tasks with analysis and experiments. We adopt a multiplicative update algorithm for learning the non-negative weights in CAUs. The multiplicative update algorithm is compatible with gradient descent algorithms for unconstrained weights. The whole neural network can be trained in an end-to-end manner.\nNext, in Section 2, we outline the general neural network architecture for relation learning. In Section 3, we introduce our proposed relation unit CAU. In Section 4, we present the multiplicative update algorithm for learning the non-negative weights in CAUs. In Section 5, we discuss models related to CAU. In Section 6, we present the experiments on the five relation learning tasks. Finally in Section 7, we discuss the limitations of our work and propose several directions for future research.\n2 Architecture\nAs illustrated in Figure 1, the general neural network architecture of many relation learning models [30, 8, 2] can be described as\na = f(x), h = R(a,b),\nb = f(y), z = g(h), (2)\nwhere x and y are the inputs (images), z are the targets (relation variables), f(·) is the feature extraction units, R(·, ·) is the relation units and g(·) is the readout units. f(·) and g(·) can be parametric functions such as neural networks. When the relation of two images is on the pixellevel (e.g. affine transformation), f(·) can be the identity function such that the relation units can directly apply on the image pixels. When the relation units R(·, ·) can directly output relation variables instead of a hidden representation, g(·) can also be the identity function. For example, in [30], both f(·) and g(·) are the identity function. For another example, in the simple version of FlowNet [8], f(·) is the identity function and g(·) is a CNN while in the complex version, both f(·) and g(·)\nare CNNs. The main focus of this paper is the relation units R(·, ·). A suitable relational representation can reduce the sample complexity and model complexity of learning g(·). We present two common types of relation units in below."

A bilinear unit models the pair-wise multiplicative intersection between two sets of input variables. It is equivalent to inner product whenWk is the identity matrix and equivalent to outer product since (4) can be written as hk = vec(Wk) T vec(abT ), where vec(·) denotes vectorization. Bilinear units have been used in learning image transformations in [30, 35]."

CAUs are defined as, for the k-th unit,\nhk = 1\n2\n∑\nij\nWijk(ai − bj) 2, (5)\nwhereWijk ≥ 0. Each CAU can be interpreted as a weighted sum of mismatches between a and b. The non-negative constraint on the weight matrices is indispensable since the mismatches should be non-negative to be accumulated. Otherwise, positive mismatches and negative mismatches would cancel each other.\nCompared to concatenation and bilinear units, CAUs have two advantages: (1) as the name suggests, CAUs model the contrast between two sets of variables such that R(a + c,b + c) = R(a,b), where c is a scalar applied on each element of a vector. This property is desirable for relation inference. For example, when a and b are the raw pixels, their relations should not be affected by their absolute pixel intensity level. (2) CAUs represent relations more explicitly. Each CAU stands for the matching error of a certain relation encoded by the weight matrix. An example is given in Section 3.2. This interpretablity also inspires the use of competition among CAUs as described below."

However, WTA is not differentiable and discards too much information. In practice, we can use softmin competition, defined as\nh′k = e−hk∑ i e −hi .

      "text" : "To learn the non-negative weights in CAUs (Wk for full rank or U and V for rank-one), the conventional gradient descent based algorithms are not suitable because the nonnegativity of weights cannot be maintained after each update. Simply projecting weights onto the space of the nonnegative matrices after each update performs poorly in our experiments, where the learning converges at an extremely low speed or even diverges in many cases.\nTo address the above problem, we adopt a multiplicative update algorithm for the non-negative weight matrices in a neural network, which was originally used for non-negativematrix factorization\n[27]. For a non-negative matrix W in a neural network and loss function E, we decompose the gradient into two positive parts ∂E ∂W\n= ∇+ −∇−, where the two positive matrices∇+ and∇− can be computed by\n∇+ = 1\n2\n( abs ( ∂E\n∂W\n) + ∂E\n∂W\n) + ǫ, (16)\n∇− = 1\n2\n( abs ( ∂E\n∂W\n) − ∂E\n∂W\n) + ǫ, (17)\nwhere abs(·) is the element-wise absolute value and ǫ is a small positive scalar applied to each element of a matrix. The multiplicative update algorithm is defined as\nW ← W ◦\n( ∇−\n∇+\n)η , (18)\nwhere η is the learning rate hyperparameter and the division and the exponentiation are both elementwise. If W is initialized to be positive, the updated matrix will remain positive since all factors on the right hand side are positive.\nIn practice, the multiplicative update algorithm can be used in a stochastic (or mini-batch) manner. Such use has been demonstrated in non-negative matrix factorization [36]. Note that the multiplicative update still requires the gradients calculated by back-propagation. The gradient calculation for CAU can be found in Appendix."

      "text" : "A classic model related to the proposed CAU is the energy model for motion detection [1] and stereo disparity [9]. Each unit of the energy model computes the sum of squares of two Gabor filter outputs. No learning is involved in the energy model. There are models which compute the sum of squares of learnable filter outputs such as adaptive-subspace self-organized maps (ASSOM) [21] and independent subspace analysis (ISA) [16]. Similar to CAU, ASSOM also has a competition mechanism (WTA). However, the goal of both ASSOM and ISA is to learn appearance features which are invariant of image transformations, as different from our goal. There is a line of research on relation learning based on Boltzmann machines [30, 38, 15]. While Boltzmann machines allow a probabilistic formulation of relation inference, the training of Boltzmann machines is much more expensive compared to their non-probabilistic counterpart. Non-negative weights have appeared in sum-product networks [33], multi-layer perceptrons [6] and natural image statistics models [10]. Our derivation of the low-rank approximation of CAUs follows from the low-rank approximation of bilinear units [30, 19]."

We treat the relation inference tasks as a machine learning problem and tackle it with neural networks. A key to the problem is learning a representation of relations. We propose a new neural network module, contrast association unit (CAU), which explicitly models the relations between two sets of input variables. Due to the non-negativity of the weights in CAU, we adopt a multiplicative update algorithm for learning these weights. Experiments show that neural networks with CAUs are more effective in learning five fundamental image transformations than conventional neural networks.",
