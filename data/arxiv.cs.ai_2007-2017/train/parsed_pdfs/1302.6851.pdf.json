      "text" : "Probability measures by themselves are known to be inappropriate for modeling the dynamics of plain belief and their excessively s�ong measura bility constraints make them unsmtable for some representational tasks, e.g. in the context of frrst order knowledge. In this paper, we are therefore going to look for possible alternatives and ex tensions. We begin by delimiting the general area of interest, proposing a minimal list of as�ump tions to be satisfied by any reasonable quasi-pro babilistic valuation concept. Within this frame work, we investigate two particularly interesting kinds of quasi-measures which are not or much less affected by the traditional problems. • Ranking measures, which generalize Spohntype and possibility measure�. . • Cumulative measures, wh1ch combme the pro babilistic and the ranking philosophy, allowing thereby a fine-grained account of static and dy namic belief.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe successful acting of cognitive agents in complex, opaque and dynamic worlds depends on their ability �o manipulate huge amounts of incomplete and unc_ertam in fonnation in a reasonable way. The representatJon of soft and partial know ledge together with the fonnaliza tion of the corresponding reasoning patterns are therefore major issues in artificial intelligence. Very roughly, �e can distinguish the following approaches to the modelmg of belief, i.e. of uncertain or revisable knowledge :\n• Strictly qualitative. Belief states are represented by specific prioritized sets of sentences (syntactic) [Weydert 92, Nebel92], or by some preference relation on possible worlds structures inducing an epistemic-entrenchment-like ordering on propositions (semantic) [Gardenfors, Makinson 88, 91].\n• Strictly quantitative. Belief states are characterized by classical probabilistic\nmeasures [Pearl 88] or by altemative numerical ac counts, e.g. belief functions [Shafer 76].\n• Semi-quantitative or semi-qualitative. . . Belief states are described by rough quahtatlVe mea\nsures assigning orders of magnitude [e.g. Spohn 88].\nFor most proposals, there are more or less _ s�itable application contexts, but altogether the� �s? exhtbtt so�e more or less serious shortcomings. Prionuzed sententtal belief models are interesting because of their simplicity and the absence of omniscience assumptions, but the lacking semantic foundations and the resulting ad hoc character relativize their usefulness. More generally, strictly qualitative syntax- or semantic-based comparative frameworks are not fine-grained enough to handle the complexities of real-world knowledg�. For instanc�, we cannot easily model belief strength differences or mde pendency constraints and our decision-theoretic conside rations have to stay rather rudimentary.\nAmong the numerical approaches, probability theory is certainly the best investigated and most successful formalism for modeling uncertain propositional know ledge. Even if its naive use mi�ht sometimes cause problems, it still appears to be the Ideal reference fonna Iism for more sophisticated or special-purpose representa tions, not to mention the practical importance of the powerful tools it provides. But there �e sev�ral ge�eral problems which have to be addressed, m particular 1f we want to handle changing or first-order belief states.\n• Agents cannot always associate exact numbers - e.g: _ probabilities reflecting betting intentions and/or statis� cal knowledge - with propositions. Very often, numen cal values are undefmed, unknown, irrelevant, cumber some or untractable, and more transparent, simpler models of reality are required, lowering the computa tional costs.\n• Standard conditionalization procedures in the traditional probabilistic context don't allow us to revise plain b�lief if we choose to implement it, quite naturally, by assig ning (subjective) probability 1.\n• The representation of complex fonns of (e.g. firSt-order) knowledge dealing with infinite structures is frequently blocked by unsatisfiable measurability constraints.\n576 Weydert\n• There are intuitive flaws, for insL.mce the gap between impossibility and probability 0 or the nonexistence of uniform distributions on countably infinite sets.\nTo a certain extent, all these problems can be solved in semi-qualitative quasi-probabilistic formal accounts based on abstract ranking measures. Their characteristic feature is that the value associated with the union of two sets is assumed to be, w.r.t. a given ranking order, just the maxi mum of the values attributed to the individual sets. This means less commitments by lower precision. Homo geneous countably infinite sets and proper impossibility are no longer barred and every ranking measure can be lif ted to the full power set. Related concepts have been used fairly successfully for multiple revisions of plain belief [Spohn 88], default reasoning [Weydert 91, Dubois, Prade 91, Goldszmidt, Pearl 92] and belief modeling [Weydert 94]. Their main disadvanL.'lge is that they can only provide a very rough picture, suitable for interpreting defaults but not for a (really) fine-grained decision-theoretic analysis. So, in some sense, quantitative and qualit.1.tive formalisms seem to offer complementary features which we might try to combine in a new type of mixed framework, possibly powerful enough for more realistic dymunic models of graded first-order belief.\nIn this paper, we are going to develop such an inte grated approach by considering natural generalizations of probability measures. We shall proceed in four steps. To begin with, we shall delimit the area of interest and single out the minimal conditions for reasonable quasi-proba bilistic valuation formalisms. Next, we shall introduce and discuss two particularly interesting subclasses of non classical quasi-measures. On one hand, we have the ran king measures, a coarse-grained semi-qualitative notion. On the other hand, we have the cumulative measures, a fine-grained extended quantitative-qualitative measure concept, which tries to accumulate the best of both worlds. To conclude, we shall sketch how cumulative measures may be used to model st.'ltic and dynamic belief.\n2 QUASI-MEASURES Traditional probabilistic measure spaces can be seen as triples of the form (� 1 P 1 V), where :8 = (B, u, n, -, 0, 1) is a a-algebra of events, i.e. a boolean algebra closed under countable joins (unions) and meets (intersections) with top 1 and bottom 0, V = (IR+, +, x, 0, 1, <) is the positive half of the ordered real number field, and the probability measure P is a function from B to I R+ s.t.\nP(1) = 1 and P(uAi) = I. P(Ai) for every countable set of n-disjoint Ai (a-additivity). For each such space, there is a corresponding conditional probability measure P( I ) : B x 8° -> fR+, which verifies :P(A r1 B)= 'P(A I B) x P(B) for B E 8° = {BE B I P(B) \"# 0}. In the context of P, At ... An are called (conditionally) independent given B E 8° iffP(riAij I B)= :P(Ail I B) x . .. x 'P(Ais I B) for each subsequence An ... Ais of At ... An.\nOur first task now will be to see how far we can relax all these requirements without giving up practical rele-\nvance for belief valuation or basic features of the proba bility calculus. In particular, we want to keep reasonable notions of conditioning and independency. On the other hand, our framework should be general enough to cover semi-qualitative Spohn-type formalisms like those in troduced for modeling defaults and revision. In the follo wing, we are going to propose a minimal list of assump tions to be satisfied by any structure claiming to support a reasonable form of generalized probabilistic reasoningl. Before, let's recall some useful algebraic notions.\n(G, *) is called a semi-group iff G ::F 0 and * is an associative operation on G. In (G, *),we call e neutral or the identity iff for all x E G, e * x = x * e = x and n absorptive iff for all x E G, x * n = n * x = n. A semi group (G, *) is a group iff it has an identity e and for all xEG, there is y E G s.t. x * y = y * x =e. (G, *·<) is called an ordered group iff (G, *) is a group, < is a linear ordering on G and for all x, x', y E G, x < x' implies x * y < x' * y).\nDefinition 2.1 (�1 R1 V) is a quasi-measure space with event algebra :8 = (8, u, n, -, 0, 1), valuation algebra V = (V, #, \" , n, e, «) (generalizing (IR+, +, x, 0, 1, <)) and quasi-measureR. : B -> V iff the postulates 1.0 - 1.9 hold\n1.0 B oolean structure : :8 = (B, u, n, -, 0, 1) is a boolean algebra.\nThe usual propositional connectives are fundamental rea soning tools. Infinitary closures are quite exotic.\n1.1 Valuation function: R. : B -> V is a function with R(O) = n, R(1) = e and R.(A u B)= R.(A) # R.(B) for n-disjoint A, B.\nBy measure intuitions. If An B = 0, R. (A u B) should only depend on R.(A) and R.(B). To grasp infinitesimal probabilies, we have to give up (full) a-additivity because of missing upper bounds in nonstandard analysis.\n1.2 Additive structure : (V, #) is a commutative semi-group with identity n.\nInduced by the boolean properties of u and 0 together with the 1.1 characterization of R.. Strictly speaking, this requirement only concerns the possible values of R., but we are going to extrapolate these algebraic properties to the whole structure.\n1.3 Multiplicative structure : (V, c ) is a commutative semi-group with identity e and absorptive n.\nBased on the boolean properties of n, 0, 1 and the desire to set :R(A n B) = :R(A) c :R(B) for intuitively inde-\n1 A different and slightly more opaque generalization of proba bility theory has also been developed by [Darwiche, Ginsberg 92]. Their account is weaker insofar as it allows partially ordered valuation structures.\npendent events A, B (• is meant to play the role of x), in particular for A, B E { 0, 1 } .\n1.4 Distributivity : \"tv, v', w (w o (v # v') = (w o v) # (w o v')).\nBacked by the distributivity of n over u and our conside rations above.\n1.5 Linearity : (V, «) is a linear ordering.\nFor decision-theoretic reasons and formal convenience. If necessary, we can model partiality by sets of valuations.\n1.6 Additive monotony : \"tv, v', w (v � v' \"\"'* v # w � v' # w).\nSuggested by the monotonic character of measures. To ac count for ranking measures, we need the weak version �-\n1.7 Multiplicative monotony : \"tv, v', w (v « v' & w \"# n \"\"'* v • w « v' • w).\nConditioning on an independent, non-empty event should not affect «-relationships.\n1.8 Additive accessibility : 'V v,v'(v!fv' \"\"'* 3w v#w=v')\nIt should be possible to attribute an arbitrary lower value to a proper subvent (valuation freedom). Then, the prin ciple follows from 1.1.\n1.9 Multiplicative accessibility :\n\"f v, v' (v !£ v' \"\"'* 3 w v' • w = v)\nThis condition is necessary if we accept valuation free dom and want a suitable conditional version of R.\nTo get a better understanding of these structures, we now consider some interesting easy consequences, e.g. the fact that !f or « can be defined from • .\nTheorem 2.1 Assuming 1.0 - 1.9, we have,\n1. \"tv n � v,\n2. 'Vv,v'(v�v'&v'#n \"\"'* 3=l w v'• w=v), 3. V'v, v' (v • v' = n & v' \"# n \"\"'* v = n), 4. V'v, v' (v !£ v' � 3 w � e v' • w = v), 5. V'v, v' (n « v, v' � e \"\"'* n « v • v' �e), 6. '<I A E B n � R(A) �e.\nProof:\n1. By multiplicative accessibility, v « n would impy that there is a w s.t. v = o a w = n, which is impossible. Using linearity, this gives usn� v.\n2. Because of multiplicative accessibility, we only have to show uniqueness. Suppose, we had v � v', v' \"#nand w \"# w' s.t. v' • w = v' • w' = v. W.l.o.g., we may as-\nGeneral Belief Measures 577\nsume w « w'. But this would contradict multiplicative monotony.\n3. Given n !f v' and v' a n = n, 2.1.2 allows us to infer from v' • v = n and v' \"# n that v = n.\n4. If there is a w s.t. v' \" w = v and w � e, either v = n � v', and we are done, or n « v, v', w (by 2.1.1, 2.1.3). Now, suppose that v' « v and consequently w «e. Then multiplicative monotony would give us v' • w « v • w « v • e = v, which contradicts our assumption. So we· must have v � v'. On the other hand, if v � v', then mul tiplicative accessibility guarantees the existence of a w s.t. v' • w = v. If e « w, multiplicative monotony gives us either v' = v' \" e « v' • w = v, which is impossible, or v !f v' = n. But then, v' • w = n = v for w = n �e.\n5. Multiplicative monotony and n « v, v' � e imply that n=n•�«v·��ea�=���\n6. By 2.1.1 and additive monotony, n �R(A) = n # R(A) !fR(-A) # R(A) = R(-A u A) = R(1) = e.\nNow we are able to give an explicit definition of condi tioning for quasi-measures.\nDefinition 2.2 For every quasi-measure space(�, R1 V), the associated conditional quasi-measure R( I): B x"

Obviously R(O I B)= n, R(1 I B) = e. What we still must prove is that R(A u A' I B) \"\" R(A I B) # R(A' I B) for n-disjoint A, A'. Ob viously, this holds for R(B) = n. For R(B) \"# n, by 2.1.2, it is enough to show that R((A u A') n B)= (R(A I B)# R(A' I B)) a R(B). But (R(A I B)# R(A' I B)) a R(B) = (R(A I B) • R(B)) # (R(A' I B) • R(B)) = R(A n B)# 'R(A' n B) = R((A n B) u (A' n B))= R((A u A' ) n B) by distributivity.\nAssuming n \"# e, the relevant ordered multiplicative sub structure of a giv'en valuation algebra V is characterized by the restriction of (V, \",«) to the interval ]n, e]«. Set I(V) = (]o, e]«, •, »),»being the converse of«.\nTheorem 2.3 I(V) is the positive half of an ordered commutative group.\nProof : Based on our definitions and 2.1.5, it is pos sible to show that I(V) is an ordered commutative semi-group with identity and minimum e. Now, exploi-\n578 Weydert\nting 2.1.2 (for inverse uniqueness), we cllil use a well known technique - integer construction from the na tural numbers - to built llil ordered commutative group\n(G, • ', «') whose positive half is isomorphic to I(V).\nOne way to distinguish valuation algebras is to consider the interaction patterns they induce between # and «. So, for every valuation context, we would like to know how much we have to add to an abstract quantity to get a bigger one. This amounts to investigate for every valua-\ntion algebra V = (V, #, �, n, e, «) the corresponding additive magnitude ordering ««, defined by v «« w iff w\n# v = w. It is easy to see that «« \"' � (by additive monotony) is both transitive (associativity of#) and anti symmetric (commutativity of #), but not n·ecessarily reflexive, e.g. if V = (IR+, +, x, 0, 1, <).Notice however that n «« n. Furthermore, it follows from additive mono tony and accessibility that<«< is .li-extendible, i.e. if v .5i x «« x' S! v', then we get v «« v' (by additive accessibility, v' = x' # w and therefore v' S! v # v' = v # x' # w' .5i x # x' # w' = x' # w' = v', i.e. v' # v = v').\nIn general, «« is much coarser than .li· Setting S(w) = { v I v «« w}, by extendibility an initial .5i-segment, there are basically three possibilities for each w : (1) S(w) = { n}, (2) {n} c: S(w) c: [n, w]«, (3) [n, w]«\"' S(w). In fact, we are going to show that it is enough to consider w ::::: e. In the following, let S P, S H and SR be the principles obtained by stating (1}, (2) resp. (3) for w =e.\nTbeorem 2.4 If n \"# e, for i = 1, 2, 3, (i) holds for e iff (i) holds for all x ::F. n.\nProof: The right-to-left direction is obvious.\n(1) Suppose S(e) = {n} and n \"# x = x # y for some y \"# n. W.I.o.g. we may assume y � x, otherwise, additive monotony would give us x S! x # x S! x # y = x and we could replace y by x. By multiplicative accessibility, there is v ::F. n s.t. y = x • v. Because e « e # v lli!d x * n, we have x = x • e « x • (e # v) = x # (x. • v) = x # y, which is impossible. Hence, (1) must hold for all x ::F. n.\n(2) Suppose x i= n and e = e # v « e # e for some v with n « v «e. Then x = x • e = x • (e # v) « x • (e # e)= x # x and n = x � n « x • v « x • e = x. In other words, there is y = x • v s.t. n « y « x and x = x • (e # v) = x • e # x • v = x # y « x # x. Consequently, (2) is verified for all X \"#D.\n(3) From e = e # e, we get x = x • (e # e)= x # x. That is, (3) is valid for alllL\nIt seems natural to assume that «« should define a linear hierarchy of additive magnitudes. This amounts to require that «« should be a (transitive) modular ordering, i.e. for each w, v «« v' should imply w <«< v' or v «« w.\nDefinition 2.3 A valuation algebra V = (V, #, •, n, e, «) is called hierarchical iff «« is modular.\nStandard (probabilistic) and non-standard real valuation algebras - based on the ordered real number field (lR+, +, x, 0, 1, <) resp. one of its elementary extensions including infinitesimals - will verify SP. Here,# is a very sensitive connective and adding non-zero quantities always makes a difference. In this context, «« is just {n }xV\\{n} and therefore modular. That is, these valuation algebras are trivially hierarchical. The remaining two configuration types SH and SR reflect different qualitative-quantitative philosophies, which we are going to investigate now.\n3 RANKING MEASURES The principle SR, which is equivalent to idempotence for #,characterizes what might be called pure semi-quantita tive quasi-probabilistic accounts. Adopting this condition considerably simplifies our valuation structure. First, it allows us to identify# with max«, because for n .S! x .S! y, we have y � x # y � y # y = y = max«{x, y}. Together with 2.1.5 and the absorptive character of n, this guaran\ntees that [n, e]« is closed for# and c. Furthermore, 2.1.6 gives us R.\"B '= [n, e ]«. Therefore, w.l.o.g., we may concentrate on SR-type valuation algebras of the form ([n, e]«, m�<, •, n, e, «). From 2.3 we know that this structure can be completely described by the positive half of an ordered commutative group which has been topped by an absorptive n. The converse of the resulting ex tended order is just our valuation ordering<<. Another in teresting consequence is that we can now drop the dis jointness condition in 1.1. Because we want to ensure that R(A) = n encodes real impossibility, unions of impos sible events should not be allowed to embrace a possible one. All this suggests the following definition extending previous proposals in [Weyden 91, 92].\nDefinition 3.1 C8, R., V) is called a ranking-measure space iff\n1. � = (B, u, n, -, 0, 1) is a boolean algebra 2. V = (V, a,«) (ranking algebra) is s.t.\n• (V\\{ n}, •, ») is the positive half of an ordered commutative group with identity e,\n• n is «-minimal and absorptive for c. 3. R: B -> V (ranking measure) is a function satisfying\nR(O) = n, R.(1) = e and R(A u B)= max«{'R(A), 'R(B) }.\n4. If A= U\\Pi I i E I} and for all i E I, R.(Pi) = n, then R(A) = n (coherence).\nObserve that coherence is automatically satisfied for com pact boolean algebras (i.e. where every covering of an event has a finite subcovering). What we still have to prove is that ranking measures really fit into our general quasi-measure framework.\nTheorem 3.1 Ranking-measure spaces are quasi-measure spaces and ranking algebras are hierarchical valuation algebras.\nProof: 1.0, 1.1 : obvious, 1.2, 1.3 : properties of max«, o and o, 1.4: absorptiveness of n together with the group ordering condition, 1.5, 1.6 : immediate, I. 7 : by the group ordering condition, 1.8 : take w = v', 1.9 : let's assume n � v � v' � e. If v:::: n, we choose w == n. If v o�= n, we consider the corresponding full group (cf. 2.3). Here, we can fmd a w with v' o w == v. If e « w, then v':::: v' o e « v' • w == v, which contradicts our assumption. Hence w � e. Ranking algebras are hierarchical because they verify � = <«<.\nRanking measures are the simplest instances of quasi measures. For every ordered commutative group Iii, we can defme a corresponding ranking algebra V(fi). Notice that we can embed V(Z) in each nontrivial V(Cii) (V o�= {n, e} ), Z = (Int, +, <) being the ordered additive group of integers. Other natural structures are V(Q) and V(R), for Q = (Rat,+,<), R = (IR, +,<).Ranking measures do not necessarily satisfy :R.(u( Ai I i E I})= sup«{:R.(Aj) I i E I} for mutually disjoint Aj. In the classical probabilistic framework, this relation can only be violated for un countable I. Here, it may fail for countable I. The boolean algebras are most of the time set algebras. In fact, we can often lift ranking measures to power set structures.\nTheorem 3.2 Let ClS, :R., V) be a ranking measure space where lS is a set algebra on S, the valuation ordering « is complete (i.e. «-infima exist) and n « inf« 1 :R.(P) J P E B, n « :R.(P) }. Then there is a canonical extension :R. * of :R. to the powerset structure lS* = (2S, u, n, -, 0. S) on S s.t. < :8 *, :R. *, V) is a ranking measure space and :R. * is the maximal extension w.r.t. the «-induced pointwise or dering on ranking-measures from lS * to v.\nProof sketch : :R. * defined by :R *(A) = in�< { :R.(P) I A � P, P E B} for A� S is as desired.\nIn the literature, ranking-measure-like notions have been considered for different purposes. In [Weydert 91], we have provided a simple ranking measure semantics for default conditionals and comparative modalities (formali zing negligibility) together with a corresponding axioma tic characterization. In [Weydert 93], this approach has been extended to default quantifiers, i.e. genuine first order contexts. A semantics for belief based on sets of ranking measures, different from what we discuss in this paper, can be found in [Weydert 94].\nA very influential and sophisticated framework has been proposed by Spohn [88, 90]. His ordinal conditional functions (OCF) are intended to measure relative dis belief and model iterated belief changes. Their domains have the form 2S \\{ 0} and the valuation structure is (Ord, +', <), with Ord being the class of ordinal numbers {0, 1, 2, ... w, w +' 1, ... , w +' 0>, w +' ro +' 1, ... }, +'the ordinal number addition and<' the converse of the ordi nal number ordering ( ... <' ro <' ... <' 1 <' 0). Because there is no absorptive value for 0 and, in particular, because+' is not commutative (w +' 1 o�- w == 1 +' w), his\nGeneral Belief Measures 579\napproach is not directly subsumed by ours. We could use another connective +0 based on polynomial representations (a:= anro�n +' ... +' a1 ro�1 +' ao). which is commu tative. But we still wouldn't get accessibility because there is no x with 1 +0 x = w. Of course, for Spohn's natural conditional functions (NCF), which take their values from Nat, this problem doesn't arise. Here, the valuation structure basically becomes V(Z). For many practical purposes, this might be enough. In [Goldszmidt, Pearl 92], for instance, this formalism has been used for modeling nonmonotonic inference with variable-strength defaults.\nPossibility measures [Dubois, Prade 91] are another related and quite popular quasi-probabilistic tool for reasoning about uncertainty. Here, the domains are power sets and the valuation structure is of the form ([0, 1], <). Because conditional possibility measures are defined through min, stronger c-like connectives are not con sidered. Spohn's account and possibility theory both assume that their measures are fully additive, i.e. R(A) = sup«{:R.({a}) I a E A). However, this shouldn't be a general postulate. If we want to avoid an infinitary form of the lottery paradox, we will need semi-quantitative measures :R. compatible with homogeneously small sin gletons, i.e. with v E V s.t . R( {a})= v « e for all a E S.\n4 CUMULATIVE MEASURES Probabilistic and ranking measures are situated at the extremes of the quasi-measure range. Both fairly popular, they are characterized by different strengths and weak nesses. Probabilities are well suited for a fine-grained, e.g. decision-theoretic analysis in finite or continuous contexts where precise numbers are available. For their semi-qualitative counterparts, quite the opposite is true. They are most appropriate when we are interested in a simple, cheap, rough, mainly number-free evaluation of plausibility, e.g. in default reasoning or (full) belief revi sian. When modeling plain belief, for instance, we want to avoid any confidence loss when conjoining two beliefs. Within the classical probabilistic framework, this can only be achieved by attributing measure zero to -, <p if <p is believed. However. when we have to revise our beliefs based on new evidence supporting -,<p we get into trouble bec��s� subsets of a null set cannot be differentiated pro babilJstJcally. For ranking measures, this problem doesn't arise. Here, believing <p means associating a non-ma ximal, but not necessarily minimal ranking measure value to --, <p. This guarantees that beliefs are closed under co�junction. At the same time, Spohn-type conditionali zatiOn allows us to formulate reasonable revision pro cedures. Furthermore, we do no longer have to care about measurability constraints, the prohibition of uniform countable sample spaces and the representation of im possibility. On �he other hand, everybody will agree that the repres\n_ entatwnal a�d inferential power of ranking\nmeasures ts rather restricted. In fact, it seems as if both formalisms were largely complementary. Consequently,\n580 Weydert\nwe should try to combine them in a powerful framework sharing the basic advantages of both.\nThe major issue is to extend the usual probabilistic framework far enou gh to allow differentiation among and especially con dit ioning on sets of vanishing probability. The idea is to introduce a hierarchy of mainly classical valu ation contexts such that from the perspective of any gi ven level, lower ranks are con sider ed negligible or ir relevant, i.e. would get probability zero within a standard interpretation . Our strategy i s to use a ranking algebra V = (V. c. «) for describing the rough, global hierarchical structure and the real probabilistic valuation algebra :R+ = (IR+, +, x, 0, 1, <),i.e. the standard positive real n um ber algebra, for the more conventional, fine-grained local structure. The main task is now to merge these structures in a suitable way. This is done by the fo llo wing defini tion .\nDefinition 4.1 LetV\" = (V0, max«, c0, no. e0, «0) be a ranking and '.R.+ = (IR+, +, x, 0, 1, <)be the real valuation algebra. Then we call H(V0, R+) = ( H(V0, '.R.+), #, c, n, e, «) a cumulative algebra with global structure V0 and local structure R.+ iff\n• H(V0, R+) := { (n, 0)} u V'\\{n}xlR+ \\{0}, and for all (a, r), (a', r') E H(V0, R+),\n• (a, r) #(a', r') =(a, r + r') if a= a', =(a', r') if a «0a', ::; (a, r) if a' «0a,\n• (a, r) c (a', r') = (a c 0a ', r x r'),\n• n = (n°,0)ande = (e0,1),\n• (a, r) «(a', r') iff a «0a' or (a= a' and a< a').\nThe definition of H(V0, :.R+) as a proper subset of V0xlR+ excluding (n°, r) for r t:. 0 and (a, 0) for a 1= n° ensure s that there are no zero-divisors (x, y t:. n w it h x c y = n, e.g. for x = (a, 0) and y = (n°, r)) or trivial violations of multiplicative monotony by (a, 0) * n, (e, r) « (e, 1) and (a, 0) c (e, r) =(a, 0) c (e, 1). For the multiplicative con nective, the componentwise strategy is the obvious one to guarantee those properties which are required for enco ding independency (cf part 2). The lexicographic order ing reflects our basic stratification philosophy. Finding an appropriate additive connective, however, is less straight forward. Within single ranks (a = a'), we must adopt the pointwise approach (a, r) #(a', r') =(max« {a, a'}, r + r'), because distributivity and the intended isomorphism bet ween { e} xR+ \\{ 0} and R+ \\ { 0 I (i.e. real valuation algebra at the top) allow the derivation of (a, r) # (a, r') = ((a, 1) c (e, r)) #((a, 1) c (e, r')) =(a, 1) c ((e, r) # (e, r')) =(a, 1) c (e, r + r') = (a, r + r'). But additions in vo lvin g different ranks cannot be handled that way. To satisfy additive ac cessibility, e.g. to pass from (a, 1) with a «0e to the bigger value (e, r) for r < 1, we would have to introduce negative num be rs on the right-hand-side, which simply doesn't make sense. In fact, it would again bring in oddities like\n(a, 0) for at:. n°. Notice that multiplicative acces sibili ty already has brought us to consider (a, r) with 1 < r to get from (e, 1/r) to (a, 1). Taking all these precautions, our structures are well-behaved.\nTheorem 4.1 Cumulative algebras are hierarchical valua tion algebras. They verify S H if the ranking algebra is no n-trivial (V0# {D0, e0}).\nProof: Let H(V0 , :.R+) = (H(V0, R+), #, c, n, e, «) be a cumulative algebra.\n1. Jl.(V0, R+) is a valuation algebra.\n1.2 Additive structure. Commutat ivity and the neutrality of n::: (n°, 0) are obvious. To see that associativity holds, consider any ((a, r) #(a', r')) #(a\", r\") and (a, r) #((a', r') # (a\", r\")). If one left component is bigger than the other two, the sums are just identical to the corresponding pair. If the left components are equal, we can use the associa tivity of +. If only two of them are iden tical and the remaining one is smaller, we can drop the associated pair and the above expressions become equal to the sum of the former .\n1.3 Multiplicative structure. Obvious because of the co r responding properties for (V0, c0) and (IR+, x).\n1.4Distributivity. If a' =a\", then (a,r) c ((a', r')#(a\",r\"))= (a o0a', r X (r' + r\")) := (ac0a',r X r' + r x r\") = (ac0a', r X r')\n# (a c 0a\", r x r\") = ((a, r) c (a', r')) # ((a, r) c (a\", r\")). If a' «0a\", then (a, r) c ((a', r') #(a\", r\")) =(a, r) c (a\", r\") = ((a, r) c (a', r')) # ((a, r) \" (a\", r\")) by the multiplicative monotony of o0 or, if a= no and r = 0, by absorption.\n1.5 Linearity. Follows directly from that of «0 and <.\n1.6 Additive monotony. If a «0 b «0 a', then (a, r) « (a', r') implies (a, r) c (b, s) = (b, s) «(a ', r') =(a', r') c (b, s). The rem aining possibilities are immediate.\n1.7 Multiplicative monotony. Immediate from the multi plicative monotony ofV0 and R+ and n = (n°, 0).\n1.8 Additive accessibility. If (a, r) « (a', r'), then we have either a��o a' and (a, r) #(a', r') =(a', r'), or a= a' and r < r' and the additive accessibility of 1t+ gives us r\" with (a, r) #(a, r\") = (a', r').\n1.9 Multiplicative accessibility. By the corresponding fea ture ofV0 and :.R+ and the definition of H(V0, R.+)·\n2. Jl.(V0, :.R+) is hierarchical. (a, r) «« (a', r') iff (a', r') # (a, r) = (a', r') iff a «0a' or (a, r) = (n°, 0), which describes a modular relation.\n3. SH holds. (e0, 1) #(a, r) = (e0, 1) for some (a, r) with (n°, 0) « (a, r) « (e0, 1), which exists by V0's nontriviality.\nThe next defmition now introduces our main concept.\nDefinition 4.2 A quasi-m easure whose valuation algebra is a cumulative algebra is called a cumulative measure.\nNotice that real measures can be seen as special cumula tive measures using the trivial ranking algebra, i.e. where V 0 = ( { o0, e0} , � 0, «0). The main purpose of our cumula tive constructions is to provide a general, quasi-proba bilistic framework supporting something like shifting gra nularity. Locally, we are dealing with a classical nume rical context, but globally, we adopt the ranking perspec tive. Conditioning allows us to pass between levels and, as we shall see, to model plain belief revision without being forced to give up all the useful classical proba bilistic or measure-theoretic tools. The idea is to use the (top-ranked) local probabilities for decision-theoretic purposes and the global ranking structure for revision tasks. Of course, we have to expect that some features get lost. Completeness, for instance, can at best be guaran teed within bounded segments of ranks. That is, there might well be disjoint Ai, e.g. with R(AD = (a, i) for i E\nNat, where sup« { R(Ai)l i E Nat } doesn't exist. On the other hand, we are no longer troubled by measurability constraints. Every cumulative (and therefore every proba bilistic) measure on a set-algebra can be extended to a cumulative measure on the whole powerset\nTheorem 4.2 Let C B , R, H(V, :R+) ) be a cumulative measure space where :B is a set algebra on S and R + = (lR+, +, x, 0, 1, <). Then there is an extension R * of R to the powerset structure :B* = (2s, u, n. -, 0. S) on S and a ranking algebra V* s.t. R * is a cumulative measure and V a substructure of V*.\nThis result is different from our corresponding theorem 3.2 for ranking measures insofar as here, in general, we don't have neither a canonical extension nor constant valuation algebras (i.e. V = V ').\nAnother proposal to reconcile the advantages of probabilistic and ranking measures has been made by Boutilier [Boutilier 93). Roughly speaking, the structures he considers could be interpreted as special, restricted instances of cumulative measure spaces. Basically, his approach has been designed for finite boolean algebras, but - to a certain extent - it can be generalized to infinite ones. The idea is to have a possibility ranking on atoms and a probability measure 1lr attached to each level r which vanishes for measurable propositions built up from atoms of other ranks. Given an event A, we look for the highest rank r where its probability 1lr(A) becomes stric tly positive. Boutilier doesn't present a fully integrated account with combined valuation scales, but in our termi nology, A would get the value (r, 1lr(A)).\nThe approach, as it stands, has several shortcomings. First of all, it relies on possibility measures, which are not general enough for some purposes (e.g. for modeling infmite boolean algebras based on countably many small atoms). Secondly, his definition forces us to use well founded rankings, which seems to be a quite artificial res triction. In fact, the only well-founded ranking algebras are V(Z) and the trivial one. But the main problem with Boutilier's theory is that it doesn't really fit into the quasi measure framework. Because the local values are sup-\nGeneral Belief Measures 581\nplied by probabilistic valuations, they cannot exceed 1 . Consequently, multiplicative accessibility will fail, i.e. there will be no smooth account of conditional measures and our valuation freedom will be severely restricted. For instance, we may encounter valuated events, less \"pro bable\" than their complements, for which there can't be another event which is exactly two times as \"probable\". So, it seems justified to say that Boutilier's formalism achieves only a partial integration of the quantitative and the qualitative viewpoint.\n5 BELIEF STRUCTURES Traditionally, epistemic states of ideal agents have often been represented or approximated by probabilistic or dis crete ranking measures on world sets. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, these pure approaches exhibit serious weaknesses. The first one, for instance, fails either to represent (by admitting full beliefs with probabilities below 1) or to revise plain belief (trivialization by condi tioning on null sets). It also runs into problems because of measurability constraints affecting the realization of countably infmite uniform belief spaces. The second one, on the other hand, is unsuitable for fine-grained represen tation and decision-taking tasks where it makes a dif ference whether one option is as or twice as plausible as another one (which cannot be expressed by ranking measures). In particular, there is no possibility to model statistical knowledge directly by Spohn-type degrees of belief. Basically, these problems call for refined valuation structures backing the necessary differentiations. Of course, this can be done in many different ways. Either indirectly and hidden by a sophisticated machinery [Bac chus et al. 92] , or directly, by combining complementary uncertainty formalisms, as we do. In the following, we are going to sketch some ingredients of an epistemic framework based on cumulative measures, which allows a correct handling of our benchmarks.\nFirst of all, we have to address the question about the nature of epistemic states. Here, we want to adopt a libe ral attitude. Epistemic states should not be identified with any kind of measures. This would be an oversimplifica tion contradicting our subjective experience of what cons titutes real-world belief (inconsistency, partiality, vague ness, mixture of qualitative and quantitative contents, deductive incompleteness, . . . ). What we will assume, however, is that any given epistemic state s can be inter preted or evaluated so as to provide a cumulative measure 'Rs describing the corresponding official, surface belief structure, to be exploited for practical purposes like decision-tasks. This approach might be called the projec tion model of belief. The domain of Rs is formed by the propositions of our actual language (state) u, which we assume to be boolean. The valuation algebm is assumed to be non-trivial . Backed by the pleasant properties of cumulative measures, we can now represent plain belief in the traditional way without having to care about the shortcomings of the probabilistic account. Let's express \"within the epistemic state s , A is plainly believed\" by s I= B(A).\n582 Weydert\nPlain belief : s I= B(A) iff Rs(A) = (e0, 1)\nWhat's important is that this doesn't force us to stipulate Rs(-,A) = (D0, 0), i.e. the impossibility of -,A, because (e0, 1) = :Rs(T) = Rs(A v -,A) = :Rs(A) # :Rs(-,A) = (e0, 1) # (a, r) is possible and true for (n°, 0) « (a, r) « (e0, 1). Plainly believing A is not the same as rejecting the possibility of -,A. Also, we can differentiate between beliefs with regard to their revisability or epistemic en trenchment by attributing either bigger or smaller mea sure values to their complements (cf. below). A basic characteristic of plain beliefs is their closure under conjunctions.\nConjunctive closure : If Rs(A), :Rs(A') = (e0, 1), then Rs(A & A') = (e0, 1)"
    }, {
      "heading" : "This holds because :Rs(-,A v -,A') = max« {R.s(--,A),",
      "text" : "Rs(--,A')) «« (e0, 1). Of course, we may also adopt less certain attitudes and assign intermediate values. Indif ference w.r.t. A, for instance, mnounts to state 'R.s(--,A) = Rs(A) = (e0, 0.5). In first-order contexts, it is easy to imagine situations where the additive structure of clas sical valuation algebras becomes inappropriate. For ins tance, let 'l'(x) be an opaque number-theoretic property for which we know that there is exactly one solution, but where we cannot give any bounds. Then, it seems reason able to adopt a symmetric attitude, which can easily be realized within our cumulative framework. Let's assume that .Ls is powerful enough to express 'P(.n.), the .n. being natural number constants.\nInfinitary uniformity � :Rs('l'(Q)) = :Rs('l'(l)) = . . . = {a, 1) «« {e0, 1), e.g.\nIn addition, we need of course a possibly nondeterministic revision mechanism N which, given an epistemic state s and a new item of information i, defines a set of possible updates N[i ](s). In general, i will be a constraint for the cumulative measures :Rs' of admissible revision states s' , e.g. i = [:R (A) = (e0, 1)] . A minimal condition for this 'N[i] can be borrowed from the classical paradigm.\nTop-conditionalization : Rs'(B) = Rs(B I A) if :Rs(B I A) has the form (e0, r)\nWe cannot require full conditionalization because this would force us to accept :Rs'(--,A) = :RS:--,A I A) = (0°, 0), precluding nontrivial updating with -,A. That is, we would be confronted again to the problems of the tradi tional framework, we want to escape.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the German Ministery of Research and Technology under grant ITS 9102, project LOGO.
