      "text" : "Discovering a new covert medium is one of the fundamental problems in espionage [5]. With the advent of genotype-chip technologies, individual genotyping has become less expensive [15], and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in turn has become covert medium. A gram of DNA contains approximately 1021 DNA bases (108 terabytes), which suggests that only a few grams of DNA can store all information available [18]. DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are a ractive for data storage because they allow large amounts of\n∗Corresponding author should be addressed. S.

[55] demonstrated that living organisms can be used as a data storage media by inserting arti cial DNA into arti cial genomes and using a substitution cipher coding scheme. is technique is reproducible and successfully inserts four watermarks into the cell of a living organism [19]. Several other encoding schemes have been proposed [10, 51]. e DNA-Crypt coding scheme [23] translates a message into 5-bit sequences, and the ASCII coding scheme [26] translates words into their ASCII representation, converts them from decimals to binary, and then replaces 00 with adenine (A), 01 with cytosine (C), 10 with guanine (G), and 11 with thymine (T).\nWith the development of DNA hiding schemes, hidden messages can be concealed in an organism’s DNA using steganography. Any digital data such as text or images can be inserted into a DNA sequence using the aforementioned coding schemes. us, the development of forensic tools, namely, steganalysis for DNA steganography, was inevitable. However, the current versions of detection schemes were developed to detect hidden messages in text, images, audio, and video media. For example, Benne [7] exploits text material according to le er frequency, word frequency, grammar style, semantic continuity, and logical methodologies. e advent of detection techniques based on statistical analysis, neural networks, and genetic algorithm [38] methods have been developed for today’s most common covert objects of digital images, video, and audio.\nAlthough detection schemes exist, conventional detection methods have not been applied to DNA sequences. We propose some methods for DNA steganalysis using the sequence analysis framework and denoising tools. However, these methods are o en restricted by the robustness of the target prediction, and miss important signals during spli ing and merging procedures [33]. To overcome the aforementioned limitations of frequency analysis, sequence alignment, and denoising tools, we propose a method based on introns/exons analysis and our previous work using splice junction prediction (GT or AT) which has gained popularity as an alternative to the machine learning approach.\nOur method uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are arti cial neural networks in which connections between units form a directed cycle. ese feedback loops create an internal network\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 44\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n7 A\npr 2\nstate that allows RNNs to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Learning temporal behavior enables DNA sequence pa ern recognition to investigate omics data [31, 34, 41]. Among the various sequence modeling tasks, RNNs [21, 39] are used to obtain a robust prediction result by learning the internal structure (introns and exons) of DNA sequences.\nIn this paper, we propose a DNA steganalysis method using sequence analysis (i.e., denoising tools [32, 43, 48, 57], and splice junction classi cation [31, 34]) for detecting hidden messages. We investigate a variety of machine learning methods for splice junction classi cation for detecting hidden messages and compare them with denoising tools and sequence analysis. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed method using RNNs achieves the best performance when compared to other learning methods including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and adaptive boosting for the current DNA steganography schemes listed in Table 1.\ne remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the concept of steganography and steganalysis and their association to DNA internal structures. In Section 3, we provide our proposed RNNs model architecture and also show that current DNA steganography schemes are theoretically not secure. In Section 4, we discuss experimental results from various machine learning, denoising, and sequence alignment methods. We conclude our paper in Section 5."

      "text" : "In molecular biology, DNA information ows from DNA to RNA by means of transcription and to protein by translation. Four types of nucleotides, (A, C, G, and T) are translated into 20 types of amino acids according to the genetic code, except for three stop codons (TAA, TAG, and TGA). An mRNA corresponds to DNA except that in RNA, T is replaced by uracil (U). With 4 nucleotides, 43 = 64 possible combinations of codon exist, whereas only 20 amino acids exist.\ne translation of multiple codons into single amino acid allows for degeneracy in the genetic code. For example threonine can be derived from ACU, ACC, ACA, and ACG and the third base does not exert any in uence on the translation to protein sequences. ese mutations of synonymous substitution allow potential exploits to embed information in the DNA sequences. A technique that hides secret messages through original les such that the existence of the secret message is unknown is called steganography. We describe this technique in detail in the following section."

      "text" : "Original les can be text, images, audio, or DNA sequences. A er hidden messages are embedded, an original le is referred to as a steged-medium. It is used as a communication channel for hiding the existence of the message itself, thus making it di cult for a third party to nd the message. In addition, the steganography scheme can also be used as watermarking for intellectual property. e signature in watermarking indicates the ownership of the data and ensures copyright protection.\nHiding a message into a DNA sequence has become topic of scienti c investigation since it was rst proposed by Clelland et al. [14] and has gained popularity over the last 10 years. e scheme for hiding data in a DNA sequence was rst proposed using a microdot technique[14] . Leier et al. [35] proposed a robust encryption scheme using a primer as the key sequence. A public DNA sequence is used as a reference and the selected primer and encrypted sequences are sent to the receiver. e primer is short complementary DNA sequences that depend on each proposed scheme. Leier et al. [35] uses complementary pairs of (A → T, T → A, C → G, and G→ C) whereas that Shiu et al. [47] uses complementary pairs of (A → C, C → G, G → T , and T → A) for an encryption scheme. ese DNA steganography schemes are claimed to be secure if primers and a reference sequence are not known. However, we will show that hidden messages are detectable without knowing primers despite their claim (see section 3)."

      "text" : "Steganalysis operates in two modes. e rst method involves removing the watermark(s) signal, which is processed by scanning. e second method involves compressing while detecting a portion of a ciphertext by frequency or entropy measurements. Traditional data hiding approaches usually embed a secret message into the images and audio les [56, 58]. However, with the advent of detection schemes, even very small distortions of images can easily detected[53]. However, the conventional DNA steganalysis methods do not work with DNA steganography. is is because a biochemical approach is required to extract DNA sequences and a biological process (transcription/translation) makes it di cult to encrypt/decrypt secret messages."

      "text" : "Genomic sequences contain both exons (coding regions) and introns (non-coding regions). ese two regions are utilized depending on whether the task is one of data storage or transport. Intron regions are a candidate for transportation because not all regions are transcribed to RNA regions and removed by splicing [28, 36] during transcription. is functionality provides vast space for hiding data, creating potential covert channels. By contrast, the data must be resistant to degradation or truncation in data storage (watermarking). Exons are one suitable candidate for storage because the sequences are carried over a er the translation and transcription processes [46]. ese two components of internal structures in eukaryote genes are involved in DNA steganography as payload (watermarking) or carrier (covert channel). e use of DNA sequences as payloads or carriers varies from algorithm to algorithm, as shown in Table 1.\nFigure 1 shows the learned representations for each coding and non-coding region projected into a two-dimensional (2-D) space using t-SNE [37]. e learned representations of introns and exons are denoted by green stars and blue squares, respectively. Some parts of the regions overlap in a 2-D space which can be interpreted to mean that shared pa erns exist between introns and exons. e position of introns and exons will change if hidden messages are embedded. Hidden messages are readily detectable if a clear separation exists, but the shared pa erns make detection di cult. A distinct, clear separation somehow overcomes the limited representation of DNA sequences [18]. us, clear separations of these shared pa erns are one important factor in constructing a classi cation model for detecting hidden messages."

      "text" : "A random oracle model[6] o ers a middle ground between a full proof of security and no proof at all. rough the random oracle model, the encryption scheme E can be evaluated by querying an oracle that returns m̂ given input m. Assume that we have the random oracle that acts like current steganography scheme E such that any adversaryA breaks the random oracle with only negligible probability. By this assumption, steganography scheme E can be bounded by the soundness design [12].\ne security of the random oracle is based on an experiment involving an adversary A, and A’s indistinguishability of the two encryptions. e experiment can be de ned for any encryption scheme E over message space D and for adversary A. e experiment is de ned as follows:\n(1) e random oracle chooses a random steganography scheme E. Scheme E modi es or extends the process of mapping a sequence of length n input to a sequence of length n of random sequence as the output. A process of mapping sequences can\nbe viewed as a table indicating for each possible inputm to the corresponding output value m̂. (2) Adversary A chooses a pair of sequencesm0,m1 ∈ Di . (3) e random oracle picks a bit b ∈ {0, 1} and sends encrypted\nmessage m̂ := E(mb ) to the adversary. (4) e adversary outputs a bit b ′. (5) e output of the experiment is de ned as 1 if b ′ = b, and 0\notherwise. A succeeds in the experiment in the case of distinguishingmb . With the experiment , the de nition of perfect security for E takes the following general form:\nDe nition 3.1. e scheme E is perfectly secure over message space D if for every adversary A it satis es\nPr[experiment] = 12 . (1)\nIn the encryption scheme E, A cannot distinguish betweenm0 and m1. A learns no information about the presence of a hidden message.\nIn the real-world, most systems do not have access to a random oracle. us, pseudorandom function is typically applied by replacing the random function, which remains secure using soundness design. With the assumption, the oracle is replaced by a xed encryption scheme E which corresponds to a transformation of a real system (implementation of the encryption scheme). An implementation of a random oracle is determined to be secure if the success probability of random oracle a ack is negligible. Moreover, encryption scheme E is soundness secure if adversary A has a success probability such that\nPr[success] ≤ 12 + neдliдible . (2) Using this notion of an implementation, we demonstrate breaking previous experiment using proposed method detecting hidden messages. (1) We construct MDi that runs on random oracle where selected\nspecies Di ∈ D. Note that a model M can be based on any classi cation models, but the key to select a model is to reduce the sparsity. Our proposed model M is described in Section 3.4.\n(2) Adversary A computes a standard deviation value of pm .\n(3) A computes y using MDi (mi ) givenmi ∈ Di . (4) A computes ŷ using MDi (m̂) given the output m̂. (5) e m̂ is successfully detected if y − ŷ > ϵ . is gives a probability of two independent y and ŷ from MDi . In section 4, we show that output messages are distinguishable through our proposed RNNs model with a success probability greater than 12 + ϵ .\nIn the following, we evaluate the security of steganography scheme using information theoretical proof based on entropy H [8].\nLemma 3.2. DNA steganography scheme is not secure if H (D) > H (D̂|D).\nProo f . e mutual joint entropy H (D, D̂) = H (D) + H (D̂|D) is the union of both entropies for distribution D and D̂. According to Gallager [17], the mutual information of I (D; D̂) is represented I (D; D̂) = H (D) − H (D|D̂). It is symmetric in D and D̂ such that I (D; D̂) = I (D̂;D), and always non-negative. e conditional entropy between two distribution is 0 if and only if the distributions are equal. us, the mutual information must be zero to de ne secure DNA steganography schemes:\nI (C; (D, D̂)) = H (C) − H (C|(D, D̂)) = 0. (3) where C is message hiding space and it follows that:\nH (C) = H (C|(D, D̂)). (4) Eq (3) means that the amount of entropy H (C) must not be decreased based on the knowledge of D and D̂. It follows that the secure steganography scheme is obtained if and only if:\n∀i ∈ N,mi ∈ D,m̂i ∈ D̂ : mi = m̂i . Considering that representations of m̂ are limited, satisfying the condition is nearly impossible because the current steganography schemes are all based on the assumption of addition or substitution. Because C is independent of D, the amount of information will increase over distribution D if hidden messages are inserted over distribution D̂. We can conclude that the schemes are not secure under condition H (C) > H (C|(D, D̂)). is means that one should not be surprised if a model exists that breaks the encryption scheme of a random oracle.\n!"

As shown in Figure 3, the splice junction site contains consensus strings called canonical splicing pa erns and the most frequent pa erns are dimer GT (called donor) and dimer AG at introns/exons boundaries [11]. e boundary between exons and introns referred to as the splice junction site.\nIn the proposed model, we use a set of DNA sequences that label introns and exons. ese sequences are converted into a binary vector by orthogonal encoding [4]. It employs nc -bit onehot encoding. For nc = 4, {A,C,T,G} is encoded by\n〈[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]〉.

An autoencoder is an arti cial neural network used to learn meaningful encoding for a set of data in a case involving unsupervised learning. An autoencoder consists of two components; an encoder and decoder. e encoder RNN encodes x to h, and the decoder RNN decodes h to the reconstructed x̂ thus minimizing the reconstruction errors\nL(x, x̂) = ‖x − x̂‖2 (6) where h is the representation of sequence features learned by features. rough unsupervised learning of the encoder-decoder model [49], we obtain representations of inherent features, which are directly connected to the second activation layer. e second layer is RNNs layer used to construct the model. e model in turn is used to determine pa erns between canonical and non-canonical splice signals. We then obtain the tuple of\nh =< h1, · · · , hd > (7) which is a representation of introns and exons in hidden layers, where d are a dimension of a vector. e features h learned from the autoencoder are connected to the second stacked RNN layer, which consists of our proposed architecture for outpu ing classi cation probability for the given sequence Di ∈ D.

We randomly selected 63,454 of 229,225 unique exons to remove duplicate exons caused by alternative splicing [28]. In addition, three samples were generated according to Noordewier\net al.

Orthogonal encoding, such as one-hot coding [4], is widely used to convert DNA sequences into numerical format. It employsnc -bit one-hot encoding. Fornc = 4, {A,C,T,G} is encoded as described in Eq( 5).\nAccording to Lee et al.

We evaluated the performance of our proposed method based on four supervised learning algorithms (RNNs, SVM, random forests, and adaptive boosting) for detecting hidden messages. For the performance metric, we used accuracy di erences in which accuracy1 is the widely used measure. With the performance matrix, we evaluated learning algorithms with respect to the following three regions listed in Table 1; introns dedicated, exons dedicated, and both regions together.\nFor each algorithm, we generated simulated data for a di erent number of samples (100,200,300,400,500, and 1000) using the UCSChg38 dataset [27]. We also randomly selected 100 cases for the xed sample size for each modi cation rate according to Table 1. With selected samples, we obtained the average prediction accuracy of a di erent number of samples against non-perturbed samples for 100 randomly selected cases. In the next step, we used the generated data according to the Table 1 modi cation rate to obtain prediction accuracy for 10 cases. Using averaged prediction accuracy of perturbed and non-perturbed, we checked the di erences between the prediction accuracy rates for a di erent number of samples.

However, we expect that counter-measures will be developed to foil our detection scheme. e future development of such techniques will automate hyperparameter tuning. According to Alvarez and Salzmann [1], the numbers of layers and neurons of deep networks can be determined using an additional group sparsity regularizer to the objective function. e sizes of vectors of grouped parameters of each neuron in each layer are incur penalties if the loss converges. e in uenced neurons are removed if the neurons are assigned value of zero."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed the rst DNA-steganalysis based on splice junction framework using RNNs. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • A new DNA-steganalysis method is proposed using RNNs. • Increased robustness is achieved using unsupervised to super-\nvised learning. • e improved method detects hidden messages while nding\ncanonical/non canonical signals that are o en missed by sequence analysis framework.\nWe believe that adopting our methodology will extend the eld of DNA-steganalysis. For a future work, we plan to extend our model using automated hyperparameter tuning and applying it to diverse datasets in DNA sequences."

    "abstractText" : "e technique of hiding messages in digital data is called a steganography technique. With improved sequencing techniques, increasing aempts have been conducted to hide hidden messages in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences which have been become a medium for steganography. Many detection schemes have developed for conventional digital data, but these schemes not applicable to DNA sequences because of DNA’s complex internal structures. In this paper, we propose the rst DNA steganalysis framework for detecting hidden messages and conduct an experiment based on the random oracle model. Among the suitable models for the framework, splice junction classication using deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is most appropriate for performing DNA steganalysis . In our DNA steganography approach, we extract the hidden layer composed of RNNs to model the internal structure of a DNA sequence. We provide security for steganography schemes based on mutual entropy and provide simulation results that illustrate how our model detects hidden messages, independent of regions of a targeted reference genome. We apply our method to human genome datasets and determine that hidden messages in DNA sequences with a minimum sample size of 100 are detectable, regardless of the presence of hidden regions.",
