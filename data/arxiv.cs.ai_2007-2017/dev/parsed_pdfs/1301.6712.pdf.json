      "text" : "Most fuzzy systems including fuzzy decision support and fuzzy control systems provide out puts in the form of fuzzy sets that represent the inferred conclusions. Linguistic interpretation of such outputs often involves the use of linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set based on the predefined primary terms, linguistic modifiers and linguistic connectives. More generally, linguistic approximation can be formalized in the terms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in ex plicitation (e.g. simple, modifier, composite, quantification and qualification rules) in com puting with words [Zadeh 1996]. However most existing methods of linguistic approximation use the simple, modifier and composite re-translation rules only. Although these methods can provide a sufficient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approximation of more complex ones that are typical in many practical applications of fuzzy systems may be less satisfactory. Therefore the question arises why not use in linguistic ap proximation also other re-translation rules corre sponding to the translation rules in explicitation to advantage. In particular linguistic quantifica tion may be desirable in situations where the conclusions interpreted as quantified linguistic propositions can be more informative and natu ral. This paper presents some aspects of linguis tic approximation in the context of the re translation rules and proposes an approach to linguistic approximation with the use of quantifi cation rules, i.e. quantified linguistic approxima tion. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation are considered with the use of lin guistic quantifiers based on the concepts of the non-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe extensive development of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic (e.g. [Zadeh 1973, Zadeh 1978, zadeh 1982, zadeh\n19871) has led to a general methodology proposed by zadeh [ladeh 1996], computing with words. In computing with words the objects of computing are words rather than numbers, with words playing the role of labels of infor mation granules. This methodology covers a wide range of applications of fuzzy systems including fuzzy decision support, decision making, optimization and fuzzy control (e.g. [Zadeh 1973, ladeh 19961). The foundations of computing with words lay in well known concepts in fuzzy logic such as a linguistic variable, proposition and granulation, fuzzy inference, fuzzy restrictions (con straints) and fuzzy constraint propagation (e.g. [Zadeh 1973, Zadeh 1975, zacteh 19781). In general computing with words involves three main steps [ladeh 1994, ladeh 1996]. The first step is explicitation of propositions ex pressed in a natural language, i.e. representation of the linguistic propositions in their canonical forms. It involves translation of linguistic propositions into the correspond ing possibility distributions performed according to the translation rules such as the simple, modifier, composi tion, qualification and quantification rules [zacteh 1973, Zadeh 1978, Zadeh 1996]. The second step involves rea soning about the propositions (fuzzy restriction propaga tion) with the use of the rules of inference in fuzzy logic. The output of this step is a conclusion in the form of a possibility distribution of a fuzzy set. The third step is re translation of the induced conclusion into a proposition expressed in a natural language, i.e. linguistic proposition. This step involves the use of linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set.\nMany methods of linguistic approximation have been de veloped and used in both fuzzy decision making [Bonis sane 1982, Eshragb and Mamdani 1981, Kowalczyk 1998] and fuzzy control [Novak 1995, Dvorak 1997]. These methods are usually based on combination of pre defined primary terms (e.g. small, medium, large), lin guistic modifiers or hedges (e.g. not, much, very, more or less) and their connectives (e.g. and, or) that form a lin guistic label assigned to a given fuzzy set. For example Bonissone [Bonissone 1982] has developed a linguistic approximation method based on feature extraction and pattern recognition techniques and used it in some prob lems of decision analysis and natural language processing. A more general approach to linguistic approximation has been proposed in [Eshragh and Mamdani 1981] that uses\n352 Kowalczyk\na combination of segments of the membership function\nwith well defined characteristics. The segments are la\nbeled with the use of linguistic modifiers of the generated\nprimitive terms and the final approximation is a combina\ntion of these labels. This technique has been demonstrated\nfor a decision making application [Eshragh and Mamdani\n1981]. Similar principles have been used in linguistic ap\nproximation presented in [Dvorak 1997] that considers\nonly linguistic terms entering the inference mechanism of\na linguistic fuzzy control system [Dvorak 1997, Novak 1995]. A linguistic approximation method based on the use of the principles of evolutionary computation where\nprimary terms, modifiers and connectives are treated as\nelements of a genetic program has been proposed in\n[Kowalczyk 1998].\nLinguistic approximation can be considered as a comple\nmentary task to explicitation and formalized in the terms\nof the re-translation rules that correspond to the transla\ntion rules in explicitation. However it should be noted that\nmost existing methods of linguistic approximation are\nbased on the simple, modifier and composite re-translation\nrules only. Although these methods can provide a suffi\ncient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approxima\ntion of more complex ones that are typical in many practi\ncal applications of fuzzy systems may be less satisfactory.\nTherefore the question arises why not use in linguistic\napproximation also other re-translation rules correspond\ning to the translation rules in explicitation to advantage. In\nparticular linguistic quantification may be desirable in\nsituations where the conclusions interpreted as quantified\nlinguistic propositions can be more informative and natu\nral. This paper presents some aspects of linguistic ap\nproximation in the context of the re-translation rules and\nproposes an approach to linguistic approximation with the\nuse of quantification rules, i.e. quantified linguistic ap\nproximation. The principles of re-translation rules in lin\nguistic approximation are presented in section 2. Section 3\nproposes two methods of quantified linguistic approxima\ntion with the use of linguistic quantifiers based on the\nconcepts of the non-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach. The concluding remarks are presented in section 4."

      "text" : "The fundamental concept used in fuzzy systems and more\ngenerally in computing with words is a linguistic proposi\ntion [Zadeh 1973, Zadeh 1978, Zadeh 1982, Zadeh 1987, Zadeh 1996]. A simple linguistic proposition takes the form \"X is A\" where X is a variable over the universe of discourse U and A is a linguistic value corresponding to a fuzzy subset of U defined by a membership function f.lA· The variable X has an associated possibility distribution. It\nis described by a possibility distribution function 7tx: U --7 [0, 1] that assigns a degree of possibility to every value of X. Translation of linguistic propositions into the corre sponding possibility distributions (i.e. explicitation) can\nbe performed according to well known translations rules\nin fuzzy set theory [Zadeh 1973, Zadeh 1978, Zadeh\n1982, Zadeh 1987, Zadeh 1996]. For example in a simple proposition the possibility distribution function of X is equal to the membership function of A, i.e.\nTranslation of more complex propositions (e.g. modified,\ncomposite, qualified and quantified propositions) involves\nthe use of translation rules such as modifier rules, compo\nsition rules, qualification rules and quantification rules\n[Zadeh 1973, Zadeh 1978, Zadeh 1982, Zadeh 1987,\nZadeh 1996]. Examples of the simple, modified and com\nposite linguistic propositions, and their corresponding\npossibility distributions are presented in figure 1.\nA complementary task to explicitation of linguistic propo sitions in computing with words is re-translation of in\nduced conclusions in the form of possibility distributions\ninto propositions expressed in a natural language, i.e. lin\nguistic propositions. It involves the use of linguistic ap\nproximation that assigns a linguistic label to a given fuzzy\nset.\nThe problem of linguistic approximation can be defined as mapping from a set S of fuzzy subsets in a universe of discourse U, into a set of labels L, which are generated according to a grammar G and a vocabulary V [Eshragh and Mamdani 1981]. Typically a solution of linguistic approximation is a linguistic description (label) LA corn posed of linguistic primary terms A, linguistic modifiers m and linguistic connectives c such that it is most suitable (meaningful) to describe a given fuzzy set (a possibility\ndistribution of a linguistic variable). For example a given possibility distribution of a fuzzy set X in figure I de scribing temperature may be linguistically approximated\nto \"Temperature is more/less medium or very large\", i.e. LA(X) =X is (m1 A1 c m2A2) where X= Temperature, m1 = more/less, A1 =medium, m2 =very, Az =large and c =or. It should be noted that the results of linguistic approxima tion are not unique and the quality of the provided solu tions depends on the error of the approximation expressed typically as the degree of equality of fuzzy quantities [Hi rota and Pedrycz 1991, Zwick 1998], i.e. the original fuzzy set and a fuzzy set corresponding to its linguistic approximation [ Kowalczyk 1998].\nTbe conunon characteristic of the existing linguistic ap proximation methods is that, although not stated explic itly, they generate labels following the principles similar to the translation rules in explicitation. In the context of linguistic approximation these principles can be sununa rized as the following re-translation rules:\n• Simple linguistic approximation Given the possibility distribution of a fuzzy set X, its linguistic approximation l.A(X) is a simple linguistic proposition as follows:\n1tx �,uA�l.A(X )=Xis A\nwhere 1t x is a possibility distribution function of X,\n,u A is a membership function of a linguistic term A,\nand � stands for the equality of fuzzy quantities.\n• Modified linguistic approximation The modifier rule asserts that re-translation of the pos sibility distribution function is expressed in the the following form:\nttx � ,umA �LA( X ) = X is mA\nwhere ,umA is a membership function of the modified\nlinguistic term A induced by the linguistic modifier m. In other words m can be interpreted as an operator that transforms the fuzzy set A into the fuzzy set mA. For example if m = very then .Uv,ryA (x) = ,U � (x).\n• Composite linguistic approximation Tbe composite re-translation rules apply to linguistic approximation with composite linguistic propositions which are generated from linguistic terms through the use of binary connectives c such as the conjunction (and) and the disjunction (or) as follows\nFor example if c is the conjunction then the composite re-translation rule states that if the possibility distribu tion of X is equal to the intersection of A and B, i.e.\nOn Quantified Linguistic Approximation 353\n,UAAB(x)= min(,uA (x),,us (x)) then a linguistic ap proximation of X can be expressed by a composite proposition \"X is A and B \". It should be noted that the composite re-translation rule can also be applied to more general cases where A and B are defined on two different universes of discourse. More specifically, let U and V be two universes of discourse, and let A and B be fuzzy subsets of U and V, respectively. Then two propositions \"X is A\" and \"Y is B\" connected by the conjunction can be expressed by a composite proposi tion \"X is A andY is B\" where the membership func tion is .UAAB (x, y) = min(,uA (x), .Us (y )) .\nTo illustrate the above re-translation rules let us consider two simple problems of linguistic approximation illus trated in figure 2. Tbe task is to assign linguistic labels to\ntwo different fuzzy sets XI and Xz with the use of the sim ple, modifier and composite re-translation rules and the following elements:\n• a set of primary terms T = {small, medium, large} • a set of linguistic modifiers M = {not, very, more/less,\nindeed, above, below} • a set of connectives C = {and, or}\nIt is easy to observe that both XI and X2 can be linguisti cally approximated with the same label, i.e. l.A(X1) = l.A(X2) = more /l ess medium or very large. To distinguish these linguistic approximations one can also provide some additional information expressing the quality of the ap proximation. There are many measures in fuzzy set theory that may serve the purpose of a measure of the linguistic approximation quality [Hirota and Pedrycz 1991, Yoshi kawa and Nishimura 1996, Zwick 1998]. Instances of some potential measures reflecting the difference of fuzzy sets in finite tmiverses that may be applicable in linguistic approximation are listed in table 1. It includes a measure of the height of a fuzzy set, complement of distance such\n354 Kowalczyk\nas a normalized Hamming distance, similarity measure and relative sigma count of two fuzzy sets, i.e. the original subnormal fuzzy set (or a segment) and the approximated linguistic label [Kowalczyk 1998]. The last column of the table presents the results of linguistic approximation for examples in figure 2 where the considered measures are applied to each segment of the approximated fuzzy set and the final linguistic approximation.\nIn general it can be observed that by providing an addi tional information about importance of segments and quality of linguistic approximation the approximation measures can enhance the meaning of the generated lin guistic labels. In all cases the approximation measures provide the results corresponding with our intuition and expectations. For example the measures in linguistic ap proximation of X1 indicate that a segment corresponding to the label \"more less medium\" dominates the segment \"very large\".\nHowever in some applications it may be desirable to pro vide more descriptive information about the generated linguistic labels. Following the observation of comple mentarity of linguistic approximation and explicitation, it seems that other re-translation rules can also be applied in linguistic approximation to advantage. In particular the quantified re-translation rules will be discussed in the next section.\n3 LINGUISTIC QUANTIFICATION IN LINGUISTIC APPROXIMATION\nQuantification is a common means for expressing the scope of propositions. It plays a central role in common sense knowledge representation and reasoning [Zadeh, 1982, Zadeh 1987]. The classical logic provides two types of quantification, i.e. universal and existential quantifica tion that correspond to the quantifiers all and some, re spectively. Fuzzy logic offers, in addition, a wide variety of fuzzy (linguistic) quantifiers such as few, several, usu ally, most. These quantifiers are interpreted in fuzzy logic as fuzzy numbers or fuzzy proportions [Zadeh 1982, Zadeh 1987].\nThe linguistic proposition in the form of X is A (where A can be modified and/or composite) implicitly indicates that it is true for all values of X , i.e. all X' s are A . How ever when only a proportion of values of X satisfies the proposition then the scope specification of this proportion with other quantifiers can be desirable. The quantification rules in explicitation define the translation of quantified linguistic propositions into the canonical forms suitable for further processing such as assessing the truth of a given linguistic proposition. In linguistic approximation quantification can be used to provide the scope of the lin guistic labels assigned to the approximated fuzzy set.\nIn general the quantification rule allows one to consider linguistic quantification in the proposition, i.e. \"QX is A\" where Q is a linguistic quantifier such as many, few, sev eral, all, some, most (e.g. many X's are large ) as illus trated in figure 3.\nReferring to the principles of the quantification rules in explicitation [Zadeh 1996], a quantified proposition can be generated in linguistic approximation of a given fuzzy set X with the following quantification re-translation rule:\nwhere J.lQ is a membership function of a fuzzy set corre sponding to the linguistic quantifier Q. Card(NX) denotes the number (or the proportion) of elements of X which are in A. In other words it can be considered as cardinality of a fuzzy set corresponding to the intersection of X and A. It is well known in fuzzy set theory that this cardinality can be expressed as a non-fuzzy or fuzzy number. More for mally, non-fuzzy cardinality of a fuzzy set F is typically defined as a sigma count as follows:\nN\nLCount(F)= LJ.lF(;) i=l\nwhere J.l F(;) is the grade of membership of the f' value of U in the fuzzy set F. It should be noted that when Q re-\nOn Quantified Linguistic Approximation 355\nlates to a proportion (e.g. most) then J.lQ is a mapping\nfrom [0,1] to [0,1], and so-called relative sigma count that expresses the proportion of elements of one fuzzy set X which are in another fuzzy set A can be defined as fol lows:\n'LCount(A! X)= 'LCount(AilX) !.Count( X)\nIt should be noted that the relative sigma count has been used in some linguistic approximation methods to measure the quality of approximation and to guide the matching process. In the presented approach its use is extended to quantification of the generated label with a linguistic quantifier. Let us consider two problems of linguistic ap proximation from the previous section (see figure 2) with the additional use of the quantified re-translation rule based on the non-fuzzy cardinality and a set of linguistic quantifiers Q = {none, almost none, some, few, most, al most all, all} as defined in figure 3. To ensure interpreta tion of the linguistic quantifiers the relative sigma count will be applied to the whole fuzzy set rather than its seg ments as described in the previous section. Table 2 pres ents some results of the quantified linguistic approxima tion for the selected linguistic labels. The linguistic quan tifiers are assigned to the labels on the basis of the relative sigma count, i.e. a linguistic quantifier with the highest compatibility degree for a given relative sigma count is selected. In this example it should be noted that all ele ments of the approximated fuzzy sets satisfy the compos ite label \"more or less medium or very large\" confirming the results of the standard linguistic approximation. In addition the components of such a label can be further described in the quantified linguistic approximation in the terms of linguistic quantification for both fuzzy sets as follows:\nLA!X1) =few X1 are more or less medium; few X1 are very large\n356 Kowalczyk\nLA(X2) =most X2 are more or less medium; few X2 are very large\nIt provides more informative description of these fuzzy sets. It should be noted that one can choose to consider more quantifiers to increase granularity of the possible descriptions. In addition a threshold can be included to eliminate linguistic quantifiers that do not satisfy the pro portion determined by the relative sigma count above a desired level.\nThe above interpretation allows one to assign a linguistic quantifier to a generated label during linguistic approxi mation. It should be noted however that the interpretation of linguistic quantifiers depends on the nature of the propositions considered. For example, if the propositions describe a number of objects then the quantifiers relate to a number (or proportion) of the elements of the approxi mated fuzzy set that satisfy the proposition (e.g. many cars are fast, most trucks are heavy, etc). In general, the use of such quantifiers implies the proposition Q}( 's are A's. In addition the linguistic quantifiers can also play a role of assessing the truth of a proposition. It can be re ferred to the so-called dispositional quantification with the use of the usual and typical values of a linguistic proposi tion [Zadeh 1978]. It is based on a concept of usuality of a proposition meaning that the proposition is usually true (e.g. usually Temperature is large). Such quantified propositions can be interpreted as linguistic propositions describing cardinality of a fuzzy set, e.g.\nusually (X is A)=l:Count(AI X ) is most\nTherefore quantified linguistic approximation can also be used with propositions in the form of QX is A.\nAlthough the non-fuzzy cardinality has commonly been used in explicitation the fuzzy cardinality may be more appropriate in linguistic approximation. In general the fuzzy cardinality of a fuzzy set A is expressed as a fuzzy number as it was proposed in [Zadeh 1982, Zadeh 1987]. More specifically, let Aa be the a.-level-set of A, i.e. non fuzzy set defined by\nAa = �,J,uA (u, )<'=a1 0> a<':l, u, E U, i = 1, . .. ,n\nwhere ,u, = ,u A (u, ), i = 1, . .. , n is the grade of membership of u1 in A . Then the fuzzy cardinality FECount(A) can be represented by intersection of two fuzzy numbers corre sponding to the fuzzy cardinalities FGCount(A) and FLCount(A) describing that at least n elements and at most n elements, respectively are in the fuzzy set A as follows:\nFECount(A)= FGCount(A)n FLCount(A)\nwhere\nFGCount(A)= L,.a!Count(Aa ) a\nFLCount(A)= L,.a I Count{A a ) a\nwhere :I: stands for the union, Count (Au.) denotes the car dinality of the non-fuzzy set Aa and A is the complement of the fuzzy set A. Similarly the relative fuzzy cardinalities of two fuzzy sets can be defined as follows:\nFECount(A! X )= FGCount(A! X )nFLCount(AI X )\nwhere\n� Count(A n X ) FGCount(A! X )= £..a/ a\n( ) a\na Count X,.\nThese cardinalities can be used in quantification of lin guistic propositions following the principles of the quanti fied re-translation rules as discussed before. The relative fuzzy cardinalities for the example of linguistic approxi mation of fuzzy sets X1 and X2 considered before are il lustrated in figures 4, 5 and 6. The final quantified lin guistic approximation of these sets is based on the as signment of linguistic quantifiers corresponding to the fuzzy cardinality FECount. The results confirm that all\n0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1\n0\nBCDF\n1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 E 0.5 0.4-}---\" 0.3 -l-----'i\"',_ 0.2\n0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 i---o#J\" 0.3 -l---1-:.....�.....,-�0.2 0.1\n0������������ c\nc'i><o c\":-\"' c<fr c'?\"' c'r- cfl' c<f c� c\"\\.\"' c'P c� c<!'

In addition, it should also be noted that assignment of a linguistic quantifier to the relative sigma count can be considered as another linguistic approximation problem. However it seems that in this case a simple matching pro vides sufficient approximation of linguistic quantification.\n4 CONCLUSIONS\nLinguistic approximation has been considered as a com plementary task to explicitation in computing with words and formalized in the terms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in explicitation. An approach to linguistic approximation with the use of quantification rules, i.e. quantified linguistic approxima tion has been proposed. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation based on the concepts of the non fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets have been pre sented and illustrated. Based on the initial results it can be concluded that linguistic quantification can be useful in linguistic approximation to enhance the interpretability of the generated linguistic labels. In particular it seems to be relevant in the problems where information about the scope of the linguistic labels assigned to the approximated fuzzy set is important. It includes commonsense knowl edge representation and reasoning in many applications of fuzzy systems for decision support, decision making, op\ntimization and control.\nReferences\nP.

    "abstractText" : "Most fuzzy systems including fuzzy decision support and fuzzy control systems provide out­ puts in the form of fuzzy sets that represent the inferred conclusions. Linguistic interpretation of such outputs often involves the use of linguistic approximation that assigns a linguistic label to a fuzzy set based on the predefined primary terms, linguistic modifiers and linguistic connectives. More generally, linguistic approximation can be formalized in the terms of the re-translation rules that correspond to the translation rules in ex­ plicitation (e.g. simple, modifier, composite, quantification and qualification rules) in com­ puting with words [Zadeh 1996]. However most existing methods of linguistic approximation use the simple, modifier and composite re-translation rules only. Although these methods can provide a sufficient approximation of simple fuzzy sets the approximation of more complex ones that are typical in many practical applications of fuzzy systems may be less satisfactory. Therefore the question arises why not use in linguistic ap­ proximation also other re-translation rules corre­ sponding to the translation rules in explicitation to advantage. In particular linguistic quantifica­ tion may be desirable in situations where the conclusions interpreted as quantified linguistic propositions can be more informative and natu­ ral. This paper presents some aspects of linguis­ tic approximation in the context of the re­ translation rules and proposes an approach to linguistic approximation with the use of quantifi­ cation rules, i.e. quantified linguistic approxima­ tion. Two methods of the quantified linguistic approximation are considered with the use of lin­ guistic quantifiers based on the concepts of the non-fuzzy and fuzzy cardinalities of fuzzy sets. A number of examples are provided to illustrate the proposed approach.",
