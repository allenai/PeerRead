      "text" : "Over the past several years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly boosted the state-of-the-art performance in many visual classification tasks such as object recognition, (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Sermanet et al., 2014; He et al., 2015b;a), face verification (Taigman et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2014; 2015) and hand-written digit recognition (Wan et al., 2013). The layered learning architecture, together with convolution and pooling which carefully extract features from local to global, renders the strong visual representation ability of CNNs as well as their current significant positions in large-scale visual recognition tasks.\nProceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016.

Standard CNNs can be viewed as convolutional feature learning machines that are supervised by the softmax loss.\nFacing the increasingly more complex data, CNNs have been continuously improved with deeper structures (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2015), smaller strides (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and new non-linear activations (Goodfellow et al., 2013; Nair & Hinton, 2010; He et al., 2015b). While benefiting from the strong learning ability, CNNs also have to face the crucial issue of overfilling. Considerable effort such as large-scale training data (Russakovsky et al., 2014), dropout (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), data augmentation (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015), regularization (Hinton et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014; Wan et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2013) and stochastic pooling (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013) has been put to address the issue.\nA recent trend towards learning with even stronger features is to reinforce CNNs with more discriminative information. Intuitively, the learned features are good if their intra-class compactness and inter-class separability are simultaneously maximized. While this may not be easy due to the inherent large intra-class variations in many tasks, the strong representation ability of CNNs make it possible to learn invariant features towards this direction. Inspired by such idea, the contrastive loss (Hadsell et al., 2006) and triplet loss (Schroff et al., 2015) were proposed to enforce extra intra-class compactness and inter-class separa-\n†Equal contribution. ?Corresponding author.\nar X\niv :1\n61 2.\n02 29\n5v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n7 D\nec 2\nbility. A consequent problem, however, is that the number of training pairs and triplets can theoretically go up to O(N2) where N is the total number of training samples. Considering that CNNs often handle large-scale training sets, a subset of training samples need to be carefully selected for these losses. The softmax function is widely adopted by many CNNs (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; He et al., 2015a;b) due to its simplicity and probabilistic interpretation. Together with the cross-entropy loss, they form arguably one of the most commonly used components in CNN architectures. In this paper, we define the softmax loss as the combination of a cross-entropy loss, a softmax function and the last fully connected layer (see Fig. 1). Under such definition, many prevailing CNN models can be viewed as the combination of a convolutional feature learning component and a softmax loss component, as shown in Fig. 1. Despite its popularity, current softmax loss does not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and inter-class-separability. Our key intuition is that the separability between sample and parameter can be factorized into amplitude ones and angular ones with cosine similarity: Wcx = ‖Wc‖2‖x‖2 cos(θc), where c is the class index, and the corresponding parameters Wc of the last fully connected layer can be regarded as the linear classifier of class c. Under softmax loss, the label prediction decision rule is largely determined by the angular similarity to each class since softmax loss uses cosine distance as classification score. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to generalize the softmax loss to a more general large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss in terms of angular similarity, leading to potentially larger angular separability between learned features. This is done by incorporating a\npreset constantmmultiplying with the angle between sample and the classifier of ground truth class. m determines the strength of getting closer to the ground truth class, producing an angular margin. One shall see, the conventional softmax loss becomes a special case of the L-Softmax loss under our proposed framework. Our idea is verified by Fig. 2 where the learned features by L-Softmax become much more compact and well separated.\nThe L-Softmax loss is a flexible learning objective with adjustable inter-class angular margin constraint. It presents a learning task of adjustable difficulty where the difficulty gradually increases as the required margin becomes larger. The L-Softmax loss has several desirable advantages. First, it encourages angular decision margin between classes, generating more discriminative features. Its geometric interpretation is very clear and intuitive, as elaborated in Section 3.2. Second, it partially avoids overfitting by defining a more difficult learning target, casting a different viewpoint to the overfitting problem. Third, L-Softmax not only benefits classification tasks but also benefits verification tasks. Taking face verification as an example, the task is to determine whether two given testing faces belong to the same person. Ideal features for verification requires the minimal inter-class distance to be greater than the maximal intra-class distance. While conventional softmax loss does not perform well, the proposed L-Softmax loss can significantly improve the performance on this tasks.\nOur experiments validate that L-Softmax can effectively boost the performance in both classification and verification tasks. More intuitively, the visualizations of the learned features in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 show great discrimina-\ntiveness of the L-Softmax loss. Besides performance, the L-Softmax loss is also well motivated with clear geometric interpretation as elaborated in Section 3.3."

      "text" : "Current widely used data loss functions in CNNs include Euclidean loss, (square) hinge loss, information gain loss, contrastive loss, triplet loss, Softmax loss, etc. To enhance the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, (Sun et al., 2014) trains the CNN with the combination of softmax loss and contrastive loss. The contrastive loss inputs the CNNs with pairs of training samples. If the input pair belongs to the same class, the contrastive loss will require their features are as similar as possible. Otherwise, the contrastive loss will require their distance larger than a margin. (Schroff et al., 2015) uses the triplet loss to encourage a distance constraint similar to the contrastive loss. Differently, the triplet loss requires 3 (or a multiple of 3) training samples as input at a time. The triplet loss minimizes the distance between an anchor sample and a positive sample (of the same identity), and maximizes the distance between the anchor sample and a negative sample (of different identity). Both triplet loss and contrastive loss require a carefully designed pair selection procedure. Both (Sun et al., 2014) and (Schroff et al., 2015) suggest that enforcing such a distance constraint that encourages intraclass compactness and inter-class separability can greatly boost the feature discriminativeness, which motivates us to employ a margin constraint in the original softmax loss.\nUnlike any previous work, our work cast a novel view on generalizing the original softmax loss. We define the i-th input feature xi with the label yi. Then the original softmax loss can be written as\nL = 1\nN ∑ i Li = 1 N ∑ i\n− log (\nefyi∑ j e fj\n) (1)\nwhere fj denotes the j-th element (j ∈ [1,K], K is the number of classes) of the vector of class scores f , and N is the number of training data. In the softmax loss, f is usually the activations of a fully connected layer W , so fyi can be written as fyi = W T yixi in which Wyi is the yi-th column of W . Note that, we omit the constant b in fj ,∀j here to simplify analysis, but our L-Softmax loss can still be easily modified to work with b (In fact, the performance is nearly of no difference, so we do not make it complicated here.). Because fj is the inner product between Wj and xi, it can be also formulated as fj = ‖Wj‖‖xi‖ cos(θj) where θi (0 ≤ θj ≤ π) is the angle between the vector Wj and xi. Thus the loss becomes\nLi = − log (\ne‖Wyi‖‖xi‖ cos(θyi )∑ j e ‖Wj‖‖xi‖ cos(θj)\n) (2)"

The original softmax is to force W T1 x > W T 2 x (i.e. ‖W1‖‖x‖ cos(θ1) > ‖W2‖‖x‖ cos(θ2)) in order to classify x correctly. However, we want to make the classification more rigorous in order to produce a decision margin. So we instead require ‖W1‖‖x‖ cos(mθ1) > ‖W2‖‖x‖ cos(θ2) (0 ≤ θ1 ≤ πm ) where m is a positive integer. Because the following inequality holds:\n‖W1‖‖x‖ cos(θ1) ≥ ‖W1‖‖x‖ cos(mθ1) > ‖W2‖‖x‖ cos(θ2).\n(3)\nTherefore, ‖W1‖‖x‖ cos(θ1) > ‖W2‖‖x‖ cos(θ2) has to hold. So the new classification criteria is a stronger requirement to correctly classify x, producing a more rigorous decision boundary for class 1."

With larger m, the classification margin becomes larger and the learning objective also becomes harder. Meanwhile, D(θ) is required to be a monotonically decreasing function and D( πm ) should equal cos( π m ).\nTo simplify the forward and backward propagation, we construct a specific ψ(θi) in this paper:\nψ(θ) = (−1)k cos(mθ)− 2k, θ ∈ [kπ m , (k + 1)π m ] (6)\nwhere k ∈ [0,m − 1] and k is an integer.

      "heading" : "3.3. Geometric Interpretation",
      "text" : "We aim to encourage aa angle margin between classes via the L-Softmax loss. To simplify the geometric interpretation, we analyze the binary classification case where there are only W1 and W2.\nFirst, we consider the ‖W1‖ = ‖W2‖ scenario as shown in Fig. 4. With ‖W1‖ = ‖W2‖, the classification result depends entirely on the angles between x and W1(W2). In the training stage, the original softmax loss requires θ1 < θ2 to classify the sample x as class 1, while the L-Softmax loss requires mθ1 < θ2 to make the same decision. We can see the L-Softmax loss is more rigor about the classification criteria, which leads to a classification margin between class 1 and class 2. If we assume both softmax loss and L-Softmax loss are optimized to the same value\nand all training features can be perfectly classified, then the angle margin between class 1 and class 2 is given by m−1 m+1θ1,2 where θ1,2 is the angle between classifier vector W1 and W2. The L-Softmax loss also makes the decision boundaries for class 1 and class 2 different as shown in Fig 4, while originally the decision boundaries are the same. From another viewpoint, we let θ′1 = mθ1 and assume that both the original softmax loss and the L-Softmax loss can be optimized to the same value. Then we can know θ′1 in the original softmax loss ism−1 times larger than θ1 in the L-Softmax loss. As a result, the angle between the learned feature and W1 will become smaller. For every class, the same conclusion holds. In essence, the L-Softmax loss narrows the feasible angle1 for every class and produces an angle margin between these classes.\nFor both the ‖W1‖ > ‖W2‖ and ‖W1‖ < ‖W2‖ scenarios, the geometric interpretation is a bit more complicated. Because the length of W1 and W2 is different, the feasible angles of class 1 and class 2 are also different (see the decision boundary of original softmax loss in Fig. 4). Normally, the larger Wj is, the larger the feasible angle of its corresponding class is. As a result, the L-Softmax loss also produces different feasible angles for different classes. Similar to the analysis of the ‖W1‖ = ‖W2‖ scenario, the proposed loss will also generate a decision margin between class 1 and class 2."

In visual classification, we use three standard benchmark datasets: MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998), CIFAR10 (Krizhevsky, 2009), and CIFAR100 (Krizhevsky, 2009). In face verification, we evaluate our method on the widely used LFW dataset (Huang et al., 2007). We only use a single model in all baseline CNNs to compare our performance. For convenience, we use L-Softmax to denote the L-Softmax loss. Both Softmax and L-Softmax in the experiments use the same CNN shown in Table 1.\nGeneral Settings: We follow the design philosophy of VGG-net (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) in two aspects: (1) for convolution layers, the kernel size is 3×3 and 1 padding (if not specified) to keep the feature map unchanged. (2) for pooling layers, if the feature map size is halved, the number of filters is doubled in order to preserve the time complexity per layer. Our CNN architectures are described in Table 1. In convolution layers, the stride is set to 1 if not specified. We implement the CNNs using the Caffe library (Jia et al., 2014) with our modifications.

However, when training data has too many subjects (such as CASIA-WebFace dataset), the convergence of L-Softmax will be more difficult than softmax loss. For those cases that L-Softmax has difficulty converging, we use a learning strategy by letting fyi = λ‖Wyi‖‖xi‖ cos(θyi )+‖Wyi‖‖xi‖ψ(θyi ) 1+λ and start the gradient descent with a very large λ (it is similar to optimize the original softmax).

For the data augmentation experiment, we follow the standard data augmentation in (Lee et al., 2015) for training: 4 pixels are padded on each side, and a 32×32 crop is randomly sampled from the padded image or its horizontal flip. In testing, we only evaluate the single view of the original 32×32 image. The results are shown in Table 3.

Fig. 7 shows the relation between the error rate and the iteration number with different number of filters in the L-Softmax loss (m=4). We use four different CNN architecture to optimize the L-Softmax loss with m = 4, and then plot their training and testing error rate. These four CNN architectures have the same structure and only differ in the number of filters\n(e.g. 32/32/64/128 denotes that there are 32, 32, 64 and 128 filters in every convolution layer of Conv0.x, Conv1.x Conv2.x and Conv3.x, respectively). On both the training set and testing set, the L-Softmax loss with larger number of filters performs better than those with smaller number of filters, indicating L-Softmax loss does not easily suffer from overfitting. The results also show that our L-Softmax loss can be optimized easily. Therefore, one can learn that the L-Softmax loss can make full use of the stronger learning ability of CNNs, since stronger learning ability leads to performance gain."

The extensive experimental results on severak benchmark datasets show clear advantages over current state-of-\nthe-art CNNs and all the compared baselines."

    "abstractText" : "Cross-entropy loss together with softmax is arguably one of the most common used supervision components in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite its simplicity, popularity and excellent performance, the component does not explicitly encourage discriminative learning of features. In this paper, we propose a generalized large-margin softmax (L-Softmax) loss which explicitly encourages intra-class compactness and inter-class separability between learned features. Moreover, L-Softmax not only can adjust the desired margin but also can avoid overfitting. We also show that the L-Softmax loss can be optimized by typical stochastic gradient descent. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the deeply-learned features with L-softmax loss become more discriminative, hence significantly boosting the performance on a variety of visual classification and verification tasks.",
