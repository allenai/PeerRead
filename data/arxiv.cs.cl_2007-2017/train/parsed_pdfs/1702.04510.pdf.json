      "text" : "In a machine translation (MT) system, determining the correct word order of translated words is crucial as word order reflects meaning. As different languages have different ordering of words, reordering of words is required to produce the correct translation output. Reordering in MT remains a major challenge for language pairs with a significant word order difference. Phrase-based MT systems (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003), which achieve state-of-the-art performance, generally adopt a reordering model based on the span of a phrase and the span of its adjacent phrase (Tillmann 2004; Koehn et al. 2005; Galley and Manning 2008).\nIncorporating the dependency parse tree of an input (source) sentence is beneficial for reordering, as the dependency tree captures the relationships between words in a sentence, through the dependency relation label between two words. The dependency parse tree of a source sentence can be utilized in reordering integrated within phrasebased statistical MT (SMT), by defining dependency-based features in the SMT log-linear model (Chang et al. 2009; Hadiwinoto, Liu, and Ng 2016).\nRecently, neural networks have been applied to natural language processing (NLP) to minimize feature engineering and to utilize continuous word representation.

Nevertheless, reordering integrated with translation has not benefited from the neural approach.\nIn this paper, we propose applying a neural network (NN) model in reordering integrated within translation. We apply our neural classifier on two words linked by a dependency relation link, either a head-child or sibling link, in order to predict if two words need to be swapped in the translation. The prediction is used to guide the decoding process of stateof-the-art phrase-based SMT."

      "text" : "As shown in Figure 1a, the classifier is a feed-forward neural network whose input layer contains the features. Each feature is mapped by a lookup table to a continuous vector representation, and the resulting vectors are concatenated and fed into (multiplied by) a series of hidden lay-\ners (weight matrices) using the rectified linear activation function, relu(x) = max(0, x). Given the hidden-layertransformed embedding vector x, a weight vector W, and a bias value b, the prediction output σ is defined as:\nz = W · x+ b (1)\nσ(z) = 1\n1 + e−z (2)\nWe initialize the hidden layers and the embedding layer for non-word features (POS tags, dependency labels, and Boolean indicators) by a random uniform distribution. For word features xh, xc, xl, and xr, we initialize their embeddings by the dependency-driven embedding scheme of (Bansal, Gimpel, and Livescu 2014). This scheme is a modified skip-gram model, which given an input word, predicts its context (surrounding words), resulting in a mapping such that words with similar surrounding words have similar continuous vector representations (Mikolov et al. 2013). Similarly, defining the dependency information (i.e., label, head word, and child word) as context produces a mapping such that words with similar head and child words have similar continuous vector representations.\nDependency-driven embedding can be obtained from a dependency-parsed corpus, where each training instance is formulated as (note: xg is the head of xh):\nL(xh)<GL> xg<G> xh xc L(xc)<L> The skip-gram model is trained with a window size of 1 (denoting one context item on the left and one on the right).\nFollowing (Bansal, Gimpel, and Livescu 2014), the items marked by <> subscripts serve as the context, have different continuous vector representations from the words (xh and xc), and are filtered out from the embedding vocabulary after training."

      "text" : "We adopt the phrase-based SMT approach, using a beam search decoding algorithm (Koehn 2004a). Each source phrase and one of its possible translations represent an alternative in the search for the translated sentence. While the search produces translation from left to right in the translation output order, it picks the source phrases in any order to enable reordering for a language pair with different word order. The translation output is picked based on a score computed by a log-linear model, comprising the weighted sum of feature function values (Och and Ney 2002).\nA phrase-based SMT system typically includes a distance-based reordering penalty (DBR) (Koehn, Och, and Marcu 2003), to discourage long-distance reordering, and phrase-based reordering models (PBRM). The latter comprises the phrase-based lexicalized reordering (PBLR) model (Tillmann 2004; Koehn et al. 2005) and the hierarchical reordering (HR) model (Galley and Manning 2008). These models are the conventional reordering models widely used in phrase-based SMT."

      "text" : "Phrase-based decoding can take into account the source dependency parse tree to guide its search. To encourage structural cohesion during translation, we add a dependency distortion penalty (DDP) feature (Cherry 2008) to discourage translation output in which the translated words of a phrase in a source dependency parse subtree are split.\nWe also incorporate the sparse dependency swap (DS) features of our prior work (Hadiwinoto, Liu, and Ng 2016).\nThe features involve considering a source word x being translated during beam search and each of the as yet untranslated source words x′, where x′ is the head, the child, or the sibling of x in the source dependency parse tree. x′ can be on the left of x in the source sentence, resulting in x and x′ being swapped in the translation output; or x′ can be on the right of x, resulting in x and x′ following the same order (in order). This principle is used to guide word pair translation ordering through sparse feature templates for head-child word pair and sibling word pair, in which each word x in a word pair is represented by its dependency label (L(x)), POS tag (T (x)), and their combination.\nSpecifically, the sparse dependency swap (DS) features of (Hadiwinoto, Liu, and Ng 2016) are based on a feature template for a head word xh and its child word xc, their dependency labels and POS tags, whether xh is on the p ∈ {left, right} of xc in the source sentence, and the ordering of the pair in the translation output o ∈ {in order, swapped}:\nHhc(xh, xc, p, o) =  hhc(L(xh), L(xc), p, o)hhc(T (xh), T (xc), p, o)hhc(L(xh), T (xc), p, o) hhc(T (xh), L(xc), p, o)  (4) Similarly, there is another feature template for two sibling words, xl on the left of xr sharing a common head word, their dependency labels and POS tags, and the ordering of the pair in the translation output o ∈ {in order, swapped}:\nHsib(xl, xr, o) =  hsib(L(xl), L(xr), o)hsib(T (xl), T (xr), o)hsib(L(xl), T (xr), o) hsib(T (xl), L(xr), o)  (5)"

To reduce the possibility of alignment errors, parallel sentences in the corpora that are longer than 85 words in either Chinese (after word segmentation) or English are discarded. In the end, the final parallel texts consist of about 8.8M sentence pairs, 228M Chinese tokens, and 254M English tokens (a token can be a word or punctuation symbol). We also added two dictionaries3, having 1.81M Chinese tokens and 2.03M English tokens in total, by concatenating them to our training parallel texts. To train the Chinese word embeddings as described above, we concatenate the Chinese side of our parallel texts with Chinese Gigaword version 5 (LDC2011T13), resulting in 2.08B words in total.\nAll Chinese sentences in our experiment are first wordsegmented using a maximum entropy-based Chinese word segmenter (Low, Ng, and Guo 2005) trained on the Chinese Treebank (CTB) segmentation standard. Then the parallel corpus is word-aligned by GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) using IBM Models 1, 3, and 4 (Brown et al. 1993)4. For building the phrase table, which follows word alignment, the maximum length of a phrase is set to 7 words for both the source and target sides.\nThe language model (LM) is a 5-gram model trained on the English side of the FBIS parallel corpus (LDC2003E14) and the monolingual corpus English Gigaword version 4 (LDC2009T13), consisting of 107M sentences and 3.8B tokens altogether. Each individual Gigaword sub-corpus5 is used to train a separate language model and so is the English side of FBIS. These individual language models are then interpolated to build one single large LM, via perplexity tuning on the development set.\nTraining the neural reordering classifier involves LDC manually-aligned corpora, from which we extracted 572K head-child pairs and 1M sibling pairs as training instances6, while retaining 90,233 head-child pairs and 146,112 sibling pairs as held-out tuning instances7. The latter is used to pick the best neural network parameters.\nOur translation development set is MTC corpus version 1 (LDC2002T01) and version 3 (LDC2004T07). This development set has 1,928 sentence pairs in total, 49K Chinese tokens and 58K English tokens on average across the four reference translations. Weight tuning is done by using the pairwise ranked optimization (PRO) algorithm (Hopkins and May 2011).\nWe parse the Chinese sentences by the Mate parser, which jointly performs POS tagging and dependency parsing (Bohnet and Nivre 2012), trained on Chinese Treebank (CTB) version 8.0 (LDC2013T21).\nOur translation test set consists of the NIST MT evaluation sets from 2002 to 2006, and 20088.\n3LDC2002L27 and LDC2005T34. 4The default when running GIZA++ with Moses. 5AFP, APW, CNA, LTW, NYT, and Xinhua 6LDC2012T20, LDC2012T24, LDC2013T05, LDC2013T23, LDC2014T25, LDC2015T04, and LDC2015T18. 7LDC2012T16. 8LDC2010T10, LDC2010T11, LDC2010T12, LDC2010T14,"

Statistical significance testing between systems is conducted by bootstrap resampling (Koehn 2004b).\nTable 1 shows the experimental results. The distortion limit of all the systems is set to 14. As shown in the table, when the word embedding features are initialized using dependency context (Bansal, Gimpel, and Livescu 2014), which is our default scheme, our translation system with single neural classifier is able to improve over our strong baseline system (DBR+PBRM+DDP+DS) by +0.32 BLEU point, while an ensemble model of 10 neural classifiers improves over our baseline system by +0.57 BLEU point. The results show that the neural reordering classifier is able to replace the sparse dependency swap features and achieves better performance.\nIn addition to the dependency-driven embedding initialization scheme of (Bansal, Gimpel, and Livescu 2014), we are also interested in testing other word embedding schemes. Additional experiments use two other initialization schemes: (1) random initialization and (2) the original skip-gram model of (Mikolov et al. 2013) with a window size of 5.\nLDC2010T17, and LDC2010T21. 9ftp://jaguar.ncsl.nist.gov/mt/resources/ mteval-v11b.pl\nAs shown in Table 1, using dependency-driven embedding initialization scheme yields the best improvement over our baseline. On the other hand, random initialization of word embedding yields worse results compared to our baseline, showing a significant drop. Using the skip-gram word embedding model yields average results comparable to the baseline.\nWe are also interested in testing the performance of the dependency-based reordering features in the absence of the conventional phrase-based reordering models. Table 1 shows that the system with dependency distortion penalty (DDP) and sparse dependency swap (DS) features is unable to outperform the system with only conventional phrasebased reordering models (DBR+PBRM). However, our neural classifier approach, without the conventional reordering models, significantly outperforms the conventional reordering models by +1.05 BLEU point."

      "heading" : "Discussion",
      "text" : "Dependency swap features capture the dependency label and POS tag of the two words to be reordered, but not the actual words themselves. While using words as sparse features may result in too many parameters, the continuous word representation in our neural approach alleviates this problem. In addition, the neural network model also learns useful combinations of individual features. While dependency swap features (Hadiwinoto, Liu, and Ng 2016) define features as pairs of dependency label and POS tag, the hidden layer of a NN can dynamically choose the information to take into account for the reordering decision.\nUsing neural classifiers with dependency-based word embedding initialization yields significant improvement, whereas random initialization and skip-gram initialization of word embeddings yield no improvement. This shows the importance of capturing dependency information in the word\nembeddings for reordering. Figure 2 shows the baseline phrase-based SMT system with conventional phrase-based reordering models (DBR+PBRM) and sparse dependency swap features produces an incorrect translation output. The sparse dependency swap features prefer the Chinese words “zhiyi (one of)” and “zuzhi (organization)”, where “zhiyi” is the head word of “zuzhi”, to remain in order after translation, based on their dependency labels and POS tags. However, the Chinese expression “NOUN zhiyi” should be swapped in the English translation, resulting in “one of NOUN”10.\nOur experimental results also show that without conventional phrase-based reordering models, the sparse dependency-based features are unable to outperform the conventional reordering models, whereas the neural dependency-based reordering model outperforms the conventional reordering models. This further demonstrates the strength of our dependency-based neural reordering approach.\nOur approach applies syntax to SMT with beam search decoding. This is different from prior approaches requiring chart parsing decoding such as the hierarchical phrasebased (Chiang 2007), tree-to-string (Liu, Liu, and Lin 2006), string-to-tree (Marcu et al. 2006), and tree-to-tree (Zhai et al. 2011) SMT approaches.\nThe end-to-end neural MT (NMT) approach has recently been proposed for MT. However, the most recent NMT papers tested on the same NIST Chinese-to-English test sets (Wang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016) show lower absolute BLEU scores (by 2 to 7 points) compared to our scores. Following the approach of (Junczys-Dowmunt, Dwojak, and\n10The ordering is further aggravated by wrongly swapping “ISO” and “zuzhi (organization)”, due to the translation output score being the weighted sum of features including LM, which prefers such a translation.\nHoang 2016), our own implemented NMT system (single system without ensemble), when trained on the same corpora and tested on the same NIST test sets in this paper, achieves an average BLEU score of 38.97, lower by 0.58 point compared to our best SMT system (p < 0.01). This shows that our neural dependency-based reordering model outperforms the NMT approach. NMT also requires longer time to train (18 days) compared to our best SMT system (3 days)."

      "heading" : "Related Work",
      "text" : "Phrase-based SMT reordering can utilize the dependency parse of the input sentence. Chang et al. (2009) utilized the traversed paths of dependency labels to guide phrase reordering. Hadiwinoto, Liu, and Ng (2016) introduced a technique to determine the order of two translated words with corresponding source words that are related through the dependency parse during beam search. They defined sparse decoding features to encourage or penalize the reordering of two words, based on the POS tag and dependency relation label of each word, but not the words themselves.\nNeural reordering models have been applied to re-rank translation candidates generated by the translation decoder. Li et al. (2014) introduced a recursive auto-encoder model to represent phrases and determine the phrase orientation probability. Cui, Wang, and Li (2016) introduced long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to predict the translation word orientation probability. These approaches did not use dependency parse and they were not applied directly during decoding.\nSource dependency parse is also used in the pre-ordering approach, which pre-orders words in a source sentence into target word order and then translates the target-ordered source sentence into the target language. While the preordering step typically utilizes a classifier with feature combinations (Lerner and Petrov 2013; Jehl et al. 2014), a neural network can replace the classifier to avoid feature combination. De Gispert, Iglesias, and Byrne (2015) introduced a feed-forward neural network to pre-order the de-\npendency parse tree nodes (words). However, they did not explore dependency-driven embeddings and model ensemble. Miceli-Barone and Attardi (2015) treat pre-ordering as a traversal on the dependency parse tree, guided by a recurrent neural network. In these approaches, the translation possibility is limited to one target ordering. In contrast, applying a neural reordering model jointly with beam search allows for multiple ordering alternatives and interaction with other models, such as the phrase-based reordering models. We can even build multiple neural models (ensemble) and assign a different weight to each of them to optimize translation quality.\nOur neural reordering classifier serves as a decoding feature function in SMT, leveraging the decoding. This is similar to prior work on neural decoding features, i.e., neural language model (Vaswani et al. 2013) and neural joint model (Devlin et al. 2014), a source-augmented language model. However, these features are not about word reordering.\nWhile continuous representation of words is originally defined for words (Mikolov et al. 2013), we also define continuous representation for POS tags, dependency labels, and indicator features. Extending continuous representation to non-word features is also done in neural dependency parsing (Chen and Manning 2014; Andor et al. 2016), which shows better performance by using continuous feature representation over the traditional discrete representation."

The dependency parse tree of a source sentence can help to determine the correct word order of the translated words. In this paper, we present a novel reordering approach utilizing a neural network and dependency-based embeddings to predict whether the translations of two source words linked by a dependency relation should remain in the same order or should be swapped in the translated sentence. Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show that our approach yields a statistically significant improvement of 0.57 BLEU point on benchmark NIST test sets, compared to our prior state-of-theart statistical MT system that uses sparse dependency-based reordering features.",
