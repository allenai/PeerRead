      "text" : "With the rapid growth of digital music libraries as well as advancements in technology, music classification and recommendation has gained increased popularity in the music industry and among listeners. Many applications using machine learning algorithms have been developed to categorize music by instruments [10, 18] artist similarity [14, 23], emotion [16, 13, 27], or genre [25, 15]. Psychological studies have shown that listening to music is one of the most popular activities in leisure time and that it has an enhancing effect on the social cohesion, emotional state, and mood of the listeners [22, 28]. The increasing number of song lyrics that are freely available on the Internet allow the effective training of machine learning algorithms to perform mood prediction and filtering for music that can be associated with positive or negative emotions. The aim of this project was to build a recommendation system that is able to predict whether a song is happy or sad, which can be applied to song databases in order to select music by sentiment in different social contexts (Figure 1). The main contributions of this project are as follows:\n1. Creation of a new dataset that can provide the basis of future studies on music and mood.\n2. A naive Bayes classification model for mood prediction of music based on lyrics analysis.\n3. An online web application to perform music mood pre-diction given artist name and song title.\nSection 2 provides a formal statement of the problem and related work. Section 3 summarizes the preprocessing and data mining steps that were conducted in this project. The experimental setup and results we obtained are presented and discussed in section 4, and the conclusions and future directions are provided in section 5.\nThe primary goal of this project was to build a classification model to filter for happy music with high precision. A naive Bayes model was chosen for the lyric classification since naive Bayes classifiers are known to perform well given small sample sizes [6] and are successfully being used for similar binary text classification tasks such as e-mail spam detection [21]. Furthermore, empirical studies\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n00 13\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nN ov\nhave shown that the performance of naive Bayes classifiers for text categorization is comparable to Support Vector machines [9, 7], while being computationally more efficient for batch and on-line learning.\nThe availability of open-source music datasets for research is either limited to audio feature datasets or requires manual retrieval from on-line music platforms of Creative Commons-licensed music or public domain recordings. A widely used dataset for music information retrieval (MIR) research is the freely-available Million Song Dataset [3] that contains audio features and metadata of a million music tracks. The musiXmatch [4] dataset provides lyrics in a bag of words [8] format for 77% of the songs in the Million Song Dataset after application of a stemming algorithm.\nWhile ground truth genre labels can usually be determined unambiguously through rational analysis, labeling of music by mood is a more challenging task. The perception of mood and the association of mood with different types of music are obviously subjective works. Applications of crowdsourcing approaches to collect mood ratings in Arousal-Valence (A-V) space have been designed [24], and other music mood datasets are available [21] as well; however, datasets that are providing ground truth mood labels for music are typically covering very vast and diverse sets of mood labels, which cannot be transferred to a binary categorization into happy and sad in an unambiguous manner."

      "text" : "A random subsample of 10,000 songs was downloaded from the Million Song Dataset [3] in HDF5 format. Using the provided song title and artist information from these HDF5 files, custom code was written to download the corresponding lyrics from LyricWikia [2]. Songs for which lyrics were not available — songs that are either instrumental or not deposited in the LyricWikia database — were removed from the dataset. The choice of acquiring the lyrics in an unprocessed format over the musiXmatch dataset was necessary for comparing different feature extraction and preprocessing steps. Custom code based on the Python NLTK library [5] was written to identify non-English lyrics and remove these songs from the dataset using majority support based on the counts of English words vs. non-English words in the lyrics. After applying those filtering rules, the remaining dataset of 2,773 songs was randomly partitioned into a training dataset (1,000 songs) and a validation dataset (200 songs). Music labels were automatically collected from user-provided content on the music database Last.fm [1]. However, due to the nonexistence of mood-related tags for a majority of songs in the filtered dataset, the two mood labels (happy and sad) were manually assigned based on human interpretation of the lyrics and listening tests. Happy music was defined as music that could be\nassociated with upbeat sounds and positive themes. Sad music was defined as music that the author related to a negative, dark, or violent theme."

      "text" : "Prior to the tokenization of the lyrics, a bag of words model [8] (a fixed-size multiset where the order of words has no significance) was used to transform the lyrics into feature vectors. Further processing of the feature vectors include the choice of different n-gram sequences (n ∈ {1, 2, 3}), stop word removal based on a stop word list from the Python NLTK library [5], and usage of the Porter stemming algorithm [20] for suffix stripping. Also, different representations of the word count in the feature vectors for each song text were used, such as binarization, term frequency (tf ) computation, and term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf ) computation.\nThe term frequency-inverse document frequency was calculated based on the normalized term frequency tf-idf(t, d), which is computed as the number of occurrences of a term t in a song text d divided by the total number of lyrics that contain term t\ntf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d)× idf(t). (1)\nLet tf-idf(t, d) be the normalized term frequency and idf(t) be the inverse document frequency\nidf(t) = log 1 + nd\n1 + df(d, t) + 1,\nwhere nd is the total number of lyrics and df(d, t) the number of lyrics that contain the term t."

The model selection was performed via grid search and 10-fold cross- validation on the 1000-song training dataset to optimize the performance measured via F1-score. The final model was trained on the entire training dataset, the performance was evaluated on the 200-song validation dataset by measuring the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC auc), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\nFor initial model selection, grid search was performed on three separate naive Bayes models to select the best performing combination of feature extraction and selection approaches and parameters for each model. These three models were Multi-variate Bernoulli Bayes with binary word counts as feature vectors, multinomial Bayes with term frequency features, and multinomial naive Bayes with tf-idf features. After the three models had been individually optimized via grid search, the performance of the best performing model, from each of the three categories, was evaluated via ROC auc. The best performing model was then chosen for a more thorough optimization via grid search.\nTable 1: Mood label distribution in the training and validation datasets.\nMood Training Validation Total\nhappy 446 95 541 sad 554 95 649\nFigure 2: Wordcloud visualizations of the most frequent words of the happy songs (A) and sad songs (B) in the training dataset. The size of the words is proportional to the frequency across lyrics.\nDuring the grid search optimization, the following settings and parameters were optimized: n-gram range for tokenization, stop words removal, Porter stemming, the maximum number of features in the vocabulary (based on the k most frequent tokens), a cut-off for minimum term frequency, and the α smoothing parameter."

      "text" : "The wordcloud visualizations of the most frequent words in the training dataset show an overlap between the most frequent words (love, know, come) between the happy and sad songs (Figure 2). Grouping the songs by release year shows that the random 1000-song sub sample from the Million Song Dataset is bias towards more recent releases (Figure 3 A); interestingly, the fraction of sad songs increases over time Figure (Figure 3 B).\nAfter grid search for three separate naive Bayes classification models yielded an almost equal performance as shown in Figure 4A. The best performing model was a multinomial naive Bayes classifier (average ROC auc 0.75) with a 1-gram tf-idf feature representation after applying Porter stemming for suffix stripping and additional stop word removal. Further evaluation showed that tuning of the α smoothing parameter, minimum term frequency cut-off value, and maximum size of the vocabulary had little effect on the performance of the chosen classification model Figure\n4C-E; the attempt to increase the the n-gram range had a visibly negative effect on the classification performance 4F.\nAfter model selection, the final classifier was trained on the complete training dataset and the performance was evaluated based on the validation dataset. The mood classifier achieved a precision performance of 99.60% on the training set and a precision of 88.89% on the 200-sample validation set, suggesting that it may suffer from overfitting."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4 Discussion",
      "text" : "The exploratory data analysis of the training corpus showed that the fraction of sad songs increases over the years (Figure 3. However, it has to be considered that distribution of songs per year is heavily biased towards more recent releases and older music is underrepresented in the training sample. The apparent trend is still interesting and suggests that modern society could be exposed to a larger amount of sad songs than previous generations, which makes a music recommendation system, which can be used as a mood filter, particularly interesting. All three of the different naive Bayes models that were optimized via grid search showed a better performance when stop words were removed from the lyrics (Figure 4). However, the higher ROC auc score of the model that was trained on tf-idf feature vectors suggests that the lyrics corpus still contained several non-relevant words that were common among both happy and sad songs as it can be seen in the wordclouds (Figure ??). As expected, the multinomial naive Bayes models showed a better performance than the Bernoulli naive Bayes models which used only binary feature vectors as input. Although the mood classifier has a high precision for both the training (99.60%) and validation (88.89%) dataset, the results indicate that the cross-validation approach for model selection did not completely overcome the problem of over-fitting, which might be partially due to the large number of settings and parameters that were evaluated dur- ing grid search and the relatively small size of the training dataset. Also, the low recall rate might also be due to the equal class distribution of happy and sad songs in the validation dataset since the prior probabilities of the naive Bayes model were estimated from the training dataset which contained a larger fraction of sad songs. However, the high precision of the classifier is still satisfactory given the proposed goal of confidently removing sad songs from an extensive music library before performing the genre classification. Based on the promising results, future directions include the re-evaluation of the model using a larger training dataset and mood labels selected by majority support based on labels provided by different individuals."
    }, {
      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "The results have shown that a naive Bayes model applied to mood classification based lyrics can predict the positive class (happy) with high precision, which can be useful to filter a large music library for happy music with a low false positive rate. A music library filtered in this manner could further be used as input for genre classification to filter music according to different tastes. Planned future work will include extensions to the mood classification web application to incorporate more\nlyrics to evaluate if the predictive performance of the classifier can be improved given a larger dataset. The extensions will include feedback about the prediction. In one extension, online learning will be implemented to update the hypothesis incrementally."
