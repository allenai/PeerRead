      "text" : "We formalize a new machine learning paradigm, infinite-label learning, where the goal is to learn a labeling function to annotate a data point with all relevant labels from a candidate set, which pools both the finite labels observed at training and a potentially infinite number of previously unseen labels. Infinite-labeling learning is motivated by a plethora of real-world applications. As below, we give a few examples to facilitate our further discussion.\nImage tagging. More than 50% of the Flickr images have no text tags and are never retrieved for text queries. As a result, automatically suggesting relevant tags/labels for the images is a pressing need and yet a daunting challenge; there are more than 53M tags on Flickr. Moreover, tons of new tags emerge over time.\nAds-query association. Search engines allow advertisers to bid on user queries to deliver ads to targeted audience. It is both commercially intriguing and scientifically interesting to automatically associate the virtually infinite number of user queries (labels) to the ads (data points).\nText categorization. The wikipedia pages are grouped by more than 200K categories. A text might be about any of science, politics, finance, and/or other topics. Infinite-label learning can save the writers from the tedious process of manually classifying the future wikipedia pages, even if new categories are added to wikipedia.\nThe above problems are actually often used to benchmark different (extreme) multi-label learning algorithms [21, 23, 3]. However, we contend that the conventional multi-label learning tackles the problems on the surface, and fails to consider any new labels that appear in the test stage and were omitted from the training stage. In a sharp contrast, infinite-label learning fundamentally expands the scope of multi -label learning; it is expected to explicitly handle novel labels that show up after the labeling function has been learned.\nHow can we learn a labeling function that is capable of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot learning [15, 19, 8, 17], where the key is to represent a class by a vector of semantic codes [15], as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We can thus learn a labeling function to take as input a data point and a label’s semantic codes, and output whether or not the encoded label is relevant to the data. Both seen and unseen labels are encoded by the same mechanism and usually by the same knowledge base. As a result, the labeling function learned from a finite training set is able to extrapolate to the labels unseen during the training. To verify this intuition, we provide a PAC bound (Section 3) and some empirical studies (Section 4) on both synthetic and real data.\nThe semantic codes of the class labels are often derived from a large knowledge base in addition to the training set. Thanks to the studies in linguistics, words in speech recognition are represented by combinations of phonemes [22]. In visual object recognition, a class is described by a set of visual attributes [10, 7]. More recently, the distributed representations of English words [12, 16] have found their applications in a variety of tasks.\nWe organize the remaining of the paper as follows. Section 2 formally states the problem of infinite-label learning and contrasts it to some related work. A PAC bound and some theoretical analyses are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, we experimentally study the proposed infinite-label learning and reveal some of its empirical properties. Section 5 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "Suppose we have a set of semantic codes of the labels L = {λl ∈ Rn}Ll=1 and a training sample S = {(xm,ym) ∈ Rd × {−1,+1}L}Mm=1, where the annotation yml = +1 indicates that the l-th label, which is semantically encoded as λl, is relevant to the m-th data point xm. The semantic codes could be the distributed representations of English words, phoneme composition of words in speech, co-occurrence vector, or visual attributes of objects. For brevity, we refer to the semantic codes of the labels L = {λl}Ll=1 as labels in the rest of the paper. Denote by U = {λl}l>L another set of labels disjoint from L. The labels in U correspond to no data points in the training sample and thus often termed zero-shot labels [10, 24]. The objective of infinite-label learning is to infer a labeling function h : Rd 7→ 2L∪U from the training sample S and observed labels L, such that h(x) ⊆ L ∪ U assigns all the relevant labels to a test instance x."

      "heading" : "2.2 A modeling assumption",
      "text" : "We consider the following distributions over the data in infinite-label learning,\nx ∼ PX , λ ∼ PΛ, y(λ;x) ∼ PY |XΛ, where PXY Λ = PXPΛPY |XΛ, (1)\nwhere PXY Λ denotes the joint distribution of the data point x, label assignment indicators y, and the label λ. In this paper, we consider a deterministic/noiseless label assignment function y(λ;x) ∼ PY |XΛ, and leave the more generic case to the future work.\nNote that we explicitly treat the labels L ∪ U as an i.i.d. sample drawn from the marginal distribution PΛ. Moreover, we make the following observation: any data point x can be regarded as incurring a binary classification rule, denoted by y(·;x), over the label space, such that y(λ;x) = +1 tells that the label λ ∼ PΛ is relevant to the data x and y(λ;x) = −1 means the opposite. This rule is only partially observed at training in the form of the data annotations ym.\nImmediately following the above modeling assumption, our learning objective is to infer the (conditional) classification rule y(·;x) for the labels from the training sample S. We consider a fixed set of hypotheses H for the rule y(·;x), and then select a hypothesis h ∈ H such that it gives rise to the smallest generalization risk,\nR(h) = Ex∼PXEλ∼PΛEy∼PY |XΛ [h(λ;x) 6= y] (2)\nwhere [·] is the 0-1 loss. We provide a PAC bound in Section 3 for the risk along with its empirical estimate from the training set S,\nR̂(h) = 1\nML M∑ m=1 L∑ l=1 L(h(λl;xm), yml) + Ω(h), (3)\nwhere L(·) is a 0-1 loss (in practice one uses a surrogate differentiable loss), and Ω(h) is a regularization over h. At the high level, the risk of infinite-label learning can be understood as the traditional binary classification risk over the label λ and assignment y|x, conditioning on the variable X representing the input data.\nIt is worth pointing out the implication of eq. (3): we employ a “non-canonical” data sampling process from the underlying distribution PXY Λ = PXPΛPY |XΛ. Instead of sampling i.i.d. triplets {(xk,λk, yk)}k≥1 from PXY Λ, we draw from PX for M times to have {xm}Mm=1, draw from PΛ for L times and obtain {λl}Ll=1. After that, we use the (deterministic) label assignment function y(λ;x) to assign the binary (ir)relevance to all the pairwise combination of data and labels, i.e., we arrive at M× L training data points {(xm,λl, yml)}m∈[M],l∈[L] and they are non-i.i.d."

We give some examples below, and will examine Example 1 both theoretically (Section 3) and empirically (Section 4).\nExample 1. Assuming that each label λ ∈ L ∪ U is represented by a vector (e.g., word vectors, attributes, or click-through statistics) and h(λ;x) = sgn 〈V x,λ〉, we essentially try to find a hyper-plane V x for classifying either seen or unseen labels {λ} by minimizing the empirical risk in eq.

      "text" : "The modeling of the data, label, and label assignment in infinite-label learning is in sharp contrast to the prevalent modeling assumptions for the traditional classification problems or the closely related multi-label learning problems, none of which induce the labels L and the label assignment y by separate distributions. We particularly compare the infinite-label learning to multi-label learning [21, 23, 3] in Table 1. Multi-label learning usually assumes that the training sample S = {(xm,ym)}Mm=1 is drawn i.i.d. from the joint distribution PXY , totally ignoring the distribution of the labels L. Consequently, the multi-label classifiers cannot deal with any unseen labels in U .\nWe can understand infinite-label learning as a natural extension of zero-shot learning [15, 19, 8, 17]. They both rely on an external knowledge base for encoding the classes/labels, in addition to the training set, in order to extrapolate the learned classifier or labeling function to handle previously unseen classes/labels. Their difference echos that between multi-label and multi-class classifications, namely, infinite-label learning assigns more than one relevant labels to a data point while under zero-shot learning a data point can belong to one and only one class.\nThe recent works of label embedding [9, 25, 3, 1] and landmark label sampling [2, 4] are particularly related to ours. However, their label representations are inferred from the training set and are not applicable to unseen labels. Moreover, they lack the basic modeling of the labels as introduced in this paper, that the labels λ are drawn i.i.d. from the distribution PΛ. The most recent works [13, 24] can be regarded as specific instantiations of infinite-label learning, while we formally formulate the problem and provide both theoretical and empirical studies as follows. In addition, the pairwise learning [20] is a very interesting framework which encapsulates matrix completion, collaborative filtering, zero-shot and the infinite-label learning. As a result, our analyses apply to pairwise learning when yh is binary in [20]."

      "heading" : "3 Infinite-label learning under the PAC learning framework",
      "text" : "In this section, we examine the theoretical properties of infinite-label learning under the PAC learning framework. Given the training sample S = {(xm,ym) ∈ Rd×{−1,+1}L}Mm=1 and the semantic codes of the seen labels L = {λl ∈ Rn}Ll=1, the theorem below sheds lights on the numbers of data points and labels that are necessary to achieve a particular level of error. The supplementary materials give tighter bounds under some sparse regularizations over the hypothesis set H.\nTheorem 1. For any δ > 0 and any h(x,λ) ∈ H := {sgn 〈V x,λ〉 | V ∈ Rn×d}, the following holds with probability at least 1− δ,\nExEλEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y] ≤ 1\nML M∑ m=1 L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l]+\n2 max\n(√ 8 log(8/δ) + 8d log(2eM/d)\nM ,\n√ 8 log(8M/δ) + 8n log(2eL/n)\nL\n) . (4)\nThis generalization error bound is roughly O(1/M + 1/L) if all log terms are ignored. When M and L converge to infinity, the error vanishes. An immediate implication is the learnability of the infinite-label learning: to obtain a certain accuracy on all labels, one does not have to observe all of them in the training phase. Another interesting implication for practice is that M and L should be chosen in the same order, because M L (or M L) would not bring significant improvements to the generalization bound. Acute readers may notice that the classifier 〈V x,λ〉 can be cast into 〈V,λx>〉, which is in the form of the vanilla linear classifier1. However, a fundamental difference from the linear classifier lies on that the sample triplets (xm,λl, yml) are not independent in the empirical risk (cf. eq. (3)), causing the main challenge in analysis.\n1Remark: We note that the bound is indeed close to that for the linear classifier except the term of log(M)/L. This term is likely an artifact of our proof and may be removed by finer analysis.\nProof. To prove the theorem, we essentially need to consider the following probability bound:\nP ( ∃ h ∈ H : ExEλEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]− 1\nML M∑ m=1 L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l)] ≥\n)\n=P ( ∃ h ∈ H : ExEλEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]− 1\nM M∑ m=1 EλEy|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]\n+ 1\nM M∑ m=1 EλEy|x,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]− 1 ML M∑ m=1 L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l] ≥\n)\n≤P ( ∃ h ∈ H : ExEλEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]− 1\nM M∑ m=1 EλEy|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y] ≥ 2\n) (5)\n+ P ( ∃ h ∈ H : 1\nM M∑ m=1 EλEy|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]− 1 ML ∑ m,l [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l] ≥ 2\n) (6)\nwhere the last inequality is due to the fact P(a+ b ≥ ) ≤ P(a ≥ /2) +P(b ≥ /2). Next we consider the bound for the two terms (5) and (6) above respectively.\nFor the first term (5), we have\nP ( ∃h ∈ H : Ex,λ,y[h(x,λ) 6= y]− 1\nM M∑ m=1 Eλ,y|xm [h(xm,λ) 6= y] ≥ 1\n)\n=P ( ∃h ∈ H : Ex,λEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]− Eλ ( 1\nM M∑ m=1 Ey|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]\n) ≥ 1 )\n≤P ( ∃h ∈ H,∃λ ∈ L : ExEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]− ( 1\nM M∑ m=1 Ey|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]\n) ≥ 1 ) (7)\nwhere the first equality is due to the dependence between λ and xm. Denote Ey|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y] by a function f(xm). We have E(f(xm)) = ExEy|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y]. f(x1), · · · , f(xm) are i.i.d. random variables in {0, 1} — recall that PY |XΛ is deterministic. Define F to be a hypothesis space\nF := {f(x) = Ey|x,λ[h(x,λ) 6= y] | h ∈ H, λ ∈ L}.\nUsing the new notation, we can rewrite (7) in the following\nP ( ∃f ∈ F : E(f(x))− 1\nM M∑ m=1 f(xm) ≥ 1 ) ≤ 4r(F , 2M,X )× exp(−M 21/8) (8)\nwhere the inequality uses the Growth function bound, and r(F , 2M,X ) is number of maximally possible configurations (or values of {f(x1), · · · , f(x2M)}) given 2M samples in X over the hypothesis space F . Since h(x,λ) is in the form of sgn〈V x,λ〉, r(F , 2M,X ) is bounded by r(W, 2M,X ) with W := {sgn(w>x) | w ∈ Rd}. Hence, we have\nr(F , 2M,X ) ≤ r(W, 2M,X ) ≤ ( 2eM\nd\n)VC(Rd) = ( 2eM\nd\n)d (9)\nwhere VC(Rd) is the VC dimension for the space Rd. We then have\n(8) ≤ 4 ( 2eM\nd\n)d × exp(−M 21/8).\nBy letting the right hand side equal δ/2, we have\n1 =\n√ 8 log 8/δ + 8d log(2eM/d)\nM . (10)\nNext we consider the upper bound for (6):\nP ( ∃h ∈ H : 1\nM M∑ m=1 Eλ,y|xm [h(xm,λ) 6= y]− 1 M M∑ m=1 1 L L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l] ≥ 2\n) (11)\n=P ( ∃h ∈ H : 1\nM M∑ m=1 EλEy|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]− 1 M M∑ m=1 1 L L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l] ≥ 2\n)\n≤P ( ∃h ∈ H, ∃m ∈ {1, · · · ,M} : EλEy|xm,λ[h(xm,λ) 6= y]− 1\nL L∑ l=1 [h(xm,λl) 6= ym,l] ≥ 2\n)\n≤M× P ( ∃h ∈ H : Ey,λ|x1 [h(x1,λ) 6= y]− 1\nL L∑ l=1 [h(x1,λl) 6= y1,l] ≥ 2\n) . (12)\nwhere the last inequality uses the union bound. Denote [h(x1,λ) 6= y] by g(λ, y) for short. Then we have E(g(λ, y)) = Ey,λ|x1 [h(x1,λ) 6= y] and g(λ1, y1,1), · · · , g(λL, y1,L) are i.i.d. samples taking values from {0, 1} given x1. Define G to be a hypothesis space\nG := {g(λ, y) = [h(λ,x1) 6= y] | h ∈ H}.\nThen we can cast the probabilistic factor in (12) into\nP ( ∃g ∈ G : E(g(λ, y))− 1\nL L∑ l=1 g(λl, yl) ≥ 2 ) ≤ 4r(G, 2L,L)× exp(−L 22/8) (13)\nwhere the last inequality uses the Growth function bound again. To bound r(G, 2L,L), we consider the structure of h(x,λ) = sgn(V x,λ) and define W ′ = {sgn(z>λ) | z ∈ Rn}. It suggests that\nr(G, 2L,L) ≤ r(W ′, 2L,Rn) ≤ ( 2eL\nn\n)VC(Rn) = ( 2eL\nn\n)n .\nHence we have (11) ≤ 4M\n( 2eL\nn\n)n × exp(−L 22/8).\nBy letting the right hand side equal δ/2, we have\n2 =\n√ 8 log 8M/δ + 8n log(2eL/n)\nL . (14)\nPlugging (10) and (14) into (5) and (6) respectively, we prove the theorem."

      "text" : "We generate some synthetic data to answer the first question. This offers us the flexibility to control the number of labels.\nData. We randomly sample 500 training data points {xm ∈ R3}M=500m=1 and 1000 testing data points from a five-component Gaussian mixture model. We also sample 10 seen labels L = {λl ∈ R2}L=10l=1 and additional 2990 unseen labels U = {λ11, · · · ,λ3000} from a Gaussian distribution. Note that only the seen labels L are revealed during the training stage. As below specifies the distributions,\nx ∼ P (x) = 5∑\nk=1\nπkN ( µk,UkU T k , ) , λ ∼ N ([ 2 3 ] , [ 1 1.5 1.5 3 ]) , x ∈ R3, λ ∈ R2\nwhere the mixture weights πk are sampled from a Dirichlet distribution Dir(3, 3, 3, 3, 3), and both mean µk and Uk are sampled from a standard normal distribution (using the randn function in MATLAB). Finally, we generate a “groundtruth” matrix V ∈ R2×3 from a standard normal distribution. The label assignments are thus given by yml = sgn 〈V xm,λl〉 for both training and testing data and both seen and unseen labels. For the training set S = {(xm,ym)}M=500m=1 , we randomly flip the sign of each yml with probability p = 0.1.\nWe deliberately choose the low dimensions for the data and labels so that we can visualize them and have a concrete understanding about the results to be produced. Figure 1(a) and (b) show the data points and labels we have sampled. The training data and the seen labels are in red color, while all the other (test) data points and labels are unseen during training.\nGiven the training set S, we learn the model parameters by minimizing a hinge loss\nV̂ ← arg min V\n1\nML M=500∑ m=1 L=10∑ l=1 max (1− yml 〈V xm,λl〉 , 0) ,\nand then try to assign both seen and unseen labels L ∪ S to the 1000 test data points, using V̂ . We challenge the learned infinite-label assignment model yml = sgn 〈 V̂ xm,λl 〉 by gradually increasing the difficulties. Namely, we rank all the labels according to their distances to the seen labels L, where the distance between λl and the seen labels L is calculated by minλ∈L ‖λ− λl‖2. We then\nevaluate the label assignment results given every 500 consecutive labels in the ranking list (as well as the 10 seen labels). Arguably, the last 500 labels, which are the furthest subset of labels from the seen labels L, impose the biggest challenge to the learned model.\nResults. Figure 1(c) shows the label assignment errors for different subsets of labels. We run 5 rounds of experiments each with different randomly sampled data, and report their results as well as the average. We borrow from multi-label classification [23] the Hamming loss as the evaluation metric. It is computed by 11000 ∑1000 m=1(|ym 6= zm|T1)/|ym|T1, where ym is the groundtruth label assignments to the data point xm and zm is the predictions. Note that this is inherently different from the classification accuracy/error used for evaluating multi-class classification.\nWe draw the following observations from Figure 1(c). First, infinite-label learning is feasible since we have obtained decent classification results for 3000 labels although only 10 of them are seen in training. Second, when the unseen labels are not far from the seen labels, the label assignment results are on par with the performance of assigning only the seen labels to the test data (cf. the Hamming losses over the first, second, and third 500-label subsets). Third, labels that are far from the seen labels may cause larger confusions to the infinite-label assignment model learned from finite seen labels. Increasing the number of seen labels and/or data points during training can improve the model’s generalization capability to unseen labels."

      "heading" : "4.2 Image tagging",
      "text" : "We experiment with image tagging to seek empirical answers to the second question raised at the beginning of this section.\nImage tagging is a real scenario that can benefit from the proposed work. It is often defined as ranking a set of labels for a query image. The main challenge in practice, however, is that the candidate set could be very large—there are about 53M tags on Flickr. Under infinite-label learning, one does not need to see all the candidate tags during training; otherwise much tedious human efforts are required to tag the images. Instead, we can learn a labeling function from a small number of seen tags and then apply it to all the possible tags. In this case, how many seen tags should we use in order to achieve about the same results as using all the tags for training? This is exactly the second question we asked at the beginning of this section.\nData. We conduct our experiments using the NUS-WIDE dataset [6]. It has 269,648 images in total although we are only able to retrieve 223,821 images using the provided image URLs. Among them, 134,281 are training images and the rest are testing images, according to the split by NUS-WIDE. We further randomly choose 20% of the training images as a validation set. The image features x are l2-normalized VGGNet-19 [18] last fully-connected-layer activations.\nEach image in NUS-WIDE has been manually annotated with the relevant tags out of 81 candidate tags in total. We obtain their semantic codes by the pre-trained GloVe word vectors [16]. While all the 81 tags are considered at the test stage, we randomly choose L = 81 (100% out of the 81 tags), 73 (90% out of the 81 tags), 65 (80% out of 81), 57 (70% out of 81), 49 (60% out of 81), and 41 (50% out of 81) seen tags for training different labeling functions h(λ;x) = sgn 〈V x,λ〉. Note that some training images would have no relevant tags under some settings; we simply drop them out from the training and validation sets.\nLearning and evaluation. Image tagging is often evaluated based on the top few tags returned by a system, assuming that users do not care about the remaining tags. We report the results measured by four popular metrics: Mean image Average Precision (MiAP) [11] and the top-3 precision, recall, and F1-score. Accordingly, in order to impose the ranking property to our labeling function, we learn it using the RankNet loss [5],\nV̂ ← arg min V\n1\nM M∑ m=1\n1\n(L− Km)Km ∑ k:ymk=+1 k̄:ymk̄=−1 log(1 + exp(〈V xm,λk̄〉 − 〈V xm,λk〉)) + γ ‖V ‖2 ,\nwhere Km is the number of relevant tags to the m-th image. The hyper-parameter γ is tuned by the MiAP results on the validation set for each experiment.\nBaselines. We compare our results to those of two zeroshot learning methods, respectively proposed by Norouzi et al. [14] and Akata et al. [1]. Both methods are developed for multi-class classification, namely, to classify an image to one and only one of the tags/classes. When we use them to solve the multi-label image tagging problem, different tags/classes will have duplicated images. In other words, they are naturally flawed in solving the infinite-label learning problem. We still include them as the references here, since there is no prior work to handle both multi-label learning and unseen labels at testing, to the best of our knowledge.\nResults. Figure 2 shows the MiAP results under different numbers of seen tags. We include the results evaluated by other metrics (the top-3 precision, recall, and F1-score) in the supplementary materials. Recall that although we train the labeling functions using different numbers of seen\ntags, the task at the testing stage remains the same for them: the labeling functions rank all the 81 tags for each test image (and return the top few as the suggested tags).\nWe can see that, without any surprise, the performance decreases as less seen tags are used for training. However, the decrease is fairly gentle—the MiAP drops by 1% and 3% (absolutely) using from 100% to 90% and from 90% to 80% of the 81 tags for training, respectively. Besides, no matter under which experiment setting, the proposed infinite-label learning outperforms the zero-shot learning methods by a large margin, thanks to that it is a more appropriate solution to the image tagging problem. It is interesting to see that the gaps between infinite-label learning and zero-shot learning methods are smaller as the seen tags become less, likely because the overlapped images between different tags/classes are reduced and the tagging problem approaches multi-class classification in training."

    "abstractText" : "We develop a new statistical machine learning paradigm, named infinite-label learning, to annotate a data point with more than one relevant labels from a candidate set, which pools both the finite labels observed at training and a potentially infinite number of previously unseen labels. The infinite-label learning fundamentally expands the scope of conventional multi-label learning, and better models the practical requirements in various real-world applications, such as image tagging, ads-query association, and article categorization. However, how can we learn a labeling function that is capable of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot learning, where the key is to represent a class/label by a vector of semantic codes, as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We validate the infinite-label learning by a PAC bound in theory and some empirical studies on both synthetic and real data. 1 ar X iv :1 60 8. 06 60 8v 1 [ cs .L G ] 2 3 A ug 2 01 6",
