      "text" : "Living organisms intertwine soft (e.g., muscle) and hard (e.g., bones) materials, giving them an intrinsic flexibility and resiliency often lacking in conventional rigid robots. The emerging field of soft robotics seeks to harness these same properties in order to create resilient machines. The nature of soft materials, however, presents considerable challenges to aspects of design, construction, and control – and up until now, the vast majority of gaits for soft robots have been hand-designed through empirical trial-and-error. This manuscript describes an easy-to-assemble tensegritybased soft robot capable of highly dynamic locomotive gaits and demonstrating structural and behavioral resilience in the face of physical damage. Enabling this is the use of a machine learning algorithm able to discover novel gaits with a minimal number of physical trials. These results lend further credence to soft-robotic approaches that seek to harness the interaction of complex material dynamics in order to generate a wealth of dynamical behaviors.\nUNLIKE machines, animals exhibit a tremendous amount of re-silience, due in part to their intertwining of soft tissues and rigid skeletons. In nature, this suppleness leads to several compelling behaviors which exploit the dynamics of soft systems. Octopi, for example, are able to adaptively shape their limbs with “joints” in order to perform efficient grasping1. Jellyfish exploit their inherent elasticity in order to passively recover energy during swimming2. Manduca sexta caterpillars have a mid-gut which acts like a “visceral-locomotory piston” – sliding forward ahead of the surrounding soft tissues, shifting the animal’s center of mass forward well before any visible exterior change3.\nTaking inspiration from the natural world, the field of soft robotics seeks to address some of the constraints of conventional rigid robots through the use of compliant, flexible, and elastic materials7, 8. Trimmer et al., for instance, construct soft robots from silicone rubber, using shape-memory alloy (SMA) microcoil actuation, which can slowly crawl in controlled fashion9 or roll in an uncontrolled ballistic fashion10. Similarly, research by Whitesides et al. uses pneumatic inflation to produce slow, dynamically stable crawling motions11 as well as fast, but less controlled tentacle-like grippers12, combustion-driven jumpers13 and a self-contained microfluidic “octobot”8.\nDespite their advantages, soft-material robots are difficult to control by conventional means7, 11. They are by their very nature high dimensional dynamic systems with an essentially infinite number of degrees of freedom. The elasticity and deformability which provide their appeal come at the cost of resonances and tight dynamic coupling between components9, properties which are often avoided, or at least suppressed, in conventional engineering approaches to robotic design. This complexity precludes the use of many of the traditional kinematic and inversedynamics approaches to robotic control14.\nAs a result, up until now, the locomotive gaits of most soft robots have been developed by hand through empirical trialand-error11. This process can be both challenging and time consuming, particularly when seeking to fully exploit the dynamical\ncomplexity of soft mechanisms. Importantly, this manual process also prevents these robots from adapting their control strategy when the context changes, for instance when they encounter an unexpected type of terrain, or when they are physically damaged.\nIn this work, we introduce a new class of soft robot based upon a tensegrity structure driven by vibration. Like many other soft robots, this tensegrity robot is resilient, and can resist damage when perturbed or crushed. Unlike other soft robots, however, this particular modular tensegrity robot is easy to build, easy to control, and thanks to a data-efficient reinforcement learning algorithm15, it can autonomously discover how to move, and quickly relearn and adapt its behavior when damaged."

      "text" : "Tensegrities are relatively simple mechanical systems, consisting of a number of rigid elements (struts) joined at their endpoints by tensile elements (cables or springs), and kept stable through a synergistic interplay of pre-stress forces (Fig. 1 A-C). Beyond engineering, properties of tensegrity has been demonstrated at all scales of the natural world, ranging from the tendinous network of the human hand16 to the mechanotransduction of living cells6. At every size, tensegrity structures exhibit two interesting features4, 5: they have an impressive strength-to-weight ratio, and\nRieffel and Mouret arXiv | 1\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n03 25\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.R O\n] 1\n0 Fe\nb 20\n17\nthey are structurally robust and stable in the face of deformation. Moreover, unlike many other soft robots, tensegrity structures are inherently modular (consisting of only struts and springs) and are therefore relatively easy to construct. They are simple enough to be featured in books for children activities17, while complex enough to serve as the basis for the next generation of NASA’s planetary rovers18.\nUnfortunately, the control methods used in traditional robotics cannot be applied to tensegrity robots: the dynamical complexity and the high number of degrees of freedom make them very difficult to accurately model, simulate, and control18. The most common strategy is to slowly change the lengths of the struts and/or cables, which results in large-scale, quasi-static (rather than dynamic) structural deformations, which, in turn, make the robot move18, 19. As they assume that the structure is stiff, such control strategies are not suitable for soft tensegrity robots. In addition, they lead to slow locomotion speeds.\nMore recently, researchers have begun investigating more dynamical methods of tensegrity robot control. Bliss et al. have used central pattern generators (CPGs) to produce resonance entrainment of simulated non-mobile tensegrity structures 20. Mirletz et al. have used CPGs to produce goal-directed behavior in simulated tensegrity-spine-based robots 21. These efforts, however valuable, were all produced in simulated environments, and have not yet been successfully transferred into real-world robots. As Mirletz et al point out 20, the dynamic behavior of tensegrities is highly dependent upon the substrate they interact with – this means that results developed in simulated environments cannot necessarily be simply transferred to real robots (in Evolutionary Robotics, this is known as the “Reality Gap” 22, 23).\nHere we explore the hypothesis that the inherent resonance and dynamical complexity of real-world soft tensegrity robots can be beneficially harnessed (rather than suppressed), and that, if properly excited24, it can resonate so that the robot performs step-like patterns that enable it to “walk”. To test this hypothesis and demonstrate the potential of soft tensegrity robots, we designed a pocked-size, soft tensegrity robot whose parameters were tuned to maximize resonance, and whose goal is to locomote as fast as possible across flat terrain. To find the right resonances, we equipped the robot with a data-efficient trial-and-error algorithm, which also allows it to adapt when needed.\nOur soft tensegrity robot (Fig. 1D-E) is based upon a canonical six-bar tensegrity shape consisting of equal length composite\nstruts connected via 24 identical helical springs, with four springs emanating from each strut end. Unlike most tensegrity structures, which seek to maximize stiffness24, the spring constants of our robot were chosen with the goal of producing suitably small natural frequencies of the structure, with corresponding large displacements – in other words, to maximize suppleness. This allows the pocket sized robot to maintain its structural shape under normal operation, and yet be easily compressed flat in one’s hand. A variable speed motor coupled to offset masses was then attached to three of the struts in order to excite the natural frequencies of the structure.\nLike many robots, the tensegrity robot needs to use different gaits in order to achieve lomocotion, depending on terrain. In our case, these gaits are determined by the speeds of the three vibratory motors. As the exact properties of the terrain are seldom known a priori, and because hand-designing gaits is time consuming (not to mention impossible when the robot is in remote or hazardous environments) this robot finds effective motor frequencies by using a trial-and-error learning algorithm whose goal is to maximize the locomotion speed.\nEarlier work of ours 25, 26 used interactive trial-and-error as well as automated hill climbing techniques to find optimal gaits for a tensegrity robot. These gaits, could in turn, be incorporated into a simple state machine for directional control. However, these techniques required hundreds of physical trials that were time consuming and produced significant wear on the physical robot. More importantly, the interactive procedure required an human in the loop, whereas we envision robots that can adapt autonomously to new situations (e.g. a damage or a new terrain).\nHere, as a substantial improvement upon these earlier timeintensive intensive methods, we employ a Bayesian optimization algorithm15, 27, 28, which is a mathematical optimizer designed to find the maximum of a performance function with as few trials as possible.\nConceptually, Bayesian optimization fits a probabilistic model (here a Gaussian process29, see Methods) that maps motor speeds to locomotion speed. Because the model is probabilistic, the algorithm can not only predict which motor speeds are the most likely to be good, but also associate it to a confidence level. Bayesian optimization exploits this model to select the next trial by balancing exploitation – selecting motor speeds that are likely to make the robot move faster – and exploration – trying combinations of motor speeds that have not been tried so far (Methods). As an additional benefit, this algorithm can take into account that observations are by nature uncertain.\nThe Bayesian optimization algorithm usually starts with a con-\nRieffel and Mouret arXiv | 2\nstant prior for the expected observation (e.g., the expected speed is 10 cm/s) and a few randomly chosen trials to initialize the model. For this robot, however, common sense, along with preliminary modeling, suggests that speeds near the motor maximums are more likely to produce successful gaits, and that nearzero motor speeds are not expected to make the robot move. This insight was substantiated in preliminary experiments: many effective gaits were produced by high motor speeds, both forward and backward. Therefore, to speed up learning, we use a nonlinear prior model as follows: (1) if the three motor speeds are close to 0, then we should expect a locomotion speed close to 0 and (2) if all the motors are close to full speed (in any direction), then we should expect the maximum locomotion speed (Methods and Fig. 5D). Thanks to this prior, the Bayesian optimization algorithm does not need any random sample points to seed the prior and will instead start with promising solutions. In spite of this prior, learning is needed because many combinations of motors at full speeds make the robot tumble or rotate on itself, resulting in low performance; in addition, subtle changes to motor speeds can have dramatic effects upon the resulting robot gait.\nWe first evaluate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm (Fig. 2). The performance function is the locomotion speed, measured over 3 seconds, in any direction. If the robot turns too much, that is if the yaw exceeds a threshold, the evaluation is stopped (Methods). The covered distance is measured with an external motion capture system (Methods), although similar measurements can be obtained with an onboard visual odometry system15, 30. We compare three algorithms: random search, Bayesian optimization without prior (using 10 random points to initialize the algorithm), and Bayesian optimization with prior. Each algorithm is allowed to test 30 different motor combinations (resulting in 90 seconds of learning for each experiment) and is independently run 20 times to gather statistics. The results show that the best locomotion speeds are obtained with the prior-based Bayesian optimization (11.5cm/s, 5th and 95th percentiles [8.1, 13.7]), followed by the prior-free Bayesian optimization (6.3cm/s[5.5, 12.4]). The worst results are obtained with the random search (5.4cm/s[3.5, 9.9]). Overall, these experiments demonstrate that the prior-based Bayesian optimization is an effective way to automatically discover a gait in only 30 trials with this robot. Videos of the gaits are available as supplementary material (Video S1).\nWe then investigate our hypothesis that the interplay between a flexible tensegrity structure and vibration is the key for effective locomotion. To do so, we designed a rigid replica of our robot that does not contain any springs: the carbon fiber struts are held in place with small carbon fiber rods (Fig. 4A). All the dimensions, strut positions, and motor positions are the same as for the tensegrity version (Fig. 1D-E). We used the same learning algorithm as for the tensegrity robot and replicated the learning experiment 20 times. The results (Fig. 4B) show that that the rigid replica is about 1.5 times slower than the tensegrity robot (7.1cm/s[5.6, 9.3] vs 11.5cm/s[8.1, 13.7]), which suggests that the flexibility of the tensegrity structure plays a critical role in its effective locomotion. In addition, we measured the amplitude of movement along the vertical axis for the end of 4 struts, both with the soft tensegrity robot and the rigid replica; we repeated this measure with 50 random gaits in both cases. These measurements (Fig. 4C) show that the markers move at least twice more when the structure is flexible (2.3[1.5, 4.8] cm vs 0.99[0.61, 2.1] cm), which demonstrates that the structure amplifies the movements induced by the vibrators.\nIn addition of being deformable, tensegrity structures often maintain most of their shape when a link (a spring or a strut) is missing, leading to relatively smooth failure modes. We evaluate the ability of our robot to operate after such damage by removing a spring (Fig. 3A). As the shape of the robot is changed, we relaunch the learning algorithms. The experiments reveal that successful, straight gaits can be found in 30 trials, although they\nare significantly lower-performing than gaits obtained with the intact robot (11.5cm/s[8.1, 13.7] versus 6.5cm/s[5.6, 8.2] Fig. 3B).\nDuring all the reported experiments, we evaluated 20×30×3 = 1800 different gaits on the intact robot, 20 × 30 = 600 gaits on the rigid robot (20 replicates, 30 trials for each replicate, and 3 treatments), and 20 × 30 = 600 gaits on the damaged robot. We can use these points to draw a picture of the search space that does not depend on the learning algorithm (Fig. 5). Since the search space is too high-dimensional to be easily visualized (3 dimensions + performance, resulting in a 4D plot), we compute performance profiles31, 32: for each combination of 2 motor speeds { v1, v2 } , we report the best performance measured regardless of the speed of the third motor (Methods). The performance profiles (Fig. 5A) for the intact robot reveal that there are two high-performing regions, roughly positioned around{ − 100%, 100%,−100% } and { − 100%,−100%, 100% } and that\nthe first region ( { − 100%, 100%,−100% } ) is where most highperforming solutions can be found. This finding is consistent with the prior given to the learning algorithm (Fig. 5D), which models that the best performance should be obtained with a combination of −100% and +100% values. It should be emphasized that the best gaits do not correspond to the most extreme values for the motor speeds: the most reliable optima is around{ − 90%, 100%,−90% } , mostly because too extreme values tend to make the robot tumble. The best solutions for the rigid robots are also found in the corners, that is, for combinations of +100% and−100% motor speeds, but the measurements suggest that the optimum might be different from the one obtained with the intact robot (more data would be needed to conclude). The data for the damaged robot show more clearly that the best solutions are around { − 100%,−100%, 100% } , which corresponds to the second optimum found for the intact robot (the lowest performing one).\nThe performance profiles thus demonstrate that the prior knowledge given to the learning algorithm is consistent with the three different robots (intact, rigid, and damaged), which suggests that it might be helpful in other situations (e.g., different damage conditions). They also demonstrate that gaits that work the best on the intact robot do not work on the damaged robot (Fig. 5 A versus C, second column): this shows that the learning algorithm is needed to adapt the gait if the robot is damaged.\nRieffel and Mouret arXiv | 3\nRieffel and Mouret arXiv | 4"

      "text" : "Soft tensegrity robots are highly resilient, easy to assemble with the current technology, and made with inexpensive materials. Thanks to the learning algorithm, our prototype can achieve locomotion speeds of more than 10 cm/s (more 1 body length per second) and learn new gaits in less than 30 trials, which allows it to adapt to damage or new situations. To our knowledge, this makes it one of the fastest soft robot.\nOur soft tensegrity robots achieve their speed because they harness the flexibility and the resonance of tensegrity structures, instead of trying to suppress it as it is done in architecture5 or in other tensegrity robots18, 19. Harnessing flexibility and resonance opens new research avenues for future tensegrity structures, in particular when mechanical design can be coupled with machine learning algorithms that automatically identify how to control the resonances.\nAs demonstrated here, vibration is an effective way to exploit structural flexibility; similar observations have been made with other, more rigid vibrating robots like the Kilobots33. A direct benefit is that it makes it easy to power soft tensegrity robots with an embedded battery, by contrast with the many fluidactuated soft robots7, 11, which need innovative ways to store energy8. Nevertheless, soft tensegrity robots could excite their structure by other means; for instance, a flywheel that is rapidly decelerated could help the robot to achieve fast movements34, or high-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations could be generated by moving a pendulum inside the structure35.\nPutting all these attractive features altogether, soft tensegrity robots combine simplicity, flexibility, performance, and resiliency, which makes this new class of robots one of the most promising building block for future soft robots.\nOverall, soft tensegrity robots move thanks to the complex interactions between the actuators (vibrators), the structure (springs and struts), and the environment (the ground). As a consequence, they do not have a centralized control-policy like conventional robots; instead, their abilities are distributed throughout the robot. This kind of emergent behavior is central in the embodied intelligence theory36, which suggests that we will achieve better and more life-like robots if we encourage such deep interactions between the body and the “mind” – here, the controller. However, as demonstrated in the present work, trial-and-error learning algorithms might be the only viable approaches to discover and adapt these emergent behaviors."

The six 9.4 cm long composite struts are cut from 6.35 mm square graphite composite tubes (Goodwinds).

It essentially implements a variant of Bayesian optimization, which is a stateof-the-art optimization algorithm designed to maximize expensive performance functions (a.k.a. cost functions) whose gradient cannot be evaluated analytically27, 28. Like other model-based optimization algorithms (e.g., surrogate-based algorithms37–39, kriging40, or DACE41, 42), Bayesian optimization models the objective function with a regression method, uses this model to select the next point to acquire, then updates the model, etc. until the algorithm has exhausted its budget of function evaluations.\nHere a Gaussian process models the objective function29, which is a common choice for Bayesian optimization27, 28, 43–45. For an unknown cost function f , a Gaussian process defines the probability distribution of the possible values f(x) for each point x. These probability distributions are Gaussian, and are therefore defined by a mean (µ) and a variance (σ2). However, µ and σ2 can be different for each x; a Gaussian process therefore defines a probability distribution over functions:\nP (f(x)|x) = N (µ(x), σ2(x)) (1)\nwhereN denotes the standard normal distribution. At iteration t, if the performance [P1, · · · , Pt] = P1:t of the points [χ1, · · · , χt] = χ1:t has already been evaluated, then µt(x) and σ2t (x) are fitted as follows29:\nµt(x) = k ᵀK−1P1:t σ2t (x) = k(x,x) + σ 2 noise − kᵀK−1k where:\nK =  k(χ1, χ1) · · · k(χ1, χt)... . . . ... k(χt, χ1) · · · k(χt, χt) + σ2noiseI k = [ k(x, χ1) k(x, χ2) · · · k(x, χt) ] (2)\nRieffel and Mouret arXiv | 5\nThe matrix K is called the covariance matrix. It is based on a kernel function k(x1,x2) which defines how samples influence each other. Kernel functions are classically variants of the Euclidean distance. Here we use the exponential kernel15, 28, 29, 44:\nk(x1,x2) = exp ( − 1 β2 ||x1 − x2||2 ) (3)\nWe fixed β to 0.15. An interesting feature of Gaussian processes is that they can easily incorporate a prior µp(x) for the mean function, which helps to guide the optimization process to zones that are known to be promising:\nµt(x) = µp(x) + k ᵀK−1(P1:t − µp(χ1:t)) (4)\nIn our implementation, the prior is a second Gaussian process defined by hand-picked points (see the “prior” section below).\nTo select the next χ to test (χt+1), Bayesian optimization maximizes an acquisition function, a function that reflects the need to balance exploration – improving the model in the less known parts of the search space – and exploitation – favoring parts that the model predicts as promising. Numerous acquisition functions have been proposed (e.g., probability of improvement, the expected improvement, or the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)28, 43, 44); we chose UCB because it provided the best results in several previous studies43, 44 and because of its simplicity. The equation for UCB is:\nχt+1 = argmax x (µt(x) + κσt(x)) (5)\nwhere κ is a user-defined parameter that tunes the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. We chose κ = 0.2."

    "abstractText" : "Living organisms intertwine soft (e.g., muscle) and hard (e.g., bones) materials, giving them an intrinsic flexibility and resiliency often lacking in conventional rigid robots. The emerging field of soft robotics seeks to harness these same properties in order to create resilient machines. The nature of soft materials, however, presents considerable challenges to aspects of design, construction, and control – and up until now, the vast majority of gaits for soft robots have been hand-designed through empirical trial-and-error. This manuscript describes an easy-to-assemble tensegritybased soft robot capable of highly dynamic locomotive gaits and demonstrating structural and behavioral resilience in the face of physical damage. Enabling this is the use of a machine learning algorithm able to discover novel gaits with a minimal number of physical trials. These results lend further credence to soft-robotic approaches that seek to harness the interaction of complex material dynamics in order to generate a wealth of dynamical behaviors.",
