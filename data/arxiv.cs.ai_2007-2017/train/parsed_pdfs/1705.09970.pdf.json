Program abstraction has been utilized to great effect for analyzing deterministic programs. At the heart of program abstraction is the relationship between a concrete program, which is difficult to analyze, and an abstract program, which is more tractable. Program abstractions, however, are typically not probabilistic. We generalize non-deterministic program abstractions to probabilistic program abstractions by explicitly quantifying the non-deterministic choices. Our framework upgrades key definitions and properties of abstractions to the probabilistic context. We also discuss preliminary ideas for performing inference on probabilistic abstractions and general probabilistic programs."

      "text" : "Program abstractions are a richly studied method from the programming languages community for reasoning about intractably complex programs (Cousot and Cousot, 1977). An abstraction is typically an over-approximation to a program: any execution that is possible in the original program is contained within the abstraction. Over-approximation allows abstractions to be used to prove program invariants: any property of all executions in the abstraction is also true of all executions in the original program. To achieve this goal while being more tractable than the concrete program, abstractions work on a simplified domain. The abstraction selectively models particular aspects of the original program while utilizing non-determinism to conservatively model the rest.\nNon-deterministic abstractions are useful for verifying\nproperties such as reachability in a concrete program. However, abstractions are decidedly not probabilistic: they are concerned with the possible, not the probable. Therefore, they fail to support more nuanced queries such as probabilistic reachability, or probabilistic program inference. We seek to enhance the program abstraction framework by explicitly quantifying the non-deterministic choices made in the abstraction, turning the program abstraction into a probabilistic model. That is, our probabilistic abstractions are themselves probabilistic programs, which have been the subject of intense study recently (e.g., Goodman et al. (2008); Fierens et al. (2013); Wood et al. (2014); Carpenter et al. (2016)).\nThe key contribution of this paper is the development of a foundational theory for probabilistic program abstractions. We define probabilistic abstractions as a natural generalization of traditional abstractions, using random variables as the abstraction mechanism instead of nondeterminism. We also formalize the relationship between a probabilistic abstraction and a concrete program, again generalizing from the non-deterministic setting. This includes semantics in both the concrete and abstract domain, the connection between these semantics, and the notion of a sound probabilistic over-approximation.\nA well-known construction of non-deterministic program abstractions is that of a predicate abstraction (Graf and Saïdi, 1997; Ball et al., 2001). It induces an abstraction relative to a given set of Boolean predicates about the program state. We define probabilistic predicate abstractions, which are represented by a simple Bernoulli probabilistic program, as an instance of our framework, and a generalization of classical predicate abstraction.\nWe conclude with a discussion of ideas for performing inference in probabilistic predicate abstractions, building on model checking techniques from the programming languages community and weighted model count-\ning from the artificial intelligence community. We then discuss how probabilistic abstractions could be used to simplify inference in probabilistic concrete programs."

      "text" : "A concrete program is a syntactic object written C. The semantics of a concrete program,which for simplicity we also denote C, is a function from input states to output states over some concrete domain DC . Concrete states are total assignments to all variables in the concrete domain, which we denote z ∈ DC .\nIn general, the problem of proving that a given program satisfies a desired invariant is undecidable. Advances in theorem proving techniques such as Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers (e.g., De Moura and Bjørner (2008)) render reasoning in many useful theories tractable, yet there exist common program structures that lie outside of supported theories.\nThe framework of abstract interpretation (Cousot and Cousot, 1977) provides a general technique for relating a concrete program C to another program A which we refer to as an abstraction. We describe a specialization of the abstract interpretation framework.\nDefinition 2.1. Abstract semantics of an abstraction. The abstract semantics of an abstraction A, which for simplicity we also denote A, is a function from input states to sets of output states over an abstract domainDA,\nwritten A : DA → 2DA .\nIntuitively, the nondeterminism in the abstract semantics of an abstraction represents uncertainty due to the loss of information in abstracting C to A. We represent this non-determinism as a set of possible abstract states, denoted a ∈ DA. To relate concrete programswith abstractions we introduce two mappings between concrete and abstract states.\nDefinition 2.2. Abstraction and concretization functions. An abstraction function for DC and DA is a function α : DC → DA that maps each concrete state to its abstract representative. A concretization function for DC and DA is a function γ : DA → 2DC that maps each abstract state to a set of concrete states. When applied to sets, γ and α respectively concretize or abstract each element of the set.\nAbstraction and concretization functions are related.\nDefinition 2.3. Compatibility. An abstraction function α and concretization function γ are compatible if z ∈ γ(α(z)) for all z ∈ DC . As an extension, the two functions are strongly compatible if they are compatible and for any a and z ∈ γ(a), we have that z /∈ γ(a′) for any a′ 6= a.\nA predicate domain is a well-studied abstract domain induced by a given sequence of predicates (p1, . . . , pn) about the concrete state. The abstract domain DA consists of n Boolean variables (b1, . . . , bn) and so has 2 n possible elements, one for each valuation to the n variables. For instance, suppose DC consists of a single integer variable x whose value is in the range [−2, 2]. The single predicate (x < 0) induces an abstract domain with two possible states, representing the concrete states where (x < 0) is true and false. See Figure 1 for a visualization. The abstraction function α maps each concrete state z to the abstract state (p1(z), . . . , pn(z)), and the concretization function γ maps each abstract state a to the set of concrete states consistent with it: {z ∈ DC | (p1(z), . . . , pn(z)) = a}. The functions α and γ are strongly compatible for predicate domains.\nIntuitively, an abstraction represents a set of possible concrete programs, which is formalized as follows:\nDefinition 2.4. Concrete semantics of an abstraction. The concrete semantics of an abstraction A, given compatible abstraction and concretization functions α and γ, is a function [[A]] : DC → 2DC defined as follows:\n[[A]](z) = γ ( A(α(z)) ) ,\nwhere γ is applied to each element of A(α(z)).\nUltimately we wish to prove properties about a particular concrete program C by reasoning about some simpler\nabstract programA. From the above definition of an abstraction’s concrete semantics we immediately obtain the following criterion for relating a specific concrete program C to A:\nDefinition 2.5. Sound over-approximation. Let A be some abstract program with compatible abstraction and concretization functions α and γ. The tuple (A, α, γ) is a sound over-approximation of C if for all z ∈ DC , C(z) ∈ [[A]](z).\nIn other words, A is sound for C if the result of any concrete execution of C is contained within the possible concretizations of the result of A executed on the abstracted input. Sound over-approximations can be used to verify safety properties of programs, which intuitively express the fact that certain “bad” things never happen (e.g., no null dereferences will occur). Every safety property can be formalized as a requirement that some set B of “bad” states in the concrete program never be reached. To prove that C(z) 6∈ B for each concrete state z, it suffices to prove that γ([[A]](a)) ∩ B = ∅ for each abstract state a ∈ DA, where A is a sound over-approximation of C.\nIn general, the construction of an abstraction is a careful balance between precision, the fidelity of the abstraction to the original concrete program, and tractability, how difficult the abstraction is to construct and reason about. For abstract predicate domains, adding more predicates to the domain increases precision but also makes the abstraction more costly to produce and analyze.\nThe semantics above treats programs C and A as blackbox input-output functions. Nevertheless, the semantics straightforwardly generalizes to assign meaning to every single line of code in the programs, allowing us to establish a sound over-approximation throughout."

Predicate abstractions are known as Boolean programs: the domain DA = {T, F}n. Safety checking in Boolean programs is decidable: a Boolean program has a finite set of states over a fixed number of Boolean variables, making it decidable to obtain the set of reachable states. Given a concrete program C and a set of n predicates (p1, . . . , pn) over the concrete domainDC , the goal of the predicate abstraction process is to construct an abstract Boolean programA that forms a sound overapproximation of C and is as precise as possible relative to the given predicates.\nWe use the simple program in Figure 2 as an exam-\n1 if(x<0) { 2 x = 0 3 } else { 4 x = x + 1 5 }\nFigure 2: A simple concrete program over an integer variable x.\n1 if(*) { 2 assume({x<3}) 3 {x<-4}, {x<3} = F, T 4 } else { 5 assume(!{x<-4}) 6 {x<-4}, {x<3} = 7 choose(F, !{x<3} ∨ !{x<-4}), 8 choose({x<-4}, !{x<3}) 9 }\nFigure 3: A predicate abstraction of the program in Figure 2 induced by the predicatesx<-4 and x<3.

These formulas represent the most precise information we can know inside the then and else branches respectively, given the predicates in the abstraction. They can be obtained through queries to an SMT solver, assuming that p and the n predicates are all in decidable logical theories; see Ball et al. (2001) for details. The predicate abstraction process translates the above conditional as follows in the Boolean program:\nif (*) {\nassume({p T }) ...\n} else {\nassume({p F }) ...\n}\nHere {pT} is pT but with each predicate pi replaced by its Boolean counterpart {pi}, and similarly for {p F}. The statement assume(ϕ), which is standard in the programming languages community, silently ignores execu-\ntions which do not satisfy ϕ. Note that {pT} and {pF} can simultaneously be true, which allows the execution to nondeterministically take either branch of the conditional.\nIn the program of Figure 2, we know that x<0 is true in the then clause. In Figure 3, the strongest information our abstraction can know at that point is that (the Boolean variable corresponding to) x<3 is true.

In the corresponding point of the abstract program we must simultaneously update the values of all Boolean variables to reflect the update to the value of x. Suppose we want to update the variable {pi}. Let pTi denote the weakest propositional formula over the predicates p1, . . . , pn such that p T i holding before the assignment x = e suffices to ensure that pi will be true after the assignment. Similarly let pFi denote the weakest propositional formula over the predicates p1, . . . , pn such that pFi holding before the assignment x = e suffices to ensure that pi will be false after the assignment. Again an SMT solver can be used to obtain these formulas, leveraging the standard notion of the weakest precondition of an assignment statement with respect to a predicate (Dijkstra, 1976). The predicate abstraction process updates the Boolean variable {pi} as follows in the Boolean program:\n{pi} = choose({p T i }, {p F i })\nHere choose(ϕ1, ϕ2) returns T if ϕ1 is satisfied, otherwise returns F if ϕ2 is satisfied, and otherwise chooses nondeterministically between T and F .\nConsider the assignment statement x = 0 in Figure 2. The abstraction process described above will assign {x<3} in the Boolean program to choose(T, F), which simplifies to just T as shown in Figure 3. More interestingly, consider the assignment statement x = x + 1 in Figure 2. If x<-4 is true before the assignment, then we can be sure that x<3 is true afterward. If x<3 is false before the assignment, then we can be sure that x<3 is false afterward. If neither of these is the case, then the abstraction does not have enough information to know the value of x<3 after the assignment. Hence in the Boolean program {x<3} is assigned to choose({x<-4}, !{x<3}).\nInvariants Multiple predicates that involve the same variable are typically constrained in some way. For example, the predicates {{x<3}, {x<-4}} are con-\nstrained due to the relationship {x<-4}⇒{x<3}. This constraint is an invariant which increases the precision of the abstraction with minimal decrease in tractability. We call this constraint I, and we can enforce it simply by inserting an assume(I) statement after each set of assignments."

Further, because a Boolean program has a finite set of possible states at each point in the program, it can be exhaustively explored via a form of model checking, which conceptually executes the program in all possible ways (Ball and Rajamani, 2000). Model checking produces the set of reachable states at each point in the program, and this information can be used to verify invariants of the original program.\nConsider the Boolean program in Figure 3. All executions of this program end in a state where the Boolean variable {x<-4} has the value F . This implies that x always ends in a value greater than or equal to -4 in the original program in Figure 2. On the other hand, our predicate abstraction is not precise enough to verify that x always ends in a nonnegative value, though that is true of the original program. A different choice of predicates would enable such reasoning in the abstraction.\nSelecting predicates The selection of predicates is clearly a critical component of an effective predicate abstraction. In this work we focus on the definition and construction of probabilistic predicate abstractions given a fixed set of predicates, leaving automated selection of predicates for future work. The programming languages community has developed several approaches to the problem of predicate selection. A common approach is to use a form of counterexample-driven refinement, which iteratively adds predicates until the abstraction is precise enough to prove or disprove the desired property of the concrete program (e.g., Ball and Rajamani (2002)).

In this section we explore the consequences of enforcing invariants on the abstraction.\nAn initial approach to enforcing invariants is to straightforwardly generalize the non-deterministic procedure by inserting observe(I) statements between each assignment, where I is the invariant which must hold over the predicates. For example, for the concrete program x=x+10 with the predicates {x<-4} and {x<3}, we generate the following abstraction:\n{x<-4}, {x<3} =\n({x<-4} ∧ {x<3} ∧ flip(θ1)), ({x<-4} ∧ {x<3} ∧ flip(θ2))\nobserve({x<-4}⇒{x<3})\nA key downside is that the parameters no longer have a local semantics: conditioning correlates the otherwise independent flips. This complicates the probability computation, which now involves a partition function.\nTherefore we present an alternative abstraction construction procedure which preserves the local semantics of the parameters of the abstraction while enforcing invariants over predicates. Consider again the concrete program x=x+10. We generate an abstraction using the same predicates as before. However, instead of simply inserting observe statements, we utilize control flow in order to effectively condition on the previously assigned value:\n{x<3} = {x<3} ∧ {x<-4} ∧ flip(θ1) if({x<3}) {\n{x<-4} = {x<-4} ∧ flip(θ2) } else {\n{x<-4} = F }\nThis abstraction, which we call structurally dependent, updates each predicate sequentially, considering all previous decisions. Each concrete statement is abstracted to several abstract statements which utilize control flow to disallow invalid states. The state {x<-4}∧!{x<3} is guaranteed to have 0 probability without the use of observe statements. Further, the parameters have a local interpretation as a conditional probability: it is not necessary to compute a partition function to compute the probability of a particular predicate configuration.\nFundamentally, these two methods of constructing the abstraction represent different factorizations of the distribution.

During model checking, we treat each flip as an unconstrained Boolean variable.\nFor example, consider the probabilistic predicate abstraction statement {x<4} = {x<4} ∧ flip(θ). We assume ∆ = {x<4} prior to execution of statement. Following this statement, ∆′ = ({x<4}∧flip(θ)) ∨ (!{x<4} ∧ !flip(θ)). See Ball and Rajamani (2000) for more details.\nWeighted Model Counting Whereas model checking is usually concerned with determining whether A can reach a particular state, in probabilistic program inference we are concerned with the weighted sum of reachable states, where the weights are induced by the parameters of the flips in each model. The programming languages community has two primary methodologies for computing the set of reachable states in a Boolean program: (1) knowledge compilation to binary decision diagrams (Ball and Rajamani, 2000), and (2) satisfiability methods (Donaldson et al., 2011). Both of these approaches can be generalized to perform weighted model counting for inference in BERN.\nThe knowledge compilation approach to model checking is already capable of performing weighted model counting due to the nature of the queries efficiently supported by a binary decision diagram (Darwiche and Marquis, 2001), and is used for inference in discrete probabilistic programs (Fierens et al., 2013) and Bayesian networks (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008). The satisfiability approach to model checking can be extended to perform weighted model counting. This problem is #P-hard (Valiant, 1979), but a number of recent approximation methods have been explored (Chakraborty et al., 2013; Belle et al., 2015b; Zhao et al., 2016); see Gomes et al. (2009) for a survey of the subject."

      "text" : "Consider the probabilistic program in Figure 5a and suppose we want to evaluate Pr[[C]](c < 5). We will sketch an approach to doing so using probabilistic predicate abstractions.\nFigure 5b shows a probabilistic predicate abstraction for our original probabilistic program, induced by the predicates {a<5}, {b<5}, and {c<5}. Initially each flip has its own parameter to represent its probability. In\nthe figure, we show particular values for each parameter, which were computed by performing queries on fragments of the original concrete program. For example, the concrete assignment a = unif[0, 10) is abstracted to {a<5} = flip(1/2) by computingPr(a < 5) on this single statement of the concrete program. The other parameters can be learned similarly. The key point is that each of these queries is much easier to evaluate in the original program than the actual query of interest, as they are over smaller fragments of the program.\nNow we show that the abstraction captures enough detail to answer our query precisely. Computing the weighted model count using the approach described in the previous subsection, we see that:\nPrA({c<5}) =\n{a<5},{b<5},{c<5} ︷ ︸︸ ︷\n0.5 · 0.5 · 0.5 +\n{a<5},!{b<5},{c<5} ︷ ︸︸ ︷\n0.5 · 0.5 · 0.25\n+ 0.5 · 0.25 · 0.5 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\n!{a<5},{b<5},{c<5}\n+ 0.5 · 0.75 · 0.25 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\n!{a<5},!{b<5},{c<5}\n= 11\n32 .\nThe result is in fact the answer to the original query.\nIn this way, the inference problem on C is decomposed into two, potentially much simpler, problems: (i) fixing the parameters of an abstraction, and (ii) weighted model counting on the abstraction. There remains considerable theoretical work to formally connect the semantics of the probabilistic abstraction with a probabilistic concrete program, as well as practical work to realize the benefits of the approach on desired applications."

      "heading" : "5 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Probabilistic reasoning and static analysis. Several recent works leverage a probabilistic model to guide refinements of a program abstraction (Grigore and Yang, 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). However, the abstractions\nthemselves are not probabilistic. Gehr et al. (2016) use static analysis of a probabilistic program to decompose the problem of inference along paths, which are then dispatched to specialized integration tools depending on the constraints of each path; this work analyzes the original concrete program and does not rely on abstractions.\nProbabilistic abstract interpretation. Probabilistic abstract interpretation is used to reason about programs with probabilistic semantics, for example to place upper bounds on the probability of a particular path (Monniaux, 2000) or construct Monte-Carlo methods (Monniaux, 2001); this line of work does not explore the connections between abstractions and probabilistic programs, nor does it model concrete programmarginals. However, our work does not reason about unbounded loops. The framework of Cousot and Monerau (2012) is a highly general framework for reasoning about programs using probabilistic abstract interpretation; however, they do not consider the abstraction itself to be a statistical model.\nProbabilistic programming systems. Many systems have been developed within the AI and programming languages communities that tackle the problem of probabilistic program inference, but few utilize abstractions. Systems such as Church (Goodman et al., 2008), Anglican (Wood et al., 2014), Stan (Carpenter et al., 2016), BLOG (Milch et al., 2005), and others directly analyze the concrete program. Weighted model counting and knowledge compilation have been used to perform probabilistic program inference (Fierens et al., 2013); they also do not leverage program abstractions. Several probabilistic inference approaches capture distributions in continuous domains by using Boolean predicates, either as an approximation (Michels et al., 2016) or as an exact representation (Belle et al., 2015a). Finally, program abstraction with the purpose of inference is an instance of approximate lifted inference (Kersting, 2012): the abstract domain groups together sets of concrete states, with the aim of reasoning at the higher level."

      "heading" : "6 CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "Probabilistic program abstractions are currently unexplored territory for aiding in the analysis of programs, despite the popularity of probabilistic programming. We provided a formal framework, derived useful properties, and described probabilistic predicate abstractions techniques. Much theoretical and practical work remains to be done in exploring alternative characterizations, showing relationships between concrete programs and their abstractions, and building practical probabilistic abstraction tools. We hope our framework provides the foundational theory to enable these advances in the future."
