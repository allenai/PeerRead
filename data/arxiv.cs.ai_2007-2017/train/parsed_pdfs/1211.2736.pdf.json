INTRODUCTION\nAn expert (knowledge based) system is a problem solving and decision making system based on knowledge of its task and logical rules or procedures for using knowledge. Both the knowledge and the logic is obtained from the experience of a specialist in the area (Business Expert). An expert system emulates the interaction a user might have with a human expert to solve a problem. The end user provides input by selecting one or more answers from a list or by entering data. The program will ask questions until it has reached a logical conclusion."

It consists of three stages:\n Knowledge acquisition: The process of obtaining the knowledge from experts (by interviewing and/or\nobserving human experts, reading specific books, etc).\n Knowledge representation: Selecting the most appropriate structures to represent the knowledge (lists, sets, scripts,\ndecision trees, object-attribute value triplets, etc).\n Knowledge validation: Testing that the knowledge of ES is correct and complete."

In cognitive science it is concerned with how people store and process information and in AI the objective is to store knowledge so that programs can process it. [4]"

Implicit Knowledge\n Procedural Vs. Declarative knowledge.\n32 | P a g e\nwww.ijarai.thesai.org\nII. KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION TECHNIQUES\nMany of the problems in AI require extensive knowledge about the world. Objects, properties, categories and relations between objects, situations, events, states and time, causes and effects are the things that AI needs to represents. KR provides the way to represent all the above defined things [5]. KR techniques are divided in to two major categories that are declarative representation and procedural representation. The declarative representation techniques are used to represents objects, facts, relations. Whereas the procedural representation are used to represent the action performed by the objects. Some of the techniques for knowledge representation are\n Bayesian Network\n Facts and Production Rules\n Semantic nets\n Conceptual Dependency\n CYC\n Frames\n Scripts\n Neural Networks Hybrid Representation\nIII. HYBRID SYSTEMS\nA hybrid KR system is an implementation of a hybrid KR formalism consisting of two or more different sub formalisms. These sub formalism should be integrated through (i) a representational theory, which explains what knowledge is to be-represented by what formalism, and (ii) a common semantics for the overall formalism, explaining in a semantic sound manner the relationship between expressions of different sub formalisms.[6] The generalized architecture for a hybrid system is given in Fig 1.\nIn general these systems consist of two different kinds of knowledge: The terminological knowledge, consisting of a set of concepts and roles defining a terminology, and the assertional knowledge, consisting of some logical formalism suited to represent general assertions."
    }, {
      "heading" : "A. KRYPTON",
      "text" : "The system consists of two modules: the Terminological Box and the Assertional Box. The terminological box, or module, is based on the KL-ONE language -a representation system based on semantic networks and frames [7]. The KRYPTON has been developed mainly from the work of KLONE. The difficulties in representing assertional knowledge using KL-ONE gives the idea of the integration of a theoremprover and a KL-ONE-like language into a hybrid system. It is basically like a “tell-ask” module. All interactions between a user and a KRYPTON knowledge base are mediated by TELL and ASK operations shown in Fig 2.\nThe most important feature introduced by KRYPTON is the notion of a Functional Approach to knowledge representation [8]: KRYPTON is provided with a clear, implementation independent, description of what services are provided to the user. This Knowledge Level [9] description is\npresented in the form of a formal definition of the syntax and semantics of the languages provided by the two modules along with the interaction between these two modules.\nThe set of primitives of the KRYPTON language vary from one presentation to another presentation of the language. In the complete form, the terminological box includes primitives for: Concept conjunction, value and number restriction on concepts, primitive sub-concept, concept decomposition, role differentiation, role chain, primitive subrole and role decomposition. And the assertional box provides a complete first-order logic language including the usual operators: Not, and, or, exists and for all."

      "heading" : "B. KANDOR",
      "text" : "The basic units of KANDOR are individuals and frames. Knowledge model for KANDOR is given in Fig 3. Individuals are associated to objects in the real world and frames are associated to sets of these individuals. These units are manipulated through the standard representational structures of frames, slots, restrictions, and slot fillers common to most frame-based systems. Each slot maps individuals into sets of values, called slot fillers, Elements of these sets can be other individuals, strings, or numbers.\n33 | P a g e\nwww.ijarai.thesai.org\nFrames in KANDOR have no assertion import; they look simply as descriptions of some set of individuals. There are two types of frames: Primitive and defined. To be an instance of a primitive frame, an individual must be explicitly specified as an instance of the frame when it is created.\nTo be an instance of a defined frame an individual must satisfy the conditions associated to the frame definition. There two types of conditions: Super-frames and restrictions. A super-frame is just another frame, and a restriction is a condition on a set of slots fillers for some slot. An individual satisfies the restriction if its slots fillers for that slot satisfy the condition.\nKANDOR provides two main operations that require inferences to be made: Given an individual and a frame, determine whether the individual is an instance of the frame, arid, given two frames, it determines whether one frame is subset of another frame.\nKANDOR has been used as the knowledge representation component of ARGON [10], which is an interactive information retrieval system which is designed to be used by non experts for retrieval purpose over a large, heterogeneous knowledge bases, possibly taken from a large number of sources or repositories."

      "heading" : "C. BACK",
      "text" : "The structure of a BACK represents as the same structure of KRYPTON, which contains an terminological box and an assertional box. One main aspect in the BACK implementation is the Balancedness of the formalisms involved. Although the fact that the reasoning in hybrid systems is frequently incomplete (because of efficiency requirements) sometimes leads to situations where one formalism allows to express something which obviously should have some impact on another formalism according to the semantics of the system, the incompleteness of the reasoning precludes this impact to be realized by the system. The formalisms of this type of systems are said to be “unbalanced”.\nThe main criteria taken into account in the development of the BACK system [16] are the following: (i) The sub formalisms of the system should be balanced, (ii) the\nformalism should permit tractable inference algorithms covering almost all possible inferences, (iii) the assertional box formalism should be able to represent incomplete knowledge in a limited manner, (iv) the system should allow for extending the knowledge base incrementally (retractions are not considered) and (v) the system should reject assertional box entries which are inconsistent. The terminological language of BACK is more powerful than that of KRYPTON."

These two formalisms are complementary: PENNI is able to represent propositional assertions without any quantification and NIKL allows the representation of a simple class of universally quantified sentences. These sentences can be\n34 | P a g e\nwww.ijarai.thesai.org\napplied in PENNI to extend its propositional language with a limited form of quantification. Fig 4 shows the architecture of KL-TWO [12] .\nThe PENNI formalism consists of a database of propositional assertions, more specifically, a data base of ground sentences of first-order logic without quantifiers. This database permits incremental assertions and retractions. Underlying the deductive mechanism of PENNI is a Truth Maintenance System (TMS) allowing all the useful operations that have been associated with such systems.\nAnd the NIKL terminological reasoner allows the definition of composite concepts and roles through the use of structuring primitives and primitive concepts and roles. The primitives available in NIKL include: Concept conjunction, statement of the minimal number of role fillers, concept value restriction and role differentiation. The inference provided by NIKL is basically the sub assumption relation between concepts. It has been proved recently that the subsumption problem in NIKL is undecidable.\nTwo forms of hybrid reasoning are performed by the KLTWO system: The forward reasoning, which is used to classify new assertions according to the concepts already defined in the NIKL knowledge base, and the backward reasoning, used to answer queries. Both mechanisms combine the inferences mechanism of PENNI and NIKL to perform their tasks"

CAKE does not present complementary representation formalisms in which different types of knowledge are represented, but it uses its two formalisms to represent the same knowledge.\nThe two formalisms present in CAKE are: A predicate calculus package which is based on the RUP (Reasoning Utility Package) system and a specialized, semantic network like formalism which is used to represent the structure of programs. This last formalism, called Plan Diagrams or simply Plans, was developed without any special concern about formal semantics but was only designed to fit the requirements of the program representation problem.\nThe current architecture of CAKE consists of eight layers: The bottom five layers forming the predicate calculus level and the top three layers corresponding to the Plan level. The predicate calculus layers, from bottom to top, and their functions are the following: (i) Truth Maintenance, unit propositional resolution, retraction and explanation, (ii) Equality, uniqueness of terms, congruence closure, (iii) Demons, pattern directed invocation, priority queues, (iv) Algebraic, commutativity, associativity, etc, lattices, Boolean\nalgebras, (v) Types, type inheritance and functionality. The Plan layers are the following: (i) Plan Calculus, data and control flow graphs, abstract data types, (ii) Plan Recognition, flow graph parsing and recognition heuristics, (iii) Plan Synthesis, search of refinement space and synthesis heuristics."

The system can\nalso interface with a rule-based system. Its semantics uses\na three-valued semantics that is extended to seven values\nwhen defaults are included.\n The QUARK system developed at the University of Hamburg (FRG), includes a Hom clauses interpreter, and\na terminological reasoner in the KL-ONE tradition. Its\nsemantics is defined using the four-valued approach. The\nsystem is organized around nodes called Denotasional\nEntities (DE), and the set of facts associated to these DEs, called aggregates. The aggregates correspond to the frame\nentities in other systems, and are organized into a\nnetwork.\n The CLASSIC system is a direct descendent of the KANDOR system, and shares all functionalities with this\nsystem. The goal of a CLASSIC hybrid system is to extend the expressive power of KANDOR's\nterminological language while remaining tractable. Along\nwith the functionalities of the KANDOR system, it\nincludes\n(a) a construct to allow equalities between role fillers, (b) a set construct to allow one to say a slot is filled by an\nindividual of one of a set of different frames,\n(c) a test-defined construct which allows one to test\nmembership in classes by a user defined test, and\n(d) a limited form of rules which allow one to say that\nonce something is found to be an instance of one concept, then it is an instance of another concept. The system also\nallows host concepts, such as integers, strings, and all\nCommon Lisp structures.\nThe Comparison between different hybrid systems [15] is presented in Table 1.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nDifferent KR schemes are used in AI, which differ in terms of semantics, structure and flexibility in level of power of expression. Combination of two or more representation schemes, which is known as Hybrid Systems may be used for making the system more efficient and improving the knowledge representation. Different hybrid systems are discussed with their corresponding architectures and also presented a comparative data in terms of modules (Assertional, Terminology), Formal semantics and Domain of Applications."
