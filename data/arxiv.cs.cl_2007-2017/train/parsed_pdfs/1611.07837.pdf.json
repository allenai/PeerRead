      "text" : "Videos represent among the most widely used forms of data, and their accurate characterization poses an important challenge for computer vision and machine learning. Generating a naturallanguage description of a video, termed video captioning, is an important component of video analysis. Inspired by the successful encoder-decoder framework used in machine translation (Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014) and image caption generation (Kiros et al., 2014; Vinyals et al., 2015; Karpathy & Li, 2015; Mao et al., 2015), most recent work on video captioning (Donahue et al., 2015; Venugopalan et al., 2015a;b; Pan et al., 2016b; Yu et al., 2016) employs a twodimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder, mapping an input video to a compact feature-vector representation. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is typically employed as a decoder, unrolling the feature vector to generate a sequence of words of arbitrary length.\nDespite achieving encouraging success in video captioning, previous models suffer important limitations. Often the rich video content is mapped to a single feature vector for caption generation; this approach is prone to miss detailed and localized spatiotemporal information. To mitigate this, one may employ methods to focus attention on local regions of the feature map, but typically this is done with features from a selected (usually top) CNN layer. By employing features from a fixed CNN layer, the algorithm is limited in its ability to model rich, context-aware semantics that requires focusing on different feature abstraction levels. As investigated in Mahendran & Vedaldi\n∗Most of this work was done when the author was an intern at NEC Labs America.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n07 83\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n(2015); Zeiler & Fergus (2014), the feature characteristics/abstraction is correlated with the CNN layer: features from layers at or near the top of a CNN tend to focus on global (extended) visual percepts, while features from lower CNN layers provide more local, fine-grained information. It is desirable to select/weight features from different CNN layers adaptively when decoding a caption, selecting different levels of feature abstraction by sequentially emphasizing features from different CNN layers. In addition to focusing on features from different CNN layers, it is also desirable to emphasize local spatiotemporal regions in feature maps at particular layers.\nTo realize these desiderata, the proposed decoding process for generating a sequence of words dynamically emphasizes different levels (CNN layers) of 3D convolutional features, to model important coarse or fine-grained spatiotemporal structure. Additionally, the model adaptively attends to different locations within the feature maps at particular layers. While some previous models use 2D CNN features to generate video representations, our model adopts features from a deep 3D convolutional neural network (C3D). Such features have been shown to be effective for video representations, action recognition and scene understanding (Tran et al., 2015), by learning the spatiotemporal features that can provide better appearance and motion information. In addition, the proposed model is inspired by the recent success of attention-based models that mimic human perception (Mnih et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015). Adaptive spatiotemporal feature representation, with dynamic feature abstraction, involves comparing and evaluating different levels of 3D convolutional feature maps. A challenge is that the features from different C3D levels have distinct dimensions. For example, low-level features provide fine resolution on localized spatiotemporal regions, while high-level features capture extended spatiotemporal space with less resolution. To enable direct comparisons between layers, we employ convolution operations to map different levels of features to the same semantic-space dimension.\nThe principal contributions of this paper are: (i) A new video-caption-generation model is developed, based on two distinct means (“hard” and “soft”) of imposing attention. (ii) Our model empolys the attention to adaptively and sequentially emphasize different levels of feature abstraction (CNN layers), while also imposing attention within local spatiotemporal regions of the feature maps at each layer. (iii) A 3D convolutional transformation is introduced to achieve spatiotemporal and semantic feature consistency across different layers. (iv) The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We call the proposed algorithm Adaptive SpatioTemporal representation with dynAmic abstRaction (ASTAR)."

      "text" : "Early work on video captioning used a two-step approach, employing role-word detection (e.g., subject, verb and object) and rules for language grammar. In such work, the sentence for video description is first split into several parts, each of which is aligned with visual content. For example, Rohrbach et al. (2013; 2014) learn a Conditional Random Field (CRF) to infer high-level concepts such as object and action; in Guadarrama et al. (2013) semantic hierarchies are used to choose an appropriate level of sentence fragments. Statistical language models, learned from large text corpora, are used to translate the semantic representation to a grammatically correct sentence.\nRecent work often develops a probabilistic model of the caption, conditioned on a video. Donahue et al. (2015); Venugopalan et al. (2015a;b); Yu et al. (2016); Pan et al. (2016a) applied a 2D CNN pretrained on ImageNet to video frames, with the top-layer output of the CNN used as features. Given the sequence of features extracted from video frames, the video representation is then obtained by a CRF (Donahue et al., 2015), mean pooling (Venugopalan et al., 2015b), weighted mean pooling with attention (Yu et al., 2016), or via the last hidden state of an RNN encoder (Venugopalan et al., 2015a). These works were followed by Pan et al. (2016b), which jointly embedded the 2D CNN features and spatiotemporal features extracted from a 3D CNN (Tran et al., 2015). However, all of these previous models utilize features extracted from the top layer of the CNN.\nThe proposed model is related to Ballas et al. (2016), but distinct in important ways. The intermediate convolutional feature maps are leveraged, like Ballas et al. (2016), but an attention model is developed instead of the “stack” RNN in Ballas et al. (2016). In addition, a powerful decoder enhanced with two attention mechanisms is constructed for generating captions, while a simple RNN decoder is employed in Ballas et al. (2016). Finally, we use features extracted from C3D instead of a 2D CNN."

      "text" : "Consider N training videos, the nth of which is denoted X(n), with associated caption Y(n). The length-Tn caption is represented Y(n) = (y (n) 1 , . . . ,y (n) Tn\n), with y(n)t a 1-of-V (“one hot”) encoding vector, with V the size of the vocabulary.\nFor each video, the C3D feature extractor (Tran et al., 2015) produces a set of features A(n) = {a(n)1 , . . . ,a (n) L ,a (n) L+1}, where {a (n) 1 , . . . ,a (n) L } are feature maps extracted from L convolutional layers, and a(n)L+1 is a vector obtained from the top fully-connected layer.\nThe convolutional-layer features, {a(n)1 , . . . ,a (n) L }, are extracted by feeding the entire video into C3D, and hence the dimensions of {a(n)1 , . . . ,a (n) L } are dependent on the video length (number of frames). As discussed below, we employ spatiotemporal attention at each layer (and between layers), and therefore it is not required that the sizes of {a(n)1 , . . . ,a (n) L } be the same for all videos. However, the fully connected layer at the top, responsible for a(n)L+1, assumes that a (n) L is of the same size for all videos (like the 16-frame-length videos in (Tran et al., 2015)). To account for variablelength videos, and maintain the same fully-connected layer at the top, we employ mean pooling to a (n) L , based on a window of length 16 (as in (Tran et al., 2015)) with an overlap of 8 frames. The particular form of pooling used here (one could also use max pooling) is less important than the need to make the dimension of the top-layer features the same for feeding into the final fully-connected layer."

      "text" : "For notational simplicity, henceforth we omit superscript n. The t-th word in a caption, yt, is mapped to an M -dimensional vector wt = Weyt, where We ∈ RM×V is a learned wordembedding matrix, i.e., wt is a column of We chosen by the one-hot yt. The probability of caption Y = {yt}t=1,T is defined as\np(Y|A) = p(y1|A) ∏T t=2 p(yt|y<t,A) . (1)\nSpecifically, the first word y1 is drawn from p(y1|A) = softmax(Vh1), where h1 = tanh(CaL+1). Bias terms are omitted for simplicity throughout the paper. All the other words in the caption are then sequentially generated using an RNN, until the end-sentence symbol is generated. Conditional distribution p(yt|y<t,A) is specified as softmax(Vht), where ht is recursively updated as ht = H(wt−1,ht−1, zt). V is a matrix connecting the RNN hidden state to a softmax, for computing a distribution over words. zt = φ(ht−1,a1, . . . ,aL) is the context vector used in the attention mechanism, capturing the relevant visual features associated with the spatiotemporal attention (also weighting level of feature abstraction), as detailed in Sec. 3.2.\nNote that the output of the fully-connected-layer, aL+1, is only used to generate the first word (encapsulating overall-video features). We found that only using aL+1 there works better in practice\nthan using it at each time step of the RNN, as also found in Vinyals et al. (2015); Venugopalan et al. (2015b).\nThe transition function H(·) is implemented with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). At time t, the LSTM unit consists of a memory cell ct and three gates: the input it, forget f t, and output ot gates. The memory cell transmits the information from the previous step to the current step, while the gates control reading or writing the memory unit through sigmoid functions. Specifically, the hidden units ht are updated as follows:\nit = σ(Wiwwt−1 +Wihht−1 +Wizzt), f t = σ(Wfwwt−1 +Wfhht−1 +Wfzzt),\not = σ(Wowwt−1 +Wohht−1 +Wozzt), c̃t = tanh(Wcwwt−1 +Wchht−1 +Wczzt),\nct = f t ct−1 + it c̃t, ht = ot tanh(ct), (2) where σ(·) and denote the sigmoid function and the element-wise multiply operator, respectively. Matrices W{i,f,o,c}, V and C represent the set of LSTM parameters that will be learned (plus associated biases).\nGiven the video X (with features A) and associated caption Y, the objective function is the sum of the log-likelihood of the caption conditioned on the video representation:\nlog p(Y|A) = log p(y1|A) + ∑T t=2 log p(yt|y<t,A) , (3)\nEquation (3) is a function of all model parameters to be learned; they are not explicitly depicted in (3) for notational simplicity. Further, (3) corresponds to a single video-caption pair, and when training we sum over all such training pairs. Our proposed model is illustrated in Figure 1."

      "heading" : "3.2 ATTENTION MECHANISM",
      "text" : "We first define notation needed to describe attention mechanism φ(ht−1,a1, . . . ,aL). Each feature map, al, is a 4D tensor, with elements corresponding to two spatial coordinates (i.e., vertical and horizontal dimensions in a given frame), third tensor index in the frame-index dimension, and a fourth dimension associated with the filter index (for the convolutional filters). To be explicit, at CNN layer l, the number of dimensions of this tensor are denoted nlx×nly×nlz×nlF , with respective dimensions corresponding to vertical, horizontal, frame, and filter (e.g., nlF convolutional filters at layer l). Note that dimensions nlx, n l y and n l z vary with layer level l (getting smaller with increasing l, due to pooling).\nWe define ai,l as a nlF -dimensional vector, corresponding to a fixed coordinate in three of the tensor dimensions, i.e., i ∈ [1, . . . , nlx] × [1, . . . , nly] × [1, . . . , nlz], while sweeping across all nlF feature/filter dimensions. Further, define al(k) as a 3D tensor, associated with 4D tensor al. Specifically, al(k) corresponds to the 3D tensor manifested from al, with k ∈ {1, . . . , nlF } a fixed coordinate in the dimension of the filter index. Hence, al(k) corresponds to the 3D feature map at layer l, due to the kth filter at that layer.\nWe introduce two attention mechanisms when predicting word yt: (i) spatiotemporal-localization attention, and (ii) abstraction-level attention; these, respectively, measure the relative importance of a particular spatiotemporal location and a particular CNN layer (feature abstraction) for producing yt, based on the word-history information y<t. The most straightforward way to generate the attention weights is to employ a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) (Xu et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al.,\n2015) on ai,l, as this corresponds to the ith spatial-spatial-frame location at layer l. However, this has three challenges: (i) the dimension of al depends on layer index l, undermine use of a single MLP for all ai,l; (ii) the features represented in each layer by al are not spatiotemporally aligned (i.e., there is no correspondence between i across layers); and (iii) the semantic meaning of each feature vector ai,l corresponds the convolutional filters in each layer of C3D, which varies across layers. Issue (ii) undermines the ability to quantify the value of attention at a specific spatiotemporal location, based on information from all CNN layers. Issue (iii) implies that the layer-dependent features are in different semantic spaces, which makes it difficult to compare the value of each layer for predicting the next word in the caption and feed the features into the same LSTM decoder.\nTo address this, we seek to map al → âl, where 4D tensors âl all have the same dimensions, are embedded into same semantic spaces, and are aligned spatialtemporally. Specifically, âl, l = 1, . . . , L−1 are aligned in the above ways with aL. To achieve this, we filter each al, l = 1, . . . , L− 1, and then apply max-pooling; the filters seek semantic alignment of the features (including feature dimension), and the pooling is used to spatiotemporally align the features with aL. Specifically, consider\nâl = f( ∑nlF k=1 al(k) ∗Uk,l), (4)\nfor l = 1, . . . , L− 1, and with âL = aL. As discussed above, al(k) is the 3D feature map (tensor) for dictionary k ∈ {1, . . . , nlF } at layer l, and Uk,l is a 4D tensor. The convolution ∗ in (4) operates in the three shift dimensions, and al(k)∗Uk,l manifests a 4D tensor. Specifically, each of the nLF 3D “slices” of Uk,l are spatiotemporally convolved (3D convolution) with ak,l, and after summing over the nlF convolutional filters, followed by f(·), this manifests each of the nLF 3D slices of âl. Function f(·) is an element-wise nonlinear activation function, followed by max pooling, with the pooling dimensions meant to realize final dimensions consistent with aL, i.e., dimension nLx×nLy ×nLz ×nLF . Consequently, âi,l ∈ Rn L F is a feature vector with i ∈ [1, . . . , nLx ]× [1, . . . , nLy ]× [1, . . . , nLz ]. Note that it may only require one 3D tensor Ul applied on each 3D slices al(k) for each layer to achieve spatiotemporal alignment of the layer-dependent features. However, the features from two distinct layers will not be in the same “semantic” space, making it difficult to assess the value of the layerdependent features. The multiple tensors in set {Uk,l} provide the desired semantic alignment between layers, allowing analysis of the value of features from different layers via a single MLP, in the following (5) and (6).\nWith {âl}l=1,L semantically and spatiotemporally aligned, we now seek to jointly quantify the value of a particular spatiotemporal region and a particular feature layer (“abstraction”) for prediction of the next word. For each âi,l, the attention mechanism generates two positive weights, αti and βtl, which measure the relative importance of location i and layer l for producing yt based y<t. Attention weights αti and βtl and context vector zt are computed as\neti = w T α tanh(Waαâi +Whαht−1), αti = softmax({eti}), st = ψ({âi}, {αti}), (5)\nbtl = w T β tanh(Wsβstl +Whβht−1), βtl = softmax({btl}), zt = ψ({stl}, {βtl}), (6)\nwhere âi is a vector composed by stacking {âi,l}l=1,L (all features at position i). eti and btl are scalars reflecting the importance of spatiotemporal region i and layer t to predicting yt, while αti and βtl are relative weights of this importance, reflected by the softmax output. ψ(·) is a function that returns a single feature vector when given a set of feature vectors, and their corresponding weights across all i or l. Vector stl reflects the sub-portion of st associated with layer l.\nIn (5) we provide attention in the spatiotemporal dimensions, with that spatiotemporal attention shared across all L (now aligned) CNN layers. In (6) the attention is further refined, focusing attention in the layer dimension.\nTo make the following discussion concrete, we describe the attention function within the context of zt = ψ({stl}, {βtl}). This function setup is applied in the same way to st = ψ({âi}, {αti}).\nSoft attention Following Bahdanau et al. (2015), we formulate the soft attention model by computing a weighted sum of the input features\nzt = ψ({stl}, {βtl}) = ∑L l=1 βtlstl. (7)\nThe model is differentiable for all parameters and can be learned end-to-end using standard backpropagation.\nHard attention Let mt ∈ {0, 1}L be a vector of all zeros, and a single one, and the location of the non-zero element of mt identifies the location to extract features for generating the next word. We impose\nmt ∼ Mult(1, {βtl}), zt = ∑L l=1mtlstl. (8)\nIn this case, optimizing the objective function in (3) is intractable. However, the marginal loglikelihood can be lower-bounded as\nlog p(Y|A) = log ∑ m p(m|A)p(Y|m,A) ≥ ∑\nm p(m|A) log p(Y|m,A), (9) where m = {mt}t=1,...,T . Inspired by importance sampling, the multi-sample stochastic lower bound has been recently used for latent variable models (Ba et al., 2015; Burda et al., 2016), defined as\nLK(Y) = ∑\nm1:K p(m 1:K |A) [ log 1K ∑K k=1 p(Y|mk,A) ] , (10)\nwhere m1, . . . ,mK are independent samples. This lower bound is guaranteed to be tighter with the increase of the number of samples K (Burda et al., 2016), thus providing a better approximation of the objective function than (9). As shown in Mnih & Rezende (2016), the gradient of LK(Y) with respect to the model parameters is\n∇LK(Y) = ∑\nm1:K p(m 1:K |A) ∑K k=1 [ L(m1:K)∇ log p(mk|A) + ωk∇p(Y|mk,A) ] , (11)\nwhere L(m1:K) = log 1K ∑K k=1 p(Y|mk,A) and ωk = p(Y|mk,A)∑ j p(Y|mj ,A)\n. A variance reduction technique is introduced in Mnih & Rezende (2016) by replacing the above gradient with an unbiased estimator\n∇LK(Y) ≈ ∑K k=1 [ L̂(mk|m−k)∇ log p(mk|A) + ωk∇p(Y|mk,A) ] , (12)\nwhere L̂(mk|m−k) = L(m1:K)− log 1K (∑ j 6=k p(Y|mj ,A) + f(Y,m−k,A)) ) , (13)\nf(Y,m−k,A) = exp( 1K−1 ∑ j 6=k log p(Y|mj ,A). (14)\nWhen learning the model parameters, the lower bound (10) is optimized via the gradient approximation in (12).\nAs an alternative method, one may first produce abstraction-level attention weights βl, followed by generating spatiotemporal attention weights αi, i.e., switching the order of (5) and (6). However, we empirically found that this method provides slightly worse performance (we implemented and tested both) in our experiments, partially due to the increase of the number of parameters."

Sports-1M classification result. C3D outperforms [18] by 5% on top-5 video-level accuracy. (*)We note that the method of [29] uses long clips, thus its clip-level accuracy is not directly comparable to that of C3D and DeepVideo.\nextract C3D feature, a video is split into 16 frame long clips with a 8-frame overlap between two consecutive clips. These clips are passed to the C3D network to extract fc6 activations. These clip fc6 activations are averaged to form a 4096-dim video descriptor which is then followed by an L2-normalization. We refer to this representation as C3D video descriptor/feature in all experiments, unless we clearly specify the difference.\nWhat does C3D learn? We use the deconvolution method explained in [46] to understand what C3D is learning internally. We observe that C3D starts by focusing on appearance in the first few frames and tracks the salient motion in the subsequent frames. Figure 4 visualizes deconvolution of two C3D conv5b feature maps with highest activations projected back to the image space. In the first example, the feature focuses on the whole person and then tracks the motion of the pole vault performance over the rest of the frames. Similarly in the second example it first focuses on the eyes and then tracks the motion happening around the eyes while applying the makeup. Thus C3D differs from standard 2D ConvNets in that it selectively attends to both\nmotion and appearance. We provide more visualizations in\nthe supplementary material to give a better insight about the\nlearned feature.\n4. Action recognition Dataset: We evaluate C3D features on UCF101 dataset [38]. The dataset consists of 13, 320 videos of 101 human action categories. We use the three split setting provided with this dataset.\nClassification model: We extract C3D features and in-\nput them to a multi-class linear SVM for training models.\ntiple nets setting, we concatenate the L2-normalized C3D descriptors of these nets.\nBaselines: We compare C3D feature with a few baselines: the current best hand-crafted features, namely improved dense trajectories (iDT) [44] and the popular-used deep image features, namely Imagenet [16], using Caffe’s Imagenet pre-train model. For iDT, we use the bag-of-word representation with a codebook size of 5000 for each feature channel of iDT which are trajectories, HOG, HOF, MBHx, and MBHy. We normalize histogram of each channel separately using L1-norm and concatenate these normalized histograms to form a 25K feature vector for a video. For Imagenet baseline, similar to C3D, we extract Imagenet fc6 feature for each frame, average these frame features to make video descriptor. A multi-class linear SVM is also used for these two baselines for a fair comparison.\nResults: Table 3 presents action recognition accuracy of C3D compared with the two baselines and current best methods. The upper part shows results of the two baselines. The middle part presents methods that use only RGB frames as inputs. And the lower part reports all current best\nmethods using all possible feature combinations (e.g. opti-\ncal flows, iDT).\nC3D fine-tuned net performs best among three C3D nets described previously. The performance gap between these three nets, however, is small (1%). From now on, we refer to the fine-tuned net as C3D, unless otherwise stated. C3D using one net which has only 4, 096 dimensions obtains an accuracy of 82.3%. C3D with 3 nets boosts the accuracy to 85.2% with the dimension is increased to 12, 288. C3D when combined with iDT further improves the accuracy to\n90.4%, while when it is combined with Imagenet, we ob-"

      "heading" : "C DIMENSIONS AND RECEPTIVE FIELD OF C3D FEATURES",
      "text" : "The dimensions for features extracted from pool2, pool3, pool4 and pool5 are 28×28×N/2×128, 14 × 14 × N/4 × 256, 7 × 7 × N/8 × 512 and 4 × 4 × N/16 × 512, respectively. N is the number of frames of input video. After the convolutional transformation, the dimensions will be all 4× 4×N/16× 512. To prove these features are spatiotemporal aligned, we first provide the receptive field for 3D convolutional layer and 3D pooling layer. Let Y = 3D-Conv(X), where 3D-Conv is the 3D convolutional layer with kernel size 3×3×3. The features indexed by i = [ix, iy, iz] in Y is obtained by convolving a subset of X indexed by j = [jx, jy, jz] with convolutional kernel, where jx ∈ [ix−1, ix, ix+1], jy ∈ [iy − 1, iy, iy + 1] and jz ∈ [iz − 1, iz, iz + 1]. Then, we call that the receptive field of i = [ix, iy, iz] in Y is [ix−1, . . . , ix+1]× [iy−1, . . . , iy+1]× [iz−1, . . . , iz+1] in X. Similarly, if Y = 3D-pooling(X) with pooling ratio 2 × 2 × 2, the receptive field of i = [ix, iy, iz] in Y is [2ix − 1, 2ix]× [2iy − 1, 2iy]× [2iz − 1, 2iz] in X. We then provide the receptive field of features al from each layer in the input video in Table 3 and receptive field of features after convolutional transformation, âl, in the original feature al in Tabel 4. The features are all indexed by i = [ix, iy, iz]. Combining Table 3 and Tabel 4, we can find the receptive field of âl indexed by i = [ix, iy, iz] for all l in the input video are all [32ix − 63, . . . , 32ix + 30]× [32iy − 63, . . . , 32iy + 30]× [16iz − 32, . . . , 16iz + 15]. We index the top-left element in the first frame as [1, 1, 1]. Note that the index of receptive field could be negative due to padding.\nTable 3: Receptive field of al in input video\nLayer name Receptive field\nPool2 [4ix − 7, . . . , 4ix + 2]× [4iy − 7, . . . , 4iy + 2]× [2iz − 4, . . . , 2iz + 1]\nPool3 [8ix − 15, . . . , 8ix + 6]× [8iy − 15, . . . , 8iy + 6]× [4iz − 8, . . . , 4iz + 3]\nPool4 [16ix − 31, . . . , 16ix + 14]× [16iy − 31, . . . , 16iy + 14]× [8iz − 16, . . . , 8iz + 7]\nPool5 [32ix − 63, . . . , 32ix + 30]× [32iy − 63, . . . , 32iy + 30]× [16iz − 32, . . . , 16iz + 15]"
