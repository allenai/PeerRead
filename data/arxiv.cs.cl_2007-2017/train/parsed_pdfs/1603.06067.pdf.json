      "text" : "Representing words and phrases in a vector space has proven effective in a variety of language processing tasks (Pham et al., 2015; Sutskever et al., 2014). In most of the previous work, phrase embeddings are computed from word embeddings by using various kinds of composition functions. Such composed embeddings are called compositional embeddings. An alternative way of computing phrase embeddings is to treat phrases as single units and assigning a unique embedding to each candidate phrase (Mikolov et al., 2013; Yazdani et al., 2015). Such embeddings are called\nnon-compositional embeddings. Relying solely on non-compositional embeddings has the obvious problem of data sparsity (i.e. rare or unknown phrase problems). At the same time, however, using compositional embeddings is not always the best option since some phrases are inherently non-compositional. For example, the phrase “bear fruits” means “to yield results”1 but it is hard to infer its meaning by composing the meanings of “bear” and “fruit”. Treating all phrases as compositional also has a negative effect in learning the composition function because the words in those idiomatic phrases are not just uninformative but can serve as noisy samples in the training. These problems have motivated us to adaptively combine both types of embeddings.\nMost of the existing methods for learning phrase embeddings can be divided into two approaches. One approach is to learn compositional embeddings by regarding all phrases as compositional (Pham et al., 2015; Socher et al., 2012). The other approach is to learn both types of embeddings separately and use the better ones (Kartsaklis et al., 2014; Muraoka et al., 2014). Kartsaklis et al. (2014) show that non-compositional embeddings are better suited for a phrase similarity task, whereas Muraoka et al. (2014) report the opposite results on other tasks. These results suggest that we should not stick to either of the two types of embeddings unconditionally and could learn better phrase embeddings by considering the compositionality levels of the individual phrases in a more flexible fashion.\nIn this paper, we propose a method that jointly learns compositional and non-compositional embeddings by adaptively weighting both types of phrase embeddings using a compositionality scor-\n1The definition is found at http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/bear+fruit.\ning function. The scoring function is used to quantify the level of compositionality of each phrase and learned in conjunction with the target task for learning phrase embeddings. In experiments, we apply our method to the task of learning transitive verb phrase embeddings and demonstrate that it allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets for compositionality detection and verb disambiguation."

At each iteration of the training (i.e. gradient calculation) of a certain target task (e.g. language modeling, machine translation, or sentiment analysis), our method first computes a compositionality score for each phrase. Then the score is used to weight the compositional and noncompositional embeddings of the phrase in order to compute the expected embedding of the phrase which is to be used in the target task. Some examples of the compositionality scores are also shown in the figure."

The function can be simple ones such as element-wise addition or multiplication (Mitchell and Lapata, 2008). More complex ones such as recurrent neural networks (Sutskever et al., 2014) are also commonly\nused. The word embeddings and the composition function are jointly learned on a certain target task.

Some recent studies (Kartsaklis et al., 2014; Muraoka et al., 2014) have discussed the (dis)advantages of using compositional or non-compositional embeddings. However, in most cases, a phrase is neither completely compositional nor completely noncompositional. To the best of our knowledge, there is no method that allows us to jointly learn compositional and non-compositional phrase embeddings by incorporating the levels of compositionality of the phrases as real-valued scores."

      "heading" : "2.3 Adaptive Joint Learning",
      "text" : "To simultaneously consider both compositional and non-compositional aspects of each phrase, we compute a phrase embedding v(p) by adaptively weighting c(p) and n(p) as follows:\nv(p) = α(p)c(p) + (1− α(p))n(p), (2)\nwhere α(·) is a scoring function that quantifies the compositionality levels, and outputs a real value ranging from 0 to 1. What we expect from the scoring function is that large scores indicate high levels of compositionality. In other words, when α(p) is close to 1, the compositional embedding is mainly considered, and vice versa. For example, we expect α(buy car) to be large and α(bear fruit) to be small as shown in Figure 1.\nWe parameterize the scoring function α(p) as logistic regression:\nα(p) = σ(W · φ(p)), (3)\nwhere φ(p) ∈ RN×1 is a feature vector of the phrase p, W ∈ RN×1 is a weight vector, N is the number of features, and σ(·) is the logistic function. The weight vector W is jointly optimized in conjunction with the objective J for the target task of learning phrase embeddings v(p).\nUpdating the model parameters Given the partial derivative δp = ∂J∂v(p) ∈ R\nd×1 for the target task, we can compute the partial derivative for updating W as follows:\nδα = α(p)(1 − α(p)){δp · (c(p)−n(p))} (4)\n∂J\n∂W = δαφ(p). (5)\nIf φ(p) is not constructed by static features but is computed by a feature learning model such as neural networks, we can propagate the error term δα into the feature learning model by the following equation:\n∂J\n∂φ(p) = δαW . (6)\nWhen we use only static features, as in this work, we can simply compute the partial derivatives of J with respect to c(p) and n(p) as follows:\n∂J\n∂c(p) = α(p)δp (7)\n∂J\n∂n(p) = (1− α(p))δp. (8)\nAs mentioned above, Eq. (7) and (8) show that the non-compositional embeddings are mainly updated when α(p) is close to 0, and vice versa. The partial derivative ∂J\n∂c(p) is used to update the model parameters in the composition function via the backpropagation algorithm. Any differentiable composition functions can be used in our method.\nExpected behavior of our method The training of our method depends on the target task; that is, the model parameters are updated so as to minimize the cost function as described above. More concretely, α(p) for each phrase p is adaptively adjusted so that the corresponding parameter updates contribute to minimizing the cost function. As a result, different phrases will have different α(p) values depending on their compositionality. If the size of the training data were almost infinitely large, α(p) for all phrases would become nearly zero, and the non-compositional embeddings n(p) are dominantly used (since that would allow the model to better fit the data). In reality, however, the amount of the training data is limited, and thus the compositional embeddings c(p) are effectively used to overcome the data sparseness problem."

      "text" : "Acquisition of selectional preference using embeddings has been widely studied, where word and/or phrase embeddings are learned based on syntactic links (Bansal et al., 2014; Hashimoto and Tsuruoka, 2015; Levy and Goldberg, 2014; Van de Cruys, 2014). As with language modeling, these methods perform word (or phrase) prediction using (syntactic) contexts.\nIn this work, we focus on verb-object relationships and employ a phrase embedding learning method presented in Hashimoto and Tsuruoka (2015). The task is a plausibility judgment task for predicate-argument tuples. They extracted Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) and SVO-Preposition-Noun (SVOPN) tuples using a probabilistic HPSG parser, Enju (Miyao and Tsujii, 2008), from the training corpora. Transitive verbs and prepositions are extracted as predicates with two arguments. For example, the extracted tuples include (S, V, O) = (“importer”, “make”, “payment”) and (SVO, P, N) = (“importer make payment”, “in”, “currency”). The task is to discriminate between observed and unobserved tuples, such as the (S, V, O) tuple mentioned above and (S, V’, O) = (“importer”, “eat”, “payment”), which is generated by replacing “make” with “eat”. The (S, V’, O) tuple is unlikely to be observed.\nFor each tuple (p, a1, a2) observed in the training data, a cost function is defined as follows:\n− log σ(s(p, a1, a2))− log σ(−s(p ′, a1, a2))\n− log σ(−s(p, a′1, a2)) − log σ(−s(p, a1, a ′ 2)), (9)\nwhere s(·) is a plausibility scoring function, and p, a1 and a2 are a predicate and its arguments, respectively. Each of the three unobserved tuples (p′, a1, a2), (p, a′1, a2), and (p, a1, a ′\n2) is generated by replacing one of the entries with a random sample.\nIn their method, each predicate p is represented with a matrix M(p) ∈ Rd×d and each argument a with an embedding v(a) ∈ Rd×1. The matrices and embeddings are learned by minimizing the cost function using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011).\nThe scoring function is parameterized as\ns(p, a1, a2) = v(a1) · (M(p)v(a2)), (10)\nand the VO and SVO embeddings are computed as\nv(V O) = M(V )v(O) (11)\nv(SV O) = v(S)⊙ v(V O), (12)\nas proposed by Kartsaklis et al. (2012). The operator ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. In summary, the scores are computed as\ns(V, S,O) = v(S) · v(V O) (13)\ns(P, SV O,N) = v(SV O) · (M(P )v(N)). (14)\nWith this method, the word and composed phrase embeddings are jointly learned based on co-occurrence statistics of predicateargument structures. Using the learned embeddings, they achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on a transitive verb disambiguation task (Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011)."

(2) and (3):\nv(V O) = α(V O)c(V O) + (1− α(V O))n(V O), (16)\nα(V O) = σ(W · φ(V O)). (17)\nThe v(V O) in Eq. (16) is used in Eq. (12) and (13). We assume that the candidates of the phrases are given in advance. For the phrases not included in the candidates, we set v(V O) = c(V O). This is analogous to the way a human guesses the meaning of an idiomatic phrase she does not know. We should note that φ(V O) can be computed for phrases not included in the candidates, using partial features among the features described below. If any features do not fire, φ(V O) becomes 0.5 according to the logistic function.\nFor the feature vector φ(V O), we use the following simple binary and real-valued features:\n• indices of V, O, and VO\n• frequency and Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) values of VO.\nMore concretely, the first set of the features (indices of V, O, and VO) is the concatenation of traditional one-hot vectors. The second set of features, frequency and PMI (Church and Hanks, 1990) features, have proven effective in detecting the compositionality of transitive verbs in McCarthy et al. (2007) and Venkatapathy and Joshi (2005). Given the training corpus, the frequency feature for a VO pair is computed as\nfreq(V O) = log(count(V O)), (18)\nwhere count(V O) counts how many times the VO pair appears in the training corpus, and the PMI feature is computed as\nPMI(V O) = log count(V O)count(∗)\ncount(V )count(O) , (19)\nwhere count(V ), count(O), and count(∗) are the counts of the verb V , the object O, and all VO pairs in the training corpus, respectively. We normalize the frequency and PMI features so that their maximum absolute value becomes 1."

The differences in the trends indicate that our method can adaptively learn compositionality levels for the phrases. Table 2 shows the learned compositionality scores for the three groups of the examples along with the gold-standard scores given by the annotators. The group (A) is considered to be consistent with the gold-standard scores, the group (B) is not, and the group (C) shows examples for which the difference between the compositionality scores of our results is large.\nCharacteristics of light verbs The verbs “take”, “make”, and “have” are known as light verbs 7, and the scoring function tends to assign low scores to light verbs. In other words, our method can recognize that the light verbs are frequently used to form idiomatic (i.e. noncompositional) phrases. To verify the assumption, we calculated the average compositionality score\n7In Section 5.2.2 in Newton (2006), the term light verb is used to refer to verbs which can be used in combination with some other element where their contribution to the meaning of the whole construction is reduced in some way.\nfor each verb by averaging the compositionality scores paired with its candidate objects. Here we used 135 verbs which take more than 30 types of objects in the BNC data. Table 3 shows the 10 highest and lowest average scores with the corresponding verbs. We see that relatively low scores are assigned to the light verbs as well as other verbs which often form idiomatic phrases. As shown in the group (B) in Table 2, however, light verb phrases are not always non-compositional. Despite this, the learned function assigns low scores to compositional phrases formed by the light verbs. These results suggest that using a more flexible scoring function may further strengthen our method.\nContext dependence Both our method and the two datasets, VJ’05 and MC’07, assume that the compositionality score can be computed for each phrase with no contextual information. However, in general, the compositionality level of a phrase depends on its contextual information. For example, the meaning of the idiomatic phrase “bear fruit” can be compositionaly interpreted as “to yield fruit” for a plant or tree. We manually inspected the BNC data to check whether the phrase “bear fruit” is used as the compositional mean-\ning or the idiomatic meaning (“to yield results”). As a result, we have found that most of the usage was its idiomatic meaning. In the model training, our method is affected by the majority usage and fits the evaluation datasets where the phrase “bear fruit” is regarded as highly non-compositional. Incorporating contextual information into the compositionality scoring function is a promising direction of future work."

However, the correlation score is still much lower than perfect correlation; in other words, there are disagreements between the outputs learned with the corpora.

In these cases, the ensemble technique is helpful in improving the results as shown in the examples.\nAnother interesting observation in our results is that the result of the ensemble technique outperforms that of the BNC-Wikipedia data as shown in Table 1. This shows that separately using the training corpora of different nature and then performing the ensemble technique can yield better results. By contrast, many of the previous studies on embedding-based methods combine different corpora into a single dataset, or use multiple corpora just separately and compare them (Hashimoto and Tsuruoka, 2015; Muraoka et al., 2014; Pennington et al., 2014).

The phrase embeddings have proven effective in many language processing tasks, such as machine translation (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), sentiment analysis and semantic textual similarity (Tai et al., 2015). Most of the phrase embeddings are constructed by word-level information via various kinds of composition functions like long short-term memory (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) recurrent neural networks. Such composition functions should be powerful enough to efficiently encode information about all the words into the phrase embeddings. By simultaneously considering the compositionality of the phrases, our method would be helpful in saving the composition models from having to be powerful enough to perfectly encode the non-compositional phrases. As a first step towards this purpose, in this paper we have shown the effectiveness of our method on the task of learning verb phrase embeddings.\nMany studies have focused on detecting the compositionality of a variety of phrases (Lin, 1999), including the ones on verb phrases (Diab and Bhutada, 2009; McCarthy et al., 2003) and compound nouns (Farahmand et al., 2015; Reddy et al., 2011; Yazdani et al., 2015). Compared to statistical featurebased methods (McCarthy et al., 2007; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005), recent methods use word and phrase embeddings (Kiela and Clark, 2013; Yazdani et al., 2015). The embedding-based methods assume that word embeddings are given in advance and as a post-processing step, and learn or simply employ composition functions to compute phrase embeddings. In other words, there is no distinction between compositional and non-compositional phrases. Yazdani et al. (2015) further proposed to incorporate latent annotations (binary labels) for the compositionality of the phrases. However, binary judgments cannot consider numerical scores of the compositionality. By contrast, our method adaptively weights the compositional and non-compositional embeddings using the compositionality scoring function."

The scoring function is used to quantify the level of compositionality of each phrase, and the parameters of the function are jointly optimized with the objective for learning phrase embeddings. In experiments, we apply the adaptive joint learning method to the task of learning embeddings of transitive verb phrases, and show that the compositionality scores have strong correlation with human ratings for verb-object compositionality, substantially outperforming the previous state of the art. Moreover, our embeddings improve upon the previous best model on a transitive verb disambiguation task. We also show that a simple ensemble technique further improves the results for both tasks.",
