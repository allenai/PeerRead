With the \"knowing-value\" operator, we can express knowledge of individual variables, but not of the relations between them in general. In this paper, we propose a new operator Kf to express knowledge of the functional dependencies between variables. The semantics of this Kf operator uses a function domain which imposes a constraint on what counts as a functional dependency relation. By adjusting this function domain, different interesting logics arise, and in this paper we axiomatize three such logics in a single agent setting. Then we show how these three logics can be unified by allowing the function domain to vary relative to different agents and possible worlds. A multiagent axiomatization is given in this case.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 05:16:54 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02048v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yifeng ding"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02048"}
