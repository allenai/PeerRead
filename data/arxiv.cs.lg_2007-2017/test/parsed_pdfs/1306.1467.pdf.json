      "text" : "DOI : 10.5121/ijdps.2013.4303 29\nIn this paper, we focus on the method used in the last category. Viola and Jones have used this method in [4] and their algorithm has proven to be very successful in real time face detection. For learning of the face detection classifier, Viola Jones’ algorithm uses AdaBoost [5] on a training set of approximately 5000 faces and 10,000 non faces. Since the training set and the number of possible features used in learning a classifier is quite large, running time of AdaBoost can be very\nhigh and the time to complete training of one feature can be on the order of several minutes. Thus depending on the total number of features desired, the learning time of the algorithm can be several days. For example, to obtain a 200 feature classifier, it takes about one day on a modern workstation. Thus for applications, where we would like the object detection to be adaptive, this training time needs to be greatly reduced. An example where this is highly desirable is identifying a particular model of a car when it gets stolen, and the traffic cameras need to detect only that model. Since there are tens of thousands of make model and year of cars, waiting for several days until a classifier is ready would not be an option.\nParallel and distributed processing can be employed for speeding up of the AdaBoost algorithm. With the wide availability of multicore workstations and high speed network of workstations, we can take advantage of the computing power available. Software frameworks targeting the efficient use of multiple cores within a workstation have been recently developed for both Windows and Unix/Linux environments e.g., Task Parallel Library [6] allows creation of light weight threads where the cost to launch a thread is only 50 assembly language instructions as opposed to approximately 200 instructions for a regular thread. Further, web services frameworks based on scalable WS* standards are available where efficient distributed implementation can be successfully developed. In this paper, we develop a hybrid parallel as well as distributed implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm exploiting both the multiple cores in a machine via the Task Parallel Library, as well as multiple machines via a novel hierarchical web services based distributed implementation to achieve significant reduction in training time."

      "text" : "A recent work at a parallel and distributed implementation of AdaBoost has been reported in [1]. Their system consists of a client computer and a server pool. The parallelization of AdaBoost is accomplished by using feature blocks. They employ four computing nodes in the distributed model and thus achieve a speedup of only 2.66. Another parallel implementation of face detection has carried out on GPUs in [7] and have demonstrated the improvement in face detection time of the Haar feature based Adaboost algorithm to about 30 frames per second (FPS) using CUDA on the GeForce GTX 480 GPU. The main problem with their work is that they focused on the object detection time, not the classifier training time, so if the training dataset is updated, the training process will be repeated again. Our main focus in this paper is the parallelization of training of the Haar feature classifier to make training process near real-time such that any changes in the feature types or the training dataset can be handled in a short retraining time. The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief background on the AdaBoost algorithm before presenting our parallel and distributed approach in section 3. Section 4 provides the experimental results. Conclusions are presented in section 5."

Five types of features have been used in the original algorithm as shown in Figure 3.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 3. Five rectangular features. Figure (a) shows two rectangles horizontal and vertical features, figure (b) shows three rectangles horizontal and vertical features, and figure (c) shows a four rectangles feature.\nTo calculate the value of each one of the features, the sum of pixels located in the white side of the rectangle are subtracted from the dark side [4]. The window size used for training and detecting purposes in face detection is 24x24. For scaling, the starting point is the smallest size of a rectangular feature, e.g. in three rectangle feature type, it is 3x1 pixels, in a two rectangle feature type, it is 2x1 pixels, etc.. Each rectangular feature is scaled up until reaching total window size of 24x24. As a result, the total number of features for each type is:\n For three rectangle feature type, 27,600 features.  For two rectangle feature type, 43,200 features.  For four rectangle feature type, 20,736 features.\nThe total number for all features combined is going to be: Three rectangles horizontal + three rectangles vertical + two rectangles horizontal + two rectangles vertical + four rectangles = 27600 + 27600 + 43200 + 43200 + 20736 = 162,336 features. During the learning phase, all of these features are going to be computed for all faces in the training set. The set of faces which we use for training purpose is the same one that has been used by Viola and Jones for face detection [4]. The size of each image is 24x24. There are 4916 faces and 7960 non-faces. Thus, the total number of all possible features in all training images is 2,090,238,336 (i.e., number of training images multiplied by features per image). Viola and Jones have used AdaBoost to combine weak classifiers into a stronger classifier [5]. The conventional AdaBoost algorithm works by assigning good features relatively higher weight and the poor ones a smaller weight to determine the best weak classifier [4]. The main goal of a weak classifier is to get the optimal threshold among positive and negative examples for any rectangular feature. This technique has been known as the decision stump. The selected threshold minimizes the number of misclassified examples. The decision of a weak classifier is 1 or 0, i.e., positive or negative. The following equation explains the way a weak classifier works.\nℎ( , , , ) = 1, ( ) <0, ℎ where p is either 1 or -1, is the threshold, and f is the feature."

It needs to go through all features and determine which feature yields the minimum error. Since there are a large number of features, the execution time during the learning phase is high. Our parallel approach speeds up the execution time by efficiently parallelizing the AdaBoost algorithm. We implement a three way approach to get results in shortest possible time. We run main computational part of AdaBoost in parallel using Task parallel Library (TPL). Task parallel library is a built in library in Microsoft .NET framework. The advantage of using TPL is noticed in multi-core CPUs, where the declared parallel workload is automatically distributed between the different CPU cores by creating light weight threads called tasks [6]. To further improve the execution time of AdaBoost, we use web services to run parallel Adaboost on multiple workstations in a distributed manner. Our first level architecture does workload\ndivision based on the feature type. Since there are five feature types, we use five workstations at level 1. As shown in figure 4, total of six machines are used, i.e., one master and five slaves. To achieve further scalability, computation of each of the feature types is further expanded to a second level using web services. Figure 5 shows twenty one PC’s being used, in a two-level hierarchy, Master, Sub-Master, and Slaves."

Since the goal is to find the feature has the minimum error in each group in parallel in each round, five features are selected from five groups. Among them, the feature that has the least minimum error is picked and based on that the weight is updated for the next round of AdaBoost algorithm.

Web Services and Parallel execution on one hierarchal level.  Web Services and Parallel execution on two hierarchal levels. Table 3 shows a comparison of the different approaches we implemented. These results show a significant improvement in speedup as compared to the previous work reported in [1]. We obtain a speedup of 95.1 as compared to a speedup of 2.6 reported in [1]. Figure 6 shows the parallel execution time of our implementation as the number of slaves is increased. With 31 machines, an execution time per feature of 4.8 second is achieved.\nTo be able to predict the speedup for any number of machines available, we develop the following predictive equation for calculating parallel execution time based on the number of nodes in the last level attached to one sub-master node in the middle level (see figure 6 and 7).\n= (0.2 ∗ ) + 0.5\n1000 ∗ ( ) Where is the number of nodes attached to a one sub-master node, and is the maximum number of features allocated to one sub-master node.

We also develop a novel hierarchical web services based distributed architecture for maximal exploitation of concurrency in the AdaBoost algorithm. We demonstrate nearly linear speedup upto the number of processors available to us, and can accomplish the learning of a feature in the AdaBoost algorithm within a few seconds. This may be particularly useful in applications where the classifier needs to be dynamically adapted to changing training set data e.g., in car model detection. In comparison with the previously published work, which used a single level master slave parallel and distributed implementation [8], and only achieved a speedup of 2.66 using four nodes, we achieve a speedup of 95.1 on 31 workstations each having a quadcore processor, resulting in a learning time of only 4.8 seconds per feature. Our future work involves developing a learning framework that can adapt to different object detection needs in a near real time manner."
