      "text" : "We analyze the benefits of unsupervised pre-training in the context of recent deep learning innovations including: rectified linear units, data augmentation, and dropout. Recent work shows that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve state-of-the-art performance for object classification (Krizhevsky et al. (2012)) and object detection (Girshick et al. (2013)), when there is enough training data. However, in many cases there is a dearth of labeled data. In these cases regularization is necessary for good results. The most common types of regularization are data augmentations (Krizhevsky et al. (2012); Dosovitskiy et al. (2014)) and dropout (Hinton et al. (2012)). Another form of regularization, unsupervised pre-training (Hinton et al. (2006); Bengio et al. (2007); Erhan et al. (2010)), has recently fallen out of favor.\nWhile there has been significant work in unsupervised learning, most of these works came before rectified linear units, which significantly help training deep supervised neural networks, and before simpler regularization schemes for unsupervised learning, such as zero-bias with linear encoding for auto-encoders (Memisevic et al. (2014)).\nWe train an unsupervised method that takes advantage of these improvements we call Zero-bias Convolutional Auto-encoders (CAEs). Previous work showed that pre-trained tanh CAEs achieved an increase in performance over randomly initialized tanh CNNs. We conduct this experiment with our zero-bias CAE and observe a larger boost in performance.\nWe analyze the effectiveness of our technique when combined with the popular regularization techniques used during supervised training on CIFAR-10 while varying the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples. We do this comparing against randomly initialized CNNs without any additional regularization. We find that, when ratio is large, unsupervised pre-training provides useful regularization, increasing test set performance. When the ratio is small, we find that unsupervised pre-training hurts performance.\n∗- Authors contributed equally to this work.\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n65 97\nv4 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n1 0\nA pr\n2 01\n5\nWe verify our finding that unsupervised pre-training can boost performance when the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples is high by running our algorithm on the STL-10 dataset, which has a ratio of 100:1. As expected, we observe an improvement (3.87%). When combined with additional color augmentation, we achieve near state-of-the-art results. Our unsupervised regularization still yields an improvement of (1.69%).\nWe will begin by reviewing related work on fully-connected and convolutional auto-encoders. In Section 3, we will present our method and how it is trained both during unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. We present our results on the CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets in Section 4, and in Section 5 we conclude the paper."

      "heading" : "2.1 AUTO-ENCODERS",
      "text" : "One of the most widely-used models for unsupervised learning, an auto-encoder is a model that learns a function that minimizes the squared error between the input x ∈ Rn and its reconstruction r(x):\nL = ‖x− r(x)‖22 (1) r(x) = WTd f(Wex+ b) + c (2)\nIn the above equation, We represents the weight matrix that transforms the input, x into some hidden representation, b is vector of biases for each hidden unit and f(·) is some nonlinear function. Commonly chosen examples for f(·) include the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions. Meanwhile, Wd is the weight matrix that maps back from the hidden representation to the input space and c is a vector of biases for each input (visible) unit. These parameters are commonly learned by minimizing the loss function over the training data via stochastic gradient descent.\nWhen no other constraints are imposed on the loss function, the auto-encoder weights tend to learn the identity function. To combat this, some form of regularization must imposed upon the model so that the model can uncover the underlying structure in the data. Some forms of regularization include adding noise to the input units (Vincent et al. (2010)) and requiring the hidden unit activations be sparse (Coates et al. (2011)) or have small derivatives (Rifai et al. (2011)). These models are known as de-noising, sparse, and contractive auto-encoders respectively. A more recent work by Memisevic et al. (2014) showed that training an auto-encoder with rectified linear units (ReLU) caused the activations to form tight clusters due to having negative bias values. They showed that using thresholded linear (TLin) or thresholded rectifier (TRec) activations with no bias can allow one to train an auto-encoder without the need for additional regularization."

      "heading" : "2.2 CONVOLUTIONAL AUTO-ENCODERS",
      "text" : "While the aforementioned fully-connected techniques have shown impressive results, they do not directly address the structure of images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (LeCun et al. (1998); Lee et al. (2009)) present a way to reduce the number of connections by having each hidden unit only be responsible for a small local neighborhood of visible units. Such schemes allow for dense feature extraction followed by pooling layers which when stacked could allow the network to learn over larger and larger receptive fields. Convolutional auto-encoders (CAEs) combined aspects from both auto-encoders and convolutional neural nets making it possible to extract highly localized patchbased information in an unsupervised fashion. There have been several works in this area including Jarrett et al. (2009) and Zeiler et al. (2010). Both rely on sparse coding to force their unsupervised learning to learn non-trival solutions. Zeiler et al. (2011) extended this work by introducing pooling/unpooling and visualizing how individual feature maps at different layers influenced specific portions of the reconstruction. These sparse coding approaches had limitations because they used\nan iterative procedure for inference. A later work by Masci et al. (2011) trained deep feed forward convolutional auto-encoders, using only max-pooling and saturating tanh non-linearities as a form of regularization, while still showing a modest improvement over randomly initialized CNNs. While tanh was a natural choice at the time, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) showed that ReLUs are more suitable for learning given their non-saturating behavior."

      "heading" : "3.1 UNSUPERVISED PRE-TRAINING",
      "text" : "Our method incorporates aspects of previous unsupervised learning methods in order to learn salient features, yet be efficient to train. Our model is similar to the deconvolutional network in Zeiler et al. (2011) where the cost we minimize at each layer is the mean square error on the original image. However, unlike the network in Zeiler et al. (2011), our method does not use any form of sparse coding. Our model also is similar to that of Masci et al. (2011), however we improve upon it by introducing regularization in the convolutional layers through the use of zero-biases and ReLUs as discussed in Memisevic et al. (2014).\nWe now describe the model architecture in detail. Like the previous work described above, our model involves several encoding modules followed by several decoding modules. A single encoding module El(·) consists of a convolution layer Fl, a nonlinearity f(·), followed by a pooling layer Psl with switches sl.\nEl(x) = Pslf(Flx) (3)\nEach encoding module has an associated decoding module Dl, which unpools using El pooling switches sl and deconvolves with El’s filters, (i.e. FTl ).\nDl(x) = F T l Uslx (4)\nA two layer network can be written as:\nr(x) = D1(D2(E2(E1(x)))) (5)\nWe train each encoder/decoder pair in a greedy fashion (i.e. first a 1 layer CAE, then a 2 layer CAE, etc.) while keeping the parameters of previous layers fixed. Like Zeiler et al. (2011), we compute the cost by taking the mean squared error between the original image and the network’s reconstruction of the input. Thus, the costs for a one layer network (C1(x)) and two layer network (C2(x)) would be expressed in the following manner:\nC1(x) = ‖x−D1(E1(x))‖22 (6) C2(x) = ‖x−D1(D2(E2(E1(x))))‖22 (7)\nWe regularize our learned representation by fixing the biases of our convolutional and deconvolutional layers at zero and using ReLUs as our activation function during encoding. We use linear activations for our decoders. Unlike the work by Memisevic et al. (2014) which analyzes fullyconnected auto-encoders, our work is the first, to our knowledge, that trains zero-bias CAEs for unsupervised learning."

      "text" : "Weight initialization is often a key component of successful neural network training. For ReLU’s it is important to ensure the input to the ReLU is greater than 0. This can be achieved by setting the bias appropriately. This cannot be done for zero-bias auto-encoders. Instead we use two methods\nfor initializing the weights to achieve this 1) in the first layer, we initialize each of the filters to be a randomly drawn patch from the dataset, 2) on the later layers, we sample weights from a Gaussian distribution and find the nearest orthogonal matrix by taking the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight matrix and setting all of the singular values to one. For CNNs we must take into account the additive effect of overlapping patches thus we weight each filter by a 2D hamming window to prevent intensity build-up."

We re-conduct this experiment using a zero-bias CNN trained from a random initialization, and compare it to one pretrained using our zero-bias CAE.\nIn Table 1 we compare the improvements of our model with that of Masci et al. (2011)’s, on various subsets of CIFAR-10. As expected, the\nzero-bias CNN (a ReLU CNN without bias parameters) performs significantly better than the tanh CNN (2.53%, 8.53%, 5.23%). More interestingly, notice that on each subset, compared to Masci et al. (2011) our pre-trained model shows similar or better performance over the randomly initialized CNN. When the ratio of unsupervised to supervised data is high, we experience an 8.44% increase in accuracy as opposed to Masci et al. (2011)’s 3.22% increase."

      "heading" : "4.2.3 ANALYSIS OF REGULARIZATION METHODS",

Specifically, we consider the effects of dropout, data augmentation (via translations and horizontal flips), unsupervised pre-training (with our zero-bias CAE) and their combinations. We compare each regularization technique to a zero-bias CNN trained from random initialization without any regularization (labeled CNN in Figure 2). Figure 2 shows the classification accuracy improvement over CNN for each type of regularization both individually and together.\nWe perform this analysis for subsets of CIFAR-10 with different unsupervised to supervised sample ratios ranging from 50:1 to 1:1, by fixing the unsupervised data size, and varying the number of supervised examples. It is important to note that as this ratio approaches 1:1, the experimental setup favors data augmentation and dropout because the number of virtual supervised samples is larger than number of unsupervised samples.\nIn Figure 2a, where the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples is 50:1, there are three notable effects: (i) unsupervised pre-training alone yields a larger improvement (4.09%) than data augmentation (2.67%) or dropout (0.59%), (ii) when unsupervised pre-training is combined with either data augmentation or dropout, the improvement is greater than the sum of the individual contributions, (iii) we experience the largest gains (15.86%) when we combine all three forms of regularization.\nWe see that effect (ii) is also observed in the case where the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples is 10:1 (Figure 2b), and to a lesser extent when the ratio is 5:1 (Figure 2c). Unfortunately, effects (i) and (iii) are not observed when the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples decreases. We will elaborate on effect (i) below.\nIn Figure 3, we observe that the improvement in performance from unsupervised learning decreases rapidly as the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples decreases. Surprisingly, when the ratio is 1:1, we see that unsupervised learning actually hurts performance (-0.67%)."

From the CIFAR-10 experiments, it is clear unsupervised pre-training can be beneficial if the unsupervised dataset is much larger than the supervised dataset. STL-10 was designed with this in mind, and has a ratio of unsupervised to supervised data of 100:1. So we experimentally show this benefit.\nWe design our network to have structure similar to Dosovitskiy et al. (2014), to ease comparison. The network used consists 3 convolutional layers with 64, 128, and 256 filters in each layer, a fully-connected layer with 512 units, and a softmax layer with 10 output units. We also apply maxpooling layers of size 2x2 after the first two convolutional layers and quadrant pooling after the third convolutional layer.\nWe train the zero-bias CAE on 100,000 unlabeled images. We then fine-tune the network on each of the 10 provided splits of training set, each consisting of 1000 samples (100 samples per class), and evaluate all of them on the test set. The accuracies are subsequently averaged to obtain the final recognition accuracy. Similar to our CIFAR-10 experiments, we also train a zero-bias CNN with the same structure as our zero-bias CAE on each of the splits to further highlight the benefits of unsupervised learning.\nTable 3 presents our results on the STL10 dataset and compares them with other methods.

They do not perform these augmentations during supervised training, but during a discriminative unsupervised feature learning period. We test the regularizing effects of these additional augmentations when applied directly to supervised training, and test how these regularization effects hold up when combined with with unsupervised pre-training. To do this, we use some of these additional data-augmentations during our supervised training: color augmentation and contrast augmentation.\nColor augmentation: The images are represented in HSV color space (h, s, v). Here we generate a single random number for each image and add it to the hue value for each pixel like so:\na ∼ Uniform(−0.1, 0.1) (8) h = h+ a (9)\nContrast augmentation: Here we generate six random numbers for each image, with the following distributions:\na, d ∼ Uniform(0.7, 1.4) (10) b, e ∼ Uniform(0.25, 4) (11) c, f ∼ Uniform(−0.1, 0.1) (12)\nAnd use them to modify the saturation and value for every pixel in the image, like so:\ns = asb + c (13) v = dse + f (14)\nWe find that a) additional data-augmentation is incredibly helpful, increasing accuracy by 6.5%, b) unsupervised pre-training still maintains an advantage (1.69%)."

Unsupervised data has been proposed as another way to improve performance. Unfortunately, unsupervised pre-training is not used by state-of-the-art methods leading to the following question: Is unsupervised pre-training still useful given recent advances? If so, when? We answer this in three parts: we 1) develop an unsupervised method that incorporates ReLUs and recent unsupervised regularization techniques, 2) analyze the benefits of unsupervised pre-training compared to data augmentation and dropout on CIFAR-10 while varying the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples, 3) verify our findings on STL-10. We discover unsupervised pre-training, as expected, helps when the ratio of unsupervised to supervised samples is high, and surprisingly, hurts when the ratio is low. We also use unsupervised pre-training with additional color augmentation to achieve near state-of-the-art performance on STL-10.",
