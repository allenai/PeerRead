      "text" : "Economic issues related to the information processing techniques are very important. The development of such technologies is a major asset for developing countries like Cambodia and Laos, and emerging ones like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. The MotAMot project aims to computerize an underresourced language: Khmer. This language is spoken mainly in Cambodia. As indicated by V. Berment in his Ph.D. thesis (Berment, 2004), \"With the development of personal computers and networks, the computer becomes now a tool for writing and communicating in the same way as paper and printing were before. Word processing, email, and even more advanced systems such as dictation or voice synthesis are widely used tools. The idea then is needed than appropriate information technologies tools must be added to traditional means without which the targeted goals can not be achieved any more\". The computerization of a language such as Khmer occupies a central place in this wider context. The main goal of the project is the development of a multilingual lexical system targeted for Khmer. The lexical system has been initialized with data coming mainly from the conversion of the French-Khmer bilingual dictionary of Denis Richer from Word to XML format."

      "heading" : "2.1. Microstructure of the entries",
      "text" : "The microstructure of the monolingual volumes is based on the Explanatory and Combinatorial Lexicography.\nEach entry is based on the vocable. A vocable is either a group of lexies (word meaning) or an idiom. Each entry consists of a headword and a pronunciation, followed by a list of word meaning (lexies). Each lexie is described either by a lexico-semantic formula (Melcuk & Polguère, 2006 ; Polguère, 2006) or a free gloss. For terms, it is possible to describe their domain. Then comes a translation link pointing to an axie (entry) of the pivot volume. It is followed by a list of examples and idiomatic expressions. Finally, a generic field is used to store additional information from reused dictionaries. To cope with different contributor skill levels, the editing interface adapts itself and displays an appropriate granularity of information. For example, a novice contributor will be prompted for a simple gloss to characterize a lexical unit, while an expert linguist will describe a complete semantic formula. Similarly, only specific contributors have access to the list of lexical functions."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.2. Macrostructure of the lexical database",
      "text" : "The macrostructure is composed of a monolingual volume for each language and a central pivot volume. However, in order not to confuse users, they contribute through an interface with a classic view of a bilingual dictionary. Each bilingual link language A ➔ language B added via this interface (step 1 in Figure 1) is actually translated into the background by creating two interlingual links as well as an axie link representing the original translation to finally get: language A ➔ pivot axie ➔ language B (step 2 in Figure 1).\nIf a contributor wants to add a translation link between a vocable Va of language A and a vocable Vb of language B, s/he can establish this link at different levels. The ideal solution is to connect a word meaning (lexie) La of the vocable Va to another word meaning Lb of the vocable Vb. In this case, the link is bijective and Lb is also connected to La (point 1 in Figure 2). If the vocable Vb has not yet defined specific word meanings or if the contributor can not choose between word meanings, s/he can connect directly the word meaning La to the vocable Vb. In this case, a new word meaning Lb is created with a draft level of quality and the link as well as the word meaning are marked for refinement (point 2 in Figure 2).. In the case of reusing existing data, it is often impossible to link information to a specific word meaning. In this case, we add to the end of the vocable Va the information that one of the meanings of vocable Va can be connected to a meaning of vocable Vb but this information will not be added to Vb (point 3 in Figure 2). It will of course be marked as to be refined with emergency!\nWith the pivot macrostructure, if two links language A ➔ language B and language B ➔ language C exist, then it will automatically create a link language A ➔ language C whose level will be marked as a draft and to be revised."

      "heading" : "2.3. Levels for contributions and contributors",
      "text" : "Each information of each entry is assigned a quality level. The levels range from 1 star for a draft (recovered data whose quality is not known) to 5 stars, quality certified by an expert (e.g.: a link translation validated by a sworn translator). Similarly, contributors will be assigned a skill level (1 to 5 stars as well). 1 star is the level of an unknown novice in the community and 5 stars is the level of a recognized expert. Then, when a level 3 contributor revises a level 2 entry, the entry automatically goes up to level 3. Similarly, if the work of a contributor is systematically validated without corrections by other contributors to the next level, it can automatically switch to the next level after a certain threshold (e.g. 10 contributions). To go further, we plan to analyse the work of the contributors. If a person contributes massively eg on a particular area, the system will automatically send regular proposals for contribution in the domain."

This first version of the dictionary was published in spring 2007 and has 13,249 entries. Each entry is composed by a French headword, in some cases a part-of-speech and a list of word senses. Each word sense has a gloss in French and a translation in Khmer. The dictionary was originally encoded in Word format. An example of the original file can bee seen on Figure 3."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1.2. Conversion of the file into XML",
      "text" : "We first converted the dictionary from Word format to a lexical resource in XML format according to the methodology described in (Mangeot & Enguehard, 2013). The Open Document Format has the great advantage of being based on XML. Instead of a conversion, the contents of the XML document has been retrieved, then transformed to obtain what we want. A document in ODF format is actually a zip archive containing multiple files including the text content in XML. This content is stored in the “content.xml” file in the archive. To retrieve this file, just follow some clever manipulations. On MacOs, create an empty folder and then copy the .odt file inside. Then, open a terminal and run the “unzip” command to unzip the file. On Windows, you must change the .odt file extension into .zip and then open the. zip archive. The file “content.xml” can now be extracted from the archive and then renamed and placed in another location. It becomes the base file on which we will continue our work. The next step consists in editing this file with a “raw” text editor with syntax highlighting and regular expressions based search and replace. One may first think that since the source file “content.xml” is already in XML, it may be enough to write an XSLT stylesheet to convert the file into an XML dictionary, but the XML used in the source file is completely different from the XML targeted. Indeed, the source file comes from a word processor. It is designed for styling a document and not for structuring a dictionary entry. Therefore, it is finally easier to convert the XML file “by hands” with regular expressions than to write an XSLT stylesheet for automatically converting the source file."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1.3. Tagging each part of information",
      "text" : "All pieces of information were explicitly tagged by replacing the ODF markup by a new “homemade” tagset. Each piece of information is usually distinguished from others in the original file with a different style. Search/replace operations were performed for each type of information.\nThe original dictionary file has tow columns. The French is on the left one and the Khmer on the right one. Each entry has one or several word senses. Each word sense is written on one line and has a khmer translation on the right column. Therefore, each line was tagged with “sens” tag (see Figure 4).\nOn the original Word file, feminine forms of adjectives are separated from the masculine with a comma. The feminine form were separated in order to clearly identify the headword of each entry. The original form of the entry is duplicated in the gloss field. The XML file obtained is a unique volume containing French entries translated into Khmer."

      "text" : "The XML data obtained is then converted into the structure chosen for the MotÀMot project. In files coming from word processors, the data structure is usually implied. New structural elements must be added to move towards a more standardized structure. Concerning standards, Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) (Romary et al., 2004) became an ISO standard in November 2008 (Francopoulo et al., 2009). It suits ideally our goals. As it is a meta-model and not a format, the principle of the LMF model can be applied to the entry structure and keeping our tags without using the LMF syntax (Enguehard & Mangeot, 2013). The entry tag corresponds to the LexicalEntry object; the head tag corresponds to the Form object; The headword tag corresponds to the Lemma object; the sense tag corresponds to the Sense object; The gloss tag corresponds to the Definition object; the refaxie tag corresponds to the Equivalent object (Figure 6). The core meta-model LMF is shown in Figure 5. Unique identifiers are also added to entries and word senses (Figure 6). They will be used afterwards for linking entries."

From each French->Khmer translation, we obtain 2 links : one French->Pivot and one Pivot->Khmer. T h e e n t r y fra.abondant.27.e has 2 Khmer translations: “sɑmbo” & “co̥k-coam”. They were elicited into the 4 following links:\n1. Sense s1 of French entry fra.abondant.27.e linked to Axi entry axi. [fra:abondant,khm:sɑmbo].27.1.e; 2. Axi entry axi. [fra:abondant,khm:sɑmbo].27.1.e linked to Khmer entry sɑmbo; 3. Sense s2 of French entry fra.abondant.27.e linked to Axi entry axi.[fra:abondant,khm:co̥kcoam].27.2.e; 4. Axi entry axi.[fra:abondant,khm:co̥kcoam].27.2.e linked to Khmer entry co̥kcoam. Figure 7 shows a French entry after reification. The axi volume is obtained by gathering all the axies in the same file.\nThe Khmer volume is obtained by gathering all the Khmer entries and by merging them when they have the same Khmer word as headword (at this stage, the comparison is based on the IPA of the Khmer word). Each link to an axie constitutes a sense. The volume will then be sorted by Unicode sort order of the Khmer headword in Khmer writing after the process described in part 4. The French volume contains 13,249 entries; the Khmer volume contains 23,766 khmer entries; the axie volume contains 32,402 axies linking to both a French and a Khmer entry."

The second part is the normalisation of combined letters.

In Khmer, each consonant can be written in two different ways following the composition of the syllable in which the consonant is included. These two variants are considered as two different letters with different Unicode codes. We call the two variants A and B and we tag each consonant with its type. For tagging the type of consonants, several heuristics are applied in the following order:\nIn the original file, Khmer words noted in IPA are separated by the '-' character. This feature was used in the conversion when word beginning and endings require special treatments. Some vowels beginning a word like “a” and “ɘ” are specific Khmer letters.\n- a -a\n- ɘ t - ɘt t\n- ā -a ā\nThe consonant “l” ending a word is a type B consonant.\nl - l B -\nThere are three types of vowels: - some are located after a type A consonant;\nā e A āe\nā o A āo\n- other after a type B consonant;\nu ɘ B uɘ\nō a B ōa\n- the third category can be located indifferently after the two types of consonants.

    "abstractText" : "Economic issues related to the information processing techniques are very important. The development of such technologies is a major asset for developing countries like Cambodia and Laos, and emerging ones like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. The MotAMot project aims to computerize an under-resourced language: Khmer, spoken mainly in Cambodia. The main goal of the project is the development of a multilingual lexical system targeted for Khmer. The macrostructure is a pivot one with each word sense of each language linked to a pivot axi. The microstructure comes from a simplification of the explanatory and combinatory dictionary. The lexical system has been initialized with data coming mainly from the conversion of the French-Khmer bilingual dictionary of Denis Richer from Word to XML format. The French part was completed with pronunciation and parts-of-speech coming from the FeM French-english-Malay dictionary. The Khmer headwords noted in IPA in the Richer dictionary were converted to Khmer writing with OpenFST, a finite state transducer tool. The resulting resource is available online for lookup, editing, download and remote programming via a REST API on a Jibiki platform.",
