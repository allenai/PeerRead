      "text" : "Deep learning refers to a subfield of machine learning that is based on learning levels of representations, corresponding to a hierarchy of features, factors or concepts, where higher-lever concepts are defined from lower-lever ones, and the same lower-lever concepts can help to define many higher-lever concepts. Deep learning is learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction, helps to understand the data such as images, audio and text. The concept of Deep Learning comes from the study of Artificial Neural Network, Multilayer Perceptron which contains more hidden layers is a Deep Learning structure. In the late 1980s, the invention of Back Propagation algorithm used in Artificial Neural Network brings hope to machine learning and creates a trend of machine learning based on statistical models. In the 1990s, a variety of Shallow Learning models have been proposed such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Boosting, Logistic Regression (LR). The structure of these models can be seen as one hidden node (SVM, Boosting), or no hidden nodes (LR). These models gained a great success both in theoretical analysis and applications. In 2006, Geoffrey Hinton who is the professor of University of Toronto, Canada and the dean of machine learning and his students Ruslan Salakhutdinov published an article in “Science”, led to a trend of machine learning in academia and industry. The article had two points: 1) Artificial Neural Network with multiple hidden layers has an excellent ability of characteristic learning. The\ncharacteristics obtained from learning have an essential description to data, then facilitate visualization or classification. 2) The difficulties of deep neural network in training can overcome by layer-wise pre-training. In this article, the implementation of layer-wise pre-training is achieved through unsupervised learning. Feedforward neural network or Multilayer Perceptron with multiple hidden layers in artificial neural networks is usually known as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one kind of feedforward neural network. In 1960s, when Hubel and Wiesel researched the neurons used for local sensitive orientation-selective in the cat’s visual system, they found the special network structure can effectively reduce the complexity of Feedback Neural Networks and then proposed Convolution Neural Network. CNN is an efficient recognition algorithm which is widely used in pattern recognition and image processing. It has many features such as simple structure, less training parameters and adaptability. It has become a hot topic in voice analysis and image recognition. Its weight shared network structure make it more similar to biological neural networks. It reduces the complexity of the network model and the number of weights. Generally, the structure of CNN includes two layers one is feature extraction layer, the input of each neuron is connected to the local receptive fields of the previous layer, and extracts the local feature. Once the local features is extracted, the positional relationship between it and other features also will be determined. The other is feature map layer, each computing layer of the network is composed of a plurality of feature map. Every feature map is a plane, the weight of the neurons in the plane are equal. The structure of feature map uses the sigmoid function as activation function of the convolution network, which makes the feature map have shift invariance. Besides, since the neurons in the same mapping plane share weight, the number of free parameters of the network is reduced. Each convolution layer in the convolution neural network is followed by a computing layer which is used to calculate the local average and the second extract, this unique two feature extraction structure reduces the resolution. CNN is mainly used to identify displacement, zoom and other forms of distorting invariance of two-dimensional graphics. Since the feature detection layer of CNN learns by training data, it avoids explicit feature extraction and implicitly learns from the training data when we use CNN. Furthermore, the neurons in the same feature map plane have the identical weight, so the network can study concurrently. This is a major advantage of the convolution network with respect to the neuronal network connected to each other. Because of the special structure of the CNN’s local shared weights makes it have a unique advantage in speech recognition and image processing. Its layout is closer to the actual biological neural network. Shared weights reduces the complexity of the network. In particular multi-dimensional input vector image can directly enter the network, which avoids the complexity of data reconstruction in feature extraction and classification process. Face recognition is a biometric identification technology based on the facial features of persons. The study of face recognition system began in the 1960s, in the late 1980s with the development of computer technology and optical imaging techniques it has been improved; in the late 1990s it truly entered the stages of initial applications. In practical applications, such as monitoring system, the collected face images captured by cameras are often low resolution and with great pose variations. Affected by pose variation and low resolution, the performance of face recognition degrades sharply. And pose variations bring great challenge to face recognition. They bring nonlinear factors into face recognition. And some of the existing machine learning method\nmostly use shallow structure. Deep learning can achieve the approximation of complex function by a deep nonlinear network structure. In this article, we use convolution neural network to solve face recognition. It can overcome the influence of pose or resolution in face recognition. Due to the long training time and the large recognition computing, it is difficult to meet the real-time requirements, or the delay exceeds the range of tolerance. So we use the cloud platform to concurrently speed up the computing process."

CNN is not as restricted boltzmann machine, need to be before and after the layer of neurons in the adjacent layer for all connections, convolution neural network algorithms, each neuron don't need to do feel global image, just feel the local area of the image. In addition, each neuron parameter is set to the same, namely, the sharing of weights , namely each neuron with the same convolution kernels to deconvolution image.\n(the first stage is the input image, the input of the after convolution is the feature image of each layer, namely Feature Map), then add a bias bx, we can get convolution layer Cx. A sampling process: n pixels of each neighborhood through pooling steps, become a pixel, and then by scalar weighting Wx + 1 weighted, add bias bx + 1, and then by an activation function, produce a narrow n times feature map Sx + 1.\nThe key technology of CNN is the local receptive field, sharing of weights ,\nsub sampling by time or space, so as to extract feature and reduce the size of the training parameters.The advantage of CNN algorithm is that to avoid the explicit feature extraction, and implicitly to learn from the training data;The same neuron weights on the surface of the feature mapping, thus network can learn parallelly , reduce the complexity of the network;Adopting sub sampling structure by time or space, can achieve some degree of robustness, scale and deformation displacement;Input information and network topology can be a very good match, It has unique advantages in speech recognition and image processing."

First, we need to train our algorithm. The purpose of this phase is to determine the minimum error which will be used in the next phase. So we must ensure that the algorithm can converge at a certain point. During the training process, the error will be reduced until it becomes a constant. The constant will be used as a threshold in the next step. Figure 1 shows the error will not change after repeating 4 times. So the best error is 4. The horizontal axis represents the number of iterations, and the vertical axis represents error. Seconds, we can use the constant obtained from the first step as the threshold to judge whether the algorithm can stop. Table I shows when the training process is successful the time consumed by the algorithm. In the table, “yes” represents the algorithm is succeed, in contrast “no” represents the algorithm is failed. We can see that the average time used by the algorithm is 12374.3 milliseconds. The reason why the algorithm is failed is it fell into the local optimum."
