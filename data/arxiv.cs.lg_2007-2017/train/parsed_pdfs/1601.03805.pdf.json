      "text" : "Neural networks especially deep networks [13, 19] have attracted a lot of attention recently due to their superior performance in several machine learning tasks such as face recognition, image understanding and language interpretation. The applications of neural netowrks go far beyond artificial intelligence domain, stretching to autonomous driving systems [1, 18], pharmaceutical\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n03 80\n5v 1\nresearch [32, 33], neuroscience [5, 10, 29, 37, 38] among others. Because of its usefulness and tremendous application potential, some open source software packages are made available for research such as caffe [17, 31] and Theano [4]. Furthermore, there are even efforts to build integrated circuits for neural networks [12, 24, 27].\nEvolving from the simplest perceptron [26] to the most sophisticated deep learning neural networks [19], the basic structure of the most widely used neural networks remains almost the same, i.e. hierarchical layers of computing units (called neurons) with feed forward information flow from previous layer to the next layer [6]. Although there is no restriction on how the neurons should be arranged spatially, traditionally they all line in a row or a column just like elements in a vector. The benefit of this is apparently the ease of visualisation of networks as well as the convenience of deduction of mathematical formulation of information flow. As a consequence, vectors are naturally the inputs for the neural networks. This special structure requires the non-vectorial inputs especially matrices (e.g. images) to be converted into vectors. The usual way of vectorising a matrix or multi mode tensor is simply concatenating rows or columns into a long vector if it is a matrix or flatten everything to one dimension if it is a tensor. We are mostly interested in matrices and therefore we restrict our discussion on matrices from now on. Unfortunately this process can be problematic. Firstly, the spatial information among elements of the data may be lost during vectorisation. Images especially nature images have very strong spatial correlations among pixels. Any sort of vectorisation will certainly result in the loss of such correlation. Moreover, the interpretability is heavily compromised. This renders the neural networks as “black boxes” as what is going on inside the network is not interpretable by human operator as the information encoded in the parameters or neurons deviates from the form we would normally percept from the very beginning if we take images as an example. Secondly, the solution space becomes very large which demands very special treatments to the network parameters. There are many adverse effects. First, the chance of reaching a meaningful local minimum is reduced due to large domain for sub-optimum. Second, the success of training relies heavily on human intervention, pretraining, special initialisation, juggling parameters of optimisation algorithms and so on. This situation becomes even worse with the growth of the depth of the networks. This is the well known model complexity against learning capacity dilemma [35]. Third, if the spatial information among elements in matrices has to be utilised by the network, one has to resort to either specially designed connection configuration among neurons if it is possible or priors on the network parameters as regularisation which may cripple back prorogation based optimisation because spatial connection means coupling. For large scale problems e.g. big data, this may not be viable at all. Fourth, the computational cost is very high which requires massive computation platforms.\nTo address the issues discussed above, we propose matrix neural networks or MatNet for short, which takes matrices directly as inputs. Therefore the input layer neurons form a matrix, for example, each neuron corresponds to a pixel in a grey scale image. The upper layers are also but not limited to matrices. This is an analogy to the neurons in retina sensing visual signal which are organised in layers of matrix like formation [25]. It is worth of pointing out that the convolutional neural network (ConvNet) [8, 20] works on images (matrices) directly. However, the major difference between ConvNet and MatNet is that ConvNet’s input layers are feature extraction layers consisting of filtering and pooling and its core is still the traditional vector based neural network. While in MatNet matrices are passing through each layer without vectorisation at all. To achieve this, each neuron in MatNet senses summarised information through bilinear mapping from immediate previous layer units’ outputs plus an offset term. Then the neuron activates complying with the pre-specified activation function e.g. sigmoid, tanh, and rectified linear unit (reLU) [21] to generate its output for the next layer. It is exactly\nthe same way as the classic feed forward neural networks. Obviously the bilinear mapping is the key to preserve matrix structure. It is also the key for the application of simple back prorogation to train the network. This will become very clear after we formulate the MatNet model in the next section. In order not to disturb the flow, we leave the derivation of the gradients to appendix where interested readers can find the details.\nTo demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed MatNet, we will test it in two image processing tasks, the well-known MNIST handwritten digits classification and image super resolution. For digits classification, it is just a direct application MatNet to normalised images with given class labels, where MatNet acts as a classifier. However, for image super resolution, MatNet needs some adaptation, i.e. an “add-on” to accommodate multimodal inputs. As we will show in Section 3, this process is straightforward with great possibility to embrace other modalities such as natural languages for image understanding [40] and automated caption generation [34]. As shown in Section 4, MatNet can achieve comparable classification rate as those sophisticated deep learning neural networks. We need to point out that MatNet is not optimised for this task and the choices of the key network parameters such as the number of layers and neurons are somewhat arbitrary. Surprisingly for super resolution task, MatNet has superior results already in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as the sparse representation (SR) [39]. Once again, this result can be further optimised and we will discuss some further developments that will be carried out in near future in Section 5."

      "text" : "The MatNet consists multiple layers of neurons in the form of (2.1). Let X(l) ∈ RIl×Jl be the matrix variable at layer l where l = 1, 2, . . . , L, L + 1. Layer 1 is the input layer that takes matrices input directly and Layer L + 1 is the output layer. All the other layers are hidden layers. Layer l is connected to Layer l + 1 by\nX(l+1) = σ(U (l)X(l)V (l)T +B(l)). (2.2)\nwhere B(l) ∈ RIl+1×Jl+1 , U (l) ∈ RIl+1×Il and V (l) ∈ RJl+1×Jl , for l = 1, 2, ..., L − 1. For the convenience of explanation, we define\nN (l) = U (l)X(l)V (l)T +B(l) (2.3)\nfor l = 1, 2, ..., L. Hence X(l+1) = σ(N (l)).\nThe shape of the output layer is determined by the functionality of the network, i.e. regression or classification, which in turn determines the connections from Layer L. We discuss in the following three cases.\n• Case 1: Normal regression network. The output layer is actually a matrix variable as O = X(L+1). The connection between layer L and the output layer is defined as (2.2) with l = L.\n• Case 2: Classification network I. The output layer is a multiple label (0-1) vector o = (o1, ..., oK) where K is the number of classes. In o, all elements are 0 but one 1. The final connection is then defined by\nok = exp(ukX (L)vTk + tbk)∑K k′=1 exp(uk′X (L)vTk′ + tbk′) , (2.4)\nwhere k = 1, 2, ...,K, U = [uT1 , ....,u T K ] T ∈ RK×IL and V = [vT1 , ....,vTK ]T ∈ RK×JL . That is both uk and vk are rows of matrices U and V , respectively. Similar to (2.3), we denote\nnk = ukX (L)vTk + tbk. (2.5)\n(2.4) is the softmax that is frequently used in logistic regression [16]. Note that in (2.4), the matrix form is maintained. However, one can flatten the matrix for the output layer leading to the third case.\n• Case 3: Classification network II. The connection of Layer L to the output layer can be defined as the following\nN (L) k = vec(X (L))Tuk + tbk (2.6)\nok = exp(N (L) k )∑K\nk′=1 exp(N (L) k′ )\n(2.7)\nwhere vec() is the vectorisation operation on matrix and uk is a column vector with compatible length. This makes Case 2 a special case of Case 3.\nAssume that we are given a training dataset D = {(Xn, Yn)}Nn=1 for regression or D = {(Xn, tn)}Nn=1 for classification problems respectively. Then we define the following loss functions\n• Case 1: Regression problem’s loss function is defined as\nL = 1\nN N∑ n=1 1 2 ‖Yn −X(L+1)n ‖2F . (2.8)\n• Cases 2&3: Classification problem’s cross entropy loss function is defined as\nL = − 1 N N∑ n=1 K∑ k=1 tnk log(onk). (2.9)\nNote that the selection of cost function is mainly from the consideration of the convenience of implementation. Actually, MatNet is open to any other cost functions as long as the gradient with respect to unknown variables can be easily obtained.\nFrom Eq. (2.2) we can see that the matrix form is well preserved in the information passing right from the input layer. By choosing the shape of U (l), V (l) and B(l) accordingly, one can\nreshape the matrices in hidden layers. In traditional neural networks with vectors input, Eq. (2.2) actually becomes\nx(2) = σ(W (1)vec(X(1)) + b(1)) (2.10)\nwhere x(2) and b(1) are column vectors with compatible lengths. If we vectorise the first hidden layer of MatNet we obtain\nvec(X(2)) = σ((V (1) > ⊗ U (1))vec(X(1)) + vec(B(1))), (2.11)\nwhere A⊗B is the Kronecker product between matrix A and B and we used the identity\nvec(AXB) = (BT ⊗A)vec(X).\nIt is clear that by choosing W (1) in traditional neural networks such that W (1) = V (1) > ⊗ U (1), it is possible to mimic MatNet and it is also true for other layers. Therefore, MatNet is a special case of traditional neural networks. However, V (l) > ⊗ U (l) has significantly less degrees of freedom than W (l), i.e. Il+1Il + Jl+1Jl v.s. Il+1IlJl+1Jl. The reduction of the solution space brought by the bilinear mapping in Eq. (2.2) is apparent. The resultant effects and advantages include less costly training process, less local minima, easier to handle and most of all, direct and intuitive interpretation. The first three comes immediately from the shrunk solution space. The improved interpretability comes from the fact that U (l) and V (l) work on the matrices directly which normally correspond to input images. Therefore, the functions of U (l) and V (l) becomes clearer, i.e. the linear transformation applied on matrices. This certainly connects MatNet to matrix or tensor factorisation type of algorithms such as principal component analysis [15, 23, 41] broadening the understanding of MatNet."

      "text" : "We collect all the unknown variables i.e. the network parameters of each layer here. They are U (l), V (l), B(l) for l = 1, . . . , L, and uk and tbk for the output layer. Write the parameters of each layer as Θ(l). From Eq. (2.2) one can easily see that the information is passing in the exactly the same way of the traditional fee forward neural networks. The underlining mechanism is the bilinear mapping in (2.3), which preserves the matrix form throughout the network. This suggests that the optimisation used in traditional neural networks, i.e. back propagation (BP) and gradient descent combination can be used for MatNet. All we need to do is to obtain the derivative of the cost function w.r.t Θ(l), which can be passed backwards the network.\nSince we proposed both regression and classification network models, the derivatives differ slightly in these two cases due to different cost functions while the back propagation is exactly the same. The details about the gradients and back propagation are in the appendix for better flow of the paper. Once the gradients are computed, then any gradient descent algorithm such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS) [11] can be readily used to find the sub-optimum given an initialisation. Normally, the network is initialised by random numbers to break symmetry. When the number of layers of a MatNet is 3, this strategy is good enough. However, if MatNet contains many layers, i.e. forming a deep network, then the complexity of the model increases drastically. It requires more training samples. Meanwhile some constraints will be helpful for faster convergence or better solution."

      "heading" : "2.3 Regularisation",
      "text" : "Although MatNet has reduced solution space heavily by using the bilinear mapping in (2.3) already, some techniques routinely used in traditional neural networks can still be used to\nfurther constrain the solution towards the desired pattern. The first is the weight decay, i.e. clamping the size of the weights on the connections, mainly U (l) and V (l). Normally we use Frobenius norm of a matrix for this purpose, that is to incorporate\nλ ∑ l (‖U (l)‖2F + ‖V (l)‖2F ),\nwhere λ is a nonnegative regularisation parameter and the summation of Frobenius norms includes the output layer as well.\nOne may immediately think of the sparsity constraint on the weights to cut off some connections between layers similar to the DropConnect in [36]. It turns out that it is not trivial to incorporate sparsity constraint manifested by sparsity encouraging norms such as `1 norm favourably used in sparse regressions [30]. The dropping in [36] in implemented by a 0/1 mask sampled from Bernoulli distribution. Here we discuss another type of sparsity which is much easier to be incorporated into MatNet. This is the situation when we have an over supply of neurons in hidden layers. In this case, the neural network may be able to discover interesting structure in the data with less number of neurons.\nRecall that X (l) n in (2.2) denotes the activation at hidden unit l in the network. let\nρ(l) = 1\nN N∑ n=1 X(l)n (2.12)\nbe the average activations of hidden layer l (averaged over the training set). Through (approximately) enforcing the constraint elementwise\nρ (l) ij = ρ,\none can achieve sparsity in reducing the number of neurons [28]. Therefore, ρ is called a sparsity parameter, typically a small value close to zero, e.g. ρ = 0.05. In words, the constraint requires the average activation of each hidden neuron to be close to a small given value. To satisfy this constraint, some hidden units’ activations must be close to 0.\nTo implement the above equality constraint, we need a penalty term penalising the elements of ρ(l) deviating significantly from ρ. The deviation is quantified as the following akin to Kullback-Leibler divergence or entropy [7]:\nRl = sum\n( ρ log ρ\nρ(l) + (1− ρ) log 1− ρ 1− ρ(l)\n) (2.13)\nwhere sum(M) summing over all the elements in matrix M ; log and / are applied to matrix elementwise. To screen out neurons that are not necessary, we add the following extra term in the cost function of MatNet\nβ L∑ l=2 Rl.\nThe gradient of this term is detailed in the appendix."

      "text" : "We have the basics of MatNet from above discussion. Now we proceed to extending MatNet to multimodal case for image super resolution application. The extension is as straightforward\nas including more than one input matrix at the same time at input layer. Conceptually, we have more than one input layer standing side by side for different modalities and they all send the information to the shared hidden layers through separate connections [22]. It turns out for super resolution, three layer MatNet is sufficient, i.e., input layer, hidden layer and output layer, and it works on autoencoder [14] mode meaning a regression MatNet reproducing the input in output layer. This requires that the output layer has the same amount of modalities as the input layer. Although we showcase only a three layer regression multimodal MatNet, it is not difficult to extend to other type of multimodal MatNet with multiple hidden layers using the same methodology.\nAssumeD modalities as matrices in consideration denoted byXj ∈ RKj1×Kj2 (j = 1, 2, ..., D). Similarly there are D output matrix variables of the same sizes. Denote by X = (X1, ..., XD). In the hidden layer, we only have one matrix variable H ∈ RK1×K2 . The transformation from input layer to hidden layer is defined by the following multiple bilinear mapping with the activation function σ (sigmoid or any other activation function)\nH = σ( D∑ j=1 UjX jV Tj +B) (3.1)\nand from hidden layer to output layer by\nX̂j = σ(RjHS T j + Cj), j = 1, 2, ..., D. (3.2)\nWe call H the encoder for data X . For a given set of training data D = {Xj}Ni=1 with Xi = (X1i , ..., XDi ), the corresponding hidden variable is denoted by Hi. The objective function to be minimised for training an MatNet autoencoder is defined by\nL = 1\n2N N∑ i=1 D∑ j=1 ‖X̂ji −X j i ‖ 2 F . (3.3)\nL is a function of all the parameters W = {Uj , Vj , Rj , Sj , Cj , B}Dj=1. We leave the derivation of the gradients of multimodal MatNet autoencoder to the appendix. It is very similar to those of the original MatNet and therefore the the same BP scheme can be utilised for optimisation."

The network settings are somewhat arbitrary, or in other words, we did not optimise the number of layers and neurons in each layer in these tests. For handwritten digits recognition, MatNet was configured as a classification network, i.e. the output layer was a vector of softmax functions as in Eq. (2.6) and (2.7) of length 10 (for 10 digits). It contained 2 hidden layers, each with 20×20 and 16×16 neurons. As the numbers of layers and neurons were very conservative, we turned off sparsity constraint. MatNet was onboarded with unit norm manifold constraint. Hence we excluded the weights decay. For super resolution task, the only hidden layer was of size 10 × 10, therefore, only 3 layer MatNet.

      "heading" : "4.2 Image Super Resolution",
      "text" : "For image super resolution, we need to use the multimodal MatNet detailed in Section 3. The training is the following. From a set of high resolution images, we downsample them by bicubic\ninterpolation to the ratio of 1/s where s is the target up-scaling factor. In this experiment, s = 2. From these down scaled images, we sampled patches, say 15, from their feature images, i.e. first and second derivatives along x and y direction, 4 feature images for each. These are the modalities from X2 to X5. We also sampled the same size patches from the original high resolution images as X1. See Eq. (3.1). These data were fed into multimodal MatNet for training.\nTo obtain a high resolution image we used the following procedure. First upscale the image by bicubic interpolation to the ratio of s and convert it to YCbCr space. The luminance component is then the working image on which the same size patches are sampled by sliding window as new input X1. Obtain 4 feature images from this working image on which patches are sampled exactly the same way to form X2 to X5. Feed these to a well trained multimodal MatNet to get high resolution image patches from network output. The high resolution patches are then merged together by averaging pixels in patches. This gives us the high resolution luminance image, which is in turn combined with up-scaled, chrominance images, Cb and Cr images, simply by bicubic interpolation, to form final high resolution image in YCbCr space. For better display, it is converted to RGB format as final image.\nWe applied MatNet to the data set used in SR [39], both for training and testing. There are 69 images for training. The patch size was 15× 15. We randomly sampled 10,000 patches altogether from all images for training. Some additional parameters for MatNet are λ = 0.001, ρ = 0.05 and β = 1. So we turned on weight decay and sparsity constraints but left out the manifold constraint. Figure 3 shows the network parameters learnt from the data, from which we can observe the scaling changing filters in the weights for high resolution patches.\nFig. 4 shows the results on two testing images. Multimodal MatNet has comparable performance as SR, the state-of-the-art super resolution method, evaluated by PSNR: for Lena image, multimodal MatNet, SR and bicubic interpolation achieved PSNR 33.966dB, 35.037dB and 32.795dB respectively; for kingfisher image, they had PSNR 36.056dB, 36.541dB and 34.518dB respectively. We applied to a number of images of similar size (256 × 256) and we observed similar scenario. Fig. 5 (a) shows the all the test images, including the two in Fig. 4, and PSNR’s obtained by different methods is shown in Fig. 5 (b). MatNet is very close to SR in terms of PSNR, especially for image 5 and 8."

This has been demonstrated in applications of MNIST handwritten digits classification and image super resolution.\nAs we mentioned several times in the text, MatNet was not specially optimised for the tasks we showed in experiment section.

Then\n∂onk\n∂N (L) nk′\n= − exp(N (L)nk ) exp(N (L) nk′ )(∑K\nk′=1 exp(N (L) nk′ ) )2 = −onkonk′ Combining the above cases results in\nδ (L) nk =\n∂L\n∂N (L) nk\n= − ∂ ∂N\n(L) nk K∑ k′=1 tnk′ log onk′\n= −tnk 1\nonk onk(1− onk) + K∑ k′ 6=k tnk′ 1 onk′ onkonk′\n= onk − tnk.\nFor our convenience, denote\nδ(L) = OK − TK = [onk − tnk]nk ∈ RN×K .\nFinally we want to calculate δ (L−1) n =\n∂L\n∂N (L−1) n\nwhere N (L−1) n is a matrix, i.e., the output\nbefore sigmoid in layer L. In other lower layers, the formulas will be the same as the regression case. From (2.9), we have, noting that N (L) nk = vec(σ(N (L−1) n )Tuk + tbk ((2.6) and (2.7)),\nvec\n( ∂L\n∂N (L−1) n\n) =\nK∑ k=1 ∂L ∂N (L) nk ∂N (L) nk ∂N (L−1) n = K∑ k=1 δ (L) nk diag(vec(σ ′(N (L−1)n )))uk.\nFor each uk, we convert it into a matrix, denoted by Uk, according to the position of elements X (L) n , and formulate a third-order tensor U such that U(:, :, k) = Uk. Then\nδ(L−1)n = ∂L\n∂N (L−1) n = K∑ k=1 δ (L) nk (σ ′(N (L−1)n ) Uk) = σ′(N (L−1)n ) (U×3δ(L)n ) (6.15)\nAgain, according to both (2.6) and (2.7), it is easy to see that\n∂onk ∂uk′\n= − exp(N (L)nk ) exp((N (L) nk′ )vec(X (L) n )(∑K\nk′=1 exp(N (L) nk′ ) )2 = −onkonk′vec(X(L)n ). The second case of k = k′ is actually\n∂onk ∂uk =\n(∑K k′=1 exp(N (L) nk′ ) ) exp(N (L) nk )vec(X (L) n )− exp(N (L)nk ) exp((N (L) nk )vec(X\n(L) n )(∑K\nk′=1 exp(N (L) nk′ ) )2 = onk(1− onk)vec(X(L)n )\nHence, for each k = 1, 2, ...,K,\n∂L\n∂uk = − N∑ n=1 K∑ k′=1 tnk 1 onk′ ∂onk′ ∂uk\n= − N∑\nn=1  K∑ k′ 6=k tnk′ 1 onk′ (−onk′)onkvec(X(L)n ) + tnk 1 onk onk(1− onk)vec(X(L)n )  = −\nN∑ n=1\n−  K∑\nk′ 6=k tnk′\n onk + tnk(1− onk)  vec(X(L)n )\n= − N∑\nn=1\n[− (1− tnk) onk + tnk(1− onk)] vec(X(L)n )\n= N∑ n=1 (onk − tnk)vec(X(L)n )\nIf we formulate a matrix U = [u1,u2, ...,uK ], then\n∂L ∂U = N∑ n=1 vec(XL)n )[on1 − tn1, on2 − tn2, ..., onK − tnK ]\n= X(L)δ(L) (6.16)\nwhere X(L) = [vec(X L) 1 ), vec(X L) 2 ), ..., vec(X L) N )] ∈ R(IL×JL)×N .\nSimilar to ∂onk ∂N (L)\nnk′ , we have\n∂onk ∂tbk = onk(1− onk) and ∂onk ∂tbk = −onkonk′ (k 6= k′). (6.17)\nSo it is easy to show\n∂L\n∂tbk = N∑ n=1 (onk − tnk), , that is ∂L ∂tb = sum(OK − TK).\nThe entire backpropagation is to combine (6.10) to (6.14), and (6.15) to (6.17)."

    "abstractText" : "Traditional neural networks assume vectorial inputs as the network is arranged as layers of single line of computing units called neurons. This special structure requires the non-vectorial inputs such as matrices to be converted into vectors. This process can be problematic. Firstly, the spatial information among elements of the data may be lost during vectorisation. Secondly, the solution space becomes very large which demands very special treatments to the network parameters and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose matrix neural networks (MatNet), which takes matrices directly as inputs. Each neuron senses summarised information through bilinear mapping from lower layer units in exactly the same way as the classic feed forward neural networks. Under this structure, back prorogation and gradient descent combination can be utilised to obtain network parameters efficiently. Furthermore, it can be conveniently extended for multimodal inputs. We apply MatNet to MNIST handwritten digits classification and image super resolution tasks to show its effectiveness. Without too much tweaking MatNet achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art methods in both tasks with considerably reduced complexity.",
