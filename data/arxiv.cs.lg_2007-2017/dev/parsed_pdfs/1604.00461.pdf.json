      "text" : "Statistical NLP models usually rely on handdesigned features, customized for each task. These features typically combine lexical and contextual information with the label to be scored. In relation extraction, for example, there is a parameter for the presence of a specific relation occurring with a feature conjoining a word type (lexical) with dependency path information (contextual). In measuring phrase semantic similarity, a word type is conjoined with its position in the phrase to signal its role. Figure 1b shows an example in dependency parsing, where multiple types (words) are conjoined with POS tags or distance information.\n∗Paper submitted during Mo Yu’s PhD study at HIT.\nTo avoid model over-fitting that often results from features with lexical components, several smoothed lexical representations have been proposed and shown to improve performance on various NLP tasks; for instance, word embeddings (Bengio et al., 2006) help improve NER, dependency parsing and semantic role labeling (Miller et al., 2004; Koo et al., 2008; Turian et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Roth and Woodsend, 2014; Hermann et al., 2014).\nHowever, using only word embeddings is not sufficient to represent complex lexical features (e.g. φ in Figure 1c). In these features, the same word embedding conjoined with different non-lexical properties may result in features indicating different labels; the corresponding lexical feature representations should take the above interactions into consideration. Such important interactions also increase the risk of over-fitting as feature space grows exponentially, yet how to capture these interactions in representation learning remains an open question.\nTo address the above problems,1 we propose a general and unified approach to reduce the feature space by constructing low-dimensional feature representations, which provides a new way of combining word embeddings, traditional non-lexical properties, and label information. Our model exploits the inner structure of features by breaking the feature into multiple parts: lexical, non-lexical and (optional) label. We demonstrate that the full feature is an outer product among these parts. Thus, a parameter tensor scores each feature to produce a prediction. Our model then reduces the number of param-\n1Our paper only focuses on lexical features, as non-lexical features usually suffer less from over-fitting.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 46\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nA pr\n2 01\n1\n0 1\n0\nϕ =wg ∧wc ∧ u ∧ y\n“see” “PMOD” “telescope”\npostag(g+1) =“DT”\ntelescope see with\nPMOD?\na a girl\nword(c)∧word(g) word(c)∧postag(g) word(p)∧word(g)\nword(c)∧postag(g+1) word(c)∧word(g)∧postag(g+1) word(c)∧word(g)∧distance(g, p) …\nc p g\n0\nbc cts wl Model P R F1 P R F1 P R F1 HeadEmb CNN (wsize=1) + local features CNN (wsize=3) + local features FCT local only FCT global 60.69 42.39 49.92 56.41 34.45 42.78 41.95 31.77 36.16 FCT global (Brown) 63.15 39.58 48.66 62.45 36.47 46.05 54.95 29.93 38.75 FCT global (WordNet) 59.00 44.79 50.92 60.20 39.60 47.77 50.95 34.18 40.92 PET (Plank and Moschitti, 2013) 51.2 40.6 45.3 51.0 37.8 43.4 35.4 32.8 34.0 BOW (Plank and Moschitti, 2013) 57.2 37.1 45.0 57.5 31.8 41.0 41.1 27.2 32.7 Best (Plank and Moschitti, 2013) 55.3 43.1 48.5 54.1 38.1 44.7 39.9 35.8 37.8 Table 7: Performance on ACE2005 test sets.

To predict the “PMOD” arc (the dashed one) between “see” and “with” in (a), we may rely on lexical features in (b). Here p, c, g are indices of the word “with”, its child (“telescope”) and a candidate head. Figure (c) shows what the fifth feature (φ) is like, when the candidate is “see”. As is common in multi-class classification tasks, each template generates a different feature for each label y. Thus a feature φ = wg ∧ wc ∧ u ∧ y is the conjunction of the four parts. Figure (d) is the one-hot representation of φ, which is equivalent to the outer product (i.e. a 4-way tensor) among the four one-hot vectors. v(x) = 1 means the vector v has a single non-zero element in the x position.\neters by approximating the parameter tensor with a low-rank tensor: the Tucker approximation of Yu et al. (2015) but applied to each embedding type (view), or the Canonical/Parallel-Factors Decomposition (CP). Our models use fewer parameters than previous work that learns a separate representation for each feature (Ando and Zhang, 2005; Yang and Eisenstein, 2015). CP approximation also allows for much faster prediction, going from a method that is cubic in rank and exponential in the number of lexical parts, to a method linear in both. Furthermore, we consider two methods for handling features that rely on n-grams of mixed lengths.\nOur model makes the following contributions when contrasted with prior work:\nLei et al. (2014) applied CP to combine different views of features. Compared to their work, our usage of CP-decomposition is different in the application to feature learning: (1) We focus on dimensionality reduction of existing, well-verified features, while Lei et al. (2014) generates new features (usually different from ours) by combining some “atom” features. Thus their work may ignore some useful features; it relies on binary features as supplementary but our model needs not. (2) Lei et al. (2014)’s factorization relies on views with explicit meanings, e.g. head/modifier/arc in dependency parsing, making it less general. Therefore its applications to tasks like relation extraction are less obvious.\nCompared to our previous work (Gormley et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015), this work allows for higherorder interactions, mixed-length n-gram features,\nlower-rank representations. We also demonstrate the strength of our new model via applications to new tasks.\nThe resulting method learns smoothed feature representations combining lexical, non-lexical and label information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several tasks: relation extraction, preposition semantics and PP-attachment."

In this paper, we consider the tensor k-mode product, i.e. multiplying a tensor T ∈ Rd1×···×dK by a matrix x ∈ Rdk×J (or a vector if J = 1) in mode (view) k. The product is denoted by T ×k x and is of size d1 × · · · × dk−1 × J × dk+1 × · · · × dK . Elementwise, we have\n(T ×k x)i1...ik−1 j ik+1...iK = dk∑\nik=1\nTi1...ik...iKxikj ,\nfor j = 1, . . . , J . A mode-k fiber Ti1...ik−1•ik+1...iK of T is the dk dimensional vector obtained by fixing all but the kth index. The mode-k unfolding T(k) of T is the dk × ∏ i 6=k di matrix obtained by concate-\nnating all the ∏ i 6=k di mode-k fibers along columns.\nGiven two matrices W1 ∈ Rd1×r1 ,W2 ∈ Rd2×r2 , we write W1 ⊗W2 to denote the Kronecker product between W1 and W2 (outer product for vectors). We define the Frobenius product (matrix dot product) A B = ∑i,j AijBij between two matrices with\nthe same sizes; and define element-wise (Hadamard) multiplication a ◦ b between vectors with the same sizes.\nTucker Decomposition: Tucker Decomposition represents a d1 × d2 × . . .× dK tensor T as:\nT = g ×1 W1 ×2 W2 . . .×K WK (1)\nwhere each ×i is the tensor i-mode product and each Wi is a ri × di matrix. Tensor g with size r1 × r2 × . . . × rK is called the core tensor. We say that T has a Tucker rank (r(1), r(2), . . . , r(K)), where r(i) = rank(T(i)) is the rank of mode-i unfolding. To simplify learning, we define the Tucker rank as r(i)=rank(g(i)), which can be bounded simply by the dimensions of g, i.e. r(i) ≤ ri; this allows us to enforce a rank constraint on T simply by restricting the dimensions ri of g, as described in §6. CP Decomposition: CP decomposition represents a d1×d2×. . .×dK tensor T as a sum of rank-one tensors (i.e. a sum of outer products of K vectors):\nT = r∑\nj=1\nW1[j, :]⊗W2[j, :]⊗ . . .⊗WK [j, :] (2)\nwhere each Wi is an r × di matrix and Wi[j, :] is the vector of its j-th row. For CP decomposition, the rank r of a tensor T is defined to be the number of rank-one tensors in the decomposition. CP decomposition can be viewed as a special case of Tucker decomposition in which r1 = r2 = . . . = rK = r and g is a superdiagonal tensor."

      "heading" : "3 Factorization of Lexical Features",
      "text" : "Suppose we have feature φ that includes information from a label y, multiple lexical items w1, . . . ,wn and non-lexical property u. This feature can be factorized as a conjunction of each part: φ = y ∧ u ∧ w1∧. . .∧wn. The feature fires when all (n+2) parts fire in the instance (reflected by the ∧ symbol in φ). The one-hot representation of φ can then be viewed as a tensor eφ = y⊗ u⊗w1⊗ · · · ⊗wn, where each feature part is also represented as a one-hot vector.2 Figure 1d illustrates this case with two lexical parts. Given an input instance x and its associated label y, we can extract a set of features S(x, y). In 2u, y,wi denote one-hot vectors instead of symbols.\na traditional log-linear model, we view the instance x as a bag-of-features, i.e. a feature vector F (x, y). Each dimension corresponds to a feature φ, and has value 1 if φ ∈ S(x, y). Then the log-linear model scores the instance as s(x, y;w) = wTF (x, y) =∑\nφ∈S(x,y) s(φ;w), where w is the parameter vector. We can re-write s(x, y;w) based on the factorization of the features using tensor multiplication; in which w becomes a parameter tensor T :\ns(x, y;w) = s(x, y; T ) = ∑\nφ∈S(x,y) s(φ; T ) (3)\nHere each φ has the form (y, u,w1, . . . ,wn), and\ns(φ; T ) = T ×l y×f u×w1 w1...×wn wn. (4)\nNote that one-hot vectors wi of words themselves are large (|wi| > 500k), thus the above formulation with parameter tensor T can be very large, making parameter estimation difficult. Instead of estimating only the values of the dimensions which appear in training data as in traditional methods, we will reduce the size of tensor T via a low-rank approximation. With different approximation methods, (4) will have different equivalent forms, e.g. (6), (7) in §4.1. Optimization objective: The loss function ` for training the log-linear model uses (3) for scores, e.g., the log-loss `(x, y; T ) = − log exp{s(x,y;T )}∑\ny′∈L exp{s(x,y′;T )} .\nLearning can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\nminimize: T\n∑\n(x,y)∈D `(x, y; T )\nsubject to:    rank(T ) ≤ (r1, r2, ..., rn+2) (Tucker-form)\nrank(T ) ≤ r (CP-form)\n(5)\nwhere the constraints on rank(T ) depend on the chosen tensor approximation method (§2).\nThe above framework has some advantages: First, as discussed in §1 and here, we hope the representations capture rich interactions between different parts of the lexical features; the low-rank tensor approximation methods keep the most important interaction information of the original tensor, while significantly reducing its size. Second, the low-rank structure will encourage weight-sharing among lexical features with similar decomposed parts, leading\nto better model generalization. Note that there are examples where features have different numbers of multiple lexical parts, such as both unigram and bigram features in PP-attachment. We will use two different methods to handle these features (§5). Remarks (advantages of our factorization) Compared to prior work, e.g. (Lei et al., 2014; Lei et al., 2015), the proposed factorization has the following advantages:\n1. Parameter explosion when mapping a view with lexical properties to its representation vector (as will be discussed in 4.3): Our factorization allows the model to treat word embeddings as inputs to the views of lexical parts, dramatically reducing the parameters. Prior work cannot do this since its views are mixtures of lexical and non-lexical properties. Note that Lei et al. (2014) uses embeddings by concatenating them to specific views, which increases dimensionality, but the improvement is limited.\n2. No weight-sharing among conjunctions with same lexical property, like the child-word “word(c)” and its conjunction with head-postag “word(c) ∧ word(g)” in Figure 1(b). The factorization in prior work treats them as independent features, greatly increasing the dimensionality. Our factorization builds representations of both features based on the embedding of “word(c)”, thus utilizing their connections and reducing the dimensionality.\nThe above advantages are also key to overcome the problems of prior work mentioned at the end of §1."

      "text" : "Using one-hot encodings for each of the parts of feature φ results in a very large tensor. This section shows how to compute the score in (4) without constructing the full feature tensor using two tensor approximation methods (§4.1 and §4.2).\nWe begin with some intuition. To score the original (full rank) tensor representation of φ, we need a parameter tensor T of size d1 × d2 × . . . × dn+2, where d3 = · · · = dn+2 = |V | is the vocabulary size, n is the number of lexical parts in the feature\nand d1 = |L| and d2 = |F | are the number of different labels and non-lexical properties, respectively. (§5 will handle n varying across features.) Our methods reduce the tensor size by embedding each part of φ into a lower dimensional space, where we represent each label, non-lexical property and words with an r1, r2, r3, . . . , rn+2 dimensional vector respectively (ri di, ∀i). These embedded features can then be scored by much smaller tensors. We denote the above transformations as matrices Wl ∈ Rr1×d1 , Wf ∈ Rr2×d2 , Wi ∈ Rri+2×di+2 for i = 1, . . . , n, and write corresponding lowdimensional hidden representations as h(l)y = Wly, h (f) u = Wfu and h (i) w = Wiw.\nIn our methods, the above transformations of embeddings are parts of low-rank tensors as in (5), so the embeddings of non-lexical properties and labels can be trained simultaneously with the low-rank tensors. Note that for one-hot input encodings the transformation matrices are essentially lookup tables, making the computation of these transformations sufficiently fast."

      "text" : "One of the computational and statistical bottlenecks in learning these LRFRn models is the vocabulary size; the number of parameters to learn in each matrix Wi scales linearly with |V | and would require very large sets of labeled training data. To alleviate this problem, we use pre-trained continuous word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) as input embeddings rather than the one-hot word encodings. We denote the m-dimensional word embeddings by ew; so the transformation matrices Wi for the lexical parts are of size ri ×m where m |V |.\nWe note that when sufficiently large labeled data is available, our model allows for fine-tuning the pre-trained word embeddings to improve the expressive strength of the model, as is common with deep network models.\nRemarks Our LRFRs introduce embeddings for non-lexical properties and labels, making them better suit the common setting in NLP: rich linguistic properties; and large label sets such as open-domain tasks (Hoffmann et al., 2010). The LRFR-CP better suits n-gram features, since when n increases 1, the only new parameters are the corresponding Wi. It is also very efficient during prediction (O(nr)), since the cost of transformations can be ignored with the help of look-up tables and pre-computing.\n5 Learning Representations for n-gram Lexical Features of Mixed Lengths\nFor features with n lexical parts, we can train an LRFRn model to obtain their representations. However, we often have features of varying n (e.g. both unigrams (n=1) and bigrams (n=2) as in Figure 1).\nWe require representations for features with arbitrary different n simultaneously.\nWe propose two solutions. The first is a straightforward solution based on our framework, which handles each nwith a (n+2)-way tensor. This strategy is commonly used in NLP, e.g. Taub-Tabib et al. (2015) have different kernel functions for different order of dependency features. The second is an approximation method which aims to use a single tensor to handle all ns.\nMultiple Low-Rank Tensors Suppose that we can divide the feature set S(x, y) into subsets S1(x, y), S2(x, y), . . . , Sn(x, y) which correspond to features with one lexical part (unigram features), two lexical parts (bigram features), . . . and n lexical parts (n-gram features), respectively. To handle these types of features, we modify the training objective as follows:\nminimize T1,T2,··· ,Tn\n∑\n(x,y)∈D `(x, y; T1, T2, . . . , ...Tn), (8)\nwhere the score of a training instance (x, y) is defined as s(x, y; T ) =∑ni=1 ∑ φ∈Si(x,y) s(φ; Ti). We use the Tucker form low-rank tensor for T1, and the CP form for Ti (∀i > 1). We refer to this method as LRFR1-TUCKER & LRFR2-CP.\nWord Clusters Alternatively, to handle different numbers of lexical parts, we replace some lexical parts with discrete word clusters. Let c(w) denote the word cluster (e.g. from Brown clustering) for word w. For bigram features we have:\ns(y, u,w1,w2; T ) = s(y, u∧c(w1),w2; T ) + s(y, u∧c(w2),w1; T ) = T ×l y×f (u ∧ c(w1))×w ew2\n+ T ×l y×f (u ∧ c(w2))×w ew1 (9) where for each word we have introduced an additional set of non-lexical properties that are conjunctions of word clusters and the original non-lexical properties. This allows us to reduce an n-gram feature representation to a unigram representation. The advantage of this method is that it uses a single low-rank tensor to score features with different numbers of lexical parts. This is particularly helpful when we have very limited labeled data. We denote this method as LRFR1-BROWN, since we use Brown clusters in practice. In the experiments we use the\nTucker form for LRFR1-BROWN."

Note that this is a non-convex objective, so compared to the convex objective in a traditional log-linear model, we are trading better feature representations with the cost of a harder optimization problem. While stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a natural choice for learning representations in large data settings, problem (5) involves rank constraints, which require an expensive proximal operation to enforce the constraints at each iteration of SGD. We seek a more efficient learning algorithm. Note that we fixed the size of each transformation matrix Wi ∈ Rri×di so that the smaller dimension (ri < di) matches the upper bound on the rank. Therefore, the rank constants are always satisfied through a run of SGD and we in essence have an unconstrained optimization problem. Note that in this way we do not guarantee orthogonality and fullrank of the learned transformation matrices. These properties are assumed in general, but are not necessary according to (Kolda and Bader, 2009).\nThe gradients are computed via the chain-rule. We use AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and apply L2 regularization on all Wis and g, except for the case of ri=di, where we will start with Wi = I and regularize with ‖Wi - I‖2.

We include detailed feature templates in Table 2.\nPP-attachment and relation extraction are two fundamental NLP tasks, and we test our models on the largest English data sets. The preposition disambiguation task was designed for compositional semantics, which is an important application of deep learning and distributed representations. On all these tasks, we compare to the state-of-the-art.\nWe use the same word embeddings in Belinkov et al. (2014) on PP-attachment for a fair comparison. For the other experiments, we use the same 200-d word embeddings in Yu et al. (2015).\nRelation Extraction We use the English portion of the ACE 2005 relation extraction dataset (Walker et al., 2006). Following Yu et al. (2015), we use both gold entity spans and types, train the model on the news domain and test on the broadcast conversation domain. To highlight the impact of training data size we evaluate with all 43,518 relations (entity mention pairs) and a reduced training set of the first 10,000 relations. We report precision, recall, and F1.\nWe compare to two baseline methods: 1) a loglinear model with a rich binary feature set from Sun et al. (2011) and Zhou et al. (2005) as described in Yu et al. (2015) (BASELINE); 2) the embedding model (FCM) of Gormley et al. (2015), which uses rich linguistic features for relation extraction. We use the same feature templates and evaluate on finegrained relations (sub-types, 32 labels) (Yu et al., 2015). This will evaluate how LRFR can utilize nonlexical linguistic features.\nPP-attachment We consider the prepositional phrase (PP) attachment task of Belinkov et al. (2014),3 where for each PP the correct head (verbs or nouns) must be selected from content words before the PP (within a 10-word window). We formulate the task as a ranking problem, where we optimize the score of the correct head from a list of candidates with varying sizes.\nPP-attachment suffers from data sparsity because of bi-lexical features, which we will model with methods in §5. Belikov et al. show that rich features – POS, WordNet and VerbNet – help this task. The combination of these features give a large number of non-lexical properties, for which embeddings of non-lexical properties in LRFR should be useful.\nWe extract a dev set from section 22 of the PTB following the description in Belinkov et al. (2014).\nPreposition Disambiguation We consider the preposition disambiguation task proposed by Ritter et al. (2014). The task is to determine the spatial relationship a preposition indicates based on the two objects connected by the preposition. For example, “the apple on the refrigerator” indicates the “support by Horizontal Surface” relation, while “the apple on the branch” indicates the “Support from Above” relation. Since the meaning of a preposition depends\n3 http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rbg/code/pp\non the combination of both its head and child word, we expect conjunctions between these word embeddings to help, i.e. features with two lexical parts.\nWe include three baselines: point-wise addition (SUM) (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), concatenation (Ritter et al., 2014), and an SVM based on handcrafted features in Table 2. Ritter et al. show that the first two methods beat other compositional models.\nHyperparameters are all tuned on the dev set. The chosen values are learning rate η = 0.05 and the weight of L2 regularizer λ = 0.005 for LRFR, except for the third LRFR in Table 3 which has λ = 0.05.

However, LRFR-CP does not work as well on the features with only one lexical part. The Tucker-form does a better job of capturing interactions between different views. In the limited training setting, we find that LRFR-CP does best.\nAdditionally, the primary advantage of the CP approximation is its reduction in the number of model parameters and running time. We report each model’s running time for a single pass on the development set. The LRFR-CP is by far the fastest. The first three LRFR-TUCKER models are slightly slower than FCM, because they work on dense nonlexical property embeddings while FCM benefits from sparse vectors.\nPP-attachment Table 4 shows that LRFR (89.6 and 90.3) improves over the previous best standalone system HPCD (88.7) by a large margin, with exactly the same resources. Belinkov et al. (2014) also reported results of parsers and parser re-rankers, which can access to additional resources (complete parses for training and complete sentences as inputs) so it is unfair to compare them with the standalone systems like HPCD and our LRFR. Nonethe-\nless LRFR1-TUCKER & LRFR2-CP (90.3) still outperforms the state-of-the-art parser RBG (88.4), reranker Charniak-RS (88.6), and the combination of the state-of-the-art parser and compositional model RBG + HPCD (90.1). Thus, even with fewer resources, LRFR becomes the new best system.\nNot shown in the table: we also tried LRFR1TUCKER & LRFR2-CP with postag features only (89.7), and with grand-head-modifier conjunctions removed (89.3) . Note that compared to LRFR, RBG benefits from binary features, which also exploit grand-head-modifier structures. Yet the above reduced models still work better than RBG (88.4) without using additional resources.4 Moreover, the results of LRFR can still be potentially improved by combining with binary features. The above results show the advantage of our factorization method, which allows for utilizing pre-trained word embeddings, and thus can benefit from semi-supervised learning.\nPreposition Disambiguation LRFR improves (Table 5) over the best methods (SUM and Concatenation) in Ritter et al. (2014) as well as the SVM\n4Still this is not a fair comparison since we have different training objectives. Using RBG’s factorization and training with our objective will give a fair comparison and we leave it to future work.\nbased on the original lexical features (85.1). In this task LRFR1-BROWN better represents the unigram and bigram lexical features, compared to the usage of two low-rank tensors (LRFR1-TUCKER & LRFR2CP). This may be because LRFR1-BROWN has fewer parameters, which is better for smaller training sets.\nWe also include a control setting (LRFR1-BROWN - Control), which has a full rank parameter tensor with the same inputs on each view as LRFR1BROWN, but represented as one hot vectors without transforming to the hidden representations hs. This is equivalent to an SVM with the compound cluster features as in Koo et al. (2008). It performs much worse than LRFR1-BROWN, showing the advantage of using word embeddings and low-rank tensors.\nSummary For unigram lexical features, LRFRnTUCKER achieves better results than LRFRn-CP. However, in settings with fewer training examples,\nfeatures with more lexical parts (n-grams), or when faster predictions are advantageous, LRFRn-CP does best as it has fewer parameters to estimate. For ngrams of variable length, LRFR1-TUCKER & LRFR2CP does best. In settings with fewer training examples, LRFR1-BROWN does best as it has only one parameter tensor to estimate."

      "text" : "Dimensionality Reduction for Complex Features is a standard technique to address high-dimensional features, including PCA, alternating structural optimization (Ando and Zhang, 2005), denoising autoencoders (Vincent et al., 2008), and feature embeddings (Yang and Eisenstein, 2015). These methods treat features as atomic elements and ignore the inner structure of features, so they learn separate embedding for each feature without shared parameters. As a result, they still suffer from large parameter spaces when the feature space is very huge.5\nAnother line of research studies the inner structures of lexical features: e.g. Koo et al. (2008), Turian et al. (2010), Sun et al. (2011), Nguyen and Grishman (2014), Roth and Woodsend (2014), and Hermann et al. (2014) used pre-trained word embeddings to replace the lexical parts of features ; Srikumar and Manning (2014), Gormley et al. (2015) and Yu et al. (2015) propose splitting lexical features into different parts and employing tensors to perform classification. The above can therefore be seen as special cases of our model that only embed a certain part (view) of the complex features. This restriction also makes their model parameters form a full rank tensor, resulting in data sparsity and high computational costs when the tensors are large.\nComposition Models (Deep Learning) build representations for structures based on their component word embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2012; Socher et al., 2013b). When using only word embeddings, these models achieved successes on several NLP tasks, but sometimes fail to learn useful syntactic or semantic patterns beyond the strength of combinations of word\n5For example, a state-of-the-art dependency parser (Zhang and McDonald, 2014) extracts about 10 million features; in this case, learning 100-dimensional feature embeddings involves estimating approximately a billion parameters.\nembeddings, such as the dependency relation in Figure 1(a). To tackle this problem, some work designed their model structures according to a specific kind of linguistic patterns, e.g. dependency paths (Ma et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015), while a recent trend enhances compositional models with linguistic features. For example, Belinkov et al. (2014) concatenate embeddings with linguistic features before feeding them to a neural network; Socher et al. (2013a) and Hermann and Blunsom (2013) enhanced Recursive Neural Networks by refining the transformation matrices with linguistic features (e.g. phrase types). These models are similar to ours in the sense of learning representations based on linguistic features and embeddings.\nLow-rank Tensor Models for NLP aim to handle the conjunction among different views of features (Cao and Khudanpur, 2014; Lei et al., 2014; Chen and Manning, 2014). Yu and Dredze (2015) proposed a model to compose phrase embeddings from words, which has an equivalent form of our CPbased method under certain restrictions. Our work applies a similar idea to exploiting the inner structure of complex features, and can handle n-gram features with different ns. Our factorization (§3) is general and easy to adapt to new tasks. More importantly, it makes the model benefit from pre-trained word embeddings as shown by the PP-attachment results."
