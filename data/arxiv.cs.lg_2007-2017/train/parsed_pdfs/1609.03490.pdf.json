      "text" : "S EQUENCE analysis plays an important role in the field of bioin-formatics. Genomic sequences build the basis of a large body of research on understanding the biological processes in living organisms. As an important application of sequence based mining, the task of predicting Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) on genomes has attracted much attention over the years [1]. Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind on functional sites of DNA to control the regulation of genes. Each different TF binds to specific locations (or sites) on a genomic sequence to regulate cell machinery. While many TFs are highly conserved among different species [2], conservation of their binding sequence is low [3]. These TFBSs vary across different cell types, cell stages and genomes. Owing to the development of chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) technologies [4], maps of genome-wide binding sites are currently available for multiple TFs in a few cell types across human and mouse genomes via the ENCODE [1] database. Because ChIP-seq experiments are slow and expensive, they have not been performed for many important cell types or organisms. Therefore, computational methods to identify TFBS accurately remain essential for understanding the regulatory functioning and evolution of genomes. Such predictions are especially important for unannotated cellular contexts (e.g., cell types of rare diseases or rare organisms).\nString kernel techniques under the support vector machine (SVM) classification framework have been successfully used for detecting patterns of DNA or protein sequences before [5]. Through local substring (k-mer) comparisons that incorporate mismatches, this category of models extracts mismatch features and trains to classify sequence segments from a set of previously labeled sequences. Then, the learned models are used to classify a new set of sequences. Recently, [6] extended this discriminative SK+SVM classification\n• All authors are with Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville VA, 22903. E-mail: yanjun@virginia.edu\nsetup for predicting TFBSs in a cell-type specific manner. Their results [6] have suggested that traditional motif-driven approaches (details in Section 2.4) for TFBS predictions are not always sufficient for accurately accounting for cell-type specific binding profiles. Despite the exciting aforementioned framework [6], one shortcoming remains significant: this method assumes that the source and target samples are drawn from the same probability distribution. This makes string kernel non-applicable to most cases of TFBS predictions in unannotated cellular contexts.\nWe take into consideration that if a genome-wide ChIP-seq experiment has been performed for a specific TF in a certain context, it is normally unnecessary to computationally predict TFBSs for that specific [TF, context] pair again. Therefore, this paper focuses on computationally predicting TFBSs for cellular contexts that have not yet been annotated. We generate the “gold standard” reference labels, used for training, from an existing ChIP-seq TFBS map of an annotated context that is most related to the target [TF, context] configuration of interest. Since each TF’s binding sequence patterns vary with the context factor, it is likely that data samples in the annotated (source) context are distributed differently from samples in the unannotated (target) context. This also connects to observations in the literature that the TFBS sequences have low conservation across species even though many TF proteins are conserved across large evolutionary distances [7]. When implementing cross context prediction, it is desirable to design algorithms that remain effective under such distribution shifts [8]. While the problem may be unsolvable if the source and target distributions share nothing in common, recent machine learning studies [9] have provided effective adaptation for closely related distributions. Biologically, this also makes sense since closely related cell contexts should have similar gene regulation processes and similar TFBS sequence patterns [6].\nIn this paper, we propose an approach called “Transfer String Kernel (TSK)” that learns to transfer knowledge from an annotated to an unannotated cellular context to achieve better sequence-based TFBS predictions. Essentially, TSK re-weighs the source data so that\n2\nFig. 1: Overview of our experimental setup for cross-context TFBS prediction tasks.

Here, k = 5 and m ∈ {0, 1}.\nits distribution more closely matches that of the target data [9]. It assigns higher weights to those observations in the source context that are most similar to those in the target context, and lower weights to those that rarely occur in that context. This connects to a more general machine-learning topic called domain adaptation [10] (discussed in Section 2.4).\nIn summary, this paper includes the following contributions: • “Transfer String Kernel (TSK)” implements domain transfer of\nstring kernel via Kernel Mean Matching, on tasks for which target domain is unannotated; • Experimentally, we apply TSK on 14 different TFBS prediction tasks from mouse to human genomes. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first attempt of studying cross-context TFBS predictions across different genomes. This setting resembles the translational setup that many biologists are working on; • We demonstrate that TSK consistently outperforms state-ofthe-art TFBS prediction tools, especially for those TFs whose binding properties do not conserve across contexts; • Our experiments show that TSK exhibits robust performance despite the label imbalance issue that is common in TFBS prediction tasks; • Finally, we show that TSK generalizes well to other crosscontext sequence based prediction tasks.\nTSK is a general cross-context sequence modeling approach and not tied to the TFBS applications. We show this generality by applying it for predicting peptide binding (PB) to Major Histocompatibility Complex Molecules (MHC class I). MHC is a set of cell surface proteins that bind to peptide fragments derived from pathogens and display them on cell surface for recognition by the appropriate Tcells (i.e., consequently controlling the adaptive immune response). Knowledge of these peptide bindings helps in studying immunity and is vital for vaccine development. The protein sequence-based PB pre-\ndiction tasks are similar to TFBS tasks because: a) MHC PB bindings vary across organisms and b) obtaining such experimental data is a complex, expensive and time consuming task, therefore leading to lack of labeled samples in target (human) domain. However, it differs from TFBS prediction tasks in its larger dictionary size (due to protein sequences) as well as in the sample properties (e.g., shorter sequence length, varying ratios of positive to negative samples and size) of the datasets."

      "text" : "The sequence-based TFBS prediction problem can be casted as a string classification task. For a certain TF of interest, on a particular genome under a specific cellular context, the task aims to classify a DNA sequence segment as a potential TFBS or a non-binding background site (see a sample sequence-label pair (x, y) in Figure 1(b)). When considering multiple TFs and various cellular contexts (Figure 1(a)), this constitutes a family of sequence classification problems. For example in Figure 1(b), we train a string classifier using labeled segments (obtained from ChIP-seq) of TF_1 from the source context. The classifier is then used to predict potential TFBS sites of the same TF (TF_1) in the target context. This means that if we work on N different TFs, we are handling a family of N different classification tasks. In case of Figure 1(a), there are four different TFBS tasks for 4 TFs.\nFor each task, when performing sequence-based TFBS predictions in an unannotated cellular context, we face a data problem called distribution shift. We first define necessary notations to explain this problem. We have two spaces, X represents all possible sequence patterns and Y represents their respective labels. The set of source samples:\nZsd = {(x sd 1 , y sd 1 ), ..., (x sd nsd , ysdnsd)} ⊆ X × Y, (1)\nfollow a probability distribution Psd(x, y) 1 in the annotated source context.

      "heading" : "2.2 Basic Model: Mismatch String Kernels with SVM",
      "text" : "The key idea of string kernels is to apply a function φ(·), which maps sequences of arbitrary length into a vectorial feature space of fixed length. In this space, a standard classifier such as a support vector machine (SVM) [11] can then be applied. Kernel-version SVMs calculate the decision function for an input sample x as,\nf(x) = ∑\ni∈sd\nαiK(x sd i , x) + b. (3)\nString kernels [5] [12], implicitly compute an inner product in the mapped feature space φ(x) as:\nK(x, x′) = 〈φ(x), φ(x′)〉, (4)\nwhere x = (s1, . . . , s|x|), x, x ′ ∈ S, |x| denotes the length of the sequence x, S represents the set of all sequences composed of all possible dictionary items (for example, in case of DNA sequences si ∈ {A,C, T,G}), and φ : S → Rm defines the mapping from a sequence x ∈ S to a m-dimensional feature vector.\nThe feature representation φ(·) plays a key role in the effectiveness of sequence analysis since biological sequences cannot be readily described as feature vectors. One classic representation is to treat DNA sequence segments as an unordered set of nucleotide k-mers (combinations of k adjacent nucleotide residues). A feature\n1. This probability varies with different TFi\nvector indexed by all k-mers records the number of occurrences of each k-mer in the current sequence. The string kernel using this representation is called spectrum kernel [5], where the spectrum representation counts the occurrences of each nucleotide k-mer in a DNA sequence segment. Kernel scores between sequences are then computed by taking an inner product between corresponding “k-mer - indexed” feature vectors:\nK(x, x′) = ∑\nγ∈Γk\ncx(γ) · cx′(γ), (5)\nwhere γ represents a k-mer, Γk is the set of all possible k-mers, and cx(γ) is the number of occurrences (with normalization) of k-mer γ in sequence x.\nHowever, exact kernel matching in biological sequences is ineffective due to naturally occurring letter (e.g., nucleotide) substitutions, insertions, or deletions. Therefore, inexact comparison is critical for effective matching between sequence segments. In string kernels, this is typically achieved by using different families of mismatches [12]. We use the concept of (k,m)-mismatch string kernels [12] (illustrated in Figure 1(c)), which considers k-mer counts with m inexact matching of k-mers (e.g. k=5, m ∈ {0, 1}). For this kernel,\nK(x, x′) = ∑\nγ∈Γk\nck,mx (γ) · c k,m x′ (γ), (6)\nck,mx = ∑\ng∈S(γ,m,k)\ncx(g), (7)\nS(γ,m, k) denotes the set of contiguous substrings of length k that differ from γ in at most m positions (see Figure 1(c) with an example case for (k = 5,m ∈ {0, 1})).\nThrough mismatches, (k,m)-mismatch kernel allows flexibility when matching k-mers between sequences. This flexibility partly reflects the true biological nature of DNA or proteins sequences since they are prone to mutations like deletions, insertions, substitutions etc. As expected, it performs better than spectrum kernel (as seen in Section 4.1) therefore; it is a natural choice for our TSK approach.\nIn practice, string kernel implementations typically require efficient computation without explicitly constructing potentially highdimensional feature vectors φ(·). This is because the explicit feature vector mapping φ(·) becomes problematic (especially in the case of inexact matching) for even small value of k (due to the dimensionality of φ(·) being exponential in k). Researchers have proposed various strategies [5], [12] to address these computational difficulties. We adopt a statistical strategy from [12] that provides linear-time string kernel computations and scales well with dictionary size and input length."

      "heading" : "2.3 Proposed Model: Transfer String Kernel",
      "text" : "String kernel assumes training and testing samples are drawn from the same probability distribution. To consider the variation between source and target samples in our application, domain adaptation [10], [13] serves as a natural candidate to tackle this computational challenge. In machine learning, domain adaptation aims to use data or a model of a well-analyzed source domain to obtain or refine a model for a less analyzed target domain. The specific “domain transfer” setting being focused in this paper assumes that historical labels only exist in the source context and are not available in the target context (reasons explained in Section 1). Accordingly, we propose “Transfer String Kernel (TSK)” approach to achieve better cross-context TFBS predictions by transferring knowledge from an annotated context to an unannotated context.\n4 TSK revises the (k,m)-mismatch string kernel framework using a “Kernel Mean Matching” (KMM) strategy [9] in order to perform knowledge transfer. To our knowledge, TSK has not been proposed in the literature for cross-context TFBS prediction tasks. Specifically, TSK adapts string kernel under the “covariate shift” assumption [9]. It assumes that the conditional probability distribution of the output variable, given the input variable, remains fixed in both the source and target set. In other words, the data shift happens for the marginal probability distribution of feature variables (from Psd(x) to Ptd(x)) and not for the conditional distribution P (y|x).\nThe key to correcting this type of sampling bias is to estimate the “importance weight” for each source sample [8]:\nβ(x, y) := Ptd(x, y)\nPsd(x, y) =\nP (y|x)Ptd(x) P (y|x)Psd(x) = Ptd(x) Psd(x) . (8)\nThe KMM estimator accounts for the difference between Ptd(x, y) and Psd(x, y) by re-weighting the source points so that the means of the source and target points in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) are close. This reweighing process is therefore called “Kernel Mean Matching” (KMM). When the RKHS is universal, the population solution of weight vector β̂ (in the following Equation 9) to the KMM optimization (of matching means) is exactly the vector form of ratio Ptd(x)\nPsd(x) (in Equation 8) including all x from the source\ndomain. Let βi represent the “importance weight” of a source instance xi. More specifically, KMM uses a “maximum mean discrepancy” measure to minimize the difference between the empirical mean of the source and the empirical mean of the target distribution. Formally, KMM attempts to match the mean elements in a feature space induced by a kernel function K(·, ·):\nβ̂ = argminβ L̂(β), (9)\nwhere,\nL̂(β) = ‖ 1\nnsd\nnsd∑\ni=1\nβi ∗ φ(x sd i )−\n1\nntd\nntd∑\ni=1\nφ(xtdi )‖ 2 (10)\n= 1\nn2sd β\nT Kβ −\n2\nn2sd κTβ + constant, (11)\ns.t. βi ∈ [0, B] and | nsd∑\ni=1\nβi − nsd| ≤ nsdǫ.\nHere, K is the kernel matrix among all source examples, and κi is the weighted sum of kernel values among a source example and all target examples:\nKij :=K(x sd i , x sd j ), (12)\nκi := nsd\nntd\nntd∑\nj=1\nK(xsdi , x td j ). (13)\nLarge values of κi correspond to more important observations xsdi and are more likely to lead to larger βi. Equation 9 involves a quadratic program which can be efficiently solved using the interior point methods or any other subsequent procedures such as projected gradient optimization method [9].\nAlgorithm 1 Algorithm for Transfer String Kernel through matching means in RKHS\n1: procedure TSK 2: Implement (k,m)-mismatch string kernel to calculate the\nkernel matrix K and vector κ; 3: Use Kernel Mean Matching estimator on K and κ to obtain\nthe importance weight β̂i for each source sample i; 4: Use β̂i to perform instance re-weighted SVM training step; 5: Use the trained SVM model to perform sequence classifica-\ntion of target samples.\nThe derived importance weights β̂ are then used to re-weigh source samples in a revised support vector machine training algorithm, i.e., an instance weighted SVM that aims to optimize:\nnsd∑\ni=1\nαi − 0.5 ∑\ni,j∈sd\nαiαjyiyjK(x sd i , x sd j ), (14)\ns.t.\nnsd∑\ni=1\nαiyi = 0, and β̂iC ≥ αi ≥ 0.

      "text" : "Transcription factors influence gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequence in a genomic region. Therefore accurate models for identifying and describing the binding sites of TFs are essential in understanding cells. Previous techniques include many sequencemotif based computational approaches that typically use positionbased sequence information for predicting TFBS. Relying on a set of known transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for a given TF, the binding preference is generally represented in the form of a position weight matrix (PWM) [14], [15] (also called positionspecific scoring matrix) derived from a position frequency matrix (PFM). A PFM is essentially an occurrence table, summarizing the number of each nucleotide being observed at each position of a set of aligned TFBSs. [6] have suggested that traditional motif-driven approaches are not always sufficient to accurately account for celltype specific binding profiles. While motif-based PWMs are compact and interpretable, they can under-fit ChIP-seq data by failing to capture subtle but detectable and important sequence signals, such as direct DNA-binding preferences of certain TFs, cofactor binding sequences, accessibility signals, or other discriminative sequence features. Gene regulatory programs are primarily regulated through cell-context specific binding of TFs. Therefore, it becomes more clear that TFBS analyses should consider distinct cell contexts (see Figure 1(a)). To the best of authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first attempt of direct testing of cross-context prediction performance of such methods."

      "heading" : "2.4.2 String Classification",
      "text" : "Our formulation of TFBS prediction belongs to a general category of \"string classification\". Various methods have previously been proposed to solve string classification, including generative (e.g., Hidden Markov Models-HMMs) and discriminative approaches. Among the discriminative approaches, string kernel methods provide some of the\n5 most accurate results, such as for remote protein fold and homology detections [5], [12]. Aside from spectrum kernel [5] and (k,m)mismatch string kernel [12] introduced in the previous section, a few other notable string kernels include (but are not limited to): (1) The gapped kernel calculates dot-product of (non-contiguous) k-mer counts with gaps allowed between elements. (2) More generally, the substring kernel [16] measures similarity between sequences based on common co-occurrence of exact sub-patterns (e.g., substrings). (3) The profile kernel [17] uses the notion of similarity based on a probabilistic model (e.g. profile). (4) Under the semi-supervised setting, the so-called “sequence neighborhood” kernel or “cluster” kernel [18] proposes a semi-supervised extension of string kernel, which replaces every sequence with a set of “similar” (neighboring) sequences and a new representation is obtained by averaging representations of these neighboring sequences found in the unlabeled data using a certain sequence similarity measure.\nSequence labeling or sequence tagging is another related category of formulations for sequence modeling. Many successful works in the field of natural language processing [19] belong to this category in which each position of input sequences can be annotated with tags indicating parts of speech, named entities, semantic roles, etc. Popular bioinformatics tasks predicting proteins’ local functional properties [20] have been modeled as a labeling or tagging of amino acids on proteins. Many important functional properties are computationally predicted in this fashion, such as secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane topology or the locations of coiled-coil regions. Multiple classic machine learning methods have been benchmark tools for sequence tagging, like conditional random field [21]. We omit a full survey of this topic due to its vast body of previous literature and loose connection to our TFBS formulations."

      "text" : "TSK relates to a more general machine-learning topic “covariate shift\". Traditional supervised learning assumes source and target samples are usually drawn from the same probability distribution. This assumption can be easily violated in practice, for instance, due to sampling bias or nonstationarity of the sampling environment (i.e. the case of TSK) [8]. Algorithms that remain effective under such distribution shifts are highly preferred. This problem has been investigated in both statistics and machine learning under various assumptions [8]. The covariate shift assumption assumes that the conditional probability distribution of the output variable y, given the input variable, x remains fixed in both the source and target. Under this setting, the basic motivation to correct the sampling bias is to re-weigh the source data so that its distribution matches more closely to that of the target data. A number of previous methods have been proposed to estimate the “importance weight” β from finite samples, including kernel mean matching (KMM), logistic regression, KL importance estimation and many others [8].\nMore generally, TSK belongs to topics of domain adaptation and transfer learning [13] [10], where one aims to use data or models of a well-analyzed source domain to obtain or refine models for a less analyzed target domain. This helps when datasets from the two domains belong to different feature spaces or follow different data distributions. For such scenarios, knowledge transfer will potentially improve the performance of learning by avoiding or reducing the expensive data-labeling efforts [13]. A good classifier can only be trained when a sufficient amount of annotated training data is available. However, labeled training data in biomedical fields is scarce. Obtaining such labeled datasets can be costly and time-consuming. This results in the data sparsity problem that is a major bottleneck for applying machine learning in biomedical domain. Computational\nmethods with the ability of “knowledge transfer” become highly crucial for such applications because biomedical data is intrinsically complex and heterogeneous at almost every level (e.g., different species, different tissue types, etc). Transfer learning can help in reusing knowledge from annotated datasets to new domains [22], reducing the knowledge gap of labeled data due to heterogenous variations. For example, one previous study [10] explored “domain adaptation” strategies for a task of sequence-based prediction for acceptor splice sites. It assumed that historical labels exist for both source and target contexts, which is different from our setting. We aim to predict TFBS for a cellular context that has not yet been annotated (i.e. no label exists in the target domain). Our setting is more practical for TFBS prediction tasks, because if a ChIP-seq experiment has been performed for a specific TF in a certain context, it is normally unnecessary to computationally predict TFBS for that specific domain again. Experimental results in Section 4 successfully present a strong case of mining bio-medical data where the transfer of knowledge across domains is critical and fruitful."

      "heading" : "2.4.4 Covariate Shift & Domain Adaptation",
      "text" : "Domain adaptation has been widely studied in machine learning literature to train an effective classifier for a target domain for which labeled data is rare, or even unavailable (this paper’s case). By exploiting labeled training samples from a different but related source domain, a variety of previous studies have demonstrated its effectiveness on multiple applications including sentiment analysis [23], object classification [24], activity recognition [25], text categorization [26] and Brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks [27]. Roughly speaking, previous learning methods for domain adaptation can be summarized into two main types:\nCovariate Shift: First, many existing studies try to estimate weights of samples that account for the mismatch in distributions between a target and a source domain. Covariate shift assumes that the marginal distributions of the source and target instances differ while the conditional distribution of the target output remains the same across domains [28]. Methods for domain adaptation under covariate shift assumptions mostly try to estimate the weights of source instances so that the weighted source distributions are most similar to the target distribution. Then, an instance-weighted classifier is trained for the target domain. For instance, the authors of [29] propose density estimators that incorporate sample selection bias to adapt two distributions. The Kernel Mean Matching (KMM) method [9], [30] then learns the weights by matching the distributions in a RKHS, with a recent extension [31] developing surrogate-kernel based kernel matching. Later, [32], [33] propose to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the target distribution and the weighted source distribution. Several recent papers [25], [34], [35] aim to estimate the optimal weights by solving least-square based formulations. Furthermore, theoretical analysis of this type of domain adaptation has been studied by [36].\nThe aforementioned studies separate the estimation of importance weights and the training of weighted learning models in two stages. Several existing machine learning methods have been explored in this framework, such as importance-weighted logistic regression [33], importance-weighted kernel regression [32], importance-weighted Gaussian processes [37], and the so-called consistent distance metric learning method [38].\nMoreover, a few studies try to unify the two stages. For instance, the authors of [39] propose a discriminative learning based adaptation that trains an integrated model to obtain both importance weights and the classifier at the same time. As another example, a so-called doubly robust covariate shift correction method [40] first trains an non-\n6\nweighted classifier model, estimates the weights of source instances, and then retrains an instance-weighted classification model with the learned weights.\nSubspace Adaptation: Another direction of domain adaptation is to extract a subspace, or newer feature representations in the data space, to model invariant parts across target and source distributions. Transferring knowledge between domains is through such learned subspaces or feature representations. For example, [23], [41] propose novel feature representations for the domain adaptation purpose. Transfer component analysis [42] was introduced to find low dimensional representations in RHKS where the target and source domains are similar. The authors of [43] try to learn a linear subspace that is suitable for knowledge transfer by minimizing Bregman divergence between target and source distributions in this subspace. A related study [44] transforms target samples such that they are a linear combination of basis from the source domain. More recently, [45] learns a domain-invariant data transformation to minimize differences between source and target distributions while preserving functional relations between data and labels. Furthermore, the authors of [46] propose to identify subspaces that align to the eigenspaces of the target and source domains."

They used experimental labels of peptide binding from 3 classes of MHC molecules in humans as performance benchmarks. In 2012, the second machine learning competition in Immunology [48] increased the number of experimental datasets for both human and mouse molecules, providing training and test data for both species. The task was formulated as classifying eluted peptide (naturally processed by MHC) as positive samples while simple binding and non-binding peptides were classified as negative labeled samples.\nFor peptide-protein interaction prediction, relative positions of amino acids and their physiochemical properties play a very important role [49]. The oligo kernel proposed by [50], takes the relative\npositions into consideration by assigning a weight to each common k-mer based on their relative position in the two peptide sequences. For the 2012 Machine Learning Competition in Immunology for peptide binding prediction, [49] showed that their Generic String (GS) kernel gave state-of-the-art performance when implemented on the datasets provided by the competition from [51]. According to the authors, the GS kernel includes information regarding both physiochemical property and relative position of amino acids during k-mer comparison.

The dictionary size is d=4. • Number of source samples (n): For each of the 14 TFs, we use its top 500 (ranked according to ChIP-seq peak enrichment) mouse TFBS sequences. For each TF task, we randomly select 500 negative samples using the strategy in Section 3.2.1. Totally, for each TF, we have a training set containing n=1000 sequences (positive=500, negative=500). • Ratio of positive to negative target samples (r): In a target context, we generated a validation set for hyperparameter tuning and a test set for performance evaluation. For each of the 14 TFs, we use the subsequent 500 human TFBS sequences each for both the positive validation set and positive testing set. However, the number of negative validation and testing samples may vary. For TFBS prediction on an unannotated context, it is not practical to assume that the ratio between positive and negative sites is always balanced. This is because the number of bound sites varies from one cell-context to another cell-context as well as across different TFs. Furthermore, the number of TFBSs is generally much smaller compared to regions without the TFBSs. Accordingly, we create target sets in which positive to negative ratio varies, simulating real-world predictions on unlabeled datasets 3. By varying negative samples in the target context and keeping the positive samples constant, we obtain\n2. We first select “open” DNA segments where the TFBS binding can take place. Next, we remove all possible TFBS regions for a particular TF.\n3. Intuitively, searching TFBS sites should consider all genomic positions. In reality, researchers use epigenomic evidence to filter out non-possible binding sites.\ndifferent positive to negative ratios in target data, i.e r=1:1, 1:2 and 1:3 respectively. A ratio of 1:3 means we expect 3 negative sites for every observed positive site in the target data. More specifically, we generated three cases of validation and test sets for each TF task, containing n=1000 (positive=500, negative=500), n=1500 (positive=500, negative=1000) and n=2000 (positive=500, negative=1500) sequences. • String kernel hyperparameters (k,m): For both SK and TSK, we tune two hyperparameters: the length of input kmer, k ∈ {8, 10, 12}, and the number of allowed mismatches, m ∈ {1, 2, 3}. We first perform hyperparameter selection using our validation sets and then evaluate model performance using the selected hyperparameters on the test sets. Hyperparameters for the SVM training (C ∈ {0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000}) are also selected using the validation sets.\nThe setup described above is novel. Our cross-context setup differs from previous TFBS prediction works and closely resembles a real biological scenario. The data statistics and hyperparameters used in our TFBS experiments are summarized in Table 2."

SVMs are known to provide state-of-the-art performance for many applications [11], including a large number of successes in computational biology [55]. Binary SVM learns a real-valued function that assigns a continuous score to each candidate sequence segment based on the labeled source set. Larger scores correspond to more confident predictions as the positive class. As a result, we rank all candidate samples in the target set using SVM prediction values. This naturally leads us to utilize Area Under Curve (AUC) score (from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) as our main evaluation metric. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is commonly used as a summary measure of diagnostic accuracy. It is interpreted as the probability that a randomly selected “event” will be regarded with greater suspicion (in terms of its continuous measurement) than a randomly selected “non-event”. AUC score ranges between 0 and 1, where values closer to 1 indicate more successful predictions.\n8 A ve ra ge A U C S co re a cr os s 14 T F s\n0.75\n0.755\n0.76\n0.765\n0.77\n0.775\n0.78\n0.785\n0.79\n0.795\n0.8\n8,1 8,2 8,3 10,1 10,2 10,3 12,1 12,2 12,3\nTSK (1:1) TSK (1:2) TSK (1:3)\nSK (1:1) SK (1:2) SK (1:3)\nParameters (k,m)\nFig. 2: Average AUC scores from TSK and SK on TFBS predictions when varying hyperparameters (k,m).

      "text" : "Table 5 presents the test AUC scores from different approaches for cross-context TFBS predictions of 14 selected TFs. For each TF, training was done on TFBS data from the mouse genome (source) and testing data was obtained from the human genome (target). We select k = 10 and m = 1 for SK and TSK based on validation set performance (details in Section 4.3). TSK outperforms SK and two PWM baselines for most of the cases and is generally robust for imbalanced datasets (when r=1:2 and 1:3). Position Weight/Frequency Matrix based approaches, MEME and CISFINDER, also perform well for three TFs (USF2, RAD21 and SMC3). However, their performance is worse than SK and TSK for majority of the TFs. MEME and CISFINDER also exhibit a higher variance when considering all 14 TF prediction tasks.\nFurthermore, we calculate the conservation scores for each of the 14 different TFs we used. The conservation scores indicate how well conserved (or slowly evolving) individual positions of TFBS sequences are, for a particular TF. Conservation scores are calculated for 100 basepair-length sequences. Segments obtained from top 2000 binding sites of all 14 TFs from the human genome. For these sequences, a phyloP score for each nucleotide (total of 200,000) is calculated using the Galaxy tool [60], [61], [62]. A positive phyloP score denotes conservation (slow evolution) and a negative phyloP score denotes acceleration (fast evolution) of the nucleotide. Thus, after adding and normalizing the scores according to positively and negatively scored nucleotides for each TF, we take their log (for scaling) and subtract the acceleration scores from the conservation scores. We then include information regarding fraction of nonconserved nucleotides for each TF to our final score. Non-conserved nucleotides are those nucleotides for which phyloP scores (positive or negative) are not reported. We calculate this as a penalty term :\np = log(Cn Ct )\n100 (16)\nThe equation for calculating the final conservation score (CS) is:\nCS = log(PosScore)− log(|NegScore|)− p (17)\nwhere Cn is the count of non-conserved nucleotides and Ct is the count of total number of nucleotides (= 200, 000). PosScore denotes normalized sum of all positive phyloP scores (quantifying slow evolution) while NegScore denotes normalized sum of all negative phyloP scores (quantifying fast evolution). Conservation scores for each TF are provided in the last column of Table 5.\nFor TFs that MEME and CISFINDER give high accuracy, we observe that they also have high conservation scores. When the conservation scores are not high, SK and TSK models perform better. Thus, MEME and CISFINDER perform well on TFs with strong sequence conservation across genomes. This indicates that string kernel based approaches can be used to complement Position Weight/Frequency Matrix based approaches.\nIt is important to note that TSK consistently outperforms SK even on more conserved TFs. This demonstrates that domain adaptation technique helps to improve the basic string kernel for cross-context sequence predictions."

Figure 5 presents tuning results for all 5 MHC PB prediction tasks, where training was done on the mouse H2-Kb MHC PB dataset and validation was done on train data for human provided by 2012 competition in Immunology [48]. Each task uses a different test dataset for human model evaluation.

      "heading" : "5 DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "Determining how TF proteins interact with DNA to regulate context specific gene regulation is essential for fully understanding biological processes and diseases. Most previous computational tools for predicting TFBSs assume the same distribution across target and source contexts. We, however, have shown that it is beneficial to consider the distribution shift. The proposed TSK method improves the performance of sequence-driven TFBS predictions by accommodating differences among underlying sample distributions and applying knowledge transfer from the source to target context. We have also examined the imbalanced (positive to negative ratio) data issue in the target domain, to ensure realistic and robust TFBS predictions. Our experimental results indicate:\n• TSK overall improves performance of string kernel on crosscontext TFBS predictions; • TSK and SK outperform the state-of-the-art Position Weight/Frequency Matrix based TFBS tools, especially for less conserved TFs, and can be used as complementary tools to the latter; • TSK can be easily generalized to other sequence based prediction tasks, e.g. prediction of PB to MHC-I complex molecules.\n5. We also apply TSK to this within-context setting and get following AUC scores: 0.8325 (HLA-A0201), 0.9233 (HLA-B0702), 0.9282 (HLA-B4403), 0.8599 (HLA-B5301) and 0.82 (HLA-B5701). Interestingly, we find that TSK adapts and reduces the differences among the training and testing datasets and gives slightly better performance on 3 out of 5 MHC PB prediction tasks (HLAA0201, HLA-B0702 and HLA-B4403). SK’s performance is represented by blue bars in Figure 6\n11\nThe code for TSK has been made available at www.github.com/ QData/TransferStringKernel. TSK is a general sequence modeling architecture. Therefore, our future plan is to extend TSK to a wider variety of sequence based applications. We would also like to study and compare implementation of other kernels from the string kernel family as components of the TSK approach. In the meantime, we are aware of the limitations of TSK due to its high computational complexity when handling datasets with a large number of source and target samples. We plan to explore random sampling based techniques to scale up TSK on “large-scale\" sequence mining tasks."

Related methods in the literature fail to perform such predictions accurately, since they do not consider sample distribution shift of sequence segments from an annotated (source) context to an unannotated (target) context. We, therefore, propose a method called “Transfer String Kernel” (TSK) that achieves improved prediction of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) using knowledge transfer via cross-context sample adaptation. TSK maps sequence segments to a high-dimensional feature space using a discriminative mismatch string kernel framework. In this high-dimensional space, labeled examples of the source context are re-weighted so that the revised sample distribution matches the target context more closely. We have experimentally verified TSK for TFBS identifications on fourteen different TFs under a cross-organism setting. We find that TSK consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art TFBS tools, especially when working with TFs whose binding sequences are not conserved across contexts. We also demonstrate the generalizability of TSK by showing its cutting-edge performance on a different set of cross-context tasks for the MHC peptide binding predictions.",
