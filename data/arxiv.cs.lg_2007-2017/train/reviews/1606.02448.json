However, a major concern in this context is when the system cannot decide whether the user feedback for each item is actually exploitable. Indeed, much of the content may have been simply ignored by the user. The present work proposes to exploit available information regarding the display position bias under the so-called Position-based click model (PBM). We first discuss how this model differs from the Cascade model and its variants considered in several recent works on multiple-play bandits. We then provide a novel regret lower bound for this model as well as computationally efficient algorithms that display good empirical and theoretical performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 08:31:46 GMT  (527kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02448v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["paul lagr\u00e9e", "claire vernade", "olivier capp\u00e9"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02448"}
