      "text" : "Index Terms—graph signal processing, signal restoration, classifier learning\nI. INTRODUCTION A fundamental problem in machine learning is semisupervised learning [1]: given partially observed labels (possibly corrupted by noise) as input, train a classifier so that unclassified samples can also be appropriately assigned labels. Among many approaches to the problem is a class of graphbased methods [2]–[5] that model each sample as a node in a graph, connected to other nodes via undirected edges, with weights that reflect pairwise distances in a high-dimensional feature space. See Fig. 1 for an example of a graph with eight nodes (samples) in a two-dimensional feature space. Establishing a graph representation of the data means that intrinsic properties of the graph spectrum (e.g., low graph frequencies that are eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix) can be exploited for label assignment via spectral graph theory [6].\nIn this paper, we extend previous graph-based studies by considering in addition negative edge weights in the graph\nG.

Lin are with National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan 30013 (e-mail: wengtai2008@hotmail.com, cwlin@ee.nthu.edu.tw).\nand examining their effects on binary graph classifier learning. Conventional formulations in graph signal processing (GSP) [7] use non-negative edge weights that reflect inter-node correlation; an edge weight wi,j = 0 means samples xi and xj are conditionally independent. However, negative edge weights can signify anti-correlation: wi,j = −1 means samples xi and xj are expected to take on different values, i.e. |xi−xj | should be large. Incorporating pairwise anti-correlation into the graph should intuitively be beneficial during classifier learning. For example, if edge weight w1,2 is assigned −1 in Fig. 1, then from the graph G itself, one already expects x1 and x2 to be assigned opposite labels in a binary classifier.\nTo study the implications of negative edge weights, we view a binary classifier as a piecewise constant (PWC) graph-signal and cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation [8]. We show first that a graph Laplacian matrix L with negative edge weights can be indefinite, and a common graph-signal prior called graph Laplacian regularizer [9]–[20] xTLx for candidate signal x—measuring signal smoothness with respect to the underlying graph—can lead to pathological solutions. In response, we derive an “optimal” perturbation matrix ∆ so that L + ∆ is positive semi-definite (PSD), resulting in a stable signal prior. To efficiently compute an approximate ∆, we propose a fast recursive algorithm that identifies a lower bound for the smallest eigenvalue of L via a novel application of the Haynsworth Inertia Additivity formula [21].\nSecond, instead of forcing a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized smoothness on graph—an extension of total generalized variation (TGV) [22] to the graph-signal domain—that promotes the right amount of ambiguity in the classifier signal. We show that by interpreting\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n04 92\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 N\nov 2\n01 6\n2 a graph as an electrical circuit, the generalized smoothness condition is equivalent to the Kirchhoff’s current law [23], leading to an argument why negative edge weights should not be used when considering generalized smoothness.\nFinally, we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) [24] that efficiently solves the posed MAP problem for the noisy label scenario. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms SVM variants, a well-known robust classifier in the machine learning literature called RobustBoost [25], and graph-based classifiers using positive-edge graphs noticeably for both noiseless and noisy label scenarios.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. We first overview related works in Section II. We then review basic GSP concepts and define a graph-signal smoothness prior in Section III. In Section IV, we derive the optimal perturbation matrix ∆ such that L + ∆ is PSD. In Section V, we describe a fast algorithm to approximate the best ∆. In Section VI, we present a label noise model, introduce the generalized graph-signal smoothness prior, and present an efficient algorithm to solve the MAP problem for classifier learning with noisy labels. Finally, we present experimental results and conclusions in Section VII and VIII, respectively."

      "text" : "Classifier learning with label noise has garnered much interest, including a workshop1 in NIPS’10 [26] and a journal special issue in Neurocomputing [27]. There exists a wide range of approaches, including theoretical (e.g., label propagation in [28]) and application-specific (e.g., emotion detection using inference algorithm based on multiplicative update rule [29]). In this paper, similar to previous works [2]–[5] we choose to build a graph-based classifier, where each acquired sample is represented as a node in a highdimensional feature space and connects to other sample nodes in its neighborhood. Compared to previous works on graphbased classifier learning, our approach is novel in the following aspects. First, we learn a binary classifier via a classical MAP formulation but consider in addition negative edge weights that signify anti-correlation. For the graph-signal smoothness prior to be numerically stable, this requires a perturbation to the graph Laplacian matrix L to make it PSD, which we compute efficiently. Second, we show how generalized graph smoothness notion—extending TGV [22] to the graph-signal domain—can be interpreted intuitively as Kirchoff’s current law and used to promote ambiguity in the classifier solution."

      "text" : "One alternative line of previous works founded their GSP analysis on algebraic theory in traditional digital signal processing that relies on the shift operator [4], [30]–[32]. More concretely, instead of the graph Laplacian matrix L, the adjacency matrix W is used as the variation operator to define signal smoothness and graph frequencies. As an example, for graph-signal restoration, a smoothness prior ‖x−Wx‖pp for some positive integer p was proposed in [4]. When edge weights are negative, however, such smoothness prior can become insensible. Consider the three-node graph in Fig. 2. Assuming p = 2, the smoothness prior when w = −1 is:\n‖x−Wx‖22 = ‖(I−W)x‖ 2 2 = ∥∥∥∥∥∥  1 1 01 1 1\n0 1 1  x1x2 x3 ∥∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n2\n= (x1 + x2) 2 + (x1 + x2 + x3) 2 + (x2 + x3) 2\nwhich means the prior is just promoting a small DC term, despite the presence of two negative edges, which is clearly not sensible.\nSuppose a total variation (TV) approach [33] is taken instead, so that a smoothness prior using L but based on l1norm is used instead: i.e., |Lx|. Unfortunately, this prior can also be insensible when edges are negative. Using the same 3-node graph in Fig. 2 but with w = 1, |Lx| is:\n|Lx| = ∣∣∣∣∣∣  −1 1 01 0 −1\n0 −1 1  x1x2 x3 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ x2 − x1 x1 − x3 x3 − x2 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ In other words, the prior tries to minimize the difference between every node pair, even though there is a negative edge between node 1 and 2. Thus this prior is also not sensible.\nThese observations motivate our current study to use xTLx as the appropriate smoothness prior; for the same example,\nxTLx = −1(x1 − x2)2 + w(x2 − x3)2 (1)\nwhich promotes a large difference between node 1 and 2, and promotes a large or small difference between node 2 and 3 depending on the sign of w. This is clearly a more sensible prior. Of course, direct use of xTLx can lead to numerical problems, and thus L must be first perturbed in some optimal manner. This is the focus of this paper.\n3"

      "text" : "Recent studies in the control community have examined the conditions where one or more negative edge weights would induce a graph Laplacian to be indefinite [34], [35]. The analysis, however, rests on an assumption that there are no cycles in the graph with more than one negative edge, which is too restrictive for binary classifier graphs.\n[36] considered a signed social network where each edge denotes either a cohesive (positive edge weight) or oppositive (negative edge weight) relationship between two vertices. The goal is to identify similar groups within the graph, and thus is akin to a distributed clustering problem, which is unsupervised by definition. In contrast, our goal is to restore a classifier graph-signal from partially observed labels, which is a semisupervised learning problem."

Non-negative eigenvalues λk can be interpreted as graph frequencies, and eigenvectors vk interpreted as corresponding graph frequency components. Together they define the graph spectrum for graph G.\nIn this paper, we consider also negative edge weights wi,j , and thus eigenvalues λk can be negative and L can be indefinite.

In the graph frequency domain, it means that x contains mostly low graph frequency components; i.e., coefficients α = VTx are zeros or very small for high frequencies. The smoothest signal is the constant vector 1—the first eigenvector v1 for L corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue λ1 = 0. Note that v1 = 1 has no zero-crossings, and higher frequency components vk have increasingly more zero-crossings according to the nodal domain theorem [37].\nMathematically, we can write that a signal x is smooth if its graph Laplacian regularizer xTLx is small [10], [11]. Graph Laplacian regularizer can be expressed as:\nxTLx = ∑\n(i,j)∈E wi,j (xi − xj)2 = ∑ k λk α 2 k (3)\nBecause L is PSD, xTLx is lower-bounded by 0. The graph Laplacian regularizer is related to the Rayleigh quotient R(x), which reaches its minimum at the smallest eigenvalue λmin when x = v1,\nλmin = R(v1) = vT1 Lv1 vT1 v1\n(4)\nWe can equivalently express the graph Laplacian regularizer as a signal prior in a Bayesian formulation; i.e., the probability Pr(x) of observing a signal x is:\nPr(x) ∝ exp ( −x TLx\nσ2\n) (5)\nwhere σ is a parameter. Note that because vT1 Lv1 = 0, the first eigenvector v1 has the largest probability Pr(v1)."

Suppose we are given a partial observation y ∈ RK of the desired graph-signal x ∈ RN , where K < N . The observation y may be corrupted by an additive noise z ∈ RK , where z is zero-mean Gaussian noise with covariance Q. The noise model for y is thus:\ny = Hx + z (6)\nwhere H ∈ {0, 1}K×N is a binary matrix that extracts the K components from x corresponding to y. Given the noise model (6), we can define a likelihood term Pr(y|x):\nPr(y|x) ∝ exp ( − (y −Hx)\nTQ−1(y −Hx) σ2\n) (7)\nGiven prior (5) and likelihood (7), we can formulate a MAP problem where instead of posterior Pr(x|y), we maximize the\n4 product Pr(y|x)Pr(x), or equivalently, minimize its negative log, resulting in:\nmin x\n(y −Hx)TQ−1(y −Hx) + µ xTLx (8)\nwhere µ is a parameter that trades off the importance between the likelihood term and the signal prior. For example, for the special case where x is a classifier signal and the observed labels y are noiseless, then Q is the identity matrix, and µ can be assigned a small value, so that (8) prioritizes the likelihood (fidelity) term much more than the smoothness prior term.\nBecause both terms in (8) are quadratic, (8) has a closedform optimal solution by taking the derivative with respect to x and setting it to 0:\nx∗ = ( HTQ−1H + µL )−1 HTQ−1y (9)\nBecause of its simplicity in formulation and available closedform solution, this was the approach taken in previous graphsignal restoration work [10], [11], [19], [20]. In this paper, we would also like to retain this classical MAP formulation as much as possible.\nBy considering also negative edge weights in our work, negative eigenvalues λk are possible, and xTLx can be negative. That means xTLx can no longer be used as a prior for MAP formulation (8), because if v1 computes to vT1 Lv1 < 0, then ∞v1 would be a pathological optimal solution. This is another motivation to search for a perturbation matrix ∆ such that L + ∆ is PSD, so that prior xT (L + ∆)x can be used to formulate a numerically stable MAP problem in (8)."

      "text" : "While our to-be-discussed optimization algorithm is applicable for any undirected graph with positive and negative edge weights, proper assignment of negative edges makes a big difference in actual classification performance. We discuss our edge assignment procedure in a graph G here.\nWe first construct a graph G with nodes V representing N samples. For each sample i, we compute a feature vector hi of some dimension D. Then we can assign non-negative edge weight wi,j using a Gaussian kernel:\nwi,j = exp\n( − (hi − hj)\nTΞ(hi − hj) σ2h\n) (10)\nwhere σh is a parameter. Ξ is a D×D diagonal matrix, where Ξi,i is a feature parameter for the i-th feature. We can assign positive edge weights wi,j to the ω’s nearest neighbors j to node i, while the rest of the nodes have no edges3 to i.\nThis weight assignment is similar to those in previous works on spectral clustering [38] and graph-based classifier learning [5], [8], where a closer distance in the D-dimensional feature space leads to a larger edge weight. To improve clustering / classification performance, a feature parameter Ξi,i is set larger if the i-th feature is more discriminate. For more detailed optimization of feature parameters Ξi,i—which is not the focus of this paper—see [39].\n3If this relationship is not symmetric, i.e., if i is one of ω closest neighbors to j but j is not one of ω closest neighbors to i, then we keep edge (i, j) of weight wi,j anyway. Thus each node has ≥ ω neighbors.\nWe next assign negative edges into G as follows. We perform clustering on G to find 2k clusters if k negative edges are targeted for insertion. For each cluster, we identify a centroid, and we connect pairs of centroids that are furthest in weighted feature distance with edges of negative weights (e.g. −1). The intuition is that, to maximize classification performance, each negative edge should affect labeling of a maximum number of similar nodes in the neighborhood, hence connecting cluster centroids with large feature distance is reasonable.\nNote also that, in general, more negative edges mean the graph Laplacian L is more indefinite, thus requiring larger perturbation ∆ to make L+∆ PSD. Thus in practice we add only a small number of negative edges to G, that nonetheless leads to noticeable improvement in classification results, as shown in Section VII."

      "text" : "As illustration, we consider a simple example in Fig. 3(a): a 12-node graph where nodes 1 through 6 are similar and are connected by edges of weight 1, and nodes 7 to 12 are similar. Nodes between the two classes are connected by edges of weight 0.1, except pairs (2, 8) and (5, 11)—centroids of four clusters—that are connected by edges of weight −1. Graph Lapalacian L for this graph has two negative eigenvalues −0.94 and −0.76, and the corresponding eigenvectors v1 and v2 are shown in Fig. 3(b).\nWe observe that v1 exhibits the desired behavior of the ground truth classifier x already: similar nodes 1 through 6 (nodes 7 through 12) have the same sign. On the other hand, while v2 have values of opposite sign at connected pairs (2, 8) and (5, 11), which are consistent with the two negative edges, values at connected pairs (3, 4) and (9, 10) have opposite signs, which are not consistent with the corresponding positive edges. Thus for signal restoration, information-rich eigenvectors V should ideally be preserved, and since v1 is more valuable than v2, it should be weighted accordingly in the regularizer. We will return to this point in the next section.\nWe observe also that if we assign two negative edges at node pairs across the two classes different from (2, 8) and (5, 11), then λmin would have a strictly larger magnitude. For example, assigning −1 to edges (1, 7) and (6, 12) (and 0.1 to edges (2, 8) and (5, 11)) would result in λmin = −1.32. It turns out that connecting cluster centroids of the two classes\n5 with negative edges tends to result in the smallest magnitude λmin, and thus the smallest perturbation ∆ required to make L + ∆ PSD. This provides an explanation why our proposed negative edge assignment based on cluster centroids leads to the best classification performance on average."

Assume that L has exactly p negative eigenvalues. Theorem 5.1 in [40] states that the optimal perturbation matrix ∆ with minimum norm ‖∆‖, such that L + ∆ is PSD, is:\n∆ = V diag(τ ) VT (13)\nwhere τ = [τ1, . . . , τn]:\nτi = { −λi if 1 ≤ i ≤ p 0 o.w.

As discussed previously, maintaining the same eigen-space in the perturbed matrix L + ∆ is desirable.\nThird, by eliminating all negative eigenvalues of L to 0, the first p+ 1 eigenvectors v1, . . . ,vp will all evaluate to 0 in the quadratic regularizer:\nvTi (L + ∆) vi = 0, 1 ≤ i ≤ p+ 1 (15)\np + 1 because L contains the DC component 1 that the regularizer also evaluates to 0. Hence the regularizer expresses no preference among the first p+1 eigenvectors. This is a problem during graph-signal restoration.

Thus, it is desirable to perturb L in a way that the frequency preferences are preserved (i.e., low frequencies are still preferred over high frequencies), while the overall perturbation is minimized. We mathematically define this notion as follows.\nFirst, considering the regularizer xTLx as a scalar function of eigenvectors vi, we define the gradient differential gi— the change in gradient—for each eigenvector vi after adding perturbation matrix ∆ to L:\ngi = ∣∣∣∣∂(xTLx)∂vi − ∂(x T (L + ∆)x) ∂vi ∣∣∣∣ (16) We then define the average gradient differential ḡ for all eigenvectors vi:\nḡ = 1\nN N∑ i=1 gi (17)\nFinally, we can define our perturbation criteria as follows:\nmin ∆\n( ḡ + ρ\nn∑ i=1\n(gi − ḡ)2 )\n(18)\nsuch that the resulting perturbed matrix L + ∆ is PSD. ρ is a parameter that trades off the importance of the average gradient differential with the variance of gradient differentials. We call this criteria in (18) the minimum-variance criteria, because it seeks to minimize the difference in gradient changes among different eigenvectors.\nBecause L is a weighted sum of outer-products vjvTj , gradient of xTLx with respect to vi is:\n∂(xTLx) ∂vi = ∂ ∑ j λjx Tvjv T j x ∂vi = 2λiαivi (19)\nwhere αi is the i-th frequency coefficient of x.\n6 Assuming that the perturbed matrix L + ∆ also retains the same eigenvectors V, then the gradient differential gi can be simplified to:\ngi = |2λiαivi − 2τiαivi| = 2 |(λi − τi)αi|\nwhere τi is the i-th eigenvalue of L+∆. The last step follows because vi is an unit-norm eigenvector. Instead of considering all possible x, we make a simplifying assumption that |αi| = 1 for all i and drop the constant 2. Finaly, gi simplifies to:\ngi = |λi − τi| (20)\nIf ρ = 0, then the objective (18) becomes the minimumnorm criteria, and ∆ defined in (13) is optimal. As discussed, this solution does not differentiate among the first p + 1 frequencies vi, and thus we should set ρ to a larger value to avoid this solution.\nIf ρ is sufficiently large, then the deviation of each gi from ḡ becomes the dominant concern. To construct a solution for this case, we define a generalized graph Laplacian matrix Lg [37] as the sum of L and an identity matrix5 I scaled by −λmin:\nLg = −λminI + L (21) = V(−λmin)I VT + VΛVT\n= V (−λminI + Λ) VT (22)\nwhere λmin is the smallest eigenvalue in L.

It has two steps as described below.\nStep 1: We first partition node set N t in Lt into two subsets N t1 and N t2 , where |N t1 | = r. r is a pre-defined parameter to control computation complexity. N t1 can be chosen by first randomly selecting a node in N t, then perform breadth-first search (BFS) [43] until r nodes are discovered. We eigendecompose Lt1,1 to find its smallest eigenvalue λ t 1.

At a leaf recursive call τ , in Step 1, Lτ is perturbed using computed κτmin such that Lτ1,1 = Lτ1,1 − κτminI is PD. In Step 2, if computed λτ2 ≥ 0, then SC Lτ/Lτ1,1 is PSD.

It turns out that if we perturb Lτ again using λτ2 , i.e., L′τ = Lτ −λτ2I, then L′τ is PSD. This is because L′τ1,1 = Lτ1,1−λτ2I is PD, and its SC L′τ/L′τ1,1 is PSD by the following lemma:\nLemma 1. If L1,1 is PD and L/L1,1 + δI is PSD for δ > 0, then SC L′/L′1,1, where L ′ = L + δI, is also PSD.\nSee Appendix for a full proof. In this case λτmin = κ τ min +\nλτ2 , hence λ τ min is a lower bound for L τ . Consider now the inductive case, where at iteration t we assume that, ηtmin := EvalBound(L t+1, t + 1) is a lower bound for Lt+1 = Lt/Lt1,1. From Step 1, we know that Lt is perturbed using κtmin so that Lt1,1 = Lt1,1 − κtminI is PD. By assumption, we know that Lt/Lt1,1 can be perturbed using ηtmin such that Lt/Lt1,1 − ηtminI is PSD. By Lemma 1, we know that Lt− ηtminI is also PSD. Thus λtmin := κtmin + ηtmin is a lower bound for Lt.\nSince both the base case and the inductive case are proven, the recursion invariant is also proven, and EvalBound(L, 0) returns a lower bound for λmin of L."

Specifically, positive edge graph Laplacian L+ is related to the second derivative of continuous functions [7], and so L+x computes the second-order difference on graph-signal x. As an example, the 3-node line graph in Fig. 2 with all edge weights equal to 1 has the following L+:\nL+ =  1 −1 0−1 2 −1 0 −1 1  (36) Using the second row L+2,: of L\n+, we can compute the secondorder difference at node x2:\nL+2,:x = −x1 + 2x2 − x3 (37)\nOn the other hand, the definition of second derivative8 of a function f(x) is:\nf ′′(x) = lim h→0 f(x+ h)− 2f(x) + f(x− h) h2\n(38)\nWe see that (37) and (38) are computing the same quantity (with a sign change) in the limit.\n8https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second derivative\nHence if |L+x| is small, then the second-order difference of x is small, or the first-order difference of x is smooth or changing slowly. In other words, the gradient of the signal is smooth with respect to the graph. We express this notion by stating that the square of the l2-norm of L+x is small:\n‖L+x‖22 = xT (L+)TL+x = xT (L+)2x = ∑ i (λ+i ) 2α2i\n(39) where (39) is true since L+ is symmetric by definition.\n2) Negative Edges for Generalized Smoothness: We illustrate now why negative edge weights should not be used when considering generalized smoothness. Consider again the threenode line graph in Fig. 2, where w = 1. The corresponding second row of the graph Laplacian L is:\nL2,: = [ 1 0 −1 ]\n(40)\nThis means that when we compute the generalized smoothness |Lx| at x2, we get |L2,:x| = |x1 − x3|; i.e., the generalized smoothness at x2 does not actually depend on the value of x2! We provide an intuitive explanation why negative edge weights should not be used next."

      "text" : "It has been shown that by interpreting an undirected weighted graph G as an electrical circuit, one can gain additional insights [34], [35], [42], [44]. We follow a similar approach when attempting to understand generalized smoothness. Suppose we interpret an edge (i, j) as a wire between nodes i and j, and an edge weight wi,j as conductance (equivalently, 1/wi,j as the resistance) between its two endpoints. Let xi and xj represent the voltage at the two endpoints. According to Ohm’s law9, the current ci,j between the two nodes is the voltage difference at the entpoints times the conductance:\nci,j = wi,j(xi − xj) (41)\nBy Kirchhoff’s current law10 (KCL), the net sum of the currents flowing into a node is zero. Applying KCL to node 2 in the three-node line graph in Fig. 2 connected by weights w1,2 and w2,3, we can write:\nw1,2(x1 − x2) + w2,3(x3 − x2) = 0 (42)\nusing Ohm’s law (41). If we desire a signal x to satisfy this condition maximally, we can minimize the absolute value of this current sum:\nmin x ∣∣[ −w1,2 (w1,2 + w2,3) −w2,3 ] x∣∣ = ∣∣L+2,:x∣∣ (43) This is in fact the generalized graph-signal smoothness condition we discussed in Section VI-B. Thus we can conclude the following: a graph-signal x on graph G that is perfectly generalized smooth, i.e. |L+x| = 0, is a voltage signal on G that satisfies KCL.\nThis electrical network interpretation also provides an argument why negative edges should not be considered for\n9https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s law 10https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s circuit laws\n9 generalized smoothness. As done in [42], a generalized graph Laplacian Lg with diagonal element Li,i ≥ ∑ j|j 6=i Li,j can be considered a conductance matrix, where an edge (i, j) has branch conductance −Li,j and node i has shunt conductance Li,i− ∑ j|j 6=i Li,j ≥ 0. For such a resistive circuit, Ohm’s law is applicable directly and thus KCL is meaningful. However, a negative conductance Li,j < 0 (equivalently, a negative resistance) means the circuit is no longer resistive, and Ohm’s law is not applicable. As a result, KCL—by extension generalized graph-signal smoothness—is no longer meaningful."

We know that the true signal x is indeed piecewise constant (PWC); each true label xi is binary, and labels of the same class cluster together in the same feature subspace. The graph-signal smoothness term in (5), analogous to the total variation (TV) prior [33] in image restoration [45], promotes a PWC signal x̂ during reconstruction, as empirically demonstrated in previous graph-signal restoration works [10], [11], [19], [20]. Hence the smoothness prior is appropriate.\nRecall that the purpose of TGV [22] is to avoid oversmoothing a ramp (linear increase / decrease in pixel intensity) in an image, which would happen if only a TV prior is used. A ramp in the reconstructed signal x̂ in our classification context would mean an assignment of label other than −1 and 1, which can reflect the confidence level in the estimated label; e.g., a computed label x̂i = 0.3 would mean the classifier has determined that event i is more likely to be 1 than −1, but the confidence level is not high. We can thus conclude that the generalized smoothness prior can promote an appropriate amount of ambiguity in the classification solution instead of forcing the classifier to make hard binary decisions. As a result, the mean square error (MSE) of our solution with respect to the ground truth labels is small.\nE. Iterative Reweighted Least Squares Algorithm\nTo solve (44), we employ the following optimization strategy. We first replace the l0-norm in (44) with a weighted l2norm:\nmin x\n(y−Hx)TB(y−Hx)γ + σ−20 x T Lg x + σ −2 1 x T (L+)2 x\n(45) where B is a K×K diagonal matrix with weights b1, . . . , bK on its diagonal. In other words, the fidelity term is now a weighted sum of label differences: (y−Hx)TB(y−Hx) =∑K i=1 bi(yi −Hi,:x)2. The weights bi should be set so that the weighted l2norm mimics the l0-norm. To accomplish this, we employ the iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) strategy [24], which has been proven to have superlinear local convergence, and\nsolve (45) iteratively, where the weights b(t+1)i of iteration t+ 1 is computed using solution x(t)i of the previous iteration t, i.e.,\nb (t+1) i =\n1\n(yi −Hi,:x(t))2 + (46)\nfor a small > 0 to maintain numerical stability. Using this weight update, we see that the weighted quadratic term (y − Hx)TB(y−Hx) mimics the original l0-norm ‖y −Hx‖0 in the original objective (44) when the solution x converges.\n1) Closed-Form Solution per Iteration: For a given weight matrix B, it is clear that the objective (45) is an unconstrained quadratic programming problem with three quadratic terms. One can thus derive a closed-form solution by taking the derivative with respect to x and equating it to zero, resulting in:\nx∗ = ( γHTBH + σ−20 Lg + σ −2 1 (L +)2 )−1 γHTBTy (47)\nF. Interpreting Computed Solution x̂\nAfter the IRLS algorithm converges to a solution x̂, we interpret the classification results as follows. We perform thresholding by a pre-defined value τ on x̂ to divide it into three parts, including the rejection option for ambiguous labels:\nxi =  1, x∗i > τ\nRejection, −τ < x∗i < τ −1, x∗i < −τ.\n(48)\nTypically, the fraction of tolerable rejection labels is set per application requirement. Clearly, eliminating more ambiguous labels leads to a larger tolerable rejection rate, resulting in a smaller classification error rate."

The first dataset called “Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks” contains various patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off metal cylinders and rocks at various angles (spanning 90 degrees for mines and 180 degrees for rocks) and under various conditions. Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where each number represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period of time. These patterns are used to classify whether an object is a metal cylinder or a rock.\nThe second dataset is the Banana dataset, an artificial dataset where 5300 instances belong to several clusters with a banana shape. In the dataset, two attributes were extracted to classify two kinds of banana shapes.\nThe third is the Titanic dataset that gives the values of four categorical attributes (social class, age, gender, and survival status) for each of the 2201 people on board the Titanic when it struck an iceberg and sank. This natural dataset was used\n10\nto study how survival (i.e., the two classes are survival and death) relates to the other three attributes.\nFor our experiment, we randomly sampled 210 instances from the first dataset and 300 instances from the second and third, and used 70% of the samples as training data and 30% as testing data. We repeated the process 100 times for each dataset and then calculated the average performance of the 100 experiments in terms of classification error rate.\n2) Graph Construction: To construct a graph with negative edge weights for our proposed methods, we first constructed a graph with non-negative edge weights. For each sample (node), we found its three nearest neighbors according to the Euclidean distances between the node and its neighbors, and connected these nodes using edges with non-negative weights that are normalized to [0,1] using the Gaussian kernel in (10). We performed clustering on the graph and found the centroids (chosen from labelled nodes) of clusters as explained in Section III-E. We then paired the cluster centroids with different labels, and assigned a negative edge weight between each pair with a value normalized to [−1,0] where the magnitude is inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between the pair. In the experiments, we added two negative edge weights in each constructed graph.\n3) Comparison Schemes: We tested our proposed algorithm against five schemes: i) linear SVM, ii) SVM with a RBF kernel (named SVM-RBF), iii) a more robust version of the famed AdaBoost called RobustBoost [25] that claims robustness against label noise, iv) a graph classifier with the graph-signal smoothness prior (3) where the edge weights of the graph are all positive (named Graph-Pos), and v) a graph classifier with a graph containing negative edge weights where the graph Laplacian L is perturbed by the minimum-norm perturbation criteria in (12) to eliminate negative eigenvalues for numerical stability (named Graph-MinNorm).\nWe implemented two variants of our proposed graph classifier: i) our proposed minimum-variance perturbation method (named Proposed) using the generalized graph Laplacian Lg but without the generalized smoothness term (i.e., σ−21 = 0 in (44) and τ = 0 in (48)), and vii) the proposed method in (44) with rejection (named Proposed-Rej) where the rejection rate is controlled to be within 9–10% by tuning parameters in (48)."

Table IV shows the classification error and rejection rates in “Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks” dataset for our proposed method with rejection under different training label error rates and σ−21 , where the values of τ are set the same as that used in the first row. It shows that as σ−21 for the generalized smoothness term increases, the rejection rate also increases, which is consistent with our explanation in Section VI-B that the second smoothness term promotes ambiguity in the solution instead of forcing the solution to be strictly binary. As a result, using our algorithm, one can thus tune σ−21 and τ to adjust the preference of classification error versus rejection rate.\n3) Fast computation: In Section V-C, we proposed a fast eigen-decomposition scheme to lower-bound the smallest eigenvalue λmin of the graph Laplacian L for a graph with negative edge weights.

Fig. 5 to Fig. 7 compare the actual minimum eigenvalues (denoted Proposed) and their computed lower-bounds (denoted Fast) in the first 30 out of 100 sampled data subsets for the three datasets,\nFig. 7. Comparison of the actual smallest eigenvalues and their lowerbounds using r = 70 and 100 for the Titanic dataset (N = 210), corresponding to 89% and 77%, computation reduction, respectively.\nrespectively. In the experiment, we set parameter r to be about one half and one third of the number of samples N , which correspond to about 89% and 75% computation reduction, respectively, since the computation complexity is reduced from O(N3) to O(Nr2) as explained in Section V-E.\nThe results show that λ#min computed by our proposed fast algorithm is an actual lower-bound for the true minimum eigenvalue λmin, i.e. λ # min ≤ λmin and the bound is tight most of the time. This ensures that the obtained Lg using matrix perturbation using −λ#minI is PSD, and not too far from the optimal ∆. Table V compares the classification error rates of the proposed minimum-variance perturbation method (without rejection) with the actual minimum eigenvalues with the approximation computing the lower-bound eigenvalues by our proposed fast algorithm. Results show that the fast algorithm leads to slight performance differences compared to the full computation method."

In this paper, we study this classifier learning problem from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. Specifically, by viewing a binary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal in a highdimensional feature space, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Unlike previous graph-signal restoration works, we consider in addition edges with negative weights that signify anti-correlation between samples. One unfortunate consequence is that the graph Laplacian matrix L can be indefinite, and previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior xLx for candidate signal x can lead to pathological solutions. In response, we derive an optimal perturbation matrix ∆—based on a fast lower-bound computation of the minimum eigenvalue of L via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula— so that L + ∆ is positive semi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized smoothness on graph that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally, we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that solves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms both SVM variants and graph-based classifiers using positiveedge graphs noticeably.",
