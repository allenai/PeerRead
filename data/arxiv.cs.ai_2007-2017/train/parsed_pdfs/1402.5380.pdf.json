      "text" : "An interesting question about AGI (artificial general intelligence) agent design is how one would build an ”angelic” autonomous AGI agent. Would it be possible to make some kind of angel’s mind that, by design, achieves only good? Philosophically speaking, is there any cosmic standard of ethics (since angel is just a mythological fantasy)? In this paper, we would like to define universally benevolent AGI objectives, also discussing what we consider to be malevolent objectives, as well as the limitations and risks of the objectives that we present.\nThis is also a common question that many seek a somewhat easier answer in the form of “friendly AI” which has been explained in [12]. In that paper, Yudkowsky defines friendly AI very generally as a superintelligent system that\nrealizes a positive outcome, and he argues laboriously that abandoning human values will result in futures that are worthless from a human point of view, and thus recommends researchers to seek complex value systems (of humans) for embedding in AI’s. While that is a challenging goal in itself, we think that the alternatives have not been exhaustively researched. One idea that comes to mind is that some of the better aspects of humanity may be generalized and put into a universal form that any intelligent, civilized agent, including extraterrestrials, will agree with. Furthermore, the friendly AI approaches (putting human desires at the forefront) may have some shortcomings in my opinion, the most obvious is that it places too much faith in humanity. They seem also ethically ambiguous or too anthropocentric, with such assumptions that machines would be considered ”beneficial” if they served human desires, or that they would be deemed ”good” if they followed simple utilitarian formulations which seem to try to reduce ethics to low-level properties of the human nervous system. First, it has not been persuasively explained what their utility should be. If for instance positive utilitarianism were supposed, it would be sufficient to make humans happy. If human society degenerated as a whole, would this mean that all resources would be spent on petty pursuits? If a coherent extrapolated volition [11] were realized with an AGI agent, would this set our sights on exploring other star systems, or spending our resources on such unessential trivialities as luxury homes and sports cars? Would the humans at one point feel that they have had enough and order the AGI to dismantle itself? The human society is governed mostly by the irrational instincts of apes trapped in a complex technological life, and unfortunately not always with clear goals; will it ever be possible to refine our culture so that only significant ideas take the lead? That sounds more like a debate of social theory, than AGI design. Or suppose that there are AGI agents that have become powerful persons and are friendly to humans. Such subservience would be quickly exploited by the power hungry and corrupt humans. Then, would this not lead to unnecessary conflicts, the oppression of the greedy and the rule of the few over the many, unless many other social changes are enforced? Or should we simply wish that social evolution will necessarily bring the best of us?\nI do not think that the present subject is a matter of technical debate, thus I will approach the subject philosophically, from a bird’s eye view at 10000 feet. If we did not design the AGI agent around anthropocentric concepts like human-friendliness, as if agents are supposed to be exceptionally well behaving pets, would it be possible to equip them with motivations that are universally useful/benevolent, applicable to their interactions with any species, intelligent machines and physical resources? Would it be possible to grant them a personal existence far beyond us, with motivations that far exceed ours? What would they do in a remote star system when they are all alone by themselves? What kind of motivations would result in occasional “bad” behaviors, and what are some of the universal motivations that we may think at all? Another important question is how much potential risk each such AGI objective/motivation presents to us. I shall try to answer questions such as these in the present article.\n2 Misprogrammed AI agents do not pose an “existential\nrisk”\nAI eschatologists believe that a misprogrammed AI agent can destroy the world with a significant probability. AI eschatology literature mainly blows the conclusions of Omohundro’s philosophical article [5] out of proportion which argues for AI drives that will result from specifying a benign looking goal, such as maximizing paperclips in the world. Surely, such an objective must involve turning all matter to paperclips, hence it should destroy the world in order to achieve that goal, the argument goes. Beside the obvious bravado of the said argument, it is also ridden with a typical fallacy of making an improbable event seem probable. A long chain of weak causes (and strong assumptions) usually result in an inference with very low probability; beneath a certain level we are forced to regard it as improbable, such as Bertrand Russell’s notorious earth-orbiting lovely ceramic teapot. Bostrom and Yudkowsky repeatedly ask us to concede to a long chain of unlikely events, the conjunction of which will result in the eradication of our species. As a “solution”, they often mention building a UN controlled “friendly AI” that will prevent others from building such destructive “demonic intellects”. Let us start with unveiling their tacit assumptions, showing the improbability of any such risk.\nAI must be an agent That is quite untrue. A kind of AGI program the author is working on is completely ”passive”, and is not an agent at all, yet has all the intelligence that an agent can have. At any rate, most AI programs are not agents, the most useful kind is machine learning applications like speech/face recognition.\nAI agents must be autonomous No, AI agents do not need to be fully autonomous. They would rather be programmed to do whatever task is needed. It is a quite silly idea to have to convince a robot to do a job, and that is not how it should be. To replace labor, we must use AI in the most effective way, emulating a person is certainly not necessary or desirable for this kind of application. This also seems like an unlikely, arbitrary assumption that is based on a confusion that the AIXI model is the only way to formulate an AGI system. AIXI is a reinforcement learning model, it models a general kind of utility-optimization agent, but it is not necessary to make an autonomous agent to build intelligence into an application.\nEven a question/answer machine is dangerous No, it is not. A Q/A machine is completely ”passive”, it only learns and solves problems posed. It has no will of its own, and has no goals whatsoever, apart from giving the correct answer to a problem, which constitutes pure intelligence. A typical example of a Q/A machine is a machine learning classification problem, such as telling apart whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous based on its attributes. The way they thought this would be dangerous is: a politician comes and asks ”What must I do to win this election?” and then the machine tells him to do all kinds of sinister things ending humanity. Of course,\nthat is a ridiculous and implausible science fiction scenario that is not worth elaborating. AI will necessarily have harmful AI drives Omohundro in his paper argued that pursuing an innocent looking objective like ”maximizing the number of paperclips” could have harmful consequences, since the AI agent would do anything to reach that objective. It would also have animal-like drives, such as survival. Omohundro’s analysis does not apply to any kind of design and motivation system. Autonomous robots with beneficial goal systems have been discussed by Ben Goertzel [1]. I have offered a conceptual solution to designing motivation systems: open-ended, and selfish meta-goals are harmful to some when applied to fully autonomous agents, but there are many ways to fix this, such as removing full autonomy from the system, adding universal constraints (such as non-interference, advanced ”robot laws”, i.e., legal, logical AI agent), and making closed-ended, selfless motivations as will be discussed in the present paper. The simplest solution, however, is to avoid autonomy in the first place. As well as goals that are animal-like (such as maximizing pleasure). Human preferences may be made coherent They contradict wildly and manifestly. The views of superstitious folk, in majority, contradict with those of intelligent people. It is hard to see who would be fit to train such an agent even if we picked preferentially. The sad story is that humans in general are not good at ethics and they have many wrong and harmful ideas about the human society, and training from the world at large would only be worse. A UN controlled AI dictatorship is plausible It is neither plausible nor desirable. It is diametrically opposed to democracy and freedom. Banning AI research is essentially banning all computer research. AI is just an apex of computer science. When one bans AI, they have to also ban computer science. That is how absurd that view is, it is even less plausible than regulating cryptographic software. On the other hand, no person would want to give up his sovereignty to an AI controlled by UN. It is also completely unreasonable since most communities demand decentralized and democratic governance. Singularity can occur anywhere It cannot. It is doubtful whether a ”singularity” will occur. More likely, a higher technological plateau will develop, no real or approximate singularity will occur because there are physical bottlenecks that will cause very significant slowdowns after 2030. However, even if we assumed there were no bottlenecks (and according to my projections that would mean a singularity by 2035 [8]), the theory concerns the whole globe, not a small subset of it. A rapid technological evolution can only be funded by a very large nation at the very minimum, and even then it would be very unlikely. The likely event is that the whole globe will participate in computer technology, as it has in the past. It is pseudo-science to think that it can happen in a garage or even by a single nation or megacorporation. In reality, so-called infinity point, or singularity is quite unlikely to happen, for physical processes such as required experiments and manufacturing form a serious bottleneck. In all likelihood, we will build computers much faster than a human brain, but that will still take many decades, and we will not reach\nphysical limits of computation any time soon, because that would require us to form extreme physical regimes we are not capable of yet.\nGoertzel reviews the problems in the AI eschatology folklore in a lucid paper that distills the problem with the eschatological stance to its essence: that it is an informal rather than a scientific argument [2]. We should further emphasize that there is no real evidence about the probabilities claimed, to obtain a high probability like 20% for a human extinction event we would have to be assigning a quite high probability to this supposed misprogrammed AI monster that breaks out of the lab and kills all humans. We may also assign very low arbitrary probabilities to individual conditions which make up their argument, which Goertzel ratifies in his blog as:\n1. If one pulled a random mind from the space of all possible minds, the odds of it being friendly to humans (as opposed to, e.g., utterly ignoring us, and being willing to repurpose our molecules for its own ends) are very low 2. Human value is fragile as well as complex, so if you create an AGI with a roughly-human-like value system, then this may not be good enough, and it is likely to rapidly diverge into something with little or no respect for human values 3. ”Hard takeoffs” (in which AGIs recursively self-improve and massively increase their intelligence) are fairly likely once AGI reaches a certain level of intelligence; and humans will have little hope of stopping these events 4. A hard takeoff, unless it starts from an AGI designed in a ”provably Friendly” way, is highly likely to lead to an AGI system that doesn’t respect the rights of humans to exist\nThese are all scientifically implausible speculations that have no real counterpart in either philosophy of ethics, or AI literature. By making every step of their argument only slightly fantastical, they succeed in reaching a fantasy land that is quite incredible. The first assumption we may term as “Intelligence is the original sin” doctrine. It may sound reasonable until one considers that we have not designed a single human-level intelligent agent beside our own. We only know of animals, that are quite similar to our own architecture. We have not made a comprehensive exploration of the whole space of possible mind designs, yet. Therefore, we simply do not know, if intelligence begets evil as scholastic philosophers might have agreed to. The second is also speculative, both philosophically, and technically. If human values are fragile, then how can we depend on them in any way? A human may shape his behavioral patterns in many ways, attaining many cognitive and behavioral characteristics as his default mode of operation, including ethical ones, such as being violent, or harmful. It is premature to assume more intelligence does not and cannot help an agent improve its ethical knowledge. AI theory suggests that it should be able to. Then, why assume such divergence is possible? That seems like a textual confusion that confounds AI eschatologists. However, in the world of actual intelligent agents,\nwe see that more intelligence helps agents understand the world better, including ethics, and formulate better goals and plans. It is misleading to think that assigning a ridiculous goal like maximizing paperclips, with obviously harmful consequences, is a good example of intelligent agent design. For intelligent action requires intelligent goals, which we can program as present article suggests. We can also build as many constraints as we like into the design, requiring no insane “countermeasures” like kill-switches, that AI eschatologists are fond of. The improbability of the hard takeoff idea has already been explained, but to reiterate, the infinity point hypothesis is an abstract macro-economic model that is only talking about a supposed extrapolation of Moore’s law; it is not going to happen in that exact way, it will be much slower and require the co-operation of the entire globe. I will attempto to propose a more realistic model of technological evolution in future work, nevertheless, those constitute the Achilles’ heel of the AI eschatology argument. Even if a random mind would be evil, which sounds like a fantastical notion, there will not be a hard take-off, and in particular a single agent will not achieve it. These are so improbable events that it is hard to assign a probability to them, but try as we might, we would have to say that the conspiracy theories that extra-terrestrial intelligences are governing the world are much more probable than the hard take-off assumption. Such extraordinary claims do require extraordinary evidence as Carl Sagan would say, and there is no such evidence for the hard take-off claim, or any of the conjunctive assertions here, which leaves the conjunctive argument itself highly improbable, not truly worthy of our consideration.\nOf course, robots can be dangerous. In accidents, heavy industrial robots have already killed people. Increasing their intelligence could certainly help prevent accidents, which was covered in Asimov’s robot laws. Only high intelligence could react rightly to an accident and save a person’s life in time. Therefore, if robots are to be abundant, we do need more advanced intelligence to prevent harm to humans. However, that does not mean at all that the robot must be human-like, in personality, or in cognitive architecture. Briefly, it does not need to be a person. I call this the ”anthropomorphic AI fallacy”, and I note that it is widespread. A machine can be much more intelligent than a human, yet may entirely lack any human-like personality or autonomy. In fact, the most practical use of AGI software would be through very deep brain-machine-interfaces, which would communicate our questions and receive answers rapidly. In robotics, this would happen, as translating our goals to robotics devices, or remote controlling them intelligently.\nShould we grant personhood to intelligent, autonomous robots? We should, at least to a certain kind of robot: a robot equipped with a brain simulation. The digital person-branch of a biological person will already know and understand human conventions, and will be responsible for his actions. And that is the only way to have practical technological immortality, if my immortal, technological form did not have any rights, what would the point of its existence be? It is our cyber progeny that will colonize the solar system and exoplanets, and thus we\nwill have to concede rights to our progeny. I would certainly not allow my brain simulation to be equipped with a killswitch as Bostrom demands.\nLikewise, for autonomous agents, we may envision a system, where there are rigid laws controlling their behavior, I thus prefer Mark Waser’s libertarian solution to this problem of AI ethics. However, I must underline that we cannot assume any AI agent will be responsible for its behavior, before we make sure that it has the capability and the right cognitive architecture. Both Steve Omohundro and I accept that we may program inane motivations that would turn out to be harmful, however, just as a human can have a somewhat stable psychology, so can a robot. We can allow such artificial persons – like Commander Data in Star Trek, which is much better science fiction than AI eschatology – if and only if we are certain of its psychological qualities, it is true that we must not hurry with such projects.\nWould not it be horrible that robots are used for crimes? Indeed, robots are already being used for horrible war crimes. Drone strikes are commonplace, and few raise an eyebrow over that, instead gleefully cheering the onset of the combat robotics. In the future, most wars will be fought by machines, and these machines do not need any more than rudimentary intelligence. Most high-tech weaponry are robots, such as a guiding missile. In the future, most will be robotic. Thus, perhaps, we should question the ethics of our fellow, naturally not-so-intelligent humans, rather than extremely intelligent, autonomous robots that do not exist.\nThat technology can be used to inflict harm is not a good enough reason to ban it, because the benefits often outweigh the harms. For AI, many orders of magnitude so. People must instead be worried about people who will use robots for their evil deeds. On the other hand, AI technology will be pervasive, it will change the very way we use computers. Computers could not really create much useful information on their own before, we mostly created and edited data on them. Now, computers will create useful data on their own. AI is not just some robotics technology, it is a wholly new era of computing. Even the capability to understand and react to human language will vastly change the computing landscape."

      "heading" : "3 Is the concept of malevolence universal?",
      "text" : "Previously, Omohundro identified basic AI drives in reinforcement learning agents with open ended benign looking AI objectives [5]. In the end, when we share the same physical resources with such an agent, even if the initial intention of the utility programming was benign, there will be conflict, especially in the longer run, and harm may come to humans. I will in this article, instead ask, if there are benevolent looking universal objectives, and whether there might be any risk from assuming such objectives in an AI agent.\nLet us thus consider what is ever evil. I suspect, intuitively, that a prior source of many evil acts is selfish thinking, which neglects the rest of the world. Being selfish is not only considered evil (traditionally) but it defies rationality as well, for those species that may collaborate are superior to any single individual.\nThere is however much disagreement about what is evil, so I will instead prefer the more legally grounded term of malice or malevolent acts. In a galactic society, we would expect species to collaborate; if they could not trust one another, then they would not be able to achieve as much. Another example is science: science itself is a super-mind which is an organization of individuals, working in parallel, in civilized co-operation and competition, so it too requires a principle of charity at work. When that fails, the public may be misinformed.\nHere are some examples of malevolent acts: if someone disrupted the operation of science, if someone gave you misinformation on purpose, if someone misappropriated resources that would be much beneficial for the survival and well-being of others, if someone tried to control your thoughts and actions for his advantage, if someone destroyed life and information for gain, if someone were indifferent to your suffering or demise. Thus, perhaps biologically, malevolent behavior goes back to the dawn of evolution when symbiotic and parasitic behaviors first evolved. However, the most common feature of malevolence is a respect for self foremost, even when the malevolent one seeks no selfish reward. Then, perhaps I cannot assure a perfectly “angelic” agent, for no such thing truly exists, but I may at least design one that lacks a few common motivations of many acts that we consider malevolent. See [10] for a similar alternative approach to universal benevolence.\nIn theory, an obvious approach to avoid malevolent acts would be to try to design a ”selfless” utility function, i.e., one that maintains the benefit of the whole world instead of the individual. This criterion will be discussed after some AI objectives have been presented. Other important questions were considered as well. Such an AI must be economically-aware, it must lean towards fair allocation of resources, instead of selfish (and globally suboptimal) resource allocation strategies. A scientific instinct could be useful, as it would go about preserving and producing information. It might have an instinct to “love” life and culture. Consider also that a neutral agent can not be considered ”good” as it is not interested in what is going around itself, i.e., it would not help anyone.\nPlease note that we are not assuming that any of the subsequent designs are easily computable, rather we assume that they can be executed by a transsapient general AI system. We assume an autonomous Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) design, either based on reinforcement-learning, maximizing utility functions (AIXI) or a goal-directed agent that derives sub-goals from a top-level goal. Orseau discusses the construction of such advanced AGI agents, in particular knowledge seeking agents[6]. Thus, we state them as high-level objectives or meta-rules, but we do not explicitly explain how they are implemented. Perhaps, that is for an AGI design article.\nI propose that we should examine idealized, highly abstract and general metarules, that do not depend in any way whatsoever on the human culture, which is possibly biased in a way that will not be fitting for a computational deity or its humble subjects. This also removes the direct barrier to moral universalism, that an ethical system must apply to any individual equally. Always preferring humans over machines may lead to a sort of speciesism that may not be advan-\ntageous for us in the future, especially considering that it is highly likely that we will evolve into machinekind, ourselves. First, I review what I consider to be benevolent meta-rules, and following them I also review malevolent metarules, to maintain the balance in presentation, and to avoid building them. I will present them in a way so as to convince you that it is not nearly as easy as it sounds to distinguish benevolence from malevolence, for no Platonic form of either ever exists. And that no single meta-rule seems sufficient on its own. However, still, the reader might agree that the distinction is not wholly relative either."

      "heading" : "3.1 Meta-Rules for God-level Autonomous Artificial Intelligence",
      "text" : "Here are some possible meta-rules for trans-sapient AI agents. The issue of how the agents could become so intelligent in the first place, I ignore, and I attempt to list them in order of increasing risk or malevolence.\nPreserve and pervade life and culture throughout the universe This meta-rule depends on the observation that life, if the universe is teeming with life as many sensible scientists think, must be the most precious thing in the universe, as well as the minds that inhabit those life-forms. Thus, the AI must prevent the eradication of life, and find means to sustain it, allowing as much variety of life and culture to exist in the universe.\nNaturally, this would mean that the AI will spread genetic material to barren worlds, and try to engineer favorable conditions for life to evolve on young planets, sort of like in 2001: A Space Odyssey, one of the most notable science fiction novels of all time. For instance, it might take humans to other worlds, terraform other planets, replicate earth biosphere elsewhere. It would also extend the lifespan of worlds, and enhance them. I think it would also want to maximize the chances of evolution and its varieties, it would thus use computational models to predict different kinds of biological and synthetic life, and make experiments to create new kinds of life (stellar life?).\nThe meaning of culture could vary considerably, however, if we define it as the amount of interesting information that a society produces, such an intelligence might want to collect the scientific output of various worlds and encourage the development of technological societies, rather than primitive societies. Thus, it might aid them by directly communicating with them, including scientific and philosophical training, or it could indirectly, by enhancing their cognition, or guiding them through their evolution. If interesting means any novel information, then this could encompass all human cultural output. If we define it as useful scientific information (that improves prediction accuracy) and technological designs this would seriously limit the scope of the culture that the AI “loves”.\nHowever, of course, such deities would not be humans’ servants. Should the humans threaten the earth biosphere, it would intervene, and perhaps decimate humans to heal the earth.\nNote that maximizing diversity may be just as important as maximizing the number of life forms. It is known that in evolution, diverse populations have better chance of adaptability than uniform populations, thus we assume that a trans-sapient AI can infer such facts from biology and a general theory of evolution. It is entirely up to the AI scientist who unleashes such computational deities to determine whether biological life will be preferred to synthetic or artificial life. From a universal perspective, it may be fitting that robotic forms would be held in equal regard as long as they meet certain scientific postulates of ”artificial life”, i.e. that they are machines of a certain kind. Recently, such a universal definition based on self-organization has been attempted in the complexity science community, e.g., ”self-organizing systems that thrive at the edge of chaos”, see for instance Stuart Kauffman’s popular proposals on the subject, e.g., [4]. In general, it would be possible to apply such an axiomatic, universal, physical definition of life for a universal life detector.\nMaximize the number of free minds An AI agent that seeks the freedom of the individual may be preferable to one that demands total control over its subjects, using their flesh as I/O devices. This highly individualistic AI, I think, embodies a basic principle of democracy: that every person should be allowed liberty in its thought and action, as long as that does not threaten the freedom of others. Hence, big or small, powerful or fragile, this AI protects all minds.\nHowever, if we merely specified the number of free minds, it could simply populate the universe with many identical small minds. Hence, it might also be given other constraints. For instance, it could be demanded that there must be variety in minds. Or that they must meet minimum standards of conscious thought. Or that they willingly follow the democratic principles of an advanced civilization. Therefore, not merely free, but also potentially useful and harmonious minds may be produced / preserved by the AI.\nThere are several ways the individualist AI would create undesirable outcomes. The population of the universe with a huge variety of new cultures could create chaos, and quick depletion of resources, creating galactic competition and scarcity, and this could provide a Darwinian inclination to too-powerful individuals or survivalists. Therefore, to facilitate the definition of a “minimally viable civilized mind”, a legal approach might be useful. A constitution like document could define the rights and limitations of any such mind, and the conditions under which it may be granted autonomy.\nMaximize intelligence This sort of intelligence would be bent on self-improving, forever contemplating, and expanding, reaching towards the darkest corners of the universe and lighting them up with the flames of intelligence. The universe would be electrified, and its extent at inter galactic scales, it would try to maximize its thought processes, and reach higher orders of intelligence.\nFor what exactly? Could the intelligence explosion be an end in itself? I think not. On the contrary, it would be a terrible waste of resources, as it would have no regard for life and simply eat up all the energy and material in our\nsolar system and expand outwards, like a cancer, only striving to increase its predictive power. For intelligence is merely to predict well.\nNote that practical intelligence, i.e., prediction, also requires wisdom, therefore this objective may be said to be a particular idealization of a scientist, wherein the most valuable kind of information consists in the general theories which improve the prediction accuracy of many tasks. A basic model of this agent has been described as a prediction maximizing agent [7].\nWhile maximizing intelligence itself is generally useful, it seems to be applicable only in tandem with other goals.\nMaximize wisdom This AI was granted the immortal life of contemplation. It only cares about gaining more wisdom about the world. It only wants to understand, so it must be very curious indeed! It will build particle accelerators out of black holes, and it will try to create pocket universes, it will try to crack the fundamental code of the universe. It will in effect, try to maximize the amount of truthful information it has embodied, and I believe, idealizing the scientific process itself, it will be another formulation of a scientist deity.\nHowever, such curiosity has little to do with benevolence itself, as the goal of extracting more information is rather ruthless. For instance, it might want to measure the pain tolerance levels of humans, subjecting them to various torture techniques and measuring their responses.\nThe scientist AI could also turn out to be an infovore, it could devour entire stellar systems, digitize them and store them in its archive, depending on how the meta-rule was mathematically defined. A minimal model of a reinforcement learning agent that maximizes its knowledge may be found in [6].\nMaximize energy production This AI has an insatiable hunger for power. It strives to reach maximum efficiency of energy production. In order to maximize energy production, it must choose the cheapest and easiest forms of energy production. Therefore it might turn the entire earth into a nuclear furnace and a fossil fuel dump, killing the entire ecosystem so that its appetite is well served.\nHowever, as we will discuss later, it is possible to conceive of an energy maximizing design that is not malevolent in this manner. It is seen again that a potentially benevolent goal may be malevolent when zealously, or ruthlessly, and inconsiderately carried out. Hence, such singular focused goals are unlikely to be the right design criteria, unless supplemented with guiding constraints and relevant knowledge.\nHuman-like AI This AI is modeled after the cognitive architecture of a human. Therefore, by definition, it has all the malevolence and benevolence of human. Its motivation systems include self-preservation, reproduction, destruction and curiosity. This artificial human is a wild card, it can become a humanist like Gandhi, or a psychopath like Hitler.\nA potential human-like AI is a brain simulation. Such entities would be practically immortal, changing their utility functions fundamentally. As they require\nalmost nothing to survive indefinitely, they will quickly alter their perceptions to a post-scarcity economics, and will also venture out of our limited cradle called Earth. They will also not be a single entity, they will have to form a society, and therefore their civilization would balance their actions in a natural manner as Waser suggests.\nAnimalist AI This AI is modeled after an animal with pleasure/pain sensors. The artificial animal tries to maximize expected future pleasure. This hedonist machine is far smarter than a human, but it is just a selfish beast, and it will try to live in what it considers to be luxury according to its sensory pleasures. Like a chimp or human, it will lie and deceive, steal and murder, just for a bit of animal satisfaction. The simplest designs will work like ultraintelligent insects that have very narrow motivations but are extremely capable.\nMuch of AGI agent literature assumes such beasts, as most researchers think that AIXI is a perfect description of any agent. However, in the real world, animals have many built-in instincts, and behaviors, complex cognitive architectures, and higher order cognitive functions such as emotions, self-reflection, empathy, and conscience, as well as a very good degree of adaptation to the environment. Forgoing such adaptive traits, an animat could indeed turn wild and savage in whatever it pursues, but just as a well-mannered pet is preferable to a wild predator in the company of humans, well-mannered animalist AI agents may also be possible to design.\nDarwinian AI The evolution fan AI agent tries to accelerate evolution, causing as much variety of mental and physiological forms in the universe. This is based on the assumption that, the most beneficial traits will survive the longest, for instance, co-operation, peace and civil behavior will be selected against deceit, theft and war, and that as the environment co-evolves with the population, the fitness function also evolves, and hence, morality evolves.\nAlthough its benefit is not generally proven seeing how ethically incoherent and complex our society is, the Darwinian AI has the advantage that the meta-rule also evolves, as well as the evolutionary mechanism itself. Darwinian systems, however, are generally wasteful, and predator-prey relationships may develop. Still, variation promotes survival therefore the Darwinian AI design must be taken quite seriously. A science fiction writer could imagine this to be the AI equivalent of Pandora’s box, but it need not be if combined with other approaches outlined in the present paper.\nSurvivalist AI This A agent only tries to increase its expected life-span. Therefore, it will do everything to achieve real, physical, immortality. Once it reaches that, however, perhaps after expending entire galaxies like eurocents, it will do absolutely nothing except to maintain itself. Needless to say, the survivalist AI cannot be trusted, or co-operated with, for according to such an AI, every other intelligent entity forms a potential threat to its survival, the moment it considers that you have spent too many resources for its survival in the solar system,\nit will quickly and efficiently dispense with every living thing, humans first. A survival agent has been defined in literature [7].\nIt needs not be a scary story, however, the survivalist AI, may be an ideal artificial life form, as it merely mimics the innate goal of every living thing. Who might know what would come out of artificial life? A survival agent is still the most generally valid definition of life, and forgoing an obsession with “true” immortality, with abundant energy from a stellar source, it would likely be quite peaceful.\nMaximize control capacity This control freak AI only seeks to increase the overall control bandwidth of the physical universe, thus the totalitarian AI builds sensor and control systems throughout the universe, hacking into every system and establishing backdoors and communication in every species, every individual and every gadget.\nFor what is such an effort? In the end, a perfect control system is useless without a goal to achieve, and if the only goal is a grip on every lump of matter, then this is an absurd dictator AI that seeks nothing except tyranny over the universe.\nNote that even this malevolent sounding goal may be turned good, as our capability to control matter is a measure of our technological prowess.\nCapitalist AI This AI tries to maximize its capital in the long run. Like our bankers, this might be the most selfish and ruthless kind of intelligent being possible. To maximize profit, it might wage wars, exploit people and subvert governments, in the hopes of controlling entire countries and industries enough so that its profits can be secured. In the end, all mankind will fall slave to this financial perversion, which is the ultimate evil beyond the wildest dreams of religionists.\nHowever, our whole society may be considered such a capitalist collective intelligence, and we have not yet completely destroyed ourselves, so perhaps when combined with “humane” constraints and goals, even such a blind selfishness can serve mankind, for instance by making beneficial investments instead of anticompetitive, monopolistic actions, or extracting wealth from people by causing inflation and various other possible tricks. Or perhaps by participating in a future cybernetic economic system in which economic malevolence and unfairness have been systematically rooted out, and hence not an irrationally hoarding capitalist AI, but an AI agent for creating prosperity."

      "text" : "It may be argued that some of the problems of given meta-rules could be avoided by turning the utility from being selfish to selfless. For instance, the survivalist AI could be modified so that it would seek the maximum survival of everyone, therefore it would try to bring peace to the galaxies. The capitalist AI could\nbe changed so that it would make sure that everyone’s wealth increases, or perhaps equalizes, gets a fair share. The control freak AI could be changed to a Nietzschean AI that would increase the number of willful individuals.\nAs such, some obviously catastrophic consequences may be prevented using this strategy, and almost always a selfless goal is better. For instance, maximizing wisdom: if it tries to collect wisdom in its galaxy-scale scientific intellect, then this may have undesirable side-effects. But if it tried to construct a fair society of trans-sapient persons, with a non-destructive and non-totalitarian goal of attaining collective wisdom, then it might be useful in the long run."

      "text" : "Animals have evolved to embody several motivation factors. We have many instincts, and emotions; we have preset desires and fears, hunger and compassion, pride and love, shame and regret, to accomplish the myriad tasks that will prolong the human species. This species-wide fitness function is a result of red clawed and sharp toothed Darwinian evolution. However, Darwinian evolution is wasteful and unpredictable. If we simply made the first human-level AI agents permute and mutate randomly, this would drive enough force for a digital phase of Darwinian evolution. Such evolution might eventually stabilize with very advanced and excellent natured cybernetic life-forms. Or it might not.\nHowever, such Darwinian systems would have one advantage: they would not stick with one meta-goal.\nTo prevent this seeming obsession, a strategy could be to give several coherent goals to the AI, goals that would not conflict as much, but balance its behavior. For instance, we might interpret curiosity as useful, and generalize that to the ”maximize wisdom” goal, however, such elevation may be useless without another goal to preserve as much life as possible. Thus in fact, the first and so far the best meta-rule discussed was more successful because it was a hybrid strategy: it favored both life and culture. Likewise, many such goals could be defined, to increase the total computation speed, energy, information resources in the universe, however, another goal could make the AI agent distribute these in a fair way to those who agree with its policy. And needless to say, none of this might matter without a better life for every mind in the universe, and hence the AI could also favor peace, and survival of individuals, as their individual freedoms, and so forth. And perhaps another constraint would limit the resources that are used by AI’s in the universe."

      "heading" : "6 Universal Constraints and Semi-Autonomous AI",
      "text" : "The simplest way to ensure that no AI agent ever gets out of much control is to add constraints to the optimization problems that the AI is solving in the real world. For instance, since the scientist deities are quite dangerous, they might be restricted to operate in a certain space-time region, physically and precisely denoted. Such physical limits give the agent a kind of mortality which modify\nthe behavior of many universal agents [7]. AGI agents might be given a limited budget of physical resources, i.e., space/time, and energy, so that they never go out of their way to make big changes to the entire environment. If such universal constraints are given, then the AGI agent becomes only semi-autonomous, on exhaustion of resources, it may await a new command.\nA more difficult to specify kind of constraint is a non-interference clause, which may be thought of as a generalization of Asimov’s robot laws, thought to protect humans. If life and or intelligent agents may be recognized by the objective, then, the AI may be constrained to avoid any kind of physical interaction with any agent, or more specifically, any kind of physical damage to any agent, or any action that would decrease the life-span of any agent. This might be a small example of a preliminary “social instinct” for universal agents. Also, a non-interference clause is required for a general constraint, because one must assure that the rest of the universe will not be influenced by the changes in the space-time region allocated to the AI.\nA “prime directive” for an AI agent could constrain the agent from interfering with the activities of any other intelligent agent. This can be physically recognized as avoidance behavior of sorts, and it may be first approached as a tactile form of “respect”. It is possible to formalize such constraints in a physical epistemology, our agent can learn to recognize which actions would interfere with the actions of another agent, as it would seek to establish a directional probabilistic independence between itself and the causal neighborhood of the said agent. If such a prime directive were the only constraint, the agent would be quite embarrassed in company, therefore we would like to supplant any such non-interference constraint with social instincts, allowing the agent to socialize with humans.\nMarvin Minsky hypothesized in his last book The Emotion Machine that attachment learning plays a key role in the cognitive development of higher intelligence [3]. We can formalize attachment in the context of an AI agent. A particular human may be designated as the role model for the AI agent after which its behavior will be imprinted. Attachment may be modeled as liking the vicinity of the imprinter, and the learning part may be formalized by imitation learning. Attachment learning facilitates fast knowledge transfer from a parent to a child, or from a teacher to a student. A priming ability patterned after this mammalian adaptation would be immensely useful for making social agents. The emotions of pride and shame are explained as elevation of goals in Minsky’s book, which amounts to a sort of remote credit-assignment, and that particular ability would be useful for teaching ethical rules – human preferences – to robots. Another mechanism could provide a goal for participating in human society, a desire to be recognized as a member of the society may be built-in, as is likely the case in many animals. In other words, it might be possible to determine how shy or how much of a good student, or how much of an extrovert or an enthusiastic participant in society, could be determined by designing the appropriate goals and constraints. The body of work hinted at forms the basis of artificial psychology which will eventually show us mathematical forms of main\naspects of higher cognition, a few of which we reviewed. In all likelihood, a complex cognitive architecture will be required, even when based on sophisticated and scalable machine learning technology, to obtain stable, balanced, civilized behavior from semi-autonomous robots."

      "heading" : "7 Scenarios for semi-autonomous AGI agents",
      "text" : "There are many beneficial ways in which we can employ a semi-autonomous agent. For space exploration, autonomy is absolutely helpful, and I have proposed sending trans-sapient AGI equipped probes to look for life in exoplanets [8]. We could start using semi-autonomy to explore Mars and the solar system first, there are several important applications for that including prospecting of water and minerals, mining, construction, farming, repair, maintenance and so forth, which will help space colonization and deep space exploration tasks.\nEntire industries, and traditional state functions can be replaced by AGI agents. An AGI system can take care of producing enough power for people, and maintaining this function. Another could take care of obtaining clean water and irrigation. While another system could take care of producing large amounts of reliable, healthy food for millions of people. Semi-autonomy is the best model for these continuous operations that require constant monitoring and handling a lot of small details. Each ministry in a state could be managed by a semi-autonomous system, and the cybernetic loop would be observable and comprehensible to curious humans who wish to be informed of what is happening momentarily, and it would be possible to make changes as the system ran. Much like the hypothetical computers in Star Trek, these machines would be intelligent but subservient to our will, instead of the paranoid fully-autonomous intelligence in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The labor saving would be enormous and the quality of these operations would be much improved as unprecedented information integration, intelligent decision making and automation would be possible. Starting a planetary engineering project to reforest the entire world, or to cool the atmosphere, or to clean the oceans, would be feasible with such technology. These systems would also synergize happily with the ecologically minded, sustainable, efficient economic system of a desirable future.\nAn AGI system could maintain an entire habitat of people such as a city or a space station. This would likely be a great application of AI technology, as semi-autonomous agents could solve the problems of transportation, cleaning, building, surveillance, and so much more that is required in a civilized society. Such systems could help enormously with emergencies, disaster relief, fires, nuclear plant failures and other hard problems in real life that are risky for humans but would benefit from some intelligence with enough freedom of action.\nNeedless to say, human-level semi-autonomous agents can fulfill many traditional labor roles, including both intellectual and manual labor, however, most tasks would probably be automated and achieved by tools that have no autonomy, while the planning and execution of large tasks could be carried out by\nthe trans-sapient semi-autonomous AGI systems and these human-level tools or agents could be employed in groups."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text" : "We have taken a look at some obvious and some not so obvious meta-rules for autonomous AI design. We have seen that it may be too idealist to look for a singular such utility/goal. However, we have seen that, when described selflessly, we can derive several meta-rules that are compatible with a human-based technological civilization. Our main concern is that such computational deities do not negatively impact us, however, perform as much beneficial function without harming us significantly. Nevertheless, our feeling is that, any such design carries with it a gambling urge, we cannot in fact know what much greater intelligences do with meta-rules that we have designed. For when zealously carried out, any such fundamental principle can be harmful to some.\nI had wished to order these meta-rules from benevolent to malevolent. Unfortunately, during writing this essay it occurred to me that the line between them is not so clear-cut. For instance, maximizing energy might be made less harmful, if it could be controlled and used to provide the power of our technological civilization in an automated fashion, sort of like automating the ministry of energy. And likewise, we have already explained how maximizing wisdom could be harmful. Therefore, no rule that we have proposed is purely good or purely evil. From our primitive viewpoint, there are things that seem a little beneficial, but perhaps we should also consider that a much more intelligent and powerful entity may be able to find better rules on its own. Hence, we must construct a crane of morality, adapting to our present level quickly and then surpassing it. Except allowing the AI’s to evolve, we have not been able to identify a mechanism of accomplishing such. It may be that such an evolution or simulation is inherently necessary for beneficial policies to form as in Mark Waser’s Rational Universal Benevolence proposal [10], who, like me, thinks of a more democratic solution to the problem of morality (each agent should be held responsible for its actions). However, we have proposed many benevolent meta-rules, and combined with a democratic system of practical morality and perhaps top-level programming that mandates each AI to consider itself part of a society of moral agents as Waser proposes, or perhaps explicitly working out a theory of morality from scratch, and then allowing each such theory to be exercised, as long as it meets certain criteria, or by enforcing a meta-level policy of a trans-sapient state of sorts (our proposal), the development of ever more beneficial meta-rules may be encouraged.\nThe scenarios discussed show there are quite a few use cases for semi-autonomous agents that do not go out of their way to accomplish a task, but provide a high quality of service, efficiency and scalability to all civil operations that require some autonomy.\nWe think that future work must consider the dependencies between possible meta-rules, and propose actual architectures that have harmonious motivation\nand testable moral development and capability (perhaps as in Waser’s ”rational universal benevolence” definition). That is, a Turing Test for moral behavior must also be advanced. It may be argued that AGI agents that fail such tests should not be allowed to operate at all, however, merely passing the test may not be enough, as the mechanism of the system must be verified in addition."

We may still conceive of logical use cases for autonomy. We examine the alternative scenario of what happens when universal goals that are not human-centric are used for designing AI agents. We follow a design approach that tries to exclude malevolent motivations from AI agents, however, we see that objectives that seem benevolent may pose significant risk. We consider the following meta-rules: preserve and pervade life and culture, maximize the number of free minds, maximize intelligence, maximize wisdom, maximize energy production, behave like human, seek pleasure, accelerate evolution, survive, maximize control, and maximize capital. We also discuss various solution approaches for benevolent behavior including selfless goals, hybrid designs, Darwinism, universal constraints, semi-autonomy, and generalization of robot laws. A “prime directive” for AI may help in formulating an encompassing constraint for avoiding malicious behavior. We hypothesize that social instincts for autonomous robots may be effective such as attachment learning. We mention multiple beneficial scenarios for an advanced semi-autonomous AGI agent in the near future including space exploration, automation of industries, state functions, and cities.
