      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a method from multivariate statistics which seeks to find a linear projection of high-dimensional observations into a lower-dimensional space (Fisher, 1936). When its preconditions are fulfilled, LDA allows to define optimal linear decision boundaries in the resulting latent space. The aim of this paper is to exploit the beneficial properties of classic LDA (low intra class variability, hight inter-class variability, optimal decision boundaries) by reformulating its objective to learn linearly separable representations based on a deep neural network (DNN).\nRecently, methods related to LDA achieved great success in combination with deep neural networks. Andrew et al. published a deep version of Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) (Andrew et al., 2013). In their evaluations DCCA is used to produce correlated representation of multi-modal input data of simultaneously recorded acoustic and articulatory speech data. Clevert et al. propose Rectified Factor Networks (RFNs) which are a neural network interpretation of classic factor analysis (Clevert et al., 2015). RFNs are used for unsupervised pre-training and help to improve classification performance on four different benchmark datasets. Chan et al. (2015) propose PCANet as well as an LDA based variation. PCANet can be seen as a simple unsupervised convolutional deep learning approach. Their method proceeds with cascaded Principal Component Analysis (PCA), binary hashing and block histogram computation. However, one bottleneck of their approach is its limitation to very shallow architectures (two stages) (Chan et al., 2015).\nStuhlsatz et. al. already picked up the idea of combining LDA with a neural networks and proposed a generalized version of LDA (Stuhlsatz et al., 2012). Their approach starts with pre-training a stack of restricted Boltzmann machines. In a second step, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned with respect to a linear discriminant criterion. LDA has the disadvantage that it overemphasises large distances at the cost of confusing neighbouring classes. In (Stuhlsatz et al., 2012) this problem is tackled by a heuristic weighting scheme for computing the within-class scatter matrix required for LDA optimization.\n∗http://www.cp.jku.at/\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n04 70\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 N\nov 2\n01 5"

      "text" : "The approaches mentioned so far, all have in common that they are based on well established methods from multivariate statistics. Inspired by their work we propose an end-to-end deep DNN version of LDA - namely Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis (DeepLDA).\nDeep learning has become the state of the art in automatic feature learning and replaced existing approaches based on hand engineered feature in many fields such as object recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). DeepLDA is motivated by the fact that when the preconditions of LDA are met, it is capable of finding linear combinations of the input features which allow for optimal linear decision boundaries. In general LDA takes features as input. The intuition of our method is to use LDA as an objective on top of a powerful feature learning algorithm. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, we propose an LDA eigenvalue-based objective function that pushes the network to produce discriminative feature distributions. The parameters are optimized by back-propagating the error of an LDA-based objective through the entire network. We tackle the feature learning problem by focusing on directions in the latent space with smallest discriminative power. This replaces the weighting scheme of (Stuhlsatz et al., 2012) and allows to operate on the original formulation of LDA. We further expect that DeepLDA will produce linearly separable hidden representations with similar discriminative power in all directions of the latent space. Such representations should also be related with a high classification potential of the respective networks. The experimental classification results reported below will confirm that positive effect on classification accuracy, and two additional experiments (Section 5) will give us some first qualitative confirmation that the learned representations show the expected properties.\nThe reminder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide a general formulation of a DNN. Based on this formulation we introduce DeepLDA, a non-linear extension to classic LDA in Section 3. In Section 4 we experimentally evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and set a new state of the art on STL-10. Section 5 provides a deeper insight into the structure of DeepLDA’s internal represenations. In Section 6 we conclude the paper."

In the supervised setting we are additionally given a set of N train samples x1, ...xN along with corresponding classification targets t1, ...tN ∈ {1, ..., C}. We further assume that the network output pi = (pi,1, ..., pi,C) = f(xi,Θ) is normalized by the softmaxfunction to obtain class (pseudo-)probabilities.

      "text" : "Let x1, ...,xN = X ∈ RN×d denote a set of N samples belonging to C different classes c = 1, ..., C. The input representation X can either be hand engineered features, or hidden space representations H produced by a DNN (Andrew et al., 2013). LDA seeks to find a linear projection A ∈ Rl×d into a lower l-dimensional subspace L where l = C − 1. The resulting linear combinations of features xiAT are maximally separated in this space (Fisher, 1936). The LDA objective to find projection matrix A is formulated as:\narg max A |ASbAT | |ASwAT |\n(3)\nwhere Sb is the between scatter matrix and defined via the total scatter matrix St and within scatter matrix Sw as Sb = St − Sw. Sw is defined as the mean of the C individual class covariance matrices Sc (Equation (4) and (5)). X̄c = Xc −mc are the mean-centered observations of class c with per-class mean vector mc (X̄ is defined analogously for the entire population X). The total scatter matrix St is the covariance matrix over the entire population of observations X.\nSc = 1\nNc − 1 X̄Tc X̄c (4)\nSw = 1\nC ∑ c Sc (5)\nSt = 1\nN − 1 X̄T X̄ (6)\nThe linear combinations that maximize the objective in Equation (3), maximize the ratio of betweenand within-class scatter. This means in particular that a set of projected observations of the same class show low variance, where observations of different classes have high variance in the resulting space L. To find the optimum solution for Equation (3) one has to solve the general eigenvalue problem Sbe = eSwv. The projection matrix A is the set of eigenvectors e associated with this problem. In the following sections we will cast LDA as an objective function for DNN."

      "text" : "Figure 1b shows a schematic sketch of DeepLDA. Instead of sample-wise optimization of the CCE loss on the predicted class probabilities (see Section 2) we put a LDA-layer on top of the DNN. This means in particular that we do not penalize the misclassification of individual samples. Instead we try to produce features that show a low intra-class and high inter-class variability. We address this maximization problem by a modified version of the general LDA eigenvalue problem proposed in the following section. In contrast to CCE, DeepLDA optimization operates on the properties of the distribution parameters on the hidden representation produced by the neural net. As eigenvalue optimization is tied to its corresponding eigenvectors (a linear projection matrix) DeepLDA can be also interpreted as a special case of a dense layer."

      "heading" : "3.3 MODIFIED DEEPLDA OPTIMIZATION TARGET",
      "text" : "Based on Section 3.1 we reformulate the LDA objective to be suitable for a combination with deep learning. As already discussed by Stuhlsatz et al. (2012) and Lu et al. (2005) the estimation of Sw overemphasises high eigenvalues whereas small eigenvalues are estimated as too low. To weaken this effect Friedman (1989) proposed to regularize the within scatter matrix by adding a multiple of the identity matrix Sw + λI. Adding the identity matrix has the second advantage of stabilizing small eigenvalues. The resulting eigenvalue problem is then formulated as\nSbei = vi(Sw + λI)ei (7)\nwhere e = e1, ..., eC−1 are the resulting eigenvectors and v = v1, ...vC−1 the corresponding eigenvalues. Once the problem is solved each eigenvalue vi quantifies the discriminative variance in direction of the corresponding eigenvector ei. If one would like to combine this objective with a DNN the optimization target would be the maximization of the individual eigenvalues. In particular by maximizing the individual eigenvalues we should also maximize the discriminative power of the neural net. In our original experiments we started to formulate the objective as:\narg max Θ\n1\nC − 1 C−1∑ i=1 vi (8)\nOne problem we discovered with the objective in Equation (8) that the net focuses to solve trivial solutions e.g. maximize only the largest eigenvalue as this produces the highest reward. In terms of classification this means that it maximizes the distance of classes that are already separated at the expense of – potentially non-separated – neighbouring classes. This was already discussed by (Stuhlsatz et al., 2012) and tackled by a weighted computation of the between covariance matrix Sb.\nWe propose a different solution to this problem and address it by focusing our optimization on the smallest of all C − 1 available eigenvalues. In particular we consider only the k eigenvalues that do not exceed a certain threshold for variance maximization:\narg max Θ\n1\nk k∑ i=1 vi with {v1, ..., vk} = {vj |vj < min vj + } (9)\nThe intuition behind this formulation is to learn a net parametrization that pushes as much discriminative variance as possible into all of the C − 1 available feature dimensions. We would like to underline that this formulation allows to train DeepLDA networks with backpropagation in end-to-end fashion. Our models are optimized with the Nersterov momentum version of mini-batch SGD. Related methods already showed that mini-batch learning on distribution parameters (in this case covariance matrices) is feasible if the batch-size is sufficiently large to be representative for the entire population (Andrew et al., 2013)."

      "text" : "The general structure of the networks is similar for all of the three datasets and identical for CIFAR10 and STL-10. The architecture follows the VGG model with sequences of 3 × 3 convolutions (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). Instead of a dense classification layer we use global average pooling on the feature maps of the last convolution layer (Lin et al., 2013). We further apply batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) after each convolutional layer which (1) helped to increase convergence speed and (2) improved the performance of all our models. Batch normalization has a positive effect on both CCE as well as DeepLDA-based optimization. In Table 1 we outline the structure of our models in detail. All networks are trained using SGD with Nesterov momentum. The initial learning rate is set to 0.1 and the momentum is fixed at 0.9 for all our models. The learning rate is than halved every 25 epochs for CIFAR-10 and STL-10 and every 10 epochs for MNIST. For further regularization we add weight decay with a weighting of 0.0001 on all trainable parameters of the models. The between-class covariance matrix regularization weight λ (see Section 3.3) is set to 0.001 and the -offset for DeepLDA to 1.\nOne hyper-parameter that varies between the datasets is the batch size used for training DeepLDA. Although a large batch size is desired to get stable covariance estimates it is limited by the amount of memory available on the GPU. The mini-batches for DeepLDA where for MNIST: 1000, for CIFAR-10: 1000 and for STL-10: 200. For CCE training we used a batch size of 128 for all three models.

We present results for two different scenarios. In scenario MNIST-50k we train on the 50000 train samples and use the validation set to pick the parametrization which produces the best results on the validation set. In scenario MNIST-60k we train the model for the same number of epochs as in MNIST-50k but also use the validation set for training. Finally we report the accuracy of the model on the test set after the last training epoch. This approach was also applied in (Lin et al., 2013) which produce state of the art results on the dataset.\nTable 2 summarizes all results on the MNIST dataset. DeepLDA produces competitive results – having a test set error of 0.29% – although no data augmentation is used. In the approach described in (Graham, 2014) the train set is extended with translations of up to two pixels. We also observe that a linear SVM trained on the learned representation produces comparable results on the test set. It is also interesting that early stopping with best-model-selection (MNIST-50k) performs better than training on MNIST-60k even though 10000 more training examples are available."

The major difference between STL-10 and CIFAR-10 – apart from the number of train images – is the size of the contained images (see Figure 2 to get an impression of the size relations).\nTo get a deeper insight into the influence of this parameter we run the following additional experiment: (1) we create a downscaled version of the STL-10 dataset with the same image dimensions as CIFAR-10 (32× 32). (2) We repeat the experiment described in Section 4.2.3 on the downscaled 32× 32 dataset. The results are presented in Figure 3, as curves showing the evolution of train and validation accuracy during training. As expected, downscaling reduces the performance of both CCE\nand DeepLDA. We further observe that DeepLDA performs best when trained on larger images and has a disadvantage on the small images. However, a closer look at the results on CIFAR-10 (CCE: 7.10% error, DeepLDA: 7.29% error, see Table 3) suggests that this effect is compensated when the training set size is sufficiently large.

As proposed in Section 3 we encourage the net to learn feature representations with discriminative distribution parameters (within and between class scatter). We achieve this by exploiting the eigenvalue structure of the general LDA eigenvalue problem and use it as a deep learning objective. Figure 4a shows the evolution of train and test set accuracy of STL-10 along with the mean value of all eigenvalues in the respective training epoch. We observe the expected natural correlation between the magnitude of explained ”discriminative” variance and the classification potential of the resulting representation. In Figure 4b we show how the individual eigenvalues increase during training. Note that in Epoch 0 almost all eigenvalues (1-7) start at a value of 0. This emphasizes the importance of the design of our objective function (compare Equation (9)) which allows to draw discriminability into the lower dimensions of the eigen-space. In Figure 4c we additionally compare the eigenvalue structure of the latent representation produced by DeepLDA with CCE based training. Again results show that DeepLDA helps to distribute the discriminative variance more equally over the available dimensions.

The results and further investigations suggest that DeepLDA performs best, when applied to reasonable sized images (in the present case 96×96 pixel). Finally, we see DeepLDA as a specific instance of a general fruitful strategy: exploit well-understood machine learning or classification models such as LDA with certain desirable properties, and use deep networks to learn representations that provide optimal conditions for these models."

Classic LDA extracts features which preserve class separability and is used for dimensionality reduction for many classification problems. The central idea of this paper is to put LDA on top of a deep neural network. This can be seen as a non-linear extension of classic LDA. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, we propose an objective function that pushes the network to produce feature distributions which: (a) have low variance within the same class and (b) high variance between different classes. Our objective is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and still allows to train with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. For evaluation we test our approach on three different benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and STL-10). DeepLDA produces competitive results on all three datasets and sets a new state of the art on STL-10 with a test set accuracy of 81.4%.",
