However, annotating NER data by human is expensive and time-consuming, and can be quite difficult for a new language. In this paper, we present two weakly supervised approaches for cross-lingual NER with no human annotation in a target language. The first approach is to create automatically labeled NER data for a target language via annotation projection on comparable corpora, where we develop a heuristic scheme that effectively selects good-quality projection-labeled data from noisy data. The second approach is to project distributed representations of words (word embeddings) from a target language to a source language, so that the source-language NER system can be applied to the target language without re-training. We also design two co-decoding schemes that effectively combine the outputs of the two projection-based approaches. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches on both in-house and open NER data for several target languages. The results show that the combined systems outperform three other weakly supervised approaches on the CoNLL data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Jul 2017 19:45:47 GMT  (574kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02483v1", "11 pages, The 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, The 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jian ni", "georgiana dinu", "radu florian"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.02483"}
