The approach follows state-of-the-art work on online density estimation, but was redesigned with computational efficiency, numerical robustness, and extensibility in mind. Our approach produces comparable or better results than the current state-of-the-art, while achieving significant computational performance gains and improved numerical stability. The use of diagonal covariance Gaussian kernels, which further improve performance and stability, at a small loss of modelling quality, is also explored. Our approach is up to 40 times faster, while requiring 90% less memory than the closest state-of-the-art counterpart.\nc© 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

      "text" : "Online learning is needed when data is not known a priori, its distribution evolves, or when the data model must be updated without interrupting operation: the model must evolve as new data appears, allowing older data to become progressively less important. Our goal is to produce a fast, robust way of handling long-running modelling tasks. Since capturing, processing, and saving all past observed samples is computationally unfeasible, similar samples can be grouped and represented by more compact entities, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).\nKernel density estimation (KDE) methods are nonparametric approaches to build GMMs that do not require prior definition of the number of components. In order to manage complexity, some approaches compress the model to a predefined number of components [7], or optimize some data-driven choice [3]. A different approach [20] is to view model compression as a clustering\n∗Corresponding author e-mail: david.matos@inesc-id.pt (David Martins de Matos)\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n02 60\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nJ un\n2 01\n6\n2 problem. The main difficulty of adapting KDE methods to online operation lies in maintaining sufficient information to generalize to unobserved data and to adjust model complexity without access to all past samples. An online approach based on mean-shift mode finding adds each new sample to the model as a Gaussian component. However, it is sensitive to non-Gaussian areas due to skewed or heavy tailed data [9]. A two-level approach [4], based on the idea that each component of the (non-overfitting) mixture is in turn represented by an underlying mixture that represents data very precisely (possibly overfitting), allows the model to be refined without sacrificing accuracy, as a merge in the upper level can later be accurately split. It is also able handle the problem of non-Gaussian data by using a uniform distribution in those regions.\nThe online kernel density estimation (oKDE) approach [13, 14] builds a two-level model of the target distribution. It maintains a sample distribution that is used to compute the corresponding KDE. It supports single-sample updates and has a forgetting factor. This allows model adaptation when the target distribution evolves. Compressions approximate component clusters using single Gaussians. If the target distribution changes sufficiently, compressions can be reversed, using the underlying model kept by each component.\nOur approach follows oKDE, obtaining comparable or better results. It allows for flexibility, abstraction, efficient memory use, computational efficiency, and numerical robustness. Furthermore, our C++ implementation, based on state-of-the-art libraries [8], allows easy exploration of modelling alternatives.\nThe article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes oKDE. Section 3 describes our adaptations for numerical stability. Section 4 describes our approach to high dimensionality. Section 5 presents specific computational strategies to improve performance. Section 6 describes the evaluation setup and Section 7 presents our results. Section 8 concludes the article."

Let wiφΣi(x−µi) be one of the new components. If the determinant of Σi is zero, then the component is a single data-point and its detailed model is just the component itself. Otherwise, the component has been generated through clustering in previous compression steps: its detailed model is initialized by splitting φΣi(x−µi) along its principal axis [10] into a two-component mixture, whose first two moments match those of the original component. This has two advantages: first, since the component is symmetric around the mean, the splitting process minimizes the induced error; and second, it is moment preserving, i.e., the mean and covariance of the split Gaussian (and, thus, of the entire mixture), remains unchanged."

A way to efficiently compute the inverse of a non-singular matrix is to first compute its LU decomposition and use it to compute the inverse. Since we guarantee that Σ is positive definite, the determinant can be computed by multiplying the diagonal entries of U. However, when working in high dimensionality, overflows or underflows are bound to occur, even when using double precision floating point. To avoid this problem, we compute the logarithm of the determinant instead: this is simply the sum of the logarithm of each entry in the diagonal of matrix U. 3.3. Whitening Transformation\nA single Hopt means that all components are scaled equally in all dimensions. If the spread of data is much greater in one dimension than in others, extreme differences of spread in the various dimensions may occur. This can be avoided by first whitening the data, by transforming it to have unit covariance, smoothing it using a radially symmetric kernel, and, finally, transforming it back [6]. Whitening allows Hopt to better fit the global distribution of the data, leading to better models [24].\nIn our approach, both the computation of Hopt and model compression are performed on whitened data. Whitening starts by approximating the whole model by a single Gaussian. The parameters needed to transform the model covariance into the identity matrix are then computed and individually applied to all components in the mixture. The inverse operation can be used to recover the model.\nFormally, the whitening transformation of data x with covariance Σ is defined as w=Λ−1/2ΦTx, where Λ and Φ are the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors from the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix Σ.\nWhitening impacts the model in two ways. The first is computational performance: since the structure F is equal to I , it significantly saves computational costs in matrix multiplications (eq. 5). The second is model quality, as both the computation of Hopt and the compression phase, performed using Goldberger’s K-means, benefit from working on spherized data.\n8"

Recall that we assume that the structureF of Hopt is well-approximated\nby the covariance of the entire model and that finding Hopt amounts to finding βopt (section 2.2). If this scaling factor is zero, e.g. caused by precision issues or by data distribution in the model, Hopt will be zero. This means that no smoothing will be applied to the KDE. In this case, Dirac-deltas will remain with zero covariance, not allowing the use of the standard likelihood function. Since Hopt is computed on whitened data, one solution for this problem is to detect these occurrences and set the bandwidth as the identity matrix, and then computing the backwards whitening transformation."

This is in contrast with quadratic growth for full covariances. Furthermore, for non-normalized data, diagonal covariances may improve stability, as certain relationships that could result in singular covariances are ignored. Our numerical stability strategies have a stronger impact with diagonal covariances: for data with flat or near-flat dimensions this is particularly relevant (section 7)."

In other cases, computation of Hopt may be postponed. This means that the cost of adding a sample is simply that of adding one Dirac-delta component to the mixture and updating the current weights. This can be done without impact on model quality.\nThe determinant and the inverse of covariance matrices are needed to compute the likelihood function (which is called very often). Thus, it makes sense to save them, once they have been computed, and keep them until the covariance changes. Then,\n9 previous values are marked as invalid, but are not recomputed immediately. As with Hopt, it is advantageous to postpone these computations until they are actually needed, making the process of adding components to the mixture faster."

For intrinsic evaluation, we assess model quality by using the average negative log-likelihood and model complexity. For extrinsic evaluation, we assess the accuracy of a classification task. For the latter, we also compare our results with a discriminative approach, since it is typically better suited for classification tasks. We used the online independent support vector machine (OISVM) [18, 19].\nThe datasets (Table 1 and Fig. 1) and evaluation setup from the original oKDE paper were used. Since some of the datasets have been updated, we ran both approaches on the most recent versions. We also evaluated our approach on the L2F Face Database, a high dimensional scenario (section 6.1). For the online classification task, we randomly shuffled the data in each dataset and used 75% of the data to train and the rest to test. For each dataset, to minimize impact of lucky/unlucky partitions, we generated 12 random shuffles.

L2F Face Database\nThe L2F Face Database consists of 30,000 indoor free pose face images from 10 subjects (3,000 images per subject). Capture was performed using a PlayStation Eye camera (640x480 pixel). A Haar cascade [25, 1] detected frontal face poses, but also some high inclination and head rotation poses. The square face regions were cropped and resized to 64x64 pixels. During capture, each subject was asked to behave normally and avoid being static, to avoid restrictions on facial pose or expression. Since faces tend to be centered in the cropped square, a fixed mask, roughly selecting parts of eyes, nose, and cheeks, was applied to the crops, producing 128-pixel vectors.\n11"

We intentionally used the datasets with no further processing to study a more realistic online operation scenario, where the sample distribution is not known. These results demonstrate the numerical robustness of xokde++ in handling non-normalized datasets. OISVM typically outperforms the generative approaches, but only slightly. However, it shares some of the oKDE numerical instabilities.\nThe high dimensionality scenario was tested using the L2F Face Database. oKDE, OISVM, and xokde++ (with full covariances), were unable to build models for this dataset. xokde++ (with diagonal covariances) obtained an accuracy of 94.1%, very close to the accuracy of 95.4% obtained by a batch SVM. 7.3. Time and Memory Performance\nxokde++ produces models with similar or better quality than oKDE. Moreover, it does so at lower computational cost. Tables 5 and 6 show the time and memory needed to train and test each dataset: xokde++ achieves speedups from 3 to 10; with diagonal covariances, speedups range from 11 to 40. Regarding memory, xokde++ uses at most 10% of the memory required by oKDE. This difference is more critical in large datasets such as the “skin” and “covtype”. For these datasets, oKDE needed 913MB and 5064MB, while xokde++ needed only 83MB and 361MB, respectively.\nRegarding memory, OISVM performs poorly when compared with the other approaches.

For large datasets, time performance also degrades: the “skin” dataset took nearly twice the time it took for oKDE. This is even clearer for the “covtype” dataset, which has 500,000 samples: 7 days of computation were not enough to complete training a single shuffle, showing that it was unfeasible to complete the 12 shuffles of our evaluation setup in an acceptable time frame. 7.4. Performance of Full vs. Diagonal Covariances\nTable 7 presents a detailed comparison of the two xokde++ variants, regarding model quality and computational needs. Using diagonal covariances produces models with slightly higher complexity at a small loss in model quality, while needing less memory and greatly improving computational time performance. For the “steel” dataset, diagonal covariances also allowed the model to cope with feature dimensions with low variance, thus avoiding the severe numerical instability found when using full covariances, where the lack of feature variance frequently produced singular matrices.\nFor full covariances, the number of variables increases quadratically with the number of dimensions and datasets with higher dimensionality will benefit from using diagonal covariances. Even though the diagonal approach tends to need more components, partially offsetting memory savings, the average memory usage of the diagonal approach is just 78.5% of the needed for full\n14\nxokde++ xokde++/d oKDE OISVM\nDataset MB ρ% MB ρ% MB MB ρ% Iris 4.6 3.8 4.5 3.7 123.0 116.6 94.8 Yeast 6.8 3.9 5.8 3.4 173.1 148.9 86.0 Pima 6.2 3.9 5.2 3.3 157.5 124.8 79.3 Red 8.1 5.6 6.2 4.2 145.4 162.2 111.5 White 10.3 5.1 8.3 4.1 204.3 228.4 111.8 Wine 6.3 4.4 4.8 3.3 144.3 120.2 83.3 Letter 42.6 9.8 23.2 5.4 433.3 1823.9 420.9 Seg 15.7 7.7 7.7 3.8 203.9 192.3 94.3 Steel — — 7.2 4.0 — — — Cancer 10.6 5.5 6.6 3.4 193.1 141.8 73.4 Skin 83.1 9.1 83.2 9.1 913.3 2255.1 246.9 Covtype 361.2 7.1 360.4 7.1 5064.8 — —\nTable 5: Results for memory performance (MB). ρ is the relative usage against the oKDE baseline.\ncovariances.

Model quality comparable to that of oKDE, while needing significantly less memory and computation time. The numerical stability improvements allow xokde++ to cope with non-normalized data and achieve an average classifier accuracy of 78% (against oKDE’s 73%). This is a 6.5% average improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it continues to achieve good results where other approaches fail to even convege (section 7.2). From a software standpoint, xokde++ is extensible, due to its pure template library nature, as shown by the use of diagonal covariances, which were easily implemented and provide aditional time and memory efficiency while sacrificing little model quality.\nBesides speed and memory efficiency, one central contribution of our approach is its adaptability and extensibility. Since it was implemented in an OOP language (C++), the templated classes allow for easy extension, as shown by switching between full and\n15\nxokde++ xokde++/d oKDE OISVM\nDataset time σ ρ time σ ρ time σ time σ ρ Iris 0.5 0.1 11.0 0.1 0.0 34.2 5.0 0.7 0.2 0.1 26.7 Yeast 39.4 3.2 4.5 6.5 0.7 27.1 177.2 8.1 7.7 0.3 23.1 Pima 16.9 2.1 7.9 3.3 0.3 40.1 133.9 2.3 1.5 0.4 90.1 Red 61.0 7.7 5.4 14.4 0.7 22.6 326.4 27.5 10.6 1.8 30.7 White 130.7 4.0 5.8 39.0 1.7 19.6 764.1 51.3 37.2 3.6 20.5 Wine 3.0 0.5 3.2 0.5 0.1 21.4 9.7 0.6 0.3 0.1 29.4 Letter 2119.0 66.7 3.0 191.7 3.5 33.7 6452.9 191.9 5225.4 1341.0 1.2 Seg 296.8 26.1 1.7 45.0 6.1 11.5 515.7 21.5 84.1 12.0 6.1 Steel — — — 8.7 0.5 — — — — — — Cancer 52.6 6.9 2.6 11.7 1.1 11.6 135.6 11.2 0.6 0.1 221.8 Skin 572.9 204.5 11.5 192.2 40.9 34.2 6565.1 1471.0 10522.5 2144.0 0.6 Covtype 9803.8 1614.9 2.6 1156.6 124.5 22.2 25713.3 2081.3 — — —\nTable 6: Results for time performance (seconds) (σ = one standard deviation). ρ is the speedup over the oKDE baseline.\ndiagonal covariances. Other parts of the code are also easily extended, e.g., using triangular covariances, or replacing the Gaussian pdf with a different one. Similarly, changing the compression phase is also a simple process.\nFuture work to improve computational performance includes high-performance computing adaptations. Other improvements include changing the hierarchical compression approach, to another, more paralelizable approach such as pairwise merging of components [23]. Moreover, model quality can also be improved. Instead of using full or diagonal covariances, which are either too large for high dimensionality or too restrictive for certain non-linearly independent data, covariances could be approximated with low-rank perturbations [16], or using Toeplitz matrices [21, 2]. Finally, improvements on numerical stability and model quality may be obtained by avoiding correction of degenerate covariances and, instead, compute pseudo-inverses and pseudo-logdeterminants [17]."

Our approach produces comparable or better results than the current state-of-the-art, while achieving significant computational performance gains and improved numerical stability. The use of diagonal covariance Gaussian kernels, which further improve performance and stability, at a small loss of modelling quality, is also explored.
