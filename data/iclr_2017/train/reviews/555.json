{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Exploring the Application of Deep Learning for Supervised Learning Problems", "abstract": "One of the main difficulties in applying deep neural nets (DNNs) to new domains is the need to explore multiple architectures in order to discover ones that perform well. We analyze a large set of DNNs across multiple domains and derive insights regarding their effectiveness. We also analyze the characteristics of various DNNs and the general effect they may have on performance. Finally, we explore the application of meta-learning to the problem of architecture ranking. We demonstrate that by using topological features and modeling the changes in its weights, biases and activation functions layers of the initial training steps, we are able to rank architectures based on their predicted performance. We consider this work to be a first step in the important and challenging direction of exploring the space of different neural network architectures.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper presents an intriguing study of how one can pose architecture search as a meta learning problem.

It reported a series of experiments on various small tasks and feed-forward DNNs. It claims that some ranking algorithm can be learned based on these results to guide the selection of model structures for new domains.\n\nAlthough the goal is interesting I found their conclusion is neither convincing nor useful in practice for several reasons:\n\n1. They only explored really simple networks (feed-forward DNNs). While this significantly limited the search space, it also limited the value of the experiments. In fact, the best model architecture is highly task (domain) dependent and the type of model (DNN vs CNN vs LSTM) is often much more important than size of the network itself.\n2. Their experiments were conduced with some important hyper parameters (e.g., learning rate schedule) fixed. However, it is well known  that learning rate often is the most important hyper parameter during training. Without adjusting these important hyper parameters the conclusion on the best model architecture is not convincing.\n3. Their experiments seem to indicate that the training data difference is not important. However, this is unlikely to be true as you would definitely want to use larger models (total number of parameters) when your training set is magnitude larger (i.e., log(datasize) can be an important feature). This is likely because they did not run experiments on large datasets.\n\nIn addition, I think the title of the paper does not accurately reflect what the paper is about and should be modified. Also, this paper cited Sainath et al. 2015 as the work that leads to breakthrough in speech recognition. However, the breakthrough in ASR happened much earlier.
