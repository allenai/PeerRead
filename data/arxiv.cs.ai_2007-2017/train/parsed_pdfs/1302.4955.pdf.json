      "text" : "This is a working paper summarizing results of an ongoing research project whose aim is to uniquely characterize the uncertainty mea sure for the Dempster-Shafer Theory. A set of intuitive axiomatic requirements is pre sented, some of their implications are shown, and the proof is given of the minimality of re cently proposed measure AU among all mea sures satisfying the proposed requirements.\n1 Introduction.\nSoon after the emergence of the Dempster-Shafer The ory (DST), researchers began their quest for a suit able measure of uncertainty (or information) for DST, which could be used in a similar manner as the Shan non entropy has been used within probability theory. However, the task is far from easy and has not been solved satisfactorily as yet. The common pitfall of the various proposed measures is the lack of property of subadditivity that is considered essential. (For more detailed discussion of the history of the search for un certainty measure for DST see [7).)\nIn a recent paper [5), Harmanec and Klir proposed a new measure of uncertainty for DST. This measure is the only measure, among those introduced in the literature that satisfies all basic properties (including subadditivity) one would expect from such a measure. Independently, the measure was also proposed in [2] and [8), but with a somewhat different motivation.\nConsidering the fact that this measure is the only known measure of (total ) uncertainty for DST that is additive, subadditive and in corresponding cases col lapses into the Shannon and Hartley entropies, it is natural to ask whether these properties, possibly with some other intuitive properties, are sufficient to char acterize this measure. An investigation of this problem\nis the topic of this paper. Unfortunately, I do not have a complete solution as yet, but I present some partial results. Namely, a set of eight plausible axiomatic re quirements for a meaningful measure of uncertainty is suggested, some consequences of these requirements are shown, and the proof that the proposed measure is the smallest among all measures satisfying these ax ioms is given.\n2 Notation and Basic Definitions.\nLet X denote some given finite (non-empty) universal set, usually called a frame of discernment in the con text of DST. It is assumed that elements of X repre sent all possible and mutually exclusive states of some system (answers to a question etc.). Let 'P (X) denote the power set of X.\nA belief function is a function Bel : 'P (X) --+ [0, 1) such that Bel (0) = 0, Bel (X) = 1, and\nBel (A1 U · · · U AN) � L { (-1)III+l Bel (niEIA) 10 # I� {1, ... ,N}}\nfor all possible families of subsets of X. A belief func tion models a belief state of a Believer; Bel( A) is the degree of belief of the Believer, on the basis of avail able evidence, that the actual state ( the true answer, etc.) is in A.\nA basic probability assignment is a function m : 'P (X) --+ [0, 1) such that m (0) = 0 and\nL m (A) = 1. AEP(X)\nA basic probability assignment is again considered as an evidence function; m(A) is interpreted as a degree to which the Believer considers available evidence to support exactly A and not any of its proper subsets. Any subset A of X, for which m(A) > 0 is called a focal element of m.\n256 Harmanec\nAB is well known [11), given a belief function, Bel, the function m defined by the equation\nm (A)= L (-1)1A-BIBel(B) B�A\nfor all A E P(X) is a basic probability assignment (called the basic probability assignment associated with Bel). Similarly, given a basic probability assign ment m the function Bel defined by\nBel(A) = L m(B) B�A\nfor all A E P(X) is a belief function (called the be lief function associated with m). Using this corre spondence we can freely switch arguments �bout belief functions and basic probability assignments without worrying about inconsistency or misunderstanding.\nLet Y = {E1,_Eh, . • . ,EN} denote a partition of X, i.e., Ei n Ej = 0 fori=/: j and uf:_1 Ei = X . Then, for each A � X, the set A ! Y defined by\nA ! Y = { Ei E Y 1 Ei n A =/: 0}\nis called projection of A on Y. For a basic probability assignment m on X, we define the projection of m on Y by the formula\nm! Y(C) = m(B) B�XIBlY=C\nfor all C E 'P(Y). The reader can verify that m ! Y is really a basic probability assignment on Y; moreover,\nBel! Y (C) = Bel(UC),\nfor all C E 'P(Y), is the corresponding belief function.\n3 Axioms for Measure of Uncertainty\nIn this section, I discuss the properties a measure of uncertainty for DST should possess. I formulate the requirements in terms of basic probability assignments since it is simpler from a technical point of view, but belief functions or plausibility functions (see [11) for definition) could be used for this purpose as well.\n(RO) Functionality. The sought uncertainty mea sure should be a mapping U that assigns a real number to each basic probability assignment m on every finite frame of discernment X. For the purpose of this pa per, I consider m to be a 6et of ordered pairs (A, m(A)), where A E P(X) and m(A) is a basic probability num ber corresponding to A. Sometimes, I list only those pairs that correspond to the focal elements of m, and omit pairs with zero basic probability number. For mally,\nU: m�--+U(m),\nfor all m = {(A, m(A)) I A E P(X), m(0) = 0, LAEP(X) m(A) = 1} and all finite X's, where U(m) E R.\n(Rl) Label Independency. The measure of uncer tainty should not depend on the names of system's states (answers etc.) . For example,\nm1 = { (0, 0) , ( {a} , 0.2) , ( { b} , 0.5) , ( {a, b} , 0 .3)}\nand\nm2 = { (0, 0) , ( {!::.} , 0.5) , ( { *} , 0.2) , ( { 6., *} , 0 .3)}\nought to have the same amount of uncertainty. For mally, let X, Y be two finite sets such that lX I = IYI and let 1r : X ----+ Y be a one to one mapping of X onto Y. Extend 1r in the usual way onto power sets: 1r(A) = { 1r (x) lx E A} for all A E P (X). Moreover, let m be a basic probability assignment on X. Define a basic probability assignment 1r (m) on Y by\nfor all BE 'P (Y), where ?r-1 denotes the inverse map ping for ?r. Then it is required that"

      "text" : "(R2) Continuity. Another property U should pos sess is continuity. This means, roughly, that a small change in basic probability assignment m should not change abruptly the amount of uncertainty carried by m.

This requirement states that adding an element to the frame of discernment with out a change in Believer's beliefs (basic probability as signment) should not affect the amount of uncertainty contained in the beliefs. Formally,\nUN+t(mi. ... ,mN,O,mt2, ... ,m1N,O, ffl23, ... ,m12 ... N,0, ... ,0) = UN(mt, ... ,mN,m12, ... ,m1N,m2a, ... ,m12 ... N)\nfor any basic probability assignment m on {1, 2, ... , N}, where zeros in the left hand side of the equation are on the places corresponding to the subsets of {1, 2, ... , N + 1} containing N + 1.\n(R4) Subadditivity. Assume that the system de scribed by the set of states X can be divided into two subsystems with their respective sets of states being Yt and Y2. Then by projecting our beliefs (basic prob ability assignment) onto Yt and }2 we preserve our knowledge (or information, if you wish) about subsys tems, but we loose our knowledge about the interaction between the subsystems. Therefore, uncertainty con tained in our knowledge of the whole system should not decrease by projecting it on subsystems.\nFormally: Let Y1 = {A1,A2, ... , Ap} and Y2 = { B1, B2, .. . , BQ} be two distinct partitions of X, such that IAi n Bj I = 1 for all i E {1, 2, ... , P} and all j E {1,2, ... ,Q}. Then for an arbitrary basic proba bility assignment m on X\n(R5) Additivity. This requirement supplements the previous one. In the setting of the previous require ment, the overall uncertainty should be the same after the projections onto the subsystems if there is no in teraction between subsystems.\nAgain, let Yt {At. A2, .. . , Ap } and Y2 = { B1, B2, ... , BQ} be two (different) partitions of X, such that IAi n Bj I = 1 for all i E {1, 2, ... , P} and all j E {1, 2, ... , Q}. Moreover, let m be a basic probabil ity assignment on X such that for every focal element Aofm,\nA = {y1 ny2ly1 E A L Yt,Y2 E A L Y2}\nand m (A) = m L Yt (A L Yt) .m L (A L Y2). Then,\nU (m) = U (m L Yt) +U (m L Y2).\n(R6) Monotone Dispensability. According to this requirement, the uncertainty should not decrease af ter transferring part of basic probability mass from a focal element A onto one of its supersets. In terms of belief functions, if we decrease our belief in a subset A of X without otherwise changing our beliefs (except those implied by our original belief in A) we should not decrease our uncertainty.\nFormally, let m be a basic probability assignment on X and A an arbitrary focal element of m.

The proof is a direct generalization of the cor responding proof in the characterization of the Shan non entropy [4]. It is enough to show that\nfor all N � 2 and all (2N - 1)-tuples (m�,m2, ... ,mN,m12, ... ,m12 ... N) such that m1 � 0, 0 -:/= I £:;; {1, 2, ... , N} and 2::iil#<;;;{l,2, ... ,N} m1 = 1.\n258 Harmanec\nBy a repeated use of the expansibility requirement (R3), we have\nUN (mt. m2, ... , mN, m12, ... , m12 ... N) = UN+1(m1, m2, ... ,mN,O, m12, ... , m1N,o, ... ,m12 ... N,o, . . . , 0) =\n=UN2(m1,m2, ... ,mN,O, . . . , 0, m12, ... ,m1N,o, ... ,0, . . ,m12 ... N,o, ... , 0),\n(1}\nand by subadditivity (R4) and symmetry (R1), we get\nUN2(m1,m2, ... ,mN,O, ... ,0, m12, ... ,m1N,o, ... , 0, ... ,m12 ... N,o, . . . , 0) :S\nUN (m1,m2, ... ,mN,m12, ... ,m12 ... N) + (2)\nUN (mt, m2, ... , mN, m12, ... , m12 ... N). (To better see this step, one can imagine instead of {1,2, ... ,N2} the Cartesian product {1,2, . . . ,N} X {1, 2, . . . , N}; the (potentially) non-zero elements m1, ... , m12 ... N then correspond to the \"diagonal\" elements of the Cartesian product, as illustrated in Figure 1.) From ( 1) and (2), we may conclude\n•\nNext I show that U collapses to the Shannon entropy and to the Hartley entropy in relevant situations.\nTheorem 2 Assume that N � 2, mi � 0 for i E { 1,2, ... ,N} and Ef:1 mi = 1. Then, for any map ping U satisfying requirements {R1}-(R5}, and (R7} specified in Section 9, it holds that\nN UN (mt,m2, ... ,rnN,O, . . . , 0) =- L mi log2mi.\ni=l\nProof. Forte [4] showed that the only function K.N defined on N-tuples (p1,p2, . .. ,PN) such that Pi � 0, i E {1, 2, . .. , N} and 2::!1 Pi = 1, which is symmetric, expansible, additive, subadditive, satisfying the nor malization K-2 (!, ! ) = 1 and the condition\nlim K-2 (p, 1-p) = K-2 (0, 1) , (3) p--+0+\nis the Shannon entropy. Since our requirements of symmetry, expansibility, additivity, subadditivity and probabilistic normalization corresponds under the as sumptions of the theorem exactly to the respective Forte's axioms, and since the continuity requirement implies the condition (3} , the theorem follows. •\nTheorem 3 For any mapping U satisfying require ments (R1}, {R3}, {R5}, (R6}, and {RB}\nu ((A, 1)) = log2 IA I ,\nfor arbitrary finite frame of discernment X and arbi trary A� X.\nProof. Renyi [10] showed that the only function I defined on natural numbers (� 1), which satisfies (a} I ( N.M) = I ( N} +I ( M), for all N, M E N, (b) I (N) :S I (N + 1), for all N EN, (c) I(2) = 1, is the Hartley entropy. However, from the label independency and the expansibility we know that U ((A, 1)) depends only on the cardinality of A, so we are looking for a function f defined on natural num bers (� 1), such that\nU ((A, 1)) = f(IA I).\nFrom additivity we know that f satisfies (a), from monotone dispensability it has to obey (b), and non specificity normalization guarantees (c). Therefore the theorem follows from Renyi's result. •\nCorollary 4 For any mapping U satisfying require ments {R1}, (R:J}, {R5}, {R6}, and (RB}, and any ba sic probability assignment m on a finite frame of dis cernment X,\nu (m) ::::; log2IXI .\nProof. It is enough to consider X= {1, 2, . . . , N}. By repeated use of monotone dispensability, we get\nUN (m) :S UN (0, m2, m3, ... , mN, m12, ... , m12 ... N + m1) :S\n:SUN (0, 0, .. . , 1).\nThen, by Theorem 3,\nUN (0,0, .. . , 1) = log2 N. •\nToward a Characterization of Uncertainty Measure for the Dempster-Shafer T heory 259\n5 Minimality of the Uncertainty Measure AU\nBefore proving that the proposed measure AU is min imal, let me show that AU satisfies the requirements (RO) - (R8) and, therefore, at least one uncertainty measure satisfies all these requirements.\nDefinition 1 [5] Let X denote a (finite) frame of dis cernment and Bel a belief function defined on X. We define the measure of uncertainty contained in Bel, denoted as AU (Bel), by\nAU (Bel)= max {- L Px log2Pz} , zEX\nwhere the maximum is taken over all {Px} zEX such that Pz E [0, 1] for all x EX, L:xEX Px = 1, and for all A� X, Bel (A)� l:xEAPx·\nNote that the maximum always exists since we are maximizing a continuous function on a simplex1. To be able to take an advantage of the basic probability assignment, we need the following theorem.\nTheorem 5 (Dempster [3]) Let X be a frame of dis cernment, Bel a belief function on X and m the cor responding basic probability assignment; then a tuple <:Pz) xEX satisfies the following constmints\n0 � Px � 1 for all x EX, :Ex EX Px = 1' and\nBel( A) � l::eEA pz, for all A� X,\nif and only if there exist non-negative real numbers aA for all 0 # A � X and all x E A such that\nand L aA=m(A).\nzlzEA\nTheorem 6 Under the conditions of Definition 1, the measure AU satisfies all the requirements (RO)- (RB).\nProof. Requirements (R1) - (R3) follow directly from the definition of AU. In our previous paper [5], we showed that AU satisfies requirements (R4) and (R5). In the same paper we have also shown that AU collapses to the Shannon entropy and the Hartley entropy in the corresponding cases. This fact implies requirements (R7) and (R8). It only remains to show that AU obeys the requirement (R6).\n1 We assume 0 log2 0 = 0.\nLet X, A, B, a, m, and m' have the same mean ing as in the assumptions of the requirement (R6) . Let (pz)zEX be such a tuple that Pz 2: 0, for X E X, L::eEX Px = 1, for all C � X L:xECPz 2: Bel (C), where Bel denotes the belief function cor responding to the basic probability assignment m, and - L:xEX Px log2Pz = AU (m). Then by Theo rem 5, there exist non-negative real numbers {3(; for all 0 of:.

I do not know the answer to this ques tion as yet, but I can show that AU is the smallest measure satisfying all the requirements.\nTheorem 7 Let X denote a (finite) frame of dis cernment and m a basic probability assignment on X. Then for any mapping U satisfying all the requirements {RO} - {RB), we have\nAU (m) $U (m).\nProof. Let Bel denote the belief function on X corresponding tom. Consider arbitrary (px) xEX, Px E [0, 1], LxEX Px = 1, such that\nBel (A) $ L Px, xEA\nfor all A � X. By Theorem 2\nAU ({ ({x},px) I x EX})= - LxEX Px log2Px = (4)\nU ( { ( {X}, Px) I X E X}) .\nFrom Theorem 5, we know that there are non-negative real numbers aA. for all 0 # A � X and all x E A such that\n- \"\"' X Px- L....J aA, AlxEA\nfor all x EX, and\nL aA. =m(A), xlxEA\nfor all 0 #A � X.

I proved some conse quences of these requirements and showed that the recently proposed measure AU [5] satisfies all the re quired axioms. The question, whether AU is the only measure satisfying these requirements or not remains an open problem. Depending on the solution of this problem, we can look at Theorem 7 from two different angles. It can be either considered as a step toward uniqueness proof or it can be considered as a justifica tion for choosing AU as the measure of uncertainty for DST. It seems reasonable to take the \"smallest\" mea sure, since we do not want to attach to a belief function more uncertainty than necessary. Though this require ment is probably less appealing than the requirements (RO) - (R8), it looks like a good practical guidance in the choice of the uncertainty measure for DST.\nAcknowledgment\nI am grateful to Professor G.
