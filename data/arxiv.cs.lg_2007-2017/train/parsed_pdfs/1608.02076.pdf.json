      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Recently, several neural network models have been developed for efficiently accessing long-term memory and discovering dependencies in sequential data. The memory network framework has been studied in the context of question answering and language modeling (Weston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), whereas the neural attention model under the encoder-decoder framework has been applied to machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and constituency parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015b). Both frameworks learn the latent alignment between the source and target sequences, and the mechanism of\n1Our software and models are available at https:// github.com/hao-cheng/biattdp.\nattention over the encoder can be viewed as a soft operation on the memory. Although already used in the encoder for capturing global context information (Bahdanau et al., 2015), the bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) has yet to be employed in the decoder. Bi-directional decoding is expected to be advantageous over the previously developed uni-directional counterpart, because the former exploits richer contextual information. Intuitively, we can use two separate uni-directional RNNs where each one constructs its respective attended encoder context vectors for computing RNN hidden states. However, the drawback of this approach is that the decoder would often produce different alignments resulting in discrepancies for the forward and backward directions. In this paper, we design a training objective function to enforce attention agreement between both directions, inspired by the alignmentby-agreement idea from Liang et al. (2006). Specifically, we develop a dependency parser (BiAtt-DP) using a bi-directional attention model based on the memory network. Given that the golden alignment is observed for dependency parsing in the training stage, we further derive a simple and interpretable approximation for the agreement objective, which makes a natural connection between the latent and observed alignment cases.\nThe proposed BiAtt-DP parses a sentence in a linear order via sequentially querying the memory component that stores continuous embeddings for all headwords. In other words, we consider all possible arcs during the parsing. This formulation is adopted by graph-based parsers such as the MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005). The consideration\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n02 07\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n2 Se\np 20\nof all possible arcs makes the proposed BiAtt-DP different from many recently developed neural dependency parsers (Chen and Manning, 2014; Weiss et al., 2015; Alberti et al., 2015; Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015), which use a transitionbased algorithm by modeling the parsing procedure as a sequence of actions on buffers. Moreover, unlike most graph-based parsers which may suffer from high computational complexity when utilizing high-order parsing history (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), the proposed BiAtt-DP can implicitly inject such information into the model while keeping the computational complexity in the order of O(n2) for a sentence with n words. This is achieved by feeding the RNN in the query component with a soft headword embedding, which is computed as the probability-weighted sum of all headword embeddings in the memory component.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply memory network models to graphbased dependency parsing. Moreover, it is the first extension of neural attention models from unidirection to multi-direction by enforcing agreement on alignments. Experiments on English, Chinese, and 12 languages from the CoNLL 2006 shared task show the BiAtt-DP can achieve competitive parsing accuracy with several state-of-the-art parsers. Furthermore, our model achieves the highest unlabeled attachment score (UAS) on Chinese, Czech, Dutch, German, Spanish and Turkish."

      "heading" : "2.1 Token Embeddings",
      "text" : "In the proposed BiAtt-DP, the memory and query components share the same token embeddings. We use the notion of additive token embedding as in (Botha and Blunsom, 2014) to utilize the available information about the token, e.g., its word form, lemma, part-of-speech (POS) tag, and morphological features. Specifically, the token embedding is computed as\nEformeformi + E poseposi + E lemmaelemmai + · · · ,\nwhere ei’s are one-hot encoding vectors for the ith word, and E’s are parameters to be learned that store the continuous embeddings for corresponding feature. Note those one-hot encoding vectors have different dimensions, depending on individual vocabulary sizes, and all E’s have the same first dimension but different second dimension. The additive token embeddings allow us to easily integrate a variety of information. Moreover, we only need to make a single decision on the dimensionality of the token embedding, rather than a combination of decisions on word embeddings and POS tag embeddings as in concatenated token embeddings used by Chen and Manning (2014), Dyer et al. (2015) and Weiss et al. (2015). It reduces the number of model parameters to be tuned, especially when lots of different features are used. In our experiments, the word form and fine-grained POS tag are always used, whereas other features are used depending on their availability in the dataset. All singleton words, lemmas, and POS tags are replaced by special tokens.\nThe additive token embeddings are transformed into another space before they are used by the memory and query components, i.e.\nxi = LReL [ P ( Eformeformi + · · · )] ,\nwhere P is the projection matrix and is shared by the memory and query components as well. The activation function of this projection layer is the leaky rectified linear (LReL) function (Mass et al., 2013) with 0.1 as the slope of the negative part. In the remaining part of the paper, we refer to xi ∈ Rp as the token embedding for word at position i. Note the subscript i is substituted by j and t for the memory and query components, respectively."

      "heading" : "2.2 Components",
      "text" : "As shown in Figure 1, the proposed BiAtt-DP has three components, i.e. a memory component, a leftto-right query component, and a right-to-left query component. Given a sentence of length n, the parser first uses a bi-directional RNN to construct n + 1 headword embeddings, m0,m1, . . . ,mn ∈ Re, with m0 reserved for the ROOT symbol. Each query component is an uni-directional attention model. In a query component, a sequence of n modifier embeddings q1, . . . ,qn ∈ Rd are constructed recursively by conditioning on all headword embeddings. To address the vanishing gradient issue in RNNs, we use the gated recurrent unit (GRU) proposed by Cho et al. (2014), where an update gate and a reset gate are employed to control the information flow. We replace the hyperbolic tangent function in GRU with the LReL function, which is faster to compute and achieves better parsing accuracy in our preliminary studies. In the following, we refer to headword and modifier embeddings as memory and query vectors, respectively.\nMemory Component: The proposed BiAtt-DP uses a bi-directional RNN to obtain the memory vectors. At time step j, the current hidden state vector hlj ∈ Re/2 (or hrj ∈ Re/2) is computed as a non-linear transformation based on the current input vector xj and the previous hidden state vector hlj−1 (or h r j+1), i.e. h l j = GRU(h l j−1,xj) (or hrj = GRU(h r j+1,xj)). Ideally, the recursive nature of the RNN allows it to capture all context information from one-side, and a bi-directional RNN can thus capture context information from both sides. We concatenate the hidden layers of the left-to-right RNN and the right-to-left RNN for the word at position j as the memory vector mj = [ hlj ;h r j ] . These memory vectors are expected to encode the words and their context information in the headword space.\nQuery Component: For each query component, we use a single-directional RNN with GRU to obtain the query vectors qj’s, which are the hidden state vectors of the RNN. Each qt is used to query the memory component, returning association scores st,j’s between the word at position t and the head-\nword at position j for j ∈ {0, · · · , n}, i.e.\nst,j = v Tφ (Cmj + Dqt) , (1)\nwhere φ(·) is the element-wise hyperbolic tangent function, and C ∈ Rh×e, D ∈ Rh×d and v ∈ Rh are model parameters. Then, we can obtain probabilities (aka attention weights), at,0, · · · , at,n, over all headwords in the sentence by normalizing st,j’s, using a softmax function\nat = softmax(st). (2)\nThe soft headword embedding is then defined as m̃t = ∑n j=1 at,jmj . At each time step t, the\nRNN takes the soft headword embedding m̃lt−1 or m̃rt+1 as the input, in addition to the token embedding xt. Formally, for the forward case, the qt can be computed as qt = GRU (qt−1, [m̃t;xt]). Although the RNN is able to capture long-span context information to some extent, the local context may very easily dominate the hidden state. Therefore, this additional soft headword embedding allows the model to access long-span context information in a different channel. On the other hand, by recursively feeding both the query vector and the soft headword embedding into the RNN, the model implicitly captures high-order parsing history information, which can potentially improve the parsing accuracy (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; McDonald and Pereira, 2006). However, for a graph-based dependency parser, utilizing parsing history features is computationally expensive. For example, an k-th order MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) has O(nk+1) complexity for a sentence of n words. In contrast, the BiAtt-DP implicitly captures high-order parsing history while keeping the complexity in the order of O(n2), i.e. for each direction. we compute n(n+1) pair-wise probabilities at,j for t = 1, · · · , n and j = 0, · · · , n.\nIn this paper, we choose to use soft headword embeddings rather than making hard decisions on headwords. In the latter case, beam search may potentially improve the parsing accuracy at the cost of higher computational complexity, i.e. O(Bn2) with a beam width of B. When using soft headword embeddings, there is no need to perform beam search. Moreover, it is straightforward to incorporate parsing history from both directions by using two query components at the cost of O(2n2), which cannot be easily achieved when using beam search. The parsing decision can be made directly based on attention weights from the two query components or further rescored by the maximum spanning tree (MST) search algorithm."

      "heading" : "2.3 Parsing by Attention with Agreement",
      "text" : "For the bi-directional attention model, the underlying probability distributions alt and a r t may not agree with each other. In order to encourage the agreement, we use the mathematically convenient metric, i.e. the squared Hellinger distance H2 ( alt||art ) , for quantifying the distance between these two distri-\nbutions. For dependency parsing, when the golden alignment is known during training, we can derive an upper bound on the latent agreement objective as\nH2(alt,a r t ) ≤ 2 √ D(gt||alt) +D(gt||art ),\nwhere D(·||·) is the KL-divergence. The complete derivation is provided in the Appendix A. During optimization, we can safely drop the constant scaler and the square root operation in the upper bound, leading to the following loss function\nD(gt||alt) +D(gt||art ) = 2D(gt||alt art ), (3)\nwhere indicates element-wise multiplication. The resulting loss function is equivalent to the crossentropy loss, which is widely adopted for training neural networks.\nAs we can see, the loss function (3) tries to minimize the distance between the golden alignment and the intersection of the two directional attention alignments at every time step. Therefore, during inference, the headword prediction for the word at time step t can be obtained as\nargmax j\nlog alt,j + log a r t,j ,\nseeking for agreement between both query components. This parsing procedure is also similar to the exhaustive left-to-right modifier-first search algorithm described in (Covington, 2001), but it is enhanced by an additional right-to-left search with the agreement enforcement. Alternatively, we can treat (log alt,j + log a r t,j) as a score of the corresponding arc and then search for the MST to form a dependency parse tree, as proposed in (McDonald et al., 2005). The MST search is achieved via the ChuLiu-Edmonds algorithm (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967), which can be implemented in O(n2) for dense graphs according to Tarjan (1977). In practice, the MST search slows down the parsing speed by 6–10%. However, it forces the parser to produce a valid tree, and we observe a slight improvement on parsing accuracy in most cases.\nAfter obtaining each modifier and its soft header embeddings, we use a single-layer perceptron to predict the head-modifier relation, i.e.\nyt = softmax ( U [ m̃lt; m̃ r t ] + W [ qlt; q r t ]) , (4)\nwhere yt,1, · · · , yt,m are the probabilities of m possible relations, and U ∈ Rm×2e and W ∈ Rm×2d are model parameters."

The joint probability of headword and relation predictions can be written as\nP (R1:n, H l 1:n, H r 1:n|w1:n)\n= n∏\nt=1\nP (Rt|w1:n)P (H lt |w1:n)P (Hrt |w1:n)\n= n∏\nt=1\nylt,Rt · a l t,Hlt · art,Hrt (5)\nwhere at each time step we assume head-modifier relations and headwords from both directions are independent with each other when conditioned on the global knowledge of the whole sentence.

From (5), we observe that it is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of the golden dependency tree (or minimizing the crossentropy) for each training sentence, i.e.\nn∑ t=1 ( log yt,relationt + log a l t,headt + log a r t,headt ) ,\nwhere at,j and yt,r are defined in (2) and (4), respectively, and relationt and headt are golden relation and headword labels, respectively. The gradients are computed via the back-propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Errors of yt come from the arc labels, whereas there are two source of errors for at, one from the headword labels and the other back-propagated from errors of yt. We use stochastic gradient descent with the Adam algorithm proposed in (Kingma and Ba, 2015). The\nlearning rate is halved at each iteration once the loglikelihood of the dev set decreases. The whole training procedure terminates when the log-likelihood decreases for the second time. All learning parameters except bias terms are initialized randomly according to the Gaussian distribution N (0, 10−2). In our experiments, we tune the initial learning rate with a step size of 0.0002, and choose the best one based on the log-likelihood on the dev set at the first epoch. Empirically, the selected initial learning rates fall in the range of [0.0004, 0.0010] for hidden layer size [128, 320], and tend to be larger when using a smaller hidden layer size, i.e. [0.0016, 0.0034] for hidden layer size around 80.

For English, we also compare with stateof-the-art graph-based dependency parsers. The results are shown in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. It can be seen that the BiAtt-DP outperforms all other graph-based parsers on PTB. Compared with\n3For English, we use the dependency-based word embeddings at https://goo.gl/tWke3I (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). For Chinese, we pre-train 192-dimension skip-gram embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) on Chinese Gigawords (Graff et al., 2005).\nthe transition-based parsers, it achieves better accuracy than Chen and Manning (2014), which uses a feed-forward neural network, and Dyer et al. (2015), which uses three stack LSTM networks. Compared with the integrated parsing and tagging models, the BiAtt-DP outperforms Bohnet and Nivre (2012) but has a small gap to Alberti et al. (2015). On CTB, it achieves best UAS and similar LAS. This may be caused by that the relation vocabulary size is relatively smaller than the average sentence length, which biases the joint objective to be more sensitive to UAS. The parsing speed is around 50–60 sents/sec measured on a desktop with Intel Core i7 CPU @ 3.33GHz using single thread.\nNext, in Table 3 we show the parsing accuracy of the proposed BiAtt-DP on 12 languages in the CoNLL 2006 shared task, including comparison with state-of-the-art parsers. Specifically, we show UAS of the 3rd-order RBGParser as reported in (Lei et al., 2014) since it also uses low-dimensional continuous embeddings. However, there are several major differences between the RBGParser and the BiAtt-DP. First, in (Lei et al., 2014), the lowdimensional continuous embeddings are derived\nfrom low-rank tensors. Second, the RBGParser uses combined scoring of arcs by including traditional features from the MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006) / TurboParser (Martins et al., 2013). Third, the RBGParser employs a third-order parsing algorithm based on (Zhang et al., 2014), although it also implements a first-order parsing algorithm, which achieves lower UAS in general. In Table 3, we show that the proposed BiAtt-DP outperforms the RBGParser in most languages except Japanese, Slovene, and Swedish.\nIt can be observed from Table 3 that the BiAttDP has highly competitive parsing accuracy as stateof-the-art parsers. Moreover, it achieves best UAS for 5 out of 12 languages. For the remaining seven languages, the UAS gaps between the BiAtt-DP and state-of-the-art parsers are within 1.0%, except Swedish. An arguably fair comparison for the BiAttDP is the MSTParser (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), since the BiAtt-DP replaces the scoring function for arcs but uses exactly the same search algorithm. Due to the space limit, we refer readers to (Lei et al., 2014) for results of the MSTParsers (also shown in Appendix B). The BiAtt-DP consistently outperforms both parser by up to 5% absolute UAS score.\nFinally, following (Pitler and McDonald, 2015), we also analyze the performance of the BiAtt-DP on both crossed and uncrossed arcs. Since the BiAtt-\nDP uses a graph-based non-projective parsing algorithm, it is interesting to evaluate the performance on crossed arcs, which result in the non-projectivity of the dependency tree. The last three columns of Table 3 show the recall of crossed arcs, that of uncrossed arcs, and the percentage of crossed arcs in the test set. Pitler and McDonald (2015) reported numbers on the same data for Dutch, German, Portuguese, and Slovene as in this paper. For these four languages, the BiAtt-DP achieves better UAS than that reported in (Pitler and McDonald, 2015). More importantly, we observe that the improvement on recall of crossed arcs (around 10–18% absolutely) is much more significant than that of uncrossed arcs (around 1–3% absolutely), which indicates the effectiveness of the BiAtt-DP in parsing languages with non-projective trees."

First of all, we start from our best model (Model 1 in Table 4) on English, which uses 300 as the token embedding dimension and 368 as the hidden layer size. We keep those model parameter dimensions unchanged and analyze different factors by comparing the parsing accuracy on PTB dev set.\nThe results are summarized in Table 4. Comparing Models 1–3, it can be observed that without using pre-trained word embeddings, both UAS and LAS drop by 0.6%, and without using POS tags in token embeddings, the numbers further drop by 1.6% in UAS and around 2.6% in LAS. In terms of query components, using single query component (Models 4–5) degrades UAS by 0.7–0.9% and LAS by around 1.0%, compared with Model 2. For Model 6, the soft headword embedding is only used for arc label predictions but not fed into the next hidden state, which is around 0.3% worse than Model 2. This supports the hypothesis about the usefulness of the parsing history information. We also implement a variant of Model 6 which produces one at instead two by using both qlt and q r t in (1). It gets 92.44% UAS and 89.26% LAS, indicating that naively applying a bi-directional RNN may not be enough."

      "text" : "Neural Dependency Parsing: Recently developed neural dependency parsers are mostly transition-based models, which read words sequentially from a buffer into a stack and incrementally build a parse tree by predicting a sequence of transitions (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003; Nivre, 2004). A feed-forward neural network is used in (Chen and Manning, 2014), where they represent the current state with 18 selected elements such as the top words on the stack and buffer. Each element is encoded by concatenated embeddings of words, POS tags, and arc labels. Their dependency parser achieves improvement\non both accuracy and parsing speed. Weiss et al. (2015) improve the parser using semi-supervised structured learning and unlabeled data. The model is extended to integrate parsing and tagging in (Alberti et al., 2015). On the other hand, Dyer et al. (2015) develop the stack LSTM architecture, which uses three LSTMs to respectively model the sequences of buffer states, stack states, and actions. Unlike the transition-based formulation, the proposed BiAtt-DP directly predicts the headword and the dependency relation at each time step. Specifically, there is no explicit representation of actions or headwords in our model. The model learns to retrieve the most relevant information from the input memory to make decisions on headwords and head-modifier relations.\nGraph-based Dependency Parsing: In addition to the transition-based parsers, another line of research in dependency parsing uses graph-based models. Graph-based parser usually build a dependency tree from a directed graph and learns to scoring the possible arcs. Due to this nature, nonprojective parsing can be done straightforwardly by most graph-based dependency parsers. The MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005) and the TurboParser (Martins et al., 2010) are two examples of graphbased parsers. The MSTParser formulates the parsing as searching for the MST, whereas the TurboParser performs approximate variational inference over a factor graph. The RBGParser proposed in (Lei et al., 2014) can also be viewed as a graph-based parser, which scores arcs using low-dimensional continuous features derived from low-rank tensors as well as features used by MSTParser/TurboParser. It also employs a sampler-based algorithm for parsing (Zhang et al., 2014).\nNeural Attention Model: The proposed BiAttDP is closely related to the memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015) for question answering, as well as the neural attention models for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and constituency parsing (Vinyals et al., 2015b). The way we query the memory component and obtain the soft headword embeddings is essentially the attention mechanism. However, different from the above studies where the alignment information is latent, in dependency parsing, the arc between the modifier and\nheadword is known during training. Thus, we can utilize these labels for attention weights. The similar idea is employed by the pointer network in (Vinyals et al., 2015a), which is used to solve three different combinatorial optimization problems."

Bi-directional decoding is expected to be advantageous over the previously developed uni-directional counterpart, because the former exploits richer contextual information. Intuitively, we can use two separate uni-directional RNNs where each one constructs its respective attended encoder context vectors for computing RNN hidden states. However, the drawback of this approach is that the decoder would often produce different alignments resulting in discrepancies for the forward and backward directions. In this paper, we design a training objective function to enforce attention agreement between both directions, inspired by the alignmentby-agreement idea from Liang et al. (2006). Specifically, we develop a dependency parser (BiAtt-DP) using a bi-directional attention model based on the memory network.",

The parsing procedure for each direction is formulated as sequentially querying the memory component that stores continuous headword embeddings. The proposed parser makes use of soft headword embeddings, allowing the model to implicitly capture high-order parsing history without dramatically increasing the computational complexity. We conduct experiments on English, Chinese, and 12 other languages from the CoNLL 2006 shared task, showing that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art unlabeled attachment scores on 6 languages.1",
