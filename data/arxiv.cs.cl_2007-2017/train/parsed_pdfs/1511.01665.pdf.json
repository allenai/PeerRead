      "text" : "Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is the computational study of people’s opinions, appraisals, attitudes, and emotions toward entities, individuals, issues, events, topics and their attributes (Liu and Zhang, 2012). The task of sentiment analysis is technically challenging and practically very useful. For example, businesses always want to find public or consumer opinions about their products and services. Consumers also need a sounding board rather than thinking alone while making decisions. With the development of Internet, opinionated texts from social media (e.g., reviews, blogs\nand micro-blogs) are used frequently for decision making, which makes automated sentiment analysis techniques more and more important. Among those tasks of the sentiment analysis, the key one is to classify the polarity of given texts. Many works have been done in recent years to improve English sentiment polarity classification. There are two categories of such works. One is called “machine learning” which is firstly proposed to determine whether a review is positive or negative by using three machine learning methods, including NB, ME and SVM (Pang et al., 2002). The other category called “semantic orientation” is applied to classify words into various classes by giving a score to each word to evaluate the strength of sentiment. And an overall score is calculated to assign the review to a specific class (Turney, 2002).\nRecently, researchers have tried to handle tasks of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the help of deep learning approaches. Among those approaches, a useful one called word2vec has attracted increasing interest. Word2vec translates words to vector representations (called word embeddings) efficiently by using skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013a). It is also proposed that the induced vector representations capture meaningful syntactic and semantic regularities, for example, “King” - “Man” + “Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen” (Mikolov et al., 2013b).\nBesides, with the advancement of information technology, for the first time in Chinese history, a huge volume of Chinese opinionated data recorded in digital form is ready for analysis. Though Chinese language plays an important role in economic\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n01 66\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nN ov\nglobalization, there are few works have been done for Chinese sentiment analysis with huge databases. It inspires us to make an empirical study on Chinese sentiment with bigger databases than usual.\nThe remain of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes related work. Section 3 describes details of the methods used in training procedure. Section 4 reports and discusses the results. Finally, we summarize our works in Section 5."

      "heading" : "2 Related work",
      "text" : "According to Liu and Zhang (2012), the sentiment analysis research mainly started from early 2000 by Turney (2002) and Pang et al. (2002). Turney (2002) firstly used a few semantically words (e.g., excellent and poor) to label other phrases with the hit counts by queries through search engines. Then, researchers had also proposed several custom techniques specifically for sentiment classification, e.g., the score function based on words in positive and negative reviews (Dave et al., 2003) and feature weighting schemes used to enhance classification accuracy (Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010). Besides, the other situation of sentiment analysis is to represent texts by vectors which indicate these words appear in the text but do not preserve word order. And a machine learning approach will be used for classification in the end. In such way, Pang et al. (2002) considered classifying documents according to standard machine learning techniques. In addition, subsequent research used more features in learning, making the main task of sentiment classification engineer an effective set of features (Pang and Lee, 2008).\nHowever, compared to English sentiment analysis, there are relatively few investigations conducted on Chinese sentiment classification until 2005 (Ye et al., 2005). Li and Sun (2007) presented a study on comparison of different machine learning approaches under different text representation schemes and feature weighting schemes. They found that SVM achieved the best performance. After that, Tan and Zhang (2008) found 6,000 or bigger for the size of features would be sufficient for Chinese sentiment analysis, and sentiment classifiers were severely dependent on domains or topics.\nNowadays, inspired by the availability of large text corpus and the success of deep learning approaches, some researchers (e.g., Collobert et al. (2011), Johnson and Zhang (2014)) deviated from traditional methods and tried to train neural networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for NLP tasks (e.g., named entity recognition and sentiment analysis). Among them, Xu and Sarikaya (2013) and Kalchbrenner et al. (2014) got some state-of-the-art performance. But the work of Collobert et al. (2011) was paid most attention for describing a unified architecture for NLP tasks which learned features by training a deep neural network even when being given very limited prior knowledge. These NLP tasks included part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named-entity recognition, language model learning and semantic role labeling."

After removing those words which do not appear in the corpus, 10444 sentiment words are preserved. After several experiments, CHI (Galavotti et al., 2000) is chosen for information gain.

There are two families of ensemble methods, averaging methods and boosting methods. In averaging methods, several estimators will be built to average their predictions. It is a kind of vote, namely, on average. The combined estimator is usually better than any of the fundamental estimators since its variance is reduced (e.g., Bagging methods and Forests of randomized trees). By contrast, in boosting methods, fundamental estimators are built sequentially and each one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator. The idea behind it is to combine several weak models to generate a more powerful ensemble model (e.g., AdaBoost and Gradient Tree Boosting).\nThe ensemble method modules are chosen from scikit-learn, including AdaBoost, Gradient Tree Boosting and Random Forests. For each Chinese review, the average value of word embeddings is used as the input."

Just as CNN used in computer vision, a matrix is needed, as the input of CNN. After several experiments, we set D = 60 as the dimension quantity of word embeddings for CNN. If there are L words in a sentence, combine their word embeddings together to construct a matrix of size L×D as shown in Figure 1. L = 60 is set since fixed L is needed, and which means, only 60 words are preserved from the beginning of a review. On the other hand, if the length is less than 60, the matrix will be filled with used vectors from the beginning of the review by repeating them. At last, every review is represented by a matrix of size 60× 60.\nFormally, in computer vision, given n images (Xl, l = 1, ..., n) of size r × c, k kernels of size\na × b are set. For each kernel patches a small image(Xs) in the large image (Xl), K(kerneli, Xs) is computed, where K() is the kernel function, giving us k × (r − a + 1) × (c − b + 1) array of convolved features (more detail,see the tutorial3). Max-pooling is the key module to help training deeper model. It works like this: Expect that there is a 60 × 60 matrix. Let’s set pooling size 10 × 10, then the 60×60 matrix will be divided into 36 small matrixes of size 10× 10. Just pick the biggest value in each small matrix and combine them together. At last a 6 × 6 matrix instead of 60 × 60 matrix is gotten. Extending the implementation 4 of the lenet5 (LeCun et al., 1998), the convolutional layer and max-pooling layer are merged as one layer. The structure of ConvNets used is shown in Table 2.\nWith the fourth layer, a fully-connect sigmoidal layer is constructed to classify the output values. After experiments, there are some rules can be concluded:\n• The quantity of the word embedding dimensions shall be more than 50.\n• Do not use pooling between the dimensions of word embedding (thus, in Table 2, the size of pooling is 2×1).\n• Adding more fully-connect sigmoidal layer dose not help in improving F1 score.\n3http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php 4http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html#lenet"

      "text" : "Unlike English corpuses, Chinese corpuses are relatively small and usually focus on POS tagging (Mingqin et al., 2003), parsing (Xue et al., 2005) and translating (Xiao, 2010). In Chinese sentiment classification, the most popular corpus is ChnSentiCorp (Tan and Zhang, 2008) with 7,000 positive reviews and 3,000 negative reviews5. Since the amount of data collected by previous Chinese NLP researchers is too small for our work, we build a new corpus, MioChnCorp, with a million Chinese hotel reviews. The corpus is public and can be downloaded directly6. The reviews are crawled and filtrated from the website7 which has coarse-grained rating (5-star scale) for each review. We give up the 3-star reviews which may be ambiguous, and mark the five-star and four-star reviews as positive and the rest as negative. Finally 908189 positive reviews and 101762 negative reviews are obtained. After word segmentation8 being done, the sentiment classification process is executed.\nSince ChnSentiCorp is small, the result may be unstable.

Zhai et al. (2011) tried to get a believable result using the average value from 30 experiments. See Figure 2, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression are used as classification methods to show the performance curves with different amount of reviews. The first sub-graph is tested on ChnSentiCorp, the second on is tested on MioChNCorp. Balanced corpuses are split into 3 equal-sized folds, two for training, the rest for testing. After repeating each experiment five times, the best performance and worst performance are marked. At last, two conclusions can be made: Firstly, when the amount of reviews is less than 60,000, the performance will be improbable (the best performance of model minus worst performance is bigger than 0.01). Secondly, more data usually help to get better performance, but the performance will be finally stable when data are big enough (e.g., 120,000 reviews)."

CNN use the matrix constructed by word embeddings from words in a review as feature.\nThough all of these models are effective, the combination of different machine learning methods is supposed to acquire better F1 score. There are two ways to combine those methods. First is vote, the idea is simple, “the minority is subordinate to the majority” (marked as Vote all ). The other way is to over-fit in the validate set. Add one more fold for validating into these tree folds. After training, nine models will be constructed. And each model gives one predication list for validating set. For each review, there are nine predications (e.g., [0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 ], 0 means negative, 1 means positive). Using the predication vectors of validating reviews as input, and the labels of validating reviews as the Logistic Regression output, after training on validating set, the combination model (called LR all) is built to test on testing set.

With 10-fold cross-validation, CfsSubsetEval attribute evaluator and BestFisrt search Method, Weka selects five most valuable attributes (ME, SVC, LinearSVC, RF and CNN). It is reasonable because they are most outstanding machine learning models which represent their own feature selection methods. Considering the limit of hardware resource and running time, LR is used to instead of SVC and CNN is abandoned. The result is shown in Figure 3.

Three ensemble methods work similarly and bigger data help to improve their\nperformance obviously. There may be three reasons why CNN works better than NB and ME, but does not reach the expectant performance. Firstly, the amount of reviews is not big enough to train a deep learning model. Secondly, the architecture of the model may not be enough suitable as a language model. Finally, the features (word embeddings with 60 dimensions) for CNN is not accurate enough to present syntax and semantics in sentence. Vote all does not work well in improving performance, but has the highest negative recall and positive precision. LR all has better performance than Vote all because the same weights chosen by Vote all make these sub-models are equally important."

Firstly, a Chinese opinion corpus is built with a million comments from hotel review websites. Then the word embeddings which represent each comment are used as input in different machine learning methods for sentiment classification, including SVM, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and ensemble methods. These methods get better performance compared with N-gram models using Naive Bayes (NB) and Maximum Entropy (ME). Finally, a combination of machine learning methods is proposed which presents an outstanding performance in precision, recall and F1 score. After selecting the most useful methods to construct the combinational model and testing over the corpus, the final F1 score is 0.920.",
