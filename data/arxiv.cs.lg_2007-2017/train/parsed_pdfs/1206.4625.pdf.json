F-measures are usually preferred to accuracies as standard performance measures in information retrieval (Manning et al., 2008), particularly, when relevant items are rare. They are also popular in information extraction tasks such as named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang & De Meulder, 2003) where most of the elements do not belong to a named class.\nVarious methods have been proposed for optimizing Fmeasures. They fall into two paradigms. The empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns a classifier having optimal F-measure on the training data. Optimizing the F-measure directly is often difficult as the F-measure is non-convex. Thus approximation methods are often used instead. Joachims (2005) gave an efficient algorithm for maximizing a convex lower bound of F-measures for support vector machines, and showed it worked well on text classification. Jansche (2005) gave an efficient algorithm to maximize a non-convex approximation to F-measures using logistic regression models, and showed it works well on a text summarization problem. A simpler method is to optimize the F-measure in two stages: First learn a score function using standard methods such as logistic regression or support vector machines, then select a threshold for the score function to maximize the empirical F-measure. Though simple, this method has been found to be effective and is commonly applied, for example, in text categorization (Yang, 2001).\nThe decision-theoretic approach (DTA), advocated by Lewis (1995), estimates a probability model first, and then computes the optimal predictions (in the sense of having highest expected F-measure) according to the model. This method has not been commonly applied for F-measures, possibly due to the high computa-\ntional complexity of existing algorithms for the prediction step. Assuming the independence of labels, Lewis showed that, in the optimal prediction, the probabilities of being positive for irrelevant items are not more than those for relevant items. He also gave a bound for expected F-measures, which can be computed in O(n) time, but can be very loose. Based on Lewis’s characterization, Chai (2005) gave an O(n3) time algorithm to compute optimal predictions, and he gave empirical demonstration for the effectiveness of DTA. Apparently unaware of Chai’s work, Jansche (2007) solved the same problem in O(n4) time. For the general case when the labels are not necessarily independent, Dembczynski et al. (2011) gave an O(n3) time algorithm given n2+1 parameters of the label distribution, but the parameters can be expensive to compute. They also showed that the independence assumption can lead to bad performance in the worst case, but on the practical datasets used in their experiments, methods assuming the independence assumption are at least as good as those not assuming independence.\nWe have only discussed works on binary classification. There are also algorithms for optimizing F-measures for tasks with structured output (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2006; Daumé et al., 2009) and multilabel tasks (Fan & Lin, 2007; Zhang et al., 2010; Petterson & Caetano, 2010).\nOptimality in EUM and DTA are different. EUM considers only instance classifiers (functions mapping instances to labels), and roughly speaking, an optimal classifier is an instance classifier having highest F-measure on a very large test set among all instance classifiers. On the other hand, DTA considers set classifiers (functions mapping sets of instances to sets of labels), and an optimal classifier in DTA is a set classifier having maximum expected F-measure among all set classifiers. Optimality in these two approaches are also achieved differently using different learning objectives. Unless otherwise stated, optimal classifiers refer to EUM-optimal classifiers, and optimal predictions refer to predictions by DTA-optimal classifiers.\nIn this paper, we study the relative effectiveness of the two approaches, and develop theories and algorithms for this purpose. We focus on binary classification, assuming the data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The contributions of this paper are as follows. In Section 2, we establish a consistency result for empirical maximization of F-measures, together with bounds on the rate of convergence. This provides some insights into the factors affecting the convergence rate in EUM. In particular, our bounds suggest that rare classes require more data for performance guar-\nantee, which is consistent with our intuition. We then show that thresholding the true conditional distribution on a large i.i.d. test set can perform as well as the best instance classifier, justifying the popular hybrid approach of learning a conditional distribution followed by learning a threshold. We also show that an EUM-optimal classifier and a DTA-optimal classifier are asymptotically equivalent if the probability measure for any set of instances with the same conditional probability of being relevant is negligible.\nIn Section 3, we give a new O(n2) time algorithm for computing optimal predictions, assuming independence of labels. Our algorithm can compute optimal predictions on tens of thousand instances within seconds, significantly faster than previous algorithms which require hours or more. 1\nIn Section 4, we compare EUM and DTA on synthetic and real datasets. Our theoretical results are useful in explaining the experimental results. Empirically, EUM seems more robust against model misspecification, but given a good model, DTA seems better for handling rare classes on small datasets and a common scenario of domain adaptation."

A rank-preserving function is an optimal score function.\nBy Theorem 5, we can sidestep learning the true distribution and instead try to learn a function which is likely to be rank-preserving.

We shall give an asymptotic equivalence result for EUM-optimal classifiers and DTA-optimal classifiers on large i.i.d test sets.

In general, optimal predictions may not satisfy this constraint (Lewis, 1995). However, if the underlying distribution satisfies that P (P (1|X) = δ) = 0 for any δ, then the above result is essentially this: given P , an optimal prediction and the prediction using the optimal threshold are asymptotically equivalent. This is demonstrated empirically in Section 4."

Strictly, this is a combination of the conditional probability estimation and F-measure optimization of the threshold, and the convergence rate in Theorem 3 does not apply.\nJansche (2005) learned a logistic regression model p(Y |X,φ) by maximizing the empirical Fβ in eq. 1, but with each binary decision si replaced by the predictive probabilities pi = p(1|xi, φ). The eventual classifier uses the rule h(x) = I(p(1|x) > 0.5). It is unknown whether this method is consistent or whether it follows any asymptotic convergence. There is also no apparent reason to use 0.5 as the threshold, so we shall optimize the threshold on the training data in addition to estimating φ.

Thus S is the distance between the centers. We shall vary S, O, D, π1 and the number of training examples Ntr. All instances are i.i.d. The optimal F1 achievable by a classifier θ can be computed (see eq. 2), and it depends only on S and π1. Ntr determines how close the estimated distribution is to the optimal model; and the number of test examples, Nts, affects the gap in the performance between the thresholding method and the expectation method (Theorem 8).\nWe train logistic regression (LR) models using three different attribute vector representations: R0 consists of the coordinates only, R1 is R0 with an additional dummy attribute fixed at 1, and R2 is R1 with additional all degree two monomials of the coordinates. LR with R2 includes the true distribution. The methods compared are MLδ, Fδ, MLE , Truthδ and TruthE , where last two methods use the true model P (X,Y ) for thresholding and expectation.\nThe first column in Table 1 lists the parameter settings. For the row headed by Default, we use D = 10, S = 4, O = 0, Ntr = 1000, Nts = 3000, and π1 = 0.5. This dataset is low dimensional, almost noiseless, balanced and has sufficiently many train and test in-\nstances.4 Each of the remaining rows uses the same set of parameters, except for the one parameter indicated on the first column. LR with R0 or R1 contains a good approximation to the true distribution for all settings except π1 = 0.05 and O = 50. For π1 = 0.05, the class is imbalanced and such imbalance cannot be modelled without the dummy attribute. Thus R0 will not give a good model, but R1 will. For O = 50, the centers are far from the origin, and this makes both R0 and R1 inadequate for density estimation.\nIn Table 1, the F1 results for Truth E , Truthδ and Theory (the theoretical optimal F1) are similar. These are expected according to Theorem 8. Most other scores are close to the optimal scores. For MLE and MLδ, these scores are expected due to the presence of a good approximation to the true distribution in the model family, and the asymptotic convergence property of MLδ and MLE given sufficiently many examples, as discussed in Section 3. For Fδ, although we lack its theoretical convergence to an optimal classifier, the results suggest that such convergence may hold.\nThe scores obtained using R2 are generally lower than scores obtained using R0 and R1 under the settings Default, S = 0.4, D = 100, and Ntr = 100, though R2 gives a well-specified model class while R1 and R0 do not. Thus, a well-specified model class is not necessarily better. This is because a misspecified model class with a small VC dimension can converge to the optimal model within the class using fewer samples than a well-specified model class with a higher VC dimension. To choose a class of the right complexity, one may follow the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1995). This requires bounds like those in Lemma 2 and Theorem 3. However, the given bounds cannot be used because they only apply for large samples.\nThe gaps between R2 scores and the optimal score for Default is significantly smaller than the gaps for S =\n4We have verified that the sizes are large enough to give the same conclusions for other i.i.d. data of the same sizes.\n0.4, D = 100, Ntr = 100, and π1 = 0.05. This suggests that higher noise level, higher model class complexity, smaller training size, and smaller positive ratio make it harder to learn a good classifier. Note that Theorem 3 already suggests that in EUM, smaller positive ratio can make learning more difficult.\nFor the setting π1 = 0.05, using R0, ML E performs poorly, while MLδ is close to optimal. MLE ’s poor performance is expected due to poor quality of the learned distribution, and MLδ’s performance can be justified by Theorem 5: the thresholding method can remain optimal when the score function is rank-preserving but not close to the true probability distribution. For the setting O = 50, both MLE and MLδ perform poorly using R0, but ML\nδ is much better than MLE using R1. Thus although ML\nδ can still be severely affected by model misspecification, it is still relatively robust. In addition, for π1 = 0.05 and O = 50, F\nδ has much higher or at least comparable scores than MLE and MLδ. This suggests that if the model class is severely misspecified, then EUM can be more robust than DTA.\nWe also compare MLE and MLδ on small test sets with Nts = 100 (Theorem 8 only holds for large test set size). We observed similar performances from MLδ and MLE when π1 is high, but ML E seems significantly better than MLδ when π1 is small. To illustrate, Table 2 gives the results when the same setting as π1 = 0.05 in Table 1 is used to generate the data. It shows that, with a sufficiently accurate model, MLE can be better than MLδ and Fδ on rare classes."

These are plotted in Figure 1(b), where 1− F1 is plotted instead of F1. Figures 1(a) and 1(c) plot for similar experiments, but using 0.1 and 0.9 as the true π1 instead. Our choice of S = 2 instead of S = 4 for the true distribution has made the difference between the true and assumed distributions more pronounced in the plots. Comparing the curves for KL and 1− F1 within each figure, we see that the F-measure of DTA is roughly positively correlated with the model quality. The plot for 1− F1 in Figure 1(a) exhibits higher curvature around the true π1 than those in the other two figures.

We train two models: the standard multinomial näıve Bayes (NB) model and a LR model, using word occurrence counts and a dummy attribute fixed at one. Both models are regularized. For NB, we use the Laplace corrector with one count for class and word counts. For LR, we use the Gaussian norm on the parameters. We use only those topics with at least C positive instances in both the train and test sets, and we vary C. Table 3 reports macro-F1 scores (the F1 averaged over topics), where ML.5 uses 0.5 to threshold the probabilities,\nIn Table 3, although NB generally does not provide good probability estimates, MLE is still at least comparable to ML.5 and MLδ. With LR, MLE is a few percents better for rare classes. Chai (2005) used Gaussian process and obtained similar conclusion."

Each bracketed score is higher than its non-bracketed counterpart, thus models closer to the true one perform better for both MLE and MLδ.

We empirically demonstrated that EUM seems more robust against model misspecification, while given a good model, DTA seems better for handling rare classes and a common domain adaptation scenario.\nA few important questions are unanswered yet: existence of interesting classifiers for which EUM can be done exactly, quantifying the effect of inaccurate models on optimal predictions, identifying conditions under which one method is preferable to another, and practical methods for selecting the best method on a dataset. Results in this paper only hold for large data sets, and it is important to consider the case for small number of instances. Experiments with and analyses of other methods may yield additional insights as well."

Algorithms for learning to maximize F-measures follow two approaches: the empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns a classifier having optimal performance on training data, while the decision-theoretic approach learns a probabilistic model and then predicts labels with maximum expected F-measure. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical justifications and connections for these two approaches, and we study the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other using synthetic and real datasets. Given accurate models, our results suggest that the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent given large training and test sets. Nevertheless, empirically, the EUM approach appears to be more robust against model misspecification, and given a good model, the decision-theoretic approach appears to be better for handling rare classes and a common domain adaptation scenario.",
