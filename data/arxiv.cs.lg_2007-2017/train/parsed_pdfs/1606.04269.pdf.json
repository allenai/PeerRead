      "text" : "Exposing the latent knowledge present in geospatial trajectories has become an increasingly important research topic in recent years, due in part to the pervasiveness of location-aware hardware and the resulting availability of trajectory data. Motivated by a desire to understand the movement patterns of users, this paper presents a new data structure, the context tree, that summarises the context behind user actions in a single hierarchical model. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for generating context trees from geospatial trajectories and land usage information, and provides concrete implementations for each stage of the method, namely augmentation, filtering, and clustering. A context tree itself is formed of clusters at multiple scales that describe the contexts in which the user was immersed, a↵ording easy access to information that would have previously remained hidden, forming the basis for understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups.\nExisting work in understanding people through the context of activities has considered various attributes as defining context, including an individual’s location, the current time and weather, and other individuals who are nearby [Dey and Abowd, 1999; Schilit et al., 1994], typically using data collected from smartphones [Bao et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2010; Huai et al., 2014]. While existing approaches provide a basis for context-aware applications, they are limited by the data that can be collected directly from the user. Augmenting geospatial trajectories with land usage information enables the identification of contexts that consider the type and properties of the location of an activity.\nIn this paper we present the following contributions: (i) the context tree data structure that hierarchically represents user contexts at multiple scales, (ii) a method for constructing context trees from geospatial trajectories and land usage information, (iii) a set of concrete techniques to achieve each stage in the construction method, namely augmentation, filtering and clustering, (iv) evaluation of context trees constructed from real-world data, and an analysis of the properties that make them amenable for\nAuthors’ contact details: {Alasdair.Thomason, Nathan.Gri ths, V.F.Sanchez-Sliva}@warwick.ac.uk\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 26\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.D S]\n1 4\nJu n\n20 16\nuse in understanding individuals, and (v) a method of pruning context trees, to reduce their size while retaining useful information.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows.

      "text" : "Geospatial trajectories, usually collected from GPS logging devices, have been used as a basis for knowledge acquisition in many areas, including for location extraction [Andrienko et al., 2011; Ashbrook and Starner, 2002, 2003; Bamis and Savvides, 2011; Montoliu and Gatica-Perez, 2010; Thomason et al., 2015a, 2016]. Periods of low mobility are extracted from the trajectories and clustered using techniques such as DBSCAN [Ester et al., 1996] and k-means [MacQueen, 1967], identifying areas in which the time was spent. These techniques identify areas of arbitrary shape, but are incapable of identifying places where non-stationary activities took place. Augmenting identified areas with additional information, Yan et al. [2013] propose a technique for the derivation and modelling of semantic trajectories. However, the additional data sources are not leveraged for identifying locations, only for providing labelling after locations have been identified.\nOnce identified, significant locations have formed the basis for many applications, including location prediction using Markov models [Ashbrook and Starner, 2002, 2003], neural networks [Thomason et al., 2015c], periodicity-based approaches [Wang and Prabhala, 2012], and blockmodels [Fukano et al., 2013]. Using multilayer perceptrons for location prediction, Thomason et al. [2015b] evaluate extracted locations and predictions to perform automatic parameter selection for location extraction and prediction. Research has also considered predicting when a user will next visit a specific location using Bayesian inference [Gao et al., 2012], how long a user will stay at a given location [Liu et al., 2013], as well as developing techniques to apply labels in a semi-supervised manner to extracted locations to provide additional meaning [Krumm and Rouhana, 2013]. Prediction has also occurred without the need for location extraction, in the form of destination prediction, achieved by identifying similar historical trajectories to a current one through clustering approaches [Chen et al., 2010; Monreale et al., 2009; Nakahara and Murakami, 2012], Bayesian inference [Krumm and Horvitz, 2006] and hidden Markov models [Alvarez-Garcia et al., 2010]. Similarly, predicting journey duration has been explored using neural networks [Chen et al., 2009], along with predicting when two people will next meet [Yu et al., 2015], and providing recommendations to users new to a city based on the locations visited by others [Bao et al., 2015; Zheng and Xie, 2010].\nWhile trajectories have also been used to identify non-stationary activities, in the form of transport mode identification through change-point detection and classification-based approaches [Liao et al., 2007; Patterson et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2008a,b], many related techniques operate on di↵erent sources of data. Activity detection has been achieved from video data by Kim et al. [2010], who use Markov models to identify the activities being performed. Unfortunately, ensuring the constant availability of video data on an individual is infeasible. Research has therefore considered identifying the activity being performed from low-level sensor data (e.g. accelerometers and heart-rate) generated by devices carried by individuals, using classifiers and related techniques to label periods of data from a set of possible activities [Choudhury et al., 2008; Lee and Mase, 2002; Lester et al., 2005; Morris and Trivedi, 2011; Pirttikangas et al., 2006; Ravi et al., 2005].\nContext, situation, and intention awareness have also been considered, where a context aims to identify times when a user was performing the same task, without necessarily knowing what the task is. Literature in this domain has explored using entropy-based clustering to identify contexts [Bao et al., 2011], and sequence-based approaches that consider the transitions between contexts [Lemlouma and Layaida, 2004]. Utilising contexts, research has also focused on developing architectures and applications that adapt devices based on the current context [Anagnostopoulos et al., 2006; Lemlouma and Layaida, 2004]. Situation and intention awareness is more focused on developing tools and techniques to aid a person in conducting a particular task to achieve some goal [Howard and Cambria, 2013; Vinciarelli\net al., 2015], with specific examples in defence [Howard, 2002] and aviation [Endsley, 1995, 2000]. As with location extraction, however, existing techniques focus only on collected data, and do not attempt to augment this with other data available after collection. Such augmentation could o↵er greater insight into the entities a person was interacting with, enabling a better understanding of the actions they were performing.\nFocusing on only trajectories, literature has also considered the identification of repeating patterns, both from geospatial trajectories [Cao et al., 2005, 2007; Eagle and Pentland, 2009; Giannotti et al., 2007; Gudmundsson et al., 2004], and general object movement trajectories [Li et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2003], where repeating patterns are expected to consist of activities that the user repeatedly conducts. Such patterns have also been considered as routines, where the aim is to extract features of a given day for classification (e.g. “left work at 5PM”) [Farrahi and Gatica-Perez, 2008, 2010]. Patterns, and extracted location transitions, have formed the basis of user similarity identification [Xiao et al., 2012], and travel companion identification [Tang et al., 2012]. Once expected patterns for a given user or group have been extracted, anomalous actions become possible to identify. Anomaly detection has been performed on geospatial trajectories, where isolation-based outlier detection has identified anomalous subtrajectories from vehicle tracking data [Chen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011]. Similarly, statistical approaches have been shown to be useful in identifying trajectories that di↵er from an expected pattern [Laxhammar and Falkman, 2011, 2014; Rosen and Medvedev, 2012].\nRaw geospatial trajectories have been used as the basis for many di↵erent tasks and applications. While assuming the availability of additional data at time of collection is often infeasible, augmenting trajectories after collection is possible and can enrich the knowledge a↵orded. Applications that consider such augmented trajectories include using map data to fill in missing periods of a trajectory [Zheng et al., 2012], and using map searches augmented with trajectories from the same user to enhance destination prediction [Wu et al., 2015]. While existing work by Yan et al. [2013] has considered the augmentation of trajectories to understand the semantics behind trajectory segments, they do not attempt to utilise the semantics to influence the partitioning of trajectories or identify contexts. Understanding the semantics behind trajectories from the beginning has the potential to better understand what a person was doing and their interactions, and thus provide a foundation for identifying similar contexts."

      "heading" : "2.1 Geospatial Datasets",
      "text" : "Although it is increasingly becoming easier to collect geospatial data due to the proliferation of locationaware devices such as smartphones, the availability of public geospatial datasets still presents a challenge for researchers. Privacy concerns are the main obstacle to making such data publicly available, and consequently there are only a limited number of public datasets, each having certain drawbacks. To overcome these issues, many researchers have collected data themselves for use in their work [Ashbrook and Starner, 2003; Si la-Nowicka et al., 2015; Thomason et al., 2015a]. However, using such private datasets decreases the reproducibility of work and thus the use of public data is preferred. Such publicly available datasets include MIT’s Reality Mining dataset [Eagle and Sandy Pentland, 2005], which uses cell towers to estimate the locations of devices belonging to 100 students. More recently, GPS-enabled devices have been used for data collection to produce Microsoft’s GeoLife Trajectories [Zheng et al., 2008a, 2009, 2010], Nokia’s Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset [Kiukkonen et al., 2010; Laurila et al., 2012], and the Yonsei dataset [Chon et al., 2011]. While all of these datasets are available for research purposes, they have their own caveats. The Yonsei dataset contains only 2 months worth of data, while the GeoLife and MDC datasets contain vast amounts of data collected over several years from hundreds of users. The GeoLife dataset is focused on when participants were moving, and therefore does not provide continuous data. The MDC dataset, on the other hand, aims to provide continuous data collected from smartphones, although for privacy reasons the areas surrounding the known residences of participants have their accuracies significantly reduced in the data. Despite this, and due to its continuous collection methodology, the MDC dataset is still one of the most accurate and representative datasets available, containing real-world data collected from the smartphones carried by nearly 200 users over a span of 2 years. The MDC dataset also includes accuracy values, indicating how much confidence can be placed in the recorded coordinates, information which is not provided with GeoLife."

      "heading" : "2.2 Investigative Techniques",
      "text" : "For many techniques relating to extracting knowledge from data, collecting a concrete ground truth is infeasible. Significant location extraction, for example, can extract locations at various scales and so no single ground truth can exist. Existing literature addresses this by exploring the properties of the outputs from such techniques and comparing these properties to expected results. For instance, Guidotti et al. [2015] create synthetic trajectories with known properties and devise metrics to compare extracted locations with desirable properties. Thomason et al. [2015a] compare properties of the identified locations against acceptable ranges of values, determined from knowledge of the input data, as well as demonstrating the applicability of the technique through examples. For travel-mode classification, Si laNowicka et al. [2015] compare against a small set of manually labelled subtrajectories. In this paper, to cope with the limited availability of user-provided ground truth, we present an evaluation that both compares the output of the proposed approach to a limited ground truth and characterises the outputs of the algorithm through a set of metrics. While a ground truth may not exist in all domains, an understanding of the performance and applicability of the proposed approach can be achieved through characterising the outputs and manually generating or labelling subsets of the data to create a partial ground truth."

      "heading" : "3 Proposed Structure: The Context Tree",
      "text" : "This paper proposes and evaluates the context tree hierarchical data structure, that summarises the contexts that a user has been immersed within at multiple scales. Each leaf node of the tree represents a real-world feature or element that the user has likely interacted with, be it a specific building, area, or individual feature (e.g. a bench in a park). These individual elements are joined together through context nodes that represent a context at a specific scale, where time spent within a context means that the user likely had similar aims or goals, and are identified by exploring time the user spends interacting with elements with similar properties, or elements that are interacted with in a similar manner. As it summarises time in this way, the context tree can become the basis for understanding people from augmented geospatial data. The context tree structure is depicted in Figure 1.\nGenerating a context tree requires both a geospatial trajectory and a dataset of land usage features, along with a multi-stage process for augmentation, filtering and clustering this data into a useful structure. The remainder of this paper presents the proposed method for generating context trees, provides an evaluation of context trees, and presents a method of pruning context trees to reduce their size while maintaining information. The method for augmenting geospatial trajectories with land usage information, to summarise contexts into a context tree, consists of the following five stages, as depicted in Figure 2."

      "text" : "In order to better understand users through their past actions, and assuming only geospatial data is available at the point of data collection, this section describes the process of trajectory augmentation that combines raw trajectories with land usage data. A trajectory is a temporally ordered sequence of data points that locate an individual or entity:\nT = (p1, p2, p3, ..., pn)\nwhere pi = {ti, li, ai} is an individual trajectory point, consisting of time (ti), location (li, e.g. a < lat, lng > pair) and accuracy (ai, typically measured in metres).\nIn addition to such trajectories, land usage data can also be used for identifying locations and entities that are meaningful to the user. Land usage data is assumed to be sets of entities with associated information. An entity, in this case, directly maps to a single real-world object, feature, or area, such as an individual postbox, field, or building. It can also refer to a collection of such entities that form a larger designation, such as a university campus or residential housing area. Each of these elements is expected to be associated with a set of geographical coordinate pairs that represent its shape and location, in addition to a set of tags in the form of ‘key:value’ pairs that describe properties of the element, including its type and usage (e.g. a house may be tagged as ‘building:residential’)."

This procedure is completed automatically by iterating through each trajectory point and querying the land usage dataset for any element that intersects or covers any part of the accuracy radius."

To cope with these noise elements a filtering\nprocedure can be used. Our proposed filter is a generalised version of a weighted average filter, a technique typically used to smooth noisy signals, modified to operate over sets of land usage elements and depicted in Figure 4. The filter maintains a bu↵er of elements and selects from this bu↵er based on an assigned weight in a three-step process:\n1. A bu↵er of points, and associated land usage data, is selected.\n2. The land usage elements in the bu↵er are weighted and scored.\n3. Elements are selected, based on their score, for inclusion in the output."

Since we are dealing with sets, rather than the filter simply averaging values over the bu↵er, the process is modified by assigning weighted scores to each set element and then selecting elements according to a threshold. Combining these factors into a score, we have:\nScore(e) = X\np2Pe\n✓ 1 ap ⇥ ✓ 1 dist(p, pc) ◆◆ ⇥ |Pe| (1)\nwhere Pe is the set of all points that are associated with element e, ap is the accuracy value of point p (in metres, such that low values indicate that there is likely to be less noise), pc is the point under consideration, is the width of the bu↵er (i.e. the maximum number of seconds from pc to consider) and\ndist(p1, p2) is the number of seconds between points p1 and p2 (temporal distance).

While soft-thresholding removes the need to apply a fixed threshold, for this work we are only concerned with whether or not an element is included in the output set and thus we employ a threshold, t, where any element with a NormalisedScore of greater than t becomes part of the output set, and the remaining elements are discarded."

An example summary is shown in Figure 4 (right).\nIf the time between consecutive points is large, it cannot be known whether the user ceased interacting with an element and resumed again before data collection next occurred, and so a limit on the time between consecutive points is specified as tmax. If the time between two consecutive points associated with the same element is greater than tmax, then the interactions are split, a technique also used in location extraction applications [Montoliu and Gatica-Perez, 2010; Thomason et al., 2016].

At each round of clustering, several of these clusters are merged to represent a context and a new higher level in the hierarchy, with pointers between the levels considered as parent and child relationships. That is, if two clusters at one level become merged into another cluster at the next level, the original clusters are considered as children of the new cluster. This section describes how clusters are merged with respect to their properties.\nAs discussed in Section 4, land usage elements are assumed to have a set of tags in the form of ‘key:value’ pairs that describe properties of the real-world entity to which the element relates, in addition to geographical coordinate sets that describe the geographical properties of the real-world entity. Once augmented and summarised, these elements are also associated with a set of times. When clusters are merged to create a context tree, the following procedures are used:\nTimes The times for the merged cluster are taken to be the union of the sets of times from all child clusters, where overlapping time ranges are themselves combined into one. For example, if one cluster had the set of times {10:00-10:05, 11:00-12:00} and another had {10:04-10:20, 11:10-11:15, 12:05-12:09}, then the merged times would be {10:00-10:20, 11:00-12:00, 12:05-12:09}.\nTags Similarly, each element has associated tags. The tags of the merged cluster are defined as the union of tags from the child clusters, where if two tags share a key but not a value, both values are stored.\nGeographical Coordinate Sets Each element contains a set of coordinates that define the geographical shape of the entity to which they relate. Merging such elements should keep each of these sets discrete, unless they intersect in which case the coordinates belonging to both shapes are combined and replaced with their convex hull.\nThe merging of Times assumes a periodicity of 24 hours, which while reasonable for many people (i.e. those who follow a daily routine), it may not be appropriate for everyone. As such, automatic time series learning could be utilised to better learn meaningful movement patterns of the individual. While exploring such techniques is beyond the scope of this paper, there are many existing approaches that may be e↵ective for the task [Ahmad et al., 2004]. An example merging of two elements according to these rules is shown in Figure 5, where it is assumed that there is no geographical overlap between the two elements (i.e. the coordinate sets cannot be merged)."

While traditional clustering is limited in that it extracts clusters at a single scale, which may not be appropriate for a given task, hierarchical clustering identifies clusters at multiple scales. We use a greedy hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm, presented in Algorithm 2, that extracts clusters of increasing similarity up to a single root node, creating a context tree. While the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm is fairly standard in itself, its application to the generation of context trees is novel. The algorithm deviates slightly from existing hierarchical clustering approaches in that it is capable of extracting multiple clusters together in a single step if they have the same distance."

      "text" : "In this work it is not practical to obtain a concrete ground truth to act as a point of comparison for evaluation because the correctness of an extracted set of clusters depends on the task for which the clusters will be used. In light of this, we opt to evaluate the proposed techniques with an approach similar to those followed in existing literature where a single ground truth does not exist, as discussed in Section 2.2. This is achieved by exploring the properties of the generated context trees and comparing them against expected results while providing small, representative, examples that demonstrate the\nutility a↵orded by these procedures. This section evaluates the proposed context tree data structure, along with the generation method proposed in Sections 4 and 5. Although there are many use-cases for context trees, including as a basis for anomaly detection, location prediction and city planning, we focus on understanding the high-level behaviours of an individual throughout a 24 hour period as a representative example.\nFigure 6 shows sample data at each stage of the augmentation and filtering process. Raw trajectory data, in the form of an ordered array of points (Step 1) enters the system. Each point has timestamp, longitude, latitude and accuracy values. Step 2 augments the trajectory with identifiers for all land usage elements that the user could have been interacting with at that time (as described in Section 4). This is achieved by extracting all land usage elements within the radius of the accuracy of the point and storing the identifier of each element. Step 3 shows the augmented trajectory once filtered (as described in Section 4.2), which reduces the number of elements associated with each point, with the goal of limiting them to the elements likely being interacted with. Finally, summarisation occurs, clustering together contiguous time periods that belong to the same element (as described in Section 4.3), shown in Step 4.\nOnce a summarised dataset has been created, a context tree can be generated using the metrics and algorithm presented in Section 5. Generating a context tree from 24 hours of data produces a fairly large tree, an extract of which is shown in Figure 7. A more in-depth analysis of the clustering procedure is presented in Section 6.5."

The trajectories used are taken from the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) Dataset [Kiukkonen et al., 2010; Laurila et al., 2012], as discussed in Section 2.1. From this dataset, we select the real-world data from 40 users with the largest number of trajectory points for this evaluation. While this dataset contains a vast amount of information, we only consider the timestamp, latitude, longitude and accuracy of each data point (consistent with the discussion in Section 4). In addition to this, and for comparative purposes, we also select 5 users from the GeoLife dataset [Zheng et al., 2008a, 2009, 2010] for evaluation. While the MDC dataset aims to provide continuous coordinates for the users, the GeoLife data instead only captures periods of times when the users were moving. It has the additional drawback of not including accuracy values, which are required for this work. As the data was collected using GPS-enabled devices, we opt to assume a constant accuracy of 10m for each coordinate, in line with the expected performance of GPS [Cao et al., 2009]. The trends presented in this section are consistent across both the MDC and GeoLife data, and so most of the GeoLife results are omitted for brevity, however an example can be found in Section 6.5.\nA major drawback of using research datasets is that licences often prevent the publication of details that can be used to identify people or specific locations visited. Additionally, it is not possible to contact the users about whom data was collected to perform a user study. To get around these issues, we also collect a small dataset of our own. Aiming to match the methodology of the MDC data, trajectories were collected from the smartphones of 3 members of the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick for a period of 3 days. These trajectories are used for illustration, instead of the MDC data, in Section 6.4 where the presented results contain the names of specific locations visited, and communication with the users was required.\nLand usage information comes from OpenStreetMap (OSM)1, a community-maintained map that\n1https://openstreetmap.org/\ncontains information pertaining to real-world entities, including their geographical coordinates and a set of tags that describe the entity. These entities include features such as individual items (e.g. a payphone or postbox), through to buildings and general land-usage designations (e.g. ‘farmland’). The data is extremely detailed and accurate, spanning the entire world in a consistent manner, and thus forms an ideal basis for this work.

This section evaluates and characterises the performance of the filter on real-world data, by first exploring how element weights are distributed and then showing how this impacts the land usage elements that are filtered.\nFiltering takes two parameters: and t. The parameter specifies the width of the bu↵er, in seconds, and t specifies a threshold where elements with a calculated weight of greater than t form the output set. Holding = 1200, Figure 8 shows the distribution of weights for all elements in the filtering process (i.e. the values of NormalisedScore from Equation 2) for all 11,575 trajectory points belonging to a sample MDC user. The e↵ects of t (with = 1200) and (with t = 0.8) on the average number of elements per point post-filtering can be seen in Figures 9a and 9b, respectively. These results are consistent with expectations, as increasing t sets a higher threshold for elements to be included in the output set, and thus results in fewer elements. Increasing results in a greater time span considered by the filtering process, and so more elements are considered as transient, and are thus removed. Each of these figures is generated from 7 months of data from a single sample user, and while the exact numbers vary when using data from di↵erent users, the trends remain consistent across users from both datasets.\nThe accuracy of the trajectory points determines the radius of land usage data to consider. The e↵ect of accuracy on the number of extracted elements, both pre- and post-filtering, is shown in Figure 10 for each of the 40 MDC users. The figure demonstrates that a larger accuracy typically results in a larger number of elements per point, and that filtering reduces this number.\n2https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API — By default, the Overpass API is only capable of extracting elements that a coordinate pair is contained within if the element has been assigned a name. The API has therefore been modified to consider all enclosing elements in these cases."

The aim of filtering is to remove noise and focus the data on elements that the user was likely interacting with at a given time. It is reasonable therefore to assume that the elements post-filtering should have more similarity than those before, with less variation caused by the inclusion of random elements. To explore this hypothesis, Figure 11 shows the average tag key similarity (i.e. only the key part of the ‘key:value’ pair that makes up an element’s tags, which corresponds to broad type, e.g. ‘building’) both pre- and post-filtering for a given user over 1000 points of their data. This demonstrates that in the majority of cases, tag key similarity is increased, and variance significantly reduced, after filtering has occurred, indicating that the elements present post-filtering are more similar and that unrelated noise elements have been correctly removed. The semantic similarity of these tags is calculated using the method proposed in Section 5.2.1."

      "text" : "While there is no ground truth available for this type of problem, we can evaluate the procedure by considering desirable properties of the output for a specific application and manually compare the expected and actual results for small subsets of data. A major problem here is that when conducting such evaluations over publicly available research datasets, such as the MDC or GeoLife datasets used in this paper, or alternatives such as Yonsei, there is no mechanism for contacting users to have them verify assumptions. To overcome this problem, we opt to use data collected ourselves for this part of the evaluation, as it a↵ords us the ability to discuss with users exactly what activities they were conducting on a given day. Details of the data collected can be found in Section 6.1.\nThis section presents analyses on small amounts of manually labelled real-world data with the goal of using the constructed context trees to provide meaning to high-level behaviours, with the overall aim of identifying such behaviours from the tree. The data analysed spans 24 hours from the three users of the Warwick dataset, where annotations were added manually as accurately as possible, and in consultation with the users. The augmentation and filtering procedures were run over this data and, for each labelled time period, the 3 most common element tags were identified. This is shown in Figures 13-15. The aim here is not to label the time periods with the exact activity being performed, but rather to demonstrate that a meaningful relationship exists between the tags extracted and the true activity.\nIn Figure 13, general labels are applied to the activities being performed, and a meaningful correlation between the tags extracted by the procedure and these labels is evident. Specific examples include the action of driving being labelled with the ‘highway’ key, and taking the train with ‘railway’. Although the tags are not always perfect, they are indicative. For instance, when the individual was at home no residential building was identified, but an indication of the type of location was given by the tags ‘lit:yes’ and ‘highway’. In the region where this data was collected, roads with street lighting typically signify residential areas. A similar relationship is shown in Figures 14 and 15, with labels applied hierarchically and at lower granularities. While not every item is labelled exactly, we believe this is a result of the data collection method. We used a data collection rate of one point per minute, meaning that several labelled activities consist of only 1 or 2 trajectory points, leaving little information for the procedure to utilise. Similarly, the land usage dataset contains a vast amount of information, but can be limited in parts. An example of this is that the pub which was visited at 17:25 (Figure 14) is inside a larger building. The procedure is only capable of identifying that the building was occupied by the user, but there is no information pertaining to which element inside the building was being interacted with, and so the only available information is ‘building:yes’.\nTo quantitatively explore how well the procedure worked over these examples, each tag extracted is scored based on the relevancy to the label using three classifications: high, medium, low/none. These scores are manually assigned and shown in Table 1, where a high tag indicates that the label is very\nwell correlated to the activity (e.g. ‘building:residential’ to the activity ‘Home’), medium indicates that there is some link (e.g. ‘surface:asphalt’ to ‘Driving on a main road’), and low/none being given to tags with little or no relationship to the activity (e.g. ‘highway:bus stop’ to ‘Attending lecture’). Figure 16a shows the proportion of tags assigned to each of these weightings, demonstrating that the procedure identified tags with high or medium relevancy 69.7% of the time. We also consider the highest-ranked tag assigned to each labelled time period and the proportion of time periods represented by each tag score is shown in Figure 16b. From these results, it is clear that while in the three examples, only 32.8% of tags were awarded a high relevancy score, 60.0% of labels have at least one tag with such a score, and 88.9% contain at least one tag with a score of high or medium. This indicates that while not all of the 3 tags per label were useful, in nearly all cases, at least one of them was.\nWhile this evaluation is limited in that it only considers 3 days worth of data from 3 di↵erent users, it provides an indication that the techniques discussed previously are extracting useful and correct elements. This is demonstrated by showing that there is a strong relationship between the tags identified by the system and the labels manually assigned to data as a partial ground truth. A complete ground truth is not possible in this domain, since the desirable properties of context trees will vary significantly based on their intended use, however we believe that this exploration goes some way to demonstrating the accuracy of the technique."

      "heading" : "6.5 Context Trees",
      "text" : "When constructing context trees from summarised data (Section 5), the only required parameter is , which specifies the weighting to be given to semantic similarity as part of the Hybrid Contextual Distance distance metric (Equation 7). A weighting of 1 will construct a tree based only on the semantic similarity between node tags, and a weighting of 0 will construct a tree based only on the similarity of features, with any value in between using a combination of the two. The relationship between and the number of nodes in a context tree is shown in Figure 17 (generated using 24 hours of a single users’ data, filtered with parameters = 1200, t = 0.8, and tmax = 1200). While the number of nodes does not vary drastically with , the meaning behind the clusters does.\nSince our work on understanding context from trajectories augmented with land usage information is novel, there are no existing baseline methods or ground truth datasets to compare against. Instead, we take the closest method to a baseline that exists and compare the results against this. Figures 18 and 19 show the results of clustering context trees using näıve distance metrics that consider only geographic\ndistance between elements (Figure 18) and temporal distance between interactions (Figure 19). While these figures only show one small example, the results are representative of using such metrics in that the elements clustered together have no clear contextual relationship. This is in contrast to the context trees generated from the same data using the Hybrid Contextual Distance metric, along with di↵erent values of , as shown in Figures 20–22.\nIn all of these examples, the element identifier has been manually replaced with a descriptive keyword to represent the element. Semantic clustering (Figure 20) creates distinctive groups for buildings, footpaths and public amenities, as the elements in these groups are similar, while feature-based clustering (Figure 21) creates groups that are less easily identifiable and relate to properties of the elements (e.g. the footpaths are not grouped because they were not encountered in the same journey, but rather were used at di↵erent times of the day). Finally, hybrid clustering (Figure 22) shows properties of both semantic and feature-based clustering where both the description of the element and properties of the interaction with the element are considered to create clusters. Selecting an appropriate value of is application-specific.\nThese context trees provide only small examples of the di↵erences between trees generated with näıve distance metrics (Figures 18 and 19) and those generated with the HCD metric (Figures 20–22). In order to quantify such di↵erences, and given knowledge of the data and how it was collected, we opt to make several assumptions of expected properties of generated context trees and explore the extent to which these expectations are violated with each distance metric. While this is of course a subjective evaluation, and the utility will vary based on the specific application the context tree is put to, it goes some way to\nproviding an indicator of the utility of this approach in lieu of a ground truth. The assumptions made are:\n1. Buildings should be grouped together unless they have very di↵erent uses (e.g. residential buildings should not be in the same group as o ce buildings).\n2. Roads should be grouped together, with elements relating to roads grouped at a higher level (e.g. junctions).\n3. Public amenities should be grouped together unless the interactions have very di↵erent properties.\nThese assumptions focus on the semantics of elements, but the features also need to be considered when exploring possible reasons for clusters being split. For instance, if a person visited many houses as part of their job, it would be reasonable to assume that these houses should be semantically close to the residence of the individual in the context tree, but not at exactly the same level. The usefulness of such assumptions will depend on the application, but it is possible to see that when aiming to characterise how a person has spent their time, it is beneficial to identify the times spent at residential buildings separately to those spent at work. On the small example context trees shown in this section, geographic and temporal clustering (Figures 18 and 19) violate all 3 assumptions. Semantic clustering (Figure 20) best adheres to these assumptions, with the houses grouped at the same level and the building under construction close by in the next level up. Similarly, the footpaths are together with the cycle barrier, a related element, and highway one level up. Feature-based clustering (Figure 21) has fewer valid assumptions than semantic clustering, as it only considers the interactions with the elements and not the elements themselves. Although the houses are together in a single cluster, they are also joined with the car park and footpath. Finally, hybrid clustering (Figure 22) is very similar to semantic clustering with the exception that the highway is no longer situated close to the footpaths, but is further up the context tree by itself. This still leaves 2 of the assumptions strictly adhered to, with 1 very close. A change that can be explained by the consideration of interaction features, where the highway has a di↵erent profile of interaction than the footpath and cycle barrier elements. Again, these are small examples, however the trends present have been observed to be consistent across larger context trees.\nWith a better understanding of filtering, summarising and clustering, we turn our attention to exploring how data influences the properties of the generated context tree. Focusing on 21 days of data from a single user, Figure 23 shows repetition in data by using the first day as a set of training data and calculating the coverage (i.e. the proportion of test data present in the training data) for each following day, shown by the blue Fixed line. Additionally, the red Retrained line shows the coverage when using all previous days (i.e. 0 to n 1, where n is the current day) as the training set. The total number of nodes, number of leaf nodes, and total count of time periods for a context tree generated using the same data\n(where day n shows a summary for a tree built using all data from days 0 to n) are shown in Figure 24a. Please note that no data was recorded during day 5 for this sample user in the MDC dataset.\nFigure 23 begins with a low coverage for both Fixed and Retrained lines, indicating that few elements encountered in day 1 were present in the training set (day 0). However, while the Fixed score remains low for days 2–4, the Retrained score approaches 100%. In this instance, this is indicative of the user visiting elements that they did not encounter in the initial training day (day 0), but that they did encounter during subsequent days, as the Retrained line includes all previous days as training data. The figure shows similar results for the remaining test days, where during day 9 the user visited only locations visited during day 0 and during days 9, 11 and 16–20 the user encountered no new elements as the score for Retrained is at 100%. Figure 24a shows how these properties relate to the size of context trees generated. The number of leaf nodes is the number of unique elements and the number of time periods is a count of the total number of (non-unique) elements encountered. That is, if the user encountered the same element 3 times, or 3 di↵erent elements, both would count as 3 time periods. At day 1 the number of time periods is roughly the same as the number of leaf nodes, indicating that all elements were encountered approximately once. As time goes by, more elements are encountered, but a large number of existing elements are revisited, demonstrated by the disproportionate rise in the number of time periods. This indicates that over a short period, where the user likely remained within a single region, the size of the tree does not increase significantly as additional data is added. However, considering trees over larger time periods will not have the same property as the user will likely visit new regions with entirely new leaf nodes. Figure 24b shows a similar graph as Figure 24a, however it was generated using data from a user of the GeoLife dataset instead of the MDC dataset. As is evidenced by the figures, the procedure extracts similar trends in users from each dataset.\nThis section has characterised the outputs and properties of the context tree generation procedure presented in Section 3. While the concept of a ground truth for this work is not applicable, and existing approaches for comparison are lacking, through the provision of multiple small examples and a discussion of general trends we have demonstrated the applicability of the approach presented in this paper to the task of identifying similar contexts and storing such information in a hierarchical data structure."

Furthermore, reducing the size of context trees may have application-specific benefits, such as preventing overfitting when learning prediction models. In both of these cases, it is desirable to prune the tree to reduce the amount of data stored while maintaining as much information as possible.

To determine the cost of storing a cluster, it is important to understand how clusters are built up in a context tree (described in Section 5.1). When merging two clusters together to form a parent cluster, the aspects that belong to each cluster are considered in turn; specifically the tags, times and coordinate sets. Sets of tags are combined from the child clusters by taking their union, while times and coordinate sets are merged in such a way that overlapping components are combined into single elements, and thus through the combining of child clusters into a parent cluster, information has been removed. The cost of storing an additional node therefore is the cost of storing the individual components (e.g. time range) that are present in a child, but not present in the same form in its parent. Assuming uniform cost for each component:\nCost(C|P ) = ⇠ + |Ctimes \\ Ptimes| + |Ccoordsets \\ Pcoordsets| + | [s2Ccoordsets s \\ [s2Pcoordsetss| (8)\nWhere ⇠ > 0 is a small, manually selected, penalty that represents the overhead of storing each cluster, Ctimes is the set of time ranges that are associated with cluster C and Ccoordsets is the set of coordinate sets associated with cluster C. Remembering that the coordinate sets belonging to a cluster themselves contain sets of points (i.e. Ccoordsets = {{p1:1, p1:2, p1:3, ...}, {p2:1, p2:2, p2:3, ...}, ...}), [s2Ccoordsetss is taken to be the set of all points associated with any coordinate set that belongs to cluster C. Having ⇠ as non-zero represents that there is always a (small) cost associated with each cluster. Equation 8 will need tuning based on the specific application to better represent the true cost of storing a node, but it provides a basic foundation."

For this reason, any application of the approach will need to consider the goal of pruning and use this to inform the measurement of the utility a↵orded by a specific cluster. We adopt a general approach that can be tailored to specific needs by providing a measure of the information lost if the parent of a cluster were used to represent the child, similar in idea to the Kullback-Leibler divergence used to measure the di↵erence between probability distributions. As parents contain a superset of the children, we consider the utility of a child cluster (C) given its parent (P ) to be the proportion of information present in the\nparent that is not covered by the child, where the measure of information must consider the attributes (i.e. tags, times, and coordinate sets) present in each cluster:\nInformation(C ) = P t2Ctimes duration(t) + P s2Ccoordsets area(s) + |Ctags| (9)\nProviding even weighting to the di↵erent elements for the measure of utility:\nUtility(C|P ) = 1\n1\n3 P t2Ctimes duration(t)P t2Ptimes duration(t) + 1 3 P s2Ccoordsets area(s)P s2Pcoordsets area(s) + 1 3 |Ctags| |Ptags| !

From this figure it is possible to see that the number of nodes in a context tree can be drastically reduced while maintaining the majority of the information. Selecting ✓ = 0.6, the resultant pruned context tree contains approximately 20% of the nodes present in the unpruned tree, but maintains almost 70% of the useful information. While the process to prune the context tree adds in additional complexity, the resultant tree is considerably more\ncompact and thus applications that require storing or searching the tree will have significantly lower overhead.\nUsing the same data again, but this time holding ✓ = 0.2, Figure 27 shows the e↵ect of changing ⇠ on the number of unpruned nodes, average HCD and information. Increasing either ✓ or ⇠ reduces the number of nodes left after pruning (Figures 26a and 27a), as increasing ✓ specifies a higher threshold required to maintain a node, and increasing ⇠ assigns a higher cost to each node, making it less likely to exceed the threshold. The results also demonstrate that as more nodes are pruned from the context tree, the average distance of the remaining nodes becomes smaller (i.e. they become more similar, Figures 26b and 27b). Finally, Figures 26c and 27c demonstrate that although pruning does reduce the total information in the tree, it does so gradually until the number of unpruned nodes approaches 0, under the definition of information presented in Equation 9. This helps to demonstrate the e↵ectiveness of pruning as the number of nodes in the tree can be drastically reduced, but the amount of information remains high.\nFigure 28 shows how pruning a↵ects trees generated from real-world data (using the same data and clustering as in Figure 22). With the lowest value of ✓ (✓ = 0.25 shown in Figure 28b), only two leaf nodes have been pruned: one of the footpaths and one of the buildings. Increasing ✓ (✓ = 0.35 shown in Figure 28c) causes more leaf nodes to be pruned, and a further increase (✓ = 0.45 shown in Figure 28d) has the e↵ect of pruning entire sub-trees, resulting in a much smaller and more compact tree. Although containing less information, such pruned trees provide benefits in resource-constrained applications where storing and processing an entire tree may be infeasible."

      "text" : "This work has presented the context tree hierarchical data structure that summarises user contexts at multiple scales. In addition to this, we proposed a method for constructing context trees from geospatial trajectories and land usage datasets. The context tree is a novel data structure that provides rapid access to summary information about a user’s interactions with their environment, and thus provides a foundation for further analysis, understanding and modelling of the behaviours of individuals and groups.\nFurthermore, this work has presented an analysis of both context trees and the associated generation procedure, using real-world data and a partial ground truth, alongside a proposed method of pruning context trees to reduce their size, thus requiring less processing and memory for further applications. The data employed for evaluation came from the publicly available MDC [Kiukkonen et al., 2010; Laurila et al., 2012] and GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2008a, 2009, 2010] datasets, consisting of GPS trajectories from real individuals, in addition to data collected ourselves.\nConstructing context trees begins with processing of land usage data in a manner that considers both the extraction of relevant land usage information and filtering to remove noise, in addition to providing a novel technique for clustering related land usage elements to expose contexts by considering both properties of the real-world entities that the user interacted with, and properties of the interaction itself (e.g. the time and duration). These processes are combined with an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique to generate the context tree.\nBy summarising contexts into a single data structure, it becomes easier to detect changes in routine through anomaly identification, identify similarities and di↵erences between users to spot those with commonalities such as similar jobs or habits, and predict users’ future actions. These areas are proving to be increasingly important to the provision of tailored and useful services both on individual and societal scales. Future work will expand existing techniques applied to locations and contexts by increasing their applicability to context trees. For example, expanding location prediction to operate over contexts such as those identified through contextual clustering would provide the ability to predict not only where a user is likely to be going, but also properties of the interaction, such as when and for how long. Furthermore, predictions need not relate to specific locations or entities, but rather to contexts and thus it would become possible to predict that a user will go to, for example, a building with certain properties without the need to identify exactly which building will be the target."

Such patterns have also been considered as routines, where the aim is to extract features of a given day for classification (e.g. “left work at 5PM”) [Farrahi and Gatica-Perez, 2008, 2010]. Patterns, and extracted location transitions, have formed the basis of user similarity identification [Xiao et al., 2012], and travel companion identification [Tang et al., 2012]. Once expected patterns for a given user or group have been extracted, anomalous actions become possible to identify. Anomaly detection has been performed on geospatial trajectories, where isolation-based outlier detection has identified anomalous subtrajectories from vehicle tracking data [Chen et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011]. Similarly, statistical approaches have been shown to be useful in identifying trajectories that di↵er from an expected pattern [Laxhammar and Falkman, 2011, 2014; Rosen and Medvedev, 2012]. Raw geospatial trajectories have been used as the basis for many di↵erent tasks and applications. While assuming the availability of additional data at time of collection is often infeasible, augmenting trajectories after collection is possible and can enrich the knowledge a↵orded. Applications that consider such augmented trajectories include using map data to fill in missing periods of a trajectory [Zheng et al., 2012], and using map searches augmented with trajectories from the same user to enhance destination prediction [Wu et al., 2015].

Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour a↵orded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for pruning context trees, for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.",
