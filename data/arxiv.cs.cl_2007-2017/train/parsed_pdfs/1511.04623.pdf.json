These context-sensitive word representations are suitable for, e.g., distinguishing different word senses and other context-modulated variations in meaning. To learn the parameters of our model, we use cross-lingual supervision, hypothesizing that a good representation of a word in context will be one that is sufficient for selecting the correct translation into a second language. We evaluate the quality of our representations as features in three downstream tasks: prediction of semantic supersenses (which assign nouns and verbs into a few dozen semantic classes), low resource machine translation, and a lexical substitution task, and obtain state-of-the-art results on all of these."

      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Distributed representations of words, which represent each word as a vector in a low-dimensional space, can be learned from unannotated text corpora using a variety of techniques (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014; Landauer & Dumais, 1997). The value of such representations owes to their ability to capture intuitive notions of syntactic and semantic similarity as geometric locality. Despite their empirically proven value as a source of features in many downstream applications (Turian et al., 2010), the “one word type, one vector” assumption made by most word representation models is problematic because words may have multiple meanings.\nTwo standard solutions to this problem exist. The first to treat each word as a collection of discrete, mutually exclusive senses which are individually represented as vectors (Tian et al., 2014; Neelakantan et al., 2014; Wu & Giles, 2015; Huang et al., 2012; Jauhar et al., 2015). However, identifying the appropriate sense granularity in such models is difficult in practice and in theory (Kilgarriff, 1997; Erk et al., 2013). The second solution, which is the basis of this work, eschews sense inventories (whether latent or explicit) and says that lexical meaning is a function of word and its context (Erk & Padó, 2008; Kintsch, 2001; Mitchell & Lapata, 2008). While previous work has hinted at the promise of this solution, only a small number of hand-crafted word–context composition functions have been considered thus far in the literature on semantic representation learning. This is surprising given the success of learning composition functions for computing phrase and sentence representations (Socher et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014).\nThere are two central challenges faced by learning to represent words in context. The first is to identifying a suitable function class for the composition function. Such a function must be able to account for the fact that a single word type may have both several completely unreleated meanings as well as a several more or less distinct but still related meanings (Cruse, 2000). For an example of the former, the word plant may refer, depending on context, to a factory or to a living organism that photosynthesizes. For an example of the latter, the word bank may refer to a financial institution or the building housing a financial institution. Since bidirectional RNN-LSTMs have been shown to be able to learn both compositional (Bahdanau et al., 2014) as well as more arbitrary relationships (Ling et al., 2015), we use these as our composition function class (§2).\nThe second challenge is to identify an appropriate supervisory signal that will be used to fit the parameters of the function. Our motivating hypothesis—which follows a long line of work in using parallel data as a source of information about semantics (Bannard & Callison-Burch, 2005; Resnik & Yarowsky, 1999; Diab, 2003; Faruqui & Dyer, 2014; Hermann & Blunsom, 2014)—is that a good representation of a word in context will be one that predicts how that word (in its sentential context) translates into a second language (§3). We show that word-in-context representations can be learned efficiently from pairs of words-in-context and single word translations into a second language which are extracted from parallel corpora using a word alignment model.\nTo evaluate our proposed model and training criterion, we evaluate our learned representations as features in three tasks: supersense tagging, low-resource machine translation (i.e., translation where limited parallel data is available), and a lexical substitution task. Success in each of these requires models that can effectively capturing the meaning of a word in context, and in each, we show our model obtains state-of-the-art performance (§4). Additionally, the feedforward neural net model we use as a baseline for supersense tagging outperforms existing baselines even without our new word-in-context model."

      "text" : "Our model for contextual words is a bidirectional sequence model based on recurrent neural networks (Chan et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2014; 2015, inter alia). Intuitively, this model allows us to condition on arbitrarily long dependencies while having an implicit bias toward more local contexts.\nLet w = (w1, w2, . . . , wn) be the words in a sentence with length n. We also project all words into a fixed d-dimensional vectors x = (x1,x2, . . . ,xn), using a (one-word-per-type) word lookup table.\nThe model encodes each token of the sentence from left to right according to the standard Long-short term memory recurrences:\nit = σ(Wxixt +Whiht−1 +Wcict−1 + bi)\nft = σ(Wxfxt +Whfht−1 +Wcfct−1 + bf )\nct = ft ⊙ ct−1 + it ⊙ tanh(Wxcxt +Whcht−1 + bc)\not = σ(Wxoxt +Whoht−1 +Wcoct + bo)\nht = ot ⊙ tanh(ct)\nThis yields a representation −→ ht for each position in the sentence t which can be interpreted as the representation of word with its left context w1, w2, . . . , wt. The same process is repeated from right to left, yielding a vector ←− ht. The concatenation of these two vectors\nht = [ −→ ht; ←− ht],\nis our word-in-context representation."

To obtain a representation of a word in its context, we want to apply functions which mask or scale some dimensions of the vector according to its context. Thus, functions which apply same scaling function even the word and context are different, average and multi-layer perceptron for example, may not be suitable. The input gate in Long-short term memory is considered to be a suitable scaling function which take target word and its context (xt,ht, ct−1). Figure 1 show a simplified version of operation to modulate one sense (vegetable plant) from ambiguous type level vector with semantic mask which is conditioned on word and context."

      "heading" : "3 MEANING AND TRANSLATION",
      "text" : "We now require a training objective that provides supervision for learning the parameters of this model. The question we want to answer is: what is a suitable proxy (or “grounding”) for the mean-\nings of words in context that we can use to construct token-level (rather than type-level) word representations?\nTo illustrate the problem we wish to solve, consider the meaning of the token bank in the following sentences:\n• I went to the bank to deposit my paycheck.\n• I went to the river bank to eat some lunch.\nOne very productive strategy for learning semantic word embeddings is to rely on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), according to which semantically similar items occur in similar contexts. The distributional hypothesis is, furthermore, practically appealing since it enables semantics to be learned from large, unannotated text corpora.\nDespite the empirical success of the distributional hypothesis at obtaining representations of word types, creating a representation of word tokens in terms of context is conceptually unappealing since both the item being embedding and its context potentially share material. One possible solution would be an autoencoding objective, or one might also distinguish between “narrow” and “wide” context (i.e., one that determines the item being embedding and one that provides supervision).1\nHowever, we instead advocate using an alternative proxy for meaning: how words translate. Consider the two examples from above as they might be translated into French.\n• Je suis allé à la banque pour déposer mon chèque de paie.\n• Je suis allé sur la rive pour le déjeuner.\nThe homonymous (i.e., having two completely unrelated senses) word bank has been translated into two different words banque and rive in French.\nFinally, while not quite so copious as monolingual corpora, parallel data exist in convenient electronic form in abundance, and this provides a rich resource for learning about the semantics of natural language."

That is, we use the computed token embedding to define a probability estimate that a source language word et in context c = (e1, . . . , et−1, et+1 . . . , en) translates into a second language as f in vocabularyF . i.e., p(f | et, c).\n1For example, Mikolv et al. (2013) showed that short multiword expressions could be embedding by using the “wider” context that they occur in.\nThis is done by performing a softmax over the target vocabulary with the representation of the word ht, as defined in the previous section. That is, we compute\nu = Rht + b ′\np(f | et, c) = exp(uf )∑\nf ′∈F exp(uf ′) ,\nwhere parameters R and b′ define the projection of the source word with context representation ht onto the target vocabulary F .\nTo obtain pairs of words in context and their lexical translations into a second language, we use unsupervised word alignment techniques (Dyer et al., 2013), to obtain high precision word alignments from a parallel corpus. While modeling alignments as latent variables, or using a soft attention mechanism would be a reasonable alternative, word alignment is fast and the proposed training objective to be easily scaled to large corpora.\nFigure 2 illustrates the pre-training architecture.\nLexical Translation ( FR )"

We conducted experiments with the following four languages: French (FR), German (DE), Czech (CS), Finnish (FI) which are quite typologically diverse. Table1 shows the numbers of parallel sentences and the numbers of words. For each language pairs, we used 2000 sentences for development and the rest were used for training.\nAfter normal tokenization, we obtained alignments with fast-align tool (Dyer et al., 2013). Since we are modeling single word translations and want high-quality training instances, we run the alignment model in both directions and obtained symmetric alignments by taking intersection between forwards and backward alignments. To control the size of vocabulary, we took 30,000 most common words. For target languages, we removed 10 most common words. The words not in the vocabularies are replaced with 〈unk〉 token. We used sentences which have more than 10 words in a sentence.\nWe used 300 dimension embeddings for source language, and bi-directional LSTMs have 300 hidden units. The trained parameters are source embedding, weights and bias in the model.\nWe randomly initialized source word embeddings sampled from uniform distribution from −0.08 to 0.08. All recurrent materices with orthogonal initialization (Saxe et al., 2013), and non-recurrent weights are initialized from scaled uniform distribution (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Mini-batches of size 128 are used. We used Adam algorithm for optimization (Kingma & Ba, 2014). We trained models with early-stopping. The perplexities on development data for English to French, German, Czech and Finnish are 3.80, 6.49, 6.30, 19.25 respectively."

      "heading" : "4.2 SUPERSENSE TAGGING",
      "text" : "Supersenses can be thought of a generalization of words senses into a universal inventory of semantic types. That is, as the number of word senses tend to be too numerous for existing models to generalize properly with the small amounts of data available, supersenses address this problem by clustering all senses into a tractable set of tags. Table 4.2 show examples of supersense tags and its definition. As such, these are generally used in semantically oriented downstream tasks such as co-reference resolution (O’Connor & Heilman, 2013) and question answering (Pasca & Harabagiu, 2001).\nFollowing previous work, we trained our supersense tagger for nouns and verbs on the Semcor dataset. The Semcor datasets consists of three parts, brown1, brown2, and brownv. We mixed these three parts and trained supersense tagger on randomly split 4/5 of data and the rest were used as a development set. We evaluated our model on the held-out SensEval-3 all-words task (Mihalcea et al.,\n2004), as done in previous work on supersense tagging (Ciaramita & Altun, 2006; Yuret & Yatbaz, 2010). Since some tokens are annotated with two labels in ambiguous cases, we followed the heuristics of only using the first sense in the data as the correct synset/supersense (Ciaramita & Altun, 2006). To extract supersenses from the Semcor data, we used WordNet version 2.0 synsets.\nTo avoid the computational overhead of reading extremely wide contexts, we used sliding window to delimit the range of contexts as in (Collobert et al., 2011), that is, each token wt is embedded using a context window of words wt−n/2, . . . , wt, . . . , wt+n/2. The window size n was fixed to 20.\nWe use the pre-trained parameters and we put a new task specific softmax leyer on top of the hidden units (Fig.2). We updated all parameters including pre-trained parameters. The weights in the softmax layer were initialized from the scaled uniform distribution (Glorot & Bengio, 2010). Minibatches of size 128 were used with the Adam update rule (Kingma & Ba, 2014).\nSince this task has not previously been studied using neural networks, we also report several novel baselines: (1) multi-layer perceptron model which uses a concatenation of a source word type vector and the average of all word type vectors in its context; (2) a forward-only LSTM model; and (3) a bi-directional LSTM with random initialization (rather than cross-lingual pretraining). For fair comparison in terms of the size of word in context representation, we double the hidden unit size of the forward LSTM model."

The original task allow to make multiple predictions but we only predict only one substitution following (Melamud et al., 2015). This task is challenging, since it requires to find the best substitutes from entire word vocabulary.\nThe way to make prediction is the following. Given a target word and it’s context, we infer word in context representation of all possible substitutions. Then take one of the most similar words which have highest cosine similarity with target word in context vector as prediction.\nFor our experiments, we used a simple word alignment base candidate generation to reduce inference time. For a target word in English, we collect all possible French translations from word alignment and took English words 90% most frequently aligned to the French words as candidates. We used same candidates for all our experiments including baseline for fair comparison."

      "heading" : "7 RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "Word representation. Distributed word representations were successfully applied to several downstream tasks such as chunking, parsing, sentiment analysis and paraphrase detection. Most of the tasks requires to use not only word representation but representation of phrases or documents. In the previous works, many architectures were proposed to learn and use word representation. In the sequence modeling problems such as BIO chunking, conditional random fields and recurrent neural networks are applied to represent a sequence of word representations (Turian et al., 2010; Mesnil et al., 2013). For classification tasks such as document classification, sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, summation of word embeddings (Lauly et al., 2014), convolutional neural networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) and recursive networks (Socher et al., 2013; Cheng & Kartsaklis, 2015) were proposed to represent compositionality function of words.\nLearning semantics from parallel data. Previous works show methods to improve word or document level representation by incorporating multilingual context. Faruqui & Dyer (2014) proposed canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based method to improve the quality of type level representation by projecting word representations of translation pairs (obtained by automatic word alignments) to be maximally correlated in common vector space. Hermann & Blunsom (2013) propose compositional vector space model (CVM) to build sentence representation. They represent a sentence as the sum of its word representations and they train word representation by constraining the representations of parallel sentences to be close. Coulmance et al. (2015) shows that predicting context in target language is an effective way to train word representation shared across languages. Hill et al. (2014) investigated the quality of word embedding learned by neural machine translation model and show its benefit on tasks that require modeling word similarity.\nCompositional vector models. Most prior work on compositional vector models has looked primarily at the problem of computing representations of complete phrases rather than specifically words in context. Furthermore, one can learn reasonable generalizations from models that condition on and the generate text using an autoencoding objective (Socher et al., 2011). Dhillon et al. (2012) make the intriguing proposition that left- and right- contexts can be used to supervise each other."

To learn the parameters of our model, we use cross-lingual supervision, hypothesizing that a good representation of a word in context will be one that is sufficient for selecting the correct translation into a second language. We evaluate the quality of our representations as features in three downstream tasks: prediction of semantic supersenses (which assign nouns and verbs into a few dozen semantic classes), low resource machine translation, and a lexical substitution task, and obtain state-of-the-art results on all of these.",
