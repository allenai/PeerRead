      "text" : "In the context of contemporary monophonic music, expression can be seen as the difference between a musical performance and its symbolic representation, i.e. a musical score. In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are almost as popular as the human performed ones.\nIntroduction\nHuman performances of written music differ in many aspects from a straight acoustical rendering a computer would make. Besides the fact that we would not be even able to play music like a machine, a human performer would give its own interpretation to a musical score, by changing the timing, the loudness, the duration, and the timbre of each note, or even by removing or adding notes (in jazz for example). In fact, a human listener can easily recognize a human performance from a straight computer rendering, without necessarily being a musician. Nevertheless, there is no straightforward mathematical formulation of what is or is not musically expressive.\nMusical expression is a fundamental component of music. It can translate the intention of the composer via the indications written on the score, in order to help the performer. These indications can be whether associated to a specific note, or a group of notes (dynamical indications, articulations, ...) or a word corresponding to a specific style, or a specific phrasing (e.g. fast swing, ballad, groovy, ...). In the latter case, one can legitimately expect to find non-trivial correlations between some well choosen observables, reflecting the specific musical style, and it is the aim of this paper.\nFor this purpose we will use a MaxEnt model which belongs to the wide class of probabilistic graphical models, built to capture and mimic both unary and pairwise correlations between variables. MaxEnt models have already been used in music1 in order to study melodic patterns. Unlike in Markov chains in which the sampling complexity grows exponentially with the size of the patterns, MaxEnt models consistent with pairwise correlations keep this complexity quadratic, independently from the distance between the correlated variables. Importantly, we will use a translation-invariant model for simplicity, i.e we will consider that the probability distribution of a variable associated to a particular note depends only on the variables associated to the neighbouring notes, independently from its intrinsic position in the melody. This assumption is equivalent to saying that musical expression consists in local texture, rather than long-range correlations.\nLike in other aspects of music such as harmony or rhythm, musical expression has a complex underlying structure, that have been tried to be captured by statistical models, or learning algorithm (see2, 3 on romantic music). Working with expression differs from symbolic music computing, in the fact that it involves continuous variables like loudness, or local tempo modulation that cannot be mathematically treated as categories (like the pitch, for example). Unlike romantic music in which a performer usually continuously modulate the tempo, contemporary western music like jazz, or pop music is often played with a rhythmic section that tend to maintain a constant tempo along the melody. The rhythmic expression is thus contained in the difference between: i: the onset of the performed note and its onset on the score, and ii: the duration of the performed note and its duration on the score. In the following, we will refer to these observables as microtiming deviations.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n03 60\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nO ct\n2 01\n6"

      "text" : "The Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME)4 states that given a set of observations, the probability distribution that best model the data is the one that maximizes the entropy. The observations are expressed in terms of averages, or expected values, of one or more quantities. This principle has applications in many domains, such as information theory, biology, statistics, and many more, but comes from statistical physics in which it aimed at connecting macroscopic properties of physical systems to a microscopic description at the atomic or molecular level.\nGiven a set of observables Fj = 〈 f j(x)〉|P(x), 1≤ j ≤ Nc on a quantity x, in which 〈〉|P(x) represents the expectation value over the probability distribution P(x), the PME allows us to determine the distribution P(x) of maximum entropy, fulfilling the constraints.\nThe variables we need our model to deal with are:\n• metrical position in the bar (discrete)\n• onset deviation (continuous)\n• duration deviation (continuous)\n• loudness (continuous).\nHence, the PME should be applied for each of these variables, and to carefully treat separately continuous variables that will be denoted by y, from discrete ones denoted by x. z will refer to an arbitrary variable, belonging to one or the other of the previous types of variable..\nDiscrete Variables If x is a discrete variable, taking values in an alphabet {xi}1≤i≤Q then the maximum entropy probability distribution P(xi) = Pr(x = xi) reads:\nP(xi) = 1\nZ (λ1, ...,λNc) exp\n( ∑\nj λ j f j(xi)\n) (1)\nwhere\nZ (λ1, ...,λNc) = Q\n∑ i=1 exp\n( ∑\nj λ j f j(xi)\n) . (2)\nContinuous Variables On the other hand, if y is a real valued variable, one can show that the probability density function p(y) reads\np(y) = 1\nZ (λ1, ...,λNc) exp\n( ∑\nj λ j f j(y)\n) (3)\nwhere\nZ (λ1, ...,λNc) = ∫\np(y)>0 exp\n( ∑\nj λ j f j(y)\n) dy. (4)\nIn both cases, Z (λ1, ...,λNc) is called partition function and consists in a normalization constant. We consider now a sequence of N notes, each of which carrying Ncont continuous variables(loudness, microtiming deviations) and Ndisc discrete Xvdisc(n)|1≤n≤N variables (metrical position in the bar). Transversally, we can see the same sequence as Nvoices = Ncont +Ndisc sequences of N elements, all of them being whether discrete or continuous numbers. In this view, we will talk about a superposition of voices (the horizontal blue rectangles on Fig. 1), whereas notes are represented vertically (vertical red rectangles).\nLet us denote Yv and Xv respectively a continuous and a discrete variable belonging to the v-th voice, and Yv(n) and Xv(n) respectively their values at the n-th note. For each voice v, there is a MaxEnt model given by the probability distribution of central variable Zv(n), conditionned on the values of the neighbouring variables. We define the neighbourhood ∂Zv(n) of a variable Zv of the n-th note by itself, the variables surrounding Zv(n) on the same voice (Zv(n± k) with 1≤ k ≤ Khormax),\n2/12\nthe variables on the same vertical line (Zv′(n) with v′ 6= v), and the variables diagonally connected to it (Zv′(n± k) with 1≤ k ≤ Kdiagmax ). For example, the neighbourhood of a variable is represented on Figure 2, with Khormax = 3 and K diag max = 1. The expression of the MaxEnt probability (or probability density, for continuous variables) distribution can be then written as follows:\nPv(Zv|∂Zv) = 1\nZ (∂Zv) exp(−Hv(Zv,∂Zv)) (5)\nH (Zv,∂Zv) = hv(Zv)+ ∑ Z′∈∂Zv JZ,Z′ (6)\nwhere z correspond to the value of variable Z. In the previous expressions 5 and 6,, the JZ,Z′’s are called the couplings (or interaction energy) between two variables Z and Z′, and the hv’s the local fields (or bias). Importantly we consider here only symmetric couplings JZ,Z′ = JZ′,Z . This terminology comes from statistical physics in which a hamiltonian H (Zv(n),∂Zv(n)) represents an energy associated to a specific configuration of Zv(n) and ∂Zv(n). Depending on the nature of the concerned variables Z and Z′, JZ,Z′ can whether be a real number, a vector or a matrix.\nPr(Xv(n) = xi|∂Xv(n)) = Pi(Xv(n)|∂Xv(n)) = 1\nZ (∂Xv(n)) exp\n( −hv(xi)− ∑\nZ∈∂Xv(n) JXv,Z(xi,z)\n) (7)\nPr(y < Yv(n)< y+dy|∂Yv(n)) = pv(y|∂yv(n))dy = 1\nZ (∂Yv(n)) exp\n( −hv y− ∑\nZ∈∂Yv(n) JXv,Z(y,z)\n) dy (8)\nImportantly, due to the choice of observables we made, the self-interaction term JY,Y for continuous variables Y is proportional to y2, taking into account the standard deviation 16, while it is zero for integer variables JX ,X = 0. The rest of the couplings to the concerned continuous variable Y contribute to a linear term (proportional to y). Consequently, the conditional probability density pv(y|∂yv(n)) is always a gaussian."

      "text" : "As mentionned in the introduction, we chose to focus on a translation-invariant model for simplicity, i.e., for each voice, the elementary module carrying the parameters of the model, represented on figure 2, is translated horizontally for every note of the voice. Every possible position of the graph on the sequence, gives rise to a sample to be used in the inference of the parameters.\n3/12\nPseudo log-likelihood We use a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the model parameters, i.e., we want to optimize the parameters of a model Pv such that the probability to generate the dataset Dv associated to the voice v using Pv is maximal. The pseudo log-likelihood approximation,5, 6 consists in substituting the probability of the whole sequence z = {Zv(n)}1≤n≤N by the product of the conditional probabilities of each sample sv = {sv(m)}1≤m≤M where M = N−2max(Khormax,K diag max ) is the number of samples of the sequence, conditionned on the values of the neighbouring variables. The resulting negative pseudo log-likelihood associated to voice v, Lv reads:\nLv({Jv},hv|Dv) =− 1 M\nM\n∑ m=1 logPv(zmv |∂ zmv ) (9)\nSince all the couplings are symmetric, the vertical and the diagonal ones are involved in two different models, corresponding to the two different voices. The determination of the Nvoices models are then entangled and cannot be done sequentially, which lead us to minimize the sum of the negative log-likelihoods over all the voices, consistently with the pseudo log-likelihood approximation.\nL ({{Jv},hv}1≤v≤Nvoices |D) = ∑ v Lv({Jv},hv|Dv) (10)\nwhere D represents the whole dataset ⋃ v Dv. The minimization of L in ?? does not generally imply the minimization of the individual Lv, however it gives a good approximation of it while the dataset possesses an overall consistency.6\nThe Corpus The corpus consists in a series of midi melodies recorded twice1 by a professional piano player, with a click at a selected tempo and a very neutral accompaniement (chords played on the downbeats). We chose about 172 tunes from the LeadSheet DataBase7 divided in 5 sub-corpora so to have a balance of expression styles, namely swing, latin, ballad, pop, and groove. The full list of tunes can be found in appendix 3.2. For each tune, the pianist was asked to play the melody freely, without removing any note nor adding any extra note. Of course, being familiar with almost all the tunes, he respected their musical context, and their style conventions: swing phrasing for swing, etc ...\nThe dataset is formed as follows: the first voice corresponds to the rhythmic score: it is described by the metrical position of a note in its bar, which is encoded in an integer. The normalized midi onset deviation δo, the normalized midi duration deviation δd, and the reduced midi velocity δv (loudness) were then measured for each note, and constitute the continuous voices :\nδo = onsetperf−onsetscore\ndurationscore (11)\nδd = durationperf−durationscore\ndurationscore (12)\nδv = velocityperf\n127 (13)\nEach sub-corpus was used to train a style model."

Then, the following step is repeated: randomly select a variable, compute its probability conditioned by its neighbours, given by eq. (7) and eq. (8), and draw a new value from this probability distribution. A stationnary regime is reached after a number of Monte Carlo steps of the order of a few times the number of variables nvar (in practice ≈ 10nvar)."

On figure 3, one can see the a good agreement for high frequencies (more or less ≥ 10−2), meaning that patterns sufficiently represented in the\n1one for the training, the other for the validation tests.\n4/12\ncorpus are well captured by the model. In our example we took Khormax = 3 and K diag max = 1, and trained the model on the swing sub-corpus. These values are a good compromise between too many parameters, and a good efficiency in capturing correlations. Two quantities can be computed along the generation process, in order to monitor the level of convergence of the sequence: The negative log-likelihood, and the distance between the generated sequence correlations, and the corpus’ correlations. As we can see on fig. 4, both quantities decrease macroscopically before stabilizing to a stationnary regime, made of typical sequences. We used the same test sequence and the same model (swing) in order to exhibit the convergence properties of the Metropolis procedure.\nFor each musical style, similar features are observed. A more instructive character of our models is its ability to predict the value of a variable in a sequence that has been played by our performer. This is the role of the test corpus.\nmax = 1.\nPredictive power: We can perform a leave-one-out cross-validation and obtain good results. Let us remind that the coefficient of determination R2 measures the predictive power as follows: R2 ∈ [0,1], 0 representing no improved prediction with respect to an empirical gaussian random variable, 1 representing a perfect prediction.\nGenerally speaking, the onset deviation seems to be better modeled, whereas the loudness gets worse results than the other observables. Note as well that the swing model has, a better predictive power for any observable, than any other model. We will enter into more details in the discussion section 3."

      "heading" : "2.2 Perceptive validation",
      "text" : "In the previous section, we have shown different mathematical criteria which provide the validation of the structure and the implementation of the MaxEnt models for musical expression. To be consistent with our goal, it is necessary to perform a perceptive validation, and this is how we proceeded:\n5/12\nProtocol: We set up a pairwise comparison test of 4 different versions of a melody: our baseline version called “straight” (with zero microtiming deviations and a constant loudness), a version played by the professional performer (called “human”), a version generated by our models (called “MaxEnt”) and a control version, called “random”, where microtiming deviations and loudness were sampled with an empirical gaussian distribution2. Every participant was asked to listen to two different versions of the melody for each of the 6 tunes we picked. The pair of versions were randomly picked so that after an important number of participations, every version had been compared to every other version the same number of times. The participants were then asked to answer two questions:\n• What version did you prefer ?\n• What version did you find more expressive ?\nFor equity purposes, all four versions were rendered with the same method, and with the same average loudness value. The random and MaxEnt versions were generated with a constrained Metropolis algorithm,i.e. performing the Metropolis algorithm in which the voice concerning the rhythmic score is fixed to the score’s. Furthermore, the accompaniement was rendered with another soundfont, so it could not be confused with the melody. Finally, a participant could do the test only once.\nThe following table shows the melodies we choose, with the associated MaxEnt model:\nA wide communication was done in order to have as many people as possible do the test. We did not aim at selecting any specific category of people. The website hosting the test has been active for 6 weeks during which it collected 244 participations. The musical samples are available at http://ns2292021.ovh.net:3000/.\nIntepretation of the results: In order to give a general ranking over the four versions, we used a so called Bradley-Terry model9, 10 which infers potential βi for each version i consistent with a probabilistic model giving the probability that version i “beats” version j (i > j) :\nP(i > j) = eβi\neβi + eβ j (14)\nDenoting ni, j the number of votes i > j, we use P(i > j) = ni, j\nni, j+n j,i as input of the inference algorithm, we impose the\npotential associated to the straight version to be zero. The results are plotted on figure 7. Note that any set of values of P(i > j) does not necessarily lead to a fully ordered set of β . In the four cases shown on figure 7, the algorithm convergences very quickly, ensuring that the votes are very well fitted by the Bradley-Terry model. The overall trend puts the human performance in the first position question-wise. The MaxEnt melodies are secondlyprefered, with an significant margin with respect to the other versions. This is particularly the case for the swing, in which there are some strongly defined phrasing codes: delaying the onset and stressing every even eighth of a bar (upbeats), and increasing the duration of every odd eighth of a bar (downbeats). This pattern is very typical, easy to capture by our MaxEnt model, and strongly recognizable by a human ear. On the other hand, expressive phrasing in ballads or a bossa nova tunes is much less stereotyped, and have an important versatiliy, observed in the data. In particular for slow tempo melodies, a slightly too stressed, or slightly too delayed or anticipated note can sound very artificial. It is very likely that the latter reason explains the important differences between the swing results, with the overall trend.\nTo the question “which melody to you find more expressive?”, we observe a different tendency: There is a clear domination of the human performance and a clear inferiority of the straight version. In between, both generated versions get comparable scores. It can be explained by the fact that the extreme versions are very recognizable, and neither random nor MaxEnt models\n2The same distribution corresponding to zero cross validation coefficient of determination in the previous section\n6/12\nsuccess in generating “as much expressivity” as the one perceived in a human performance. In the title of the question, the notion of “more expressive” is confusing, and can be understood as ”which version differs the most from the straight melody?”. In this sense, the results are consistent with the constructions of the versions, but not very instructive from a perceptive point of view."

      "text" : "We proposed a Maximum Entropy model which captures pairwise correlations between rhythmic score, micro timing and dynamics observables in musical sequences. The model is used to generate new expression sequences that mimic the interpretation of a musician, given musical style. The structure of this model (see Fig. 2) leads to the replication of complex patterns, despite the pairwise nature of the information used. The pairwise correlations have Moreover, our model deals with both continuous and categorical variables, remaining in the context of Maximum Entropy models.\nWe performed two different validation processes, quantitative and perceptive, whose conclusions are consistent: MaxEnt models success to capture the local texture of different expression styles. The results are very satisfying in particular for a stereotyped style like swing, whereas they are encouraging for more complex styles, like ballad, or latin jazz.\nOne of the most challenging perspective is to allow a model of expression to add or remove notes. This model would be very meaningful in from a musical point of view, but would also cost us a deep modification of the modelization. One should also take into account harmony and pitches, keeping a tractable sample complexity thanks to the MaxEnt model.\nAppendices"

In this paper, we show how Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models can be used to generate musical expression in order to mimic a human performance. As a training corpus, we had a professional pianist play about 150 melodies of jazz, pop, and latin jazz. The results show a good predictive power, validating the choice of our model. Additionally, we set up a listening test whose results reveal that on average, people significantly prefer the melodies generated by the MaxEnt model than the ones without any expression, or with fully random expression. Furthermore, in some cases, MaxEnt melodies are almost as popular as the human performed ones.",
