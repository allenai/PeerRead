      "text" : "Learning word vector representations using monolingual distributional information is now a ubiquitous technique in NLP. The quality of these word vectors can be significantly improved by incorporating cross-lingual distributional information (Klementiev et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2013; Vulić and Moens, 2013b; Mikolov et al., 2013b; Faruqui and Dyer, 2014; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Lauly et al., 2014, inter alia), with improvements observed both on mono-lingual (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014; Rastogi et al., 2015) and crosslingual tasks (Guo et al., 2015; Søgaard et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016).\nSeveral models for inducing cross-lingual embeddings have been proposed, each requiring a different form of cross-lingual supervision – some can use document-level alignments (Vulić and Moens, 2015), others need alignments at the sentence (Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Gouws et al.,\n2015) or word (Faruqui and Dyer, 2014; Gouws and Søgaard, 2015) level, while some require both sentence and word alignments (Luong et al., 2015). However, a systematic and extensive comparison of these models is missing from the literature, making it difficult to analyse which approach is suitable for a particular NLP task. In this paper, we fill this void by empirically comparing four cross-lingual word embedding models each of which require different form of alignment(s) as supervision, across several dimensions. To this end, we train these models on four different language pairs, and evaluate them on both mono-lingual and cross-lingual tasks. We will release our comparison setup and trained embeddings upon publication.\nFirst, we show that different models can be viewed as instances of a more general framework for inducing bilingual word embeddings. Then, we evaluate these models on both extrinsic and intrinsic tasks. Our intrinsic evaluation assesses the quality of the vectors on mono-lingual (§4.2) and cross-lingual (§4.3) word similarity tasks, while our extrinsic evaluation spans semantic (crosslingual document classification (§4.4)) and syntactic (cross-lingual dependency parsing (§4.5)) tasks.\nOur experiments show that word vectors trained using expensive cross-lingual supervision (word alignments or sentence alignments) perform the best on semantic tasks. On the other hand, for syntactic tasks like cross-lingual dependency parsing, models requiring weaker form of cross-lingual supervision (such as context agnostic translation dictionary) are competitive to models requiring expensive supervision. We also analyze the embeddings qualitatively with the aim of revealing latent regularities in the vector space which explain why some models do better than others.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 42\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nA pr\n2 01\n6\nAlgorithm 1 General Algorithm 1: Initialize W←W0,V← V0 2: (W∗,V∗)← argminαA(W) + βB(V) +C(W,V)\nFigure 1: (Above) A general schema for induction of crosslingual word vector representations, when provided with bilingual supervision for a language pair.

All models were trained using a window size of 10 (tuned over {5, 10, 20}), and 30 negative samples (tuned over {10, 20, 30}). The cross-lingual weight was set to 4 (tuned over {1, 2, 4, 8}). The word alignments for training the model (available at github.com/lmthang/ bivec) were generated using cdec (Dyer et al., 2010). The number of training iterations was set to 5 (no tuning).\nBiCVM. We use the tool (available at github. com/karlmoritz/bicvm) released by Hermann and Blunsom (2014) to train all embeddings. We train an additive model (that is, f(~x) = g(~x) = ∑ i xi) with hinge loss margin set to 200 (no tuning), batch size of 50 (tuned over 50, 100, 1000) and noise parameter of 10 (tuned over {10, 20, 30}). All models are trained for 100 iterations (no tuning).\nBiCCA. First, mono-lingual word vectors are trained using the skip-gram model5 with negative sampling (Mikolov et al., 2013a) with window of size 5 (tuned over {5, 10, 20}). To generate a bilingual dictionary, word alignments are generated using cdec from the parallel corpus. Then, word pairs (a, b), a ∈ l1, b ∈ l2 are selected such that a is aligned to b the most number of times and vice versa. This way, we obtained dictionaries of approximately 36k, 35k, 30k and 28k word pairs for en-de, en-fr, en-sv and en-zh respectively.\nThe mono-lingual vectors are aligned using the above dictionaries with the tool (available at github.com/mfaruqui/eacl14-_cca) released by Faruqui and Dyer (2014) to generate the bilingual word embeddings. We use k = 0.5 as the number of canonical components (tuned over {0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0}). Note that this results in a embedding of size 100 after performing CCA.\nBiVCD. We use word2vec’s skip gram model for training our embeddings, with a window size\n5code.google.com/p/word2vec\nof 5 (tuned on {5, 10, 20, 30}) and negative sampling parameter set to 5 (tuned on {5, 10, 25}).

We implemented the code for performing the merging as we could not find a tool provided by the authors."

      "text" : "We first evaluate if the inclusion of cross-lingual knowledge using bilingual models improves the quality of English embeddings.\nWord Similarity. Word similarity datasets contain word pairs which are assigned similarity ratings by humans. The task evaluates how well the notion of word similarity according to humans is emulated in the vector space. Evaluation is based on the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (Myers and Well, 1995) between human rankings and rankings produced by computing cosine similarity between the vectors of two words.\nWe use SimLex dataset for English (Hill et al., 2014) which contains 999 pairs of English words, with a balanced set of noun, adjective and verb pairs. SimLex is claimed to capture word similarity exclusively instead of WordSim-353 (Finkelstein et al., 2001) which captures both word similairty and relatedness. We declare significant improvement if p < 0.1 according to Steiger’s method (Steiger, 1980) for calculating the statistical significant differences between two dependent correlation coefficients.\nTable 2 shows performance of English embeddings induced by all the models by training on different language pairs on the SimLex word similarity task. Overall, across all language pairs, BiCVM is the best performing model in terms of spearman’s correlation, but its improvement over BiSkip and BiVCD is often insignificant. It is notable that 2 of the 3 top performing models, BiCVM and BiVCD, need sentence aligned and document-aligned corpus only, which are easier to obtain than parallel data with word alignments required by BiSkip.\nQVEC. Tsvetkov et al. (2015) proposed an intrinsic evaluation metric for estimating the quality of English word vectors. The score produced by QVEC measures how well a given set of word vectors is able to quantify linguistic properties of words, with higher being better. The metric is shown to have strong correlation with per-\nformance on downstream semantic applications. As it can be only used for English, we use it to evaluate the English vectors obtained using crosslingual training of different models. Table 3 shows that on average across language pairs, BiSkip achieves the best score, followed by BiVCD and BiCCA. Interestingly, BiCVM which was the best model according to SimLex, ranks last overall according to QVEC. The fact that the best models according to QVEC and word similarities are different reinforces the observation of Tsvetkov et al. (2015) that performance on word similarity tasks alone does not reflect quantification of linguistic properties of words."

We follow the setup of Vulić and Moens (2013a), but instead of manually creating a gold bilingual dictionary, we derived our gold dictionaries using the Open Multilingual Wordnet data released by Bond and Foster (2013). The data includes synset alignments across 26 languages with over 90% accuracy. First, we prune out words from each synset whose frequency count is less than 1000 in the vocabulary of the training data from §3. Then, for\neach pair of aligned synsets s1 = {k1, k2, · · ·} s2 = {g1, g2, · · ·}, we include all elements from the set {(k, g) | k ∈ s1, g ∈ s2} into the gold dictionary, where k and g are the lemmas. Using this approach we generated dictionaries of sizes 1.5k, 1.4k, 1.0k and 1.6k pairs for en-fr, en-de, en-sv and en-zh respectively.6\nWe report top-10 accuracy, which is the fraction of the entries (e, f) in the gold dictionary, for which f belongs to the list of top-10 neighbours of the word vector of e, according to the induced bilingual embeddings. From the results (Table 4), it can be seen that for dictionary induction, the performance improves with the quality of supervision. As we move from cheaply supervised methods (eg. BiVCD) to more expensive supervision (eg. BiSkip), the accuracy improves. This suggests that for cross lingual similarity tasks, the more expensive the cross-lingual knowledge available, the better. Models using weak supervision like BiVCD perform poorly in comparison to models like BiSkip and BiCVM, with performance gaps upwards of 10 pts on an average."

We use the RCV2 Reuters multilingual corpus7 for our experiments. In this task, for a language pair (l1, l2), a document classifier is trained using the document representations derived from word embeddings in language l1, and then the trained model is tested on documents from language l2 (and vice-versa). By using supervised training data in one language and evaluating without further supervision in another, CLDC assesses whether the learned multilingual representations are semantically coherent across multiple languages.\n6We will release these dictionaries. 7http://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/\nreuters.html\nAll embeddings are learned on the data described in §3, and we only use the RCV2 data to learn document classification models. Following previous work, we compute document representation by taking the tf-idf8 weighted average of vectors of the words present in it. A multi-class classifier is trained using an averaged perceptron (Freund and Schapire, 1999) for 10 iterations, using the document vectors of language l1 as features9. Majority baselines for en → l2 and l1 → en are 49.7% and 46.7% respectively, for all languages. Table 5 shows the performance of different models across different language pairs. We computed confidence values using the McNemar test (McNemar, 1947) and declare significant improvement if p < 0.05.\nFrom Table 5, it is evident that in almost all the cases, BiSkip performs significantly better than the remaining models. For transferring semantic knowledge across languages via embeddings, sentence and word level alignment proves superior to sentence or word level alignment alone. This observation is consistent with the trend in crosslingual dictionary induction, where too the most expensive form of supervision performed the best."

The idea behind direct-transfer is to train a dependency parsing model using embeddings for language l1 and\n8tf-idf was computed using all documents for that language in RCV2\n9We use the implementation of Klementiev et al. (2012)\nthen test the trained model on language l2, replacing embeddings for language l1 with those of l2. The transfer relies on coherence of the embeddings across languages arising from the cross lingual training. For our experiments, we use the cross lingual transfer setup of Guo et al. (2015).10 Their framework trains a transition-based dependency parser using nonlinear activation function, with the source-side embeddings as lexical features. These embeddings can be replaced by target-side embeddings at test time.\nAll models are trained for 5000 iterations with fixed word embeddings during training. Since our goal is to determine the utility of word embeddings in dependency parsing, we turn off other features that can capture distributional information like brown clusters, which were originally used in Guo et al. (2015). We use the universal dependency treebank (McDonald et al., 2013) version2.0 for our evaluation. For Chinese, we use the treebank released as part of the CoNLL-X shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).\nWe first evaluate how useful the word embeddings are in cross-lingual model transfer of dependency parsers (Table 6). On an average, BiCCA does better than other models. BiSkip is a close second, with an average performance gap of less than 1 point. BiSkip outperforms BiCVM on German and French (over 2 point improvement), owing to word alignment information BiSkip’s model uses during training. It is not surprising that English-Chinese transfer scores are low, due to the significant difference in syntactic structure of the two languages. Surprisingly, unlike the semantic tasks considered earlier, the models with expensive supervision requirements like BiSkip and BiCVM could not outperform a cheaply supervised BiCCA.\nWe also evaluate whether using bilingually trained vectors for learning dependency parsers is better than using mono-lingually trained vectors in Table 7. We compare against parsing models trained using mono-lingually trained word vectors (column marked Mono in Table 7). These vectors are the same mono-lingual used as input to the BiCCA model. All other settings remain the same. On an average across language pairs, improvement over the mono-lingual embeddings was obtained with the BiSkip and BiCCA models, while BiCVM and BiVCD consistently performed worse. A possible reason for this is that BiCVM\n10 github.com/jiangfeng1124/acl15-_ clnndep\nand BiVCD operate on sentence level contexts to learn the embeddings, which only captures the semantic meaning of the sentences and ignores the internal syntactic structure. As a result, embedding trained using BiCVM and BiVCD are not informative for syntactic tasks. On the other hand, BiSkip and BiCCA both utilize the word alignment information to train their embeddings and thus do better in capturing some notion of syntax."

Our choice of models was motivated to compare different forms of supervision, and therefore, adding these models, would not provide additional insight.\nOur experiments reveal several interesting trends. When evaluating on intrinsic tasks such as mono-lingual word similarity, models (such as BiVCD) relying on cheaper forms of supervision perform almost on par (no statistically significant difference) with models requiring expensive supervision. On the other hand, for cross-lingual semantic tasks, like CLDC and dictionary induction, the model with the most informative supervision performs best overall. In contrast, for the syntactic task of dependency parsing, cheaply supervised models perform slightly better. It appears that for cross-lingual transfer of syntactic knowledge, word level alignment alone can suffice."

We perform an extensive evaluation of four popular approaches of inducing cross-lingual embeddings, each requiring a different form of supervision, on four typographically different language pairs. Our evaluation setup spans four different tasks, including intrinsic evaluation on mono-lingual and cross-lingual similarity, and extrinsic evaluation on downstream semantic and syntactic applications. We show that models which require expensive cross-lingual knowledge almost always perform better, but cheaply supervised models often prove competitive on certain tasks.",
