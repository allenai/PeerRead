      "text" : "Large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), such as Freebase [Bollacker et al., 2008], WordNet [Miller, 1995], Yago [Suchanek et al., 2007], and NELL [Carlson et al., 2010], are critical to natural language processing applications, e.g., question answering [Dong et al., 2015], relation extraction [Riedel et al., 2013], and language modeling [Ahn et al., 2016]. These KBs generally contain billions of facts, and each fact is organized into a triple base format (head entity, relation, tail entity), abbreviated as (h,r,t). However, the coverage of such KBs is still far from complete compared with real-world knowledge [Dong et al., 2014]. Traditional KB completion approaches, such as Markov logic networks [Richardson and Domingos, 2006], suffer from feature sparsity and low efficiency. Recently, encoding the entire knowledge base into a lowdimensional vector space to learn latent representations of entity and relation has attracted widespread attention. These knowledge embedding models yield better performance in\nterms of low complexity and high scalability compared with previous works. Among these methods, TransE [Bordes et al., 2013] is a classical neural-based model, which assumes that each relation can be regarded as a translation from head to tail and uses a score function S(h,r,t)=‖h+ r − t‖ to measure the plausibility for triples. TransH [Wang et al., 2014] and TransR [Lin et al., 2015b] are representative variants of TransE. These variants consider entities from multiple aspects and various relations on different aspects.\nHowever, the majority of these approaches only exploit direct links that connect head and tail entities to predict potential relations between entities. These approaches do not explore the fact that relation paths, which are denoted as the sequences of relations, i.e., p=(r1, r2, . . ., rm), play an important role in knowledge base completion. For example, the sequence of triples (J.K. Rowling, CreatedRole, Harry Potter), (Harry Potter, Describedin, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone) can be used to infer the new fact (J.K. Rowling, WroteBook, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone), which does not appear in the original KBs. Consequently, a promising new research direction is to use relation paths to learn knowledge embeddings [Neelakantan et al., 2015; Guu et al., 2015; Toutanova et al., 2016].\nFor a relation path, consistent semantics is a semantic interpretation via composition of the meaning of the component elements. Each relation path contains its respective consistent semantics. However, the consistent semantics expressed by some relation paths p is unreliable for reasoning new facts of that entity pair [Lin et al., 2015a]. For instance, there is a common relation path h HasChildren −−−−−−−−−→ t′ GraduatedFrom −−−−−−−−−−−→ t, but this path is meaningless for inferring additional relationships between h and t. Therefore, reliable relation paths are urgently needed. Moreover, their consistent semantics, which is essential for knowledge representation learning, is consistent with the semantics of relation r. Based on this intuition, we propose a compositional learning model of relation path embedding (RPE), which extends the projection and type constraints of the specific relation to the specific path. As the path ranking algorithm (PRA) [Lao et al., 2011] suggests, relation paths that end in many possible tail entities are more likely to be unreliable for the entity pair. Reliable relation paths can thus be filtered using PRA. Figure 1 illustrates the basic idea for relation-specific and path-specific projections. Each entity is projected byMr andMp into the corresponding\nrelation and path spaces. These different embedding spaces hold the following hypothesis: in the relation-specific space, relation r is regarded as a translation from head hr to tail tr; likewise, p∗, the path representation by the composition of relation embeddings, is regarded as a translation from head hp to tail tp in the path-specific space. We design two types of compositions to dynamically construct the path-specific projection Mp without extra parameters. Moreover, with slight changes on negative sampling, we also propose that relationspecific and path-specific type constraints can be seamlessly incorporated into our model. Our main contributions are as follows: 1) To reinforce the reasoning ability of knowledge embedding models, the consistent semantics and the path spaces are introduced. 2) The path-specific type constraints generated from path space can help to improve the model’s discriminability. 3) Compared with the pure data-driven mechanism in the knowledge embeddingmodels used, the way in which we utilize PRA to find reliable relation paths improves the knowledge representation learning interpretability. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We first provide a brief review of related knowledge embedding models in Section 2. The details of RPE are introduced in Section 3. The experiments and analysis are reported in Section 4. Conclusions and directions for future work are reported in the final section."

      "text" : "We first concentrate on three classical translation-based models that only consider direct links between entities. The bold lowercase letter v denotes a column vector, and the bold uppercase letter M denotes a matrix. The first translationbased model is TransE, and it defines the score function as S(h,r,t)=‖h + r − t‖ for each triple (h,r,t). The score will become smaller if the triple (h,r,t) is correct; otherwise, the score will become higher. The embeddings are\nlearned by optimizing a global margin-loss function. This assumption is clearly simple and cannot address more complex relation attributes well, i.e., 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-toN. To alleviate this problem, TransH projects entities into a relation-dependent hyperplane by the normal vector wr: hh=h-w T r hwr and th=t-w T r twr (restrict ‖wr‖2=1). The corresponding score function is S(h,r,t)=‖hh + r − th‖. TransE and TransH achieve translations on the same embedding space, whereas TransR assumes that each relation should be used to project entities into different relation-specific embedding spaces since different relations may place emphasis on different entity aspects. The projected entity vectors are hr=Mrh and tr=Mrt; thus, the new score function is defined as S(h,r,t)=‖hr + r− tr‖.\nAnother research direction focuses on improving the prediction performance by using prior knowledge in the form of relation-specific type constraints [Krompass et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015]. Note that each relation should possess Domain and Range fields to indicate the subject and object types, respectively. For example, the relation haschildren’s Domain and Range types both belong to a person. By exploiting these limited rules, the harmful influence of a merely data-driven pattern can be avoided. Typeconstrained TransE [Krompass et al., 2015] imposes these constraints on the global margin-loss function to better distinguish similar embeddings in latent space.\nA third current related work is PTransE [Lin et al., 2015a] and the path ranking algorithm (PRA) [Lao et al., 2011]. PTransE considers relation paths as translations between head and tail entities and primarily addresses two problems: 1) exploit a variant of PRA to select reliable relation paths, and 2) explore three path representations by compositions of relation embeddings. PRA, as one of the most promising research innovations for knowledge base completion, has also attracted considerable attention [Lao et al., 2015; Gardner and Mitchell, 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Nickel et al., 2016]. PRA uses the path-constrained random walk probabilities as path features to train linear classifiers for different relations. In large-scale KBs, relation paths have great significance for enhancing the reasoning ability for more complicated situations. However, none of the aforementioned models take full advantage of the consistent semantics of relation paths."

      "text" : "The consistent semantics expressed by reliable relation paths has a significant impact on learning meaningful embeddings. Here, we propose a compositional learning model of relation path embedding (RPE), which includes novel path-specific projection and type constraints. All entities constitute the entity set ζ, and all relations constitute the relation set R. RPE uses PRA to select reliable relation paths. Precisely, for a triple (h,r,t), Pall={p1,p2,. . .,pk} is the path set for the entity pair (h,t). PRA calculates P(t|h, pi), the probability of reaching t from h following the sequence of relations indicated by pi, which can be recursively defined as follows:\nIf pi is an empty path,\nP (t|h, pi) =\n{\n1 if h = t 0 otherwise (1)\nIf pi is not an empty path, then p ′ i is defined as r1,. . .,rm−1; subsequently,\nP (t|h, pi) = ∑\nt′∈Ran(p′i)\nP (t′|h, p′i) · P (t|t ′, rm) (2)\nRan(p′i) is the set of ending nodes of p ′ i.

      "text" : "The key idea of RPE is that the consistent semantics of reliable relation paths is similar to the semantics of the relation between an entity pair. For a triple (h,r,t), RPE exploits projection matrices Mr, Mp ∈ R\nm×n to project entity vectors h, t ∈ Rn in entity space into the corresponding relation and path spaces simultaneously (m is the dimension of relation embeddings, n is the dimension of entity embeddings, and m may differ from n). The projected vectors (hr, hp, tr, tp) in their respective embedding spaces are denoted as follows:\nhr = Mrh, hp = Mph (3)\ntr = Mrt, tp = Mpt (4)\nBecause relation paths are those sequences of relations p=(r1, r2, . . ., rm), we dynamically use Mr to construct Mp to decrease the model complexity. Subsequently, we explore two compositions for the formation of Mp, which are formulated as follows:\nMp =Mr1 +Mr2 + . . .+Mrm (addition composition)\n(5)\nMp =Mr1 ×Mr2 × . . .×Mrm (multiplication composition)\n(6)\nwhere addition composition (ACOM) and multiplication composition (MCOM) represent cumulative addition and multiplication for path projection. Matrix normalization is applied on Mp for both compositions. The new score function is defined as follows:\nG(h,r,t) = S(h,r,t) + λ · S(h,p,t) = ‖hr + r− tr‖+\nλ\nZ\n∑\npi∈Pfilter\nP (t|h, pi) · Pr(r|pi) · ‖hp + p ∗ i − tp‖ (7)\nFor path representation p∗, we use p∗=r1+r2+. . . +rm, as suggested by PTransE. λ is the hyper-parameter used to balance the knowledge embedding score S(h,r,t) and the relation path embedding score S(h,p,t). Z= ∑\npi∈pfilter P(t|h, pi) is the nor-\nmalization factor, and Pr(r|pi) = Pr(r, pi) / Pr(pi) is used to assist in calculating the reliability of relation paths. In the experiments, we increase the limitation on these embeddings, i.e., ‖h‖2 6 1, ‖t‖2 6 1, ‖r‖2 6 1, ‖hr‖2 6 1, ‖tr‖2 6 1, ‖hp‖2 6 1, and ‖tp‖2 6 1. By exploiting the consistent semantics of reliable relation paths, RPE embeds entities into the relation and path spaces simultaneously. This method improves the flexibility of RPE when modeling more complicated relation attributes."

      "heading" : "3.2 Path-specific Type Constraints",
      "text" : "In RPE, based on the semantic similarity between relations and reliable relation paths, we can naturally extend the relation-specific type constraints to novel path-specific type constraints. In type-constrained TransE, the distribution of corrupted triples is a uniform distribution. In our model, we borrow the idea from TransH, incorporating the two type constraints with a Bernoulli distribution. For each relation r, we denote the Domainr and Ranger to indicate the subject and object types of relation r. ζDomainr is the entity set whose entities conform to Domainr, and ζRanger is the entity set whose entities conform to Ranger. We calculate the average numbers of tail entities for each head entity, named teh, and the average numbers of head entities for each tail entity, named het. The Bernoulli distribution with parameter teh\nteh+het for each relation r is incorporated with the two type constraints, which can be defined as follows: RPE samples entities from ζDomainr to replace the head entity with probability teh teh+het , and it samples entities from ζRanger to replace the tail entity with probability het teh+het . The objective function for RPE is defined as follows:\nL = ∑\n(h,r,t)∈C\n[ L(h, r, t) + λ\nZ\n∑\npi∈Pfilter\nP (t|h, pi)·\nPr(r|pi)L(h, pi, t) ]\n(8)\nL(h,r,t) is the loss function for triples, and L(h,pi,t) is the loss function for relation paths.\nL(h, r, t) = ∑\n(h′,r,t′)∈C′′\nmax(0, S(h, r, t) + γ1−\nS(h′, r, t′))\n(9)\nL(h, pi, t) = ∑\n(h′,r,t′)∈C′′\nmax(0, S(h, pi, t) + γ2−\nS(h′, pi, t ′))\n(10)\nWe denoteC={(hi,ri,ti) | i=1,2. . .,t} as the set of all observed triples and C′={(h′i,ri,ti) ∪ (hi,ri,t ′\ni) | i=1,2. . .,t} as the set of corrupted triples, where each element of C′ is obtained by randomly sampling from ζ. C′′, whose element conforms to the two type constraints with a Bernoulli distribution, is a subset of C′. The Max(0, x) returns the maximum between 0 and x. γ is the hyper-parameter of margin, which separates corrected triples and corrupted triples. By exploiting these two prior knowledges, RPE could better distinguish similar embeddings in different embedding spaces, thus allowing it to achieve better prediction."

      "heading" : "3.3 Training Details",
      "text" : "We adopt stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the objective function. TransE or RPE (initial) can be exploited for the initializations of all entities and relations. The score function of RPE (initial) is as follows:\nG(h,r,t) = S(h,r,t) + λ · S(h,p,t) = ‖h+ r− t‖+\nλ\nZ\n∑\npi∈Pfilter\nP (t|h, pi) · Pr(r|pi) · ‖h+ p ∗ i − t‖ (11)\nWe also employ this score function in our experiment as a baseline. The projection matrices Ms are initialized as identity matrices. RPE holds the local closed-world assumption (LCWA) [Dong et al., 2014], where each relation’s domain and range types are based on the instance level. Their type information is provided by KBs or the entities shown in observed triples.\nNote that each relation r has the reverse relation r−1; therefore, to increase supplemental path information, RPE utilizes the reverse relation paths. For example, for the relation path LeBron James PlayFor −−−−−−→ Cleveland Cavaliers BelongTo −−−−−−→ NBA, its reverse relation path can be defined as NBA BelongTo−1 −−−−−−−−→ Cleveland Cavaliers PlayFor−1\n−−−−−−−→ LeBron James.\nFor each iteration, we randomly sample a correct triple (h,r,t) with its reverse (t,r−1,h), and the final score function of our model is defined as follows:\nF (h,r,t) = G(h,r,t) +G(t,r−1,h) (12)\nTheoretically, we can arbitrarily set the length of the relation path, but in the implementation, we prefer to take a smaller value to reduce the time required to enumerate all relation paths. Moreover, as suggested by the path-constrained random walk probability P(t|h, p), as the path length increases, P(t|h, p) will become smaller and the relation path will more likely be cast off."

WordNet is a large lexical knowledge base of English, in which each entity is a synset that expresses a distinct concept, and each relationship is a conceptual-semantic or lexical relation. We use two subsets of Freebase, FB15K and FB13 [Bordes et al., 2013], and one subset of WordNet, WN11 [Socher et al., 2013]. Table 1 presents the statistics of the datasets, where each column represents the numbers of entity type, relation type and triples that have been split into training, validation and test sets.\nIn our model, each triple has its own reverse triple for increasing the reverse relation paths. Therefore, the total number of triples is twice the number used in the original datasets. Our model exploits the LCWA. In this case, we utilize the type information provided by [Xie et al., 2016] for FB15K.

The final step is to rank the original correct entity with these scores in descending order. Two evaluation metrics are reported: the average rank of correct entities (Mean Rank) and the proportion of correct entities ranked in the top 10 (Hits@10). Note that if a corrupted triple already exists in the knowledge base, then it should not be considered to be incorrect. We prefer to remove these corrupted triples from our dataset, and call this setting ”Filter”. If these corrupted triples are reserved, then we call this setting ”Raw”. In both settings, if the latent representations of entity and relation are better, then a lower mean rank and a higher Hits@10 should be achieved. Because we use the same dataset, the baseline results reported in [Lin et al., 2015b; Lin et al., 2015a; Ji et al., 2016] are directly used for comparison."

The numbers in bold are the best performance, and n-hop indicates the path length n that PTransE exploits. We denote RPE only with path-specific constraints as RPE (PC), and from the results, we can observe the following. 1) Our models significantly outperform the classical knowledge embedding models (TransE, TransH, TransR, and TranSparse) and PTransE on FB15K with the metrics of mean rank and Hits@10 (filter). The results demonstrate that the path-specific projection can explore further implications on relation paths, which are crucial for knowledge base completion. 2) RPE (PC) improves slightly compared with the baselines. We believe that this result is primarily because RPE (PC) only focuses on local information provided by related embeddings, ignoring some global information compared with the approach of randomly selecting corrupted entities. In terms of mean rank, RPE (ACOM) achieves the best performance with 14.5% and 24.1% error reduction compared with PTransE’s performance in the raw and filter settings, respectively. In terms of Hits@10, RPE (ACOM) brings few improvements. RPE with path-specific type constraints and projection (RPE (PC + ACOM) and RPE (PC +MCOM)) is a compromise between RPE (PC) and RPE (ACOM).\nTable 3 presents the separated evaluation results by mapping properties of relations on FB15K. Mapping properties of relations follows the same rules in [Bordes et al., 2013], and the metrics are Hits@10 on head and tail entities. From Table 3, we can conclude that 1) RPE (ACOM) outperforms all baselines in all mapping properties of relations. In particular, for the 1-to-N, N-to-1, and N-to-N types of relations\nthat plague knowledge embeddingmodels, RPE (ACOM) improves 4.1%, 4.6%, and 4.9% on head entity’s prediction and 6.9%, 7.0%, and 5.1% on tail entity’s prediction compared with previous state-of-the-art performances achieved by PTransE (ADD, 2-hop). 2) RPE (MCOM) does not perform as well as RPE (ACOM), and we believe that this result is because RPE’s path representation is not consistent with RPE (MCOM)’s composition of projections. Although RPE (PC) improves little compared with PTransE, we will indicate the effectiveness of relation-specific and pathspecific type constraints in triple classification. 3) We use the relation-specific projection to construct path-specific ones dynamically; then, entities are encoded into relation-specific and path-specific spaces simultaneously.

In addition, most of the existing methods for knowledge base completion only consider the direct links between entities, ignoring the vital impact of the consistent semantics of relation paths. In this paper, we study the problem of how to better embed entities and relations of knowledge bases into different low-dimensional spaces by taking full advantage of the additional semantics of relation paths, and we propose a compositional learning model of relation path embedding (RPE). Specifically, with the corresponding relation and path projections, RPE can simultaneously embed each entity into two types of latent spaces. It is also proposed that type constraints could be extended from traditional relation-specific constraints to the new proposed path-specific constraints. The results of experiments show that the proposed model achieves significant and consistent improvements compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms.",
