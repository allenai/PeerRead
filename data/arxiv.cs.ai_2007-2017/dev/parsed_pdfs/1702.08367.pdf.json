      "text" : "A large body of work in AI and machine learning has considered the problem of learning models composed of sets of first-order logical rules, such as the rule: for all a,b,c,\nAthletePlaysForTeam(a, b) ∧ TeamPlaysInLeague(b, c) =⇒ AthletePlaysInLeague(a,c)\nThis problem is often called inductive logic programming (ILP) (Muggleton et al., 1992) or statistical relational learning (SRL) (Getoor, 2007) and typically the underlying logic is a probabilistic logic, such as Markov Logic Networks (Richardson & Domingos, 2006) or ProPPR (Wang et al., 2013). Learned models composed of probabilistic logical rules are useful for a number of tasks, including\n1School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

An overview of the model: a memory-augmented recurrent neural network acts as a controller that learns to compose primitive logic operators. At each step, the controller “softly” chooses operators and inputs from memory. The operators correspond to one-hop reasoning in the knowledge base.\nknowledge base completion (Lao et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015b). Unfortunately the learning problem is quite difficult, since determining the structure of the theory (i.e., the particular sets of rules included) is a discrete optimization problem, and one that involves search over a potentially large space of alternatives. Most past learning systems have thus used local-search based optimization methods that interleave moves in a discrete space with moves in parameter space (Kok & Domingos, 2007; Lao & Cohen, 2010; Wang et al., 2014).\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative approach: a completely differentiable model for learning models defined by sets of first-order rules. The approach is inspired by a differentiable logic called TensorLog (Cohen, 2016), a subset of first-order logic for which inference tasks for can be compiled into sequences of differentiable numerical operations on matrices. TensorLog, however, assumes that a human programmer chooses the set of logical rules, and then uses gradient-based learning methods to optimize parameters (which represent confidences for facts and rules): in other words, it includes no mechanism for structure search.\nIn this paper, we describe a neural controller system (Neelakantan et al., 2015; Andreas et al., 2016) which learns how to sequentially compose the primitive operations used\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n08 36\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 7\nFe b\n20 17\nby TensorLog. The space of programs which can be learned by this controller system includes the space of TensorLog programs, but the controller is fully differentiable, and can be learned end-to-end with gradient methods. In outline, our system includes (1) a memory, which holds vectors holding a distribution of potential bindings for logical variables, (2) a neural controller, which is recurrent neural network that takes actions based on the current hidden state, and (3) a set of operations, analogous to the operations used in TensorLog, which perform “primitive logical inference steps”. Each operation takes as input one or more previously-bound memory cells, and populates a new memory cell. At each stage of the computation, the controller uses an attention mechanism to pick an operation to perform and inputs to the operation, performs the operation, and finally updates its hidden state.\nWe conduct experiments on four knowledge base completion tasks of varying scale. Our differentiable rule learning method outperforms a strong iterated structure gradient (Wang et al., 2014) baseline.\nThe long-term goal of this work is to develop integrated, end-to-end systems that can both perform compositional, logical reasoning, as well as lower-level perception tasks. A differentiable rule learning method is a step toward integration of these two types of learning. While the end result is less interpretable than an explicit set of logical rules, the input and output of the can be interpreted as hidden states or probability distributions for “upstream” or “downstream” modules.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we introduce the knowledge base completion task in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe in detail the aforementioned TensorLog operators and how to learn rules differentiably. In the Section 4, we compare our method with a strong discrete rule learning baseline on four knowledge bases. Lastly in Section 5, we draw the connections among our methods and other rule learning models."

      "text" : "Knowledge bases (KB) are sets of facts about real-world entities (such as people, places, and things). The facts in the knowledge base are usually stored in RDF format, i.e. each fact is a triple of the format (head, relation, tail), or equivalently relation(head, tail). For example, a fact Father(Tom, Amy) means that Tom is the father of Amy. Modern knowledge bases such as Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) contains millions of entities and billions of facts. Such large amount of structured data has promising applications in many problems, such as information retrieval, natural language understanding, and biological data mining.\nKnowledge bases are usually incomplete. There are facts about the entities not included in the database. Hence an important task regarding knowledge base is to automatically discover the missing facts, i.e. knowledge base completion. In some scenarios, the missing facts can be inferred by reasoning from the existing facts. This is based on the assumptions that structure in knowledge bases provides sufficient information. We adopt this assumption and proposes a rule learning method that leverages the structure among relations.\nRepresentation based knowledge base completion methods rely on learning embeddings for entities (Socher et al., 2013). This entity-dependent memorization approach is not as inductively generalizable as our method. Our rule learning method is capable of entity-independent reasoning, a feature that is absent in representation based methods."

RA1 , . . . , RAn , and RC are relations in the knowledge base, and y1, . . . , yn, x, z are entities.

Thus, we associate each rule with a real number α ∈ (0, 1) as its confidence. The rules now become\nRA1(y1, x) ∧ · · · ∧RAn(z, yn) =⇒ RC(z, x), 0.9 (2)\nDuring inference, we will compute the confidence of RC(z, x) by adding the confidences of all the rules that imply it."

      "heading" : "3.1. TensorLog representation of KB and logic rule inference",
      "text" : "In order to make rule learning differentiable, we first introduce a matrix representation of the knowledge base and logic rule inference, as used in TensorLog (Cohen, 2016). In this representation, entities are numerically encoded. We represent each entity e with a one hot vector ve ∈ {0, 1}N , where N is the number of entities, and only the e-th component is 1. For each relation C in the KB, we use a matrix\nMC ∈ {0, 1}N×N to store all the facts about this relation. Then entry MCi,j is 1 if and only if RC(i, j) is a fact in the knowledge base.\nUsing this matrix representation, we can imitate the rule inference RA(y, x)∧RB(z, y) =⇒ RC(z, x) for all y by computing\nuz,B,A,x . = vTzM BMAvx. (3)\nIn the context of this paper, the TensorLog operators indeed refer to multiplying with matrixMR for some relation R. Figure 2 shows a graph-based equivalent view of applying TensorLog operators. In other words, each TensorLog operators (i.e. multiplications with certain matrices) allow the model to perform one-hop reasoning in the knowledge base.\nIt is straightforward from the representation definition that\n|{y | RA(y, x) ∧RB(z, y) holds }| = uz,B,A,x (4)\nIn other words, given z and x, the number of y’s that satisfy RA(y, x) ∧ RB(z, y) is equal to the matrix product vTzM BMAvx.\nSince RA(y, x) and RB(z, y) together implies RC(z, x), It is natural to assume that the more such y’s, the more likely RC(z, x) holds. Thus, we will use u . = MBMAvx to represent the confidence, denoted C(·), over entities {z} such that RC(z, x) holds. Mathematically, this means\nui = |{y | RA(y, x) ∧RB(zi, y)}| ∝ C[RC(zi, x) holds] (5)\nAs we mentioned before, there could be multiple rules that imply RC , each with different confidences. Let these rules be\nRAl(y, x) ∧RBl(z, y) =⇒ RC(z, x) (6)\nLet the confidence of these rules be αl, where l = 1, . . . , L. Therefore, the confidence of RC(zi, x) is\nC[RC(·, x) holds] ∝ ∑ l αlM BlMAlvx (7)\nThough we have described the rules in terms of length two, it is straightforward to generalize to cases where rule lengths varies, resulting the following mathematical formulation,\nC[RC(·, x) holds] ∝ ∑ l αl ∏ j∈βl M jvx (8)\nwhere βl contains the indices of relations in rule l. It is worth pointing out that matrix multiplication is not commutative in this scenario, and we must multiply the relation matrices in the particular order specified by the rules."

      "heading" : "3.2. Learning the logic rules",
      "text" : "We will now discuss the rule learning process, including learnable parameters and model architecture. As shown in Equation 8, for each query RC(·, x), we need to learn the set of rules that imply it and the confidences associated with these rules. Since these parameters are dependent on the query relation, we augment the notation with raising indices to make this explicit. The learnable parameters of our model is {αCl , βCl }, for each relation C.\nHowever, it is difficult to formulate a differentiable process to directly learn the parameters {αCl , βCl } (Lao & Cohen, 2010). This is because each parameter is associated with a particular rule, and enumerating rules is an inherently discrete task. To overcome this difficulty, we observe that an almost equivalent way to write Equation 8 is to interchange the summation and product, resulting the following\nformula with different parameterization,\nT∏ t K∑ k aktM kvx (9)\nwhere T is the max length of rules and K is the number of relations in the knowledge base. The key parameterization difference between Equation 8 and Equation 9 is that in the latter we associate each relation in the rule with a weight. This combines the rule enumeration and confidence assignment.\nHowever, there is a problem with Equation 9 that it assumes all rules are of the same length. This issue can be solved by using a similar but recurrent formulation\nu0 = vx, ut = t−1∑ τ btτuτ , ut+1 = K∑ k aktM kut (10)\nEquation 10 can represent rules of different lengths because of the memory vectors ut. The memory vector allows the model to append relations to any partially enumerated rules, hence the various rule lengths.\nGiven the formulation in Equation 10, the learnable parameters for each relation RC becomes {akt , btτ} for t = 1, . . . , T and k = 1, . . .K. We use a memory-augmented Long short-term memory network (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997; Weston et al., 2014; Graves et al., 2016), denoted controller, to model this recurrent process. The number of unroll steps in the controller is the maximum length of the logic rules that we want to learn. The controller mechanism is the following:\nht, ct = update(ht−1, ct−1, inputt) (11) at = softmax(Wht + b) (12)\nbt = softmax([h1, . . . , ht−1]Tht) (13)\nThe ht and ct are hidden states of the controller. The inputt is a continuous representation of the relation RC . The controller predicts relation weights akt based on the relation and previous hidden states. The weights btτ on previous memory are based on comparing current hidden states with all previous hidden states.\nThe objective function is to minimize the negative cross entropy between normalized uT , denote uT and vz for all z that RC(z, x) holds but are not available in the knowledge base.\nLoss = − (uT log vz + (1− uT log(1− vz)) (14)\nThe loss function in Equation 14 indeed represents our goal of using logic rules for knowledge base completion. It aims to learn logic rules that when executed return the same result as if directly infer the relation RC .\nWe can naturally extend the model to include entities information in the knowledge base. The idea is to use the entity to control how much information flow from the hidden state ht to the relation weights at by adding a gate on the hidden states (Dhingra et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016). Mathematically, this means\nht = ht sigmoid(W1f(x) +W2ht−1 + b′) (15)\nwhere f(x) is a continuous representation of the entity x. This will make the learned logic rules not only relation dependent, but also entity dependent, which can be considered as adding a condition term in the logic rules, such as\nIf entity is x, then RA(y, x) ∧RB(z, y) =⇒ RC(z, x) (16)"

This embedding matrix is randomly initialized.\nThe hidden states size and query continuous representation size are both 128.

      "heading" : "5.1. Inductive logic programming",
      "text" : "A number of approaches have been explored to perform a data-driven search for for logical theories. Except in trivial cases, this problem is intractable (Cohen & Page, 1995), so heuristics are usually used to search this discrete space. For example, the FOIL system (Quinlan, 1990; Quinlan & Cameron-Jones, 1993) uses decision-tree like information gain measures to guide a greedy search, in which rules are constructed by incrementally adding conditions to an empty rule body, and theories are constructed by incrementally adding rules to an empty theory. Similar heuristics have been applied to search for zeroth-order (propositional\nrule sets) (e.g., (Cohen, 1995)). Other discrete search methods used to search for logical theories include searches that exploit special operators, such as finding the least general generalization of two candidate rules (Muggleton et al., 1990) or inverse entailment (Muggleton, 1995). While these techniques are often successful they do not exploit the power of modern gradient-based optimization methods, and are not well-suited to use in integrated, end-to-end systems that can combine logical reasoning with neural approaches for lower-level tasks.\nIn order to model statistically complex data, more recent approaches to learning logical theories adopt probabilistic logics, rather than standard logics. For instance, Kok and Domingos (Kok & Domingos, 2005) describe a system which interleaves parameter optimization of weights for Markov Logic Network (MLN) rules and beam search to find the structure of a MLN (Richardson & Domingos, 2006). These approaches are robust but computationally expensive in practice, especially since for many probabilistic logics, parameter optimization (and often inference) is expensive.\nAlternatively, search can be made more efficient by restricting the space of logical rules. For instance, the Path Ranking Algorithm (PRA) (Lao et al., 2011) first enumerates a subset of all possible rules, consisting of chain rules of limited length. Using these rules, the algorithm assigns features to each pair of entities, based on a confidence score derived from a random-walk semantics for the rule. Finally, it trains a classifier using these features that classifies relations between entities, using L1-regularization to eliminate unnecessary rules. Our method is broadly similar to PRA: in particular, we also consider chain rules (in these experiments) and associate weights with rules. However, our method jointly enumerates rules and assigns weights in an end-to-end differentiable manner.\nPRA has since been extended in several ways, for instance, by adopting “softer paths” (Gardner et al., 2014) based on vector space similarity. One extension is the logic ProPPR (Wang et al., 2015a), which generalizes the paths of PRA to a full logic, which extends stochastic logic programs (Muggleton et al., 1996). ProPPR has also been combined with Iterative Structural Gradient (ISG), a variant of a structure learning method based on use of meta-interpreters (Muggleton & Lin, 2013). Briefly, a ProPPR meta-interpreter is constructed which behaves like a theory which contains a large number of rules—in particular, every rule which can be generated by a set of rule templates—such that the parameters of this “template theory” correspond to specific instantiations of a rule. By computing a gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters, it is possible to identify rule instantiations which would reduce loss. These are added to the meta-interpreter as special cases, and the\nprocess is repeated. After several iterations of rule introduction based on “structural gradient”, weights are learned for the learned rules using ordinary parameter learning (by gradient descent.) Though ISG is a fairly scalable and general method, this approach still requires discrete moves through structure space, and hence it is not clear how to integrate with other perception tasks in an end-to-end differentiable fashion. ISG is used in the experiments of Section 4 as our strong baseline, and the experiments suggest a substantial improvement in performance on most datasets."

For instance, the Neural Programmer (Neelakantan et al., 2015; 2016) is a similar neural controller model that uses an attention mechanism to “softly” choose which actions to take at each step. Our method differs from Neural Programmer in several details, but notably in the choice of operators. The goal of Neural Programmer is to parse natural language utterances into sequences of actions, and hence each of its action is an independent task, such as table lookup or summation. In contrast, we select operations (such as sparse matrix multiplication) and a database encoding such that operations, properly sequenced, can be used to implement logical reasoning.\nThe operators we use are based on operations used internally in TensorLog (Cohen, 2016), a recently developed deductive database, for which the reasoning process is differentiable. While we adopt the same data representation and operators of TensorLog, one key difference between our method and TensorLog that TensorLog assumes given the logic programs, it then performs inference using the logic programs. In contrast, in our method, we aim to learn the structure of the logic program.\nThe Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) is a more general model and is capable of modeling more complex programs than our method.

A common approach in knowledge-base embedding models is to learn representations of relations (denoted WR) and entities (denoted ve) such that for some measurement function f , the value f(ve1 ,WR, ve2) is maximized for all R(e1, e2) facts. To infer whether some fact R′(e1, e2) holds, we can compute and if necessary threshold the value f(ve1 ,WR′ , ve2). Unfortunately, embedding methods will always fail to infer R′(ê, e2) if ê is a entity not seen in training, because the representation of the new entity vê is unavailable to the model.\nRule learning approaches model the structure of inferences, rather than the structure of entities, so they do not suffer from the same problem. Hence in many ways these approaches are complementary to knowledge-base embedding approaches, and the relative performance of the methods on a task probably depends on the sparsity of relations associated with entities (with more relations per entity favoring embedding models) versus the regularity of the inference process (with logically simpler inferences favoring rule learning approaches). We note that on some standard knowledge-base embedding tasks, previous comparisons have shown that ISG is quantitatively competitive with knowledge-base embedding approaches (Wang & Cohen, 2016)."

Unfortunately this learning problem is difficult, since determining the structure of the theory normally requires solving a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: a completely differentiable model for learning sets of first-order rules. The approach is inspired by a recently-developed differentiable logic, i.e. a subset of first-order logic for which inference tasks can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. Here we describe a neural controller system which learns how to sequentially compose the these primitive differentiable operations to solve reasoning tasks, and in particular, to perform knowledge base completion. The long-term goal of this work is to develop integrated, end-to-end systems that can learn to perform high-level logical reasoning as well as lower-level perceptual tasks.",
