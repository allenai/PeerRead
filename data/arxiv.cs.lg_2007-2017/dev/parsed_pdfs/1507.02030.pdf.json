      "text" : "The Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) algorithm, is an adaptation of Gradient Descent, which updates according to the direction of the gradients, rather than the gradients themselves. In this paper we analyze a stochastic version of NGD and prove its convergence to a global minimum for a wider class of functions: we require the functions to be quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz. Quasi-convexity broadens the concept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain types of saddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be Lipschitz in a small region around the optimum. This assumption circumvents gradient explosion, which is another known hurdle for gradient descent variants.\nInterestingly, unlike the vanilla SGD algorithm, the stochastic normalized gradient descent algorithm provably requires a minimal minibatch size."

      "text" : "The benefits of using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) scheme for learning could not be stressed enough. For convex and Lipschitz objectives, SGD is guaranteed to find an - optimal solution within O(1/ 2) iterations and requires only an unbiased estimator for the gradient, which is obtained with only one (or a few) data samples. However, when applied to non-convex problems several drawbacks are revealed. In particular, SGD is widely used for deep learning Bengio (2009), one of the most interesting fields where stochastic non-convex optimization problems arise. Often, the objective in these kind of problems demonstrates\n∗Princeton University; ehazan@cs.princeton.edu. †Technion; kfiryl@tx.technion.ac.il. ‡The Hebrew University; shais@cs.huji.ac.il.\nar X\niv :1\n50 7.\n02 03\n0v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n8 O\nct 2\ntwo extreme phenomena: on the one hand plateaus, i.e., regions with very small gradients; and on the other hand sharp cliffs, i.e., exceedingly high gradients. As is expected, applying SGD to these problems is often reported to yield unsatisfactory results.\nIn this paper we analyze a stochastic version of the Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) algorithm, which we denote by SNGD. Each iteration of SNGD is as simple and efficient as SGD, but is much more appropriate for non-convex optimization problems, overcoming some of the pitfalls that SGD may encounter. Particularly, we define a family of locally-quasiconvex and locally-Lipschitz functions, and prove that SNGD is suitable for optimizing such objectives.\nLocal-Quasi-convexity is a generalization of unimodal functions to multidimensions, which includes quasi-convex, and convex functions as a subclass. Locally-Quasi-convex functions allow for certain types of plateaus and saddle points which are difficult for SGD and other gradient descent variants. Local-Lipschitzness is a generalization of Lipschitz functions that only assumes Lipschitzness in a small region around the minima, whereas farther away the gradients may be unbounded. Gradient explosion is, thus, another difficulty that is successfully tackled by SNGD and poses difficulties for other stochastic gradient descent variants.\nOur contributions:\n• We introduce local-quasi-convexity, a property that extends quasi-convexity and captures unimodal functions which are not quasi-convex. We prove that NGD finds an -optimal minimum for such functions within O(1/ 2) iterations. As a special case, we show that the above rate can be attained for quasi-convex functions that are Lipschitz in an Ω( )-region around the optimum (gradients may be unbounded outside this region). For objectives that are also smooth in an Ω( √ )-region around the optimum,\nwe prove a faster rate of O(1/ ).\n• We introduce a new setup: stochastic optimization of locally-quasi-convex functions; and show that this setup captures Generalized Linear Models (GLM) regression, McCullagh and Nelder (1989). For this setup, we devise a stochastic version of NGD (SNGD), and show that it converges within O(1/ 2) iterations to an -optimal minimum.\n• The above positive result requires that at each iteration of SNGD, the gradient should be estimated using a minibatch of a minimal size. We provide a negative result showing that if the minibatch size is too small then the algorithm might indeed diverge.\n• We report experimental results supporting our theoretical guarantees and demonstrate an accelerated convergence attained by SNGD."

It is well known that quasi-convex optimization tasks\ncan be solved by a series of convex feasibility problems Boyd and Vandenberghe (2004); However, generally solving such feasibility problems may be very costly Goffin et al. (1996).\nThere exists a rich literature concerning quasi-convex optimization in the offline case, Polyak (1967); Zabotin et al. (1972); Khabibullin (1977); Sikorski (1986). A pioneering paper by Nesterov (1984), was the first to suggest an efficient algorithm, namely Normalized Gradient Descent, and prove that this algorithm attains -optimal solution within O(1/ 2) iterations given a differentiable quasi-convex objective. This work was later extended by Kiwiel (2001), showing that the same result may be achieved assuming upper semi-continuous quasi-convex objectives. In Konnov (2003) it was shown how to attain faster rates for quasi-convex optimization, but they assume to know the optimal value of the objective, an assumption that generally does not hold in practice.\nAmong the deep learning community there have been several attempts to tackle gradientexplosion/plateaus. Ideas spanning gradient-clipping Pascanu et al. (2013), smart initialization Doya (1993), and more, Martens and Sutskever (2011), have shown to improve training in practice. Yet, non of these works provides a theoretical analysis showing better convergence guarantees.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no previous results on stochastic versions of NGD, neither results regarding locally-quasi-convex/locally-Lipschitz functions.\nGradient descent with fixed step sizes, including its stochastic variants, is known to perform poorly when the gradients are too small in a plateau area of the function, or alternatively when the other extreme happens: gradient explosions. These two phenomena have been reported in certain types of non-convex optimization, such as training of deep networks.\nFigure 1 depicts a one-dimensional family of functions for which GD behaves provably poorly. With a large step-size, GD will hit the cliffs and then oscillate between the two boundaries. Alternatively, with a small step size, the low gradients will cause GD to miss the middle valley which has constant size of 1/2. On the other hand, this exact function is quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz, and hence the NGD algorithm provably converges to the optimum quickly."

(2)\nIt is natural to consider g as unimodal since it acquires no local minima but for the unique global minima at x∗ = (−10,−10). However, g is not quasi-convex: consider the points x = (log 16,− log 4),y = (− log 4, log 16), which belong to the 1.2-sub-level set, their average does not belong to the same sub-level-set since g(x/2 + y/2) = 4/3.\nQuasi-convex functions always enable us to explore, meaning that the gradient always directs us in a global descent direction. Intuitively, from an optimization point of view, we only need such a direction whenever we do not exploit, i.e., whenever we are not approximately optimal.\nIn what follows we define local-quasi-convexity, a property that enables us to either explore/exploit. This property 1 captures a wider class of unimodal function (such as g above) rather than mere quasi-convexity. Later we justify this definition by showing that it captures Generalized Linear Models (GLM) regression, see McCullagh and Nelder (1989); Kalai and Sastry (2009).\nDefinition 3.1.

We are not familiar with a similar guarantee for SGD even in the convex case.\nRemark 3. Theorem 5.1 requires the minibatch size to be Ω(1/ 2). In the context of learning, the number of functions, n, corresponds to the number of training examples. By standard sample complexity bounds, n should also be order of 1/ 2. Therefore, one may wonder, if the size of the minibatch should be order of n. This is not true, since the required training set size is 1/ 2 times the VC dimension of the hypothesis class. In many practical cases, the VC dimension is more significant than 1/ 2, and therefore n will be much larger than the required minibatch size. The reason our analysis requires a minibatch of size 1/ 2, without the VC dimension factor, is because we are just “validating” and not “learning”.\nIn SGD and for the case of convex functions, even a minibatch of size 1 suffices for guaranteed convergence. In contrast, for SNGD we require a minibatch of size 1/ 2. The theorem below shows that the requirement for a large minibatch is not an artifact of our analysis but is truly required.\nTheorem 5.2.

In the second lemma, we show that for a large enough minibatch size b, then for any t ∈ [T ] we have f(xt) ≤ ft(xt)+ , and f(x∗) ≥ ft(x∗)− .

To prove Theorem 5.2, we construct a counter example in one dimension. Consider the following distribution D over loss functions:\nf(x) = { −0.5 x w.p. 1− (1− 0.5 ) max{x + 3, 0} w.p. (4)\nIt can be verified that the optimum of ED[f(x)] is in x ∗ = −3 , and that the slope of the expected loss in (−3,∞) is 0.5 . Also notice that all points in the segment [−5,−1] are -optimal.\nSuppose we use SNGD with a batchsize of b = 0.2\n, i.e., we sample the gradient b times at any query point, and then average the samples and take the sign. Assume that at time t the queried point is greater than x∗ = −3. Let Yt be the averaged gradient over the\nbatch received at time t, and define p = P (Yt ≥ 0), i.e., the probability that this sign is non-negative. Then the following is a lower bound on 1− p:\n1− p := P (Yt < 0) ≥ (1− )b = (1− )0.2/ ,\nwhere (1− )b is the probability that all b samples are negative. Now, consider the function G( ) = (1 − )0.2/ , It can be shown that G is monotonically decreasing in [0, 1], and that G(0.1) ≥ 0.8. Therefore, for any ∈ [0, 0.1] we have, p ≤ 0.2.\nNow, let {Xt}t∈[T ], be the random variables describing the queries of SNGD under the distribution over loss functions given in Equation (4). Also assume that we start SNGD with X1 = 0, i.e., at a distance of D = 3 from the optimum. Then the points that SNGD queries are on the discrete lattice {iη}i∈Z , and the following holds:\nXt+1|{Xt = iη} = {\n(i− 1)η w.p. p (i+ 1)η w.p. 1− p\nLet i0 = d−1/ηe, note that i0 is the minimal number of steps required by SNGD to arrive from X1 = 0, to an -optimal solution. Now in order to analyze the probability that SNGD ever arrives at an -optimal point, it is sufficient to consider the Markov chain over the lattice {iη}i∈Z with the state S0 = i0η, as an absorbing state. Using Lemma 5.3 we conclude that if we start at X1 = 0 then the probability that we ever absorb is:\nP (∃t > 0 : Xt is -optimal |X0 = 0) ≤ ( p\n1− p\n) 1 η −1\n≤ ( 1\n4\n) 1 −1\n≤ ( 1\n4\n)9 ,\nwhere we used p ≤ 0.2, a bound of G = 1 on the gradients of losses; NGD’s learning rate η = /G, and ≤ 0.1."

We employ a regularization over weights with a parameter of λ = 5 · 10−4.\nAt first we were interested in comparing the performance of SNGD to MSGD (Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent), and to a stochastic variant of Nesterov’s accelerated gradient\nmethod Sutskever et al.

For SNGD we used the constant step size of 0.1. In Nesterov’s method we used a momentum of 0.95. The comparison appears in Figures 2(a),2(b). As expected, MSGD converges relatively slowly. Conversely, the performance of SNGD is comparable with Nesterov’s method. All methods employed a minibatch size of 100.\nLater, we were interested in examining the effect of minibatch size on the performance of SNGD. We employed SNGD with different minibatch sizes.

However, it is clear that it does not capture piecewise constant and quasi-convex functions, such as the zero-one loss, or the Perceptron problem.\nIn some cases, e.g. the Perceptron problem, we may have an access to a direction oracle, G : Rd 7→ Rd. This oracle is a proxy to the gradient, aiming us in a global ascent (descent) direction. Following is a broader definition of locally-quasi-convex functions:\nDefinition H.1. (Local-Quasi-Convexity) Let x, z ∈ Rd, κ, > 0. Also let G : Rd 7→ Rd.

Note that we can show that NGD/SNGD and their guarantees still hold for SLQC functions with a direction oracle. The algorithms and proofs are very similar to the ones that appear in the paper, and we therefore omit the details.\nIn the following section we illustrate a scenario that fits the above definition.\nH.1 The γ-margin Perceptron\nIn this setup we have a collection of m samples {(xi, yi)}mi=1 ∈ Bd × {0, 1} ,and we are guaranteed to have w∗ ∈ Rd such that: yi〈w∗,xi〉 ≥ γ, ∀i ∈ [m]. Thus, using the sign of 〈w∗, xi〉 as a predictor, it classifies all the points correctly (with a margin of γ).\nLetting φ be the zero-one loss φ(z) = 1 z≥0, we measure the performance of a predictor w ∈ Rd, by the average (square) error over all samples,\nêrrm(w) = 1\nm m∑ i=1 (yi − φ〈w,xi〉)2 .

Luckily, from the convergence analysis of the Perceptron (see e.g. Kalai and Sastry (2009)), we know the following to be a direction oracle for êrrm(w):\nG(w) = 1 m m∑ i=1 (φ〈w,xi〉 − yi) xi . (10)\nThe next lemma states that in the above setup, the error function is SLQC with respect to G. This implies that Algorithm 1 finds an -optimal minima of êrrm(w) within poly(1/ ) iterations.\nLemma H.1. Consider the γ-margin Perceptron problem. Then the error function appearing in Equation (9) is ( , 2/γ,w∗)-SLQC in w, ∀ ∈ (0, 1), ∀w ∈ Rd with respect to the direction oracle appearing in Equation (10).\nProof. Given ∈ (0, 1), we will show that êrrm is ( , 2/γ,w∗)-SLQC at every w ∈ Rd. Consider w ∈ Rd such that êrrm(w) = 1m ∑m i=1(yi − φ〈w,xi〉)2 ≥ .

It is well known that convex and Lipschitz functions can be minimized efficiently using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) algorithm, is an adaptation of Gradient Descent, which updates according to the direction of the gradients, rather than the gradients themselves. In this paper we analyze a stochastic version of NGD and prove its convergence to a global minimum for a wider class of functions: we require the functions to be quasi-convex and locally-Lipschitz. Quasi-convexity broadens the concept of unimodality to multidimensions and allows for certain types of saddle points, which are a known hurdle for first-order optimization methods such as gradient descent. Locally-Lipschitz functions are only required to be Lipschitz in a small region around the optimum. This assumption circumvents gradient explosion, which is another known hurdle for gradient descent variants. Interestingly, unlike the vanilla SGD algorithm, the stochastic normalized gradient descent algorithm provably requires a minimal minibatch size.",
