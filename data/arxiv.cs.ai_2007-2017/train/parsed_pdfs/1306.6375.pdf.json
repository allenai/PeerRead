A risk assessment method is then used to identify the flood risk in each community using the following risk factors: the area's urbanized area ratio, literacy rate, mortality rate, poverty incidence, radio/TV penetration, and state of structural and non-structural measures. Vulnerability is defined as a weighted-sum of these components. A „penalty‟ was imposed for reduced vulnerability. Optimization comparison was done with MatLab‟s Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing; Results showed „extreme‟ solutions and realistic designs, for simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, respectively.\nINTRODUCTION\nDisaster Risk Management (DRM) at the local, regional, and global scale continues to generate great research interest of a complex, multidisciplinary nature, involving the interplay of scientific, social, economic, and political dimensions. Driven by the series of disasters of increasing frequency and magnitude, DRM meaning and context has evolved into an internationally accepted definition: a systemic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing risk of all kinds associated with hazards and human activities with identified operational and practical disaster risk reduction initiatives. These initiatives have been clarified by the international community through UN‟s 2005 World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan and accepted as the DRR framework, known as the Hyogo Framework of Action [1].\nThe ultimate objective of all DRM initiatives remains simple: reduce the loss of lives and property, and improve the capacity of communities to cope with disasters. The 2005 Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA) has been used to review UN member states‟ respective DRM initiatives. HFA outlines five (5) priorities for implementation: (1) Ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and a local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation, (2) Identify, assess and\n2 of 8\nmonitor disaster risks and enhance early warning, (3) Use knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels, (4) Reduce the underlying risk factors, and (5) Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels. This paper, however small, contributes to the fulfillment of HFA‟s priority action no. 4 that seeks to reduce the underlying (disaster) risk factors.\nAdopting flood as the specific natural hazard, this study compares two (2) mathematical methods, Genetic Algorithm and Simulated Annealing, to identify optimal characteristics of a hypothetical city that would lessen flood hazard risks resulting to reduction in costs, i.e. damage of properties and use of resources. Although the results and analysis presented in this study is not intended an existing city, the mathematical program developed in this research may be useful for city planners and urban developers in projected scenarios and plans of a disaster resilient city.\nResearch and similar studies have been undertaken for the past 10 years. In early 2008, the IBM research laboratories in the U.S and India had launched a disaster management technology/software to help relevant government and non-government agencies and offices model and manage natural disasters, i.e. wildfires, floods, and diseases. Known as Stochastic Optimization Models for Natural Disasters, IBM created a set of intellectual properties and software assets that can be employed to gauge and improve levels of preparedness to tackle unforeseen natural disasters involving most realworld uncertainty factors such as politics, custom and culture making results grow less uncertain and more accurate and acceptable [2].\nBACKGROUND Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used because of the this case‟s high dimensionality that is similar to a multi-objective urban planning problem tackled by Balling et al. in [3] where direct methods are intractable, if not impossible to use.\nGA, copies the natural evolution, i.e., inheritance, mutation, selection and crossover, has been widely used to solve engineering optimization problems. Adapting concept of dog and/or cattle breeding, the method takes champion males and females to breed, in the hope of producing desirable „traits‟ in the offspring. Here, a „champion‟ city has the desirable trait of a low vulnerability to flooding. The „chromosomes‟ for our „champion‟ cities, and the GA will then take care of „breeding‟ the cities, looking for the one with lowest vulnerability and cost.\nAnother widely used metaheuristic that mimics metallurgy‟s annealing process– that of slow cooling to provide atoms more chances of finding configurations with lower internal energy in order to increase crystal sizes and reduce the defects - the Simulated Annealing (SA) in this study, slowly reduces the extent of the search by looking for „nearby‟ points for lower energy-solutions.\nThis paper uses the same fitness and cost functions to be able to compare designs or solutions from GA and SA, integrating previous research done in [4] and [5] using flood as the natural hazard. All disaster management plans begins with the identification of risk (UN/ISDR, 2004), see [6].\nRisk (flood) is an indicator of how prone a specific area is for a natural hazard to turn into a\ndisaster; it is a function of three factors defined by this equation: Eqn. 1: Flood Risk = Hazard x Vulnerability x Exposure, where\nVulnerability is expressed in a linear, very predictable function as: Eqn. 2: Vulnerability = (A)Urbanization + (B)Literacy Rate + (C)Mortality Rate + 2* (D)Poverty\n+ (E)Radio/TV + (F)Non-structural measures + (G)Structural measures\nVulnerability is at its minimum when values of each component are zero (0). Weight of each components were assumed and pegged at one (1), while poverty was given twice (2) the weight as\n3 of 8\nsuggested by a previous earthquake vulnerability studies by Lo and Oreta [5] posits that poorer communities are more vulnerable to disasters. Studies may be conducted separately to fine-tune values of different components.\nDynamics were introduced into the system by imposing a „penalty‟ or cost function. Consider poverty: A low poverty area is desirable, as it is deemed less vulnerable to flooding and other hazards. It would have a vulnerability of zero. We now impose a „penalty‟, the cost of getting out of vulnerability, which might also be interpreted as the cost of the solution to poverty.\nWhenever natural hazards are concerned, little can be done on the hazard probability of an area for a specific disaster as it is predominantly defined by geographic location. This is also true for exposure, in the Philippines, a disaster-prone area, i.e. flood prone due to rainfall hazards, is geography-based. The reason why most disaster management plans, if not all, focus on modifying the vulnerability index to minimize risk. This study adopted this approach.\nMETHODOLOGY\nDefining the domain and weights. The hypothetical study area is divided into several computational units also defined as the political boundaries, e.g., barangays (communities or neighborhoods in a city). A 6 by 6 grid is used to represent the city and its 36 areas/ barangays. Please refer to Figure 1.\nFirst, we define the physical area. The numbers inside each cell represent physical properties of the area that might make it more or less vulnerable to flooding; each cells represent each barangay. It will also be used to multiply the area‟s vulnerability. Here, we may imagine a river running diagonally down the grid, from right to left. Hence, the barangays on the right diagonal lie on a flood plain, and will have a factor of two (to double the vulnerability). We assume the terrain rises a bit above the flood plain on either side of the diagonal. Thus, it will have a value of 1 (will not affect vulnerability). Those barangays farthest from the floodplain, assumed to be on higher ground, will have a factor of ½, to indicate lower vulnerability.\nEach unit, barangay, is considered an organism, with its own set of chromosomes, whose values\nwere initially assigned. The values of each chromosome give the design of the city and will be used to produce the designs in the next iterations. In the final iteration, the optimal set of chromosomes will be interpreted.\nSetting component cost/penalty values. The objective function for both GA (usually called „fitness‟ function in GA applications) and SA will have the following components, as stated in the vulnerability value expressed in Eqn. 2:\n(A)Urbanized area ratio – Non-urbanized areas are devoid of infrastructure and residents. The less\npeople and infrastructure, the lower the vulnerability to flooding. 11 = Highly urbanized 10 = Moderately urbanized 01 = A little urbanized 00 = Not urbanized\n(B)Literacy Rate – This requires that communities understand warning signs from the government and follow instructions from emergency responders. It has implications on the over-all community preparedness to disasters. A high illiteracy rate equals vulnerability to flooding.\n11 = more than 75% are illiterate 10 = 50 – 75% are illiterate 01 = 25 – 50% are illiterate 00 = 0 – 25% are illiterate\nFigure 1. 6x6 grid representing a city\n½ ½ ½ ½ 1 2\n½ ½ ½ 1 2 1\n½ ½ 1 2 1 ½\n½ 1 2 1 ½ ½\n1 2 1 ½ ½ ½\n2 1 ½ ½ ½ ½\n4 of 8\n(C)Mortality Rate – The mortality rate is taken as an indicator of the general health of the\npopulation. Although it is closely associated with poverty, it is treated as separate variable as reflection of separate data source, different government agencies, health and poverty data from Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), respectively. High mortality rate also mean high vulnerability.\n11 = High mortality rate 10 = Average mortality rate 01 = Below average mortality rate 00 = Low mortality rate\n(D)Poverty (incidence) – Poor members of community are more vulnerable to disaster; both immediate effect and the aftermath of flood. While floods tend to affect wide areas and all socioeconomic classes, it is expected that members with more resources to have a shorter recovery time and have more options that include moving to other non-flooded areas. High poverty incidence (in the area) increases its vulnerability to flooding.\n11 = more than 75% in class D 10 = 50 – 75% in class D 01 = 25 – 50% in class D 00 = 0 – 25% in class D\n(E)TV / Radio (penetration rate) – Access to communication devices means timely receipt of broadcast news and warning. Mass media is a critical factor in disaster preparedness. Less penetration rate increases vulnerability to flooding.\n11 = less than 25% penetration rate 10 = 25 – 50% penetration rate 01 = 50 – 75% penetration rate 00 = 75 – 100% penetration rate\n(F)State of non-structural measures – This pertains to legislated laws and, more importantly, compliance to laws that were meant to minimize flood risks, i.e. easements on waterways, cleaning drainages, litter prevention, etc. High incidence of implementation of laws in an area means low vulnerability to flooding.\n11 = no non-structural measure 10 = existing with poor implementation/compliance 01 = existing with average implementation/compliance 00 = existing with good implementation/compliance\n(G)State of structural measures – Infrastructures built to prevent and/or control floods, i.e. drainage, floodgates, pumping stations, etc. More and better-maintained infrastructures mean less vulnerable to flooding.\n11 = no structural measure 10 = existing structural measure in poor condition 01 = existing structural measure in average condition 00 = existing structural measure in good condition\nThese variables were used as costs and input to vulnerability function that will be minimized using both GA and SA methods. As stated in Eqn. 2 in the previous section, vulnerability, Vi, is expressed simply as a linear sum of the numerical values of the “chromosomes”, multiplying the poverty “chromosome” by two. The Lo and Oreta study [5] cited poverty prominently, hence the double weight.\nVi = Si*(XiUrbanized + XiLiteracy + XiMortality + 2*XiPoverty + XiTvRadio+XiNonStructural + XiStructural)\nThe cost or penalty function counter-acts the vulnerability value. The chromosomes are modeled\nas binary numbers, with “00” (zero) being smallest, “11” (three) highest. The penalty function is\n5 of 8\ndeveloped by first taking the three‟s complement of vulnerability. Thus, the lowest vulnerability will have the highest cost, and vice versa. The complement is then entered into a function, which may be exponential (for „expensive‟ items like poverty alleviation); quadratic (for relatively expensive items like improving health), or inexpensive, like formulating laws to protect against flooding. These assessments will vary from place to place, depending on the relative costs of the activity or solution (penalty).\nExponential growth for „expensive‟ activities like urbanization, poverty alleviation and building structural measures were assumed. All other chromosomes were assumed to have linear penalties, except the mortality variable, which was assumed to be quadratic. These cost functions are hypotheses, and could be interpolated from data, when available. This could be the object of future research.\nCi = (℮xp(3-XiUrbanized) + 3 - XiLiteracy + (3 - XiMortality) 2 + ℮xp(3-XiPoverty) + 3- XiTvRadio + 3 -\nXiNonStructural + ℮xp(3-XiStructural)) / Si\nA single-objective Simulated Annealing (SA) was used; the cost function had to be scaled to give\nroughly the same weight as vulnerability:\nCi =(℮ 3-\n+ 3 - XiLiteracy + (3 - XiMortality) 2 + ℮ 3- + 3- XiTvRadio + 3 - XiNonStructural +\n℮ 3-\n)*3.26/Si\nTogether with the equations stated above, the chromosomes (values) were inputted into MatLab‟s\ngenetic algorithms toolbox and that of simulated annealing.\nXiUrbanized XiPoverty\nXiStructural\n6 of 8\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nGA and SA program iteration runs produced the following optimal arrangements for the 36\nbarangays, broken-down by their „traits‟ or chromosomes as:\nGenetic Algorithm Results:\n1. It allowed 2 poor barangays along the diagonal, flood prone area. This gives us insight on designing housing for flood plains which is a special concern in the Philippines with high poverty incidence; 2. It assumes 9 units to be compliant to rules and regulations and placed worst offenders away from floodplains; and 3.

State of non-structural measures: Only totally compliant areas, 0,are situated in the floodplain.\nState of structural measures: Managed to assign the most protected areas, 0, on the floodplain.\nAlthough Simulated Annealing produced technically better results, it seems almost unrealistic to implement in real life, e.g., SA handles the poverty chromosome by turning the floodplain into a “millionaire‟s row”, and very unrealistically allows only one very poor area in the city of 36 barangays;\nThe SA result gives us the insight that, on the floodplain, we could strive for strict enforcement of laws that protect from flooding while GA tells us to avoid putting high-risk areas (relative to any given chromosome) right on the flood plain, e.g., it tries to avoid situating very poor areas on the flood plain, and places worse offenders of laws away from the floodplain.\n8 of 8\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY\nThe model and its recommendations are dependent on the previous assumptions made on vulnerability and penalty equations, and both may still be developed and improved in further studies.\nEinarsson and Rausand attempted to prioritize the components of vulnerability for industrial systems in [8] while the state government of Michigan, USA, attempted to prioritize the hazards as published [9].\nThere is an ongoing experiment adopting the algorithm in [9] to prioritize components of vulnerability as well as allowing non-liner interactions between related components on poverty with mortality, and literacy with radio/TV penetration.\nThe penalty equations may be improved by interpolating available data on the components of\nvulnerability.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Hyogo Framework for Action.
