      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Industrial Internet has given rise to availability of sensor data from numerous machines belonging to various domains such as agriculture, energy, manufacturing etc. These sensor readings can indicate health of the machines. This has led to increased business desire to perform maintenance of these machines based on their condition rather than following the current industry practice of time-based maintenance. It has also been shown that condition-based maintenance can lead to significant financial savings. Such goals can be achieved by building models for prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of the machines, based on their sensor readings.\nTraditional approach for RUL prediction is based on an assumption that the health degradation curves (drawn w.r.t. time) follow specific shape such as exponential or linear. Under this assumption we can build a model for health index (HI) prediction, as a function of sensor readings. Extrapolation of HI is used for prediction of RUL [29, 24, 25]. However, we observed that such assumptions do not hold in the real-world datasets, making the problem harder to solve. Some of the important challenges in solving the prognostics problem are: i) health degradation curve may not necessarily follow a fixed shape, ii) time to reach same level of degradation by machines of same specifications is often different, iii) each instance has a slightly different initial health or wear, iv) sensor readings if available are\nPresented at 1st ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Machine Learning for Prognostics and Health Management, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2016. Copyright 2016 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.\nnoisy, v) sensor data till end-of-life is not easily available because in practice periodic maintenance is performed.\nApart from the health index (HI) based approach as described above, mathematical models of the underlying physical system, fault propagation models and conventional reliability models have also been used for RUL estimation [5, 26]. Data-driven models which use readings of sensors carrying degradation or wear information such as vibration in a bearing have been effectively used to build RUL estimation models [28, 29, 37]. Typically, sensor readings over the entire operational life of multiple instances of a system from start till failure are used to obtain common degradation behavior trends or to build models of how a system degrades by estimating health in terms of HI. Any new instance is then compared with these trends and the most similar trends are used to estimate the RUL [40].\nLSTM networks are recurrent neural network models that have been successfully used for many sequence learning and temporal modeling tasks [12, 2] such as handwriting recognition, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, and customer behavior prediction. A variant of LSTM networks, LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) model has been successfully used for sequence-to-sequence learning tasks [8, 34, 4] like machine translation, natural language generation and reconstruction, parsing, and image captioning. LSTM-ED works as follows: An LSTM-based encoder is used to map a multivariate input sequence to a fixed-dimensional vector representation. The decoder is another LSTM network which uses this vector representation to produce the target sequence. We provide further details on LSTM-ED in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.\nLSTM Encoder-decoder based approaches have been proposed for anomaly detection [21, 23]. These approaches learn a model to reconstruct the normal data (e.g. when machine is in perfect health) such that the learned model could reconstruct the subsequences which belong to normal behavior. The learnt model leads to high reconstruction error for anomalous or novel subsequences, since it has not seen such data during training. Based on similar ideas, we use Long Short-Term Memory [14] Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) for RUL estimation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised technique to obtain a health index (HI) for a system using multi-sensor time-series data, which does not make any assumption on the shape of the degradation curve. We use LSTM-ED to learn a model of normal behavior of a system, which is trained to reconstruct multivariate time-series corresponding to normal behavior. The reconstruction error at a point in a time-series is used ar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n06 15\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n2 A\nug 2\n01 6\nto compute HI at that point. In this paper, we show that:\n• LSTM-ED based HI learnt in an unsupervised manner is able to capture the degradation in a system: the HI decreases as the system degrades.\n• LSTM-ED based HI can be used to learn a model for RUL estimation instead of relying on domain knowledge, or exponential/linear degradation assumption, while achieving comparable performance.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: We formally introduce the problem and provide an overview of our approach in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe Linear Regression (LR) based approach to estimate the health index and discuss commonly used assumptions to obtain these estimates. In Section 4, we describe how LSTM-ED can be used to learn the LR model without relying on domain knowledge or mathematical models for degradation evolution. In Section 5, we explain how we use the HI curves of train instances and a new test instance to estimate the RUL of the new instance. We provide details of experiments and results on three datasets in Section 6. Finally, we conclude with a discussion in Section 8, after a summary of related work in Section 7."

      "text" : "We consider the scenario where historical instances of a system with multi-sensor data readings till end-of-life are available. The goal is to estimate the RUL of a currently operational instance of the system for which multi-sensor data is available till current time-instance.\nMore formally, we consider a set of train instances U of a system. For each instance u ∈ U , we consider a multivariate time-series of sensor readings X(u) = [x\n(u) 1 x (u) 2 ... x (u)\nL(u) ]\nwith L(u) cycles where the last cycle corresponds to the end-of-life, each point x (u) t ∈ Rm is an m-dimensional vector corresponding to readings for m sensors at time-instance t. The sensor data is z-normalized such that the sensor reading x (u) tj at time t for jth sensor for instance u is transformed to x (u) tj −µj σj , where µj and σj are mean and standard deviation for the jth sensor’s readings over all cycles from all instances in U . (Note: When multiple modes of normal operation exist, each point can normalized based on the µj and σj for that mode of operation, as suggested in [39].) A subsequence of length l for time-series X(u) starting from time instance t is denoted by X(u)(t, l) = [x (u) t x (u) t+1 ... x (u) t+l−1] with 1 ≤ t ≤ L(u) − l + 1. In many real-world multi-sensor data, sensors are correlated. As in [39, 24, 25], we use Principal Components Analysis to obtain derived sensors from the normalized sensor data with reduced linear correlations between them. The multivariate time-series for the derived sensors is represented as Z(u) = [z\n(u) 1 z (u) 2 ... z (u)\nL(u) ], where z\n(u) t ∈ Rp, p\nis the number of principal components considered (The best value of p can be obtained using a validation set).\nFor a new instance u∗ with sensor readings X(u ∗) over L(u ∗) cycles, the goal is to estimate the remaining useful life R(u ∗) in terms of number of cycles, given the time-series data for train instances {X(u) : u ∈ U}. We describe our approach assuming same operating regime for the entire life of the system. The approach can be easily extended to\nmultiple operating regimes scenario by treating data for each regime separately (similar to [39, 17]), as described in one of our case studies on milling machine dataset in Section 6.3."

LSTM-ED is trained to reconstruct the normal (healthy) subsequences of length l from all the training instances. The LSTM encoder learns a fixed length vector representation of the input time-series and the LSTM decoder uses this representation to reconstruct the time-series using the current hidden state and the value predicted at the previous time-step. Given a time-series Z = [z1 z2 ... zl], a (E) t is the hidden state of encoder at time t for each t ∈ {1, 2, ..., l}, where a(E)t ∈ Rc, c is the number of LSTM units in the hidden layer of the\nencoder. The encoder and decoder are jointly trained to reconstruct the time-series in reverse order (similar to [34]), i.e., the target time-series is [zl zl−1 ... z1].

      "heading" : "5. RUL ESTIMATION USING HI CURVE MATCHING",
      "text" : "Similar to [39, 40], the HI curve for a test instance u∗ is compared to the HI curves of all the train instances u ∈ U . The test instance and train instance may take different number of cycles to reach the same degradation level (HI value). Fig. 3 shows a sample scenario where HI curve for a test instance is matched with HI curve for a train instance by varying the time-lag. The time-lag which corresponds to minimum Euclidean distance between the HI curves of the train and test instance is shown. For a given time-lag, the number of remaining cycles for the train instance after the last cycle of the test instance gives the RUL estimate for the test instance. Let u∗ be a test instance and u be a train instance. Similar to [29, 9, 13], we take into account the following scenarios for curve matching based RUL estimation: 1) Varying initial health across instances: The initial health of an instance varies depending on various factors such as the inherent inconsistencies in the manufacturing process. We assume initial health to be close to 1. In order to ensure this, the HI values for an instance are divided by the average of its first few HI values (e.g. first 5% cycles). Also, while comparing HI curves H(u ∗) and H(u), we allow for a time-lag\nt such that the HI values of u∗ may be close to the HI values of H(u)(t, L(u\n∗)) at time t such that t ≤ τ (see Eqs. 8-10). This takes care of instance specific variances in degree of initial wear and degradation evolution. 2) Multiple time-lags with high similarity : The HI curve H(u ∗) may have high similarity with H(u)(t, L(u∗)) for multiple values of time-lag t. We consider multiple RUL estimates for u∗ based on total life of u, rather than considering only the RUL estimate corresponding to the time-lag t with minimum Euclidean distance between the curves H(u ∗) and H(u)(t, L(u ∗)). The multiple RUL estimates corresponding to each time-lag are assigned weights proportional to the similarity of the curves to get the final RUL estimate (see Eq. 10). 3) Non-monotonic HI : Due to inherent noise in sensor readings, HI curves obtained using LR are non-monotonic. To reduce the noise in the estimates of HI, we use moving average smoothening. 4) Maximum value of RUL estimate: When an instance is in very good health or has been operational for few cycles, estimating RUL is difficult. We limit the maximum RUL estimate for any test instance to Rmax. Also, the maximum RUL estimate for the instance u∗ based on HI curve comparison with instance u is limited by L(u)−L(u\n∗). This implies that the maximum RUL estimate for any test instance u will be such that the total length R̂(u ∗) +L(u ∗) ≤ Lmax, where Lmax is the maximum length for any training instance available. Fewer the number of cycles available for a test instance, more difficult it becomes to estimate the RUL.\nWe define similarity between HI curves of test instance u∗\nand train instance u with time-lag t as:\ns(u∗, u, t) = exp(−d2(u∗, u, t)/λ) (8)\nwhere,\nd2(u∗, u, t) = 1\nL(u∗)\nL(u ∗)∑\ni=1\n(h (u∗) i − h (u) i+t) 2 (9)\nis the squared Euclidean distance between H(u ∗)(1, L(u ∗))\nand H(u)(t, L(u ∗)), and λ > 0, t ∈ {1, 2, ..., τ}, t + L(u ∗) ≤ L(u). Here, λ controls the notion of similarity: a small value of λ would imply large difference in s even when d is not large. The RUL estimate for u∗ based on the HI curve for u and for time-lag t is given by R̂(u ∗)(u, t) = L(u) −L(u ∗) − t.\nThe estimate R̂(u ∗)(u, t) is assigned a weight of s(u∗, u, t)\nsuch that the weighted average estimate R̂(u ∗) for R(u ∗) is given by\nR̂(u ∗) =\n∑ s(u∗, u, t).R̂(u\n∗)(u, t)∑ s(u∗, u, t)\n(10)\nwhere the summation is over only those combinations of u and t which satisfy s(u∗, u, t) ≥ α.smax, where smax = maxu∈U,t∈{1 ... τ}{s(u∗, u, t)}, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1.\nIt is to be noted that the parameter α decides the number of RUL estimates R̂(u ∗)(u, t) to be considered to get the final RUL estimate R̂(u ∗). Also, variance of the RUL estimates R̂(u ∗)(u, t) considered for computing R̂(u\n∗) can be used as a measure of confidence in the prediction, which is useful in practical applications (for example, see Section 6.2.2). During the initial stages of an instance’s usage, when it is in good health and a fault has still not appeared, estimating\nRUL is tough, as it is difficult to know beforehand how exactly the fault would evolve over time once it appears."

We found that LR-ED2 performs significantly better compared to the other three models. LR-ED2 is better than the LR-Exp model which uses domain knowledge in the form of exponential degradation assumption. We also provide comparison with RULCLIPPER (RC) [29] which (to the best of our knowledge) has the best performance in terms of timeliness S, accuracy A, MAE, and MSE [31] reported in the literature1 on the turbofan dataset considered and four other turbofan engine datasets (Note: Unlike RC, we learn the parameters of the model on a validation set rather than test set.) RC relies on the exponential assumption to estimate a HI polygon and uses intersection of areas of polygons of train and test engines as a measure of similarity to estimate RUL (similar to Eq. 10, see [29] for details). The results show that LR-ED2 gives performance comparable to RC without relying on the domain-knowledge based exponential assumption.\nThe worst predicted test instance for LR-Exp, LR-ED1 and LR-ED2 contributes 23%, 17%, and 23%, respectively, to the timeliness score S. For LR-Exp and LR-ED2 it is nearly 1/4th of the total score, and suggests that for other 99 test engines the timeliness score S is very good.\n1For comparison with some of the other benchmarks readily available in literature, see Table 4. It is to be noted that the comparison is not exhaustive as a survey of approaches for the turbofan engine dataset since [31] is not available.\nHI at last cycle and RUL estimation error: Fig. 6(a) shows the actual and estimated RULs for LR-Exp, LR-ED1, and LR-ED2. For all the models, we observe that as the actual RUL increases, the error in predicted values increases. Let R (u∗) all denote the set of all the RUL estimates R̂(u ∗)(u, t) considered to obtain the final RUL estimate R̂(u ∗) (see Eq. 10). Fig. 6(b) shows the average values of absolute error, standard deviation of the elements in R (u∗) all , and the difference of the maximum and the minimum value of the elements in R (u∗) all w.r.t. HI value at last cycle. It suggests that when an instance is close to failure, i.e., HI at last cycle is low, RUL estimate is very accurate with low standard deviation of the elements in R (u∗) all . On the other hand, when an instance is in good health, i.e., when HI at last cycle is close to 1, the error in RUL estimate is high, and the elements in R (u∗) all have high standard deviation."

A snapshot sequence of 9000 points during a run for the 6 dependent sensors is provided. We assume each run to represent one cycle in the life of the tool. We consider two operating regimes corresponding to the two types of material being milled, and learn a different model for each material type. There are a total of 167 runs across cases with 109 runs and 58 runs for material types 1 and 2, respectively. Case number 6 of material 2 has only one run, and hence not considered for experiments.\n6.3.1 Model learning and parameter selection Since number of cases is small, we use leave one out\nmethod for model learning and parameters selection. For training the LSTM-ED model, the first run of each case is considered as normal with sequence length of 9000. An average of the reconstruction error for a run is used to the get the target HI for that run/cycle. We consider mean and standard deviation of each run (9000 values) for the 6 sensors to obtain 2 derived sensors per sensor (similar to [9]). We reduce the gap between two consecutive runs, via linear interpolation, to 1 second (if it is more); as a result HI curves for each case will have a cycle of one second. The tool wear is also interpolated in the same manner and the data for each case is truncated until the point when the tool wear crosses a value of 0.45 for the first time. The target HI from LSTM-ED for the LR model is also interpolated appropriately for learning the LR model.\nThe parameters obtained for the best models (based on minimum MAPE1) for material-1 are p = 1, λ = 0.025, α = 0.98, τ = 15 for PCA1, for material-2 are p = 2, λ = 0.005, α = 0.87, τ = 13, and c = 45 for LR-ED1. The best results are obtained without setting any limit Rmax. For both cases, l = 90 (after downsampling by 100) s.t. the time-series for first run is used for learning the LSTM-ED model.\n6.3.2 Results and observations\nFigs. 7(a) and 7(e) show the variation of average reconstruction error from LSTM-ED w.r.t. the fraction of life passed for both materials. As shown, this error increases with amount of life passed, and hence is an appropriate indicator of health.\nFigs. 7 and 8 show results based on every cycle of the data after interpolation, except when explicitly mentioned in the figure. The performance metrics on the original data points in the data set are summarized in Table 2. We observe that the first PCA component (PCA1, p = 1) gives better results than LR-Lin and LR-Exp models with p ≥ 2, and hence we present results for PCA1 in Table 2. It is to be noted that for p = 1, all the four models LR-Lin, LR-Exp, LR-ED1, and LR-ED2 will give same results since all models will predict a different linearly scaled value of the first PCA component. PCA1 and LR-ED1 are the best models for material-1 and material-2, respectively. We observe that our best models perform well as depicted in histograms in Fig. 7. For the last few cycles, when actual RUL is low, an error of even 1 in RUL estimation leads to MAPE1 of 100%. Figs. 7(b-d), 7(f-h) show the error distributions for different models for the two materials. As can be noted, most of the RUL prediction errors (around 70%) lie in the ranges [-4, 6] and [-3, 1] for material types 1 and 2, respectively. Also, Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) show predicted and actual RULs for different models for the two materials."

      "heading" : "6.4 Pulverizer Mill Dataset",
      "text" : "This dataset consists of readings for 6 sensors (such as bearing vibration, feeder speed, etc.) for over three years of operation of a pulverizer mill. The data corresponds to sensor readings taken every half hour between four consecutive scheduled maintenances M0, M1, M2, and M3, s.t. the operational period between any two maintenances is roughly one year. Each day’s multivariate time-series data with length l = 48 is considered to be one subsequence. Apart from these scheduled maintenances, maintenances are done in between whenever the mill develops any unexpected fault affecting its normal operation. The costs incurred for any of the scheduled maintenances and unexpected maintenances are available. We consider the (z-normalized) original sensor readings directly for analysis rather than computing the PCA based derived sensors.\nWe assume the mill to be healthy for the first 10% of\nthe days of a year between any two consecutive time-based maintenances Mi and Mi+1, and use the corresponding subsequences for learning LSTM-ED models. This data is divided into training and validation sets. A different LSTM-ED model is learnt after each maintenance. The architecture with minimum average reconstruction error over a validation set is chosen as the best model. The best models learnt using data after M0, M1 and M2 are obtained for c = 40, 20, and 100, respectively. The LSTM-ED based reconstruction error for each day is z-normalized using the mean and standard deviation of the reconstruction errors over the sequences in validation set.\nFrom the results in Table 3, we observe that average reconstruction error E on the last day before M1 is the least, and so is the cost C(M1) incurred during M1. For M2 and M3, E as well as corresponding C(Mi) are higher compared to those of M1. Further, we observe that for the days when average value of reconstruction error E > tE , a large fraction (>0.61) of them have a high ongoing maintenance cost C > tC . The significant correlation between reconstruction error and cost incurred suggests that the LSTM-ED based reconstruction error is able to capture the health of the mill."

      "text" : "Similar to our idea of using reconstruction error for modeling normal behavior, variants of Bayesian Networks have been used to model the joint probability distribution over the sensor variables, and then using the evidence probability based on sensor readings as an indicator of normal behaviour (e.g. [11, 35]). [25] presents an unsupervised approach which does not assume a form for the HI curve and uses discrete Bayesian Filter to recursively estimate the health index values, and then use the k-NN classifier to find the most similar offline models. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is used to extrapolate the HI curve if the best class-probability is lesser than a threshold.\nRecent review of statistical methods is available in [31, 36, 15]. We use HI Trajectory Similarity Based Prediction (TSBP) for RUL estimation similar to [40] with the key difference being that the model proposed in [40] relies on exponential assumption to learn a regression model for HI estimation, whereas our approach uses LSTM-ED based HI to learn the regression model. Similarly, [29] proposes RULCLIPPER (RC) which to the best of our knowledge has shown the best performance on C-MAPSS when compared to various approaches evaluated using the dataset [31]. RC tries various combinations of features to select the best set of features and learns linear regression (LR) model over these features to predict health index which is mapped to a HI polygon, and similarity of HI polygons is used instead of univariate curve matching. The parameters of LR model are estimated by assuming exponential target HI (refer Eq. 2). Another variant of TSBP [39] directly uses multiple PCA sensors for multi-dimensional curve matching which is used for RUL estimation, whereas we obtain a univariate HI by taking a weighted combination of the PCA sensors learnt\nusing the unsupervised HI obtained from LSTM-ED as the target HI. Similarly, [20, 19] learn a composite health index based on the exponential assumption.\nMany variants of neural networks have been proposed for prognostics (e.g. [3, 27, 13, 18]): very recently, deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been proposed in [3] and shown to outperform regression methods based on Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Support Vector Regression and Relevance Vector Regression to directly estimate the RUL (see Table 4 for performance comparison with our approach on the Turbofan Engine dataset). The approach uses deep CNNs to learn higher level abstract features from raw sensor values which are then used to directly estimate the RUL, where RUL is assumed to be constant for a fixed number of starting cycles and then assumed to decrease linearly. Similarly, Recurrent Neural Network has been used to directly estimate the RUL [13] from the time-series of sensor readings. Whereas these models directly estimate the RUL, our approach first estimates health index and then uses curve matching to estimate RUL. To the best of our knowledge, our LSTM Encoder-Decoder based approach performs significantly better than Echo State Network [27] and deep CNN based approaches [3] (refer Table 4).\nReconstruction models based on denoising autoencoders [23] have been proposed for novelty/anomaly detection but have not been evaluated for RUL estimation task. LSTM networks have been used for anomaly/fault detection [22, 7, 41], where deep LSTM networks are used to learn prediction models for the normal time-series. The likelihood of the prediction error is then used as a measure of anomaly. These models predict time-series in the future and then use prediction errors to estimate health or novelty of a point. Such models rely on the the assumption that the normal time-series should be predictable, whereas LSTM-ED learns a representation from the entire sequence which is then used to reconstruct the sequence, and therefore does not depend on the predictability assumption for normal time-series."

      "heading" : "8. DISCUSSION",
      "text" : "We have proposed an unsupervised approach to estimate health index (HI) of a system from multi-sensor time-series data. The approach uses time-series instances corresponding to healthy behavior of the system to learn a reconstruction model based on LSTM Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED). We then show how the unsupervised HI can be used for estimating remaining useful life instead of relying on domain knowledge based degradation models. The proposed approach shows promising results overall, and in some cases performs better than models which rely on assumptions about health degradation for the Turbofan Engine and Milling Machine datasets. Whereas models relying on assumptions such as exponential health degradation cannot attune themselves to instance specific behavior, the LSTM-ED based HI uses the temporal history of sensor readings to predict the HI at a point. A case study on real-world industry dataset of a pulverizer mill shows signs of correlation between LSTM-ED based reconstruction error and the cost incurred for maintaining the mill, suggesting that LSTM-ED is able to capture the severity of fault."

However, in many domains degradation may not follow a pattern. We propose a Long Short Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) scheme to obtain an unsupervised health index (HI) for a system using multi-sensor time-series data. LSTM-ED is trained to reconstruct the time-series corresponding to healthy state of a system. The reconstruction error is used to compute HI which is then used for RUL estimation. We evaluate our approach on publicly available Turbofan Engine and Milling Machine datasets. We also present results on a real-world industry dataset from a pulverizer mill where we find significant correlation between LSTM-ED based HI and maintenance costs.",
