      "text" : "Automated first-order theorem provers can aid in the formalization and verification of mathematical theorems and play a crucial role in program analysis, theory reasoning, security, interpolation, and system verification.\nHere we suggest deep learning based guidance in the proof search of the theorem prover E. We train and compare several deep neural network models on the traces of existing ATP proofs of Mizar statements and use them to select processed clauses during proof search. We give experimental evidence that with a hybrid, two-phase approach, deep learning based guidance can significantly reduce the average number of proof search steps while increasing the number of theorems proved.\nUsing a few proof guidance strategies that leverage deep neural networks, we have found first-order proofs of 7.36% of the first-order logic translations of the Mizar Mathematical Library theorems that did not previously have ATP generated proofs. This increases the ratio of statements in the corpus with ATP generated proofs from 56% to 59%."

      "text" : "In the past twenty years, various large corpora of computer-understandable reasoning knowledge have been developed (Harrison et al., 2014). Apart from axioms, definitions, and conjectures, such corpora include proofs derived in the selected logical foundation with sufficient detail to be machine-checkable. This is either given in the form of premises-conclusion pairs (Sutcliffe, 2009) or as procedures and intermediate steps (Wenzel, 1999). The development of many of these formal proofs required dozens of person-years, their sizes are measured in tens of thousands of human-named theorems and the complete proofs contain billions of low-level inference steps.\nThese formal proof libraries are also interesting for AI-based methods, with tasks such as concept matching, theory exploration, and structure formation (Autexier & Hutter, 2015). Furthermore, the AI methods can be augmented by automated reasoning: progress in the development of efficient first-order automated theorem provers (ATPs) (Kovács & Voronkov, 2013) allows applying them not only as tools that redo the formal proofs, but also to find the missing steps (Urban, 2006). Together with proof translations from the richer logics of the interactive systems to the simpler logics of the ATPs this becomes a commonly used tool in certain interactive provers (Blanchette et al., 2016). Many significant proof developments covering both mathematics and computer science have been created using such technologies. Examples include the formal proof of the Kepler conjecture (Hales et al., 2015), or the proof of correctness of the seL4 operating system kernel (Klein et al., 2010).\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n06 97\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 4\nJa n\n20 17\nDespite the completeness of the employed proof calculi, modern ATPs perform poorly in the presence of large fact libraries. For this reason AI-based heuristic and learning techniques are used to preselect lemmas externally (Kühlwein et al., 2012). Even with external selection Alama et al. (2012) show that ATPs are only able to find proofs of up to twenty human steps among the proofs in the Mizar Mathematical Library (Grabowski et al., 2015), whereas the library contains a number of proofs with hundreds of steps. In contrast to external lemma selection, guiding an ATP internally has much better potential as the complete proof state is known. For the tableaux calculus the Machine Learning Connection Prover (MaLeCoP) (Urban et al., 2011) shows that using machine learning to choose the next step can reduce the number of inferences in the proofs on average by a factor of 20. As the most competitive ATPs today are not based on tableau, but instead rely on the superposition calculus, in this paper we investigate guiding the state-of-the-art automated prover E (Schulz, 2013)1 using deep neural networks.\nDeep convolutional neural networks (LeCun et al., 1998) lie at the heart of several recent AI breakthroughs in the past few years. Deep convolutional networks have been instrumental in speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012a) and natural language processing (Kim, 2014). Object recognition has reached human level performance on large benchmarks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2015) due to the inroads of deep convolutional neural networks. DeepMind’s AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) demonstrated superhuman performance in playing the game of Go by utilizing deep convolution neural networks that evaluate board positions. Deep hierarchical convolutional networks have been responsible for vast improvements in speech and sound generation (van den Oord et al., 2016).\nThe wide applicability of deep neural architectures suggest their potential usefulness for guiding the combinatorial search for proofs of mathematical theorems as well."

      "text" : "For the first time, we evaluate deep network models as a proof guidance method inside an automated theorem prover. We describe the technicalities that need to be addressed for a successful integration of relatively slow neural network models in a system that relies on very fast exploration.\nExperimental results are given on a large corpus of mathematical statements translated from the Mizar Mathematical Library (Grabowski et al., 2010) to first-order logic (Urban, 2006) which covers significant parts of basic mathematics ranging from discrete mathematics and mathematical logic to calculus and algebra.\nApplying deep network models inside the proof search process is challenging due to the relatively expensive nature of neural network inference. During the time one clause is evaluated by a neural network (on CPU), several hundreds or thousands of superposition steps may be performed by the prover. This means that proof guidance via neural networks has to provide very good quality suggestions to have a positive effect on the proof process. In this paper we describe two important technical details that were critical for getting improved results with neural network guidance.\nFirst, interleaving network guidance and hard-coded heuristics is still helpful for improving the performance over using the neural network alone to pick the next processed clause.\nSecond, we use a two-phase approach where a network-guided phase is followed by a phase using only fast heuristics. Without this second phase, the network-guided approach often processes only 1% of the clauses of a search with only fast heuristics. While the network-guided phase is slow, its high quality sets up the rest of the search process at a better starting point.\n1Version 1.9.1pre014\nIn essence, if we spend half of the time guiding the search and spend the rest finishing from that starting point, we get significant improvements over lower-quality clause selection that has a higher chance of losing its way in the search process and omitting the selection of crucial clauses that are critical for finishing the proof."

(1999) surveyed learning and knowledge base based approaches to guide automated theorem provers. Schulz (2000) proposed a k-NN based learning methodology with hand-crafted features on a normalized form of the clauses for the selecting the next clause to be processed. Recently, for higher-order logic, naïve Bayes and particle swarm based approaches were proposed for the internal guidance of the givenclause algorithm in Satallax (Färber & Brown, 2016). FEMaLeCoP uses naïve Bayes to guide its tableaux proof search (Kaliszyk & Urban, 2015b). For the theorem prover E, a handengineered similarity function with a few learned weights was proposed for better selection of processed clauses. All these approaches rely on carefully engineered features, whereas our deep learning method learns end-to-end from the textual representation or the syntax tree of the proof clauses.\nRecently, there have been several attempts to apply deep learning to theorem proving and reasoning in general. Convolutional neural networks were used successfully for premise selection in Mizar (Alemi et al., 2016), and we use similar models for proof guidance here. Whalen (2016) proposed a complete neural network based theorem prover architecture leveraging GRU (Chung et al., 2015) networks to guide the proof search of a tableau style proof process for the MetaMath system (Megill, 2007). A fully differential theorem prover was tested on a few toy problems by Rocktäschel & Riedel (2016). Entailment analysis via deep learning was proposed by Rocktäschel et al. (2015)."

      "text" : "We target the saturation-based first-order logic theorem prover E (Schulz, 2013). E preprocesses all inputs into clausal normal form (CNF) and conducts the proof search in this form. A firstorder formula is in CNF if it is a conjunction of clauses where each clause is a disjunction of literals, where each literal is a (possibly negated) application of an k-ary predicate symbol to k terms, and where the terms are recursively either variables or functions applied to terms.\nE’s proof search is parametrized by variety of arguments, the most important of which is the clause selection heuristic which we focus on in this work. In saturation-based theorem proving two sets of clauses are manipulated: a set of unprocessed clauses initialized to the clausal form of the problem and an initially empty set of processed clauses. At each step the heuristic chooses one of the unprocessed clauses, generates all its consequences (adding them to the set of unprocessed clauses), then moves the clause into the processed clauses set. The order in which the heuristic processes the clauses greatly impacts how long it will take before a proof is found. E’s auto mode inspects a problem and selects a clause search heuristic and other parameters likely to perform well.\nThe most successful heuristics in E are hybrid heuristics that select the next clause by targeting different criteria in a round-robin fashion. For example, a simplistic hybrid heuristic\nmight alternate between selecting clauses in a FIFO ordering and selecting the shortest clause from the set of unprocessed clauses. These two heuristics in isolation may miss selecting important clauses, but improve significantly when used in combination. The E prover implements hybrid heuristics by maintaining a separate ranking of all unprocessed clauses for each of the selection criteria. It then processes the top clause from each ranking, allowing for an arbitrary interleaving of selection criteria.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that, given fixed time and memory limits, we can prove more statements when we add machine learning based classification to the clause selection heuristic."

The MML is today one of the largest libraries of formalized proofs, covering most basic domains of mathematics and some computer science proofs. The foundations of Mizar have been translated to first-order logic by Urban (2006) making MML the first target for experiments combining machine learning with automated reasoning. The most extensive evaluation of AI-ATP methods on the library has been performed by Kaliszyk & Urban (2015a) on MML version 4.181.1147. The set of 57,882 Mizar theorems translated to first-order logic has been chronologically ordered together with about 90,000 other formulas (mostly to express Mizar’s type system).\nThe first-order problems used to guide E prover in this paper are all distinct proofs found in Kaliszyk & Urban (2015a). This includes both proofs based on the human dependencies that the ATPs can redo and proofs found by running the ATPs on the predicted dependencies. Of the 57,882 Mizar theorems in FOL, 32,521 (about 56%) of them have at least one ATP proof with a total of 91,877 distinct ATP proofs.\nWe use these 91,877 proofs to train and evaluate our neural networks. We randomly assign them by conjecture into a training and a validation set using a 90%-10% split. By splitting the proofs by conjecture, we avoid contamination of our evaluation set. If one conjecture has multiple proofs, then all of those proofs are assigned to the training set, or all are assigned to the evaluation set. The training set contains 82,718 unique proofs of 29,325 conjectures. The remaining 3,196 conjectures and their 9,159 proofs are assigned to the evaluation set. When we evaluate clause selection heuristics over this evaluation set, we refer to them as the easy statements, since they have previously been proved by some ATP method. We call the 25,361 conjectures for which no ATP proof has been found the hard statements. These theorems taken together comprise the 57,882 Mizar theorems in FOL."

      "text" : "Here we describe the data collection, network architectures, and training methodology of our deep learning models to be incorporated into the proof search procedure of the automated theorem prover E by Schulz (2013).\nWe have reused several architectural and training choices that proved successful in the earlier related premise selection work by Alemi et al. (2016). Our models have two inputs: a negated conjecture to be proved and an unprocessed clause, both in CNF. Each is reduced to a fixed size vector using an embedding network, and a combiner network combines the two embedding vectors into a score for use as a clause selection heuristic. Ideally, the score would depend on the current set of processed clauses, but we have restricted the inputs to negated conjecture\nand clause for simplicity and speed. Thus, the overall architecture is\nvc = femb(clause, wc) vnc = femb(negated-conjecture, wnc)\np(useful|c, nc) = σ(gcomb(vc, vnc, wcomb))\nwhere femb and gcomb are the embedding and combiner networks, wc, wnc, and wcomb are the weights to be learned, and σ(z) = 1/(1 + e−z) is sigmoid (Figure 1, left). Note that we use the same architecture to embed both negated conjecture and clause, but with different learned weights.\nAt training time, the output probabilities are trained using logistic loss towards p = 1 if the clause was used in the proof, and towards p = 0 otherwise. At proof time, the unprocessed clause with maximum probability is chosen to be processed.\nFor the embedding network femb, we have tried three architectures:\n1. A simple convolutional network with a few convolutional layers followed by max-pooling.\n2. A WaveNet (van den Oord et al., 2016) style network that can effectively model long range dependencies.\n3. Recursive neural networks (Goller & Kuchler, 1996) whose topology depends on the syntax tree of the formula to be evaluated.\nIn sections 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5, we give a detailed description of the models evaluated and compare their predictive performance after describing the training and evaluation data in section 4.1. The end-to-end system was only evaluated using the fastest models and those with very good prediction performance.

This means that the layer weights are learned jointly for the same formula, as they tend to contain multiple instances of the node of the same type.\nAt the leaves of the tree, we have the constants that can represent functions of various arity. These symbols have their associated embeddings which are initialized randomly and learned together with the rest of the network.\nEach of these internal nodes are represented by either a fully connected layer with ReLU activation or tree LSTM network (Tai et al., 2015). They aggregate the fixed size children and output a vector that has the length of the pre-set output embedding size (or two vectors for tree\nLSTMs). Our tree LSTMs use separate forget gains per input and include off-diagonal forget gate terms (see Figure 3 and Tai et al.

For this, we use a corpus of 25,361 theorems from Mizar for which no proof was found in Kaliszyk & Urban (2015a).

With a good heuristic, a proof may be found in a relatively small number of search steps. In this section, we use the models from Section 5.1 with the highest accuracy as the clause selection heuristic inside of E.2 These models, which are trained to select clauses that are most likely to contribute to a proof, now assign a score to each unprocessed clause, namely the trained value of p(useful|c,nc). In other words, the probability that a clause\n2Due to its huge memory footprint, we were unable to experiment with WaveNet-1024 in E prover.\nc, is used in the final proof, given the set of negated conjectures nc. E prover uses this score to rank the set of unprocessed clauses, then at each step processes the clause that has the best ranking.3 Since many new unprocessed clauses are generated when each clause is processed, this selection order is crucial. A good clause selection heuristic can be the difference between finding a proof after a small number of search steps, and finding a proof only after years of computation time.\nWhile our ultimate goal is to develop a heuristic that is powerful enough to prove the challenging statements that don’t yet have an ATP proof, experimenting on this dataset is computationally very expensive. Instead, we kept a holdout set of 9,159 statements which we did not use as training data. These statements already have existing ATP proofs and tend to be computationally less intensive, so we can use this holdout set to run more experiments and directly compare with proofs generated by an existing Auto strategy, which we selected as the best-performing strategy on this dataset as discussed in the appendix.\nIn this section, we find that deep neural nets, which are computationally very expensive even when used for inference, are most effective when used in combination with existing heuristics. We also use the holdout set to investigate which of the model architectures presented in Section 4 are most effective."

      "text" : "In our experiments, we found that our computation heavy neural networks did much better when they were used in concert with existing, fast heuristics. In this section, we present different approaches to using neural networks to guide existing heuristics.\n1. The Auto heuristic is standard in E (see appendix). This approach is already a hybrid of several weighting functions and tuned parameters, but does not include any inference from a deep neural network.\n2. A pure neural network heuristic scores the clauses using only the trained neural network. This approach is slow, as it must evaluate all clauses with the expensive neural network. It also can not take advantage of ranking based on different heuristics, as the Auto function does, and we observe that it does not perform well on its own.\n3. A hybrid approach alternates between deep network based guidance and the fast Auto heuristic. This augments the standard clause selection methods with additional neural network suggested clauses. While this process still can do relatively few proof search steps due to the slowness of the neural network evaluations, which must still be done on all unprocessed clauses to obtain a rank ordering.\n4. A switched approach, which uses deep network guidance in the first phase of the computation (either pure or hybrid). As time resources begin to run out, we switch to Auto, a traditional complete search phase, which can process a lot of clauses without the overhead of the deep network guidance.\nFigure 4 left shows a direct comparison of these approaches to proof guidance using a simple CNN in all cases. Not surprisingly, the pure CNN does not perform well on its own; however, when we allow E prover to alternate between the CNN heuristic and the Auto heuristic, the hybrid outperforms both the Auto and CNN heuristics for lower limits on the processed clauses. Still, because the hybrid approach has all the overhead of the deep network evaluation, we see this hybrid method bottoms out after around 7,500 processed clauses, due to a lack of resources.\n3E prover uses a lowest-is-best ordering, so in implementation we use −p(useful|c, nc).\nThe best of the guidance approaches we explored was the switched approach, which uses the Auto heuristic to avoid running out of resources at a relatively small number of processed clauses. The intuition behind this is that we expect the standard heuristics to be too weak to avoid combinatorial explosion while neural network guidance is still too slow on current hardware. If we run a guided proof search alone for awhile, it could end up selecting all the essential clauses for the proof, but it might fail to close to proof due to its slowness. Our “switched” approach gives a cure to this shortfall of the network guided approach.\nThroughout the remainder of this paper, all the proof guidance methods employ the twophase “switched” approach that first runs a hybrid network-guided phases for 20 minutes, followed by a standard heuristics-based phase for 10 minutes."

Given that we do not use special hardware for this purpose, our proof search is completely dominated by the deep network evaluation.\nIf the number of premises is very high in the beginning, there is a much bigger hit on the deep network guided proof search due to the larger number of clauses evaluations per step. This motivates the use of additional premise selection as an important additional component.\nStill, we first present a baseline without premise selection and show that the relatively fast premise selection phase is critical for good performance on the hard theorems with or without deep network guidance. In the second subsection, we turn on premise selection and compare various proof guidance models against the baseline auto heuristic."

      "text" : "Here we start with a comparison of four different approaches on the hard statements. These include guided and unguided proof search with and without premise selection.\nFor premise selection, we use the character level model from the DeepMath paper (Alemi et al., 2016). The model is a very similar model to our convolutional proof guidance model, but was trained on premise-conclusion pairs from a training set that was randomly chosen from the 56% ATP-proved statements. One main difference is that our proof guidance convolutional network is word level with an embedding learned for each token, whereas the premise selection network takes character sequences as input. This limits quality, as the DeepMath paper suggests that using a word level model with definitional embeddings gives the best results. We have opted for the lower quality character level premise selection model for simplicity.\nAfter premise selection we run four proof attempts: first the premises are ranked by the model scores and the top 32, 64, 128, and 256 different premises selected (as long as the original number of premises is not exceeded). We run E prover using the selected set of premises as long as it does not find a proof. We stop searching for a proof when a proof is found for any subset of the premises.\nThe experimental results are given in Table 3. We give experimental evidence that the switched approach outperforms the unguided proof search. We have tested two different premise selection models to get a feel for the variability and complementarity of the results. It turns out that different premise selection models even with the same architecture can introduce a lot of variations that can lead to different number of theorems proved, but can result in choices that complement each other well and help the proof search process by increasing the diversity of starting set of premises."

      "text" : "All the proof guidance methods employed the two-phase approach that first runs a hybrid network-guided phases for 20 minutes, followed by a standard heuristics based phase for 10 minutes.\nHere we tried two different premise selection models “DeepMath 1” and “DeepMath 2” using the same character level convolutional architecture as the best character level model described in (Alemi et al., 2016). This way, we can evaluate the stability of result with respect to the premise selection strategy. One can see that although the two models are trained the same way and have comparable quality, they result in significantly different sets of theorems proved, but\nthe number of theorems proved using both models is very similar and the “switch” strategy using the simpler CNN performed best for both premise selection and proof guidance by a significant margin.\nThe experimental results are given in Table 4. The CNN models use a simple three layer convolutional networks to rank the unprocessed clauses while the WaveNet models use the WaveNet architecture which is significantly slower to evaluate, but produced better proxy metrics on the holdout set. Note that the simple convolutional network based approach proves 86% more theorems than the unguided approach (4.34% versus 2.33% of the hard statements). The overall number the statements proved by any means in this paper (including the use of non-switched neural guidance) is 1,866 which is 7.36% of all the hard statements."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have demonstrated the feasibility of guiding first-order logic proof search by augmenting the given clause selection method with ranking by deep neural networks. With a properly engineered mixture of neural guidance and hand-crafted search strategies, we get significant improvements in first-order logic prover performance, especially for theorems that are harder and require deeper search.\nDue to the slowness of neural network evaluation, our method leads to an increased number of successful proofs only if we utilize it in a two-phase approach where a deep network guided phase is followed by a faster combinatorial search with given clauses selected quickly using the existing hand-crafted clause selection strategies.\nAdditionally, we established that both the prediction accuracy of the deep network and its speed are important for increased proving power. For example, our WaveNet model yields higher accuracy on the holdout set than a simple convolutional network, but due to its much higher computational cost, when used as a clause scorer in E prover, it still proves fewer theorems under the same time constraints than the cheaper but lower quality convolutional network.\nCurrently our approach is computationally expensive, and we allow 30 minutes per proof compared to 15 minutes for previous work. However, this extra time does not significantly help existing heuristics unless combined with neural proof guidance (see appendix). This suggests\nthat the neural guidance represents a substantial improvement in constraining the search space. Moreover, we expect that the inroads of specialized hardware for deep learning will mitigate much of the computational overhead. This would allow higher performing models to play their strength with dramatic efficiency and quality gains in the future.\nOur approach is just the first step of applying deep learning to guiding combinatorial search processes and it is arguable that working with a purely syntactic input format the derived set of features is not strong enough to create a semantically relevant representation of mathematical content. Besides improving theorem proving, our approach has the exciting potential to generate higher quality training data for systems that study the behavior of formulas under a set of logical transformations. This could enable learning representation of formulas in ways that consider the semantics not just the syntactic properties of mathematical content and can make decisions based on their behavior during proof search."

Automated first-order theorem provers can aid in the formalization and verification of mathematical theorems and play a crucial role in program analysis, theory reasoning, security, interpolation, and system verification. Here we suggest deep learning based guidance in the proof search of the theorem prover E. We train and compare several deep neural network models on the traces of existing ATP proofs of Mizar statements and use them to select processed clauses during proof search. We give experimental evidence that with a hybrid, two-phase approach, deep learning based guidance can significantly reduce the average number of proof search steps while increasing the number of theorems proved. Using a few proof guidance strategies that leverage deep neural networks, we have found first-order proofs of 7.36% of the first-order logic translations of the Mizar Mathematical Library theorems that did not previously have ATP generated proofs. This increases the ratio of statements in the corpus with ATP generated proofs from 56% to 59%.",
