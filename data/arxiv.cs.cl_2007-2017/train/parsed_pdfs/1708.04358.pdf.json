      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Geolocation is an essential component of applications such as traffic monitoring (Emadi et al., 2017), human mobility pattern analysis (McNeill et al., 2016; Dredze et al., 2016) and disaster response (Ashktorab et al., 2014; Wakamiya et al., 2016), as well as targeted advertising (Anagnostopoulos et al., 2016) and local recommender systems (Ho et al., 2012). Although Twitter provides users with the means to geotag their messages, less than 1% of users opt to turn on geotagging, so thirdparty service providers tend to use profile data, text content and network information to infer the location of users. Text content is the most widely used source of geolocation information, due to its prevalence across social media services.\nText-based geolocation systems use the geographical bias of language to infer the location of a user or message using models trained on geotagged posts. The models often use a representation of text (e.g. based on a bag-of-words, convolutional or recurrent model) to predict the location either in real-valued latitude/longitude coordinate space or\nin discretised region-based space, using regression or classification, respectively. Regression models, as a consequence of minimising squared loss for a unimodal distribution, predict inputs with multiple targets to lie between the targets (e.g. a user who mentions content in both NYC and LA is predicted to be in the centre of the U.S.). Classification models, while eliminating this problem by predicting a more granular target, don’t provide fine-grained predictions (e.g. specific locations in NYC), and also require heuristic discretisation of locations into regions (e.g. using clustering).\nMixture Density Networks (“MDNs”: Bishop (1994)) alleviate these problems by representing location as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. Given a text input, an MDN can generate a mixture model in the form of a probability distribution over all location points. In the example of a user who talks about both NYC and LA, e.g., the model will predict a strong Gaussian component in NYC and another one in LA, and also provide an estimate of uncertainty over all the coordinate space.\nAlthough MDNs are not new, they have not found widespread use in inverse regression problems where for a single input, multiple correct outputs are possible. Given the integration of NLP technologies into devices (e.g. phones or robots with natural language interfaces) is growing quickly, there is a potential need for interfacing language with continuous variables as input or target. MDNs can also be used in general text regression problems such as risk assessment (Wang and Hua, 2014), sentiment analysis (Joshi et al., 2010) and loan rate prediction (Bitvai and Cohn, 2015), not only to improve prediction but also to use the mixture model as a representation for the continuous variables. We apply MDNs to geotagged Twitter data in two different settings: (a) predicting location given text; and (b) predicting text given location. ar X iv :1\n70 8.\n04 35\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n4 A\nug 2\n01 7\nGeotagged text content is not only useful in geolocation, but can also be used in lexical dialectology. Lexical dialectology is (in part) the converse of text-based geolocation (Eisenstein, 2015): instead of predicting location from language, language (e.g. dialect terms) are predicted from a given location. This is a much more challenging task as the lexical items are not known beforehand, and there is no notion of dialect regions in the continuous space of latitude/longitude coordinates. A lexical dialectology model should not only be able to predict dialect terms but also be able to automatically learn dialect regions.\nIn this work, we use bivariate Gaussian mixtures over geotagged Twitter data in two different settings, and demonstrate their use for geolocation and lexical dialectology. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a continuous representation of location using bivariate Gaussian mixtures; (2) we show that our geolocation model outperforms regression-based models and achieves comparable results with classification models, but with added uncertainty over the continuous output space; (3) we show that our lexical dialectology model is able to predict geographical dialect terms from latitude/longitude input with state-of-the-art accuracy; and (4) we show that the automatically learned Gaussian regions match expert-generated dialect regions of the U.S.1"

      "text" : "Text-based geolocation models are defined as either a regression or a classification problem. In regression geolocation, the model learns to predict a real-valued latitude/longitude from a text input. This is a very challenging task for data types such as Twitter, as they are often heavily biased toward population centres and urban areas, and far from uniform. As an example, Norwalk is the name of a few cities in the U.S among which Norwalk, California (West Coast) and Norwalk, Connecticut (East Coast) are the two most populous cities. Assuming that occurrences of the city’s name are almost equal in both city regions within the training set, a trained regression-based geolocation model given Norwalk as input, would geolocate it to a point in the middle of the U.S. instead of choosing one of the cities. In the machine learning literature,\n1Code available at https://github.com/afshinrahimi/geomdn\nregression problems where there are multiple realvalued outputs for a given input are called inverse problems (Bishop, 1994). Here, standard regression models predict an average point in the middle of all training target points to minimise squared error loss. Bishop (1994) proposes density mixture networks to model such inverse problems, as we discuss in detail in Section 3.\nIn addition, non-Bayesian interpretations of regression models, which are often used in practice, don’t produce any prediction of uncertainty, so other than the predicted point, we have little idea where else the term could have high or low probability. Priedhorsky et al. (2014) propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) approach instead of squared loss regression, whereby they learn a mixture of bivariate Gaussian distributions for each individual n-gram in the training set. During prediction, they add the Gaussian mixture of each ngram in the input text, resulting in a new Gaussian mixture which can be used to predict a coordinate with associated uncertainty. To add the mixture components they use a weighted sum, where the weight of each n-gram is assigned by several heuristic features. Learning a GMM for each n-gram is resource-intensive if the size of the training set — and thus the number of n-grams — is large.\nAssuming sufficient training samples containing the term Norwalk in the two main, a trained classification model would, given this term as input, predict a probability distribution over all regions, and assign higher probabilities to the regions containing the two major cities. The challenge, though, is that the coordinates in the training data must first be partitioned into regions using administrative regions (Cheng et al., 2010; Hecht et al., 2011; Kinsella et al., 2011; Han et al., 2012, 2014), a uniform grid (Serdyukov et al., 2009), or a clustering method such as a k-d tree (Wing and Baldridge, 2011) or K-means (Rahimi et al., to appear). The cluster/region labels can then be used as targets. Once we have a prediction about where a user is more likely to be from, there is no more information about the coordinates inside the predicted region. If a region that contains Wyoming is predicted as the home location of a user, we have no idea which city or county within Wyoming the user might be from, unless we retrain the model using a more fine-grained discretisation or a hierarchical discretisation (Wing and Baldridge, 2014), which is both time-consuming and challenging due to data\nsparseness."

      "heading" : "2.2 Lexical Dialectology",
      "text" : "The traditional linguistic approach to lexical dialectology is to find the geographical distributions of known contrast sets such as {you, yall, yinz}: (Labov et al., 2005; Nerbonne et al., 2008; Gonçalves and Sánchez, 2014; Doyle, 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Nguyen and Eisenstein, to appear). This usually involves surveying a large geographically-uniform sample of people from different locations and analysing where each known alternative is used more frequently. Then, the coordinates are clustered heuristically into dialect regions, based on the lexical choices of users in each region relative to the contrast set. This processing is very costly and time-consuming, and relies critically on knowing the lexical alternatives a priori. For example, it would require a priori knowledge of the fact that people in different regions of the US use pop and soda to refer to the same type of drink, and a posteriori analysis of the empirical geographical distribution of the different terms. Language, particularly in social media and among younger speakers, is evolving so quickly, in ways that can be measured over large-scale data samples such as Twitter, that we ideally want to be able to infer such contrast sets dynamically. The first step in automatically collecting dialect words is to find terms that are disproportionately distributed in different locations. The two predominant approaches to this problem are model-based (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2013; Eisenstein, 2015) and through the use of statistical metrics (Monroe et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2014). Model-based approaches use a topic model, e.g., to extract region-specific topics, and from this, predict the probability of seeing a word given a geographical region (Eisenstein et al., 2010). However, there are scalability issues, limiting the utility of such models.\nIn this paper, we propose a neural network architecture that learns a mixture of Gaussian distributions as its activation function, and predicts both locations from word-based inputs (geolocation), and words from location-based inputs (lexical dialectology)."

The probability mass function of a Gaussian mixture model is given by:\nP(x) = K ∑\nk=1\nπkN (x|µk,Σk)\nwhere ∑K\nk=1 πk = 1, and the number of components K is a hyper-parameter.\n3.3 Mixture Density Network (MDN)\nA mixture density network (“MDN”: Bishop (1994)) is a latent variable model where the conditional probability of p(y|x) is modelled as a mixture of K Gaussians where the mixing coefficients π and the parameters of Gaussian distributions µ and Σ are computed as a function of input using a neural network:\nP(y|x) = K ∑\nk=1\nπk(x)N ( y|µk(x),Σk(x) )\nIn the bivariate case of latitude/longitude, the number of parameters of each Gaussian is 6 (πk(x), µ1k(x), µ2k(x), ρk(x),σ1k(x),σ2k(x)), which are learnt in the output layer of a regular neural network as a function of input x. The output size of the network for K components would be 6 × K. The output of an MDN for N samples (e.g. where N is the mini-batch size) is an N × 6K matrix which is then sliced and reshaped into (N × 2 × K), (N × 2 × K), (N × 1 × K)\nand (N × 1 × K) matrices, providing the model parameters µ, σ, ρ and π. Each parameter type has its own constraints: σ (the standard deviation) should be positive, ρ (the correlation) should be in the interval [−1, 1] and π should be positive and sum to one, as a probability distribution. To force these constraints, the following transformations are often applied to each parameter set:\nσ ∼ SoftPlus(σ′) = log(exp(σ′) + 1) ∈ (0,+∞)\nπ ∼ SoftMax(π′)\nρ ∼ SoftSign(ρ′) = ρ′\n1 + |ρ′| ∈ [−1, 1]\nAs an alternative, it’s possible to use transformations like exp for σ and tanh for ρ. After applying the transformations to enforce the range constraints, the negative log likelihood loss of each sample x given a 2d coordinate label y is computed as:\nL(y|x) = − log\n{ K ∑\nk=1\nπk(x)N ( y|µk(x),Σk(x) )\n}\nTo predict a location, given an unseen input, the output of the network is reshaped into a mixture of Gaussians and µk, one of the K components’ µ is chosen as the prediction. The selection criteria is either based on the strongest component with highest π, or the component that maximises the overall mixture probability:\nmax µi∈{µ1...µK}\nK ∑\nk=1\nπkN (µi|µk,Σk)\nFor further details on selection criteria, see Bishop (1994)."

As a result, it might be a difficult task for the model to learn all the parameters of each sample correctly. Instead of using the output to predict all the parameters, we share µ and Σ among all samples as parameters of the output layer, and only use the input to predict π, the mixture probabilities, using a SoftMax layer. We\ninitialise µ by applying K-means clustering to the training coordinates and setting each value of µ to the centroids of the K clusters; we initialise Σ randomly between 0 and 10. We use the original cost function to update the weight matrices, biases and the global shared parameters of the mixture model through backpropagation. Prediction is performed in the same way as for MDN."

      "text" : "Gaussian mixtures are usually used as the output layer in neural networks (as in MDN) for inverse regression problems. We extend their application by using them as an input representation when the input is a multidimensional continuous variable. In problems such as lexical dialectology, the input is real-valued 2d coordinates, and the goal is to predict dialect words from a given location. Small differences in latitude/longitude may result in big shifts in language use (e.g. in regions such as Switzerland or Gibraltar). One way to model this is to discretise the input space (similar to the discretisation of the output space in classification), with the significant downside that the model is not able to learn/fine-tune regions in a data-driven way. A better solution is to use a K component Gaussian mixture representation of location, where µ and Σ are shared among all samples, and the output of the layer is the probability of input in each of the mixture components. Note that in this representation, there is no need for π parameters as we just need to represent the association of an input location to K regions, which will then be used as input to the next layer of a neural network and used to predict the targets. We use this continuous representation of location to predict dialect words from location input."

The output is the collection of Gaussian mixture parameters (µ,Σ,π) from MDN. For prediction, the µk of the mixture component which has the highest probability within the mixture component is selected. In the case of MDN-SHARED, the output is only π, a vector with size K, but the output layer contains extra global parameters µ and Σ (σlat,σlon, ρ) which are shared between all the samples. The negative log likelihood objective is optimised using Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) and early stopping is used to prevent overfitting. The hidden layer is subject to drop-out and elastic net regularisation (with equal l1 and l2 shares). As our baseline, we used a multilayer perceptron regressor with the same input and hidden architecture but with a 2d output with linear activation that predicts the location from text input. The regularisation and drop-out rate, hidden layer size and the number of Gaussian components K (for MDN and MDN-SHARED) are tuned over the development set of each dataset, as shown in Table 1.\nWe evaluate the predictions of the geolocation models based on three measures (following Cheng et al.

For a user label, we use an l1 normalised bag-of-words representation of its text content and use binary tf and idf for term-weighting. The model should learn to predict the probability distribution over the vocabulary and so be capable of predicting dialect words with a higher probability. It also learns regions (parameters of K Gaussians) that represent dialect regions.\nWe evaluate the lexical dialectology model (MDN-layer) using perplexity of the predicted unigram distribution, and compare it with a baseline where the Gaussian mixture layer is replaced with a tanh hidden layer (tanh-layer). Also we retrieve words given points within a region from the DAREDS dataset, and measure recall with respect to relevant dialect terms from DAREDS. To do that, we randomly sample P = 10000 latitude/longitude points from the training set and predict the corresponding word distribution. To come up with a ranking over words given region r as query, we use the following measure:\nscore(wi|r) = 1\nN\n∑\npj∈r\nlog(P (wi|pj))\n− 1\nP\nP ∑\nj=1\nlog(P (wi|pj))\nwhere N equals the number of points (out of 10000) inside the query dialect region r and P equals the total number of points (here 10000). For example, if we are querying dialect terms from dialect region South (r), N is the number of randomly selected points that fall within the constituent states of South. score(wi|r) measures the (log) probability ratio of a word wi inside region r compared to its global score: if a word is local to region r, the ratio will be higher.

We showed that when a global structure exists (e.g. population centres, in the case of geolocation) it is better to share the global parameters of the mixture model to improve generalisation. In this work, we used the bivariate Gaussian distribution in the MDN’s mixture leaving the use of other distributions which might better suit the geolocation task for future research."
