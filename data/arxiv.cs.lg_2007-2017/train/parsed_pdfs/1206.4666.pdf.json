      "text" : "Joint diagonalization is a technique to simultaneously diagonalize a series of K square symmetric matrices C = {Ck}Kk=1 where Ck ∈ RN×N (Friedland, 1983; Cardoso & Souloumiac, 1996; Pham, 2001;\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nvan der Veen, 2001; Yeredor, 2002; Ziehe et al., 2004; Souloumiac, 2009). The standard joint diagonalization scheme finds a common matrix W ∈ RN×N such that WCkW\nT for all k are diagonal matrices. There are various applications for the joint diagonalization technique, such as blind source separation (BSS) (Belouchrani et al., 1997; Yeredor, 2002; Ziehe et al., 2004), common principal component analysis (CPCA) (Flury, 1984), and common spatial pattern analysis (CSPA) (Koles, 1991; Blankertz et al., 2008). However, it is well known that for more than two matrices it may not be possible to achieve joint diagonalization exactly and one must resort to approximate joint diagonalization for such applications. Furthermore, for some applications such as BSS, the matrices Ck may not even be symmetric.\nIn this paper, we generalize the standard joint diagonalization scheme by proposing an underlying statistical model. Rather than directly seeking W, we infer a global matrix B ∈ RN×M , which is not necessarily square, and a series of K diagonal matrices Λ = {Λk}Kk=1 where Λk = diag(λk1 , λk2 , · · · , λkM ) are the eigenvalues for every k\nCk = BΛkB T + Ek (1)\nwhere Ek = (e k 1 , e k 2 , · · · , ekN ) are assumed errors. A Gaussian error model ekn ∼ N (0, σ2kI) is assumed, therefore each element ekij of Ek follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance σ2k. We note that in this formulation the matrices Ck may not be symmetric. In this paper we restrict ourselves to the case BTB = I, however further work could consider the case where B is non-orthogonal (Yeredor, 2002; Ziehe et al., 2004; Souloumiac, 2009). The columns of B are then recognized as the common eigenvectors.\nThis model is a generalization of the subspace fitting models of (van der Veen, 2001; Yeredor, 2002), where here the errors Ek are represented explicitly.\nVarious joint diagonalization algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The Jacobi method of (Cardoso & Souloumiac, 1996) seeks an orthogonal matrix W for jointly diagonalizing Ck whilst Pham’s algorithm (Pham, 2001) is restricted to positive definite matrices Ck. Compared to these methods, our method is not restricted to positive definite Ck furthermore B could be a non-square matrix. Our approach is most similar to the subspace fitting models (van der Veen, 2001; Yeredor, 2002) although we also treat the error variances as parameters to be inferred. Flurry (Flury, 1984) and Hoff (Hoff, 2009b) proposed CPCA for a series of covariance matrices whose eigenvalues were assumed positive, a restriction which we relax.\nPoint estimate methods such as the expectationmaximisation (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) or the AC-DC algorithm (Yeredor, 2002) could be derived to estimate these parameters. In this paper we prefer a Bayesian formulation for the model (1) where the posterior distributions for parameters is provided. A Gibbs sampler is derived to simulate model parameters from their posterior distribution. Based on some data, we compared the Gibbs sampler to the Jacobi method (Cardoso & Souloumiac, 1996), AC-DC (Yeredor, 2002) and the FFDiag algorithm (Ziehe et al., 2004). Across all the results the Gibbs sampler is comparable to both the Jacobi and FFDiag methods whilst outperforming the AC-DC algorithm in terms of the Amari performance index (Amari et al., 1996)."

This distribution is defined under the uniform measure dSM−1(x) in the sphere SM−1. The uniform measure dSM−1(x) is invariant under the orthogonal transformation. Therefore, for any orthogonal matrix Γ ∈ O(M), set y = ΓTx, then y has a Bing-\nham distribution p(y|ΓTΣΓ) with respect to the uniform measure in SM−1.

We calculated the ESS for the three sampling schemes which are shown in the Table 2. We see that both the rejection and slice sampling are more efficient than the grid sampling in terms of ESS. We also plotted the log likelihood for the three schemes (see Figure 2), which shows that the grid sampling scheme performs better than the other two in searching for the modes of the model. We now employ the grid sampling scheme for the model when\nN > M . The ESS of grid sampling was very small, which suggests that grid sampling may be performing a random walk in the local mode of the posterior.\nSince our model is similar to that of (Yeredor, 2002), we compare grid sampling to the AC-DC algorithm. Both the grid sampling and AC-DC algorithm were applied to the data to infer B and Λk. We calculated the API values for the estimates from both methods when various errors were added to the model. The API statistics for grid sampling and the minimum API values for the AC-DC algorithm are shown in the Table 3. Note that we also show the API computed by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sample. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the AC-DC algorithm across all error levels. We note here that one of the advantages of the Bayesian approach compared to point estimate methods is that the sampling approach accommodates naturally the model selection issue. As the first step to model selection, we used the Gibbs sampling output to approximate the log marginal likelihood of various models using the BIC (Schwarz, 1978). We calculated the log marginal likelihood for the models M = 1, 2, · · · , N where M denotes the number of columns of B. The estimates are shown in the Figure 3 which indicates that BIC prefers M = 5 which correctly located the model.

The data used for this study corresponds to the EEG data set IIIb of the BCI competition III (Blankertz et al., 2006). This data set gathers the EEG signals recorded for three subjects who had to perform motor imagery, i.e. to imagine\nleft or right hand movements. Hence, the two classes to be identified were Left and Right. Before doing the CSPA, we extract features from these EEG signals. We choose to use Band Power (BP) features and finally we have four features for each subject which are denoted as C3-α, C3-β, C4-α and C4-β. So each data point having four features is labeled as one of the two classes. We do the CSPA for these data points. We denote the two class data as X1 and X2. In the first step we whitened the data by using a whitening matrix W as usual. Then we form the sample covariance matrices C1 and C2 for the two classes, respectively. Note that the covariance matrix has size 4 × 4. Then the Gibbs sampler was used to seek an orthogonal matrix B to diagonalize the covariance matrices simultaneously. Finally the filtered data of the two classes are then X̃1 = BTWX1 and X̃2 = BTWX2. For demonstration, we plotted the scatter plots for the features C4-α and C4-β before filtering and after filtering (see Figure 5). From the plots in Figure 5 (a), we see that the data in the two classes have large variance in the same direction, and after the filtering in Figure 5 (b) they have large variances in opposite directions. This can also be demonstrated by the inferred eigenvalues plotted in Figure 6, where the squares denote the eigenvalues for one class and circles for the other. We observe that one class has larger eigenvalues in features C3-α and C4-α and the other class has larger eigenvalues in features C3-β and C4-β. This would be useful for the further classification purpose. It is interesting to note that the sample covariance matrices are positive definite matrices, and thus the inferred eigenvalues finally converged to positive values even though they were initialized in negative values. This could be an advantage for our Gibbs sampler comparing to the algorithms of (Hoff, 2009b) and (Pham, 2001) where the eigenvalues were restricted to positive values."

Several synthetic examples are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed Gibbs sampler and we then provide comparisons to several other joint diagonalization algorithms, which shows that the Gibbs sampler achieves the state-of-theart performance on the examples considered. As a byproduct, the output of the Gibbs sampler could be used to estimate the log marginal likelihood, however we employ the approximation based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) which in the synthetic examples considered correctly located the number of common eigenvectors. We then succesfully applied the sampler to the source separation problem as well as the common principal component analysis and the common spatial pattern analysis problems.",
