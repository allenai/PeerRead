      "text" : "Deep learning based methods learn low-dimensional, real-valued vectors for word tokens, mostly from large-scale data corpus (e.g., [1, 2, 3]), successfully capturing capturing syntactic and semantic aspects of text.\nFor tasks where the inputs are larger text units (e.g., phrases, sentences or documents), a convolutional model is first needed to aggregate tokens into a vector with fixed dimensionality that can be used as a feature for other NLP tasks. Model for achieving this usually fall into two categories: recurrent models and recursive models:\nRecurrent models deal successfully with time-series data [4, 5] like speech recognition [6, 7, 8] or handwriting recognition [9, 10]. They were also applied early on to NLP [11], modeling a sentence\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n00 18\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 8\nFe b\nas tokens processed sequentially, at each step combining the current token with previously built embeddings. These models generally consider no linguistic structure aside from word order.\nRecursive neural models [12], by contrast, are structured by syntactic parse trees. Instead of considering tokens sequentially, recursive models combine neighbors based on the recursive structure of the parse tree, starting from the leaves and proceeding recursively in a bottom-up fashion until the root of tree is reached. Figure 1 shows a recursive neural networks building a distributed representation for the phrase the food is delicious, following the operation sequence ( (the food) (is delicious) ) rather than the sequential order (((the food) is) delicious). Many recursive models have been proposed (e.g., [13, 14]), and applied to various NLP tasks, among them entailment [15, 16], sentiment analysis [17, 18, 19], question-answering [20], relation classification [21, 22], and discourse [23, 24].\nOne possible advantage of recursive models ones is their potential for capturing compositional semantics, such as the way negation, modality, or quantification compose in a tree. Another is their potential for capturing long-distance dependencies: two tokens may be structurally close to each other, even though they are far away in word sequence. For example, a verb and its corresponding direct object can be far away in terms of tokens if many adjectives lies in between, but they are adjacent in the parse tree [18]. But we don’t know which of these advantages is more important, and for which tasks, or whether other issues are at play. Indeed, the reliance of recursive models on parsing is also a potential disadvantage, since parsing is relatively slow, can be errorful, and parsers are also usually quite domain-dependent.\nOn the other hand, recent progress in multiple subfields of neural NLP has suggested that recurrent nets may be sufficient to deal with many of the tasks for which recursive models have been proposed. Recurrent models without parse structures have shown good results in sequence-to-sequence generation [25] for machine translation (e.g., [26, 27, 28]), parsing [29], and sentiment, where for example recurrent-based paragraph vectors [2] outperform recursive models [17] on the Stanford sentiment-bank dataset.\nOur goal in this paper is thus to investigate a number of task with the goal of understanding for which kinds of problems recurrent models may be sufficient, and for which kinds recursive models offer specific advantages. We investigate five tasks with different properties. Binary sentiment classification at the sentence level ([30]) and the phrase level (Sentiment Treebank [17]) can help us understand the role of recursive models in dealing with semantic compositionality. Question answering on the UMD QA dataset [20] can helps see whether parsing is useful for finding similarities between source sentences and target. Discourse parsing (RST dataset) is useful for measuring the extent to which parsing improves discourse tasks that need to combine meanings of larger tex units. and Semantic Relation Classification on the SemEval-2010 [31] data helps us understand whether parsing is helpful in dealing with long-term dependencies, such as relations between two words that are far apart in the sequence."

No pre-training procedure as described in [32] is employed. Word embeddings are initialized using GloVe [40] and kept fixed in the learning procedure3. Sentence level embeddings are fed into a sigmoid classifier: For bidirectional recurrent models, concatenation of embeddings calculated leftwardly and rightwardly are used as sentence-level vectors.\nPerformances are given in Figure 2; no large difference appears between standard recursive and recurrent models or RNTN-Recursive and RNTN-recurrent models. LSTM/BiLSTM achieve the best performances, slightly outperforming Gate-Recursive.\nWhy don’t parse trees help on this task? One possible explanation is the distance of the supervision signal from the local compositional structure. The Pang et al. dataset has an average sentence length of 22.5 words, which means it takes multiple steps before sentiment related evidence comes up to the surface. It is therefore unclear whether local compositional operators such as negation can be learned; there is only a small amount of training data and the sentiment supervision only at the level of the sentence may not be easy to propogate down to deeply buried local phrases. By contrast, gates in LSTM have the capabilities of filtering out irrelevant information and preserving useful evidence, which may explain the better performances achieved by LSTM."

This dataset contains gold-standard labels for every parse tree constituent, from the sentence to phrases to individual words. The task can either be 5-way fine-grained classification or binary coarse classification.\nFor recursive models, we followed the protocols in [17] where node embeddings in the parse trees are obtained from recursive models and then fed to a softmax classifier. Word embeddings are initialized from the uniform distribution [-0.1, 0.1] and are optimized throughout the frameworks.\nThe original treebank dataset is tailored for recursive models as sentiment labels are tagged at parse tree nodes. We transformed the dataset for recurrent model use as illustrated in Figure 3. Each phrase is reconstructed from parse tree nodes and treated as a separate data point. As the treebank contains\n2Note that bi-directional recursive models are suited for classification at the node level by considering upward and downward information, but not sentence level classification. No downward vector is computed for roots— downward vectors are computed based on parents—concatenating root embedding (upwardly computed) with leaf embeddings (downwardly computed) leads to vectors with different dimensionality. We therefore omit the bi-directional recursive model for sentence-level classification tasks.\n3Slightly better performances are observed by using GloVe than Word2Vect (either skip-grammar or CBOW) [41, 42] and SENNA [3]. Better performances are observed when keeping word embeddings fixed.\n11,855 sentences with 215,154 phrases, the reconstructed dataset for recurrent models comprises 215,154 examples4.\nWe report accuracies on both multi-class and binary classification in Figure 5. For binary classification, we did not train a separate model, just decoding the obtained probability vector into a binary decision as in [14]5. Again we see no difference between standard-recurrent vs standard-recursive models, or RNTN-Recursive vs RNTN-Recurrent modes. Unlike the earlier sentence-level classification task, gate based models (Gate-Recursive, LSTM and Bi-LSTM) do not yield better performances than standard models. This may be because each sentence has been chunked into very small pieces, so that the negative impact from the gradient vanishing is significantly alleviated.\nFigure 4 illustrates sentiment predictions at each timestep, computed by feeding vectors from the one-directional (left to right) LSTM into the softmax classifier. The figure suggests that the kind of local compositions that recursive models handle, like negation flipping the sentiment of positive examples [17], can also be captured in sequential models. Figure 4 also illustrates that despite the fact that the recurrent formulation truncatest Recurrent models are thus able to preserve information with respect to the objective (in this case sentiment) despite the fact that representations are obtained sequentially at each word, which may be mid-constituent, violating syntactic or semantic structure. This suggests that for tasks like sentiment analysis, full compositional semantic structure may not be as important as capturing the few key words that capture relevant sentiment information.\n4Recursive models obtain all node embeddings in trees jointly. For recurrent models, as we treat each phrase as a separate example, the embedding for each example is calculated from scratch, which means recurrent models take much more time to train in this case.\n5The performance of our implementations of recursive models is not exactly identical to that reported in [17], but the relative difference is less than 1%.\nAs mentioned above, none of the models we describe are state-of-the-art. State-of-the-art models [2, 14] employ more sophisticated recursive structures. Again, our goal is only to compare equivalent recursive and recurrent models, and so we do not describe the details or performances of other models, here or for the following tasks."

Similar ideas can be found in pooling structures (e.g. [43]). We can draw a similar conclusion as from Stanford Sentiment Bank: in this task, recursive models look at the relevance to the target of linguistically meaningful units from parse trees, but this does not necessarily lead to better performance than simple sequential units."

The dataset contains 9 ordered relationships, so the task is formalized as a 19-class classification problem, with directed relations treated as separate labels; see [31, 21] for details.\nFor the recursive implementations, we follow the neural framework defined in [21]. The path in the parse tree between the two nominals is retrieved, and the embedding is calculated based on recursive models and fed to a softmax classifier. 7 Retrieved paths are transformed for the recurrent models as shown in Figure 9.\n7[21] achieve state-of-art performance by combining a sophisticated model, MV-RNN, in which each word is presented with both a matrix and a vector with human-feature engineering. Again, because MV-RNN is difficult to adapt to a recurrent version, we do not employ this state-of-the-art model, adhering only to the general versions of recursive models described in Section 2, since our main goal is to compare equivalent recursive and recurrent models rather than implement the state of the art.\nResults are shown in Figure 8. Unlike for earlier tasks, here recursive models yield much better performance than the corresponding recurrent versions. Even standard recursive models perform better than LSTM.\nThese results suggest that it is the need to integrate structures far apart in the sentence that characterizes the tasks where recursive models surpass recurrent models.

Because discourse relations express the coherence structure of discourse, they presumably express different aspects of compositional meaning than sentiment or nominal relations. A discourse relation classifier takes as input a vector embedding representation of each of the two EDUs, and computes the most likely relation [24]. We compare recursive versus recurrent methods for computing EDU embeddings. See [45, 36] for more details on discourse parsing and the RST-DT corpus.\nRepresentations for adjacent EDUs are fed into binary classification (whether two EDUs are related) and multi-class relation classification models, as defined in [24]. Following [24], a CKY bottomup algorithm is used to compute the most likely discourse parse tree using dynamic programming. Models are evaluated in terms of three matrices: Span (on blank tree structures), nuclearity (on tree structures with nuclearity indication), and relation (on tree structures with rhetorical relation indication but no nuclearity indication)9. To serve the purposes for plain comparison, no additional human-developed features are added.\nResults are reported in Table 1.

But understanding exactly which tasks this parse-based method is appropriate for remains an open question. In this paper we benchmark recursive neural models against sequential recurrent neural models, which are structured solely on word sequences. We investigate 5 tasks: sentiment classification on (1) sentences and (2) syntactic phrases; (3) question answering; (4) discourse parsing; (5) semantic relations (e.g., component-whole between nouns); We find that recurrent models have equal or superior performance to recursive models on all tasks except one: semantic relations between nominals. Our analysis suggests that tasks relying on the scope of negation (like sentiment) are well-handled by sequential models. Recursive models help only with tasks that require representing long-distance relations between words. Our results offer insights on the design of neural architectures for representation learning.",
