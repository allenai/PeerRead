      "text" : "Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a challenging task due to the variability of the type of errors and the syntactic and semantic dependencies of the errors on the surrounding context. Most of the grammatical error correction systems use classification and rule-based approaches for correcting specific error types. However, these systems use several linguistic cues as features. The standard linguistic analysis tools like part-of-speech (POS) taggers and parsers are often trained on well-formed text and perform poorly on ungrammatical text. This introduces further errors and limits the performance of rule-based and classification approaches to GEC. As a consequence, the phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC has gained popularity because of its ability to learn text transformations from erroneous text to correct text from error-corrected parallel corpora without any additional linguistic information. They are also not limited to specific error types. Currently, many state-of-the-art GEC systems are based on SMT or use SMT components for error correction [Susanto et al., 2014; Felice et al., 2014;\nJunczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014]. In this paper, grammatical error correction includes correcting errors of all types, including word choice errors and collocation errors which constitute a large class of learners’ errors.\nWe model our GEC system based on the phrase-based SMT approach. However, traditional phrase-based SMT systems treat words and phrases as discrete entities. We take advantage of continuous space representation by adding two neural network components that have been shown to improve SMT systems [Ha et al., 2014; Devlin et al., 2014]. These neural networks are able to capture non-linear relationships between source and target sentences and can encode contextual information more effectively. Our experiments show that the addition of these two neural networks leads to significant improvements over a strong baseline and outperforms the current state of the art."

      "text" : "In the past decade, there has been increasing attention on grammatical error correction in English, mainly due to the growing number of English as Second Language (ESL) learners around the world. The popularity of this problem in natural language processing research grew further through Helping Our Own (HOO) and the CoNLL shared tasks [Dale and Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2013; 2014]. Most published work in GEC aimed at building specific classifiers for different error types and then use them to build hybrid systems [Dahlmeier et al., 2012; Rozovskaya et al., 2014]. One of the first approaches of using SMT for GEC focused on correction of countability errors of mass nouns (e.g., many informations→much information) [Brockett et al., 2006]. They had to use an artificially constructed parallel corpus for training their SMT system. Later, the availability of large-scale error corrected data [Mizumoto et al., 2011] further improved SMT-based GEC systems.\nRecently, continuous space representations of words and phrases have been incorporated into SMT systems via neural networks. Specifically, addition of monolingual neural network language models [Bengio et al., 2003; Vaswani et al., 2013], neural network joint models (NNJM) [Devlin et al., 2014], and neural network global lexicon models (NNGLM) [Ha et al., 2014] have been shown to be useful for SMT. Neural networks have been previously used for GEC as a language model feature in the classification approach [Wu et al.,\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n00 18\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nJ un\n2 01\n6\n2014] and as a classifier for article error correction [Sun et al., 2015]. Recently, a neural machine translation approach has been proposed for GEC [Yuan and Briscoe, 2016]. This method uses a recurrent neural network to perform sequenceto-sequence mapping from erroneous to well-formed sentences. Additionally, it relies on a post-processing step based on statistical word-based translation models to replace outof-vocabulary words. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two neural network models, NNGLM and NNJM, in SMT-based GEC. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work that uses these two neural network models for SMT-based GEC."

      "text" : "In this paper, the task of grammatical error correction is formulated as a translation task from the language of ‘bad’ English to the language of ‘good’ English. That is, the source sentence is written by a second language learner and potentially contains grammatical errors, whereas the target sentence is the corrected fluent sentence. We use a phrase-based machine translation framework [Koehn et al., 2003] for translation, which employs a log-linear model to find the best translation T ∗ given a source sentence S. The best translation is selected according to the following equation:\nT ∗ = argmax T P (T |S) = argmax T N∑ i=1 λihi(T, S)\nwhere N is the number of features, hi and λi are the ith feature function and feature weight, respectively. We make use of the standard features used in phrase-based translation without any reordering, leading to monotone translations. The features can be broadly categorized as translation model and language model features. The translation model in the phrasebased machine translation framework is trained using parallel data, i.e., sentence-aligned erroneous source text and corrected target text. The translation model is responsible for finding the best transformation of the source sentence to produce the corrected sentence. On the other hand, the language model is trained on well-formed English text and this ensures the fluency of the corrected text. To find the optimal feature weights (λ), we use minimum error rate training (MERT), maximizing the F0.5 measure on the development set [Junczys-Dowmunt and Grundkiewicz, 2014]. The F0.5 measure [Dahlmeier and Ng, 2012], which weights precision twice as much as recall, is the evaluation metric widely used for GEC and was the official evaluation metric adopted in the CoNLL 2014 shared task [Ng et al., 2014].\nAdditionally, we augment the feature set by adding two neural network translation models, namely a neural network global lexicon model [Ha et al., 2014] and a neural network joint model [Devlin et al., 2014]. These models are described in detail in Sections 4 and 5."

      "text" : "Since the prior probability of observing a particular word in a sentence is usually a small number, the probabilistic output of NNGLM can be biased towards zero. This bias can hurt the performance of our system and therefore, we try to alleviate this problem by rescaling the output after training NNGLM. Our solution is to map the output probabilities to a new probability space by fitting a logistic function on the output. Formally, we use Equation 3 as the mapping function:\nQ(ti|S) = 1\n1 + exp(−w · P (ti|S)− b) (3)\nwhere Q(ti|S) is the rescaled probability and w and b are the parameters. For each sentence pair (S, T ) in the development set, we collect training instances of the form (x, y) for every word t in the target vocabulary, where x = P (t|S) and y ∈ {0, 1}. The value of y is set according to the presence (y = 1) or absence (y = 0) of the word t in the target sentence T . We use weighted cross entropy loss function with L2regularization to train w and b on the development set:\nE = − M∑ j=1 [c1yj log p(xj) + c0(1− yj) log(1− p(xj))]\nHere, M is the number of training samples, p(x) is the probability of x computed by p(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−wx− b)), and c0 and c1 are the weights assigned to the two classes y = 0 and y = 1, respectively.

The context hi consists of a set of m source words represented by (sai−m−12 , · · · , sai+m−12 ) and n − 1 words preceding ti from the target sentence represented by (ti−n+1, · · · , ti−1). The context words from the source side are the words in the window of sizem surrounding the source word sai that is aligned to the target word ti.

The two classes are C = 1 indicating that the word is the target word and C = 0 indicating that the word is a noisy sample. The conditional probabilities for C = 0 and C = 1 given a target word and context is given by:\nP (C = 1|ti, hi) = 1 k+1P (ti|hi) 1\nk+1P (ti|hi) + k k+1q(ti)\nP (C = 0|ti, hi) = k k+1q(ti) 1\nk+1P (ti|hi) + k k+1q(ti)\nwhere, P (ti|hi) is the model probability given in Equation 6.

      "text" : "We use the popular phrase-based machine translation toolkit Moses1 as our baseline SMT system. NUCLE [Dahlmeier et al., 2013], which is the official training data for the CoNLL 2013 and 2014 shared tasks, is used as the parallel text for training. Additionally, we obtain parallel corpora from Lang8 Corpus of Learner English v1.0 [Mizumoto et al., 2011], which consists of texts written by ESL (English as Second Language) learners on the language learning platform Lang82. We use the test data for the CoNLL 2013 shared task as our development data. The statistics of the training and development data are given in Table 1. Source side refers to the original text written by the ESL learners and target side refers to the corresponding corrected text hand-corrected by humans. The source side and the target side are sentencealigned and tokenized.\nDataset No. ofsentences No. of source side tokens No. of target side tokens\nWe train the translation model for our SMT system using a concatenation of NUCLE and Lang-8 v1.0 parallel data. The training data is cleaned up by removing sentence pairs in which either the source or the target sentence is empty, or is too long (greater than 80 tokens), or violate a 9:1 sentence ratio limit. The translation model uses the default features in Moses which include the forward and inverse phrase translation probabilities, forward and inverse lexical weights, word penalty, and phrase penalty. We compute the phrase alignments using standard tools in Moses. We use two language model features: a 5-gram language model trained using the target side of NUCLE used for training the translation model and a 5-gram language model trained using English Wikipedia (∼1.78 billion tokens). Both language models are estimated with KenLM3 using modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. We use MERT for tuning the feature weights by optimizing the F0.5 measure (which weights precision twice as much as recall). This system constitutes our baseline system in Table 2. Our baseline system uses exactly the same training data as [Susanto et al., 2014] for training the translation model and the language model. The difference between\n1https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/tree/fscorer 2http://lang-8.com/ 3https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/\nour baseline system and the SMT components of [Susanto et al., 2014] is that we tune with F0.5 instead of BLEU and we use the standard Moses configuration without the Levenshtein distance feature.\nOn top of our baseline system described above, we incorporate the two neural network components, neural network global lexicon model (NNGLM) and neural network joint model (NNJM) as features. Both NNGLM and NNJM are trained using the parallel data used to train the translation model of our baseline system.\nWe implement NNGLM using the Theano library4 in Python in order to make use of parallelization with GPUs, thus speeding up training significantly. We use a source and target vocabulary of 10,000 most frequent words on both sides. We use a single hidden layer neural network with 2,000 hidden nodes. We use tanh as the activation function for the hidden layer. We optimize the model weights by stochastic gradient descent using a mini-batch size of 100 and a learning rate5 of 10. We train the model for 45 epochs. The logistic regression function for rescaling is trained using the probabilities obtained from this model on the development set. To speed up tuning and decoding, we pre-compute the probabilities of target words using the source side sentences of the development and the test sets, respectively. We implement a feature function in Moses to compute the probability of a target hypothesis given the source sentence using the precomputed probabilities.\nTo train NNJM, we use the publicly available implementation, Neural Probabilistic Language Model (NPLM) [Vaswani et al., 2013]. The latest version of Moses can incorporate NNJM trained using NPLM as a feature while decoding. Similar to NNGLM, we use the parallel text used for training the translation model in order to train NNJM. We use a source context window size of 5 and a target context window size of 4. We select a source context vocabulary of 16,000 most frequent words from the source side. The target context vocabulary and output vocabulary is set to the 32,000 most frequent words. We use a single hidden layer to speed up training and decoding with an input embedding dimension of 192 and 512 hidden layer nodes. We use rectified linear units (ReLU) as the activation function. We train NNJM with noise contrastive estimation with 100 noise samples per training instance, which are obtained from a unigram distribution. The neural network is trained for 30 epochs using stochastic gradient descent optimization with a mini-batch size of 128 and learning rate of 0.1.\nWe conduct experiments by incorporating NNGLM and NNJM both independently and jointly into our baseline system. The results of our experiments are described in Section 6.2. The evaluation is performed similar to the CoNLL 2014 shared task setting using the the official test data of the CoNLL 2014 shared task with annotations from two annotators (without considering alternative annotations suggested by the participating teams). The test dataset consists of 1,312 error-annotated sentences with 30,144 tokens on the source side.

      "heading" : "6.2 Results and Discussion",
      "text" : "Table 2 presents the results of our experiments with neural network global lexicon model (NNGLM) and neural network joint model (NNJM).\nWe see that the addition of both NNGLM and NNJM to our baseline individually improves F0.5 measure on the CoNLL 2014 test set by 0.43 and 0.80, respectively. Although both improvements over the baseline are statistically significant (with p < 0.01), we observe that the improvement of NNGLM is slightly lower than that of NNJM. NNGLM encodes the entire lexical information from the source sentence without word ordering information. Hence, it focuses mostly on the choice of words appearing in the output. Many of the words in the source context may not be necessary for ensuring the quality of corrected output. On the other hand, NNJM looks at a smaller window of words in the source side. NNJM can act as a language model and can ensure a fluent translation output compared to NNGLM.\nWe also found rescaling to be important for NNGLM because of imbalanced training data. While the most frequent words in the data, ‘I’ and to’, appear in 43% and 27% of the training sentences, respectively, most words occur in very few sentences only. For example, the word ‘set’ appears in 0.15% of the sentences and the word ‘enterprise’ appears in 0.003% of the sentences.\nBy incorporating both components together, we obtain an improvement of 1.17 in terms of F0.5 measure. This indicates that both components are beneficial and complement each other to improve the performance of the baseline system. While NNGLM looks at the entire source sentence and ensures the appropriate choice of words to appear in the output sentence, NNJM encourages the system to choose appropriate corrections that give a fluent output.\nWe compare our system to the top 3 systems in the CoNLL 2014 shared task and to the best published results [Yuan and Briscoe, 2016; Susanto et al., 2014] on the test data of the CoNLL 2014 shared task. The results are summarized in Table 4. Our final system including both neural network models outperforms the best system [Yuan and Briscoe, 2016] by 1.85 in F0.5 measure. It should be noted that this is despite the fact that the system proposed in [Yuan and Briscoe, 2016] uses much larger training data than our system.\nWe qualitatively analyze the output of our neural networkenhanced systems against the outputs produced by our baseline system. We have included some examples in Table 3 and the corresponding outputs of the baseline system and the reference sentences. The selected examples show that NNGLM and NNJM choose appropriate words by making use of the surrounding context effectively.\nNote that our neural networks, which rely on fixed source and target vocabulary, map the rare words and misspelled words to the UNK token. Therefore, phrases with the UNK token may get a higher probability than they actually should due to the large number of UNK tokens seen during training. This leads to fewer spelling error corrections compared to the baseline system which does not employ these neural networks. Consider the following example from the test data: ... numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh (huge) human traffic on such social media sites .... The spelling error hugh→ huge is corrected by the baseline system, but not by our final system with the neural networks. This is because the misspelled word hugh is not in the neural network vocabulary and so it is mapped to the UNK to-\nken. The sentence with the UNK token gets a higher score and hence the system chooses this output over the correct one.\nFrom our experiments and analysis, we see that NNGLM and NNJM capture contextual information better than regular translation models and language models. This is because they make use of larger source sentence contexts and continuous space representation of words. This enables them to make better predictions compared to traditional translation models and language models. We also observed that our system has an edge over the baseline for correction of word choice and collocation errors."

The superiority of SMT systems comes from their ability to learn text transformations from erroneous to corrected text, without explicitly modeling error types. However, phrase-based SMT systems suffer from limitations of discrete word representation, linear mapping, and lack of global context. In this paper, we address these limitations by using two different yet complementary neural network models, namely a neural network global lexicon model and a neural network joint model. These neural networks can generalize better by using continuous space representation of words and learn non-linear mappings. Moreover, they can leverage contextual information from the source sentence more effectively. By adding these two components, we achieve statistically significant improvement in accuracy for grammatical error correction over a state-of-the-art GEC system.",
