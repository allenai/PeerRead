{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Understanding intermediate layers using linear classifier probes", "abstract": "Neural network models have a reputation for being black boxes. We propose a new method to better understand the roles and dynamics of the intermediate layers. This has direct consequences on the design of such models and it enables the expert to be able to justify certain heuristics (such as adding auxiliary losses in middle layers). Our method uses linear classifiers, referred to as ``probes'', where a probe can only use the hidden units of a given intermediate layer as discriminating features. Moreover, these probes cannot affect the training phase of a model, and they are generally added after training. They allow the user to visualize the state of the model at multiple steps of training. We demonstrate how this can be used to develop a better intuition about models and to diagnose potential problems.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The authors propose a method to investigate the predictiveness of intermediate layer activations.

The lack of experiments on more complex state-of-the-art networks is also potentially problematic. In the end, it seems that there is insufficient evidence that the proposed approach is actually a useful tool in its present state, though the authors should be encouraged to pursue this line of research further.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Final review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes a method that attempts to \"understand\" what is happening within a neural network by using linear classifier probes which are inserted at various levels of the network.\n\nI think the idea is nice overall because it allows network designers to better understand the representational power of each layer in the network, but at the same time, this works feels a bit rushed. In particular, the fact that the authors did not provide any results in \"real\" networks, which are used to win competitions makes the results less strong, since researchers who want to created competitive network architectures don't have enough evidence from this work to decides whether they should use it or not.\n\nIdeally, I would encourage the authors to consider continuing this line of research and show how to use the information given by these linear classifiers to construct better network architectures. \n\nUnfortunately, as is, I don't think we have enough novelty to justify accepting this work in the conference.

The training of the linear classifier does not affect the training of the neural network. \n\nThe paper is well motivated for investigating how much useful information (or how good the representations are) for each layer. The observations in this paper agrees with existing insights, such as, 1) (Fig 5a) too many random layers are harmful. 2) (Fig 5b) training is helpful. 3) (Fig 7) lower layers converge faster than higher layer. 4) (Fig 8) too deep network is hard to train, and skip link can remedy this problem.\n\nHowever, this paper has following problems:\n\n1. It is not sufficiently justified why the linear classifier is a good probe. It is not crystal clear why good intermediate features need to show high linear classification accuracy. More theoretical analysis and/or intuition will be helpful.   \n2. This paper does not provide much insight on how to design better networks based on the observations. Designing a better network is also the best way to justify the usefulness of the analysis.\n\nOverall, this paper is tackling an interesting problem, but the technique (the linear classifier as the probe) is not novel and more importantly need to be better justified. Moreover, it is important to show how to design better neural networks using the observations in this paper.\n  \n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 4, "DATE": "13 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Linear predictiveness of intermediate layer activations.", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The authors propose a method to investigate the predictiveness of intermediate layer activations.
