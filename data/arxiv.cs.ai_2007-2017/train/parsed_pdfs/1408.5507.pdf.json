      "text" : "In this book the authors introduced the notions of soft neutrosophic\nalgebraic structures. These soft neutrosophic algebraic structures are\nbasically defined over the neutrosophic algebraic structures which\nmeans a parameterized collection of subsets of the neutrosophic\nalgebraic structure. For instance , the existence of a soft neutrosophic\ngroup over a neutrosophic group or a soft neutrosophic semigroup over a\nneutrosophic semigroup, or a soft neutrosophic field over a neutrosophic\nfield, or a soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup over a neutrosophic LA-\nsemigroup, or a soft neutosophic loop over a neutrosophic loop. It is\ninteresting to note that these notions are defined over finite and infinite\nneutrosophic algebraic structures. These structures are even bigger than\nthe classical algebraic structures.\nThis book contains five chapters. Chapter one is about the\nintroductory concepts. In chapter two the notions of soft neutrosophic\ngroup, soft neutrosophic bigroup and soft neutrosophic N-group are\nintroduced and many fantastic properties are given with illustrative\nexamples. Soft neutrosophic semigroup, soft neutrosophic bisemigroup\nand soft neutrosophic N-semigroup are placed in the second chapter with\nrelated properties. The chapter three is about soft neutrosophic loop with\nsoft neutrosophic biloop and soft neutrosophic N-loop. Chapter four\ncontained on soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup, soft neutrosophic bi-LA-\nsemigroup and soft neutrosophic N-LA-semigroup. In the final chapter,\nthere are number of suggestive problems."

      "text" : "groups and their Properties\nGroups are the only perfect and rich algebraic structures than other\nalgebraic strutures with one binary operation. Neutrosophic groups\nareeven bigger algebraic structures than groups with some kind of\nindeterminacy factor. Now we proceed to define a neutrosophic group.\nDefinition 1.1.1: Let ( , )G be any group and let\n{ : , }G I a bI a b G . Then the neutrosophic group is generated by\nI and G under denoted by ( ) { , }N G G I . I is called the neutrosophic element with the property 2I I . For an integer n , n I and nI are neutrosophic elements and 0. 0I .\n1 I , the inverse of I is not defined and hence does not exist.\nTheorem 1.1.1: Let ( )N G be a neutrosophic group. Then\n1) ( )N G in general is not a group. 2) ( )N G always contains a group.\nExample 1.1.1: ( ( ), )N Z , ( ( ), )N Q , ( ( ), )N R and ( ( ), )N C are neutrosophic groups of integer, rational, real and complex numbers respectively.\nExample 1.1.2: Let 7 {0,1,2,...,6}Z be a group under addition modulo 7 . 7( ) { , ' 'mod 7}N G Z I ulo is a neutrosophic group which is in fact a group. For 7( ) { : , }N G a bI a b Z is a group under ` ' modulo 7 .\nExample 1.1.3: Let 4( )N G Z I is a neutrosophic group under addition modul 4 , where\n4\n0,1, 2, 3, , 2 , 3 ,1 ,1 2 ,1 3 , ( )\n2 , 2 2 ,2 3 , 3 , 3 2 , 3 3\nI I I I I I N Z\nI I I I I I\nDefinition 1.1.2: A pseudo neutrosophic group is defined as a neutrosophic group, which does not contain a proper subset which is a group.\nExample 1.1.4: Let\n2( ) {0,1, ,1 }N Z I I\nbe a neutrosophic group under addition modulo 2. Then 2( )N Z is a pseudo neutrosophic group.\nDefinition 1.1.3: Let ( )N G be a neutrosophic group. Then,\n1) A proper subset ( )N H of ( )N G is said to be a neutrosophic subgroup\nof ( )N G if ( )N H is a neutrosophic group, that is, ( )N H contains a proper subset which is a group.\n2) ( )N H is said to be a pseudo neutrosophic subgroup if it does not\ncontain a proper subset which is a group.\nDefinition 1.1.4: Let ( )N G be a finite neutrosophic group. Let P be a proper subset of ( )N G which under the operations of ( )N G is a neutrosophic group. If o( ) / o( ( ))P N G then we call P to be a Lagrange neutrosophic subgroup.\nDefinition 1.1.5: ( )N G is called weakly Lagrange neutrosophic group if ( )N G has at least one Lagrange neutrosophic subgroup.\nDefinition 1.1.6: ( )N G is called Lagrange free neutrosophic group if ( )N G has no Lagrange neutrosophic subgroup.\nDefinition1.1.7 : Let ( )N G be a finite neutrosophic group.

We say a neutrosophic subgroup H of ( )N G is normal if we can find x and y in ( )N G such that H xHy for all , ( )x y N G (Note x y or 1y x can also occur).\nDefinition 1.1.11: A neutrosophic group ( )N G which has no nontrivial neutrosophic normal subgroup is called a simple neutrosophic group.\nDefinition 1.1.12: Let ( )N G be a neutrosophic group. A proper pseudo neutrosophic subgroup P of ( )N G is said to be normal if we have P xPy for all , ( )x y N G . A neutrosophic group is said to be pseudo simple neutrosophic group if ( )N G has no nontrivial pseudo normal subgroups.\nDefinition 1.1.13: Let       1 2 1 2, ,NB G B G B G    be a non-empty subset with two binary operations on  NB G satisfying the following conditions:\n1.       1 2NB G B G B G  where  1B G and  2B G are proper subsets\nof  NB G .\n2.   1 1,B G  is a neutrosophic group. 3.   2 2,B G  is a group .\nThen we define   1 2, ,NB G   to be a neutrosophic bigroup. If both  1B G and  2B G are neutrosophic groups. We say  NB G is a strong neutrosophic bigroup. If both the groups are not neutrosophic group, we say  NB G is just a bigroup.\nExample 1.1.5: Let       1 2NB G B G B G  where    91 / 1B G g g  be a cyclic group of order 9 and    2 1,2, ,2B G I I neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 3 .

If both of 1P and 2P are not neutrosophic then we call 1 2P P P  to be just a bigroup. Definition 1.1.15: Let       1 2 1 2, ,NB G B G B G    be a neutrosophic bigroup. If both  1B G and  2B G are commutative groups, then we call\n NB G to be a commutative bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.16: Let       1 2 1 2, ,NB G B G B G    be a neutrosophic bigroup.

Let       1 2 1 2, ,P G P G P G    be a neutrosophic subbigroup of  NB G . If      / No P G o B G then we call  P G a Lagrange neutrosophic subbigroup, if every neutrosophic subbigroup P is such that     / No P o B G then we call  NB G to be a Lagrange neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.19: If  NB G has atleast one Lagrange neutrosophic subbigroup then we call  NB G to be a weak Lagrange neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.20: If  NB G has no Lagrange neutrosophic subbigroup\nthen  NB G is called Lagrange free neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.21: Let       1 2 1 2, ,NB G B G B G    be a neutrosophic bigroup. Suppose     1 2 1 2, ,P P G P G    and     1 2 1 2, ,K K G K G    be any two neutrosophic subbigroups. we say P and K are conjugate if each  iP G is conjugate with   , 1,2iK G i  , then we say P and K are neutrosophic conjugate subbigroups of  NB G .\nDefinition 1.1.22: A set  , ,G I  with two binary operations `  '\nand ` ' is called a strong neutrosophic bigroup if\n1. 1 2 ,G I G I G I     2.  1 ,G I  is a neutrosophic group and 3.  2 ,G I is a neutrosophic group.\nExample 1.1.7: Let  1 2, ,G I   be a strong neutrosophic bigroup where  0,1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4G I Z I I I I I    . Z I under `  ' is a\nneutrosophic group and  0,1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4I I I I under multiplication modulo\n5 is a neutrosophic group.\nDefinition 1.1.23: A subset H  of a strong neutrosophic bigroup  , ,G I  is called a strong neutrosophic subbigroup if H itself is a\nstrong neutrosophic bigroup under `  ' and ` ' operations defined on\nG I .\nDefinition 1.1.24: Let  , ,G I  be a strong neutrosophic bigroup of\nfinite order. Let H  be a strong neutrosophic subbigroup of  , ,G I  . If    /o H o G I then we call H, a Lagrange strong\nneutrosophic subbigroup of G I . If every strong neutrosophic\nsubbigroup of G I is a Lagrange strong neutrosophic subbigroup then\nwe call G I a Lagrange strong neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.25: If the strong neutrosophic bigroup has at least one Lagrange strong neutrosophic subbigroup then we call G I\na weakly Lagrange strong neutrosophic bigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.26: If G I has no Lagrange strong neutrosophic\nsubbigroup then we call G I a Lagrange free strong neutrosophic\nbigroup.\nDefinition 1.1.27: Let  , ,G I  be a strong neutrosophic bigroup\nwith 1 2G I G I G I     . Let  , ,H  be a neutrosophic subbigroup where 1 2H H H  . We say H is a neutrosophic normal subbigroup of G if both 1H and 2H are neutrosophic normal subgroups of 1G I and 2G I respectively.\nDefinition 1.1.28: Let 1 2 , ,G G G    , be a neutrosophic bigroup. We say two neutrosophic strong subbigroups 1 2H H H  and 1 2K K K  are conjugate neutrosophic subbigroups of 1 2G I G I G I     if 1H is conjugate to 1K and 2H is conjugate to 2K as neutrosophic subgroups of\n1G I and 1G I respectively.\nDefinition 1.1.29: Let  1, ,..., NG I   be a nonempty set with N -binary operations defined on it. We say G I is a strong neutrosophic N -\ngroup if the following conditions are true.\n1) 1 2 ... NG I G I G I G I        where iG I are proper subsets of\nG I .\n2)  ,i iG I  is a neutrosophic group, 1,2,...,i N .\n3) If in the above definition we have\na. 1 2 1... ...k k NG I G G I G I G I G           b.  ,i iG  is a group for some i or\n4)  ,j jG I  is a neutrosophic group for some j . Then we call G I\nto be a neutrosophic N -group.\nExample 1.1.8: Let  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, , , ,G I G I G I G I G I             be a neutrosophic 4 -group where  1 1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4G I I I I I  neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 5 .\n 2 0,1,2, ,2 ,1 ,2 ,1 2 ,2 2G I I I I I I I      a neutrosophic group under\nmultiplication modulo 3 , 3G I Z I   , a neutrosophic group under addition and     4 , : , 1, ,4,4G I a b a b I I   , component-wise multiplication modulo 5 . Hence G I is a strong neutrosophic 4 -group.\nExample 1.1.9: Let  1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4, , , ,G I G I G I G G           be a neutrosophic 4 -group, where  1 1,2,3,4, ,2 ,3 ,4G I I I I I  a neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 5 .  2 0,1, ,1G I I I   ,a neutrosophic group under multiplication modulo 2 . 3 3G S and 4 5G A , the alternating group.

It is important to note  , iP  for no i is a neutrosophic group.\nThus we see a strong neutrosophic N -group can have 3 types of\nsubgroups viz.\n1. Strong neutrosophic sub N -groups. 2. Neutrosophic sub N -groups. 3. Sub N -groups.\nAlso a neutrosophic N -group can have two types of sub N -groups.\n1. Neutrosophic sub N -groups. 2.

The semigroup generated by S and I i.e. S I is denoted by S I is defined to be a neutrosophic\nsemigroup where I is indeterminacy element and termed as neutrosophic element. It is interesting to note that all neutrosophic semigroups contain a proper subset which is a semigroup.\nExample 1.2.1: Let {Z  the set of positive and negative integers with zero} , Z is only a semigroup under multiplication. Let ( )N S Z I  be\nthe neutrosophic semigroup under multiplication. Clearly (S)Z N is a semigroup.\nDefinition 1.2.2: Let ( )N S be a neutrosophic semigroup. A proper subset P of ( )N S is said to be a neutrosophic subsemigroup, if P is a neutrosophic semigroup under the operation of ( )N S . A neutrosophic semigroup ( )N S is said to have a subsemigroup if ( )N S has a proper subset which is a semigroup under the operation of ( )N S .\nTheorem 1.2.1: Let ( )N S be a neutrosophic semigroup. Suppose 1P and\n2P be any two neutrosophic subsemigroups of ( )N S .

      "text" : "The definition of soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup is introduced in this section and we also examine some of their properties. Throughout this section  N S will dnote a neutrosophic LA-semigroup unless stated otherwise.\nDefinition 5.1.1: Let  ,F A be a soft set over  N S . Then  ,F A over\n N S is called soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup if      , , ,F A F A F A . Proposition 5.1.1: A soft set  ,F A over  N S is a soft neutrosophic LAsemigroup if and only if  F a  is a neutrosophic sub LA-semigroup of\n N S for all a A . Proof: Let  ,F A be a soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup over  N S . By definition      , , ,F A F A F A , and so      F a F a F a for all .a A This means  F a  is a neutrosophic sub LA-semigroup of   .N S Conversely suppose that  ,F A is a soft set over  N S and for all a A ,\n F a is a neutrosophic sub LA-semigruop of  N S whenever  F a  . Since  F a is a neutrosophic sub LA-semigroup of  N S , therefore\n     F a F a F a for all a A and consequently      , , ,F A F A F A which completes the proof. Example 5.1.1:Let    1,2,3,4,1 ,2 ,3 ,4N S I I I I be a neutrosophic LAsemigroup with the following table.\n*\n1 2 3 4 1I 2I 3I 4I\n1 1 4 2 3 1I 4I 2I 3I\n2 3 2 4 1 3I 2I 4I 1I\n3 4 1 3 2 4I 1I 3I 2I\n4 2 3 1 4 2I 3I 1I 4I\n1I 1I 4I 2I 3I 1I 4I 2I 3I\n2I 3I 2I 4I 1I 3I 2I 4I 1I\n3I 4I 1I 3I 2I 4I 1I 3I 2I\n4I 2I 3I 1I 4I 2I 3I 1I 4I\nLet  ,F A be a soft set over  N S .

Theorem 5.1.1: A soft LA-semigroup over an LA-semigroup S is contained in a soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup over  N S . Proof: Snice an LA-semigroup S is always contained in the corresponding neutrosophic LA-semigroup and henc it follows that soft LA-semigroup over S is contained in soft neutrosophic LA-semigroup over  N S .
