      "text" : "The explosive growth in the number of web pages has drawn much attention to the study of information extraction [Sarawagi, 2008] in recent decades. The aim of this is to distill unstructured online texts, so that we can store and exploit the distilled information as structured knowledge. Thanks to the long-term efforts made by experts, crowdsouring and even machine learning techniques, several web-scale knowledge repositories have been built, such as Wordnet1, Freebase2 and NELL3, and most of them contain tens of millions of extracted beliefs which are commonly represented by triplets, i.e. 〈head entity, relation, tail entity〉.\nAlthough we have gathered colossal quantities of beliefs, state of the art work in the literature [West et al., 2014] reported that in this field, our knowledge bases\n1http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 2https://www.freebase.com/ 3http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/\nare far from complete. For instance, nearly 97% persons in Freebase have unknown parents. To populate incomplete knowledge repositories, a large proportion of researchers follow the classical approach by extracting knowledge from texts [Zhou et al., 2005; Bach and Badaskar, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009]. For example, they explore ideal approaches that can automatically generate a precise belief like 〈Madrid, capital city of, Spain〉 from the sentence “Madrid is the capital and largest city of Spain.”4 on the web. However, even cutting-edge research [Fan et al., 2014] could not satisfy the demand of web-scale deployment, due to the diversification of natural language expression. Moreover, many implicit relations between two entities which are not recorded by web texts still need to be mined.\nTherefore, some recent studies focus on inferring undiscovered beliefs based on the knowledge base itself without using extra web texts. One representative idea is to consider the whole repository as a graph where entities are nodes and relations are edges. The canonical approaches [Quinlan and Cameron-Jones, 1993; Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2013] generally conduct relationspecific random walk inference based on the local connectivity patterns learnt from the imperfect knowledge graph. An alternative paradigm aims to perform open-relation inference via embedding all the elements, including entities and relations, into low-dimensional vector spaces. The proposed methods [Sutskever et al., 2009; Jenatton et al., 2012; Bordes et al., 2011; Bordes et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014] show promising performance, however, by means of learning from ground-truth training knowledge.\nThis paper thus contributes a probabilistic knowledge embedding model called IIKE5 to measure the probability of each triplet, i.e. 〈h, r, t〉, and our objective is to learn a better low-dimensional vector representation for each entity (h and t) and relation (r) in the process of minimizing the loss of fitting the corresponding confidence given by machine learning (NELL) or crowdsouring (Freebase). To the best of our knowledge, IIKE is the first approach that attempts to learn global connectivity patterns for open-relation inference on imperfect and incomplete knowledge bases. In order to prove the effectiveness of the model, we conduct exper-\n4http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid 5short for Imperfect and Incomplete Knowledge Embedding.\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n08 15\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 7\nM ar\n2 01\n5\niments on two tasks involved in knowledge inference, link prediction and triplet classification, using the two repositories mentioned above. Inexact beliefs are used to train our model, and we test the performance on ground truth beliefs. Results show that IIKE outperforms the other cutting-edge approaches on both different types of knowledge bases."

Distributed representation: Graph-based models regard the entities and relations as atomic elements, and represent them in a symbolic framework. In contrast, embedding-based models explore distributed representations via learning a lowdimensional continuous vector representation for each entity and relation.\n• Relation-specific v.s. Open-relation: Graph-based models aim to induce rules or paths for a specific relation first, and then infer corresponding new beliefs. On the other hand, embedding-based models encode all relations into the same embedding space and conduct inference without any restriction on some specific relation."

      "text" : "Graph-based inference models generally learn the representation for specific relations from the knowledge graph.\nN-FOIL [Quinlan and Cameron-Jones, 1993] learns first order Horn clause rules to infer new beliefs from the known ones. So far, it has helped to learn approximately 600 such rules. However, its ability to perform inference over largescale knowledge repositories is currently still very limited.\nPRA [Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011; Gardner et al., 2013] is a data-driven random walk model which follows the paths from the head entity to the tail entity on the local graph structure to generate non-linear feature combinations representing the labeled relation, and uses logistic regression to select the significant features which contribute to classifying other entity pairs belonging to the given relation."

      "heading" : "2.2 Embedding-based Inference",
      "text" : "Embedding-based inference models usually design various scoring functions fr(h, t) to measure the plausibility of a triplet 〈h, r, t〉. The lower the dissimilarity of the scoring function fr(h, t) is, the higher the compatibility of the triplet will be.\nUnstructured [Bordes et al., 2013] is a naive model which exploits the occurrence information of the head and the tail entities without considering the relation between them. It defines a scoring function ||h − t||, and this model obviously\ncan not discriminate a pair of entities involving different relations. Therefore, Unstructured is commonly regarded as the baseline approach.\nDistance Model (SE) [Bordes et al., 2011] uses a pair of matrices (Wrh,Wrt), to characterize a relation r. The dissimilarity of a triplet is calculated by ||Wrhh −Wrtt||1. As pointed out by Socher et al. [2013], the separating matrices Wrh and Wrt weaken the capability of capturing correlations between entities and corresponding relations, even though the model takes the relations into consideration.\nSingle Layer Model, proposed by Socher et al. [2013] thus aims to alleviate the shortcomings of the Distance Model by means of the nonlinearity of a single layer neural network g(Wrhh+Wrtt+br), in which g = tanh. The linear output layer then gives the scoring function: uTr g(Wrhh + Wrtt + br).\nBilinear Model [Sutskever et al., 2009; Jenatton et al., 2012] is another model that tries to fix the issue of weak interaction between the head and tail entities caused by Distance Model with a relation-specific bilinear form: fr(h, t) = hTWrt.\nNeural Tensor Network (NTN) [Socher et al., 2013] designs a general scoring function: fr(h, t) = uTr g(h\nTWrt + Wrhh+Wrtt+br), which combines the Single Layer Model and the Bilinear Model. This model is more expressive as the second-order correlations are also considered into the nonlinear transformation function, but the computational complexity is rather high.\nTransE [Bordes et al., 2013] is a canonical model different from all the other prior arts, which embeds relations into the same vector space of entities by regarding the relation r as a translation from h to t, i.e. h + r = t. It works well on the beliefs with ONE-TO-ONE mapping property but performs badly on multi-mapping beliefs. Given a series of facts associated with a ONE-TO-MANY relation r, e.g. (h, r, t1), (h, r, t2), ..., (h, r, tm), TransE tends to represent the embeddings of entities on MANY-side extremely the same with each other and hardly to be discriminated.\nTransH [Wang et al., 2014] is the state of the art approach as far as we know. It improves TransE by modeling a relation as a hyperplane, which makes it more flexible with regard to modeling beliefs with multi-mapping properties.\nEven though the prior arts of knowledge embedding are promising when conducting open-relation inference on largescale bases, the stage they stand on is made of ground-truth beliefs. The model IIKE that we have proposed belongs to the embedding-based community, but firstly tackles the problem with knowledge inference based on imperfect and incomplete repositories. Nevertheless, we compare our approach with the methods mentioned above, and assess the performance with both the dataset and the metrics they have used as part of the extensive experiments."

      "text" : "The plausibility of a belief 〈h, r, t〉 can be regarded as the joint probability of the head entity h, the relation r and the tail entity t, namely Pr(h, r, t). Similarly, Pr(h|r, t) stands for the conditional probability of predict-\ning h given r and t. We assume that Pr(h, r, t) is collaboratively influenced by Pr(h|r, t), Pr(r|h, t) and Pr(t|h, r), and more specifically it equals to the geometric mean of Pr(h|r, t)Pr(r|h, t)Pr(t|h, r), which is shown in the subsequent equation,\nPr(h, r, t) = 3 √ Pr(h|r, t)Pr(r|h, t)Pr(t|h, r). (1)\nGiven r and t, there are multiple choices of h′ which may appear as the head entity. Therefore, if we use Eh to denote the set of all the possible head entities given r and t, Pr(h|r, t) can be defined as\nPr(h|r, t) = exp D(h,r,t)∑\nh′∈Eh exp D(h′,r,t)\n, (2)\nThe other factors, i.e. Pr(r|h, t) and Pr(r|h, t), are defined accordingly by slightly revising the normalization terms as shown in Equation (3) and (4), in which R and Et represents the set of relations and tail entities, respectively.\nPr(r|h, t) = exp D(h,r,t)∑\nr′∈R exp D(h,r′,t)\n. (3)\nPr(t|h, r) = exp D(h,r,t)∑\nt′∈Et exp D(h,r,t′)\n. (4)\nThe last function that we do not explain in Equation (2), (3) and (4) is D(h, r, t). Inspired by somewhat surprising patterns learnt from word embeddings [Mikolov et al., 2013b] illustrated by Figure 1, the result of word vector calculation, for instance vMadrid − vSpain + vFrance, is closer to vParis than to any other words [Mikolov et al., 2013a]. If we study the example mentioned above, the most possible reason vSpain − vMadrid ≈ vFrance − vParis, is that capital city of is the relation between Madrid and Spain , and so is Paris and France. In other words, hMadrid + rcapital city of ≈ tSpain, if the belief is plausible. Therefore, we define D(h, r, t) as follows to calculate the dissimilarity between h + r and t using L1 or L2 norm, and set b as the bias parameter.\nD(h, r, t) = −||h + r− t||+ b. (5)\nSo far, we have already modeled the probability of a belief, i.e. Pr(h, r, t). On the other hand, some imperfect repositories, such as NELL, which is automatically built by machine learning techniques [Carlson et al., 2010], assign a confidence score ([0.5 − 1.0]) to evaluate the plausibility of the corresponding belief. Therefore, we define the cost function L shown in Equation (6), and our objective is to learn a better low-dimensional vector representation for each entity and relation while continuously minimizing the total loss of fitting each belief 〈h, r, t, c〉 in the training set ∆ to the corresponding confidence c.\narg min h,r,t\nL = ∑\n〈h,r,t,c〉∈∆\n1 2 (logPr(h, r, t)− log c)2\n= ∑\n〈h,r,t,c〉∈∆\n1 2 {1 3 [logPr(h|r, t) + logPr(r|h, t)\n+ logPr(t|h, r)]− log c)}2.\n(6)"

[2013a], we have found an efficient approach that adopts negative sampling to transform the conditional probability functions, i.e. Equation (2), (3) and (4), to the binary classification problem, as shown in the subsequent equations,\nlogPr(h|r, t) ≈ logPr(1|h, r, t)\n+ k∑ i=1 Eh′i∼Pr(h′∈Eh) logPr(0|h ′ i, r, t),\n(7)\nlogPr(r|h, t) ≈ logPr(1|h, r, t)\n+ k∑ i=1 Er′i∼Pr(r′∈R) logPr(0|h, r ′ i, t),\n(8)\nlogPr(t|h, r) ≈ logPr(1|h, r, t)\n+ k∑ i=1 Et′i∼Pr(t′∈Et) logPr(0|h, r, t ′ i),\n(9)\nin (7), (8), and (9), we sample k negative beliefs and discriminate them from the positive case.

More specifically, link prediction performs inference via predicting a ranked list of missing entities or relations given the other two elements of a triplet. For example, it can predict a series of t given h and r, or a bunch of h given r and t. And triplet classification is to discriminate whether a triplet 〈h, r, t〉 is correct or wrong.\nSeveral recent research works [Bordes et al., 2013; Socher et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014] reported that they used subsets of Freebase (FB) data to evaluate their models and showed the performance on the above two tasks, respectively.

Finally, we locate the ground-truth triplet and record its rank. This whole procedure runs in the same way when replacing the tail entity, so that we can gain the mean results. We use two metrics, i.e. Mean Rank and Mean Hit@10 (the proportion of ground truth triplets that rank in Top 10), to measure the performance. However, the results measured by those metrics are relatively inaccurate, as the procedure above tends to generate false negative triplets. In other words, some of the candidate triplets rank rather higher than the ground truth triplet just because they also appear in the training set. We thus filter out those triplets to report more reasonable results.\n8It turns out that embedding models prefer a larger dimension of vector representations for the dataset with more entities, and L1 norm for fewer relations."

We propose IIKE (Imperfect and Incomplete Knowledge Embedding), a probabilistic model which measures the probability of each belief, i.e. 〈h, r, t〉, in largescale knowledge bases such as NELL and Freebase, and our objective is to learn a better lowdimensional vector representation for each entity (h and t) and relation (r) in the process of minimizing the loss of fitting the corresponding confidence given by machine learning (NELL) or crowdsouring (Freebase), so that we can use ||h + r − t|| to assess the plausibility of a belief when conducting inference. We use subsets of those inexact knowledge bases to train our model and test the performances of link prediction and triplet classification on ground truth beliefs, respectively. The results of extensive experiments show that IIKE achieves significant improvement compared with the baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.",
