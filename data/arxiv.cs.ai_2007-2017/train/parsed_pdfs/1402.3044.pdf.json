      "text" : "A number of real-world problems consist of selecting a set of items for a group of agents to jointly use. Examples of such activities include picking a set of movies to put on a plane’s entertainment system, deciding which journals a university library should subscribe to, deciding what common facilities to build, or even voting for a parliament (or other assembly of representatives). These examples have a number of common features:\n1. There is a set of items1 and a set of agents, where each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items (e.g., this utility can be the level of appreciation for a movie, the average number of articles one reads from a given issue of a journal, expected benefit from building a particular facility, the feeling—measured in some way—of being represented by a particular politician).\n2. Typically, it is not possible to provide all the items to the agents and we can only pick some K of them, say (a plane’s entertainment system can fit only a handful of movies, the library has a limited budget, only several sites for the facilities-to-be-built are available, the parliament has a fixed size).\n3. The intrinsic utilities for items extend to the sets of items in such a way that the impact of each selected item on the utility of an agent may depend on the rank of this item (from the agent’s point of view) among the selected ones. Extreme examples include the case where each agent derives utility from his or her most preferred item only (e.g., an agent will watch his or her favorite movie only, will read / use the favorite journal / favorite facility only, will feel represented by the most appropriate politician only), from his or her least preferred item only (say, the agent worries that he or she will be somehow forced to stick to the worst item; e.g., he or she worries the family will force him or her to watch the worst available movie), or derives 1/K of the utility from each of the available items (e.g., the agent chooses the item—say, a movie—at random). However, in practice one should expect much more complicated schemes (e.g., an agent watches the top movie certainly, the second one probably, the third one perhaps, etc.; an agent is interested in having at least some T interesting journals in the library; an agent feels represented by some top T members of the parliament, etc.).\nThe goal of this paper is to formally define a model that captures all the above-described scenarios, provide a set of examples where the model is applicable, and to provide an initial set of computational results for it in terms of efficient algorithms (exact or approximate) and computational hardness results (NP-hardness and inapproximability results).\nOur work builds upon, generalizes, and extends quite a number of settings that have already been studied in the literature. We provide a deeper overview of this research in Section 5; here we mention two most directly related lines of work. First, our model where the agents derive utility from their most preferred item among the selected one directly corresponds to winner determination under the Chamberlin–Courant’s voting rule [4,13,32] (it is also very deeply connected to the model of budgeted social choice [27]) and is in a certain formal sense a variant of the facility location problem. The case where for each item each agent derives the same fraction of the utility is, in essence, the same as K-winner range-voting (or K-winner Borda [15]); that agents enjoy equally the items they get is also a key assumption in the Santa Claus problem [3], and in the problem of designing optimal picking sequences [7,10,24].\n1We use the term ‘item’ in the most neutral possible way. Items may be candidates running for an election or movies or possible facilities, and so on.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, in Section 2 we discuss several important modeling choices and provide the formal description of our model. Then, in Section 3, we discuss the applicability of the model in various scenarios. Specifically, we show a number of examples that lead to a particular parameter values of our model. Then, in Section 4 we present our computational results. The section is further partitioned into subsections regarding the following issues: (a) the complexity of computing exact solutions for our model, (b) the issue of computing approximate solutions without any restrictions on agents’ utilities, and (c) the issue of computing approximate solutions for the case where the agents utilities represent a linear spectrum of appreciation for the possible items (so-called Borda utilities). Finally, in Section 5 we discuss related work and in Section 6 we present our summary."

      "text" : "In this section we give a formal description of our model. However, before we move to the mathematical details, let us explain and justify some high-level assumptions and choices that we have made.\nFirst, we assume that the agents have separable preferences. This means that the intrinsic utility of an object does not depend on what other objects are selected. This is very different from, for example, the case of combinatorial auctions. However, in our model the impact of an object on the global utility of an agent does depend on its rank (according to that agent) among the selected items. This distinction between the intrinsic value of an item and its value distorted by its rank are also considered in several other research fields, especially decision theory (“rank-dependent utility theory”) and multicriteria decision making, from which we borrow one of the main ingredients of our approach, so-called ordered weighted average (OWA) operators [38] (see the following formal model).\nSecond, we assume that the agents’ intrinsic utilities are provided explicitly in the input as numerical values, and that these values are comparable between agents (if one agent has twice as high a utility for some item than the other one, we take it to mean that this agent likes this item twice as much). Yet, we make no further assumptions about the nature of agents’ utilities: they do not need to be normalized, they do not need to come from any particular range of values, etc. However, we often consider two special cases that can be seen as extreme ends of a spectrum of possibilities: so-called approval-based utilities (each agent’s utility for each item is either 0 or 1), and so-called Borda utilities (each agent ranks the items from the most to the least desired one and an item’s utility is the number of items that the agent likes less). In other words, in the approval-utilities case the agents only have extreme views regarding the items (they like them or not), and in the Borda-utilities case they have a full linear spectrum of appreciation of the items.\nThird, we take the utilitarian view and measure the social welfare of the agents as the sum of their perceived utilities. Other choices are of course possible. In particular, it is tempting to define the social welfare for the group as the minimum of the utilities for all agents (an egalitarian model). We have consider this approach and obtained some results\nfor it. However, although the model is worth studying, our computational results were uniformly negative (computational hardness and inapproximability results), and we have kept these results out of the current paper."

      "text" : "Let N = [n] be a set of n agents and let A = {a1, . . . , am} be a set of m items. The goal is to pick a set W of some K items (where K will be part of our input) that, in some sense, are most satisfying for the agents. To this end, (1) for each agent i ∈ N and for each item aj ∈ A, we have an intrinsic utility ui,aj that agent i derives from aj ; (2) the utility that each agent derives from a set of K items is an ordered weighted average [38] of this agent’s intrinsic utilities for these items.\nA weighted ordered average (OWA) over K numbers is a function defined through a vector α(K) = 〈α1, . . . , αK〉 of K (nonnegative) numbers 2 as follows: Let ~x = 〈x1, . . . , xK〉 be a vector of K numbers and let ~x↓ = 〈x↓1, . . . , x ↓ K〉 be the nonincreasing rearrangement of ~x, that is, x↓i = xσ(i), where σ is any permutation of {1, . . . ,K} such that xσ(1) ≥ xσ(2) ≥ . . . ≥ xσ(K). Then we set:\nOWAα(K)(~x) =\nK ∑\ni=1\nαix ↓ i\nTo make the notation lighter, we will write α(K)(x1, . . . , xK), instead of OWAα(K)(x1, . . . , xK). We will provide a more detailed discussion of OWA operators useful in our context later; for the time being let us note that they can be used, for example, to express the arithmetic average (through the size-K vector ( 1K , . . . , 1 K )), the maximum and minimum operators (through vectors (1, 0, . . . , 0), and (0, . . . , 0, 1), respectively) and the median (through the vector that has 0s everywhere, except for the middle position, where it has 1).\nGiven the above setup, we formalize our problem of computing “the most satisfying set of K items” in the following way.\nDefinition 1. In the OWA-Winner problem we are given a set N = [n] of agents with utilities over m items (alternatives) from the set A = {a1, . . . , am}, a positive integer K (K ≤ m), and a K-number OWA α(K). The task is to compute a subset W = {w1, . . . , wK} of A such that uα (K)\nut (W ) = ∑n i=1 α (K)(ui,w1 , . . . , ui,wK ) is maximal. 3\nFor a family (α(K))∞K=1 of OWAs, we write α-OWA-Winner to denote the variant of the OWA-Winner problem where, for a given solution size K, we use OWA α(K). From now on we will not mention the size of the OWA vector explicitly and it will always be\n2The standard definition of OWAs assumes normalization, that is, ∑K\ni=1 αi = 1. We do not make this assumption here, for the sake of convenience; note that whether OWA vectors are normalized or not is irrelevant to all notions and results of this paper.\n3Formally, what we define here should be called a utilitarian OWA-Winner problem because we are interested in maximizing the total utility. As said before, it is also natural to consider egalitarian OWA-Winner problem, where we maximize the utility of the worst-off agent.\nclear from context. We implicitly assume that OWAs in our families are polynomial-time computable.\nFinally, we will often speak of variants of OWA-Winner where agents’ utilities are somehow restricted. In particular, by approval-based utilities we mean that each agent’s utilities come from the set {0, 1}, and by Borda-based utilities we mean the case where for each agent i the set of his or her utilities for all the items, that is, {ui,a1 , . . . , ui,am} is equal to {0, . . . ,m− 1}. The term “Borda-based utilities” comes from the fact that such utilities translate to the scores under Borda voting rule (see, e.g., the text of Brams and Fishburn [8] for a discussion of voting procedures). Indeed, one of the most convenient ways to represent Borda-based utilities is through preference orders. For example, if for some agent i it holds that for each aj ∈ A we have ui,aj = j−1, then we would say that this agent has preference order am ≻ am−1 ≻ · · · ≻ a1. That is, the agent puts the item with utility m− 1 on the top position in the preference order, then the item with utility m− 2, then the one with utility m − 3, down to the item with utility 0. In fact, one way in which Borda-based utilities could arise is if the agents originally have the preference orders and not the utility values. One may derive the utilities using Borda’s rule of assigning utility ℓ to an item if the agent prefers it to ℓ items (or, of course, one may use one of many other ways of deriving the utility values). Borda-based utilities are also used in several works on fair division (e.g., by Brams and King [9]).\nExample 2. Let n = 6, m = 6, K = 3, A = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6}, α = (2, 1, 0), and Borda-based utilities derived from the following rankings:"

The first three agents get utility 2 × 5 + 4 = 14, the next two get 2× 4 + 4 = 14 and the last one gets 2× 3 + 1 = 7. Therefore the score of {a1, a2, a6} is 42+28+7 = 77. It can be checked that this is the optimal set. (The next best ones are {a1, a2, a4}, {a1, a2, a5} and {a1, a5, a6} , all with score 75.) Note that 3-Borda (in our terms, the rule defined by 3-best OWA, α′ = (1, 1, 1)) would choose {a1, a2, a3} and that Chamberlin and Courant’s rule (in our terms, the rule defined by 1-best OWA, α′′ = (1, 0, 0)) would choose {a1, a5, a6}."

      "text" : "OWA-Winner is a remarkably general problem and we will usually focus on some special cases, for a particular family of OWAs. Below we give a catalog of particularly useful OWA families (in the description below we take K to be the dimension of the vectors to which we apply a given OWA).\n1. k-median OWA. For each k ∈ {1, . . . ,K}, k-med(K) is the OWA defined by the vector of k − 1 zeros, followed by a single one, followed by K − k zeros. It is easy to\nsee that k-med(K)(x1, . . . , xK) is the k-th largest number in the set {x1, . . . , xK} and is known as the k-median of ~x. In particular, 1-med(K)(~x) is the maximum operator, K-med(K)(~x) is the minimum operator, and if K is odd, K+12 -med\n(K)(~x) is the median operator.\n2. k-best OWA. For each k ∈ {1, . . . ,K}, k-best(K) OWA is defined through the vector of k ones followed byK−k zeros. That is, k-best(K)(~x) is the sum of the top k values in ~x (with appropriate scaling, this means an arithmetic average of the top k numbers).\nK-best (K) K is simply the sum of all the numbers in ~x (after scaling, the arithmetic average).\n3. Arithmetic progression OWA. This OWA is defined through the vector aprog[a](K) = 〈a+(K − 1)b, a+(K− 2)b, . . . , a〉, where a ≥ 0 and b > 0. (One can easily check that the choice of b has no impact on the outcome of OWA-Winner; this is not the case for a, though.)\n4. Geometric progression OWA. This OWA is defined through the vector gprog[p](K) = 〈pK−1, pK−2, . . . , 1〉, where p > 1. (This is without loss of generality, because multiplying the vector by a constant factor has no impact on the outcome of OWA-Winner; but the choice of p matters.)\n5. Hurwicz OWA. This OWA is defined through a vector (λ, 0, . . . , 0, 1− λ), where λ, 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, is a parameter.\nNaturally, all sorts of middle-ground OWAs are possible between these particular cases, and can be tailored for a specific application. As our natural assumption is that highly ranked items have more impact than lower-ranked objects, we often make the assumption that OWA vectors are nonincreasing, that is, α1 ≥ . . . ≥ αK . While most OWA operators we consider in the paper are indeed nonincreasing, this is not the case for k-medians (except for 1-median) and Hurwicz (except for λ = 1)."

For this rule, voters (agents) have Borda utilities over a set of candidates and we wish to elect a K-member committee (for instance, a parliament),\nsuch that each voter is represented by one member of the committee. In other words, if we select K candidates, then a voter is “represented” by that selected candidate that he or she ranks highest among the chosen ones. The idea is that then, in the parliament, each selected candidate would have voting power proportional to the number of voters that he or she represents.

For instance, items are radio channels that can be unreachable, or items are candidates running in an election and these candidates may finally decide to not take a position in the elected committee, or items are parking lots that are to be built but that can sometimes be full (see [26] for further examples of social choice with possibly unavailable candidates). Moreover, we have a prior probability distribution about the (un)availability of items: as in [26], we assume that each item is available with probability p (i.i.d.). The utility an agent gets from a set of selected items S is the value of the best available object in S, that is, of the best object in S+. Therefore, it is the value of the item ranked in position i in S if the first i− 1 items are unavailable and the ith item is available. The expected contribution of an item to the utility of a user is therefore proportional to p(1− p)i−1, which leads to the OWA defined by αi = p(1− p) i−1, which is a geometric progression with initial value p and coefficient 1− p."

      "heading" : "3.3 Uncertainty About the Number of Items Enjoyed by a User",
      "text" : "We assume now that there is some uncertainty about the number of items that a user will enjoy. A first possible reason is that users may have a limited capacity to enjoy items. For instance, items are movies or books and each user has a time constraint that will prevent him or her from enjoying all selected items. A second possible reason is that users are reluctant to use items they don’t like enough: they will watch only the films whose value reaches a given subjective threshold. We give here two possible models for the choice of the OWA vectors:\n• We first assume that the probability that a user enjoys i items, for 0 ≤ i ≤ K, is uniformly distributed, that is, a user will enjoy exactly his or her first i items in S with probability P (i) = 1K+1 . Thus, she will enjoy the item ranked i if she enjoys at\nleast i items, which occurs with probability K−i+1K+1 . This leads to the OWA vector defined by αi = K − i + 1 (we disregard the normalizing constant), which is an arithmetic progression.\n• Second, we assume that the values given by each user to each item are distributed uniformly, i.i.d., on [0, 1] and that each user uses only the items that have a value at least θ, where θ is a fixed (user-independent) threshold. Therefore, a user enjoys the item in S ranked in position i if he or she values at least i items at least θ, which\noccurs with probability ∑K\nj=i\n(\nK i\n)\n(1−θ)iθK−i, thus leading to the following OWA\nvector defined by αi = ∑K\nj=i\n(\nK i\n)\n(1− θ)iθK−i. For instance, if K = 4 and θ = 34 ,\nthe OWA (omitting the denominators) is α = (175, 67, 13, 1); for K = 4 and θ = 12 , we get α = (14, 12, 5, 1); and for K = 4 and θ = 14 , we get α = (252, 243, 189, 81)."

However, as long as we seek a size-K winner set where K is a fixed constant, then the problem is in P.\nProposition 3. For each fixed constant K (the size of the winner set), OWA-Winner is in P.\nProof. For a profile with m items, there are only O(mK) sets of winners to try. We try them all and pick one that yields highest utility.\nNaturally, in practice the variant of the problem with fixed K has only limited applicability and throughout the rest of the paper we focus on the α-OWA-Winner variant of the problem where K is given as part of the input and α represents a family of OWAs, one for each value of K. By results of Procaccia, Rosenschein and Zohar [32] and Lu and Boutilier [27], we know that the 1-best-OWA-Winner problem is NP-hard both for approval and for Borda-based utilities (in this case the problem is equivalent to winner determination under appropriate variants of Chamberlin–Courant voting rule; in effect, many results regarding the complexity of this rule are applicable for this variant of the problem [4,36,37,39]). A simple reduction shows that this result carries over to each family of k-best OWAs and of k-med OWAs, where k is a fixed positive integer.\nProposition 4. For each fixed k, k-best-OWA-Winner and k-med-OWA-Winner are NP-complete, even if the utility profiles are restricted to be approval-based or Borda-based.\nProof. Let k be a fixed constant. It is easy to see that k-best-OWA-Winner and kmed-OWA-Winner are both in NP. To show NP-hardness, we give reductions from 1- best-OWA-Winner (either with approval-based utilities or with Borda-based utilities) to k-best-OWA-Winner and to k-med-OWA-Winner (with the same types of utilities).\nLet I be an instance of 1-best-OWA-Winner with n agents, m items, and where we seek a winner set of size K. We form an instance I ′ of k-best-OWA-Winner that is identical to I except that: (1) We add k − 1 special items b1, . . . , bk−1 such that under approval-based utilities each agent i has utility 1 for each item bj, 1 ≤ j ≤ k − 1, and under Borda-based utilities each agent i has utility m+j−1 for item bj , 1 ≤ j ≤ k−1. (2) We set the size of the desired winner set to be K ′ = K+k−1. It is easy to see that if there is an optimal solution W ′ for I ′ that achieves some utility x, then there is a solution W ′′ for I ′ that uses all the k − 1 items b1, . . . , bk−1 and also achieves utility x. Further, the set W ′′ − {b1, . . . , bk−1} is an optimal solution for I and, for I, has utility x−\n∑n i=1 ∑k−1 j=1 ui,bj = x− n ∑k−1 j=1 u1,bj .\nAnalogous argument shows that 1-best-OWA-Winner reduces to k-med-OWA-Winner (also for approval-based and for Borda-based utilities).\nOn the other hand, it is easy to note that for K-best OWA (that is, for the family of constant OWAs α = (1, . . . , 1)) the problem is easy.\nProposition 5. K-best-OWA-Winner is in P.\nProof. Let I be an input instance with m items and n agents, where we seek a winner set of size K. It suffices to compute for each item the total utility that all the agents would derive if this item were included in the winner set and return K items for which this value is highest.\nIndeed, if the agents’ utilities are either approval-based or Borda-based, K-best-OWAWinner boils down to (polynomial-time) winner determination for K-best approval rule and for K-Borda rule [15], respectively (see also the work of Elkind et al. [16] for a general discussion of multiwinner rules). Given this result, it is quite interesting that already (K − 1)-best-OWA-Winner is NP-hard, both for approval-based and for Borda-based utilities. In our proof we give a reduction from the standard VertexCover problem (below we also define its version for cubic graphs, which will be useful a bit later).\nDefinition 6. In the VertexCover problem we are given an undirected graph G = (V,E), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, and a positive integer K. We ask if there is a set C of up to K vertices such that each edge is incident to at least one vertex from C. The CubicVertexCover problem is identical to the standard VertexCover problem, except each vertex in the input graph is required to have degree exactly three.\nVertexCover is well-known to be NP-hard [20]; NP-hardness for CubicVertexCover was shown by Alimonti and Kann [1].\nTheorem 7. (K−1)-best-OWA-Winner is NP-complete even for approval-based utilities.\nProof. Membership in NP is clear. We show a reduction from the VertexCover problem. Let I be an instance of VertexCover with graph G = (V,E), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, and with a positive integer K (without loss of generality, we assume that K ≥ 3 and K < m).\nWe construct an instance I ′ of (K − 1)-best-OWA-Winner in the following way. We let the set of items be A = V and we form 2n agents, two for each edge. Specifically, if ei is an edge connecting two vertices, call them vi,1 and vi,2, then we introduce two agents, e 1 i and e2i , with the following utilities: e 1 i has utility 1 for vi,1 and for vi,2, and has utility 0 for all the other items; e2i has opposite utilities—it has utility 0 for vi,1 and for vi,2, and has utility 1 for all the remaining ones.\nLet W be some set of K items (i.e., vertices) and consider the sum of the utilities derived by the two agents e1i and e 2 i from W under (K−1)-best-OWA. If neither vi,1 nor vi,2 belong to W , then the total utility of e1i and e 2 i is equal to K − 1 (the former agent gets utility 0 and the latter one gets K − 1). If only one of the items, i.e., either vi,1 or vi,2, belongs to W , then the total utility of e1i and e 2 i is equal to K (the former agent gets utility 1 and the latter one still gets K − 1). Finally, if both items vi,1, vi,2 belong to W , then the total utility of e1i and e 2 i is also equal to K (the former gets utility 2 and the latter gets utility K − 2). Thus the total utility of all agents is equal to K · n if and only if the answer to the instance I is “yes”. This shows that the reduction is correct and, since the reduction is computable in polynomial time, the proof is complete.\nA variant of this result for Borda-based utilities follows by an application of a similar idea, but the restriction to Borda-based utilities requires a much more technical proof.\nTheorem 8. (K − 1)-best-OWA-Winner is NP-hard even for Borda-based utilities.\nProof. As before, it is clear that the problem is in an NP and we only show NP-hardness. We give a reduction from VertexCover (see the previous proof for an exact definition). Let I be an instance of the VertexCover problem that consists of undirected graph G = (V,E), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, and positive integer K (without loss of generality, we assume that K ≥ 3).\nFrom I, we construct an instance I ′ of (K − 1)-best-OWA-Winner with Borda-based utilities as follows. We set\nx = 4n(m+ 2)(K + 4)\nand we let the set of items be A = V ∪ {d1, d2} ∪H, where H = {h1, . . . , hx} and {d1, d2} are sets of dummy items that we need to build appropriate structure of the utility profile. To build the set of agents N , we set\ny = (n(x+m+ 2)2 + 1)\nand we set N = NE ∪N1∪ . . .∪Ny, where NE = {e 1 1, e 2 1, . . . , e 1 n, e 2 n} contains pairs of agents that correspond to the edges of G, and N1, . . . , Ny contain pairs of agents needed for the construction. Specifically, every set Ni, 1 ≤ i ≤ y, consists of two agents, f 1 i and f 2 i . We refer to the agents in the set N1 ∪ · · · ∪Ny as the “dummy agents.” We describe agents’ utilities through their preference orders. The agents in the set NE have the following preference orders. Let ei ∈ E be an edge of the graph that connects vertices vi,1 and vi,2. Agents e 1 i and e 2 i have preference orders:\ne1i : d1 ≻ d2 ≻ V − {vi,1, vi,2} ≻ H ≻ {vi,1, vi,2}, e2i : d1 ≻ d2 ≻ {vi,1, vi,2} ≻ H ≻ V − {vi,1, vi,2}.\n(When we put a set of items in a preference order, this means that this set can be replaced by these items in an arbitrary, easily computable, way.) Each agent f1i , 1 ≤ i ≤ y, has the same, fixed, preference order:\nf1i : d1 ≻ v1 ≻ v2 · · · ≻ vm ≻ d2 ≻ h1 · · · ≻ hx.\nSimilarly, each agent f2i , 1 ≤ i ≤ y, has preference order:\nf2i : d2 ≻ vm ≻ vm−1 · · · ≻ v1 ≻ d1 ≻ h1 · · · ≻ hx.\nFinally, in the instance I ′ we seek a set of winners of size K + 2. This means that we use (K + 1)-best-OWA to compute the aggregated utility than an agent derives from a set of winners.\nThis concludes the description of the reduction and it is clear that it is polynomial-time computable. Before we prove that it is correct, let us make several observations. Let W be\nsome optimal solution for I ′. We claim that W does not contain any of the items from H. For the sake of contradiction, assume that some h ∈ H belongs to W . Since d1 and d2 are ranked ahead of h in every preference order (and in some preference orders d1 is first and d2 is second, so their utility cannot be ignored by the (K +1)-best-OWA), we infer that d1 and d2 must belong to W as well (otherwise we would obtain higher utility by replacing h with one of d1 and d2 in W ). Let v be some item from V that does not belong to W . If we replace h with v in W then the total utility of the dummy agents increases by at least 2y. Why is this so? Consider some pair Ni, 1 ≤ i ≤ y of dummy agents. item h is either the lowest ranked member of W for both f1i and f 2 i or for neither. We consider these cases:\n• h is the lowest-ranked winner for both the agents in Ni. Replacing h with v means that either some other member h′ of H ∩W becomes the lowest ranked winner for both f1i and f 2 i , or d2 becomes the lowest ranked winner for f 1 i and d1 becomes\nthe lowest ranked winner for f2i . In either case, both f 1 i and f 2 i obtain utility higher by at least one from v than from the item that became the new lowest-ranked winner. Thus, the total utility yielded by these two agents increases by at least two.\n• h is not the lowest-ranked winner for either agent in Ni. In this case, since both agents rank v higher thank h and replacing h with v does not change the lowestranked winner for either of the agents, their total utility also increases at least by two.\nSince there are y pairs of agents, the total utility increases by at least 2y. Since the total utility of the agents from NE is lower than 2n(x+m+2)\n2 < 2y, we see that after the change the total utility of all the agents increases. Thus, we get a contradiction and we conclude that W does not contain any of the agents from H.\nNext, we claim that both d1 and d2 belong to W . We give a detailed argument for d1 only; the case of d2 is analogous. For the sake of contradiction, assume that d1 does not belong to W . Let vk be an item from W such for each vj , j < k, vj does not belong to W . By our assumptions, for each agent f2i , 1 ≤ i ≤ y, vk is the lowest-ranked winner from W . Thus, if we replace vk with d1 in W , then the utility of each agent f 2 i will not change, whereas the utility of each agent f1i will increase. Further, the utility of each agent from NE will increase. Thus, by replacing vk with d1, we can increase the total utility of the agents. We reach a contradiction and we conclude that d1 must have been a member of W . An analogous argument shows that d2 belongs to W as well.\nAs the result of the above reasoning, we infer that each set of winners consists of d1, d2, and K items from V . Whenever both d1 and d2 are included in the set of winners and neither item from H is, the total utility of the dummy agents is the same, irrespective which items from V are selected. With these observations, we now show that the answer for the input VertexCover instance is “yes” if and only if there is a size-(K + 2) winner set for I ′ that for agents in the set NE yields total utility at least nx(K + 4).\n(⇒) Let us assume that there exists a cover C for I, that is, a set C of K vertices such that each edge is incident to at least one vertex from C. We show that winner set W = C ∪ {d1, d2} gives total utility of every two agents e 1 i and e 2 i , 1 ≤ i ≤ n, equal to at\nleast x(K + 4). Pick some arbitrary i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and let vi,1 and vi,2 be the two vertices connected by edge ei. If both vi,1 and vi,2 belong to C, then e 2 i obtains utility at least x for each item in {vi,1, vi,2, d1, d2} (at least utility 4x in total). On the other hand, e 1 i obtains utility at least x for each item in W − {vi,1, vi,2}. This gives utility at least Kx. Altogether, both agents get utility at least x(K + 4). If only one of the items vi,1 and vi,2, say vi,1, belongs to C, then e 2 i obtains utility at least 3x (at least x for every item from {vi,1, d1, d2}), and e 1 i obtains utility at least (K + 1)x (at least 2x from items d1 and d2, and at least (K − 1)x from the K − 1 members of C that e1i ranks on the top positions). Again, both agents get utility at least x(K + 4). Thus the total utility of the agents in NE in the optimal solution must be at least nx(K + 4).\n(⇐) Assume that W is some optimal solution for I ′ and that for the agents in NE it yields utility at least nx(K + 4). By previous discussion, we know that W contains d1, d2, and K members of V . We set C = W \\ {d1, d2}. Let us fix some arbitrary i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let vi,1 and vi,2 be the two vertices connected by edge ei. We observe that under W , the total utility of agents e1i and e 2 i is at most (x+m+ 2)(K + 4) +mK. To see this, let z be the number of items from {vi,1, vi,2} that are included in C and note that (1) for the upper bound we can disregard the OWA that we use, (2) there are x + m + 2 items and so we can upper-bound the utility derived from each item by x+m+2, (3) altogether, the items from W are ranked on at most K+2− z top-(m+2) positions by e1i (we upper-bound their total utility by (K + 2− z)(x+m+ 2)) and at most 2 + z top-(m+ 2) positions by e2i (we upper-bound their total utility by (2+ z)(x+m+2)), and (4) the items from W are ranked on at most z bottom-m positions by e1i (we upper-bound their total utility by zm) and on K − z bottom-m positions by e2i (we upper-bound their total utility by (K − z)m). When we sum up these upper bounds, we get (x+m+2)(K+4)+mK. However, for our argument we also need an upper bound on the total utility of e1i and e 2 i under the assumption that neither vi,1 nor vi,2 belongs to C. In this case, the upper bound is (x+m+2)(K+3)+mK. We obtain it in the same way as the previous bound, except that we note that due to our (K + 1)-best-OWA, the utility derived by e1i can take into account at most K + 1 agents from the top-(m+ 2) positions of the preference order of e1i .\nBased on these upper bounds, we will now show that if the total utility derived from W by the agents in NE is nx(K + 4), then C must correspond to a cover of all the edges of G. To this end, consider a situation where there is at least one edge ei such that neither of the vertices that it connects belongs to C. By using our upper bounds, in this case the total utility of the agents from NE can be at most:\n(K + 3)(x+m+ 2) + (n− 1)(K + 4)(x+m+ 2) + nmK\n= (x+m+ 2)(K + 3 + (n− 1)(K + 4)) + nmK\n= (x+m+ 2)(n(K + 4)− 1) + nmK\n= xn(K + 4) + n(m+ 2)(K + 4)− (x+m+ 2) + nmK\n= xn(K + 4) + 0.25x− (x+m+ 2) + nmK\n< xn(K + 4)\n(The last two lines follow directly by the definition of x.) So, from the assumption that C is not a solution for I, we obtain that the total utility of the agents in NE must be lower than nx(K +4), which contradicts our assumption. Thus C is a correct solution for I and, so, I is a yes-instance of VertexCover. This completes the proof.\nUsing a proof that combines the ideas of the proof of Theorems 4 and 7, we show that indeed OWA-Winner is NP-hard for a large class of natural OWAs. This time, for the sake of simplicity, we give a proof for the approval-based utilities only.\nTheorem 9. Fix an OWA family α, such that there exists p, that for every α(K) we have α (K) p > α (K) p+1; α-OWA-Winner is NP-hard for approval-based utilities.\nProof. We give a reduction from CubicVertexCover problem. Let I be an instance of CubicVertexCover with graph G = (V,E), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, and positive integer K. W.l.o.g., we assume that n > 3.\nWe construct an instance I ′ of α-OWA-Winner. In I ′ we set N = E (the agents correspond to the edges), A = V ∪ {b1, b2, . . . bp−1} (there are (p − 1) dummy items; other items correspond to the vertices), and we seek a collection of items of size K + p− 1. Each agent ei, ei ∈ E, has utility 1 exactly for all the dummy items and for two vertices that ei connects and for each of the dummy items (for the remaining items ei has utility 0). In effect, each agent has utility 1 for exactly p+ 1 items.\nWe claim that I is a yes-instance of CubicVertexCover if and only if there exists a solution for I ′ with the total utility at least n\n∑p i=1 αi + (3K − n)αp+1.\n(⇒) If there is a vertex cover C of size K for G, then by selecting the items W = C ∪ {b1, b2, . . . bp−1} we obtain the required utility of the agents. Indeed, for every agent ei there are at least p items in W for which i gives value 1 (the p−1 dummy items and at least one vertex incident to ei). These items contribute the value n ∑p i=1 αi to the total agents’ utility. Additionally, since every non-dummy item has value 1 for exactly 3 agents, and since every agent has at most (p+1) items with value 1, there are exactly (3K − n) agents that have exactly (p + 1) items in W with values 1. These (p + 1)’th additional utility-1 items of the (3k − n) agents contribute (3K − n)αp+1 to the total utility. Altogether, the agents’ utility is n\n∑p i=1 αi + (3K − n)αp+1, as claimed.\n(⇐) Let us assume that there is a set of (K + p − 1) items with total utility at least n ∑p\ni=1 αi + (3K − n)αp+1. In I ′ we have (p− 1) items that have value 1 for each of the n agents, and every other item has value 1 for exactly 3 agents. Thus, the sum of the utilities of K + p − 1 items (without applying the OWA operator yet) is at most (p − 1)n + 3K = pn + (3K − n). Thus, the total utility of the agents (now applying the OWA operator) is n\n∑p i=1 αi + (3K − n)αp+1 only if for each agent ei the solution contains p items with\nutility 1. Since there are only p − 1 dummy items, it meas that for each agent ei there is a vertex vj in the solution such that ej is incident to vj . That is, I is a yes-instance of CubicVertexCover.\nThe above theorem applies directly, for example, to the families of geometric progression OWAs and arithmetic progression OWAs.\nCorollary 10. The problems gprog[p]-OWA-Winner (for any p > 1) and aprog[a]-OWAWinner (for any a > 0) are NP-complete.\nIn fact, the following theorem (whose proof builds upon the above constructions) shows an even stronger NP-hardness result.\nTheorem 11. Fix an OWA family α, such that for every K, α(K) is nonincreasing and nonconstant; α-OWA-Winner is NP-hard for approval-based utilities.\nProof sketch. We reduce from CubicVertexCover. Let I be an instance of CubicVertexCover with graph G = (V,E), where V = {v1, . . . , vm} and E = {e1, . . . , en}, and with positive integer K.\nNow let us consider α(2K); since α(2K) is nonincreasing and nonconstant, one of the two following conditions must hold.\n1. There exists p ≤ K, that α (2K) p > α (2K) p+1 .\n2. There exists p > K, that α (2K) p > α (2K) p+1 , and for every p ≤ K, we have α (2K) p = α (2K) p+1 .\nIf (1) is the case then we use a reduction similar to that in the proof of Theorem 9. The only difference is that apart from the set D1 of (p − 1) dummy items (ranked first by all agents), we introduce the set D2 of (2K − p + 1) dummy items and (2K − p + 1) sets N1, N2, . . . , N2K−p+1, each consisting of 2n dummy agents. The dummy items from D2 are introduced only to fill-up the solution up to 2K members. The dummy agents from Ni have utility 1 for each of the items from D1 and for the i’th item from D2 (they have utility 0 for all the other items). This is to enforce that the items from D2 are selected in the optimal solution. The further part of the reduction is as in the proof of Theorem 9.\nIf (2) is the case, then we use a reduction similar to that in the proof of Theorem 7. Similarly as before, we also need to introduce the sets: D1 of (p − 1) dummy items, D2 of (2K−p+1) dummy items, and (2K−p+1) sets N1, N2, . . . , N2K−p+1 of dummy agents.\nBy the above discussion, we conjecture that the family of constant OWAs, that is, the family of K-best OWAs, is the only natural family for which α-OWA-Winner is in P. We leave this conjecture as a natural follow-up question.\nNonetheless, we still might be in a position where it is necessary to obtain an exact solution for a given α-OWA-Winner instance and the brute-force algorithm from Proposition 3 is too slow. In such a case, it might be possible to use an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem, given below. We believe that this ILP formulation is interesting in its own right and, in particular, that it is interesting future work to experimentally assess the size of instances for which it yields solutions in reasonable amount of time.\nTheorem 12. OWA-Winner reduces to computing a solution for the following integer linear program.\nminimize\nn ∑\ni=1\nm ∑\nj=1\nK ∑\nk=1\nαkui,ajxi,j,k\nsubject to:\n(a) :\nm ∑\ni=1\nxi = K\n(b) : xi,j,k ≤ xj , i ∈ [n]; j, k ∈ [K]\n(c) :\nm ∑\nj=1\nxi,j,k = 1 , i ∈ [n]; k ∈ [K]\n(d) :\nK ∑\nk=1\nxi,j,k = 1 , i ∈ [n]; j ∈ [m]\n(e) :\nm ∑\nj=1\nui,ajxi,j,k ≥ m ∑\nj=1\nui,ajxi,j,(k+1) , i ∈ [n]; k ∈ [K − 1]\n(f) : xi,j,k ∈ {0, 1} , i ∈ [n]; j, k ∈ [K]\n(g) : xj ∈ {0, 1} , j ∈ [m]\nProof. Consider an input instance with n agents N = [n] and m items A = {a1, . . . , am}, where we seek a winner set of size K, under OWA α = (α1, . . . , αK). For each i ∈ N , aj ∈ A, we write ui,aj to denote the utility that agent i derives from item aj.\nWe form an instance of ILP with the following variables: (1) For each i ∈ N , j ∈ [m], and k ∈ [K], there is an indicator variable xi,j,k (intuitively, we interpret xi,j,k = 1 to mean that for agent i, item aj is the k-th most preferred one among those selected for the solution). (2) For each j ∈ [m], there is an indicator variable xj (intuitively, we interpret xj = 1 to mean that aj is included in the solution). Given these variables (and assuming that we enforce their intuitive meaning), the goal of our ILP is to maximize the function ∑n\ni=1 ∑m j=1 ∑K k=1 αkui,ajxi,j,k.\nWe require that our variables are indeed indicator variables and, thus, take values from the set {0, 1} only (constraints (f) and (g)). We requite that the variables of the form xi,j,k are internally consistent. (constraint (c) says that each agent ranks only one of the candidates from the solution as k-th best, constraint (d) say that there is no agent i and item aj such that i views aj as ranked on two different positions among the items from the solution.) Then, we require that variables of the form xi,j,k are consistent with those of the form xj (constraint (b)) and that exactly K items are selected for the solution (constraint (a)).\nOur final constraint, constraint (e), requires that variables xi,j,k indeed for each agent sort the items from the solution in the order of descending utility values. We mention that constraint (e) is necessary only for the case of OWAs α that are not-nonincreasing. For a nonincreasing α, an optimal solution for our ILP already ensures the correct “sorting” (otherwise our goal function would not be maximized).\nAlgorithm 1: The greedy algorithm for finding the utilitarian set of K winners.\nW ← ∅ ; for ℓ ← 1 to K do\nscore ← {} ; foreach a ∈ A \\W do\ns ← 0; foreach i ∈ N do\np ← ‖{w ∈ W : ui,w ≤ ui,a‖+ 1 ; s ← s+ ui,a · αp ;\nscore[a] ← s W ← W ∪ {argmaxa∈A\\W score[a]};"

      "text" : "The OWA-Winner problem is particularly well-suited for applications that involve recommendation systems (see, e.g., the work of Lu and Boutilier [27] for a discussion of 1-bestOWA-Winner in this context). For recommendation systems it often suffices to find good approximate solutions instead of perfect, exact ones, especially if we only have estimates of agents’ utilities. It turns out that the quality of the approximate solutions that we can produce for OWA-Winner very strongly depends on both the properties of the particular family of OWAs used and on the nature of agents’ utilities.\nFirst, we show that as long as our OWA is nonincreasing, a simple greedy algorithm achieves (\n1− 1e )\napproximation ratio. This result follows by showing that for a nonincreasing OWA α, the function uαut (recall Definition 1) is submodular and nondecreasing, and by applying the famous result of Nemhauser et al. [30].\nRecall that if A is some set and u is a function u : 2A → R+, then we say that: (1) u is submodular if for each W and W ′, W ⊆ W ′ ⊆ A, and each a ∈ A \\ W ′ it holds that u(W ∪ a)− u(W ) ≥ u(W ′ ∪ a)− u(W ′), and (2) u is nondecreasing if for each W ⊆ A and each a ∈ A it holds that u(W ∪ {a}) ≥ u(W ).\nLemma 13. Let I be an instance of OWA-Winner with a nonincreasing OWA α. The function uαut is submodular and nondecreasing.\nProof. Let I be an instance of OWA-Winner with agent set N = [n], item set A = {a1, . . . , am}, desired solution size K, and OWA α = 〈α1, . . . , αK〉. For each agent i ∈ N and each item aj ∈ A, ui,aj is a nonnegative utility that i derives from aj .\nSince all the utilities and all the entries of the OWA vector are nonnegative, we note that uαut is nondecreasing. To show submodularity, we decompose u α ut as follows:\nuαut(W ) = K−1 ∑\nℓ=1\n(αℓ − αℓ+1)u ℓ-best-OWA ut (W ) + αKu K-best-OWA ut (W )\nFor each W ⊆ A, i ∈ N and ℓ ∈ [m], let Top(W, i, ℓ) be the set of those ℓ items from W whose utility, from the point of view of agent i, is highest (we break ties in an arbitrary way). Since nonnegative linear combinations of submodular functions are submodular, it suffices to prove that for each i ∈ N and each ℓ ∈ [m], function uℓi(W ) = ∑\nw∈Top(W,i,ℓ) ui,w is submodular.\nTo show submodularity of uℓi , consider two sets, W and W ′, W ⊆ W ′ ⊆ A, and some\na ∈ A \\W ′. We claim that:\nuℓi(W ∪ {a})− u ℓ i(W ) ≥ u ℓ i(W ′ ∪ {a})− uℓi(W ′). (1)\nLet uW and uW ′ denote the utilities that the i-th agent has for the ℓ-th best items from W and W ′, respectively (or 0 if a given set has fewer than ℓ elements). Of course, uW ′ ≥ uW . Let ua denote i-th agent’s utility for a. We consider two cases. If ua ≤ uW , then both sides of (1) have value 0. Otherwise:\nuℓi(W ′ ∪ {a})− uℓi(W ′) = max(ua − uW ′ , 0)\nuℓi(W ∪ {a}) − u ℓ i(W ) = ua − uW ,\nwhich proves (1) and completes the proof.\nTheorem 14. For a nonincreasing OWA α, Algorithm 1 is a polynomial time (1 − 1/e)approximation algorithm for the problem of finding the utilitarian set of K winners.\nProof. The thesis follows from the results of Nemhauser et al. [30] on approximating nondecreasing submodular functions.\nIs a (1− 1e )-approximation algorithm a good result? After all, 1− 1 e ≈ 0.63 and so the algorithm guarantees only about 63% of the maximum possible satisfaction for the agents. Irrespective if one views it as sufficient or not, this is the best possible approximation ratio of a polynomial-time algorithm for (unrestricted) OWA-Winner with a nonincreasing OWA. The reason is that 1-best-OWA-Winner with approval-based utilities is, in essence, another name for the MaxCover problem, and if P 6= NP, then (1 − 1e ) is approximation upper bound for MaxCover [17]. We omit the exact details of the connection between MaxCover and 1-best-OWA-Winner and instead we point the readers to the work of Skowron and Faliszewski [36] who discuss this point in detail (we mention that they refer to what we call 1-best-OWA-Winner as winner determination for Chamberlin–Courant’s voting rule).\nFurther, for OWAs that are not nonincreasing, it seems that we cannot even hope for such a (1 − 1e )-approximation algorithm. Such OWAs yield utility functions that are not necessarily submodular. For example, this is the case for 2-med OWA.\nExample 15. Let us consider a single agent, two sets of itemsW = {c, d} andW ′ = {b, c, d} (of course W ⊂ W ′), and 2-med-OWA α. The utilities of the agent over the items a, b, c, and d are equal to 10, 9, 2, and 1, respectively. We get:\nuαut(W ∪ {a}) − u α ut(W ) = 2− 1 = 1, u α ut(W ′ ∪ {a}) − uαut(W ′) = 9− 2 = 7.\nThat is, uαut is not submodular. Indeed, this example works even for approval-based utilities: it suffices to set the utilities for a and b to be 1, and for c and d to be 0.\nIt is quite plausible that there are no constant-factor approximation algorithms for many not-nonincreasing OWAs. As an example, let us consider the case of families of OWAs whose first entries are zero (but that, nonetheless, have a nonzero entry at a sufficiently early position). If there were a good approximation algorithm for winner determination under such OWAs, then there would be a good approximation algorithm for the DensestK-Subgraph problem, which seems unlikely.\nDefinition 16. In a Densest-k-Subgraph problem we are given an undirected graph G = (V,E) and a positive integer K. We ask for a subgraph S with K vertices with the maximal number of edges.\nTheorem 17. Fix some integer ℓ, ℓ ≥ 2. Let α be a family of OWAs such that each OWA in the family (for at least ℓ numbers) has 0s on positions 1 through ℓ−1, and has a nonzero value on the ℓ’th position. If there is a polynomial-time x(n)-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner then there is a polynomial-time x(n)-approximation algorithm for the Densest-k-Subgraph problem.\nWe should mention that Theorem 17 holds for a somewhat more general class of OWAs than stated explicitly. The proof relies on the fact that the first entry of the OWA is zero and that after the first non-zero entry of the OWA there are still K − 1 positions, where K is the parameter from the input Densest-K-Subset instance.\nof Theorem 17. Let I be an instance of the Densest-K-Subgraph problem with graph G = (V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance I ′ of α-OWA-Winner, where the set of agents N is E, the set of items is A = V ∪ {d1, . . . , dℓ−2} (or V if ℓ = 2), and we seek a winner set of size K + ℓ − 2. Agents utilities are set as follows: For each agent e and each item dj , 1 ≤ j ≤ ℓ− 2, the utility of e for dj is 1. If e is an edge in G than connects vertices u and v then agent e’s utility for u and v is 1 and is 0 for the remaining items from V .\nIt is easy too see that the items d1, . . . , dℓ−2 all belong to every optimal solution for I ′. It is also easy to see that in each optimal solution the utility of each agent e is nonzero (and exactly equal to αℓ, the ℓ-th entry of the OWA α used) if and only if both items corresponding to the vertices connected by e are included in the solution. Thus the total utility of every optimal solution for I ′ is equal to αℓ times the number of edges that connect any two vertices corresponding to the items from the solution.\nLet A be a polynomial-time x(n)-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner. If A, returns a solution S for I ′ with none-zero utility, then the items d1, . . . , dℓ−2 all belong to S. Let us take the vertices corresponding to the items S \\ {d1, . . . , dℓ−2}. The number of the edges connecting these vertices is equal to the total utility of S divided by αℓ. Thus, from x(n)-approximation solution for I ′ we can extract an x(n)-approximation solution for I. This completes the proof.\nIt seems that theDensest-k-Subgraph is not easy to approximate. Khot [25] ruled out the existence of a PTAS for the problem under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Bhaskara et al. [6] showed the polynomial integrality gap. Raghavendra and Steurer [34] and Alon et al. [2] proved that there is no polynomial-time constant approximation under non-standard assumptions. Finally, the best approximation algorithm for the problem that we know of, due to Bhaskara et al. [5], has approximation ratio O(n1/4+ǫ), where n is the number of vertices in the input graph.\nAs a further evidence that OWAs that are not-nonincreasing are particularly hard to deal with from the point of view of approximation algorithms, we show that for an extreme example of an OWA family, i.e., for the K-med OWAs, there is a very strong hardness-ofapproximation result. We start from the following graph problem.\nDefinition 18. In the Maximum Edge Biclique Problem (MEBP) we are given a balanced bipartite graph (U ∪ V,E) where U ∪ V is the set of vertices (‖U‖ = ‖V ‖) and E is the set of edges (there are edges only between the vertices from U and V ). We ask for a biclique (i.e., a subgraph S, such that every vertex from U ∩ S is connected with every vertex from V ∩ S) with as many edges as possible.\nAccording to Feige and Kogan [18], there exists a constant c such that there is no polynomial (2c √ lgn/n)-approximation algorithm for MEBP unless for some ǫ we have 3-SAT ∈ DTIME(2n 3/4+ǫ\n). Currently it seems unlikely that such an algorithm for 3-SAT exists. For our argument it is more convenient to define and use the following variant of MEBP.\nDefinition 19. In MEBP-V we are given the same input as in MEBP and a positive integer K. We ask for a biclique S such that ‖S ∩ V ‖ = K and S contains as many edges as possible. Lemma 20. There exists a constant c such that there is no polynomial-time (2c √ lgn/n)approximation algorithm for MEBP-V unless for some ǫ we have 3-SAT ∈ DTIME(2n 3/4+ǫ ).\nProof. For the sake of contradiction, let us assume that there exists a constant c and a polynomial-time (2c √ lgn/n)-approximation algorithm A for MEBP-V. By running A for every value of K ranging from 1 to ‖V ‖, we obtain a polynomial-time (2c √ lgn/n)approximation algorithm forMEBP. This stays in contradiction with the result of Feige and Kogan [18]. Theorem 21. There exists a constant c such that there is no polynomial-time (2c √ lgn/n)approximation algorithm for K-med-OWA-Winner unless for some ǫ we have 3-SAT ∈ DTIME(2n 3/4+ǫ ). Proof. Let us assume that there is a constant c and a polynomial-time (2c √ lgn/n)-approximation algorithm A for K-med-OWA-Winner. We will show that we can use A to solve instances of MEBP-V with the same approximation ratio. By Lemma 20, this will prove our theorem.\nLet I be an instance of MEBP-V with bipartite graph G = (U ∪ V,E) and positive integer K. From I we construct an instance I ′ of K-med-OWA-Winner in the following way. We let the set of agents N be U , the set of items A be V , and we seek a winner set of size K. The utility of agent u from item v is equal to 1 if and only if u and v are connected in G; otherwise it is 0. Now we note that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solutions for I and for I ′. Let S be a solution for I with x edges: S ∩ V is also a solution for I ′ with the utility at least equal to x/K. Let S be a solution for I ′ with the utility x. All the agents from U with non-zero utilities, together with S, form a biclique with Kx edges. Thus, from the (2c √ lgn/n)-approximation solution for I ′ we can extract a (2c √ lgn/n)-approximation solution for I. This completes the proof.\nAs a corollary of the above proof, we also have that Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner is NPhard (through an almost identical proof, but with a certain dummy candidate, that gets utility 1 from everyone, added, and with the size of the winner set extended by 1).\nCorollary 22. Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner is NP-hard\nInterestingly, even though Hurwicz[λ] OWA is not nonincreasing, we do show an approximation algorithm for it with a constant approximation ratio. This shows that, indeed, even for not-nonincreasing OWAs, sometimes some form of approximation result is possible (though we will comment on the value of this approximation later).\nProposition 23. Let A be a β-approximation algorithm for 1-best-OWA-Winner. A is a λ · β-approximation algorithm for Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner.\nProof. Let us consider some instance IH of Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner, where the goal is to pick a set of K items. We construct an instance I1 that is identical to IH , but for the 1-bestOWA, and we run algorithm A on I1. The algorithm outputs some set W = {w1, . . . , wK} (a β-approximate solution for I1). We claim that W is a λβ-approximate solution for IH .\nLet WH = {wH1 , . . . , w H K} be an optimal solution for I H and let W 1 = {w11, . . . , w 1 K} be an optimal solution for I1. We first note that the following holds (recall the ~x↓ notation for sorted sequences):\nu Hurwicz[λ] ut (W H) =\nn ∑\ni=1\n(\nλu↓ i,wH1 + (1− λ)u↓ i,wHK\n) ≤ n ∑\ni=1\nu↓ i,wH1\n≤ n ∑\ni=1\nu↓ i,w11 = u1-bestut (W 1).\nIn effect, we have that u1-bestut (W 1) ≥ u Hurwicz[λ] ut (W H). Now, it is easy to verify that for W (or, in fact, for any set of K items) it holds that:\nu Hurwicz[λ] ut (W ) =\nn ∑\ni=1\n(\nλu↓i,w1 + (1− λ)u ↓ i,wK\n) ≥ λ n ∑\ni=1\nu↓i,w1 = λu 1-best ut (W ).\nFinally, combining these two inequalities and the fact that W is a β-approximate solution for 1-bestOWA-Winner, we get:\nu Hurwicz[λ] ut (W ) ≥ λu 1-best ut (W ) ≥ λβu 1-best ut (W 1) ≥ λβu Hurwicz[λ] ut (W H).\nThis completes the proof.\nBy using Algorithm 1 in the general case, and the algorithm of Skowron et al. [37] for 1-best-OWA-Winner for Borda-based utilities, we get the following corollary.\nCorollary 24. (1) There is an algorithm that for Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner with no restrictions on the utility functions achieves approximation ratio λ(1− 1e ). (2) For each positive ǫ, there is an algorithm that for Hurwicz[λ]-OWA-Winner for the case of Borda-based utilities achieves approximation ration λ(1− ǫ).\nFurther, returning to nonincreasing OWAs, we can even show an example of a PTAS for OWA-Winner for a certain family OWAs. However, to defeat the relation with the MaxCover problem, these OWAs need to be of a very special form: they need to be as similar to the K-best OWA as possible.\nTheorem 25. Consider a nonincreasing OWA α, α = 〈α1, . . . , αK〉. Let I be an instance for α-OWA-Winner (where we seek a winner set of size K). An optimal solution for the same instance but with K-best-OWA is a (\n∑K i=1 αi)/(Kα1)-approximate solution for I.\nProof. Let I be the instance of α-OWA-Winner described in the statement of the theorem, let W ∗ be one of its optimal solution, and let W be an optimal solution for the same instance, but with the K-best-OWA. Note that W is also an optimal solution for the Knumber constant OWA β = 〈α1, . . . , α1〉. We claim that the following inequalities hold (u α ut is defined with respect to the instance I and uβut is defined with respect to instance I with β as the OWA):\nuαut(W ) ≥ ∑K i=1 αi Kα1 uβut(W ) ≥ ∑K i=1 αi Kα1 uβut(W ∗) ≥ ∑K i=1 αi Kα1 uαut(W ∗),\nThe second inequality holds because W is an optimal solution for I with OWA β. To see why the first and the third inequalities hold, let us focus on some agent i. The third inequality is simpler and so we prove it first.\nLet u∗1, . . . , u ∗ k be the utilities, in the nonincreasing order, that agent i has for the items\nin W ∗. Thus the utility that i gets from W ∗ under α is ∑K i=1 αiu ∗ i . Since for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ K, we have αi ≤ α1, i’s utility under α is less or equal to i’s utility under β, ∑K\ni=1 α1u ∗ i .\nWe now prove the first inequality. Let u1, . . . , uK be the utilities, in the nonincreasing order, that agent i has for the items in W . Our goal is to show that:\nα1u1 + · · ·+ αKuK ≥ ∑K i=1 αi Kα1 α1u1 + · · · + ∑K i=1 αi Kα1 α1uK = ∑K i=1 αi K u1 + · · ·+ ∑K i=1 αi K uK .\nThis inequality is equivalent to\nKα1u1 + · · ·+KαKuK ≥ K ∑\ni=1\nαiu1 + · · · + K ∑\ni=1\nαiuK ,\nwhich itself is equivalent to\nu1(Kα1 − ∑K i=1 αi) + · · ·+ uK(KαK − ∑K i=1 αi) ≥ 0.\nWe can rewrite the left-hand side of this inequality as:\n(u1 − u2)(Kα1 − ∑K i=1 αi) + (u2 − u3)(Kα1 +Kα2 − 2 ∑K i=1 αi) + · · ·+\n+ (uK−1 − uK)( ∑K−1 j=1 Kαj − (K − 1) ∑K i=1 αi) + uK( ∑K j=1Kαj −K ∑K i=1 αi).\nWe claim that each summand in this expression is nonnegative. Since u1, . . . , uK is a nonincreasing sequence of nonnegative utilities, we have that for each j, 1 ≤ j ≤ K − 1, uj − uj+1 is nonnegative, and so is uK . Now fix some t, 1 ≤ t ≤ K. We have:\n∑t j=1Kαj − t ∑K i=1 αi = ∑t j=1(K − t)αj − t ∑K i=t+1 αi\n≥ t(K − t)αt − t K ∑\ni=t+1\nαi ≥ t(K − t)αt − t(K − t)αt = 0\nThis completes the proof.\nAs a consequence of this theorem, we immediately get the following result.\nTheorem 26. Let f : N → N be a function computable in polynomial-time with respect to the value of its argument, such that f(K) is o(K). There is a PTAS for (K − f(K))-bestOWA-Winner.\nProof. Let us fix some ǫ, 0 < ǫ < 1. We give a polynomial time ǫ-approximation algorithm for (K − f(K))-best-OWA-Winner. Since f(K) is o(K), there is some value Kǫ such that for each K ≥ Kǫ it holds that K−f(K)\nK ≥ ǫ. If for our input instance we are to find a winner set of size K, K ≥ Kǫ, then we simply run the polynomial-time algorithm for K-best-OWA. Otherwise, we seek a winner set of size at most Kǫ and we try all subsets of items of size K. Since, in this case, K is bounded by a constant, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.\nNonetheless, both Corollary 24 and Theorem 26 have a bitter-sweet taste. In essence, they say that instead of using a particular OWA family (either Hurwicz[λ] or (K − f(K))best OWA), we might as well use a different, simpler one (1-best OWA or K-best OWA). If one wanted Hurwicz[λ] OWA or (K − f(K)-best OWA for some very important reason, then these algorithms are insufficient (though, one could interpret them as suggesting that such a very important reason is unlikely).4\nStill, Theorem 26 is a very interesting result when contrasted with Theorem 17. Theorem 26 says that there is a PTAS for α-OWA-Winner for OWA family 〈1, . . . , 1, 0〉, whereas Theorem 17 suggests that it is unlikely that there is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner with OWA family 〈0, 1, . . . , 1〉. Even though these two OWA families seem very similar, the fact that one is nonincreasing and the other one is not makes a huge difference in terms of approximability of our problem.\n4This comment applies to Hurwicz[λ] for large values of λ only."

      "text" : "We now focus on OWA-Winner with Borda-based utilities. In this case the difference between nonincreasing OWAs and those that are not is much less pronounced than in the general case (approval-based case) and very strong approximation algorithms exist. Indeed, we show PTASes for many variants of α-OWA-Winner with Borda-based utilities.\nWe start by discussing Algorithm 2, which is a generalization of an algorithm of Skowron et al. [37] for 1-best-OWA. Algorithm 2 works for nonincreasing OWAs where only some initial ℓ positions are nonzero. Recall that W(·) is Lambert’s W function, that is, a function that for x ∈ R+ satisfies the equation x = W(x)eW(x) (and, thus, W(x) is O(log(x))). The idea behind the algorithm is as follows: It proceeds in K iterations (where K is the winner-set size that we seek) and in each iteration it introduces one new item into the winner set. For each agent it considers only the top x = mW (\nK ℓ\n)\nℓ K items with highest\nutilities and in a given iteration it greedily picks an item a that maximizes the number of agents that (1) rank a among items with highest x utilities, and (2) still have “free slots” (an agent has a free slot if among the so-far-selected winners less than ℓ have utilities among the x highest ones for this agent). Below we give an example of how the algorithm works.\nExample 27. Consider the utility profile with n = 10 agents, m = 8 items a1, a2, . . . , a8, and the utilities extracted from the following preference orders using the Borda’s rule.\nagent1 : a1 ≻ a2 ≻ a3 ≻ a4 ≻ a5 ≻ a6 ≻ a7 ≻ a8\nagent2 : a2 ≻ a1 ≻ a4 ≻ a3 ≻ a7 ≻ a6 ≻ a5 ≻ a8\nagent3 : a1 ≻ a3 ≻ a7 ≻ a4 ≻ a6 ≻ a5 ≻ a8 ≻ a2\nagent4 : a2 ≻ a1 ≻ a4 ≻ a5 ≻ a3 ≻ a8 ≻ a7 ≻ a6\nagent5 : a1 ≻ a6 ≻ a5 ≻ a8 ≻ a7 ≻ a4 ≻ a2 ≻ a3\nagent6 : a3 ≻ a2 ≻ a1 ≻ a5 ≻ a4 ≻ a7 ≻ a8 ≻ a6\nagent7 : a1 ≻ a2 ≻ a6 ≻ a4 ≻ a7 ≻ a6 ≻ a8 ≻ a3\nagent8 : a1 ≻ a3 ≻ a5 ≻ a7 ≻ a8 ≻ a6 ≻ a4 ≻ a2\nagent9 : a1 ≻ a4 ≻ a3 ≻ a5 ≻ a2 ≻ a6 ≻ a7 ≻ a8\nagent10 : a8 ≻ a6 ≻ a3 ≻ a4 ≻ a5 ≻ a2 ≻ a1 ≻ a7\nSo, for example, agent1 has utility 7 for a1, utility 6 for a2, 5 for a3, and so on. We take K = 4 and we are using the 2-best OWA, so that ℓ = 2. Consequently, the algorithm will consider only the first x = ⌈mW (\nK ℓ\n)\nℓ K ⌉ = 4 positions of the agents’ rankings (W(2) ≈\n0.8562). Initially, each agent has ℓ = 2 free slots. In the first iteration, the algorithm selects an item that is most frequent among the first 4 positions of the agents’ rankings, i.e., a1. Every agent except for agent10 ranks a1 among the first 4 positions, so after the first iteration every agent except for agent10 is left with one free slot; agent10 still has 2 free slots. In the second iteration, the algorithm selects the most frequent item (excluding a1), i.e., either a3 or a4. Ties are broken arbitrarily, so let us assume that it picks a3. Every agent that ranks a3 among the first 4 positions is assigned a3 and loses one free slot. Now\nAlgorithm 2: An algorithm for nonincreasing OWAs where at most first ℓ entries are nonzero, for the case of Borda-based utilities.\nNotation: Φ ← a map defining the number of free slots per agent. Initially for each agent i we have Φ[i] = ℓ.\nx ← mW ( K ℓ ) ℓ K ; S ← ∅; for i ← 1 to K do\na ← argmaxa∈A\\S‖{j | Φ(j) > 0 ∧ posj(a) ≥ x}‖; foreach j ∈ {j | Φ(j) > 0} do if posj(a) ≥ x then\nΦ[j] ← Φ[j]− 1;\nS ← S ∪ {a}; return S\nthe agents agent4, agent5, agent7, and agent10 have one free slot left and the remaining ones have no free slots. In the third iteration, the algorithm considers only the 4 agents with free slots. The most two frequent items that are ranked among the first 4 positions by these 4 agents are a4 and a6; let us assume the algorithm picks a4. After this iteration only agent5 has a free slot. Since K = 4, the algorithm is allowed to pick one more item ranked among the first 4 positions by agent5, which is either of a5, a6, and a8. Say, the algorithm picks a5.\nTheorem 28. Fix a positive integer ℓ and let α be a nonincreasing OWA where at most first ℓ entries are nonzero. Given an instance I of α-OWA-Winner, Algorithm 2 computes a (\n1− 2W(K/ℓ)K/ℓ\n)\n-approximate solution for I in polynomial-time.\nProof. Consider an instance I of α-OWA-Winner, with n agents, m items, and where we seek a winner set of size K. Let x = mW (\nK ℓ\n)\nℓ K . Since we use an OWA, where an agent’s\ntotal utility from a winner set W depends on this agent’s utilities for the top ℓ items from W (from this agent’s point of view), we introduce the notion of free slots for each agent. Initially, each agent has ℓ free slots. Whenever an agent j has a free slot and the algorithm selects an item a such that from j’s perspective a is among x items with highest utilities, we say that a starts occupying one free slot of i. Consequently, after such item is selected, i has one free slot less.\nLet ni denote the total number of free slots of all the agents after the i-th iteration of the algorithm; n0 = ℓn. We will show by induction that ni ≤ ℓn ( 1− xℓm )i . Indeed, the inequality is true for i = 0. Let us assume that it is true for some i: ni ≤ ℓn ( 1− xℓm )i . Let Fi denote the set of agents that have free slots after iteration i. There are at least ni ℓ such agents. For j ∈ Fi, let S(j) be the number of j’s top-x items that were not included in the solution yet. If j ∈ Fi has s free slots, then S(j) = (x − ℓ+ s). Thus we have that ∑\nj∈Fi S(j) ≥ ni + (x − ℓ) ni ℓ = nix ℓ . By the pigeonhole principle, there exists an item that\nis among top-x items for at least nixℓm agents from Fi. Thus, after the (i+ 1)-th iteration of the algorithm, the total number of free slots is at most:\nni+1 ≤ ni − nix\nℓm = ni\n( 1− x\nℓm\n) ≤ ℓn ( 1− x\nℓm\n)(i+1)\nThus, at the end of the algorithm the total number of free slots is at most:\nnK ≤ ℓn ( 1− x\nℓm\n)K ≤ ℓn ( 1− x\nℓm\n)K = ℓn\n(\n1− W\n(\nK ℓ\n)\nK\n)K\n= ℓn\n(\n1\ne\n)W(K/ℓ)\n= ℓnW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ .\nThe number of occupied slots at the end of the algorithm is, thus, at least equal to (\nℓn− ℓnW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ\n)\n. Every item that occupies an agent’s slot has utility for this agent at\nleast equal to (\nm− mW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ\n)\n. Now, we will assess the OWA coefficients for the utilities\nof the items from the solution. If for some agent i the utility of an item a (ui,a) is taken with the coefficient αp (p > 1), then in the solution there must exist an item a\n′ such that ui,a′ ≥ ui,a and such that ui,a′ is taken with coefficient αp−1. Thus, there must exist at least 1 ℓ ( ℓn− ℓnW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ ) occurrences of the items with the utilities greater than ( m− mW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ ) and such that these utilities are taken with the coefficient α1. By repeating the same reasoning for the remaining occurrences of the items from the solution, we get that the total utility of the agents is lower bounded by:\n(\nℓn− ℓnW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)(\nm− mW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n1\nℓ\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi ≥ ℓnm\n(\n1− W(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)2 1\nℓ\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n≥ nm\n(\n1− 2W(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n) ℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi.\nSince the total utility of all the agents can be upper-bounded by nm ∑ℓ\ni=1 αi, we get the desired approximation ratio.\nTheorem 29. Fix a value ℓ and let α be a family of nonincreasing OWAs that have nonzero values on top ℓ positions only. There is a PTAS for α-OWA-Winner for the case of Bordabased utilities.\nProof. For every ǫ we show a polynomial algorithm with approximation ratio (1− ǫ). Consider some ǫ, 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1. There exists a value Kǫ such that for each K > Kǫ it holds that 2W(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ < ǫ. For each instance I of α-OWA-Winner where we seek winner set of size at least Kǫ, we run Algorithm 2. For the remaining cases, where the winner-set size is bounded by a constant, we use a brute-force algorithm.\nUsing the above result, we can also obtain a PTAS for OWA-Winner for geometric progression OWAs, for the case of Borda utilities. This is quite a useful result: some of our scenarios from Section 3 yield OWAs of this form.\nCorollary 30. Fix a value p > 1. There is a PTAS for gprog[p]-OWA-Winner for the case of Borda-based utilities.\nProof. Our goal is to show an algorithm that for a given value ǫ, ǫ > 0, in polynomial time outputs a (1− ǫ)-approximate solution for gprog[p]-OWA-Winner. Let us fix the value of such ǫ. The idea of our proof is to truncate the vector describing gprog[p] OWA to consider only some ℓ nonzero items on the top, where ℓ depends on ǫ only, and to run the algorithm from Theorem 29.\nFor a given number t, let St be the sum of the first t coefficients of gprog[p]. We have: St = gprog[p]t + gprog[p]t−1 + · · ·+ gprog[p]1 = pK−t + pK−(t−1) + · · ·+ pK−1 = pK−t pt−1 p−1 . We fix ℓ = ⌈logp( 2 ǫ )⌉. Now, consider the ratio r = Sℓ/SK :\nr = Sℓ SK = pK−ℓ pℓ − 1 pK − 1 > pK−ℓ pℓ − 1 pK = 1− 1 pℓ ≥ 1−\n1\nplogp( 2 ǫ ) = 1−\nǫ 2 .\nIntuitively, the above inequality says that 1− ǫ2 fraction of the total weight of gprog[p] OWA is concentrated in its first ℓ coefficients.\nLet gprog[p]|ℓ denote the OWA obtained from gprog[p] by replacing all coefficients with indices greater than ℓ with 0. Let A be a (1 − ǫ2)-approximation algorithm for gprog[p]|ℓOWA-Winner. From Theorem 29 we know that such an algorithm exists. It is easy to see that A is a (1 − ǫ)-approximation algorithm for gprog[p]-OWA-Winner. Indeed, the utility under gprog[p]|ℓ for every K-element set W is close to the utility of W under gprog[p] (recall the ~x↓ notation for sorted sequences; the inequality in the second line holds because for each i we have\n∑ℓ g=1 gprog[p]gu ↓ i,wh ≤ ∑ℓ j=1 gprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj ):\nu gprog[p] ut (W ) =\nn ∑\ni=1\nK ∑\nj=1\ngprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj\n≤ n ∑\ni=1\n\n\nℓ ∑\nj=1\ngprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj +\nK ∑\nh=ℓ+1\ngprog[p]h\n∑ℓ j=1 gprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj\n∑ℓ g=1 gprog[p]g\n\n\n=\nn ∑\ni=1\nℓ ∑\nj=1\ngprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj\n(\n1 +\n∑K h=ℓ+1 gprog[p]h\n∑ℓ g=1 gprog[p]g\n)\n≤ n ∑\ni=1\nℓ ∑\nj=1\ngprog[p]ju ↓ i,wj\n( 1 + ǫ\n2\n) = ( 1 + ǫ\n2\n)\nu gprog[p]|ℓ ut (W ).\nFrom which we get that for every W :\nu gprog[p]|ℓ ut (W ) ≥ (1−\nǫ 2 )u gprog[p] ut (W ).\nThis completes the proof because algorithm A returns a (1 − ǫ2)-approximate solution for gprog[p]|ℓ-OWA-Winner and (1− ǫ 2)(1 − ǫ 2) ≥ 1− ǫ.\nInterestingly, Theorem 29 can be generalized to the case of arbitrary OWAs (not necessarily nonincreasing) that have nonzero entries among top ℓ positions only (where ℓ is a constant.5) The idea of our algorithm is very similar to that presented as Algorithm 2, but this time we take more care in choosing the winning items, so that we ensure that a large collection of voters ranks at least ℓ winners on positions with high utility values. Specifically, we use the following lemma, which is a direct consequence of Theorem 28 (or of the algorithm for 1-best-OWA-Winner of Skowron et al. [37]).\nLemma 31. Consider a set N of n agents and a set A of m items, where the agents rank the items from the most preferred ones to the least preferred ones. Let K, ℓ, and t be some positive integers such that K ≤ m, ℓ ≤ K, and t ≤ ℓ. Let x = mW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ . There is a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a collection C of up to K/ℓ items such that there are at least n(1 − W(K/ℓ)K/ℓ ) agents that each rank at least one member of C between positions (t− 1)x+ 1 and tx.\nProof. To see that this lemma holds, it suffices to analyze the proof of Theorem 28 for p = 1 and note that the proof works equally well irrespectively of whether we consider the positions 1 through x, or x + 1 through 2x, or any other segment of x positions in the agents’ preference orders.\nTheorem 32. Fix a positive integer ℓ and let α be a family of OWAs that have nonzero entries on top ℓ positions only. There is a polynomial-time (1 − 2ℓW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ )-approximation algorithm for α-OWA-Winner for the case of Borda-based utilities.\nProof. Consider an input instance I of α-OWA-Winner with the set N = [n] of agents, with the set A of m items, and where we seek winner set of size K. We consider the agents’ utilities to be represented by preference orders over A (recall the discussion of Borda-based utilities in Section 2.1 and the fact that we can decode these preference orders from the Borda-based utilities of the agents). Let α = 〈α1, . . . , αℓ, 0, . . . , 0〉 be the OWA used in this instance. We set x = mW(K/ℓ)K/ℓ .\nOur algorithm proceeds in ℓ iterations. We set N (0) = N and n(0) = n. In the i-th iteration, 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, the algorithm operates as follows: Using the algorithm from Lemma 31, we find a set A(i) of up to K/ℓ items such that at least n(i−1)(1− W(K/ℓ)K/ℓ ) of the agents from the set N (i−1) each rank at least one of these items among positions (i− 1)x+ 1, . . . , ix of their preference orders. We let N (i) be the set of these agents and we set n(i) = ‖N (i)‖. Finally, we set W =\n⋃ℓ i=1A (i) and return W as the set of winners (it is easy to see that W contains at most K items; if K contains fewer than K items then we supplement it with K − ‖W‖ arbitrarily chosen ones).\n5However, if one reads our proof carefully, it is clear that it generalizes to some values of ℓ that depend\non K, but which are sufficiently small; e.g., it works for ℓ = K 1 3 ).\nBy the construction of our algorithm, each of the agents from the set N (ℓ) ranks at least ℓ items from the set W on positions no worse than ℓx. Thus the total utility that the agents from the set N derive from the solution W is at least:\nn(ℓ)\n(\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n)\n(m− xℓ).\nThis is so, because for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ ℓ, each of the agents in the set N (ℓ) derives utility αi(m− xℓ) from the agent that he ranks as i’th best among the items from W .\nBy construction of our algorithm, we have:\nn(ℓ) ≥ n\n(\n1− W(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)ℓ\n≥ n\n(\n1− ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n.\nThus, the total utility obtained by the agents is at least:\nuαut(W ) ≥ n\n(\n1− ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n(\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n)\n(m− xℓ)\n= n\n(\n1− ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n(\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n)\n(\nm− ℓ mW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n= nm\n(\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n)\n(\n1− ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)(\n1− ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\n≥ nm\n(\nℓ ∑\ni=1\nαi\n)\n(\n1− 2ℓW(K/ℓ)\nK/ℓ\n)\nNow, since the maximum possible total utility of all the agents is upper-bounded by nm(\n∑ℓ i=1 αi), we have that our algorithm has approximation ratio (1 − 2ℓW(K/ℓ) K/ℓ ). It is\nclear that it runs in polynomial time, and so the proof is complete.\nBased on Theorem 32, we can immediately generalize Theorem 29.\nTheorem 33. Fix a value ℓ and let α be a family of OWAs that have nonzero values on top ℓ positions only. There is a PTAS for α-OWA-Winner for the case of Borda-based utilities.\nIt is interesting to compare Theorems 28 and 32. Even though the latter one covers a larger set of cases, the algorithm it implies achieves a notably weaker approximation ratio (even if still sufficient to obtain a PTAS). This shows that OWAs that are not nonincreasing are harder to deal with even for Borda-based utilities (even if the difference is much smaller than in the general case). Theorems 32 and 33 are also quite interesting in conjunction with Theorem 17. In particular, they show that it seems impossible to generalize Theorem 17 to the case of Borda-based utilities. It might be surprising at first, because it was possible to\ngeneralize Theorem 7 to the case of Borda utilities (as Theorem 8) and, indeed, the main ideas of these proofs are similar.\nIt is also interesting to note that there is nothing in the proofs of Theorems 28 and 32 that would stop us from using them for the case where ℓ depends on K. In particular, Theorem 28 still gives an approximation ratio higher than 1 − 1e of the greedy algorithm even for K10 -best OWA. For the case, of Theorem 32, it stays useful (i.e., still yields even a PTAS) for values of ℓ in O(K0.5−ǫ), for each positive ǫ (the same is true for Theorem 28 as long as ℓ(K) is such that W(K/ℓ(K))K/ℓ(K) goes to 0 when K goes to ∞)."

      "text" : "Weighing intrinsic values by coefficients that are a function of their rank in a list is of course not new. Ordered Weighted Average operators have been used extensively in multicriteria decision making, and to a lesser extent in social choice [23]; the vector of values then corresponds to criteria (in MCDM) or to agents (in social choice). Also, studying rankdependent expected utility (RDEU) [33] is a well-known research stream in decision theory, whose starting point is the construction of models that explain Allais’ paradox: given a set of possible consequences of an act, the contribution of a possible consequence on the agent’s RDEU is a function of its probability and of its rank in the list of consequences ordered by decreasing probability. Whereas these three research streams use ranks to modify the contribution of a criterion, an agent, or a possible consequence, in our setting they modify the contribution of items, our final aim being to select an optimal set of items. Because we don’t select criteria, agents or possible consequences, it is not obvious how our results can apply to these three aforementioned research fields.\nSeveral known settings are recovered as particular cases of our general model. In particular, this applies to some proportional representation schemes [13] and to (variants of) the budgeted social choice model [27]. Computational complexity of these proportional representation schemes was first studied by Procaccia et al. [32]; the parametrized complexity of the problem was analyzed by Betzler et al. [4]. The first approximation algorithm was proposed by Lu and Boutilier [27]. These results on approximability were then extended in several directions by Skowron et al. [37].\nGroup recommender systems (see, e.g., the work of O’Connor et al. [31] for one of the first approaches, and the surveys of Jameson and Smyth [22] and of Masthoff [28]) aim at recommending sets or sequences of items (such as a set of television programs or a sequence of songs) to a group of users, based on preferences of all group members. Two mainstream approaches have been developed (see [22]): those based on the construction of an ‘average user’ whose preferences are built by aggregating the preferences of individuals in the group, and those based on producing individual recommendations and aggregating them. Unlike these, our approach (which recommends sets, but not yet sequences) proceeds in a single step, and enables a fine-tuning of the contribution of an item to each user’s utility depending on the number of better items (for that user) in the list.\nFacility location problem (fl) is closely related to 1-best-OWA-Winner. In fl, how-\never, the goal is to minimize the dissatisfaction of the agents instead of maximizing their utility (satisfaction). Although, as far as exact solutions are concerned both formulations are equivalent, there is a significant difference in the quality of approximation (the difference between approximation guarantees for the maximization and minimization formulations of 1-best-OWA-Winner for Borda utilities is described by Skowron et al. [37]). Some works focus on general dissatisfaction functions [19], but most of the results were established for dissatisfactions corresponding to the distances, and thus satisfying the triangle inequality [21,35]. Also, in fl the goal is to minimize the dissatisfaction of the worst-off agent (the egalitarian view). The utilitarian version of the problem is called k-median [21]. The parametrized complexity of the problem was analyzed by Fellows and Fernau [19]. The approximation algorithms include [14,21,35]. Interestingly, a local-search algorithm (which, to the best of our knowledge, is the best known approximation algorithm for the capacitated\nversion of fl [14]) is also a 12 -approximation algorithm for maximizing nondecreasing submodular functions [30], and thus for OWA-Winner with non-decreasing utility functions. We conclude that it would be interesting to compare the algorithms for fl and k-median with different algorithms for OWA-Winner on real preference traces [29]."

      "heading" : "6 Summary",
      "text" : "Our contribution is twofold. First, we have proposed a new model for the selection of a collective sets of items; this model appears to be very general, encompasses several known frameworks, and can be applied to various domains such as committee elections, group recommendation, and beyond. Second, we have investigated the computational feasibility of the model, depending on the various assumptions we can make about the agents’ utilities and the choice of the OWA vector. Table 1 gives a summary of our results. We note that many of these results directly related to the OWA families that appear in the settings from Section 3, that were our motivating force.\nSome of our results look negative, while some others (especially in the case of Borda utilities) are on the positive side. However, the way the results should be interpreted depends on the application domain. In political elections and other high-stake domains, is makes sense to use an approximation algorithm only if it viewed as defining a new, full-fledged voting rule, which may enjoy many desirable properties (on this point see [11,12,16,37]); but it is arguably not reasonable to use an approximation algorithm (even with a good performance guarantee) if it is viewed as nothing more than an approximation algorithm of another rule, and it is even less reasonable to use a heuristic search algorithm (when there is no good approximation algorithm); this implies that using this model for political elections is feasible when the number of candidates is small enough, but can become problematic beyond that (unless we define the approximation algorithm to be the new voting rule, as said above). On the other hand, in low-stake applications domains (which can include some committee elections, and of course group recommender systems), it may become perfectly reasonable, and in that case, even NP-hardness and inapproximability results should not discourage us to use the model; they only tell that we may have to resort to heuristic search algorithms, which is one of the interesting directions for further research.\nOur research leads to many open problems. In particular, one might want to strengthen our approximation algorithms, provide algorithms for more general cases, provide more inapproximability results. Among these problems, a particularly interesting one regards the approximability of OWA-Winner for the arithmetic progression family of OWAs. For this case, our set of results is very limited. In particular, can one provide a PTAS for arithmeticprogression OWAs under Borda-based utilities? Can one do so for K2 -best OWAs/K-median OWAs?"

    "abstractText" : "We consider the following problem: There is a set of items (e.g., movies) and a group of agents (e.g., passengers on a plane); each agent has some intrinsic utility for each of the items. Our goal is to pick a set of K items that maximize the total derived utility of all the agents (i.e., in our example we are to pick K movies that we put on the plane’s entertainment system). However, the actual utility that an agent derives from a given item is only a fraction of its intrinsic one, and this fraction depends on how the agent ranks the item among available ones (in the movie example, the perceived value of a movie depends on the values of the other ones available). Extreme examples of our model include the setting where each agent derives utility from his or her most preferred item only (e.g., an agent will watch his or her favorite movie only), from his or her least preferred item only (e.g., the agent worries that he or she will be somehow forced to watch the worst available movie), or derives 1/K of the utility from each of the available items (e.g., the agent will pick a movie at random). Formally, to model this process of adjusting the derived utility, we use the mechanism of ordered weighted average (OWA) operators. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a formal specification of the model and provide concrete examples and settings where particular OWA operators are applicable. Second, we show that, in general, our problem is NP-hard but—depending on the OWA operator and the nature of agents’ utilities—there exist good, efficient approximation algorithms (sometimes even polynomial time approximation schemes). Interestingly, our results generalize and build upon those for proportional represented in multiwinner voting scenarios.",
