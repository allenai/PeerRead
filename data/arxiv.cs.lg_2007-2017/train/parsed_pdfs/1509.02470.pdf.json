Among them, a lot of\n∗This work was done when the first author was working as intern at Intel Labs China under the supervision of the second author.\nresearches adopt pre-trained CNN models as feature extractor for various visual recognition tasks like object detection [12], object recognition [9, 25, 6], image retrieval [13, 25], etc. Features are usually from different CNN layer activations or outputs. To achieve advanced and robust performance, people either fine-tune the pre-trained CNN models on their own tasks, or make extensively data augmentation to get robust classifiers. These developed techniques have shown promising results in comparison to conventional methods using standard feature representations like bag-of-words [29], sparse-coding [34], etc. However, there are two limitations of these kind of methods. First, neural codes from middle-layer are difficult to explain. Second, neural code extraction from whole image definitely loss many context information. These two are summarized to be the well-known semantic gap [30].\nMeanwhile, region features are appealing on recognition task. For instance, Gu et al. [14] employ mid-level features like contour shape, edge shape, color and texture to describe each region for visual recognition tasks. It is well known that region features can naturally preserve more mid-level semantic information like materials, textures, shapes, etc of objects [11]. However, traditional region representations either highly depend on segmentation algorithm [3, 23], or lack of a generic semantic representation for regions for various visual recognition tasks.\nTo address these challenges and leverage the power from\n1\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n02 47\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 8\nS ep\n2 01\nboth richness and semantics of these two types of feature representations, in this paper, we propose to integrate the semantic output, i.e., the output from the soft-max layer of CNN models, as well as region proposals to achieve compact yet effective visual representations, namely deep attribute (DA). Since the soft-max layer neural codes are the probability response to the categories on which CNNs are trained, it is fairly compact, semantic, and sparse due to insignificant responses to most categories. Briefly, the proposed method contains four key components.\n(1) We introduce region proposals using algorithm like selective search [31] or edge-box [35] from each input image.\n(2) We feed each extracted regions to CNN models to compute neural codes from soft-max layer.\n(3) We perform cross-region-pooling of regional neural codes to obtain a holistic yet compact representation of the image.\n(4) We observe that only a small portion of region proposals are correlated to classification target, thus we impose learned classifier feedback to pick out a few contextual regions and re-pooling to get a context-aware classifier.\nThe major difference to traditional off-the-shelf CNN methods are illustrated in Figure 1, while the proposed approach is further illustrated in details in Figure 2. To capture more context information related to scale, we also study different pooling layout schemes like multi-scale-pooling and spatial pyramid-pooling extensions.\nTo demonstrate the capacity and robustness of the proposed technique, we employ deep attributes on three visual recognition tasks: image classification, fine-grained object recognition, and visual instance retrieval. Experimental results on several standard benchmark datasets show that deep attributes can achieve state-of-the-arts performance. Especially, the context-aware region refining (CARR) algorithm\nclearly outperforms peer methods with a significant margin. In summary, the major contributions of this paper include: • We propose a deep attribute approach for visual recognition\ntasks, which is equipped with the semantic power from the outputs of pre-trained CNN models, as well as the compactness of region proposals.\n• We present schemes to utilize contextual information among region proposals. The context-aware region refining algorithm yield large performance gains.\n• Experimental results on three different visual recognition tasks clearly show the superiority of the proposed method, as well as the generalization ability to different vision tasks.\nIn the rest of the paper, we will first give a brief survey on related works in Section 2, and then present the details of the proposed deep attribute approach in Section 3. In Section 4, we conduct experiments to study different aspects of setting which will impact the performance of the algorithm. We show experimental results on three visual recognition tasks on Section 5. Conclusions and discussions are given in Section 6."

      "heading" : "2. Related Works",
      "text" : "In this section, we will briefly revisit related works from the following four aspects. CNN methods:. Since the breakthrough success of CNN models on ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012 [20], employing CNN models to other vision tasks becomes popular in the computer vision community. Razavian et al. [25] evaluate the performance of CNN features on several vision tasks, including object recognition, fine-grained object recognition, and image retrieval. Meanwhile, DeCAF [9] also shows that CNN features work surprisingly well on image classification. Subsequently, Babenko et al [5] present a similar idea on im-\nage retrieval with fine-tuning on self-collected datasets to further improve retrieval accuracy. In addition, they adopt PCA to compress neural-codes for efficient search. All these methods adopt the neural code activation from the first full-connected layer.\nAttribute methods: Attribute methods adopt discriminative outputs of multi-class classifiers as mid-level features for visual recognition tasks. In face recognition, Kuma et al. [21] consider the labels of reference faces and facecomponents as attributes to describe other faces. Farhadi et al. [11] describe objects using 64 explicitly semantic attribute classifiers. However, it remains as an open challenge to exploit the discriminative output of CNNs to solve generic vision tasks.\nPooling strategy: Pooling is a general strategy to augment features. As one of the most well known work, spatial pyramid matching performs pooling over pyramid of regular grids [22, 34]. Gong et al. [13] encodes the activations of CNN fully connected layer by VLAD [18], and then concatenates the encoded features over windows at three scale levels. Most of these pooling methods simply concatenate features from different grids of scales. On the contrary, decision-level cross-region pooling has been applied when there are multiple region/patch candidates [27, 32]. In our work, since we use the semantic output of CNNs as regional features, it is fairly straightforward to perform pooling across different region proposals.\nRegion proposals: Methods for detecting region proposal are used in object detection to avoid exhaustive sliding window search across images and speed up the detection without noticeable loss of recall rates [12]. In general, region proposal detection is based on low-level features and visual cues to measure objectness of local regions to generate relatively fewer candidate windows. In the past few years, there have been extensive studies on this topic and many techniques are invented, including selective search [31], edge-boxes [35], BING [7], multiscale combinatorial grouping (MCG) [4], and so on. Recently, Jan Hosang et al. [16] evaluates ten region proposal methods, in which selective search and edge-boxes achieved consistently better performance in terms of ground truth recall, repeatability, and detection speed. Hence, we may employ them to produce region proposals as the first step of our deep attribute method."

      "heading" : "3. Deep Attribute with Regional Neural Codes",
      "text" : "The proposed deep attribute method consists of the following four steps.\n(1) Region proposals extraction: We use advanced techniques like selective search [31] or edge-boxes [35] to extract semantical regions, as both of which show satisfactory performance in benchmarks [16].\n(2) Computing of neural codes for region proposals: We use CNN models trained from 1000 categories of ILSVRC 2012 to produce 1000 dimensional semantic output for each extracted region proposals. Such computed neural codes will serve as the semantic input for the next pooling stage.\n(3) Cross-region-pooling: We make pooling per dimension across extracted regions to get a 1000-dimensional holistic representations. Different pooling layout schemes are applicable for further possible performance improvement.\n(4) Context-aware region refining and classifier build: A linear classifier can be trained over deep attribute representations for visual recognition tasks. We observed that only a small portion of regions are correlated to classification targets. We thus impose classifier feedback to pick out a few contextual regions and re-pooling to get a context-aware classifier.\nThe first two steps are easy to understand. We will describe the latter two items in details below."

      "heading" : "3.1. Cross Region Pooling (CRP)",
      "text" : "Given image I , a set of object region proposals {R1, R2, ..., RN} are extracted by region detection algorithms like [31, 35]. Then the regions are wrapped and feed to CNN models. Each region Ri is thus represented by the output from soft-max layer as Fi = (fi1, · · · , fiK), where fik is the k-th dimensional neural code of Fi. The computed neural codes of all the regions are then aggregated with a pooling operation to construct a holistic representation of the input image I . The pooling could be either maxpooling or average-pooling. In our practice, we find maxpooling works better than average-pooling when do pooling over all region proposals. Thus, the final code for the k-th dimension f̂k is obtained as f̂k = maxNi=1{fik}. Figure 2 illustrates the details of the pooling scheme. Since the CNN models are trained on 1000 categories, we derive a 1000 dimensional deep attribute after this pooling procedure.\nAs the single-scale cross-region-pooling does not consider the layout of regions across scales (like the person and the horse in Figure 2), we may further enhance it with different pooling layout scheme. This paper studies two layout schemes: multi-scale pooling scheme or spatial pyramid pooling scheme. In multi-scale pooling, we divide the regions into different scale-interval groups, perform pooling over the regions within each group independently, and then concatenate the deep attributes from each group together, yielding a final holistical representation of the image. Particularly, the scale of a region is defined as the ratio of its area proportional to the area of the whole image, or the area of the image bounding box when available. In our experiments, we use five scale-intervals, which are (0, 116 ],( 1 16 , 1 8 ],( 1 8 , 1 4 ],( 1 4 , 1 2 ] and ( 1 2 , 1]. Therefore, the final representation is a 5000-dimension deep attribute feature. In contrast, spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) divides the whole image into 1x1, 2x2 and 4x4 grids, and make cross-region-\npooling in each grid, and then concatenate features together for a holistic representation."

      "heading" : "3.2. Context Aware Region Refining (CARR)",
      "text" : "Region proposal algorithms usually produce thousands of regions for input images to ensure high recall rate [16]. For a certain classification task, we observed that extracted regions could be divided into three categories. First, some regions are directly related to the classification target. Second, some regions can be viewed as useful context information. Third, some regions belong to background clutter, which has little relationship to the classification task. For instance, for a horse classification in Figure 3, the horse region is target region, and the human region can be viewed as a context region, while the car region is certainly background noise. To improve the accuracy, we should maximally exploit the context information, while suppress the clutter information. Note that the background clutter regions are category specific. Again in Figure 3, for car classification, the horse region is background noise. This inspires us imposing classifier feedback information to pick out category-specific context regions. We therefore propose a context-aware region refining (CARR) algorithm based on this observation.\nSuppose linear classifier hc(x) = W c ∗ x is trained from features x by cross-region-pooling for category c. Given image I , region proposal algorithm extracted N regions, and region Rk is represented by semantical neural codes Fk. We define a score for region Rk as\nSck = h c(Fk) = w c · Fk. (1)\nThe larger the score is, the higher the region correlated to category c. A region is defined as category-c contextual region if only if Sck > θ.\nIn practice, for each image I and category c, we rank the regions according to their score Sck. We then pick top-K regions as contextual regions, and apply cross-region-pooling on these top-K regions again to get a new holistic representation for each category separately. A refined linear classifier for category c is then learned on these updated repre-\nsentations. This procedure can be run iteratively to refine both context regions and linear classifiers.\nSuppose we run the procedure with T iterations, we thus have T classifiers {hct(x)}Tt=1 for each category c. Intuitively, we can directly use the final classifier hcT (x). However, classifier ensemble may bring more accuracy gains. We can fuse hct(x) together as\nHcT (x) = ∑T\nt=1 αth\nc t(x) = ∑T t=1 αtw c t · x, (2)\nwhere αt is a weight coefficient for t-th classifier. Empirically, αt can be estimated by grid search in a crossvalidation manner. Since this fusion is similar to boosting, we give αt estimation followed by the AdaBoost rule as\nαt = log 1− Et Et , (3)\nwhere Et is the classification error on training set at t-th iteration. Algorithm 1 lists the training procedure.\nIn the testing phase, we applyHcT (x) on each image, and do context-aware region refining based on classifier label. Algorithm 2 lists the detailed testing procedure.\nAlgorithm 1: Learning CARR Classifier Data: For each image I , given regions {Rk}I and\ncorresponding soft-max output {Fk}I for t = 1:T do\nfor each category c do for each image I do\nfor each region Rk do Compute Sck(Fk) = H c t−1(Fk); end Sort Sck in descending order; Pick top-K regions from all N regions; Cross-region-pooling on top-K regions; Get new representation FI ;\nend Train new linear classifier hct(x) based on {FI}; Compute error-rate Et for hct(x); Update Hct according to Eq. 2;\nend end Result: Output fused classifier HcT (x)."

We make experiments based on the Caffe deep learning framework [19]. It should be highlighted here that we do not make any data augmentation at all. For each region, we only feed the single center cropping into CNN for computing neural-codes output. Besides, we did not fine-tune the CNN model on the given datasets.

Alex’s net achieves 80.8% mAP on 20 categories of VOC 2007, while VGG’s net achieves 85.6% mAP. It is obvious that VGG’s net outperforms Alex’s net with a big margin.

Figure 5(a) illustrates recall rate with respect to number of top-regions on PASCAL VOC 2007 by\nboth selective search and edge box. This graph is generated in the following way. Since PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset gives object bounding box annotations, we employ selective search or edge-box to generate a set of region proposals and sort them according to region scores. Then, we pick topK regions, and compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) rate (IoU) using top-K regions with the ground truth. One region is counted as a recall when the IoU is larger than 0.5. Changing the value of K, we got the graph. From this graph, we can see that edge-box works slightly better than selective search.\nA single scale VGG’s net is adopted in this study with max-pooling for region aggregation. All the generated region proposals are used in cross-region-pooling. Selective search achieves 85.6% mAP on VOC 2007, while edge box achieves 86.1% mAP. This shows edge box works slightly better than selective search, and is consistent with results in Figure 5(a). Specially, edge box is more than 20 times faster than selective search.

Single-scale makes cross-region-pooling (CRP) over the whole image. Spatial-pyramid-pooling divides the whole image into 1x1 grids, 2x2 grids plus one center grid. It makes CRP on each grid, and then concatenates features from each grid together. Multi-scale-pooling makes CRP over five different region scales according to region size proportion to image size. Features from different scales are concatenated together to a holistic representation. In this study, we adopt VGG’s net with max-pooling. Experiments show that single-scale achieves 86.1% mAP, spatialpyramid-pooling achieves 87.2% mAP, and the multi-scale pooling achieves 89.7% mAP. Hence, multi-scale pooling outperforms other pooling scheme with a big margin. As spatial-pyramid-pooling does no show advantages over multi-scale case, we will not take it into consideration in future studies.\nSecond, we compare max-pooling to average-pooling\nunder both single-scale layout and multi-scale layout. In single-scale case, max-pooling achieves 86.1% mAP, while average-pooling achieves 87.3% mAP. In the multi-scale case, max-pooling achieves 89.7% mAP, while average pooling achieves 89.3% mAP.

Figure 4 illustrates the results on both single-scale case and multi-scale case. We can conclude that (1) In multiscale case, max-pooling consistently outperform averagingpooling on different layers, while DA (soft-max) layer achieves 89.7% mAP, which beats all the other layers on both max-pooling and average-pooling; (2) In single-scale case, max-pooling outperforms averaging-pooling on all layers except for the soft-max layer. Soft-max layer with average-pooling performs the best over all the other layers in this case.\nAs superb accuracy reached by soft-max layers and relative lower dimensionality (1000 for single scale, 5000 for multi-scale), we choose soft-max layer and multi-scale pooling in the proposed framework."

We pick top-K regions according to their region score for the multi-scale cross-region-pooling. For different K value, we get the accuracy on VOC 2007. The results are shown in Figure 5(b). It shows that more regions is better, and when the number of regions exceed 500, the\naccuracy is saturated.

As the number of total regions N usually larger than 1500, that means there are usually about 40 context regions picked out for each image and each category. Besides, we observed that only one iteration of context region refining will bring 3.6% accuracy improvement for single scale deep attributes (from 86.1% to 89.7%), while bring 1.1% accuracy improvement for the multi-scale case (from 89.7% to 90.8%).

We also study the impact from max-pooling and average-pooling in the refining step. Figure 7 illustrates the comparison results.\nIt is obvious that average-pooling works better than maxpooling in the refining step. This is different from the global CRP step. The reason is that the global CRP step contains all the regions which may contain many background clutter noise regions; while in the refining step, most noise regions are suppressed.

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and Discussions",
      "text" : "To handle semantic gap of global CNN feature representation, this paper propose the deep attribute framework to alleviate the issue from three aspects. First, we introduce semantic region proposals as an intermedia to represent images. Second, we show that aggregating soft-max output from region proposals with cross-region max-pooling yields best accuracy among all different CNN feature layers. The soft-max output (aka, deep attributes) is interpretable yet compact. Third, we introduce context-aware region refining algorithm to pick out classification target related regions, and build context-aware classifiers.\nTo corroborate the effectiveness, we use the deep attribute as generic feature representation on various vision tasks. Our empirical studies show that the proposed approach outperforms the competing methods with a large margin. The reason for success is due to at least three factors. First, the region proposals are good alignment to target objects. Second, cross-region max-pooling will suppress most noise regions, while keep most meaningful regions. Third, the context region refining will keep only those those highly correlated regions while suppress most possible background noise regions.\nDeep attributes have several good properties. Here we discussion some of them. First, the deep attribute representation can be easily interpreted. We can backtrack each attribute (per feature dimension) to region proposal which produce this attribute, as the aggregation is done by maxpooling. We can also identify the most discriminant region\nfor each image and category by sorting region score Sk from Eq.1. Figure 8 shows more examples of the most discriminative region for each image in a red bounding box.\nSecond, deep attribute can be applied to a wide range of compute vision tasks. Especially, even the deep attribute is obtained from CNN model trained from ImageNet, it can be employed to those tasks which has fairly different object concepts from that of ImageNet. For instance, in the experiment for fine grained flower recognition, the flower dataset has little category overlap with the ImageNet 1000 categories; as well as the Holiday and UKB dataset in image retrieval task. As discussed above, Figure 8 illustrates the most discriminative region associated with each semantic category for the samples from both the PASCAL VOC and flower datasets. It is obvious that regions in PASCAL VOC samples reflect more semantic meanings, while this is not true for flower samples. This is due to the fact that PASCAL VOC has more semantic concepts overlap with that of ImageNet than flowers dataset. This phenomenon also inspires us to explore more things behind deep attributes. For instance, how many attributes are sufficient to support generic visual recognition tasks? Could we find a minimum supporting attribute set for visual recognition? Future works will make further exploration on it.\nThird, in Figures 2, we can see that the extracted deep attribute representation is somewhat sparse. We could make the representation even sparse by shrinking the deep attribute with a pre-defined threshold. Such a property is extremely useful for large-scale vision system, because a sparse representation can bring benefits in both storage and execution speed.\nThe proposed approach has several aspects to be im-\nproved. First, there are large space for execution efficiency improvement. Currently, it runs about 5∼10s per image on NVidia Titan X GPU. Second, the accuracy and robustness could be further improved with fine-tuning on given dataset. An interesting future direction is to design an unified framework to consider these two points together."

    "abstractText" : "Recently, many researches employ middle-layer output of convolutional neural network models (CNN) as features for different visual recognition tasks. Although promising results have been achieved in some empirical studies, such type of representations still suffer from the well-known issue of semantic gap. This paper proposes so-called deep attribute framework to alleviate this issue from three aspects. First, we introduce object region proposals as intermedia to represent target images, and extract features from region proposals. Second, we study aggregating features from different CNN layers for all region proposals. The aggregation yields a holistic yet compact representation of input images. Results show that cross-region max-pooling of soft-max layer output outperform all other layers. As softmax layer directly corresponds to semantic concepts, this representation is named “deep attributes”. Third, we observe that only a small portion of generated regions by object proposals algorithm are correlated to classification target. Therefore, we introduce context-aware region refining algorithm to pick out contextual regions and build contextaware classifiers. We apply the proposed deep attributes framework for various vision tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on standard benchmarks for three visual recognition tasks, i.e., image classification, fine-grained recognition and visual instance retrieval. Results show that deep attribute approaches achieve state-of-the-art results, and outperforms existing peer methods with a significant margin, even though some benchmarks have little overlap of concepts with the pre-trained CNN models.",
