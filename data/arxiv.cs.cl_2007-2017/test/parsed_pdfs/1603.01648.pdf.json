      "text" : "Propositions, statements for which a truth value can be assigned (e.g., “Bob loves Mary”), constitute the primary unit of information conveyed in texts. Accordingly, recognizing and matching proposition structure is a central component in systems and algorithms that attempt to extract semantic information from text, such as question answering, summarization, or recognizing textual entailment, collectively referred as semantic applications.\nSeveral practices exist for recovering the proposition structure of sentences. Dependency trees (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008b) are attractive as they directly connect verbal predicates to their arguments, while deep syntax extensions of dependency trees also mark long distance dependencies, further broadening predicate-argument coverage (Ballesteros et al., 2014). Other annotations choose a more semantic approach. Notable examples are Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Carreras\nand Màrquez, 2005a), which extracts frames linking predicates with their semantic arguments, or, more recently, Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013), which aims to extract a graph representation capturing the semantic structure of the sentence.\nCurrently, dependency trees are perhaps the most commonly used representation, mainly for the high accuracy with which they can be obtained, in contrast to the relatively lower performance for current SRL systems and AMR parsers.\nDespite the attractive properties of (deep) dependency parses, it is quite hard to read out from them the complete structure of all propositions expressed in a sentence, for several reasons: (1) Different predications are represented in a non-uniform manner (e.g, passive vs. active, verbal vs. adjectival predication, appositions vs. copula) (2) Proposition boundaries are not easy to detect; and (3) Substantial parts of the dependency structure represent syntactic detail that is not core to proposition structure. For these reasons, it is common for NLP systems to tailor sets of rules and heuristics to unify and extract specific information from the parse structure. While these heuristics are created mostly in an ad-hoc manner and differ from application to application (e.g., (Culotta and Sorensen, 2004)), the possibility of creating such heuristics rests on rather strong linguistic grounds – the syntactic structure reliably expresses a wide range of predications. This stands in contrast with the deeper analysis required in order to obtain semantic annotations such as AMR or SRL, which are not readily attainable from syntax.\nOur goal in this work is to alleviate the need for tailoring such heuristic post-processing of parse trees on a case by case basis. We do this by provid-\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n01 64\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nM ar\n2 01\ning a convenient output format which directly represents the proposition structure that can be induced from syntax, while following several desired design principles. In particular, we uniformly represent propositions headed by different types of predicates, verbal or not. We canonicalize different syntactic constructions that correspond to the same proposition structure, and decouple independent propositions while clearly marking proposition boundaries. Finally, the scheme masks non-core syntactic detail, yielding cleaner compact structures. Overall, we enable simple access to the represented propositions by a uniform graph traversal, offering an appealing alternative input to common uses of dependency structures.\nWe bundle an implementation of these principles in PROPS (Proposition Structure) – an automatic converter which takes as input Stanford dependency trees, and outputs proposition structures with our notation. In most cases. PROPS stays close to the syntactic level, keeping the relatively high accuracy and robustness levels currently attainable by syntactic parsing, while still providing a significant improvement over the bare syntactic structure for downstream semantic processing. In some other cases, where information is currently not reliably produced by automatic parsers (such as difficult conjunctions or differentiating between raising and control), PROPS applies a set of heuristics to obtain the output structure. We demonstrate the out-of-thebox attractiveness of PROPS on a reading comprehension task.\nIn addition to providing an automatic tool to convert dependency trees we also provide a large semiautomatic annotation of the WSJ portion of the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) (Bies et al., 1995). This recovers our structures with higher accuracy, and includes an accurate handling for the previously mentioned semantically hard decisions. We do so by utilizing gold phrase-based annotations and other annotated resources, such as Propbank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2003) or Vadas and Curran’s (2007) NP structure annotation. We intrinsically test the quality of our predicted structures over the PTB by measuring their accuracy against a small manually annotated subset.\nBy identifying and clearly enumerating the typical properties that semantic applications would need from syntactic structures, we hope to trigger re-\nsearch on an application-oriented syntactic middleground, as opposed to current mostly ad-hoc and under-documented post-processing solutions."

      "heading" : "2 Design Principles",
      "text" : "We focus our output representation around the proposition structure needed for semantic applications, instead of the syntactic focus of dependency trees. To that end, we suggest five desired structural principles that we find missing or lacking in dependency trees. This section presents these principles, as well as consequent formulation of the PROPS output format. The next two sections describe the corresponding dependency tree conversions implemented in PROPS. Section 3 describes the bigger bulk of conversions. These can be realized with high precision in a principled way from dependency trees attainable from current dependency parsers. Few cases, in which we applied heuristics to address some harder decisions, are described in Section 4.\nMasking non-core syntactic detail (Section 3.1) We want to focus the application on the semantic components of the sentence. While dependency trees are often over specified, and include a node for every token, we would like to remove auxiliary words and instead encode their syntactic function as features in a canonicalized way. Additionally, we would like to group atomic units (such as noun compounds) within a single node.\nRepresenting propositions in a uniform manner (Section 3.2) We would like the application to uniformly access a wide range of propositions, headed by different types of predicates, unlike the verbcentric representation of input dependency trees.\nCanonicalizing and differentiating syntactic constructions (Sections 3.3, 4.1) To ease the semantic handling for downstream applications, we want our structures to (1) Unify the representation of propositions which are semantically equivalent, yet look different in dependency trees, due to syntactic subtleties, and (2) Differentiate syntacticallysimilar, yet semantically-different, constructions.\nMarking proposition boundaries (Section 3.4) Clearly marking the minimal span of a standalone proposition and its elements (predicate, arguments, and modifiers) is beneficial for semantic tasks (e.g.,\n(Angeli et al., 2015)), and not trivially available in depdendency trees.\nPropagating Relations (Section 4.2) We would like that every relation which is inferable through parse tree traversal (for instance, through conjunctions) would be explicitly marked in our representation. This way we can save an application the need to perform subsequent passes and propagations over the input representation."

      "heading" : "2.1 Output Format",
      "text" : "To achieve our desired principles, we choose a representation format that resembles dependency structures, with the following changes:\nTyped nodes In order to clearly identify the propositions in our structures, we differentiate between two types of nodes (compared with syntactic dependencies, where there is only one type of nodes): (1) Predicates, which evoke a proposition and (2) Non-predicates, which can be either arguments or modifiers. Additionally, we delegate function words, such as modality and tense, to features of nodes.\nFigure 1 depicts the sentence “Barack Obama, the young candidate, was elected president” in dependency representation (top) verus PROPS output (bottom). PROPS clearly marks the predicates elect, young and SameAs (representing apposition) as shaded nodes in the graph, along with their features (for instance, past tense indicated in subscript for the predicate elect), and their direct arguments and modifiers.\nBreaking the correspondence between nodes and words We simplify the graph structure by allowing multi-word nodes (e.g., Barack Obama), versus having each node corresponding to a single word in dependency trees. In some cases (as in the SameAs node), nodes do not correspond to specific words in the sentence (see Section 3.2).\nGraph Structure Similar to the deep variant of dependency trees, our resulting structures are no longer limited to trees. Instead, our structures are directed graphs, as seen in Figure 1.\nFocused edge label set In order to further simplify the reading of the graph, we introduce a label set of 14 relations (compared with approximately 50 in Stanford dependencies). These enable the user to focus on a more general set of relations between the proposition elements. See table 1 for the complete inventory, along with an index to examples in the paper."

      "text" : "In addition to single word nodes, we produce structures containing multi-word nodes, for cases of multi-word predicates (e.g., take a picture) or noun compounds (e.g., New York). In certain syntactic formalisms, these constructs are represented as multiple nodes joined by some designated label. In particular, PROPS relies on the nn and mwe relations in Stanford dependencies for noun phrases and multiword expressions, respectively. Joining such entities in a single node reduces the size of the tree, reduces the label set, and overall simplifies its processing.\nAdditionally, we write words in their base form and encode features for modality, negation, definiteness, tense, and passive or active voice for each node in a flat key=value structure (e.g., “was elected” appears as a single elect node with a past tense feature in Figure 1). Recovering such properties can be done with high accuracy based on lexical and syntactic cues in a few deterministic rules (see Section 7.1 for an intrinsic evaluation). These feature encodings provide abstraction over the different ways in which the features are realized in the surface forms. In addition, we unify markers which are not traditionally thought of as tense. For example, we reduce constructions such as going to + verb to indicate future tense (e.g., in “I am going to dance”)."

      "text" : "Beyond verbal predicates, we deal with three common types of predications which do not adhere to the simple verbal-oriented representation in dependency trees. We re-arrange the tree structure such that each predicate heads its arguments and modifiers.3\nAdjectival predication While syntactic analyses treat adjectives as modifiers, we explicitly represent also their propositional meaning (for example sentences such as “the boy is tall” and “the tall boy” evoke the proposition tall(boy)). Adjectival propositions are connected using the “prop of” relation, denoting the 1-ary predication. We also retain the modification status of an adjective using the “mod” rela-\n3The rather complex case of nominal predication is left to be integrated in future work.\ntion, which we will elaborate on in Section 3.3. This results in the following structures:\n(1) She said that the boy is tall (2) She saw a tall boy\nShe say boy tall\nprop ofsubj comp\nShe see boy tall\nprop of\nmodsubj dobj\nNotice that in (2) we mark “tall” as a modifier of “boy” for the completeness of the see(she,tall boy) proposition, but “tall” is also used as a predicate in a separate tall(boy) proposition. Non-lexical propositions Some propositions do not correspond to a specific word in the sentence, but are rather implied from the syntactic structure. We introduce handling for two such recurring examples: appositions and existentials.\nAn appositive construction, like “Barack Obama, the U.S. president, lives in Washington”, implies that “Barack Obama is the U.S. president”, without a word mediating this relation in the sentence. We deal with such cases by introducing a synthetic SAMEAS node for apposition (and copular) constructions. Similarly, we introduce an EXISTS node for existentials (example 4).\n(3) Barack Obama, the U.S. president, lives in Washington\nlive Present\nBarack Obama SAMEAS U.S president\nlive Present\nWashington\nprep-in\nprep-in\nsubjSameAs arg\nSameAs arg mod\nsubj\n(4) She says that there are signs for rain\nShe say EXISTS signs rain\nsubj comp subj prep-for\nConditionals Conditionals are a syntactic construction in which a word (syntactically referred as “marker”) introduces a logical relation between two discrete propositions, where one of the clauses conditions the other. While there has been extensive linguistic study of the subject (Stalnaker, 1981; Bennett, 2003), NLP applications tend to overlook these constructions (a recent exception is (Berant et al., 2014)).\nWe treat conditional constructions as propositions, as they can be assigned a truth value. We consider the marker word (e.g, “because”, “although”,\n“unless”, etc.) as a predicate, taking as argument both clauses, using the “condition” and “outcome” labels, as it introduces the logical relation between them (example 5).\n(5) (a) If you build it, they will come (b) They will come, if you build it\nif you build Present it they come Future\noutcome\ncondition\nsubj dobj\nsubj"

For instance, in the sentence: “you look impatient”. Dependency representation marks the verb (look) as the head of the sentence, and the adjective (impatient) as depending on it.\nInstead, in PROPS we mark the adjective as the predicate, and the verb as a modifier. We introduce a “source” edge indicating this modification relation. This analysis focuses the attention on the main predicate and maintains a uniform predication structure, as demonstrated by the structural resemblance to “You are impatient” (example 8).4\nAdjectival complements are similar to raisingto-subject constructions (“you seem to be impatient”). Indeed, we make an attempt to represent both cases in a similar manner, having impatient as the main predicate and seem as “source”. Unfortunately, distinguishing raising from control constructions is more nuanced, and is not handled by current syntactic parers. We handle this heuristically in PROPS, as described in Section 4.1. Copulas and appositions We would like to canonicalize the semantically similar cases of copulas and appositions. Syntactic copular (“X is Y”) and appositive (“X, Y”) constructions may both evoke either an equivalence relation (“Obama, the president”; “Obama is the president”) or class - subclass / membership relation (“Obama, an american citizen”).\nThe different cases are distinguished based on the syntactic categories and definiteness status of both X and Y, regardless of whether an apposition or a copula appeared in the surface form.\n4While one may think of modality, and hence “source”, as being a feature of a predicate rather than a relation, the relation is needed for cases where the modality itself has a rich internal structure, as seen in example (8).\nWe represent the equivalence case using the SAMEAS predication node (example (3) above) and the membership case as an adjectival predication (as in example (7)).5"

      "text" : "While syntactic dependency representations contain much of the proposition structure, they do not clearly mark the boundaries of different propositions and their arguments, making it hard to focus on individual propositions. We use restrictive versus nonrestrictive modification to properly bound the scope of arguments (Kamp and Reyle, 1993).\nConsider, for instance, the following sentences: -“The director who edited ‘Rear Window’ released Psycho” -“Hitchcock, who edited ‘Rear Window’, released Psycho”. While syntactic analysis will assign similar structure for both instances, each induces different proposition boundaries. In the first sentence, the director who edited Rear-Window specifies the minimal scope of a single argument, yielding the proposition released(the director who edited Rear Window, Psycho). However, in the second sentence we can separate the relative clause from the entity it modifies, yielding two distinct propositions: edited(Hitchcock, Rear Window) and released(Hitchcock, Psycho).\nThe difference between the two cases is that the first exhibits a restrictive while the second exhibits a non-restrictive modification. Restrictive modifiers are used to select an item from a set and are an integral part of the proposition. We represent these with a “mod” edge (example 9). Non-restrictive modification, on the other hand, “breaks” the propositions and provides additional information on a selected entity, therefore forming a separate predication (example 10).\nSimilar to the differentiation we make in copulas and appositions, we identify restrictive modification by definiteness status of the entity being modified.\n(9) the director who edited ‘Rear Window’ released Psycho\nRear Window edit Past director release Past Psycho\nsubj\nmod\nobj subj obj\n5The “prop of” relation is used for both adjectival complements (“John is beautiful”) as well as noun complements (“John is a citizen”).\n(10) Hitchcock, who edited ‘Rear Window’, released Psycho\nRear Window edit Past Hitchcock release Past Psycho\nsubjobj subj obj"

However, current syntactic parsers and annotations standards do not make this distinction.\nIn order to identify raising-to-subject constructions in PROPS, we heuristically use a set of approximately 30 verbs which were found by (Chrupała and van Genabith, 2007) to frequently occur in raising constructions (including verbs such as “seems”, “looks”, “remains”, etc.).

Similarly, for “Dell sells laptops and servers” we get sell(Dell, laptos), sell(Dell, servers) and sell(Dell, laptops and servers).\nOur representation of coordination follows the Prague-Treebank style (Popel et al., 2013; Böhmová et al., 2003) and posits the coordinating word as the main node of the coordinating-conjunction structure, while the different conjuncts are attached to it using “conj” edges.\n(14) Kim and Pat speak Spanish / Kim and Pat are a couple\nKim and Pat speak Spanish\nconj-and conj-and\nsubj subj\nsubj\ndobj dobj\ndobj\nKim and Pat couple\nprop of\nconj-and conj-and\nThe semantic of coordination nodes is that the node represents the entire conjunction. Following relation propagation, relations may involve the coordination node (i.e. the entire coordinated structure) and/or the individual conjuncts.\nA similar approach is taken by the “propagated” variant of Stanford Dependencies (de Marneffe and\nManning, 2008a), but we differ in choosing the coordination as the main element in the conjunction, and take more care in distinguishing different kinds of coordination constructions and determining the conjunction scope. As one example, we distinguish between distributive and joint coordination (Huddleston et al., 2002). In distributive coordination (“Kim and Pat speak Spanish”) we fully propagate the relations, while for cases of joint coordination (“Kim and Pat are a couple”)6 we do not propagate, as the relation is meant only for the combination of both entities. When the relation propagation results in multiple propositions involving the same predicate, the predicate node is duplicated in order to distinguish the different propositions and keep with the 1-1 correspondence between propositions and predicate nodes.\nWe also propagate relations in appositive and copular constructions involving the SAMEAS node (example 3), e.g. “Amazon, the retail giant, sells products” will evoke both sell(Amazon, products) and sell(retail giant, products)."

While hierarchical structure generally implies dependence of the nested proposition, in certain constructions the nested proposition is in fact independent of its subordinating clause.

They convert a question and a possible answer into a candidate answer (CA)\n(e.g., “Billy is the name of the boy” is obtained from the question/answer pair “what is the name of the boy?”/“Billy”), counts lexical matches between CA and a sliding window over the story, and returns the answer with the maximal number of matches.\nOur adaptation works by counting matches of representation-units instead of words: The CA is compared against each story sentence (instead of a sliding window), and instead of counting lexical matches counts the number of identical representation-units in the CA and the sentence.11 Table 3 shows the adaptation is effective: using dependencies improve over the lexical baseline reported in the MCTest paper, and using PROPS further improves results over dependency trees.\nPROPS outperforms dependencies in answering questions involving phenomena addressed by our framework (e.g., in appositives: “John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches.” to answer: “What did John and Rick both love?”, or adjectival complements as in “she was wearing a costume that looked like a kitten” to answer the question “What did Tessa’s costume look like?”)."

      "text" : "Abstracting away from syntax and providing a more semantically-oriented sentence representations has been the focus of several research efforts. In terms of the produced outputs, perhaps the most similar to ours is UCCA (Abend and Rappoport, 2013). They proposed a new representation scheme geared towards semantic applications and a small accompanying gold standard corpus. However, UCCA differs in their main motivations. Namely they aim to be a cognitive interlingua representation. The design choices of UCCA seem to focus on descriptiveness and universality rather than immediate use, resulting in a cognitively-motivated label-set that, for\n11Both PROPS and Stanford-dependency trees were obtained by using Berkeley Parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007) as the base parser. In both cases the representation-units are (sourceword(s), label, target-word(s)) triplets.\nexample, does not distinguish between subjects and objects giving both a “participant” status. Finally, to the best of our knowledge there is no automated system capable of inferring UCCA structures from text, while we provide a concrete implementation and demonstrate its effectiveness.\nSemantic Role Labeling (SRL) (Carreras and Màrquez, 2005b) is also centered around proposition structures, with the goal of identifying predicates and linking each predicate to its semantic arguments (agent, patient, etc.) and adjuncts (locative, temporal, etc.). While SRL does not cover the full scope of propositions and unifications handled by PROPS, for the propositions it does cover it tackles a challenging semantic task that PROPS does not attempt to address, namely assigning arguments with semantic roles and grounding predicates to a semantic lexicon. PROPS graphs may be extended with SRL annotations, which can be incorporated on top of PROPS structures by adding semantic-role labels to predicate-argument relations.\nOther notable semantic representations include GMB (Basile et al., 2012), UNL (Uchida and Zhu, 2001) and recently AMR (Banarescu et al., 2013). While AMR’s rooted tree cannot capture independent propositions within a single sentence, it otherwise subsumes PROPS and SRL, aiming to provide the complete semantic structure of the sentence (along with inner structure and inter-relations). Producing accurate AMR structures requires in-depth semantic analysis, and it is currently produced with relatively low accuracy (Flanigan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Pust et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015). In contrast, PROPS is designed to be relatively easy to induce. Generally, PROPS can be viewed as a step between syntax and more semantic representations, providing a strong foundation on top of which more elaborate semantic annotations can be added."

PROPS allows semantic applications to easily explore a broad range of the proposition structure, oblivious to the way it was expressed in the surface syntactic form. In addition, we produced an automatic high accuracy conversion of the WSJ, and showed the out-of-the-box applicability of the PROPS converter."

Yet, while much semantic structure is indeed expressed by syntax, many phenomena are not easily read out of dependency trees, often leading to further ad-hoc heuristic postprocessing or to information loss. To directly address the needs of semantic applications, we present PROPS – an output representation designed to explicitly and uniformly express much of the proposition structure which is implied from syntax, and an associated tool for extracting it from dependency trees.",
