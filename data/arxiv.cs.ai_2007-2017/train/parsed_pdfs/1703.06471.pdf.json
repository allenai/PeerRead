      "text" : "Decision making involves choosing among different actions over a multiple range of time scales. The use of higher level temporally extended actions allow an AI agent to solve an entire task in smaller number of decision epochs. Like many other AI systems, Temporal abstraction is often used in reinforcement learning to solve large problems efficiently. Various methods have been proposed to reduce computational burden, and reducing data complexity in learning, by allowing planning in AI systems to compute a good policy for many situations at once. In environments with continuously valued observations or others with a large number of states, some form of generalization is necessary. Linear methods are perhaps the most common and best understood class of generalization mechanisms. Linear methods encompass a wide spectrum of approaches including look-up tables, state aggregation methods, radial basis functions with fixed bases, etc. Frameworks for temporal abstractions do not usually contain an intrinsic structure to describe such generalizations. To achieve generalizations usually temporal abstractions are defined over parametric representation of the environment states, among which linear representations are the most dominant approach.\nSince temporal effects are linked to the agents decision method, temporal abstraction framework is tightly coupled with controls. Markov Decision Process (MDP) models provide a formal method of planning in controlled dynamical systems (Sutton and Barto (1998)). The MDP models for planning which are based on primitive actions can be easily extended to SMDP (Semi Markov Decision Process) planning models which include temporally extended actions. The SMDP theory with models based on options framework, provides a formal method for representing temporally abstract information. An option O is a tuple {I, µ, β}, where I is the initiation set of the option, µ is the behavior policy of the option O , β is the termination condition which defines the time scale of the option. The option models (µ and β) are either constructed by learning maximum-likelihood primitive models and computing exactly option models by composing primitive models or learning option models using intraoption learning, importance sampling, or eligibility traces.\nAlthough the option models have been proved to be quite successful in continuous state spaces (one of the central advantages of temporal abstraction), the ability to plan using temporal abstraction methods is still a challenge when the number of states is large. This is in large partly because learning option models for large state spaces is very expensive. Moreover, if the system needs to act in real time, there is not much time for deliberation. In such cases the system needs to make use of many option models over multiple time scales. We propose here that instead of learning option models from the data, the system should rather make use of many option models over multiple time scales even if they are a lot in number. We use the linear option models (Sorg and Singh (2010)) for learning and planning. Learning a policy over many option models does not effect the time complexity because the linear methods scale linearly with the complexity of the value function. Linear option model extends\nthe option framework from a tabular representation to a linear representation. These models provide a general mechanism for providing temporal abstraction over parametric representation of the state space. Behavior of such a model is proved to be sensible while learning and planning. Although linear options provide great benefits towards time efficiency, the SMDP-LSTD algorithm used for policy evaluation using linear options has a quadratic complexity. This makes their convergence slow as compared to the conventional linear complexity of the TD algorithms.\nRecently various temporal difference algorithms were proposed which are compatible with both linear function approximation and off-policy training using primitive action in MDP setting (GTD algorithm Sutton et al. (2001), GTD2 and TDC algorithms Sutton et al. (2009)). These algorithms were shown to converge to the TD fixed point with probability one. We propose a direct extension of the TDC algorithm to the SMDP setup. We show the convergence conditions for the SMDP-TDC algorithm using results from stochastic approximation theory."

Every MDP time step t, the agent takes an action at in state st, and the environment responds with a reward rt and resulting next state s′t = st+1. A policy π : S× 7→ [0, 1] is a mapping from states to actions. An action-value function, Q(s, a) is the expected discounted return obtained by taking action a in state s and following π thereafter. The Bellman equation defining the optimal action value function Q∗ is:\nQ∗(s, a) = R(s, a) + γ ∑ s′∈S P ss ′ a max b∈A Q∗(s′, a)\nA policy that is greedy with respect to a given action value function maps each state to arg maxaQ(s, a).

      "text" : "Off Policy methods are an important classes of algorithms studied in Reinforcement Learning. Any controlled dynamical system is said to be off policy, if the behavior policy (the one which is being followed) is different from the policy being evaluated. Among various methods of learning in RL, temporal difference methods are undoubtedly the most important and novel ones. Temporal Difference methods have the advantage that they can learn directly from the raw data\nwithout any requirement of the environment’s model as well as they can bootstrap by updating estimates based in part on other learned estimates. Among the temporal difference (TD) methods, off policy TD control algorithm known as Q-learning is the most central one. Its simplest form, one-step Q-learning, is defined by\nQ(st, at) = Q(st, at) + α [ rt+1 + γmax\na Q(st+1, a)−Q(st, at) ]"

      "text" : "In reinforcement learning, linear methods have long been used for value function approximation. Instead of using tabular representation of states, states are represented in terms of n dimensional feature vectors φ(s) ∈ IRn. Linear methods approximate the value function for a policy π as linear combination of state feature vectors. V π(s) ≈ φ(s)T θπ, where θπ is the vector parameter to be learned, θ ∈ IRn.\nUnfortunately Q-learning does not show a good behavior when used with function approximations that are linear in the learned parameters. As a result convergence cannot be guaranteed for such methods (Baird (1995)). Several non-gradient-descent approaches to this problem have been developed, but none has been completely satisfactory . Second-order methods, such as LSTD (Bradtke et al. (1996), Boyan (2002)), can be guaranteed stable under general conditions, but their computational complexity is quadratic in the size of the state space. In recent years several gradient descent methods have been proposed (GTD, GTD2, and TDC algorithms ). These methods are shown to have a linear computation complexity and linear memory requirements. Among these methods TDC shows the fastest rate of convergence. The update estimates for TDC are:\nθk+1 = θk + αk(δkφk − γφ′k)(φTkwk) (1)\nwhere αk and βk are the learning rate parameters, and wk is updated as,\nwk+1 = wk + βk(δk − φTkwk)φk (2)\nand δk is the TD error\nδk = rk + γθ T k φ ′ k − θTk φk (3)\nIt is proved that TDC algorithm converges to the TD fixed point with probability one."

They can be thought of as fixed policies that can be invoked in certain set of states and which terminate according to a termination condition. Formally an option is a triple (I, µ, β), where the\nset I ⊂ S is the initiation set of the option, µ : S 7→ A is the option policy and β : S 7→ [0, 1] maps each state to the set [0, 1] which is the probability of termination in each state s ∈ S. MDP along with the options describe a Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP). SMDP is like a MDP, except the options take varying amounts of time. In each SMDP time step, the agent selects an option and follows the option’s policy µ until termination. In any state, one has to choose an option from the set of options available in that state. When the system enters a new subset of the state space, a new set of options becomes available.\nThe Bellman equation for SMDP setup is a direct extension of the Bellman equation for the MDP case\nQ∗O(s, o) = r o s + ∑ s′ P ss ′ o max o′∈O′s Q∗O(s ′, o′)\nwhere ros is the expected discounted reward obtained during the execution of the option\nros = E [ rt + · · ·+ γk−1rt+k−1|st = s, ot = o ] and P ss ′\no is the option’s transition model Similarly the SMDP version of one step Q learning using options can be\nwritten as follows\nQ(s, o) = Q(s, o) + α [ r + γk max\no′∈Os′ Q(s′, o′)−Q(s, o) ] where k is the number of time steps elapsed between s and s′, r denotes the\ncumulative discounted reward until the termination of the option."

      "text" : "tions\nThe LSTD algorithms developed can be guaranteed stable under general conditions but they are quadratic in computational complexity. We propose here a gradient descent method (SMDP-TDC ) for planning in Reinforcement learning using off-policy TD framework. SMDP-TDC is the direct extension of TDC algorithm (Equations 1, 2 and 3) to the SMDP setting. The option value function is approximated as V π(s) = maxoQ\nπ(s, o) ≈ θTφs. We aim to minimize the mean-square projected bellman error (MSPBEθ = ‖Vθ −ΠTVθ‖2D. For the linear option architecture Vθ = Φθ where Φ is the matrix whose rows are φs.

      "heading" : "3.1 Convergence Proof for SMDP-TDC",
      "text" : "Theorem 1 Consider the iterations 9 and 10 of the SMDP-TDC algorithm. Let the step-size sequences αk and βk, k ≥ 0 satisfy in this case αk, βk > 0, for all k,∑∞ k=0 αk = ∑∞ k=0 βk =∞, ∑∞ k=0 α 2 k, ∑∞ k=0 β 2 k <∞ and that αk βk → 0 as k →∞. Further assume that (φk, rk, φ ′ k) is an i.i.d sequence with uniformly bounded second moments. Let A = E[φk(φk − γlφ′k)T ], b = E[rkφk], and C = E[φkφTk ]. Assume that A and C are non singular. Then the parameter vector θk converges with probability one to the TD fixed point.\nProof The proof of this theorem is based on a two time scale difference in the step-size schedule {αk} and {βk}; refer Borkar (1997) for a convergence analysis of the general two timescale stochastic approximation recursions. The recursions 9 and 10 correspond to the faster and slower recursions respectively. This is because beyond some integer N0 > 0 ∀ k, the increments in 9 are uniformly larger than those in 10 and hence converge faster. Along faster timescale, i.e, the one corresponding to {βk}, the associated system ODEs corresponds to\nθ̇(t) = 0 (12)\nẇ(t) = E[δtφt|θ(t)]− Cw(t) (13)\nThe ODE 12 suggests that θ(t) = θ from the faster timescale perspective. Indeed, recursion 9 can be rewritten as θk+1 = θk + βkξ(k), where from 9, ξ(k) = ( αk βk (δkφk − γlφ′kφTkwk) ) → 0 almost surely as k → ∞ because αkβk → 0 as k → ∞. By the Hirsch lemma (Hirsch (1989)), it follow that ‖θk − θ‖ → 0 almost surely as k →∞ for the same θ that depends on the initial condition θ0 of recursion 9.\nConsider now the recursion 10. Let Mk+1 = (δkφk − φkφTkwk)− E[(δkφk − φkφ T kwk)|F(k)], where F(k) = σ(wm, θm,m ≤ k;φs, φ′s, rs, s < k), k ≥ 1 are the sigma fields generated by w0, θ0, wm+1, θm+1, φm, φ ′ m, 0 ≤ m < k. It is easy to verify that Mk+1, k ≥ 0 are integrable random variables that satisfy E[Mk+1|F(k)] = 0, ∀k ≥ 0. Also because rk, φk and φ′k have uniformly bounded second moments, it can be seen that\nE [ ‖Mk+1‖2 |F(k) ] ≤ c1 ( 1 + ‖|wk||2 + ||θk||2 ) ,\nfor all k ≥ 0, for some constant c1 > 0 Now consider the ODE pair 12 and 13. Because θ(t) = θ from 12, the ODE 13 can written as\nẇ(t) = E[δtφt|θ]− Cw(t) (14)\nNow consider the function h(w) = E[δφ|θ] − Cw, i.e. the driving vector field of the ODE 14. For 14, w∗ = C−1E[δφ|θ] is the unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Let h∞(.) be the funciton defined by h∞(w) = limr→∞ h(rw) r . Then h∞(w) = −Cw. For the ODE ẇ(t) = h∞(w(t)) = −Cw(t) the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium because C is a positive definite matrix. The assumptions are now verified and by Borkar and Meyn (2000) Theorem 2.2 we obtain ||wk − w∗|| → 0 almost surely as k →∞.\nConsider now the slower time scale recursion 9. Using above, 10 can be rewritten as\nθk+1 = θk + αk(δkφk − γlφ′kφTkC−1E[δkφk|θk]) (15)\nLet G(k) = σ(θm,m ≤ k;φs, φ′s, rs, s < k) be the sigma fields generated by the quantities θ0, θm+1, φm, φ ′ m, 0 ≤ m < k. Let\nZk+1 = (δkφk − γlφ′kφkC−1E[δkφk|θk]) − E[(δkφk − γlφ′kφTkC−1E[δkφk θk])|G(k)] = (δkφk − γlφ′kφTkC−1E[δkφk|θk]) − E[δkφk|θk]− γlE[φ′kφTk ]C−1E[δkφk|θk]\nIt is easy to see that Zk, k ≥ 0 are integrable random variables and E [Zk+1|G(k)] = 0,∀k ≥ 0. Further,\nE [ ‖Zk+1‖2 |G(k) ] ≤ c2 ( 1 + ‖θk‖2 ) , k ≥ 0\nfor some constant c2 > 0 again because rk, φk and φ ′ k have uniformly bounded second moments. Consider now the following ODE associated with 9\nθ̇(t) = ( I − E [ γlφ′φt ] C−1 ) E[δφ|θ(t)] (16)\nLet h̄(θ(t)) be the driving vector field of the ODE 16. Note that h̄(θ(t)) = ( I − E [ γlφ′φT ] C−1 ) E [δφ|θ(t)]\n= ( C − E [ γlφ′φT ]) C−1E [δφ|θ(t)]\n= ( E [ φφT ] − E [ γlφ′φT ]) C−1E [δφ|θ(t)]\n= ATC−1(−Aθ(t) + b)\nbecause E[δφ|θ(t)] = −Aθ(t) + b. Now θ∗ = A−1b can be seen to be the unique globally asymptotically stable\nequilibrium for 16. Let h̄∞(θ) = limr→∞ h̄(rθ) r . Then h̄∞(θ) = −A TC−1Aθ. Consider now the ODE\nθ̇(t) = −ATC−1Aθ(t) (17)\nBecause C−1 is positive definite and A has full rank (as it is nonsingular by assumption), the matrix ATC−1A is also positive definite. The ODE 17 has the origin as its unique globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. The assumptions are once again verified and the claim follows."

      "text" : "Autonomous systems make decisions by choosing actions at multiple time scales. Although planning for acting at multiple time scales requires more computational time. Real time systems do not have much time for deliberation. Hence a lot of research has been done to construct just the right number of options by optimizing the computational time around models to accommodate multiple time scales (Stolle and Precup (2002), Wolfe and Barto (2005)). Is it necessary\nto be so careful, or can we do around with many option models? The ideas central to planning is searching and learning while searching. We demonstrate empirically that it is much better to search with many option models, rather than using few handcrafted ones.\nWe use the sample based search to search through the state space. The search is done by picking up a quasi-random model and sampling the next state, up to a given depth. At the given depth a guess of the value function is used to greedily pick up the best move. Typically a large number of rollouts is performed, and values lower in the search tree are used to update the values higher up in the search tree (Kocsis and Szepesvri (2006), Veness et al. (2010)). Number of rollouts is a parameter that controls the time for deliberation. The experiment was performed on the gridworld domain shown in Figure 1. We use the hallway going options where the option models are precoded. Values for all options are learned over 50 trials, using off-policy random behavior. The following six experimental conditions were used to describe what to do on the next time step a) Execute the greedy policy using only primitives b) Pick the primitive action suggested by the greedy option policy with the hand-crafted options c) Pick the primitive action suggested by the greedy policy with random options d) Do 100 rollouts of depth 3 using only primitive actions e) Do 100 rollouts of depth 3 using primitive actions and crafted options f) Do 100 rollouts of depth 3, sampling among 6 options from the random set\nAs wee see in Figure 2 search using many option models is better than just using a few handcrafted ones. The results also demonstrate the usefulness of\ntemporal abstraction and search. Search, and learning using many option model does not effect the time, as the computational complexity of the linear option framework does not depend upon the number of options being used. There are different ways to incorporate search in a real-time system a) The planning can be separately threaded b) Trying to anticipate what may happen using the model and planning for different states before the sensation is received ."

We demonstrate two experimental conditions where option models are composed over multiple time scales and various random policies. The first experiment consists of two time scales - β = 0.5, 1 and biased random policies defined as follows - Pick a probability x ∈ (0, 1), pick uniformly an action a, the system will pick the action a with probability x and all other actions uniformly with probability 1− x.

In addition it can also detect the color of the floor beneath it. It has 3 available primitive actions:forward which moves the robot one unit in the forward direction with respect to its current position and orientation, left turns the robot towards left by an angle of 30o at its current location, and right which turns the robot towards right with an angle of 30o at its current location. If the robot hits the wall, its motion is halted in the direction perpendicular to the wall plane. The agent is given a reward of 1 for reaching the purple room on the right side of the domain. After receiving its reward, the agent is transported to the yellow room on the left corner of the building. At all other times, the agent receives a small negative reward of 0.01.\nThe agent represent states using feature vectors φ of 1204 features. The first four features encode the color of the floor in a binary format.

To make the feature vector sparse, which can help computationally, any feature that would have had a value φi < 0.1, is set to 0.\nWe tested 2 agents with the above setting, the first agent uses the MDPTDC learning, while the second agent uses the SMDP-TDC learning using 200 randomly generated option models, with 5 different time scales.

    "abstractText" : "Deliberating on large or continuous state spaces have been long standing challenges in reinforcement learning. Temporal Abstraction have somewhat made this possible, but efficiently planing using temporal abstraction still remains an issue. Moreover using spatial abstractions to learn policies for various situations at once while using temporal abstraction models is an open problem. We propose here an efficient algorithm which is convergent under linear function approximation while planning using temporally abstract actions. We show how this algorithm can be used along with randomly generated option models over multiple time scales to plan agents which need to act real time. Using these randomly generated option models over multiple time scales are shown to reduce number of decision epochs required to solve the given task, hence effectively reducing the time needed for deliberation. ar X iv :1 70 3. 06 47 1v 1 [ cs .A I] 1 9 M ar 2 01 7",
