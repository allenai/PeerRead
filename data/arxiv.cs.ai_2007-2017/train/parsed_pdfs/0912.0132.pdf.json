      "text" : "Case-based reasoning (CBR [6]) is a reasoning paradigm based on the reuse of previous problem-solving experiences, called cases. A CBR system often has profit of a retrieval procedure, selecting in a case base a source case similar to the target problem, and an adaptation procedure, that adapts the retrieved source case to the specificity of the target problem. The adaptation procedure depends on domain-dependent adaptation knowledge (AK, in the following). Acquiring AK can be done from experts or by using machine learning techniques. An intermediate approach is knowledge discovery (KD) that combines efficient learning algorithms with human-machine interaction.\nMost of previousAK acquisition strategies are off-line: they are disconnected from the use of the CBR system. By contrast, recent work aims at integrating AK acquisition from experts to specific reasoning sessions: this opportunistic AK acquisition takes advantage of the problem-solving context. This paper presents an approach to AK discovery that is opportunistic: the KD is triggered at problem-solving time.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some basic notions and notations about CBR. Section 3 presents the CBR system Taaable, which constitutes the application context of the study, and motivates the need for adaptation knowledge acquisition in this application context. Section 4 presents the proposed opportunistic and interactive AK discovery method. In Sect. 5, this method is applied to acquire adaptation knowledge in the context of the Taaable system. Section 6 discusses this approach and situates it among related work. Section 7 concludes and presents some future work."

      "text" : "In the following, problems are assumed to be represented in a language Lpb and solutions in a language Lsol. A source case represents a problem-solving episode by a pair (srce, Sol(srce)), in which srce ∈ Lpb is the representation of a problem statement and Sol(srce) ∈ Lsol is the representation of its associated solution. CBR aims at solving a target problem tgt using a set of source cases CB called the case base. The CBR process is usually decomposed in two main steps: retrieval and adaptation. Retrieval selects a source case (srce, Sol(srce)) from the case base such that srce is judged to be similar to tgt according to a given similarity criterion. Adaptation consists in modifying Sol(srce) in order\nto propose a candidate solution S̃ol(tgt) for tgt to the user. If the user validates\nthe candidate solution S̃ol(tgt), then S̃ol(tgt) is considered to be a solution Sol(tgt) for tgt.\n3 Application Context: the Taaable System\nThe Taaable system [3] is a cooking CBR system. In the cooking domain, CBR aims at answering a query using a set of recipes. In order to answer a query, the system retrieves a recipe in the recipe set and adapts it to produce a recipe satisfying the query. The Taaable system was proposed to participate to the Computer Cooking Contest (CCC) challenge in 2008 [4]. In the CCC challenge, queries are given in natural language and express a set of constraints that the desired recipe should satisfy. These constraints concern the ingredients to be included or avoided, the type of ingredients (e.g., meat or fruit), the dietary practice (e.g., nut-free diet), the type of meal (e.g., soup) or the type of cuisine (e.g., chinese cuisine). An example of query is: “Cook a chinese soup with leek but no peanut oil.” Recipes are given in textual form, with a shallow XML structure, and include a set of ingredients togetherwith a textual part describing the recipe preparation. The Taaable system is accessible online (http://taaable.fr)."

      "heading" : "3.1 Representation Issues",
      "text" : "ACooking Ontology. The systemmakes use of a cooking ontology O represented in propositional logic. Each concept ofO corresponds to a propositional variable taken fromafinite setV of propositional variables.O ismainly composedof a set of concepts organized in a hierarchy, which corresponds, in propositional logic, to a set of logical implications a ⇒ b. For example, the axiom leek ⇒ onions of O states that leeks are onions.\nProblem and Solution Representation. In Taaable, a problem pb ∈ Lpb represents a query and a solution Sol(pb) of pb represents a recipe that matches this query. Lpb and Lsol are chosen fragments of propositional logic defined using the vocabularyV introduced in the cooking ontology O. One propositional variable is\ndefined inLpb andLsol for each concept name ofO and the only logical connective used in Lpb and Lsol is the conjunction ∧. For example, the representation tgt ∈ Lpb of the query mentioned above is:\ntgt = chinese∧ soup ∧ leek ∧ ¬ peanut oil\nThe case base CB contains a set of recipes. Each recipe is indexed in the case base by a propositional formula R ∈ Lsol. For example, the index R of the recipe Wonton Soup is:\nR = chinese∧ soup ∧ green onion ∧ . . . ∧ peanut oil ∧Nothing else\nNothing else denotes a conjunction of negative literals ¬ a for all a ∈ V such that chinese ∧ soup ∧ green onion ∧ . . . ∧ peanut oil 2O a. This kind of “closed world assumption” states explicitly that for all propositional variable a ∈ V, either R O a (the recipe contains the ingredient represented by a) or R O ¬ a (the recipe does not contain the ingredient represented by a).\nEach recipe index R represents a set of source cases: R represents the set of source cases (srce, Sol(srce)) such that Sol(srce) = R and srce is solved by R, i.e., srce is such that R O srce.\nAdaptation Knowledge. In Taaable, adaptation knowledge is given by a set of reformulations (r,Ar) inwhichr is a binary relationbetweenproblemsandAr is an adaptation function associatedwith r [13]. A reformulation has the following semantics: if two problems pb1 and pb2 are relatedby r—denoted by pb1 r pb2— then for every recipe Sol(pb1) matching the query pb1, Ar(pb1, Sol(pb1), pb2) = S̃ol(pb2) matches the query pb2. In this paper, binary relations r are given by substitutions of the form σ = α β, where α and β are literals (either positive or negative). For example, the substitution σ = leek onions generalizes leek into onions.\nAdaptation functions Ar are given by substitutions of the form Σ = A B in which A and B are conjunctions of literals. For example, the substitution Σ = soup ∧ pepper soup ∧ ginger states that pepper can be replaced by ginger in soup recipes. A substitution Σ can be automatically generated from a substitution σ: Σ = b a if σ is of the form a b and Σ = ∅ ¬ a if σ is of the form ¬ a ∅.\nThe main source of adaptation knowledge is the ontology O. A substitution σ = a b is automatically generated from each axiom a ⇒ b of O and correspond to a substitution by generalization. A substitution σ = a b can be applied to a query pb if pb O a. σ generates a new query σ(pb) inwhich the propositional variable a has been substituted by the propositional variable b. For example, the substitution σ = leek onions is generated automatically from the axiom leek ⇒ onions of O. σ can be applied to the query tgt to produce the query σ(tgt) = chinese ∧ soup ∧ onions ∧ ¬ peanut oil, in which leek has been substituted by onions. For each propositional variable a of V, an additional substitution of the form σ = ¬ a ∅ is generated. Such a substitution can be applied to a problem pb if pb O ¬ a and generates a newproblem σ(pb) inwhich\nthe negative literal ¬ a is removed. This has the effect to loosen the constraints imposed on a query e.g., by omitting in the query an unwanted ingredient. For example, the substitution ¬ peanut oil ∅ applied to tgt generates the query σ(tgt) = chinese∧soup∧leek, in which the condition on the ingredient peanut oil is omitted.\nHowever, when O is the only source of adaptation knowledge, the system is only able to perform simple adaptations, in which the modifications made to Sol(srce) correspond to a sequence of substitutions that can be used to transform srce into tgt. Therefore, an additional adaptation knowledge base AKB is introduced. AKB contains a set of reformulations (σ, Σ) that capture more complex adaptation strategies.\n3.2 The CBR Process in Taaable\nRetrieval. The retrieval algorithm is based on a smooth classification algorithm on an index hierarchy. Such an algorithm aims at determining a set ofmodifications to apply to tgt in order to obtain a modified query srce that matches at least one recipe Sol(srce) of the case base. The algorithm computes a similarity path, which is a composition of substitutions SP = σq ◦ σq−1 ◦ · · · ◦ σ1 such that there exists at least one recipe Sol(srce) matching the modified query srce = σq(σq−1(. . . σ1(tgt) . . .)), i.e., such that Sol(srce) O srceholds. Thus, a similarity path SP can be written:\nSol(srce) O srce σq ←− σq−1 ←−− · · · σ1 ←− tgt\nFor example, to solve the above query tgt, the system generates a similarity path SP = σ2 ◦ σ1, with:\ntgt = chinese∧ soup ∧ leek ∧ ¬ peanut oil\nσ1 = ¬ peanut oil ∅, σ2 = leek onions\nsrce = chinese∧ soup ∧ onions\nSol(srce) = chinese∧ soup ∧ green onion∧ . . . ∧ peanut oil ∧Nothing else\nIn this similarity path, Sol(srce) is the propositional representation of the recipe Wonton Soup. Since the ontology O contains the axiom green onion⇒ onions, the modified query srce = σ2 ◦ σ1 (tgt) verifies Sol(srce) O srce.\nAdaptation. To a similarity path is associated an adaptation path AP, which is a composition of substitutions AP = Σ1 ◦ Σ2 ◦ · · · ◦ Σq such that the modified\nrecipe S̃ol(tgt) = Σ1(Σ2(. . . Σq(Sol(srce)) . . .)) solves the initial query tgt, i.e.,\nverifies S̃ol(tgt) O tgt. Thus, an adaptation path AP can be written\nSol(srce) Σq −→ Σq−1 −−→ · · · Σ1 −→ S̃ol(tgt) O tgt\nThe adaptation path AP is constructed from the similarity path SP by associating a substitution Σi to each substitution σi. To determine which substitution\nΣi to associate to a given substitution σi, the external adaptation knowledge base AKB is searched first. For a substitution σi = α β, the system looks for a substitution Σ = A B such that A O β and B O α. For example, if σ2 = leek onions is used in SP and AKB contains the reformulation (σ, Σ) with σ = σ2 and Σ = green onion leek ∧ ginger, Σ will be selected to constitute the substitution Σ2 in AP since green onion O onions and leek ∧ ginger O leek. If no substitution Σ is found in AKB for a given substitution σi then Σi is generated automatically from σi.\nIn the previous example, AKB is considered to be empty soΣ1 andΣ2 are generated automatically from the substitutions σ1 and σ2: Σ1 = ∅ ¬ peanut oil since σ1 = ¬ peanut oil ∅ and Σ2 = onions leek since σ2 = leek onions. According to the axiom green onion ⇒ onions of O, the system further specializes the substitution Σ2 into the substitution green onion leek and the user is proposed to replace green onions by leek in the recipe Wonton Soup and to suppress peanut oil. The generated adaptation path is AP = Σ1 ◦ Σ2 (Fig. 1), with:\n3.3 Why Learning Adaptation Knowledge in Taaable?\nIn the version of the Taaable system that was proposed to participate in the CCC challenge, AKB = ∅ so adaptation knowledge is inferred from the ontology O. The main advantage of this approach lies in its simplicity: no external source of adaptation knowledge is needed and the system is able to propose a solution to any target problem. However, the system’s adaptation capabilities (simple\nsubstitutions) appear to be very limited and the user has no means to give some feedback on the quality of the proposed adaptation.\nFor example, the substitutionΣ1 = ∅ ¬ peanut oil suggests to remove the ingredient peanut oil in the retrieved recipe, but as the oil is used in this recipe to saute the bok choy, the adapted recipe turns out to be practically unfeasible. A better adaptation would suggest to replace peanut oil by e.g., sesame oil, which can be modeled by the substitution Σ1 = peanut oil sesame oil. To generate this substitution automatically, the system could for example exploit the fact that the concepts peanut oil and sesame oil are both sub-concepts of the concept oil in O. But still, some additional knowledge would be needed to express the fact that peanut oil should be replaced by sesame oil, and not by olive oil or hot chili oil, as olive oil and hot chili oil are also sub-concepts of oil inO. Besides, the system should be aware that this substitution is recommended only in Asian cuisine, which can be modeled by the more precise substitution Σ1 = asian∧ peanut oil asian ∧ sesame oil.\nFurthermore, the second substitution Σ2 = green onions leek suggests to solely replace sliced green onions by uncooked leek. But the green onion was used in the original Wonton Soup for garniture, so the user might consider that raw leek added as garniture alters too much the taste of a soup. A better adaptationwould consist in frying leek with e.g., tempeh and red bell pepper to prepare the garniture. Such an adaptation can be modeled by the substitution Σ2 = green onions leek ∧ tempeh ∧ red bell pepper. This substitution, which reflects a cooking know-how, can hardly be generated automatically from the ontology.\nThese examples show that in order to improve its adaptation capabilities, the system would greatly benefit from the availability of a set of adaptation rules that would capture more complex adaptation strategies. These adaptation rules cannot be generated automatically from the ontology and need to be acquired fromother knowledge sources. These examples also show that the human expert plays a major role in adaptation knowledge acquisition and that in the cooking domain, adaptation rules are often highly contextual."

Knowledge discovery techniques combine efficient machine\nlearning algorithmswith human-machine interaction. In [5], AK is learned from differences between cases by the means of knowledge discovery techniques. A set of pairs of sources cases is taken as input of a frequent itemset extraction algorithm, which outputs a set of itemsets. Each of these itemsets can be interpreted as an adaptation rule. This approach of AK learning was motivated by the original idea proposed by Kathleen Hanney and Mark T. Keane in [11], in which the authors suggest that AK may be learned from differences between cases. The main assumption is that the differences that occur between cases in the case base are often representative of differences that will occur between future problems and the case base.\nTo learn adaptation rules fromdifferences between cases, representing variations between cases is essential. In [2], expressive representation formalisms are proposed and it is shown that defining a partial order on the variation language can help organizing the learned rules by generality."

      "text" : "Experiential knowledge, or know-how, can often be acquired on-line, when users are using CBR tools. It is the aim of interactive and opportunistic knowledge acquisition strategies to support such an acquisition. In these strategies, the system exploits its interactions with its user to build new pieces of knowledge, to test them and, in case of success, to retain them. Moreover, the knowledge acquisition process is often opportunistic, i.e, triggered by a previous reasoning failure: reasoning failures highlight missing knowledge and thus constitute a guidance for the acquisition process. A major advantage of interactive knowledge acquisition strategies is that they ensure that the user is in a favorable context when he participates to the acquisition process. In [7], a review of interactive and opportunistic knowledge acquisition approaches is proposed, and two strategies are developed. This work illustrates the efficiency of interactive and opportunistic knowledge acquisition approaches to acquire specific knowledge. On the other hand, it shows that such approaches only allow the systems to acquire small pieces of knowledge at a time."

      "heading" : "4.3 Combining the two Approaches",
      "text" : "When properly used, knowledge discovery techniques may have the strong advantage of automating a part of the knowledge acquisition process. In these approaches, dedicated human-machine interfaces allow the expert, through predefined interactions, to provide feedback on a set of suggestions generated automatically by the system. The role of the expert is thus reduced to the validation of a pre-selected set of knowledge pieces. The acquired knowledge is directly usable by the system, without the need for an additional formalization step. Automatic approaches also benefit from efficient machine learning algorithms that can be applied, as in [2], to learn adaptation rules at different levels of generality. However, these approaches still produce a large number of\ncandidate knowledge units that have to be validated by a domain expert out of any context, which constitutes an important drawback.\nAcquiring adaptation knowledge offline, i.e., independently of a particular problem-solving session, appears to be problematic. Offline AK acquisition forces the system’s designer to anticipate the need for adaptation knowledge in problem-solving and to acquire it in advance, which can be very tedious, if not impossible. Offline acquisition of adaptation knowledge also makes difficult to come upwith fine-grained adaptation rules, since adaptation knowledge is often highly contextual. For example, in the cooking domain, an egg can sometimes be substituted by 100 grams of tofu, but this adaptation rule may be applied only to certain types of dishes, like cakes or mayonnaise, and has proved to be irrelevant in order to adapt a mousse recipe or an omelet recipe. Acquiring such a rule would require to circumscribe its domain of validity in order to avoid over-generalization.\nMoreover, initial acquisition of adaptation knowledge prevents the system from learning from experience. ACBR systemwith fixed adaptation knowledge has no way to improve its problem-solving capabilities, except by retaining in the case base a new experience each time a problem has been solved, as it is usually done in traditional CBR systems [6].\nOn the other hand, interactive and opportunistic knowledge acquisition approaches heavily rely on the human expert but ensure that the expert is “in context” when validating knowledge units that are to be acquired. Combining knowledge discovery techniques and interactive approaches, as it is proposed here, could overcome one of the limitations of KD by dramatically reducing the number of candidate adaptation rules presented to the expert. By triggering the process in an opportunistic manner, the expert is able to parametrize the KD in order to focus on specific knowledge to acquire in context. The resulting AK discovery process:\n– is performed on-line, i.e., in the context of a problem-solving session, – is interactive as adaptation knowledge is learned by the system through interactions with its user who acts as an expert, – is opportunistic as it is triggered by reasoning failure, and, consequently, often helps repairing a failed adaptation, – makes use of knowledge discovery techniques to provide assistance to the user in the formulation of new knowledge: the user is presented with a set of suggestions that are generated automatically from the case base.\n5 Applying Opportunistic AK Discovery to Taaable\nIn this section, an opportunistic AK discovery process is applied to the context of the Taaable system."

      "text" : "In Taaable, the AK discovery process consists in learning a set of substitutions from the case base by comparing two sets of recipes.\nThe Training Set. The training set TS is formed by selecting from the case base a set of pairs of recipes (Rk, Rℓ) ∈ CB×CB and by representing for each selected pair of recipes (Rk, Rℓ) the variation ∆kℓ from Rk to Rℓ. The choice of the training set TS results from a set of interactions with the user during which he/she is asked to formulate the cause of the adaptation failure and to pick up a repair strategy.\nRepresenting Variations. The variation ∆kℓ from a recipe Rk to a recipe Rℓ is represented in a language L∆ by a set of properties. Three properties a -, a+ and a= are defined in L∆ for each propositional variable a of V, and ∆kℓ ∈ L∆ contains:\n– the property a- if Rk O a and Rℓ 2O a, – the property a+ if Rk 2O a and Rℓ O a, – the property a= if Rk O a and Rℓ O a.\nFor example, if:\nRk = chinese∧ soup ∧ . . . ∧ peanut oil ∧Nothing else\nRℓ = chinese∧ soup ∧ . . . ∧ olive oil ∧Nothing else\nthen ∆kℓ = {chinese =, soup=, oil=, peanut oil-, olive oil+, . . .}, provided that peanut oil O oil, olive oil O oil, Rℓ 2O peanut oil and Rk 2O olive oil. The inclusion relation ⊆ constitutes a partial order onL∆ that can be used to organize variations by generality: a variation ∆ is more general than a variation ∆′ if ∆ ⊆ ∆′.\nMining. The learning process consists in highlighting some variations ∆ ∈ L∆ that aremore general thana “large” number of elements∆kℓof TS.More formally, let\nsupport(∆) = card {∆kℓ ∈ TS | ∆ ⊆ ∆kℓ}\ncard TS\nLearning adaptation rules aims at finding the ∆ ∈ L∆ such that support(∆) ≥ σs, where σs ∈ [0; 1] is a learning parameter called the support threshold. It can be noticed that if ∆1 ⊆ ∆2 then support(∆1) ≥ support(∆2). The support threshold also has an influence on the number of generated variations. The number of generated variations increases when σs decreases. Thus, specifying a high threshold restricts the generation of variations to the most general ones, which can limit the number of generated variations and save computation time but has the effect to discard the most specific ones from the result set.\nEach learned variation ∆ = {p1, p2, . . . , pn} ∈ L∆ is interpreted as a substitution of the form A B such that:\n– A O a and B 2O a if a - ∈ ∆, – A 2O a and B O a if a + ∈ ∆, – A O a and B O a if a = ∈ ∆.\nFor example, the variation∆ = {oil=, peanut oil-, olive oil+} is interpreted as the substitution Σ = peanut oil olive oil. The conjunct oil is not present neither in A nor in B since it is useless: peanut oil O oil and olive oil O oil.\nFiltering. For a retrieved recipe Sol(srce), the result set can befiltered in order to retain only the substitutions Σ = A B that can be applied tomodify Sol(srce), i.e., such that Sol(srce) O A.\nValidation. Knowledge discovery aims at building a model of reality from a set of observations. But as a model of a part of reality is only valid with respect to a particular observer, any learned substitution has to be validated by a human expert in order to acquire the status of piece of knowledge."

Further solution refinements are proposed to the user. The set of learned variations is filtered in order to retain only the substitutions ∆′ that aremore specific than ∆, i.e., such that ∆ ⊆ ∆′.

In [11], a set of pairs of source cases is selected from the case base and each selected pair of source cases is considered as a specific adaptation rule. The featural differences between problems constitute the antecedent part of the rule and the featural differences between solutions constitute the consequent part. Michalski’s closing interval rule algorithm is then applied to generalize adaptation rule antecedents. In [9], adaptation knowledge takes the form of a set of adaptation cases. Each adaptation case associates an adaptation action to a representation of the differences between the two source problems. Machine learning algorithms like C4.5 or RISE are applied to learn generalized adaptation knowledge from these adaptation cases in order to improve the system’s case-based adaptation procedure.\nWhen applyingmachine learning techniques to learn adaptation knowledge from differences between cases, one main challenge concerns the choice of the training set: which cases are worth comparing? Arguing that (1) the size of the training set should be reduced to minimize the cost of the adaptation rule generationprocess and that (2) the source cases that areworth comparing should be the ones that aremore similar, only the pairs of source cases that were judged to be similar according to a given similarity measure are selected in [9] and [11]. However, committing to a particular similarity measure might be somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, in [5], the authors decided to include in the training set all the pairs of distinct source cases of the case base. This paper introduces a third approach: the choice of the training set is determined interactively and according to the problem-solving context, taking advantage of the fact that the AK discovery process is triggered on-line. This approach appears to be very promising since the learning algorithm can be parametrized in order to learn only the knowledge that is needed to solve the target problem.\nThe examples presented above also show that knowledge discovery techniques allow to come up with more complex adaptation strategies than the simple one-to-one ingredient substitutions generated from the ontology O. In particular, these techniques can help identifying interactions between the different ingredients that appear in the recipes (like e.g., that cocoa contains less fat than baking chocolate, so oil should be removed) as well as co-occurrences of ingredients (like say, that cinnamon is well-suited with apples). Besides, adaptation knowledge is learned at different levels of generality, so the user can be guided into gradual solution refinements.\nSeveral CBR systems make use of interactive and/or opportunistic knowledge acquisition approaches to improve their learning capabilities. For example, in Creek, an approach that combines case-based and model-based methods, general knowledge is acquired through interactions with the user [1]. This knowledge acquisition process is provided in addition to the traditional case acquisition and allows the system to acquire knowledge that cannot be captured through cases only. In the Dial system, adaptation knowledge is acquired in the form of adaptation cases: when a case has to be adapted, the adaptation process is memorized in the form of a case and can be reused to adapt another case. Hence, adaptation knowledge is acquired through a CBR process inside the main CBR cycle. It must be remarked that adaptation cases can either be built automatically by adaptation of previous adaptation cases or manually by a user who interactively builds the adaptation case in response to a problem by selecting the appropriates operations to perform [12]. Hence, knowledge acquisition in Dial appears to be both interactive and opportunistic. Chef is obviously related to thework described here [10]. Chef is a case-basedplanner in the cooking domain, its task is to build recipes on the basis of a user’s request. The input of the system is a set of goals (tastes, textures, ingredients, types of dishes) and the output is a plan for a single recipe that satisfies all the goals. To solve this task, Chef is able to build new plans from old ones stored in memory. The system is provided with the ability to choose plans on the basis of the problems that they solve as well as the goals they satisfy, but it is also able to predict problems and to modify plans to avoid failures (plans are indexed in memory by the problems they avoid). Hence, Chef learns by providing causal explanations of failures thus marking elements as ”predictive” of failures. In other words, the acquired knowledge allows the system to avoid identical failures to occur again. In our approach, we propose to go one step further by using failure to acquire knowledge that can be more widely used."

      "text" : "In this paper, a novel approach for adaptation knowledge acquisition is presented in which the knowledge learned at problem-solving time by knowledge discovery techniques is directly reused for problem-solving. An application is proposed in the context of the cooking CBR system Taaable and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on some use cases. Future work will include\ndeveloping a graphical user interface and doing more extensive testing. Opportunistic and interactive knowledge discovery in Taaable implies that the user plays the role of the domain expert, which raises several issues. For example, how to be sure that the knowledge expressed by a particular user is valuable? How to ensure that the adaptation knowledge base will remain consistent with time? Besides, Taaable is meant to be multi-user, so if the system’s knowledge evolves with experience, some synchronization problems might occur. Therefore, the envisioned multi-user, ever-learning Taaable system needs to be thought of as a collaborative tool in which knowledge acquired by some users can be revised by others."
