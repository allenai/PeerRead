In our proposed approach, a color distribution model is used to detect changes of target's model . Our proposed approach controls deformation of target's model. If deformation of target's model is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm. We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF) . DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos. Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm is not able to track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model. However, DDPF approach updates target's model when the rotation or scaling is occurred.

      "text" : "Multi target tracking is one of the important research areas in computer vision. Human tracking in monitoring applications and aircraft tracking in military applications are known as important applications areas of multi target tracking. Multi target tracking includes two main stages: 1) pose\nestimation and 2) data association. Kalman filtering and grid-based methods are the most important methods for pose estimation that are used in linear systems with Gaussian noises. For linear-Gaussian systems, Kalman filter is an analytical and optimal method. Particle filtering is a numerical and suboptimal method that is used for pose estimation. Unlike the Kalman filtering, Particle filtering method can be used in non-linear system with non-Gaussian noises. This is the\nmost important advantage of particle filtering over other methods. Estimation of manoeuvring\ntarget' s state is one of the most important problems in pose estimation. Multiple Model (MM)\napproach is a common solution to resolve this problem [1-3]. Target' s posteriori density function\nis represented by weighted sum of the output of several parallel filters in MM approach [4]. A\nreal-time approach is presented in [1 5 ] for tracking a manoeuvring target by incorporating dynamic components in the target model. They employed particle filter based tracker. This tracker exploits a first order dynamic model and continuously performs adaptation of model noise for balancing uncertainty between the static and dynamic components of the state vector. The presented experimental evaluation shows that this approach is particularly effective in video sequences where appearance and motion have quick changes and there are partial or full target\nocclusions.\nData association algorithm associates each measurement to track. In cluttered environments, measurements may arise from detected targets or clutter. From the view of implementation, Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) is the simplest method for data association [ 5 ]. Usually, this method is more efficient in clutter-free environments. One of the most common data association methods is Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) [ 6 ]. In this method, the probability of each measurement associated with each track is calculated. Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) is the most complex method for data association that is efficient for cluttered environments [ 7 ]. In MHT method, each hypothesis is a measurement-to-track association. Set of all hypothesizes is considered, and likelihood of each hypothesis is calculated. One of the best methods for obtaining best hypothesis is presented by Nummiaro et. al. [ 8 ]. In MHT method, the best hypothesis is chosen through the set of all hypothesizes by using a statistical approach, whereas in the JPDA method, an average of target state is calculated on all hypothesizes. This is the main difference between JPDA method and MHT method. In this paper, DDPF algorithm is proposed by\nimproving the basic SIR algorithm for tracking the multiple manoeuvring targets using a dynamic model for targets.\nRemaining sections of this paper is organised as follows: In section 2 , particle filter method is\nintroduced briefly. In section 3 , basic SIR particle filter algorithm is introduced and in section 4 ,\ntarget representation model is explained. In section 5 , a dynamic equation for manoeuvring target\nand in section 6 , likelihood function is presented. In section 7 , we briefly describe data\nassociation algorithm. In section 8 , a new method is presented for deformation detection. In\nsection 9 , conditions of experiments is presented . In section 10, we compare results of our\nproposed DDPF method and basic SIR algorithm in multiple manoeuvring target tracking.\nFinally, in section 1 1 , we’ll discuss about and make conclusion from experimental results."

      "text" : "Appropriate pose estimation method should be chosen according to tracking conditions. If the system is linear and system noise is Gaussian, Kalman filter is most appropriate method to pose\nestimation. But, if the system' s dynamic equation is non-linear and system noise is non-Gaussian, an approximation technique should be used. One of the most common numerical and approximation methods to pose estimation is sequential Monte Carlo [9]. This technique is known\nas particle filter [10] or Monte Carlo [11] . Let assume Xt denotes the target' s state at time t , and Zt\ndenotes the set of all measurements zt up to time t . The main idea in particle filtering is representation of probability distribution function (pdf) by a set of weighted samples. Suppose\nthat ( ){ }( ) ( ), | 1,...,n nS s n Nω= = is a set of weighted samples where ( ) 1\n1 N n n ω = =∑ , then the posteriori\ndensity function is represented as follows.\n( ) ( ) 1\n| N i i t t t t t\ni p X Z X Xω δ = ≈ −∑ (1)\nwhere itω is the weight of sample i at time t which is calculated by following equation.\n( ) ( ) ( ) 1 1\n1\n| |\n| ,\ni i i\nt t t ti i t t i i\nt t t\np z X p X X\nq X X z ω ω\n−\n−\n−\n∝ (2)\nw here ( ).q is importance density function which is used in sampling step.

The particle filter method includes two main stages: prediction and update. In the\nprediction stage, particles of next step are obtained by using current particles and state transition equation. In the update stage, a weight is assigned to each particle using the available measurements. After the weight assignment, posteriori density function is calculated by equation\n( 1 ). Then the target' s next state is computed by a weighted average on the next step particles using\nfollowing equation:\n1\nˆ N i i\nt t t\ni X Xω = =∑ (5)"

Accuracy of pose estimation increases by increasing the similarity between importance density function and posteriori density function. Another problem in implementation of particle filter is degeneracy problem. After several iteration of particle filter algorithm, some of the particles have very small\nweight. This means that, some of the particles don’t have effect on calculation of posteriori density function. This is an adverse event. There are two solutions to overcome the degeneracy\nproblem: 1) appropriate choice of importance density function 2) resampling. Both of these\nsolutions are used in SIR approach.

A data association algorithm must detect the measurements that are arisen from clutter. Some of the important data association algorithms are Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN), Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) and Multi Hypothesis Tracking (MHT). GNN is more efficient algorithm for clutter-free environments. Our selected videos in this study had static background and our tracking environment was clutter-free. We used GNN as data association algorithm. Each measurement is associated to nearest track in GNN algorithm. Optimal association minimizes the sum of\ndistances between each measurement and it' s corresponding track. The optimal association can be obtained using a cost matrix and an optimization algorithm. Distance between each measurement and track represents their cost in this matrix. We used Munkres optimization algorithm in our\nstudy that was presented in [1 4 ].\nThis algorithm uses the cost matrix for determining the optimal association . We used three types\nof measurements: 1) grayscale module, 2) RGB module and 3) target detection for deformation\ndetection. Grayscale module and RGB module don' t require data association, because these are\ncalculated for each particle separately. Data association is only used for target detection.\nIn our application, number of targets is constant and predetermined. If the number of detected targets in tracking environment is less than the predetermined number, then at least one of the targets has been occluded by another one. In such case, target detection step is ignored during the occlusion phenomenon. The color histogram and intensity of corresponding pixels are considered\nas observation. Data association won' t be applied during the occlusion phenomenon, because data\nassociation is only used for target detection observation."
