Several approaches have been proposed to measure word similarity (Jarmasz and Szpakowicz, 2003; Levy et al., 2015). Some of them are lexicon-based, while others are corpora-based. The latter generally rely on the distributional hypothesis, according to which words that occur in similar contexts also have similar meanings (Harris, 1954). Although all of them extract statistics from large corpora, they vary in the way they define what has to be considered context (i.e. lexemes, syntax, etc.) and in which way such context is used (Santus et al., 2014a; Hearst, 1992). A common way to represent word meaning in NLP is by using vectors to encode the Strength of Association (SoA) between the target word and its contexts. In the resulting Vector Space Model (VSM), vector cosine is then general-\nCopyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A well-known problem with the statistical approaches is that they rely on a very loose definition of similarity. Indeed, according to the distributional hypothesis, similarity does not only include synonyms, but also other semantic relations, such as hypernymy, co-hyponymy and even antonymy (Santus et al., 2014b-c). For this reason, several datasets have been proposed by the NLP community to test distributional similarity measures (Santus et al., 2015). One of the most used is the English as a Second Language dataset (ESL), introduced in Turney (2001). It consists of 50 multiple-choice synonym questions, with 4 choices each. In this paper, we describe and evaluate APSyn, a completely unsupervised measure that calculates the extent of the intersection among the N most related contexts of two target words, weighting such intersection according to the rank of the contexts in a mutual dependency ranked list. In our experiments, APSyn outperforms the cosine, with an improvement ranging between +9.00% and +17.98% in the ESL test set, depending on the chosen N."

For evaluation, we use the ESL dataset, introduced in Turney (2001) as a way of evaluating algorithms for measuring the degree of word similarity. The test set consists of 50 multiple-choice synonym questions, with 4 choices. Each question was turned into four pairs, having as first word the problem word and as second word one of the possible choices. Some words have been lemmatized, in order to have a correspondent form in the VSM. TASK. We have assigned APSyn scores to all the pairs, and then sorted them in a decreasing order. We considered positive every problem word having the correct answer on top, negative the others. 5 out of 50 questions were excluded, because the correct answers were not present in the VSM. 6 out of 45 questions had one wrong choice missing. In this case, only 0.75 was added if the answer was correct. RESULTS. In Table 1, we report the results in the test.

The measure outperforms the vector cosine and the co-occurrence, plus several\nlexicon-based and hybrid models1. Even though the performance needs to be improved by optimizing the model (i.e. learning the value of N from a training set), our experiments show that the intersection among the N most related contexts of the target words is in fact an index of similarity. It is relevant to mention here also the role of N: the larger the amount of considered contexts, the lower the ability of identifying similarity. This also confirms our hypothesis that similar words share a significant number of top mutually dependent contexts, but such intersection becomes less significant when not only the top contexts are considered. Since ESL is small, the reported results should be further investigated on a larger dataset (Santus et al., 2015).2"
