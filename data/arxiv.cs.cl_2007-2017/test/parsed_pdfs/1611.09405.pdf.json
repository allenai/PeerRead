      "text" : "Keyword spotting (KWS) is a speech task which requires detecting a specific word in an audio signal, commonly for use as the “wake word” of a large-vocabulary (LV) speech recognizer. Voice activity detection (VAD) requires detecting human speech in the signal, often for the purpose of endpointing in a large vocabulary speech recognition system. Both tasks are challenging due to computational constraints and noisy environments. To limit computational cost, VAD models have often leaned on hand-engineered features, requiring training separately from KWS models.\nWe propose instead a single end-to-end neural network architecture for both KWS and VAD. We develop novel inference algorithms which allow us to run KWS and VAD tasks without retraining. Our model outperforms both baselines, is trained only on unaligned character-level transcripts, and requires maintaining only a single architecture for training and deployment."

      "text" : "The model is based on work in end-to-end speech recognition which uses the Connectionist Temporal Classification loss function coupled with deep Recurrent Neural Networks [7, 8]. In this work we develop the model and inference procedure for the KWS and VAD tasks. A thorough treatment of the benefits of this model for LVCSR is given in [1]. A character-level CTC architecture was also recently adopted for keyword spotting [10], where it outperformed a DNN-HMM baseline, while a word-level CTC architecture was used for keyword spotting in [5].\nTraditional VAD architectures trade off accuracy for low computational cost, as they have historically been developed for very low-resource environments. Some simple and efficient techniques include a threshold on the energy of the audio signal, a threshold on the number of zero-crossings [11] or combinations of these features, however, these methods are typically not robust to nonstationary environments. We note that modern LV speech environments afford more computational\n∗Equal contribution\n30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n09 40\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n8 N\nov 2\nresources than before, and the use of larger neural models is feasible, especially for LV ASR endpointing. Neural architectures have been proposed for VAD, notably the RNN architecture in [9], however that approach relied on frame-aligned labels."

      "text" : "For a general keyword spotter, we model p(k|x), where k is a keyword and x is a window of speech. For VAD we use the same distribution and simply set k to the empty string.\nWe use the Connectionist Temporal Classification [6] (CTC) objective function to train an RNN on a corpus of utterance and transcription pairs. The CTC objective gives us the probability of any label string for a given utterance. We do not need an alignment as CTC efficiently computes the score over all possible alignments. The objective function for an utterance x and corresponding transcription ` is given by\npCTC(`|x) = ∑\ns∈align(`,T ) T∏ t p(st|x). (1)\nThe align(·) function computes the set of possible alignments of the transcription ` over the T time-steps of the utterance under the CTC operator. The CTC operator allows for repetitions of any character and insertions of the blank character, , which signifies no output at a given time-step.\nFor the on-line KWS task we must determine with low latency if the keyword has been said. In order to use this model for KWS, we score a moving window of the audio stream x so that we can find the keyword soon after it occurs. The score is computed as pCTC(k|xt:t+w) where k is any keyword and xt:t+w is a window of speech w frames long. For the VAD task we first compute the probability of no speech by setting k to the empty string. From this we can find the probability of speech by taking one minus the probability of no speech."

The network outputs directly to characters in the alphabet including the blank and space characters."

      "text" : "The optimal window size for KWS detection varies per utterance based on speech rate, noise and adjacent utterances. To alleviate the sensitivity of the algorithm to the window size parameter we propose a modification to the CTC scoring algorithm presented above. For a given keyword k instead of scoring k itself under the model we instead score the regular expression [ˆk0]*k[ˆkn−1]*, where k0 and kn−1 are the first and last characters of k, respectively. This is described in Algorithm 1.\nComputing the VAD score reduces to summing the log probabilities of the blank character over the window of speech frames:\nlog p(speech|xt:t+w) = 1− t+w∑ i=t log pi( |xt:t+w).

The second corpus consists of 1544 spoken examples of the keyword, in this case, “Olivia”. The model is trained on both data-sets simultaneously. We do not need to pre-train on the large corpus prior to fine-tuning. We also use a collection of about a hundred hours of noise and music downloaded from the web to generate synthetic noisy examples of the keyword and empty noise clips. When training with the noisy data we replicate each keyword 10 times, each time with a random noise clip. We also use a corpus of 57K randomly sampled noise clips with a blank label as filler.\nThe KWS model is evaluated on a test set of 550 positive examples (e.g. containing the keyword “Olivia“) and 5000 negative examples held-out from the large speech corpus described above. During inference we evaluate the utterance with Algorithm 1 every 100 milliseconds over a window of 800 milliseconds in order to detect the presence of the keyword. We classify an example as positive if the score found from the output of Algorithm 1 over the utterance is ever above a preset threshold.\nWe evaluate the same models on the VAD task. The positive examples are the same 5000 examples of speech used as the negative examples for the KWS task. We collected about 10 hours of nonspeech audio from a variety of noise backgrounds. We sample 5000 random clips from the 10 hours of noise to construct the negative samples."

      "text" : "Our KWS baseline is a DNN keyword spotter from kitt.ai 2. Our VAD baseline is the WebRTC VAD codec3 with frame size 30ms. Our model of 3 layers of size 256 outperforms both baselines.\n2https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy 3https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad\nFor a fixed false positive rate of 5% our model achieves a 98.1% true positive rate on keyword spotting, in comparison to the baseline 96.2%. For the VAD task, for the same false positive rate, our model achieves 99.8% true positive rate vs. 44.6% for the baseline. This large delta may be due to the substantial difference in representational power of a large-parameter neural model vs. the small-parameter GMM baseline, as well as differences in the type and volume of training data.\nFigures 1 and 2 show that our model consistently improves at detecting the keyword as we increase the number of layers and the size of the model. Increasing the model depth and size also improves VAD performance; however, when the layers are larger than 128 units or there are more than 2 layers, VAD performance saturates. Most of the large VAD models achieve near 99.9% true positive rate or higher at a fixed false positive rate of 5.0%.\nIn Figure 3 we see that adding noise to the keywords during training results in substantial improvements. At a false positive rate of 5% the model with noise has a true positive rate of 98.9% compared to 94.3% for the model without noise. Further using the random noise data on its own does not help much; in fact the results are slightly worse. On the VAD task we also notice an improvement in the ROC curve as we add noise.\nOur production model with 3 layers of 256 hidden units has ∼1.5M trainable parameters, comparable to other neural network-based KWS approaches [2], and has been deployed to a modern smartphone."

The model is simple to train and does not require an alignment or frame-wise labels, in contrast to prior VAD models. We propose inference algorithms\nfor KWS and VAD modified from the basic CTC scoring algorithm which allow the model to perform both tasks. While our model is efficient, applying neural compression techniques might further increase performance and represents an interesting area for future work."
