However, there is a dearth of theoretical analysis to explain why we can effectively capture the features in our data with binary weights and activations. Our main result is that the neural networks with binary weights and activations trained using the method of Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016) work because of the high-dimensional geometry of binary vectors. In particular, the ideal continuous vectors that extract out features in the intermediate representations of these BNNs are well-approximated by binary vectors in the sense that dot products are approximately preserved. Compared to previous research that demonstrated the viability of such BNNs, our work explains why these BNNs work in terms of the HD geometry. Our theory serves as a foundation for understanding not only BNNs but a variety of methods that seek to compress traditional neural networks. Furthermore, a better understanding of multilayer binary neural networks serves as a starting point for generalizing BNNs to other neural network architectures such as recurrent neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 21:33:00 GMT  (264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07199v1", "12 pages, 4 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 4 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexander g", "erson", "cory p berg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07199"}
