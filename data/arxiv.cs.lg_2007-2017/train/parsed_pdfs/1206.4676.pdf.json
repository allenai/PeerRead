Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nnegativity constraint, together with various low-rank matrix approximation objectives, has widely been used for the relaxation purpose in the past decade.\nThe most popular nonnegative low-rank approximation method is Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). It finds a matrix that approximates the similarities and can be factorized into several nonnegative low-rank matrices. NMF was originally applied to vectorial data, where Ding et al. (2010) have shown that NMF is equivalent to the classical k-means method. Later NMF was applied to the (weighted) graph given by the pairwise similarities. For example, Ding et al. (2008) presented Nonnegative Spectral Cuts by using a multiplicative algorithm; Arora et al. (2011) proposed Left Stochastic Decomposition that approximates a similarity matrix based on Euclidean distance and a left-stochastic matrix. Another stream in the same direction is topic modeling. Hofmann (1999) gave a generative model in Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI) for counting data, which is essentially equivalent to NMF using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Tri-factorizations. Bayesian treatment of PLSI by using Dirichlet prior was later introduced by Blei et al. (2001). Symmetric PLSI with the same Bayesian treatment is called Interaction Component Model (ICM) (Sinkkonen et al., 2008).\nDespite remarkable progress, the above relaxation approaches are still not fully satisfactory in all of the following requirements that affect the clustering performance using nonnegative low-rank approximation: (1) approximation error measure that takes into account sparse similarities, (2) decomposition form of the approximating matrix, where the decomposing matrices should contain just enough parameters for clustering but not more, and (3) normalization of the approximating matrix, which ensures relatively balanced clusters and equal contribution of each data sample. Lacking one or more of these dimensions can severely affect clustering performance.\nIn this paper we present a new nonnegative low-rank approximation method for clustering, which satisfies all of the above three requirements. First, because datasets often lie in curved manifolds such that only similarities in a small neighborhood are reliable, we adopt KL-divergence to handle the resulting sparsity. Second, different from PLSI, we enforce an equal contribution of every data sample and then directly construct the decomposition over the probabilities from samples to clusters. Third, these probabilities form the only decomposing matrix to be learned in our approach and directly gives the answer for probabilistic clustering. Furthermore, our decomposition method leads to a doubly-stochastic approximating matrix, which was shown to be desired for balanced graph cuts (Zass & Shashua, 2006). We name our new method DCD because it is based on Data-Cluster-Data random walks.\nIn order to solve the DCD learning objective, we propose a novel relaxed Majorization-Minimization algorithm to handle the new matrix decomposition type. Our relaxation strategy works robustly in finding sastisfactory local optimizers under the stochasticity constraint. Furthermore, we argue that complexity control such as Bayesian priors only provides initialization for the new algorithm. This eliminates the problem of hyperparameter selection in the prior.\nEmpirical comparison with NMF and other graphbased clustering approaches demonstrates that our method can achieve the best or nearly the best clustering purity in all tasks. For some datasets, the new method significantly improves the state-of-the-art.\nAfter this introductory part, we present the new method in Section 2, including its learning objective, probabilistic model, optimization and initialization techniques. In Section 3, we point out the connections and differences between our method and other recent related work. Experimental settings and results are given in Section 4. Finally we conclude the paper and discuss some future work in Section 5."

This matrix can be seen as (weighted) affinity of an undirected similarity graph where each node corresponds to a data sample (data node). A clustering analysis algorithm takes such input and divides the data nodes into r disjoint subsets. In probabilistic clustering analysis, we want to find P (k|i), the probability of assigning the ith sample to the kth cluster,\nwhere i = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , r.

      "text" : "Some of our work was inspired by the AnchorGraph (Liu et al., 2010) which was used in large approximative graph construction based on a two-step random walk between data nodes through a set of anchor nodes. Note that AnchorGraph is not a clustering method.\nIf we augment the input similarity graph by r cluster nodes, the cluster assigning probabilities can be seen as single-step random walk probabilities from data nodes to the augmented cluster nodes. Without preference to any particular samples, we impose uniform prior P (i) = 1/n over the data nodes. By this prior, the reversed random walk probabilities can then be calculated by the Bayes formula\nP (i|k) = P (k|i)P (i)∑ v P (k|v)P (v) = P (k|i)∑ v P (k|v) . (1)\nConsider next the probability of two-step random walks from ith data node to jth data node via all cluster nodes (DCD random walk):\nP (i|j) = ∑ k P (i|k)P (k|j) = ∑ k P (k|i)P (k|j)∑ v P (k|v) . (2)\nThis probability defines another similarity between two data nodes, Âij = P (i|j), with respect to cluster nodes. Note that this matrix has rank at most equal to r. The learning target is now to find a good approximation between the input similarities and the DCD random walk probabilities:\nA ≈ Â. (3)\nAnchorGraph does not provide any error measure for the above approximation. A conventional choice in NMF is the squared Euclidean distance, which employs the underlying assumption that the noise is additive and Gaussian.\nIn real-world clustering tasks for multivariate datasets, data points often lie in a curved manifold. Consequently, similarities based on Euclidean distances are reliable only in a small neighborhood. Such locality causes high sparsity in the input similarity matrix. Sparsity also commonly exists for real-world network data. Because of the sparsity, Euclidean distance is improper for the approximation in Eq. (3), because additive Gaussian noise should lead to a dense\nobserved graph. In contrast, (generalized) KullbackLeibler divergence is more suitable for the approximation. The underlying Poisson noise characterizes rare occurrences that are present in our sparse input. We can now formulate our learning objective as the following optimization problem:\nmin W≥0 DKL(A||Â) = ∑ ij\n( Aij log Aij\nÂij −Aij + Âij ) (4)\ns.t. ∑ k Wik = 1, i = 1, . . . , n, (5)\nwhere we write Wik = P (k|i) for convenience and thus\nÂij = ∑ k WikWjk∑ vWvk . (6)\nNote that Â is symmetric as it is easy to verify that P (i|j) = P (j|i). Therefore, Â is also doubly stochastic because it is left-stochastic by probability definition."

Dropping the constant terms from DKL(A||Â), the objective is equivalent to maximizing ∑\nij\nAij log Âij .

It does not prevent from using informative priors or complexity control. A natural choice for probabilities is the Dirichlet distribution (α > 0)\np(Wi1, . . . ,Wir|α) = Γ(rα)\n[Γ(α)] r r∏ k=1 Wα−1ik , (8)\nwhich is also the conjugate prior of multinomial distribution. The Dirichlet prior reduces to be uniform when α = 1.\nAlthough it is possible to construct a multi-level graphical model similar to the Dirichlet process topic model, we emphasize that the smallest approximation error (or perplexity) is our final goal. Dirichlet prior is used only in order to ease the optimization. Therefore we do not employ more complex generative models; see Section 2.4 for more discussion."

(5). First, one can develop the multiplicative algorithm by the procedure proposed by Yang & Oja (2011) by neglecting the stochasticity constraint, and then normalize the rows of W after each update. However, the optimization by this way easily gets stuck in poor local minima in practice.\nHere we employ a relaxing strategy to handle the constraint. We first introduce Lagrangian multipliers for the constraints:\nL(W,λ) = J (W ) + ∑ i λi (∑ k Wik − 1 ) . (10)\nUnlike traditional constrained optimization that solves the fixed-point equations, we employ a heuristic to find the multipliers λ. Denote ∇ = ∇+ −∇− the gradient of J with respect to W , where ∇+ and ∇− are the positive and (unsigned) negative parts, respectively. This suggests a fixed-point update rule for W :\nW ′ik = Wik ∇−ik − λi ∇+ik . (11)\nImposing ∑ kW ′ ik = 1, we obtain\nλi = bi − 1 ai , (12)\nwhere ai and bi are given in Algorithm 1.

It holds that L(Wnew, λ) ≤ L(W,λ) with λi = (bi − 1)/ai.\nProof. The algorithm construction mainly follows the Majorization-Minimization procedure (see e.g. Yang &\nOja, 2011).

Therefore, L(W new, λ) ≤ G(W new,W ) ≤ L(W,λ).\nAlgorithm 1 jointly minimizes the approximation error and drives the rows of W towards the probability simplex. The Lagrangian multipliers are automatically selected by the algorithm, without extra human tuning labor. The quantities bi are the row sums of the unconstrained multiplicative learning result, while the quantities ai balance between the gradient learning force and the probability simplex attraction. Besides convenience, we find that this relaxation strategy works more robustly than the brute-force normalization after each iteration."

      "heading" : "2.4. Initialization",
      "text" : "The optimization problems of many clustering analysis methods, including ours, are non-convex. Usually finding the global optimum is very expensive or even NP-hard. When local optimizers are used, the optimization trajectory can easily get stuck in poor local optima if the algorithm starts from an arbitrary random guess. Proper initialization is thus needed to achieve satisfactory performance.\nThe cost of the initialization should be much cheaper than the main algorithm. There are two popular choices: k-means and Normalized Cut (Ncut). The first one can only be applied to vectorial data and could be slow for large-scale high-dimensional data. Here we employ the second initialization method. While the original Ncut is NP-hard, the relaxed Ncut\nproblem can be efficiently solved via spectral methods (Shi & Malik, 2000). Furthermore, it is particularly suitable for sparse graph input, which is our focus in this paper.\nBesides Ncut, we emphasize that the minimal approximation error is our sole learning objective and all regularized versions, e.g. with different Dirichlet priors, only serve as initialization. This is because clustering analysis, unlike supervised learning problems, does not need to provide inference for unseen data. That is, the complexity control such as Bayesian priors is not meant for better generalization performance, but for better-shaped space to facilitate optimization. In this sense, we can use the results of diverse regularized versions or even other clustering algorithms as starting guesses, and pick the one with the smallest approximation error among multiple runs.\nIn implementation, we first convert an initialization clustering result to an n × r binary indicator matrix, and then add a small positive perturbation to all entries. Next, the perturbed matrix is fed to our optimization algorithm (with α = 1 in Algorithm 1)."

      "heading" : "3.1. Topic Model",
      "text" : "A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents. An early topic model was PLSI (Hofmann, 1999) which maximizes the following log-likelihood for symmetric input A:∑\nij Aij log ∑ k P (k)P (i|k)P (j|k). (14)\nOne can see that PLSI has similar form as Eq. (7). Both objectives can be equivalently expressed by nonnegative low-rank approximation using KL-divergence.\nThe major difference is the decomposition form of the approximating matrix. There are two ways to model the hierarchy between latent variables and the observed ones. Topic model uses the pure generative way while our method employs the discriminative way. PLSI gives the clustering results indirectly. One should apply Bayes formula to evaluate P (k|i) using P (i|k) and P (k). There are n× r − 1 free parameters to be learned in the latter two quantities. In contrast, our method directly learns the cluster assigning prob-\nabilities P (k|i) which contains only n × (r − 1) free parameters. This difference can be large when there are only a few clusters (e.g. r = 2 or r = 3).\nIt is known that the performance of PLSI can be improved by using Bayesian non-parametric modeling. Bayesian treatment for the symmetric version of PLSI leads to Interaction Component Model (Sinkkonen et al., 2008). It associates Dirichlet priors to the PLSI factorizing matrices and then makes use of the conjugacy between Dirichlet and multinomial to derive collapsed Gibbs sampling or variational optimization methods.\nAn open problem of Bayesian methods is how to determine the hyperparameters that control the priors. Asuncion et al. (2009) found that wrongly chosen parameters can lead to only mediocre or even poor performance. The automatic hyperparameters updating method proposed by Minka (2000) does not necessarily lead to good solution in terms of perplexity (Asuncion et al., 2009) or clustering purity in our experiments (see Section 4). Hofmann (1999); Asuncion et al. (2009) suggested to select the hyperparameters using the smallest approximation error for some heldout matrix entries, which is however more costly and might weaken or even break the cluster structure.\nBy contrast, there is no such prior hyperparameter selection problem in our method. The algorithms using various priors only play their role in the initialization. Among the runs with different starting points, we simply select the one with the smallest approximation error."

The research on NMF also opened the door for multiplicative majorization-minimization algorithms for optimization over nonnegative matrices. In the original NMF, an input nonnegative matrix X is approximated by a product of two low-rank matricesW andH. Later researchers found that more constraints or normalizations should be imposed on the factorizing matrices to achieve desired performance.\nOrthogonality is a popular choice (see e.g. Ding et al., 2006) for highly sparse factorizing matrices, especially the cluster indicator matrix. However, the orthogonality constraint seems exclusive of other constraints or priors. In practice, the orthogonality favors Euclidean distance as the approximation error measure for simple update rules, which is against our requirement for\nsparse graph input.\nStochasticity seems more natural for relaxing hard clustering to probabilities. Recently Arora et al. (2011) proposed a symmetric NMF using leftstochastic factorizing matrices called LSD. Their method also directly learns the cluster assigning probabilities. However, LSD is also restricted to Euclidean distance.\nOur method has two major differences from LSD. First, we use Kullback-Leibler divergence which is more suitable for sparse graph input or curved manifold data. This also enables us to make use of the Dirichlet and multinomial conjugacy pair. Second, our decomposition has good interpretation in terms of a random walk. Furthermore, imbalanced clustering is implicitly penalized because of the denominator in Eq. (6)."

First of all, AnchorGraph is not made for clustering, but for constructing the graph input. AnchorGraph has no learning objective that captures the global structure of data such as clusters. Each row of the decomposing matrix in AnchorGraph is learned individually and only encodes the local information. There is no learning over the decomposing matrix as a whole. Furthermore, anchors are either selected from data samples or pre-learned by e.g. kmeans. By contrast, cluster nodes in our formulation are virtual.

We implemented NSC, PNMF, ONMF, LSD, PLSI, and DCD using multiplicative updates. For these methods, we ran their update rules for 10,000 iterations to ensure that all algorithms have sufficiently converged. We used the default setting for 1-Spec. ICM uses collapsed Gibbs sampling, where each round of the sampling sweeps the graph once. We ran the ICM sampling for 100,000 rounds to ensure that the MCMC burn-in is converged (it took about one day for the largest dataset). The hyperparameters in ICM are automatically adjusted by using Minka’s method (Minka, 2000).\nDespite mediocre results, Ncut runs very fast and gives pretty stable outputs. We thus used it for initialization. After getting the Ncut cluster indicator matrix, we add 0.2 to all entries and feed it as starting point for other methods, which is a common initialization setting for NMF methods. The other three initialization points for our method are provided by Ncut followed by DCD using three different Dirichlet priors (α = 1.2, α = 2, and α = 5).

Experimental results showed that our method works robustly for various selected datasets and can improve clustering purity for large manifold datasets.\nThere are some other dimensions that affect clustering performance. Our practice indicates that initialization could play an important role because most current algorithms are only local optimizers. Using Dirichlet prior is only one way to smooth the objective function space. One could use other priors or regularization techniques to achieve better initializations.\nAnother dimension is the input graph. We have focused on the grouping procedure given that the similarities are precomputed. One should notice that better features or a better similarity measure can significantly improve clustering purity. Though we did not use AnchorGraph for the sake of including topic models in our comparison, it could be more beneficial to construct both approximated and approximating matrices by the same principle. This also suggests that clustering analysis could be performed in a deeper way using hierarchical pre-training. Detailed implementation should be investigated in the future."

However, most approximation approaches in this direction are still restricted to matrix factorization. We propose a new low-rank learning method to improve the clustering performance, which is beyond matrix factorization. The approximation is based on a twostep bipartite random walk through virtual cluster nodes, where the approximation is formed by only cluster assigning probabilities. Minimizing the approximation error measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of a discriminative model, which endows our method with a solid probabilistic interpretation. The optimization is implemented by a relaxed Majorization-Minimization algorithm that is advantageous in finding good local minima. Furthermore, we point out that the regularized algorithm with Dirichlet prior only serves as initialization. Experimental results show that the new method has strong performance in clustering purity for various datasets, especially for large-scale manifold data.",
