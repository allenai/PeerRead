      "text" : "Previous theoretical work on deep learning and neural network optimization tend to focus on avoiding saddle points and local minima. However, the practical observation is that, at least for the most successful Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for visual processing, practitioners can always increase the network size to fit the training data (an extreme example would be [1]). The most successful DCNNs such as VGG and ResNets are best used with a small degree of “overparametrization”. In this work, we characterize with a mix of theory and experiments, the landscape of the empirical risk of overparametrized DCNNs. We first prove the existence of a large number of degenerate global minimizers with zero empirical error (modulo inconsistent equations). The zero-minimizers – in the case of classification – have a non-zero margin. The same minimizers are degenerate and thus very likely to be found by SGD that will furthermore select with higher probability the zero-minimizer with larger margin, as discussed in Theory III (to be released). We further experimentally explored and visualized the landscape of empirical risk of a DCNN on CIFAR-10 during the entire training process and especially the global minima. Finally, based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose an intuitive model of the landscape of DCNN’s empirical loss surface, which might not be as complicated as people commonly believe.\nThis work was supported by the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM), funded by NSF STC award CCF - 1231216.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n09 83\n3v 1\nContents"

      "text" : "We characterize the landscape of the empirical risk from three perspectives:\n• Section 3. Theoretical Analyses: We study the nonlinear system of equations corresponding to critical points of the gradient of the loss (for the L2 loss function) and to zero minimizers, corresponding to interpolating solutions. In the equations the functions representing the network’s output contain the RELU nonlinearity. We consider an - approximation of it in the sup norm using a polynomial approximation or the corresponding Legendre expansion. We can then invoke Bezout theorem to conclude that there are a very large number of zero-error minima, and that the zero-error minima are highly degenerate, whereas the local non-zero minima, if they exist, may not be degenerate. In the case of classification, zero error implies the existence of a margin, that is a flat region in all dimensions around zero error.\n• Section 4. Visualizations and Experimental Explorations: The theoretical results indicate that there are degenerate global minima in the loss surface of DCNN. However, it is unclear how the rest of the landscape look like. To gain more knowledge about this, we visualize the landscape of the entire training process using Multidimensional Scaling. We also probe locally the landscape at different locations by perturbation and interpolation experiments.\n• Section 5. A simple model of the landscape. Summarizing our theoretical and experimental results, we propose a simple baseline model for the landscape of empirical risk, as shown in Figure 1. We conjecture that the loss surface of DCNN is not as complicated as commonly believed. At least in the case of overparametrized DCNNs, the loss surface might be simply a collection of (highdimensional) basins, which have some of the following interesting properties: 1. Every basin reaches a flat global minima. 2. The basins may be rugged such that any perturbation or noise leads to a slightly different convergence path. 3. Despite being perhaps locally rugged, the basin has a relatively regular overall landscape such that the average of two model within a basin gives a model whose error is roughly the average of (or even lower than) the errors of original two models. 4. Interpolation between basins, on the other hand, may significantly raise the error. 5. There might be some good properties in each basin such that there is no local minima — we do not encounter any local minima in CIFAR, even when training with batch gradient descent without noise."

      "text" : "Deep Learning references start with Hinton’s backpropagation and with LeCun’s convolutional networks (see for a nice review [2]). Of course, multilayer convolutional networks have been around at least as far back as the optical processing era of the 70s. The Neocognitron[3] was a convolutional neural network that was trained to recognize characters. The property of compositionality was a main motivation for hierarchical models of visual cortex such as HMAX which can be regarded as a pyramid of AND and OR layers[4], that is a sequence of conjunctions and disjunctions. In “Theory of Deep Learning I” we have provided formal conditions under which deep networks can avoid the curse of dimensionality. More specifically, several papers have appeared on the landscape of the training error for deep networks. Techniques borrowed from the physics of spin glasses (which in turn were based on old work by Marc Kac on the zeros of algebraic equations) were used [5] to suggest the existence of a band of local minima of high quality as measured by the test error. The argument however depends on a number of assumptions which are rather implausible (see [6] and [7] for comments and further work on the problem). Soudry and Carmon [6] show that with mild over-parameterization and dropout-like noise, training error for a neural network with one hidden layer and piece-wise linear activation is zero at every local minimum. All these results suggest that the energy landscape of deep neural networks should be easy to optimize. They more or less hold in practice —it is easy to optimize a prototypical deep network to near-zero loss on the training set. In this paper and Theory III, we provide a general justification and characterization of global minimizers and why are they easier to find than local minima by SGD."

We also assume overparametrization, that is more weights than data points, since this is how successful deep networks have been used.\nUnder these conditions, we will show that imposing zero empirical error provides a system of equations (at the zeros) that have a large number of degenerate solutions in the weights. The equations are polynomial in the weights, with coefficients reflecting components of the data vectors (one vector per data point). The system of equations is underdetermined (more unknowns than equations, e.g. data points) because of the assumed overparametrization. Because the global minima are degenerate, that is flat in many of the dimensions, they are more likely to be found by SGD than local minima which are less degenerate.\nIn Theory III we will show then that for the weights regions corresponding to global minima of the empirical error, SGD will generalize well."

      "text" : "The following analysis of the landscape of the empirical risk is based on two assumptions that hold true in most applications of deep convolutional networks:\n1. overparametrization of the network, typically using several times more parameters (the weights of the network) than data points. In practice, even with data augmentation, one can always make the model larger to achieve overparametrization without sacrificing either the training or generalization performance.\n2. each of the equations corresponding to zeros of the empirical risk (training assumed in a regression framework attempting to minimize a loss such as square loss or cross-entropy) can be approximated by a polynomial equation in the weights, by a polynomial approximaton within (in the sup norm) of the RELU nonlinearity.\nThe main observation is that the degree of each approximating equation `d( ) is determined by the accuracy we desire for approximating the ReLU activation by a univariate polynomial P of degree `( ) and by the number of layers d.1 In the well-determined case (as many unknown weights as equations, that is data points), Bezout theorem provides an upper bound on the number of solutions. The number of distinct zeros (counting points at infinity, using projective space, assigning an appropriate multiplicity to each intersection point, and excluding degenerate cases) would be equal to Z - the product of the degrees of each of the equations. Since the system of equations is usually underdetermined – as many equations as data points but more unknowns (the weights) – we expect an infinite number of global minima, under the form of Z regions of zero empirical error. If the equations are inconsistent there are still many global minima of the squared error that is solutions of systems of equations with a similar form.\nNotice that the equations have a particular compositional form characterized in “Theory I” (see especially Corollary 4)."

In particular, we consider the zeros on the training set of a network with ReLUs activation approximating a function of four variables with the following structure:\nf(x1, x2, x3, x4) = g(h(x1, x2), h ′(x3, x4)). (1)\nWe assume that the deep approximation network uses ReLUs as follows\ng(h, h) = A(W1h+W2h+W3)+ +B(W ′ 1h+W ′ 2h+W ′ 3)+ (2)\nand h(x1, x2) = a(w1x1 + w2x2 + w3)+ + b(v1x1 + v2x2 + v3)+, (3)\nh′(x3, x4) = a ′(w′1x1 + w ′ 2x2 + w ′ 3)+ + b ′(v′1x1 + v ′ 2x2 + v ′ 3)+. (4)\n1Of course we have to contrain the range of values allowed in the argument of the RELUs to be able to set the polynomial P that achieves accuracy .\nThere are usually quite a few more units in the first and second layer than the 2 of the example above.\nThis example generalizes to the case in which the kernel support is larger than 2 (for instance is 3x3 = 9 as in ResNets). In the standard case each node (for instance in the first layer) contains quite a few units (O(100)) and as many outputs. However, the effective outputs are much fewer so that each is the linear combination of several ReLUs units as shown in the Appendix.\nConsider Figure 2. The approximating polynomial equations for the zero of the empirical errors for this network, which could be part of a larger network, are, for i = 1, · · · , N where N are the data points:\nP (W1P (w1xi,1 + w2xi,2 + w3) +W2P (w1xi,3 + w2xi,4 + w3)+ (5)\n+W3)− yi = 0 (6)\nThe above equations describe the simple case of one ReLU per node for the case of the network of Figure 2. Equations 5 are a system of underconstrained polynomial equations of degree ld. In general, there are as many constraints as data points i = 1, · · · , N for a much larger number K of unknown weights W,w, · · · . There are no solutions if the system is inconsistent – which happens if and only if 0 = 1 is a linear combination (with polynomial coefficients) of the equations (this is Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz). Otherwise, it has infinitely many complex solutions: the set of all solutions is an algebraic set of dimension at least K − N . If the underdetermined system is chosen at random the dimension is equal to K −N with probability one.\nEven in the non-degenerate case (as many data as parameters), Bezout theorem suggests that there are many solutions. With d layers the degree of the polynomial equations is `d. With N datapoints the Bezout upper bound in the zeros of the weights is `Nd. Even if the number of real zero – corresponding to zero empirical error – is much smaller (Smale and Shub estimate [8] l Nd 2 ), the number is still enormous: for a CiFAR situation this may be as high as 210 5 ."

If the equations are inconsistent it seems likely that global minima with similar properties exist.\nCorollary 1. In general, non-zero minima exist with higher dimensionality than the zero-error global minima: their dimensionality is the number of weights K vs. the number of data points N . This is true in the linear case and also in the presence of ReLUs.\nLet us consider the same example as before looking at the critical points of the gradient. With a square loss function the critical points of the gradient are:\n∇w N∑ i=1 (f(xi)− yi)2) = 0 (7)\nwhich gives K equations\nN∑ i=1 (f(xi)− yi)2)∇wf(xi) = 0.

They are of course satisfied by the degenerate zeros of the empirical error but also by additional non-degenerate (in the general case) solutions.\nWe summarize our main observations on the approximating system of equations in the following\nProposition 1.

We record a large number of intermediate models during the process of several training schemes. Each model is a high dimensional point with the number of dimensions being the number of parameters. The strain-based MDS algorithm is applied to such points and a corresponding set of 2D points are found such that the dissimilarity matrix between the 2D points are as similar to those of the high-dimensional points as possible. One minus cosine similarity is used as the dissimilarity metric. This is more robust to scaling of the weights, which is usually normalized out by BNs.

The perturbation is performed by adding a gaussian noise to the weights of each layer with the standard deviation being 0.01 times layer’s standard deviation.

      "text" : "In this section, we propose a simple baseline model for the landscape of empirical risk that is consistent with all of our theoretical and experimental findings. In the case of overparametrized DCNNs, here is a recapitulation of our main observations:\n• Theoretically, we show that there are a large number of global minimizers with zero (or small) empirical error. The same minimizers are degenerate.\n• Regardless of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Batch Gradient Descent (BGD), a small perturbation of the model almost always leads to a slightly different convergence path. The earlier the perturbation is in the training process the more different the final model would be.\n• Interpolating two “nearby” convergence paths lead to another convergence path with similar errors every epoch. Interpolating two “distant” models lead to raised errors.\n• We do not observe local minima, even when training with BGD.\nThere is a simple model that is consistent with above observations. As a first-order characterization, we believe that the landscape of empirical risk is simply a collection of (hyper) basins that each has a flat global minima. Illustrations are provided in Figure 1 and Figure 33 (a concrete 3D case).\nAs shown in Figure 1 and Figure 33, the building block of the landscape is a basin.How does a basin look like in high dimension? Is there any evidence for this model? One definition of a hyper-basin would be that as loss decreases, the hypervolume of the parameter space decreases: 1D (a slice of 2D), 2D and 3D examples are shown in Figure 33 (A), (B), (C), respectively. As we can see, with the same amount of scaling in each dimension, the volume shrinks much faster as the number of dimension increases — with a linear decrease in each dimension, the hypervolume decreases as a exponential function of the number of dimensions. With the number of dimensions being the number of parameters, the volume shrinks incredibly fast. This leads to a phenomenon that we all observe experimentally: whenever one perturb a model by adding some significant noise, the loss almost always never go down. The larger the perturbation is, the more the error increases. The reasons are simple if the local landscape is a hyper-basin: the volume of a lower loss area is so small that by randomly perturbing the point, there is almost no chance getting there. The larger the perturbation is, the more likely it will get to a much higher loss area.\nThere are, nevertheless, other plausible variants of this model that can explain our experimental findings. In Figure 34, we show one alternative model we call “basin-fractal”. This model is more elegant while being also consistent with most of the above observations. The key difference between simple basins and “basin-fractal” is that in “basin-fractal”, one should be able to find “walls” (raised errors) between two models within the same basin. Since it is a fractal, these “walls” should be present at all levels of errors. For the moment, we only discovered “walls” between two models the trajectories lead to which are very different (obtained either by splitting very early in training, as shown in Figure 10 (a) and Figure 12 (a) or by a very significant perturbation, as shown in Figure 12 (b)). We have not found other significant “walls” in all other perturbation and interpolation experiments. So a first order model of the landscape would be just a collection of simple basins. Nevertheless, we do find “basin-fractal” elegant, and perhaps the “walls” in the low loss areas are just too flat to be noticed.\nAnother surprising finding about the basins is that, they seem to be so “smooth” such that there is no local minima. Even when training with batch gradient descent, we do not encounter any local minima. When trained long enough with small enough learning rates, one always gets to 0 classification error and negligible cross entropy loss.\nHigh Loss\nLow Loss\n(A) Profile view of a basin with flat global minima (B) Top-down view of the basin (2D)\nHigh Loss\nFlat Global Minima\nLow Loss\nFlat Global Minima There may be small obstacles/bumps, can be any shape"

The main difference is that the perturbations are smaller. The classification errors are even 0 after the perturbation and throughout the entire following training process."

    "abstractText" : "Previous theoretical work on deep learning and neural network optimization tend to focus on avoiding saddle points and local minima. However, the practical observation is that, at least for the most successful Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for visual processing, practitioners can always increase the network size to fit the training data (an extreme example would be ). The most successful DCNNs such as VGG and ResNets are best used with a small degree of “overparametrization”. In this work, we characterize with a mix of theory and experiments, the landscape of the empirical risk of overparametrized DCNNs. We first prove the existence of a large number of degenerate global minimizers with zero empirical error (modulo inconsistent equations). The zero-minimizers – in the case of classification – have a non-zero margin. The same minimizers are degenerate and thus very likely to be found by SGD that will furthermore select with higher probability the zero-minimizer with larger margin, as discussed in Theory III (to be released). We further experimentally explored and visualized the landscape of empirical risk of a DCNN on CIFAR-10 during the entire training process and especially the global minima. Finally, based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose an intuitive model of the landscape of DCNN’s empirical loss surface, which might not be as complicated as people commonly believe.
