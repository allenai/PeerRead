      "text" : "As very large structured knowledge bases (KBs) have become available, e.g., Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008), YAGO (Suchanek et al., 2007) and DBpedia (Auer et al., 2007), KBs have become a new source of potential answers for people to mine. Answering factoid questions over such structured KBs, known as KB-based question answering (or KBQA), is attracting increasing research efforts from both information retrieval and natural language processing communities.\nThe state-of-the-art methods for this task can be categorized into two streams. The first is based on semantic parsing (Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), which typically learns a grammar that can parse natural language to a sophisticated\nmeaning representation language. But such sophistication requires a lot of annotated training examples that contains compositional structures which is practically impossible for large KBs such as Freebase. Furthermore, mismatches between grammar predicted structures and KB structure is also a common problem (Kwiatkowski et al., 2013; Berant and Liang, 2014; Reddy et al., 2014).\nOn the other hand, instead of building a formal meaning representation, information extraction methods retrieve a set of candidate answers from KB using relation extraction (Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Yih et al., 2014; Yao, 2015; Bast and Haussmann, 2015) or distributed representations (Bordes et al., 2014; Dong et al., 2015). Designing large training datasets for these methods is relatively easy (Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Bordes et al., 2015). These methods are often good at producing an answer irrespective of their correctness. However, handling compositional questions that involve multiple entities and relations, still remains a challenge. Consider the question what mountain is the highest in north america. Relation extraction methods typically answer with all the mountains in North America because of the lack of sophisticated representation for the mathematical function highest. To select the correct answer, one has to retrieve all the heights of the mountains, and sort them in descending order, and then pick the first entry. We propose a method based on text based evidence which help solve this problem without having to do this.\nKnowledge bases like Freebase capture real world facts which people are interested in, and web like Wikipedia provides a large repository of sentences\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n00 95\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nM ar\nthat validate or support these facts. For example, a sentence in Wikipedia says, Denali (also known as Mount McKinley, its former official name) is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190 m) above sea level. To answer our example question on a KB using a relation extractor, we can use this sentence as external evidence, and filter out wrong answers and pick the correct one.\nUsing external evidence not only mitigates representational issues in relation extraction, it also alleviates data scarcity problem to some extent. Consider the question, Who was queen isabella’s mother. Answering this question involves predicting two constraints hidden in the word mother. One constraint is the answer should be the parent of Isabella, and the other is the answer’s gender is female. Such words with multiple latent constraints have been a pain-in-the-neck for both semantic parsing and relation extraction approaches, and requires larger training data (this phenomenon is coined as sub-lexical compositionally by Wang et al. (2015)). Most systems are good at triggering the parent constraint, but fail on the other. The textual evidence from Wikipedia, . . . her mother was Isabella of Barcelos . . . , can act as a further constraint to answer the question.\nWe present a novel method for answering factoid questions, which infers both on structured and unstructured resources. Figure 1 gives an overview. First we employ a relation extractor to find answer entities from a KB (indicated by KB-QA box). Then a refinement model uses textual evidence to select answer entities (indicated by Answer Refinement box). The main contributions of this paper are two-fold.\n• We treat the KB-QA problem as a joint task of relation extraction and entity linking, and further propose an Multi Channel Convolutional Neural Network (MCCNN) (Section 4.2) to learn a robust relation representation. By performing a joint inference approach (Section 4.3), our KB-based approach obtains competitive results on WEBQUESTIONS.\n• We introduce a refinement model to further validate the answers (Section 5). Experimental results show that our system outperforms the state-of-the-\nart systems on WEBQUESTIONS."

For both entity linking and relation extraction components, we keep up to 5 top ranked entities and relations, and develop a joint inference model to find the best entity-relation configuration, and accordingly retrieve candidate answers from Freebase.

All actors as the answers of this question should satisfy the following two constraints: (1)\nthe actor played anakin skywalker; and (2) the actor played in star wars 1. Inspired by (Bao et al., 2014), we design a dependency tree-based method to handle such multiple-constraint questions. In general, we first decompose the original question into a set of sub-questions using syntactic-based patterns. Then the final answers of the original question can be obtained by intersecting the answers of all subquestions. For the example question, its two subquestions are who plays anakin skywalker and who plays in star wars 1."

These methods usually take the whole question to predict the relation, which may be effected by noisy information that are unrelated to the relation, especially for those short questions.

We denote t(x) ∈ RK×1 as the target distribution vector, in which the value for gold relation is set 1, others are set 0. We compute the cross entropy error between t(x) and o(x), and further define the objective function over all training data:\nJ(θ) = − ∑ x K∑ k=1 tk(x) log ok(x) + λ||θ||2\nwhere θ is the set of model parameters to be learned, and λ is a vector of regularization parameters. The model parameters θ can be efficiently computed via back-propagation through network structures. To minimize J(θ), we apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) in our experiments."

As we know,\nentities and relations have strong selectional preferences that certain entities do not appear with certain relations and vice versa. Locally optimized models are not able to exploit these implicit bi-directional preferences. We thus exploit a ranking based joint inference model to find a globally optimal entityrelation assignment from local predictions. The key idea behind is to leverage various clues from the two local models and the KB available to rank a correct entity-relation assignment higher than those problematic ones."

      "heading" : "4.3.1 Features",
      "text" : "For a given entity-relation assignment (e, r), we exploit from the KB the following clues:\nEntity Clues The score of predicted entity e returned by the entity linking system is directly used as a feature. In addition, the mention’s text overlap with the Freebase name for entity e is also included as a feature. In Freebase, most entities have a relation fb:description that describes the basic introduction of this entity. This description serves as an important clue to distinguish the entity, since in some sense, the description could be treated as a bag of relational phrases related to this entity. For instance, in the running example, shaq is linked to three potential entities m.06 ttvh (an American reality television show), m.05n7bp (a multiplayer video game) and m.012xdf (a famous NBA basketball player). Interestingly, the relational phrase play only appears in the description of m.012xdf and occurs three times. Therefore, we count how many times the relational phrase appearing in e’s description, and include it as a feature.\nRelation Clues The score of relation r returned by the MCCNNs is used as a feature. Furthermore, we view each relation as a document which consists of the training questions that this relation is expressed in. For a given question, we use the sum of the tf-idf scores of its words with respect to the relation r as a feature.\nAnswer Clues In a natural language question, question word itself often indicates the answer type. For example, the question word when usually indicates that the answer entity has a Freebase type type.datetime. We thus use the co-occurrences of\nthe question word and the answer types as a feature. Secondly, a Freebase relation r is a concatenation of a series of fragments r = r1.r2.r3. For instance, the three fragments of people.person.parents are people, person and parents. The first two fragments indicate the Freebase type of the subject of this relation, and the third fragment indicates the object type, in our case the answer type. We use an indicator feature to denote if the surface form of third fragment r appears in the question."

Suppose that (egold, rgold) is the gold entity/relation pair for question q. Let (ea, ra) be a candidate entity-relation assignment for q. Specifically, if both ea and ra are correct (i.e., ea = egold, ra = rgold), we assign it with the highest ranking score 3. In contrast, if only the entity or relation equals to the gold one (i.e., ea = egold, ra 6= rgold or ea 6= egold, ra = rgold), we assign it with score 2. When both entity and relation assignments are wrong, we assign it with score 1. The intuition behind is that even if an assignment is not completely correct, it is still preferred than some other totally incorrect assignments. This gives the training data for our svm-ranker (Joachims, 2006), which we hope the gold-standard entity-relation assignments rank higher than incorrect ones."

If you ask someone: who did shaq first play for, and give them four candidate answers (Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Orlando Magic and Miami Heat), as well as access to Wikipedia, that person might first determine that the question is about Shaquille O’Neal, then go to O’Neal’s Wikipedia page, and search for the sentences that contain the candidate answers as\nevidences.

In the topic entity’s Wikipedia page, we utilize wikifier (Cheng and Roth, 2013) to recognize the Wikipedia entities in the sentences. Then, we collect the sentences that mention the candidate answers as the evidences, which are the input of the refinement model. For example, in the Wikipedia page of O’Neal, we can find a sentence “O’Neal was drafted by the Orlando Magic with the first overall pick in the 1992 NBA draft”, which is treated as an evidence that supports the answer Orlando Magic. This sentence is then taken into account by the refinement model to discriminate whether Orlando Magic is the answer of the question."

For each pair (q, s), we identify a set of all possible token pairs (qi, sj), the occurrences of which are used as features.

However, some of these sentences may be irrelevant to the question, we thus consider this candidate answer as correct if at least one evidence can be predicted positive by our refinement model.

The first baseline is DeepQA, which finds the answers by taking the best predictions from a pipeline of EL and RE to query the KB. The second baseline is DeepJQA, which takes the joint inference approach but without answer refinement. The third baseline is DeepRQA, which performs the answer refinement but without joint inference. Table 1 summarizes the results.\nWe can see that when adding the joint inference and answer refining step, i.e., DeepJRQA, our performance is improved by 9.2% over DeepQA, outperforming all systems including the current stateof-the-art (Yih et al., 2015). We also report Yih et al. removing its external resource ClueWeb."

      "text" : "Now let us explore the contributions of each component of our system.\nJoint inference From Table 1, we can see that adding the joint inference step make a substantial performance increase around 3%. The question of interest is how much performance gain the EL and RE components contribute during the joint inference approach.\nWe first evaluate the entity linking step with the gold entity annotation on the development set. As shown in Table 2, for 79.8% questions, our entity linker can correctly find the gold standard topic entities. We also evaluate DeepJQA to see if the joint inference helps entity linking. We see 3.4% improvement on the best prediction revealing that the joint inference is indeed beneficial. Next we use the simulated gold relations to evaluate the performance of RE component on the development set. As shown in Table 2, the relation prediction accuracy increases by 9.4% when using the joint inference approach.\nFeature variations Table 3 shows the results of feature ablation studies. In particular, we present the results using single-channel network , i.e., tuning the parameters of one channel while switching off the other. As seen, the sentence level features are found to be more important than syntactic features. This could be due to short and noisy nature of WEBQUESTIONS questions which causes the shortest dependency path inaccessible to sufficient information to predict a relation. By mixing the syntax and context channels, the joint inference model boosts its performance by 5.7% from 40.1% to 45.8%.\nAnswer refinement As shown in Table 1, when augmented with the answer refinement model, DeepRQA and DeepJRQA obtain significant performance improvements, 2.9% and 6.2%, respectively.\nOn the test set, we find 192 examples get a higher F1 value of the answers after taking the refinement method. Table 4 lists some questions and the corresponding answers of our system.\nWe manually analyze these examples and find out that, as we expected, the refinement model improves the KB-based approach mainly on 2 types of questions: (i) the questions that involve aggregation operations. Examples are Question 1-3 in Table 4. For Question 3, DeepJQA takes the Freebase relation fb:teams..from as the prediction of the joint inference approach. This relation describes the first years that ray allen joined the basketball teams including in the college and NBA. To answer such a question, the min(·) operation should be performed on these years. Note that, Ray Allen joined a college basketball team (University of Connecticut) in the 1993 rather than a NBA team. Interestingly, the refinement model can not only correctly choose the earliest year but also distinguish his basketball career period. (ii) the questions that query for fine-grained relations such as Question 4- 5 in Table 4. Take Question 5 as an example, the user queries for the college that John Steinbeck attended. However, Freebase only uses a single relation fb:education..institution to describe the person’s general education information,\nwithout discriminating the specific periods such as high school or college.\nThese empirical findings demonstrate again that it is appropriate to exploit the Wikipedia for answer refinement.\nError analysis We analyze the errors our model makes on the development set. Around 15% of the errors are caused by the incorrect entity linking. Around 50% of the errors are due to incorrect relation predictions. We analyze these relation prediction errors and find out two reasons: (i) in some short-length questions, both the dependency path and the sentence are too short to provide sufficient information to the relation classifier; (ii) the insufficiency and unbalanced distribution of the training data for the relation classifier (3022 training examples for 461 relations) heavily influences the performance of relation classification.\nThe remaining errors are due to the failure of our refinement model for two reasons. First, for some questions, we cannot find evidences with respect to the candidate answers, and our system fall back to the KB-based approach, which may obtain a collection of answers in low accuracy. Second, recall that we only use the lexical features to refine the answers, the feature sparse problem inevitably hurts the performance of our refinement model ."

      "text" : "Over time, the QA task has evolved into two main streams – QA on unstructured data, and QA on structured data. TREC QA evaluations (Voorhees and Tice, 1999) were a major boost to unstructured QA which lead to richer datasets and sophisticated methods (Wang et al., 2007; Heilman and Smith, 2010; Yao et al., 2013; Yih et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2015; Hermann et al., 2015). While initial progress on structured QA started with small toy domains like GeoQuery (Zelle and Mooney, 1996), recent focus has shifted to large scale structured KBs like Freebase, DBPedia (Unger et al., 2012; Cai and Yates, 2013; Berant et al., 2013; Kwiatkowski et al., 2013), and on noisy KBs (Banko et al., 2007; Carlson et al., 2010; Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012; Fader et al., 2013; Parikh et al., 2015). An exciting development in structured QA is to exploit multiple KBs (with different schemas)\nat the same time to answer questions jointly (Yahya et al., 2012; Fader et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016). QALD tasks and linked data initiatives are contributing to this trend.\nOur model combines the best of both worlds by inferring over structured and unstructured data. Though earlier methods exploited unstructured data for KB-QA (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012; Berant et al., 2013; Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Reddy et al., 2014; Yih et al., 2015), these methods do not rely on unstructured data at test time. Our work is closely related to Joshi et al. (2014) who aim to answer noisy telegraphic queries using both structured and unstructured data. Their work is limited in answer single relation queries.\nOur work also intersects with relation extraction methods. While these methods aim to predict a relation between two entities in order to populate KBs (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2013), we work with sentence level relation extraction for question answering. Krishnamurthy and Mitchell (2012) and Fader et al. (2014) adopt open relation extraction methods for QA but they require hand-coded grammar for parsing queries. Closest to our extraction method is (Yao and Van Durme, 2014; Yao, 2015) who also uses sentence level relation extraction for QA. Unlike them, we can predict multiple relations per question, and our MCCNN architecture is more robust to unseen contexts compared to their logistic regression models."
