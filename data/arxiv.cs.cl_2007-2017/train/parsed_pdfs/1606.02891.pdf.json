We base our im-\nplementation on the dl4mt-tutorial1 , which we enhanced with new features such as ensemble decoding and pervasive dropout.\nWe use minibatches of size 80, a maximum sentence length of 50, word embeddings of size 500, and hidden layers of size 1024. We clip the gradient norm to 1.0 (Pascanu et al., 2013). We train the models with Adadelta (Zeiler, 2012), reshuffling the training corpus between epochs. We validate the model every 10 000 minibatches via BLEU on a validation set (newstest2013, newstest2014, or half of newsdev2016 for EN↔RO). We perform early stopping for single models, and use the 4 last saved models (with models saved every 30 000 minibatches) for the ensemble results. Note that ensemble scores are the result of a single training run. Due to resource limitations, we did not train ensemble components independently, which could result in more diverse models and better ensembles.\nDecoding is performed with beam search with a beam size of 12. For some language pairs, we used the AmuNMT C++ decoder2 as a more efficient alternative to the theano implementation of the dl4mt tutorial."

BPE, originally devised as a compression algorithm (Gage, 1994), is adapted to word segmentation as follows:\nFirst, each word in the training vocabulary is represented as a sequence of characters, plus an end-of-word symbol. All characters are added to the symbol vocabulary. Then, the most frequent symbol pair is identified, and all its occurrences are merged, producing a new symbol that is added\n1https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial 2https://github.com/emjotde/amunmt 3https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt\nto the vocabulary. The previous step is repeated until a set number of merge operations have been learned.\nBPE starts from a character-level segmentation, but as we increase the number of merge operations, it becomes more and more different from a pure character-level model in that frequent character sequences, and even full words, are encoded as a single symbol. This allows for a trade-off between the size of the model vocabulary and the length of training sequences. The ordered list of merge operations, learned on the training set, can be applied to any text to segment words into subword units that are in-vocabulary in respect to the training set (except for unseen characters).\nTo increase consistency in the segmentation of the source and target text, we combine the source and target side of the training set for learning BPE. For each language pair, we learn 89 500 merge operations."

We exploit this monolingual data for training as described in (Sennrich et al., 2016a). Specifically, we sample a subset of the available target-side monolingual corpora, translate it automatically into the source side of the respective language pair, and then use this synthetic parallel data for training. For example, for EN→RO, the back-translation is performed with a RO→EN system, and vice-versa.\nSennrich et al. (2016a) motivate the use of monolingual data with domain adaptation, reducing overfitting, and better modelling of fluency. We sample monolingual data from the News Crawl corpora4, which is in-domain with respect to the test set.\nThe amount of monolingual data backtranslated for each translation direction ranges from 2 million to 10 million sentences. Statistics about the amount of parallel and synthetic training data are shown in Table 1. With dl4mt, we\n4Due to recency effects, we expect last year’s corpus to be most relevant, and sampled from News Crawl 2015 for ENRO, EN-RU and EN-CS; for EN-DE, we re-used data from (Sennrich et al., 2016a), which was randomly sampled from News Crawl 2007–2014.\nobserved a translation speed of about 200 000 sentences per day (on a single Titan X GPU)."

To mitigate this, we apply dropout to all layers in the network, including recurrent ones.\nPrevious work dropped out different units at each time step. When applied to recurrent connections, this has the downside that it impedes the information flow over long distances, and Pham et al. (2014) propose to only apply dropout to non-recurrent connections.\nInstead, we follow the approach suggested by Gal (2015), and use the same dropout mask at each time step. Our implementation differs from the recommendations by Gal (2015) in one respect: we also drop words at random, but we do so on a token level, not on a type level. In other words, if a word occurs multiple times in a sentence, we may drop out any number of its occurrences, and not just none or all.\nIn our English↔Romanian experiments, we drop out full words (both on the source and target side) with a probability of 0.1. For all other layers, the dropout probability is set to 0.2."

      "text" : "We found that during decoding, the model would occasionally assign a high probability to words based on the target context alone, ignoring the source sentence. We speculate that this is an instance of the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001).\nTo mitigate this problem, we experiment with training separate models that produce the target text from right-to-left (r2l), and re-scoring the nbest lists that are produced by the main (left-toright) models with these r2l models. Since the\nright-to-left model will see a complementary target context at each time step, we expect that the averaged probabilities will be more robust. In parallel to our experiments, this idea was published by Liu et al. (2016).\nWe increase the size of the n-best-list to 50 for the reranking experiments.\nA possible criticism of the l-r/r-l reranking approach is that the gains actually come from adding diversity to the ensemble, since we are now using two independent runs. However experiments in (Liu et al., 2016) show that a l-r/r-l reranking systems is stronger than an ensemble created from two independent l-r runs."

Using an ensemble of the last 4 checkpoints gives further improvements (1.3–1.7 BLEU). Our submission system includes reranking of the 50-best output of the left-to-right model with a right-to-left model – again an ensemble of the last 4 checkpoints – with uniform weights.

This took approximately 1M minibatches, or 3 weeks. Then we continued training the model on a new parallel corpus, comprising 8.2M sentences back-translated from the Czech monolingual news2015, 5 copies of news-commentary v11, and 9M sentences sampled from Czeng 1.6pre. The model used for back-\ntranslation was a neural MT model from earlier experiments, trained on WMT15 data. The training on this synthetic mix continued for a further 400,000 minibatches.\nThe right-left model was trained using a similar process, but with the target side of the parallel corpus reversed prior to training. The resulting model had a slightly lower BLEU score on the dev data than the standard left-right model. We can see in Table 3 that back-translation improves performance by 2.2–2.8 BLEU, and that the final system (+r2l reranking) improves by 0.7–1.0 BLEU on the ensemble of 4, and 4.3–4.9 on the baseline.\nFor Czech→English the training process was similar to the above, except that we created the synthetic training data (back-translated from samples of news2015 monolingual English) in batches of 2.5M, and so were able to observe the effect of increasing the amount of synthetic data. After training a baseline model on all the WMT16 parallel set, we continued training with a parallel corpus consisting of 2 copies of the 2.5M sentences of back-translated data, 5 copies of newscommentary v11, and a matching quantity of data sampled from Czeng 1.6pre. After training this to convergence, we restarted training from the baseline model using 5M sentences of back-translated data, 5 copies of news-commentary v11, and a matching quantity of data sampled from Czeng 1.6pre. We repeated this with 7.5M sentences from news2015 monolingual, and then with 10M sentences of news2015. The back-translations were, as for English→Czech, created with an earlier NMT model trained on WMT15 data. Our final Czech→English was an ensemble of 8 systems – the last 4 save-points of the 10M synthetic data run, and the last 4 save-points of the 7.5M run. We show this as ensemble8 in Table 3, and the +synthetic results are on the last (i.e. 10M) synthetic data run.\nWe also show in Table 4 how increasing the amount of back-translated data affects the results. We see that most of the gain from back-translation comes with the first batch, but increasing the amount of back-translated data does gradually improve performance."

We apply the Latin BPE operations to the English data (training data and input), and both the Cyrillic and Latin BPE operations to the Russian data.\nTranslation results are shown in Table 6.
