      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning aims to leverage unlabeled data to improve performance. A large number of semisupervised learning algorithms jointly optimize two training objective functions: the supervised loss over labeled data and the unsupervised loss over both labeled and unlabeled data. Graph-based semi-supervised learning defines the loss function as a weighted sum of the supervised loss over labeled instances and a graph Laplacian regularization term (Zhu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Belkin et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2012). The graph Laplacian regularization is based on the assumption that nearby nodes in a graph are likely to have the same labels. Graph Laplacian regularization is effective because it constrains the labels to be consistent with the graph structure.\nRecently developed unsupervised representation learning\nmethods learn embeddings that predict a context, e.g. a word embedding might predict nearby context words (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014), or a node embedding might predict nearby nodes in a graph (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015). In these approaches, the embeddings are jointly trained with the model parameters that predict the context from the embeddings, usually based on some variant of the softmax model. Embeddings trained with distributional information can be used to boost the performance of related tasks. For example, word embeddings trained from a language model can be applied to partof-speech tagging, chunking and named entity recognition (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015).\nIn this paper we consider not word embeddings but graph embeddings. Existing results show that graph embeddings are effective at classifying the nodes in a graph, such as user behavior prediction in a social network (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015). However, the graph embeddings are usually learned separately from the supervised task, and hence do not leverage the label information in a specific task. Hence graph embeddings are in some sense complementary to graph Laplacian regularization that does not produce useful features itself and might not be able to fully leverage the distributional information encoded in the graph structure.\nThe main highlight of our work is to incorporate embedding techniques into the graph-based semi-supervised learning setting. We propose a novel graph-based semisupervised learning framework, Planetoid (Predicting Labels And Neighbors with Embeddings Transductively Or Inductively from Data). The embedding of an instance is jointly trained to predict the class label of the instance and the context in the graph. We then concatenate the embeddings and the hidden layers of the original classifier and feed them to a softmax layer when making the prediction.\nSince the embeddings are learned based on the graph structure, the above method is transductive, which means we can only predict instances that are already observed in the graph at training time. In many cases, however, it may be desirable to have an inductive approach, where predictions\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n08 86\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n9 M\nar 2\n01 6\ncan be made on instances unobserved in the graph seen at training time. To address this issue, we further develop an inductive variant of our framework, where we define the embeddings as a parameterized function of input feature vectors; i.e., the embeddings can be viewed as hidden layers of a neural network.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments on five datasets for three tasks, including text classification, distantly supervised entity extraction, and entity classification. Our inductive method outperforms the second best inductive method by up to 18.7% and on average 7.8% in terms of accuracy. The best of our inductive and transductive methods outperforms the best of all the other compared methods by up to 8.5% and on average 4.1%.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we compare the difference between our method and previously-considered methods in semi-supervised learning and embedding learning. Section 3 describes our models, including both transductive and inductive variants. We report the experimental results in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5."

      "text" : "The main goal of semi-supervised learning is to leverage unlabeled data to improve prediction performance. Let L and U be the number of labeled and unlabeled instances. Let x1:L and xL+1:L+U denote the feature vectors of labeled and unlabeled instances respectively. The labels y1:L are also given.\nBased on both labeled and unlabeled instances, the problem of semi-supervised learning is defined as learning a classifier f : x → y. There are two learning paradigms, transductive learning and inductive learning. Transductive learning (Zhu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004) only aims to apply the classifier f on the unlabeled instances observed at training time, and the classifier does not generalize to unobserved instances. In other words, transductive learning infers the labels of unlabeled instances yL+1:L+U . For instance, transductive support vector machine (TSVM) (Joachims, 1999) maximizes the “unlabeled data margin” based on the low-density separation assumption that a good decision hyperplane lies on a sparse area of the feature space. Inductive learning (Belkin et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2012), on the other hand, aims to learn a parameterized classifier f that is generalizable to unobserved instances."

      "text" : "In addition to labeled and unlabeled instances, a graph, denoted as a (L + U) × (L + U) matrix A, is also given to graph-based semi-supervised learning methods. Each entry aij indicates the similarity between instance i and j, which can be either labeled or unlabeled. The graph A can either be derived from distances between instances (Zhu et al., 2003), or be explicitly derived from external data, such as a knowledge graph (Wijaya et al., 2013) or a citation network between documents (Ji et al., 2010). In this paper, we mainly focus on the setting that a graph is explicitly given and represents additional information not present in the feature vectors (e.g., the graph edges correspond to hyperlinks between documents, rather than distances between the bag-of-words representation of a document).\nGraph-based semi-supervised learning is based on the assumption that nearby nodes tend to have the same labels. Graph-based methods incur a penalty when nearby nodes have different labels. Generally, the loss function of graphbased semi-supervised learning in the binary case can be written as\nL∑ i=1 l(yi, f(xi)) + λ ∑ i,j aij‖f(xi)− f(xj)‖2\n= L∑ i=1 l(yi, f(xi)) + λf T∆f (1)\nIn Eq. (1), the first term is the standard supervised loss function, where l(·, ·) can be log loss, squared loss or hinge loss. The second term is the graph Laplacian regularization, which incurs a large penalty when similar nodes with a large wij are predicted to have different labels f(xi) 6= f(xj). The graph Laplacian matrix ∆ is defined as ∆ = A − D, where D is a diagonal matrix with each entry defined as dii = ∑ j aij . λ is a constant weighting factor. (Note that we omit the parameter regularization terms for simplicity.)\nVarious graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms define the loss functions as variants of Eq. (1). Label propagation (Zhu et al., 2003) forces f to agree with labeled instances y1:L; f is a label lookup table for unlabeled instances in the graph, and can be obtained with a closedform solution. Learning with local and global consistency (Zhou et al., 2004) defines l as squared loss and f as a label lookup table; it does not force f to agree with labeled instances. Modified Adsorption (MAD) (Talukdar & Crammer, 2009) is a variant of label propagation that allows prediction on labeled instances to vary and incorporates node uncertainty. Manifold regularization (Belkin et al., 2006) parameterizes f in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) with l being squared loss or hinge loss. Since f\nis a parameterized classifier, manifold regularization is inductive and can naturally handle unobserved instances.\nSemi-supervised embedding (Weston et al., 2012) extends the regularization term in Eq. (1) to be ∑ i,j aij‖g(xi) − g(xj)‖2, where g represents embeddings of instances, which can be the output labels, hidden layers or auxiliary embeddings in a neural network. By extending the regularization from f to g, this method imposes stronger constraints on a neural network.\nIterative classification algorithm (ICA) (Sen et al., 2008) uses a local classifier that takes the labels of neighbor nodes as input; since not all neighbor labels are available at the beginning, ICA uses an iterative process between estimating the local classifier and assigning new labels."

      "text" : "Extensive research was done on learning graph embeddings. A probabilistic generative model was proposed to learn node embeddings that generate the edges in a graph (Snijders & Nowicki, 1997). A clustering method (Handcock et al., 2007) was proposed to learn latent social states in a social network to predict social ties.\nMore recently, a number of embedding learning methods are based on the Skipgram model, which is a variant of the softmax model. Given an instance and its context, the objective of Skipgram is usually formulated as minimizing the log loss of predicting the context using the embedding of an instance as input features. Formally, let {(i, c)} be a set of pairs of instance i and context c, the loss function can be written as − ∑ (i,c) log p(c|i) = − ∑ (i,c) ( wTc ei − log ∑ c′∈C exp(wTc′ei) ) (2) where C is the set of all possible context, w’s are parameters of the Skipgram model, and ei is the embedding of instance i. Skipgram was first introduced to learn representations of words, known as word2vec (Mikolov et al.,\n2013). In word2vec, for each training pair (i, c), the instance i is the current word whose embedding is under estimation; the context c is each of the surrounding words of i within a fixed window size in a sentence; the context space C is the vocabulary of the corpus.\nSkipgram was later extended to learn graph embeddings. Deepwalk (Perozzi et al., 2014) uses the embedding of a node to predict the context in the graph, where the context is generated by random walk. More specifically, for each training pair (i, c), the instance i is the current node whose embedding is under estimation; the context c is each of the neighbor nodes within a fixed window size in a generated random walk sequence; the context space C is all the nodes in the graph. LINE (Tang et al., 2015) extends the model to have multiple context spaces C for modeling both first and second order proximity.\nAlthough Skipgram-like models for graphs have received much recent attention, many other models exist. TransE (Bordes et al., 2013) learns the embeddings of entities in a knowledge graph jointly with their relations. Autoencoders were used to learn graph embeddings for clustering on graphs (Tian et al., 2014)."

Semi-supervised embedding method (Weston et al., 2012) learns embeddings in a neural network, but our approach is different from this method in that instead of imposing regularization, we use the embeddings to predict the context in the graph. Graph embedding methods (Perozzi et al., 2014; Tian et al., 2014) encode the graph structure into embeddings; however, different from our approach, these meth-\nods are purely unsupervised and do not leverage label information for a specific task.

Negative sampling was proposed to address this issue (Mikolov\net al., 2013), which samples negative examples to approximate the normalization term. In our case, we are sampling (i, c, γ) from a distribution, where i and c denote instance and context respectively, γ = +1 means (i, c) is a positive pair and γ = −1 means negative. Given (i, c, γ), we minimize the cross entropy loss of classifying the pair (i, c) to a binary label γ:\n−I(γ = 1) log σ(wTc ei)− I(γ = −1) log σ(−wTc ei),\nwhere σ is the sigmoid function defined as σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x), and I(·) is an indicator function that outputs 1 when the argument is true, otherwise 0. Therefore, the loss function with negative sampling can be written as\n− E(i,c,γ) log σ(γwTc ei) (3)\nThe distribution p(i, c, γ) is conditioned on labels y1:L and the graph A. However, since they are the input to our algorithm and kept fixed, we drop the conditioning in our notation.\nWe now define the distribution p(i, c, γ) directly using a sampling process, which is illustrated in Algorithm 1. There are two types of context that are sampled in this algorithm. The first type of context is based on the graph A, which encodes the structure information, and the second type of context is based on the labels, which we use to inject label information into the embeddings. We use a parameter r1 ∈ (0, 1) to control the ratio of positive and negative samples, and use r2 ∈ (0, 1) to control the ratio of two types of context.\nWith probability r2, we sample the context based on the graph A. We first uniformly sample a random walk sequence S. More specifically, we uniformly sample the first instance S1 from the set 1 : L + U . Given the previous instance Sk−1 = i, the next instance Sk = j is sampled with probability aij/ ∑L+U j′=1 aij′ . With probability r1, we sample a positive pair (i, c) from the set {(Sj , Sk) : |j − k| < d}, where d is another parameter determining the window size. With probability (1 − r1), we uniformly corrupt the context c to sample a negative pair.\nWith probability (1− r2), we sample the context based on the class labels. Positive pairs have the same labels and negative pairs have different labels. Only labeled instances 1 : L will be sampled.\nOur random walk based sampling method is similar to Deepwalk (Perozzi et al., 2014). However, different from their method, we extend it to real-valued A, incorporate negative sampling, and explicitly sample from labels with probability (1− r2) to inject supervised information.\nAn example of sampling when γ = 1 is shown in Figure 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Sampling Context Distribution p(i, c, γ) Input: graph A, labels y1:L, parameters r1, r2, q, d Initialize triplet (i, c, γ) if random < r1 then γ ← +1 else γ ← −1 if random < r2 then\nUniformly sample a random walk S of length q Uniformly sample (Sj , Sk) with |j − k| < d i← Sj , c← Sk if γ = −1 then uniformly sample c from 1 : L+ U\nelse if γ = +1 then\nUniformly sample (i, c) with yi = yc else\nUniformly sample (i, c) with yi 6= yc end if\nend if return (i, c, γ)"

In the inductive variant, we learn a hidden layer as an embedding for predicting the graph context.\nOur experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that a) joint training gives improvement over unsupervised learning; b) predicting graph context is more effective than graph Laplacian regularization; c) the performance of the inductive variant depends on the informativeness of feature vectors. Planetoid significantly outperforms other\npreviously-considered methods on all of the considered datasets.\nOne direction of future work would be to apply our framework to more complex networks, including recurrent networks. It would also be interesting to experiment with datasets where a graph is computed based on distances between feature vectors."

Given a graph between instances, we train an embedding for each instance to jointly predict the class label and the neighborhood context in the graph. We develop both transductive and inductive variants of our method. In the transductive variant of our method, the class labels are determined by both the learned embeddings and input feature vectors, while in the inductive variant, the embeddings are defined as a parametric function of the feature vectors, so predictions can be made on instances not seen during training. On a large and diverse set of benchmark tasks, including text classification, distantly supervised entity extraction, and entity classification, we show improved performance over many of the existing models.",
