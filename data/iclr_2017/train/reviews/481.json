{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Adversarial Machine Learning at Scale", "abstract": "Adversarial examples are malicious inputs designed to fool machine learning models. They often transfer from one model to another, allowing attackers to mount black box attacks without knowledge of the target model's parameters. Adversarial training is the process of explicitly training a model on adversarial examples, in order to make it more robust to attack or to reduce its test error on clean inputs. So far, adversarial training has primarily been applied to small problems. In this research, we apply adversarial training to ImageNet. Our contributions include: (1) recommendations for how to succesfully scale adversarial training to large models and datasets, (2) the observation that adversarial training confers robustness to single-step attack methods, (3) the finding that multi-step attack methods are somewhat less transferable than single-step attack       methods, so single-step attacks are the best for mounting black-box attacks,       and (4) resolution of a ``label leaking'' effect that causes adversarially trained models to perform       better on adversarial examples than on clean examples, because the adversarial       example construction process uses the true label and the model can learn to       exploit regularities in the construction process.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper is a well written paper.

While the final conclusions are still vague, this paper raises several noteworthy finding from its experiments.\nThe paper is well written and easy to follow. Although I still have some concerns about the paper (see the comments below), this paper has good contributions and worth to publish.\n\nPros:\nFor the first time in the literature, this paper proposed the concept of \u2018label leaking\u2019. Although its effect only becomes significant when the dataset is large, it should be carefully handled in the future research works along this line.\nUsing the ratio of 'clean accuracy' over \u2018adversarial accuracy\u2019 as the measure of robust is more reasonable compared to the existing works in the literature. \n\nCons:\nAlthough the conclusions of the paper are based on the experiments on ImageNet, the title of the paper seems a little misleading. I consider Section 4 as the main contribution of the paper. Note that Section 4.3 and Section 4.4 are not specific to large-scale dataset, thus emphasizing the \u2018large-scale\u2019 in the title and in the introduction seems improper. \nBasically all the conclusions of the paper are made based on observing the experimental results. Further tests should have been performed to verify these hypotheses. Without that, the conclusions of the paper seems rushy. For example, one dataset of imageNet can not infer the conclusions for all large-scale datasets.
