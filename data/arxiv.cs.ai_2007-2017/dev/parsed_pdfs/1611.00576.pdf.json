They are very different from the usual graphs and neutrosophic graphs. Using these new structures special subgraph topological spaces are defined. Further special lattice graph of subgraphs of these graphs are defined and described. Several interesting properties using subgraphs of a strong neutrosophic graph are obtained. Several open conjectures are proposed. These new class of strong neutrosophic graphs will certainly find applications in NCMs, NRMs and NREs with appropriate modifications.\n6 These new notions are interesting and researchers can find lots of applications where neutrosophic graphs find their applications. Apart from some open conjectures several problems at research level are also suggested for the readers. We wish to acknowledge Dr. K Kandasamy for his sustained support and encouragement in the writing of this book. W.B.VASANTHA KANDASAMY ILANTHENRAL K FLORENTIN SMARANDACHE\nChapter One\nINTRODUCTION\nIn this chapter we just indicate the books which are used for the basic notions used in this book. The concept of neutrosophy can be had from [6-8]. For the basic properties about neutrosophic graphs please refer [59].\nThe basics of graph theory can be had from [1]. The main notion dealt here is the notion of subset vertex graphs. We have defined in chapter II, two types of subset vertex graphs. However for a given graph G there exists one and only one special subset vertex graph of type I but there are many special subset vertex graphs of type II for a given the set of vertices. By this method one gets several subset vertex graphs of type II. This is elaborately discussed in chapter two of this book. Several nice properties associated with them are defined, described and developed in this chapter. Next for the first time we introduce the notion of strong neutrosophic graphs.\nInfact one can say the net working of the brain is more close to strong neutrosophic graphs only. The concept of neutrosophic graphs can be had in [59] and so on. For a systematic analysis and study of neutrosophic graphs one can refer [59]. However strong neutrosophic graphs and specialty associated has been systematically studied in chapter III of this book.\n8 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\n8\nAlso associated with these graphs we define the special concept of neutrosophic complement and so on and discuss them in this chapter. Certainly we will use these new notions in several applications. These notions are very unique and will find lots of practical applications. We prove several interesting features associated with them. Infact for a given set of n-vertices we have several strong neutrosophic graphs. We see even for a graph with two vertices we have the following graphs.\nWe have infact 9 such strong neutrosophic graphs with just two vertices. Thus this new notions gives one with abundant choices. The dotted circle and dotted lines denote the graphs with indeterminate vertices and edges respectively.\nThe fourth chapter is very different and innovative. For we get the collection of subgraphs of a graph G denote it by S(G) which includes also the empty graph  we define two operation  and  and show S(G) is a topological space. Further we see these S(G) power set subgraph of the graph G always contains as a substructure a Boolean algebra of appropriate order.\nFurther we see if the neutrosophic graph is disjoint then the adjacency matrix associated with it will be a super diagonal matrix. Several interesting properties associated with them are discussed.\n v1  v2\n v1 v2 v1 v2\n v1  v2\n v1 v2 v1 v2\n  \nChapter Two\nSPECIAL SUBSET VERTEX GRAPHS\nIn this chapter authors for the first time introduce the notion of subset vertex graphs. Subset vertex graphs are of two types. One given a graph G with V = {v1, …, vn} vertex sets obtain all the subsets of this vertex set V and only get edges which are in the graph G.\nThis will be known as type I subset vertex graph. Type II subset vertex graph is a graph obtained by collecting all subsets of graphs and obtaining graphs using these subsets of vertices. Type I graph of a graph G is unique.\nHowever for type II vertex subset graph one gets many\ngraphs for the given set of vertices. First we will illustrate these situations by some examples.\nExample 2.1: Let G be the graph with only one vertex v1 and zero edges.\nWe see {v1} is a subset and {v1} is also a point subset graph,  v1.\n10 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nWhen V = {v1} we have both the graph and the subset vertex graph are identical as subset vertex graph is also .\nIt is interesting to note that in case the number of vertices is one both subset vertex graph of type I and type II are the same. Example 2.2: Let G = {{v1, v2} = V, e1} be the graph given in the following\n v1 { }\n v1  v2\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 11\nOn the other hand suppose we have V = {v1, v2} a vertex set of order two and no graph is given.\nTo find all vertex subset graphs using V. The subsets of V are {{v1, v2}, {v1}, {v2}} = SP (V).\n7G\nFigure 2.10\n {v1,v2}\n\n{v1}\n\n{v2}\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 13\nThus when no basic graph is given and we have only two vertices we can get eight different vertex subset type II graphs. We now make the following official definition. DEFINITION 2.1: Let G be a graph with n vertices and m edges. Then the vertex subset graph of type I; Gv will have 2n – 1 number of subset vertices and more than m-edges. Thus Gv will denote all subset vertex graphs of type I. We will first illustrate this situation by some examples. Example 2.3: Let G be the graph given in the following.\n14 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nThe subset vertex of G is {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}}.\nThe subset vertex graph Gv of G of type I is as follows:\nNow we proceed onto define the notion of vertex subset graphs Gi of type II, i  N.\nHowever if we are not given any graph but only the three vertices {v1, v2, v3}. Using the subsets of the vertex subsets we have the following graphs Gv of type II. DEFINITION 2.2: Let V = {v1, v2, …, vn} be n vertices where the graph is not given. Clearly using V we have 2n–1 number of subsets. Using these 2n–1 subsets we can draw the graphs Gv of type II defined as subset graphs of type II. When n = 1 we have only one subset vertex graph of type II. When n = 2 we have 8 subset vertex graphs of type II given by v1G , v2G , …, v8G .\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 15\nInfact we leave it as a open conjecture to find the number of subset vertex graphs Gv of type II when we have n vertices.\nWe see the number of subset vertex graphs Gv of type II. When n = 3, V = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}}.\nand so on.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 17\nThere are how many subset vertex graphs of type II? This a open conjecture. Number of subset vertex graphs of type II having two edges with only one edge adjacent to each vertex.\nand so on.\nand so on.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 19\nv t r sG  \n {v1}\n {v2}\n {v3}\n {v1,v2}  {v1,v3}  {v2,v3}\n {v1,v2,v3}\n20 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … and so on.\nand so on.\nand so on.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 21\nand so on.\n22 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nand so on. We can have 7 edges, 8 edges, 9 edges and so on. Now this study leads to the following conjectures. Conjecture 2.1: Let V = {v1, v2, v3} be the set of vertices. SP(V) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}} be the vertex subsets of type II. How many distinct subset vertex graphs of type II can be constructed using SP(V)? Conjecture 2.2: Let V = {v1, v2, …, vn} be the subset vertex graph of type II. How many distinct subset vertex graphs of type II can be constructed using SP(V)? Conjecture 2.3: How many one edge subset vertex graphs of type II can be constructed using 2n–1 subset vertices.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 23\nConjecture 2.4: How many two edge subset vertex graphs of type II can be constructed using 2n–1 subset vertices? Conjecture 2.5: How many three edge subset vertex graphs of type II can be got using 2n – 1 subset vertices? Conjecture 2.6: How many r edge subset vertex graphs of type II can be got using these 2n – 1 subset vertices. Conjecture 2.7: Give the maximum number of edges that can be had for the subset vertex graphs of type II using 2n – 1 subset vertices. Example 2.4: Let V = {v1, v2, v3} be the vertices.\nSP(V) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}} be the subset of vertices.\nTo find the maximum number of edges the subset vertex\ngraph of type II can be got from\n24 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nHowever we can say the maximum number of edges adjacent to any of the subset vertex of a n number of vertices.\nV = {v1, v2, …, vn} have 2n–2 edges for a subset vertex graph of type II. SP(V) = 2n–1. The natural question is; can we have meaningful subset vertex graph type II trees?\nFor this first we have to fix the root. We always as a convention fix the whole set V = {v1, v2, …, vn} as the root. We will represent this by the following examples. Example 2.5: Let V = {v1, v2, v3} be the vertices.\nSP(V) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}} be the subset vertices of V. There can be many subset vertex trees of type II which will be described in the following.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 25\n26 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nHow many distinct meaningful subset vertex trees of type II can be constructed using\nSP(V) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1,v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}} where o(V) = 3?\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 27\nIf V = {v1, v2, …, vn} find the number of subset vertex trees of type II using SP(V). Using SP(V) of V = {v1, v2, …, vn}, how many complete subset vertex graph of type II can be obtained?\nNext we proceed onto find the subset vertex graph of type I of a graph G which is a tree. Example 2.6: Let G be the tree graph given in the following.\nV = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} be the vertices of the tree. S(P(V)) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v4}, {v5}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v1, v4}, {v1, v5}, {v2, v3}, {v2, v4}, {v2, v5}, {v3, v4}, {v3, v5}, {v4, v5}, {v1, v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v4}, {v1, v2, v5}, {v1, v3, v5}, {v1, v3, v4}, {v1, v4, v5}, {v2, v3, v4}, {v2, v3, v5}, {v2, v4, v5}, {v3, v4, v5}, {v1, v2, v3, v4}, {v1, v2, v3, v5}, {v1, v2, v4, v5}, {v1, v3, v4, v5}, {v2, v3, v4, v5}, {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5}}.\n28 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nHowever the graph is not complete. But infact it is very complicated. However the subset vertex graph Gv of type I is not a subset\nvertex graph tree even if the given graph G is a tree.\nWe find the vertex subset graph (tree) of type I. Gv is as follows:\nHowever one finds it difficult to get trees using subset vertices leading to graph Gv of type I.\n30 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nBut if {v1, v2, …, vn} are n vertices one can easily get many subset vertex tree of type II; Gv.\nThis is the main advantage of using type II subset vertex\ngraph Gv. Let V = {v1, v2, v3} be the vertex set.\nS(P(V)) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v3}}.\nThe following graph v1G is a tree of type II.\nAlready different graphs of type II tree are discussed. Next we proceed onto use the set of vertices. V = {v1, v2, v3, v4}. S(P(V)) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v4}, {v1, v2}, {v1, v3}, {v1, v4}, {v2, v3}, {v2, v4}, {v3, v4}, {v1, v2, v3}, {v1, v2, v4}, {v1, v3, v4}, {v2, v3, v4}, {v1, v2, v3, v4}}.\nThe following is one of the subset vertex tree of type II.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 31\nV = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5}, SP(V)) = {{v1}, {v2}, {v3}, {v4}, {v5}, {v1,v5}, {v1,v2}, {v1,v3}, {v1,v4}, {v2,v3}, {v2,v4}, {v2,v5},\n32 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … {v3,v4}, {v3,v5}, {v4,v5}, {v1,v2,v3},{v1,v2,v4}, {v1,v2,v5}, {v1,v3,v4}, {v1,v5,v3}, {v1,v4,v5}, {v2,v3,v4}, {v2,v3,v5}, {v2,v4,v5}, {v3,v4,v5}, {v1,v2,v3, v4}, {v1,v2,v3, v5}, {v1,v2,v4, v5}, {v1,v3,v4, v5}, {v2,v3,v4, v5}, {v1,v2,v3,v4, v5}} is a subset vertex set.\nWe give the subset vertex graph of type II which is tree is as\nfollows:\nThis is tree of type II. Infact we can get several such trees of type II.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 33\nSo for practical problems finding any suitable tree depending on the problem is at the choice of the researcher. For instance even preferable subsets can be selected from SP(V).\nThis is illustrated by the following example.\nFor from a full collection a restricted collection can be taken and the goal is reached and getting the subset vertex tree. This is the way essential subset vertex tree of type II is carried out. However one of the factors is can we the notion of merged graphs in case of subset vertex graphs of both type I and type II.\nHere we do merging not of the whole subset vertex graph but only subgraphs of the graphs.\nTo this end we first proceed onto study the subgraphs of subset vertex graphs of type I and type II.\n34 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nIt is infact important to keep on record that these subgraphs may be just graphs in some cases and in most cases subset vertex subgraphs of type I or type II according as Gv or Gv is taken. First we will illustrate this situation by some examples. Example 2.8: Let Gv be the vertex subset graph of type I of the graph G given by the following figure. G =\n {v3}\n {v5}\n {v4}\n {v1}\n {v2}\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 35\n36 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nEach subset vertex is adjacent with 8 of the vertices. We next describe the vertex subset subgraph of Gv.\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 37\nEach of the subset vertex has different sets of edges adjacent to it.\nThe vertex set {v1, v2, v3, v4} has six edges adjacent to it. The vertex {v2, v3, v4} has only four edges adjacent to it. Clearly the vertex {v1} and {v2} have only three edges adjacent to it.\nNext the vertex {v3, v4} is also important for 5 edges are adjacent to it. Next consider the vertex subset subgraph with vertices {v3} {v2, v1} and {v4, v5};\n38 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nSpecial Subset Vertex Graphs 39\nWe try to merge these subset vertex trees. M1 =\nFigure 2.58\nWe see the merged graph of P1 and P2 is not a tree.\nWe call this the meshed tree for we get a very different structure which is not a tree. Consider\nis again a subset vertex tree.\n {v3}\n {v1,v2,v3,v4}\n {v1}\n {v2}\n {v1,v4,v5}\n {v2,v4}\n40 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Let\nT2 =\nWe merge both T1 and T2 M2\nFigure 2.61 This is not a tree not even a meshed tree. So M1 and M2 are distinctly different.\n {v5}\n {v4,v3,v2}\n {v2}  {v1}\n {v3,v4}\nChapter Three\nSTRONG NEUTROSOPHIC GRAPHS In this chapter we define yet a new class of graphs called strong neutrosophic graphs. The notion of neutrosophic graphs was recently introduced by the authors in [59]. In case of neutrosophic graphs we had the vertices to be real and not indeterminates. But in case of strong neutrosophic graphs we take some of the vertices to be also indeterminates that is neutrosophic.\nWe now proceed onto define the notion of strong neutrosophic graphs. DEFINITION 3.1: Let G = (V, E) be a graph with n number of vertices V = {v1, v2, …, vn} where k of the vertices are real and n–k of the vertices are neutrosophic or indeterminates (k  1); t of the edges are usual and p–t of the edges are neutrosophic (t  1). We define the graph G = (V, E) to be the strong neutrosophic graph.\n42 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … We will illustrate this situation by some examples. Example 3.1: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nClearly denotes the neutrosophic vertex and denotes the usual vertex. We know denotes usual edge and\ndenotes the neutrosophic edge.\n\nG9 and G12 are complements of each other cannot be called as strong neutrosophic graphs.\n44 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.3: We see G = (V, K), V = {v0, v1} and K = {e}.\nWe see we have 6 different graphs with two vertices and one edge. Example 3.4: Let us consider G = {V, E} where V = {v0, v1, v2, v3} and E = {e0, e2, e1, e3} G1 G2   v0 v1 e0   v3 v2 e2 e1 e3   v0 v1  v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 45\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n v0 v1\n v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n  v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n  v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n  v3 v2\n  v0 v1\n v3 v2\n46 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\n v3 v2\nv0 v1\nv3 v2\n  v0 v1\n  v3 v2\nExample 3.5: Let us consider the graphs which are all types not connected and planar with four vertices.

Find the total number of complete graphs which are usual, pure neutrosophic, neutrosophic, strong neutrosophic semistrong edge neutrosophic and semistrong vertex neutrosophic.\nii. How many graphs are strong neutrosophic? iii. How many graphs are neutrosophic? iv. Find the number of graphs which are semi strong edge neutrosophic. v. Find the number of graphs which are semi\nstrong vertex neutrosophic.\nWe give some example of strong neutrosophic trees and adjoint strong neutrosophic graphs. Example 3.6: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is disjoint.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 55\nExample 3.7: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n56 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.9: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n \n  \n  \nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 57\nClearly G is disjoint.\n58 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.14: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nNow we see by introducing the indeterminate vertices and indeterminate edges we get many graphs. We get six strong graphs with two vertices and one edge.\n   \nWhen some one works with a problem be it scientific or medical or social it is natural we at times are not in the position to spell about a vertex in such cases these graphs will play a vital role. For instance in a social problem we many think about the existence of a node or not.\nFor if we are interested in studying the students problems among the concepts his performance is an indeterminate if the teacher is a partial teacher, many a times the node is indeterminate. The concept of indeterminate vertex will be vital in case of network. Even our brain cell at times keeps certain nodes to be indeterminate while associating them. So if we try to give the map by a graph we have the only appropriate graph is the strong neutrosophic graph. All most all the working of the brain is only in the form of graphs for any sort of it only strong neutrosophic graphs can serve the real purpose. For all the\n60 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … stimulai of the brain cannot and do not act simultaneously, several of them are in the indeterminate state only. Thus authors feel, be it neutral networks or artificial intelligence it is strong neutrosophic graphs which is going to play a vital role. For we are in the popular computer age where we view brain = computer (Kosko).\nAs rightly said by Kosko “We shall explore machine intelligence from a dynamical systems view point brain = dynamical system.” Thus it is doubly confirmed brain can be appropriately described only by strong neutrosophic graphs where at a given time for a particular problem or situation the brain synapse may be a usual graph or a neutrosophic graph or a strong neutrosophic graph. All the while we have been only working using a usual graph. It is time to get sensitive results, one needs to work with neutrosophic graphs [59] and strong neutrosophic graphs.\nWe have already used the concepts of neutrosophic graphs in NCMs, NRMs and NREs[25, 26]. We are yet to use the concept of strong neutrosophic graphs. Soon we shall construct many such in due course of time. Now we see yet other type of neutrosophic graphs. We may have the following type of graphs.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 61\nThus this may so happen in case all the vertices are indeterminate at one time. This graph will be called or defined as only vertex strong neutrosophic graph. Example 3.16: Consider H =\nFigure 3.19\nH is a pure neutrosophic graph. Clearly H is not strong neutrosophic graph as none of its vertices are neutrosophic. We further observe that H is the quasi strong complement of G and G is the complement of H.\n     \n62 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.17: Let G be the strong neutrosophic graph G = The strong complement of G is H =\nFigure 3.20 Clearly H and G are quasi strong complements. Infact G has no quasi strong complements.\nExample 3.18: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph the complement of G is H which is as follows: G =\nFigure 3.21 Now the strong complement of H is as follows:\n  \n  \nExample 3.19: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows.\n64 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Clearly H is a strong neutrosophic graph. Example 3.20: Let G be a strong edge neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nLet H be the strong complement of the neutrosophic graph H which is as follows:\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 65\nWe see both G and H are neither neutrosophic nor strong neutrosophic graphs. For we see in G all the edges are real but some vertices are neutrosophic and some vertices are real. Similarly we see H is neither neutrosophic nor a strong neutrosophic graph. However G is the complement of H and vice versa. We call the graphs of this type as quasi strong vertices neutrosophic graph G and H as quasi strong pure neutrosophic edge graphs. We have several types of graphs which are illustrated. G1 G2 G3        \nG2 is also neither neutrosophic nor pure neutrosophic or a strong neutrosophic graph.\nG3 is pure neutrosophic. G5 is strong neutrosophic. G4 is also not neutrosophic or strong neutrosophic nor pure neutrosophic. G6 is strong pure neutrosophic. Thus some of them are quasi strong vertex (edge) neutrosophic.

Example 3.26: Let G be strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n72 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nWe see G and H are identical. Thus G is a self complemented strong neutrosophic graph.\nExample 3.27: Let G be a strong complemented graph which is as follows:\nClearly G is a self complement strong neutrosophic graph. Now we define a new notion. DEFINITION 3.2: Let G be a neutrosophic graph. We have H the neutrosophic complement of G. We define quasi vertex\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 73\nstrong neutrosophic complement of G in which all the vertices are indeterminate. We will show this by some examples. Example 3.28: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is as follows: The complement H of G is as follows:\nFigure 3.43\n \n \n\n74 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Clearly K is not a strong neutrosophic graph. Example 3.29: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is follows:\nClearly H is not a strong neutrosophic graph.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 75\nWe see for a given neutrosophic graph we can have two distinct complements. Example 3.30: Let G be a pure neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nHowever the strong neutrosophic complement P of G is as follows:\n76 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 77\nClearly K is not a strong neutrosophic graph. We see the complement of the usual graph is a pure strong doubly neutrosophic graph.\nWe see the pure strong doubly neutrosophic graph is not in the class of strong neutrosophic graph. We see G is a usual graph. G =\nFigure 3.53\n\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n \n\n\n  \n78 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … The neutrosophic graph H is as follows: H =\nFigure 3.54\nClearly H is a pure neutrosophic graph. Now we find the strong neutrosophic complement K of graph G which is as follows: K =\nFigure 3.55\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  \nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 79\nWe see K is not a strong neutrosophic pure graph. We see under complements we cannot at all times accept the graph is in the collection.\nSo to this end we define super strong neutrosophic graphs which contains the usual graph, pure neutrosophic graph semi strong vertex neutrosophic graph and semi strong edge neutrosophic graph.\nThis for a given number of points and edges is analysed.\nFor a given number of vertices and given number of edges we have one and only one usual graph and one and only one pure neutrosophic graph and one, only one semi strong vertex neutrosophic graph, one and only graph which semi strong edge neutrosophic graph and finally one and only pure strong neutrosophic graph.\nHowever we have several neutrosophic graphs and several strong neutrosophic graph. We will first illustrate this situation by some examples. G =\nFigure 3.56\nG is a usual graph.\n     \nLet G3 be the semi strong neutrosophic vertex graph which is as follows: G3\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 81\nG4 G5 G6 G7 G8 G9\nG10 G11\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n82 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … G12 G13 G14 G15 G16 G17\nG18 G19\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 83\nG20 G21 G22\n  \n\n\nG1 G2 G3\n    \nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 85\nG4 G5 G6\n     \nS1 is a usual subgraph, S3 is a pure neutrosophic subgraph, S5 is not strong neutrosophic subgraph, S4 is a strong neutrosophic subgraph and S5 is not a strong neutrosophic subgraph. Thus S1, S2, …, S5 belong to the class of super strong\nneutrosophic graphs.\nExample 3.35: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph. The subgraphs of G need not be a strong neutrosophic subgraphs. However subgraphs of G is in the class of super strong neutrosophic subgraphs. We want to illustrate this by some examples. Example 3.36: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 87\nWe see this strong neutrosophic graphs has subgraphs which are not strong neutrosophic graphs. S1 S2\n v3\n  v5 v6\nv4\nv8 v7\n88 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nOf the four subgraphs only S4 is a strong neutrosophic graph.\nS1 is a usual graph. S2 is a pure neutrosophic graph. S3 is a neutrosophic graph. S3 has no neutrosophic vertices. So we see the subgraphs general need not enjoy the properties of the graph. So when we build structures on the collection of all subgraphs we accept this and make the class a larger one. We can define connected path and walk in case of strong neutrosophic graphs also. We will illustrate this situation by some examples.\nLet G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows: We define a strong neutrosophic walk is defined as a finite alternating sequence of vertices and edges which some of the vertices must be neutrosophic and some must necessarily be neutrosophic edges. In a neutrosophic walk we have a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices are real and necessarily some of the edges are neutrosophic. We will illustrate both the situations before we proceed to define more concepts in strong neutrosophic graphs. Example 3.37: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 89\nA walk is v1 e1 v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 e4 v5 e5 v6 e6 v7 e7 v8 e8 is a strong neutrosophic walk. v6 e6 v7 e7 is a strong neutrosophic walk. v4e4v5 is only a neutrosophic walk not a strong neutrosophic walk. v8 e10 v10 e11 v11 is a usual walk.\nThus a strong neutrosophic graph can have all types of graph. Example 3.38: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n90 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nWe see this strong neutrosophic graph has all types of types. v0 e0 v1 e1 v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 e4 v5 is a usual walk. v10 e10 v11 e11 v0 e0 v1 is a strong neutrosophic walk. v7 e7 v8 e8 v9 e9 v10 e10 is a pure strong neutrosophic graph. This strong neutrosophic graph has no neutrosophic walk. Example 3.39: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 91\nv9 e9 v1 e1 v2 e2 v3 is a neutrosophic walk. v3 e3 v4 e4 v5 e5 v6 e6 v7 e7 v8 is a strong neutrosophic graph. Thus we have seen all types of walks is a strong neutrosophic graph. A open walk in which no vertex appears more than once is a path. We all several types of paths.\nInfact we have as many as number of distinct walks as distinct paths. We will illustrate this by some examples.\n92 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.40: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nConsider p1 - v17 e17 v0 e0 v1 e1 v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 .\np1 is a open strong neutrosophic walk and hence a open strong neutrosophic path. Consider p2 : v5 e5 v6 is a pure strong neutrosophic open walk hence p2 is a pure strong neutrosophic path. Let p3 : v8 e8 v9 e9 v10; p3 is a open usual walk which is also a usual path. Let p4 : v11 e11 v12 e12 v13 e13 v14 e14 v15 is a open neutrosophic walk which is also a neutrosophic path.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 93\nExample 3.41: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which also follows:\nLet p1 : v0 e0 v1 e1 v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 is a open neutrosophic walk which is also a neutrosophic path. Clearly p1 is not a strong neutrosophic(open walk) path. Consider p2 : v4 e4 v5 v6 e6 v7 e7 v8 e8 v9 is a open strong neutrosophic walk which is also a strong neutrosophic path. Consider p3 : v1 e1 v2 is also a open usual walk hence the usual path. Let p4 : v8 e8 v9 is a pure neutrosophic open walk which is a pure neutrosophic path.\n94 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … The number of edges correspond to the length of a path.\nIn case of both neutrosophic and strong neutrosophic path we have some edges to be usual and some edges to be neutrosophic.\nSuppose we have n edges in a strong neutrosophic graph or a neutrosophic graph then certainly we must have n = s + t where s  1 and t  1 with s corresponding to neutrosophic edges and t corresponding to the usual edges. In case of pure neutrosophic path or strong pure neutrosophic path of length n we have all the n-edges to be neutrosophic. We will first illustrate this by some examples. Example 3.42: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nLength of the path is four.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 95\nLet p2 : v10 e10 v11 e11 v12, p2 is a strong neutrosophic path or a strong neutrosophic open walk two e10 is real and e11 is neutrosphic. p3 : v8 e7 v7 e6 v6 e5 v5 is a neutrosophic path or neutrosophic open walk of length three of which two edges are reals and one edge is neutrosophic. Let p4 : v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 be a strong pure neutrosophic path or a pure neutrosophic open walk of length two both the edges are neutrosophic.\nRecall a closed walk in which no vertex repeats is a circuit. We have four types of circuits.\nWe will describe this by some examples. Example 3.43: Let G be a strong neutrosophic path\nFigure 3.72\np1 : v0 e1 v1 e2 v2 e3 v0  v5  v6  v4  v7  v2  v1\n v0  v8  v9  v10  v13  v12  v11  v16  v17  v15  v18 e6 e5 e4 e1 e2 e3 e8 e9 e10 e13 e12 e8 e11 e16 e17 e18 e15 e14 e7 e19\np2 : v8 e9 v9 e10 e11 v11 e12 v12 e13 v13 e8 p2 is a circuit which is a strong neutrosophic circuit.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 97\np4 is a pure neutrosophic circuit. p4 : v15 e15 v16 e16 v17 e17 v18 e18 v15. Example 3.44: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graphs which is as follows:\nWe see G has no proper circuits.\nThe only circuit is G itself which is a strong neutrosophic circuit.\n98 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 3.45: Let G be a strong neutrosophic path.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 99\nClearly G has no neutrosophic circuit. Thus we see a given strong neutrosophic graph can in general need not have all the four types of circuits. Example 3.46: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows.\n100 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … a pure neutrosophic circuit p1 : v7 e8 v5 e6 v6 e7 v7 p2 : v2 e2 v3 e3 v4 e4 v2 be a usual circuit which is as follows:\np3 : v9 e11 v0 e0 v1 e1 v2 e12 v9 be a strong neutrosophic circuit which is as follows:\nClearly this graph has no neutrosophic circuit.\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 101\nExample 3.47 : Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph.\nThis strong neutrosophic graph has no circuits. Example 3.48: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n102 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … We can have several examples unicursal pure neutrosophic graphs and neutrosophic graphs also exist.

These graphs can be used in strong Neutrosophic Relational Models and Strong Neutrosophic Relation Equations. Example 3.52: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nStrong Neutrosophic Graphs 105\nWe call a strong neutrosophic graph as k-neutrosophic partite if the vertex set {v1, …, vn} is partitioned into k subsets that no vertices joints in subsets and each of the sets contain either only real vertices or only neutrosophic vertices, that is thee is no mixed vertices in the subsets. We will illustrate this situation by some examples. Example 3.54: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nClearly G is a strong 5-partite neutrosophic graph. Example 3.55: Let G be a strong neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n106 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nThus from these two graphs one easily sees the difference.

S(G) has a lattice structure with o(S(G)) points and the lattice of S(G) denoted by LS(G) contains a Boolean algebra of order 2n or if X = {v1, …, vn} then P(X)  S(G). This proof is also direct hence left as an exercise to the reader. Now we see this power subgraph set has several interesting properties which we enlist in the following as results. S(G) denotes the power subgraph set of a graph G. Result 4.1: G is the greatest element of S(G) and  is the least element of G.

Result 4.7:  is the complement of G.\nThe following questions are of interest and are listed as open problems. Problem 4.1: Given G is a graph with n vertices and p edges. Find the cardinality of S(G). Problem 4.2: Can the lattice associated with S(G) be distributive? Example 4.10: Let G be a graph given below.\n \n\nv3 v2\nv1\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 127\nExample 4.11: Let G be the graph\nFigure 4.26\nS(G) denote the collection of all subgraphs of G.\nv1  v2  v5  v3  v4 \n128 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … If H1 = is a subgraph of G\nFigure 4.27\nwe see S(H1)  S(G). H2 =\na subgraph of G.\nS(H3)  S(G) and we see as special lattice subgraphs we see S(H3)  S(H1). We have several properties about subgraphs as special sublattice subgraphs.

One can have the special lattice subgraphs of S(G). H = is a subgraph of G. Now S(H) = {Collection of all subgraphs of H with H and }\nS(H) is a Boolean algebra of order four. Example 4.13: Let G =\nv1 \nv2 \n130 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nS(G) = {, , , , , , , …,\n, …,\nand so on}. Now we see S(G) is closed under ‘’ and ‘’.\nNow S(G) can be given a topological we call S(G) as the special topology subgraphs of a graph.\nGiven any graph G we define S(G) as the special topological subgraphs. Thus even if vertices are same and edges are different we get distinct graphs. We get for a given set of n-vertices we have many special topological subgraphs depending on the edges. Study of these new class of topologies using subgraphs happens to be one of the innovations both on graph theory and topologies. It is left as an open problem which is as follows. Problem 4.3: Let G be a graph with n vertices. If G has p edges what is S(G)? If G has m edges what is S(G) (p>m)? Compare them. Example 4.14: Let G be the graph\nFigure 4.33\n v1 { }  v2 { }  v3 { }  v4 { }  v1 { } v2  v5 { }\n v4 { }  v5\n v2\n v4  v5\n v3  v1  v2\n v4  v5\n v1  v2  v3  v4\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 131\nand H be the graph.\n v1  v2  v3  v4\n132 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … , , . o(SG) = 25.\nWe see S(H)  S(G). Thus a graph with 4 vertices and two edges has 25 subgraphs and a graph H with 4 vertices and one edge has 20 subgraphs.\nThus addition of edges gives more subgraphs. Further if we have only 4 vertices graph K the S(K) will have 24 = 16 subgraphs. We see the special topological subgraphs depend on the number of edges of the graph. THEOREM 4.5: All special lattice of graphs G are Smarandache lattices where G has more then or equal to two vertices. Proof follows from the simple fact if G as a graph with n vertices. The special lattice of subgraphs associated with S(G) has a sublattice which is a Boolean algebra of order 2n (n  2). Hence these lattices are Smarandache lattices. It is important to notice that each subgraph of the graph G can be associated with a special graph topological space. By this way we get a class of new special topological subgraph spaces which is very different from the usual topological spaces on subsets of a set. Now if G has finite number of vertices certainly the special subgraph topological spaces are finite.\n v1 { }  v2  v3  v4  v1 { }  v2  v3  v4\n v1 { }  v2  v3  v4  v1 { }  v2  v3  v4\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 133\nFurther depending on the graph the special topological subgraph spaces will be different. It is left for the reader to study the special topological subgraph spaces of a connected graph, tree, Turan graph, Wagner graph, k-partile graph and stars. However we illustrate for a few of them the rest is left as an exercise to the reader. Example 4.15: Let G be the Turan graph.\nWe call the special topological subgraph space as the Turan special topological subgraph space or special Turan topological subgraph spaces.\n134 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 4.16: Let G be a graph\nThe subgraphs of G denoted by S(G) = {, G, , , , , , , … }.

Now we proceed on to discuss about neutrosophic graphs G and the S(G) associated with them. It is pertinent to mention here if G is a pure neutrosophic graph then S(G) of it is the same as that of the usual graph G where the neutrosophic edges are replaced by usual edges. The difference occurs only when some of the edges are neutrosophic and other are ordinary or usual edges.\nWe will proceed onto illustrate them. Let = G be the usual graph and H =\nFigure 4.39 Figure 4.40\na neutrosophic graph S(G)  S(H) both as lattice graph as well as special topological subgraph. Take G to be and\n v1  v2  \n v1  v2\n v0\ngraphs. Also as topologies they are different.\nFor if we want to speak of isomorphic graphs by no means we agree to map a usual edge to a\nFigure 4.44\nneutrosophic edge.\nHence we see we cannot treat them as identical. Example 4.19: Let us consider a graph with 3 vertices.\nand so on. So we see we have 2 neutrosophic complete graphs with 3 vertices and only one pure neutrosophic graph.\n   \nwe see S(G)  S(K) or S(K) or S(K). However S(K)  S(K)  S(K). We see if T is the pure neutrosophic graph\nFigure 4.48\nwe see S(T)  S(K) or S(G). Thus we have by defining neutrosophic graphs for the complete graph with three vertices we have three neutrosophic graphs all of them different. and\nFigure 4.49\n v1  v2\n v0\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 139\nNow if we have a complete graph with four vertices planar how many distinct neutrosophic graphs do we get from them.

We just propose some interesting problems. Problem 4.4: Can a neutrosophic graph G with n neutrosophic edges and p usual edges p  n be a self complemented neutrosophic graph?\n150 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Problem 4.5: Is it true a graph with n vertices which has equal number of usual edges and neutrosophic edges be a self complemented neutrosophic graph? Example 4.28: Let G be a neutrosophic graph\nRecall from Frank Harary if G is a graph, it can also be considered as a symmetric reflexive relation on a finite set of p points.\nThis relation is called adjacency and it can be represented by a p  p binary matrix A = [aij]. In A, the ith row and column correspond to the ith point vi, with aij = 1 if vi and vj are adjacent and aij = 0 otherwise. This is called the adjacency matrix of a graph and there is clearly a one to one correspondence between labeled graphs with p points and p by p symmetric binary matrices with zero diagonal. Now let G be a neutrosophic graph. Then the adjacency matrix associated with G will be a neutrosophic matrix if vi and vj are neutrosphically adjacent then aij = I\nA = 0 I 1 1 I 0 1 I 1 1 0 I 1 I I 0             .\nClearly A is a symmetric neutrosophic matrix. Example 4.30: Let G be a neutrosophic graph.\nv2\n152 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … The neutrosophic adjacency matrix A of G is as follows:\nA = 0 1 I I 1 1 0 1 I 1 I 1 0 1 I I I 1 0 1 0 1 I 1 0                .\nSuppose G is the neutrosophic graph.\nThe neutrosophic adjacency matrix, A associated with is;\nA = 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 I 0 0 0 I 0 1 1 0 0 1 0                .\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 153\nExample 4.31: Let G be a neutrosophic matrix which is as follows:\nA = 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 I 0 0 0 I 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 I 1 0 0 I 0                .\nIt is interesting to note if the neutrosophic matrix associated with a neutrosophic graph which has only one edge to be neutrosophic and the rest are all usual then the neutrosophic adjacency matrix A will have only two entries as I and all other entries will be 0 and 1. Another observation is if G is a neutrosophic graph with only two neutrosophic edges then the associated neutrosophic adjacency matrix with have only 4 entries to be I’s and the rest 0’s or 1’s. In view of this we have the following theorem the proof of which is direct and hence left as an exercise to the reader. THEOREM 4.6: Let G be a neutrosophic graph. G has only one neutrosophic edge if and only if the neutrosophic adjancency matrix A of G has two neutrosophic entries and the rest are 0’s and 1’s.\n154 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … We give the generalized result in the following theorem. THEOREM 4.7: Let G be neutrosophic graph. G has s edges to be neutrosophic if and only if the adjacency neutrosophic matrix A associated with G has 2s neutrosophic entries (ie. A has totally 2s entries which are I) and the rest of the entries of A are either 0 or 1. This proof is also direct and hence left as an exercise to the reader.\nWe have the result of usual graph to be true in case of neutrosophic graphs also. THEOREM 4.8: A neutrosophic graph G is disconnected if for some labeling the neutrosophic adjacency matrix A can be partitioned into neutrosophic submatrices A11, A12, A21 and A22 where A11 and A22 are square neutrosophic matrices.\n       11 22 A 0 0 A\nWe will proceed onto give some more examples before we proceed to give analogous theorems.

The only advantage is we can several neutrosophic graphs but only one usual graph with the number of edges and vertices remaining fixed. We will illustrate this situation by some examples. Example 4.43: Let G be the neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nThe adjacency matrix A of G is as follows:\nA =\n0 1 2 3 4\n0 1 2 3 4 v v v v v v 0 1 0 0 0 v 1 0 I 0 I v 0 I 0 1 1 v 0 0 1 0 1 v 0 I 1 1 0                ,\n172 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nA2 = 1 0 I 0 I 0 1 2I I 2I I I I 2 I 1 1 I 0 2I 1 2 1 I 1 1 I 1 2 I                 .\nClearly v0 has only one edge passing through it.\nThe vertex v1 has two neutrosophic edges and one usual edge that is why the second diagonal term is 1 + 2I. The vertex v2 has 2 ordinary edges and one neutrosophic edge passing thro’ it that is why the term is 2+I. The edges thro’ the vertex are two ordinary edges.\nFinally the edges thro’ v4 are two ordinary edges and one neutrosophic edge. Example 4.44: Let G be a neutrosophic graph given as follows:\nThe adjacency neutrosophic matrix A associated with G is as follows:\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 173\nA =\n0 1 2 3\n0 1 2 3 v v v v v 0 1 I 0 v 1 0 1 1 v I 1 0 I v 0 1 I 0             .\nWe find A2;\nA2 = 1 I I 1 1 I I 3 2I I 1 2I 2I 1 1\n1 I I 1 1 I              .\nNow A3 =\n2I 3 2I 5I 2I 3 2I 4I 3 2I 3 2I\n5I 2I 3 4I 5I 2I 3 2I 5I 2I             .\nWe see Y = A + A2 + A3\n= 1 3I 4 3I 6I 1 1 3I 4 3I 3 4I 4 4I 4 3I 1 6I 4I 4 6I 1 6I 1 1 3I 3I 4 6I 1 1 3I                       .\nNo term in Y is zero proving the neutrosophic graph G is connected.\nNow we proceed onto find the Y of a disconnected neutrosophic graph.\n174 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Example 4.45: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\n v0  v1\n v2\n v3  v4\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 175\nFor the vertices v3 and v4 we have the diagonal elements to\nbe I confirming that only one neutrosophic edge bridges them.

THEOREM 4.12: Let G be a neutrosophic graph with n vertices. Let A be the neutrosophic adjacency matrix of the graph G. Let Y = A + A2 + A3 + … + An–1 then G is disconnected if and only if there exists at least one entry in the matrix Y that is zero. THEOREM 4.13: Let G be a neutrosophic graph. A the neutrosophic adjacency matrix of G.\nThen An is also symmetric for any n. That is to prove product of a symmetric matrix with itself is symmetric. Now we introduce a few simple notions about neutrosophic graphs. In the first place given the number of vertices and edges we can have several neutrosophic graphs which are different. For instance we have given two vertices there exists one and only one neutrosophic graph which is also pure that is\n v0  v1  v0  v1\nIt is an open problem to find for a given graph G with n vertices and p edges the total number of neutrosophic graphs with p edges and n vertices. Example 4.46: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nWe have several subgraphs which are not neutrosophic sum\nsubgraphs which are pure neutrosophic. Some subgraphs which are neutrosophic.\nWe just give them.\n178 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph …\nWe see there is only one usual subgraphs which is large in the since all other usual subgraphs of G are only subgraphs of H we call this H as the largest usual subgraph of G. Now we find all pure neutrosophic subgraphs of G.\nand so on.\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 179\nWe see P is the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph of G. All other pure neutrosophic subgraphs of G are subgraphs of P. Infact P is disjoint. However H is connected.\nWe call P the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph of G.\nConsider the neutrosophic subgraphs of G.\nare all usual subgraphs of G. The smallest pure neutrosophic graph is of the form\nFigure 4.100 and the smallest neutrosophic graph is of the form\n \nExample 4.47: Let G be a neutrosophic graph given in the following.\nand so on.\nand so on.\nOf course all vertices amount for small usual graphs. Now we proceed onto present the largest pure neutrosophic\n182 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … The largest pure neutrosophic subgraph is as follows:\nClearly the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph is not connected and has four components. The usual largest subgraph is also not connected and has two components. We define the following concepts. If a connected neutrosophic graph G has both the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph as well the largest usual subgraph are disconnected we call G to be pseudo strongly disconnected largest neutrosophic graph. If a connected neutrosophic graph G has both the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph as well as the largest usual subgraph are connected we call G to be strongly connected graph. If in a connected graph G which is neutrosophic only one of the largest subgraph is connected other is disconnected then we call G to be just connected. Suppose we have a neutrosophic graph G and it is a component of two graphs that is G is disconnected and one fo the subgraph is connected neutrosophic and other subgraph is connected usual then we call G to be special disconnected strong neutrosophic graph. We will give examples of them.\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 183\nExample 4.48: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nFigure 4.109\n v0  v8\n v9\n v6\n v7  v5\n v4\n v1\n v2\n v3\n184 Strong Neutrosophic Graphs and Subgraph … Clearly G is connected however both pure neutrosophic largest subgraph as well as largest usual subgraph of G are not connected. Example 4.50: Let G be a neutrosophic graph which is as follows:\nG is disconnected and both the largest pure neutrosophic subgraph as well as largest usual subgraph of G are disconnected. THEOREM 4.14: Let G be the disconnected neutrosophic graph with atleast H1 and H2 (G = H1  H2) where both H1 and H2 are connected and neutrosophic. Then G has both largest pure neutrosophic subgraph as well as largest usual graph to be disconnected. Proof is left as an exercise to the reader. THEOREM 4.15: Let G be a neutrosophic graph. The smallest usual subgraphs of G are vertices and the smallest pure neutrosophic subgraphs of G are\nFigure 4.111 The proof is direct and hence is left as an exercise to the reader.\n vi  vj\nSpecial Subgraph Topological Spaces 185\nFind conditions on G so that the largest subgraphs are always disconnected.
