      "text" : "In multilabel classification the learner is given an example and is asked to output a subset of the labels that are relevant for that example. Multilabel problems come up often in web applications where data of interest may be tagged with zero or more tags representing, for example, the objects in an image, the topics of a news story, or the relevant hashtags of a tweet. A simple approach to multilabel prediction is to learn one classifier per label and predict each label independently. Why should we expect that we can improve upon this procedure? One answer is because in many real world multilabel problems the labels are correlated. A blog post about cooking has a higher chance of also being related to nutrition than to finance.\nIn this paper we propose a simple and efficient technique for multilabel classification that we call calibration. Given a random variable y, a prediction p is calibrated with respect to y if E[y|p] = p. For binary classification, several calibration algorithms have been proposed Platt et al. (1999); Zadrozny and Elkan (2001); Kakade et al. (2011) and they all work by learning a link function that transforms the outputs of generic classifiers to calibrated probability estimates. Unlike binary classification where calibration has been well studied Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana (2005),\ncalibration procedures for multilabel and multiclass problems, where the link function must map vectors to vectors, have received little attention. As calibration in the sense of E[y|p] = p is generally computationally hard in high dimensions Hazan and Kakade (2012), for the rest of the paper we use the term calibration to only mean that we are learning a link function that jointly maps vectors to vectors. This simple idea is a surprisingly effective way to deal with multilabel (and multiclass) problems. Going back to the example of a blog post about cooking and nutrition, we want to have a second stage of learning where the prediction of the cooking classifier and the nutrition classifier can mutually reinforce one another.\nConcretely, we will motivate our approach by introducing a flexible link function and a straightforward algorithm for obtaining a multilabel classifier. We then present two crucial ideas: performing principal component analysis (PCA) on the outputs of the classifiers is well suited to multilabel data, and a creative way to perform randomized PCA (RPCA) on those outputs. Using these ideas we arrive at our final algorithm which avoids fitting individual classifiers and scales to very large output spaces, yet it is equivalent to the straightforward algorithm when the outputs of the individual classifiers are replaced by their projections onto their principal components.\nOur techniques naturally extend to multiclass classification which is just a special case of multilabel prediction where exactly one of the labels needs to be output. To illustrate this our experiments include both multilabel and multiclass data. As we expect to improve upon simple approaches for multilabel prediction because labels are correlated, in the multiclass setting we expect our approach to be fruitful when the posterior probabilities of many classes are correlated. This tends to be true for many large scale multiclass problems: in practice it is difficult to be interested in thousands of completely different concepts.\nIn the rest of the paper we overview a randomized algorithm for PCA (Section 2), we introduce our technique as fitting a flexible link function (Section 3), and we argue that statistical (Section 4) and computational (Section 5) improvements are possible if we use RPCA on the the inputs to the link function. We present related work on Section 6 and experiments on Section 7."

The algorithm is insensitive to the parameters ℓ and q as long as they are large enough (in our experiments we use ℓ = 20 and q = 1). We start with a set of k + ℓ random vectors and use them to probe the range of X⊤X . Since principal eigenvectors can be thought as “frequent directions” (Liberty, 2013), the range of Ψ will tend to align fairly with the space spanned by the top eigenvectors of X⊤X . We compute an orthogonal basis for the range of Ψ and refine it by repeating q times. This can also be thought as orthogonal (aka subspace) iteration for finding eigenvectors with early stopping (i.e., q is small). Afterwards we use our approximation of the principal subspace of X⊤X to optimize fully over that subspace (lines 7 and 8) and back out the solution (line 9). These last few steps are cheap because we are only working with a (k + ℓ) × (k + ℓ) matrix and the largest bottleneck is either the computation of Ψ or the orthogonalization step. To run the algorithm observe that X or X⊤X need not be available explicitly; all we need is to compute the action of X⊤X on a given Q."

      "heading" : "3 From Link Functions to Calibration",
      "text" : "We begin with the premise that in many multilabel problems certain label combinations frequently co-occur. We would like to take advantage of such co-occurrence patterns, but we cannot jump directly into modeling the output space because the classifier can only reach that space through the features it uses. Therefore, we will try to model correlations among the predictions. The simplest way to do this is to introduce a link function as an operator that maps a vector of activations p to a vector of predictions ŷ = Cp. A very popular operator in the setting of multiclass classification is the softmax: g(p) = ∇ log ∑ i exp(pi). This is an oblivious operator whose effect is to boost the largest activation while ensuring the predictions form a probability distribution. In multilabel classification, we would like to introduce a non-oblivious operator, because we do not know a priori which labels frequently occur together.\nA first possibility is a linear operator i.e. C is a c × c matrix. A natural choice in\nthis case is\nC = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nyiy ⊤ i\nand with g0(p) = Cp we see that the link function is taking a weighted combination of training labels weighted by the inner product between the activation and each label. Though intuitive, this link function does not do much: the predictions are a fixed linear transformation of the activations with no adjustable parameters. This can be easily fixed by introducing a non-negative scalar αi for each label:\ng1(p) = ∑ αiyiy ⊤ i p, (1)\nso that labels with a large αi influence the prediction more towards themselves. This link function is now evidently a linear kernel machine with α playing the role of dual variables. Our next step is to generalize the link function by replacing the inner product in input space with a kernel function, an inner product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space:\ng2(p) = ∑ αiyiK(yi, p) (2)\nOur final observation to motivate the connection between link functions and calibration is to consider the effect of approximating the kernel function with a finite sum of basis elements. There are several techniques for doing this, including the Nyström method Williams and Seeger (2001), Incomplete Cholesky Factorization Fine and Scheinberg (2002), and Random Fourier Features (RFFs) Rahimi and Recht (2007). Here we will use RFFs which are especially easy to work with shift invariant kernels (i.e. K(y, p) = κ(y− p)) and have the advantage that they can be generated in an oblivious way, without knowing how the activations p look like. This will prove important for the efficiency of the final algorithm.\nAlthough it is not yet obvious, for our final algorithm we believe (and present some empirical justification) that shift-invariant kernels are broadly applicable in this context, as we are not using kernels in the feature space. Rather, we are applying kernels to the activations (and, later, to projected activations), which are low-dimensional dense vectors for which a smoothness prior is appropriate.\nRecall that for shift invariant kernels\nK(y, p) ∝ E(r,b)∼q×U(0,2π) cos(r ⊤y + b) cos(r⊤p+ b)\nwhere the distribution q depends on the kernel and U(a, b) is the uniform distribution in (a, b). Therefore we can approximate g2 by\ng3(p) =\nn∑\ni=1\nαiyi 1\ns\ns∑\nj=1\ncos(r⊤j yi + bj) cos(r ⊤ j p+ bj)\nWe now replace 1 s ∑n i=1 αiyi cos(r ⊤ j yi+ bj) by optimization variables vj and arrive at\ng(p) def =\ns∑\nj=1\nvj cos(r ⊤ j p+ bj)\nAlgorithm 2 Naive Calibration 1: Input: x, y 2: Fit independent binary classifiers: pij = fj(xi) 3: Draw random vectors rt and biases bt t = 1, . . . , s 4: Featurize activations φt(xi) = cos(r⊤t f(xi) + bt) 5: Learn weight matrix V\nV = argmin V ∈Rs×c loss(Y,Φ(X)V )\nWe call the procedure of estimating the parameters vj calibration because it learns a link function similar to calibration techniques for binary classification including Platt scaling Platt et al. (1999) and isotonic regression Zadrozny and Elkan (2001). We reiterate that, unlike isotonic regression for binary classification, we cannot guarantee that g(p) is calibrated in the sense of E[y|g(p)] = g(p) because of hardness results Hazan and Kakade (2012) when y is high dimensional. Under some hard to verify conditions, specialized algorithms Agarwal et al. (2013) can yield a truly calibrated g(p) and these algorithms essentially perform many rounds of our procedure. In this work, however, we use a single stage of calibration which substantially simplifies the algorithm of Agarwal et al. (2013) and, as we will show later, already provides empirically superior performance over many strong baselines.\nAt this point we have the two-stage procedure outlined in Algorithm 2. The loss function in the final fit can be either independent logistic regressions or least squares. The former usually requires a smaller s to attain the same result, while the latter admits a fast fitting procedure Vincent (2014) that is independent of the size of the output as long as the output is sparse. As we argue in the next sections, Algorithm 2 is actually quite wasteful both statistically and computationally. In the following sections we will heal these problems using randomized PCA techniques."

      "text" : "Though we started with assuming that certain combinations of labels (and activations) are more correlated than others we have not yet clarified what is the exact property we will be exploiting. Correlations between activations are captured in their empirical second moment and our assumption is that this matrix is low rank and therefore can be described by k ≪ c eigenvectors:\nÊ[pp⊤] def =\n1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\npip ⊤ i =\nk∑\ni=1\nλiuiu ⊤ i .\nEmpirically we have found this assumption to hold for many multilabel problems. Furthermore, similar ideas, such as assuming that the second moment of the labels is low rank, have been employed in other techniques for multilabel problems Tai and Lin (2012). The key benefit of using activations instead of labels is that our proposed\nmethod applies equally well to multiclass problems whereas the method of Tai and Lin (2012) would yield trivial results in the multiclass setting.\nHow can the procedure outlined in Algorithm 2 be improved by taking advantage of the fact that activations are low rank? When activations are nominally in Rc but really only span a smaller subspace of dimension k then the kernel approximation employed in lines 3 and 4 or Algorithm 2 is very wasteful. To illustrate this point we will, for simplicity, focus on kernels that are not only shift invariant, but also rotationally invariant: K(p, p′) = κ(||p − p′||2). If p, p′ only span a space of dimension k then there exists a k × c matrix U⊤ such that ||p− p′||2 = ||U⊤p− U⊤p′||2. Moreover the matrix U is given by the top k eigenvectors of Ê[pp⊤]. We can therefore reduce the dimensionality of the activations p with PCA before applying our kernel approximation. This reduces the variance, or, alternatively, requires drawing fewer random vectors to achieve the same level of approximation.\nSince each feature function is now computing cos(r⊤t U ⊤p+ b) the random vectors that we use to project the activations are now Urt with rt ∈ Rk. Furthermore, their covariance is equal to UΣU⊤ with Σ ∈ Rk×k being the covariance of the sampling distribution for rt (typically a multiple the identity). On the other hand, Bochner’s theorem tells us that there’s a one to one mapping from sampling distributions to positive definite shift invariant kernels. Therefore, projecting the activations onto the principal components is implicitly tuning the kernel to the observed data."

      "text" : "There are three computational issues with the algorithm as proposed thus far. First we need to fit individual classifiers for each problem which can be very time consuming if the number of labels c is large. Second, when c is large forming the empirical second moment of the activations and computing the top eigenvectors might be infeasible. Third, the final optimization over the matrix V still requires the solution of a large number of problems. Here we address all of them.\nWe start with the issue of fitting the s × c matrix V . One possibility is to treat each of the columns of V in parallel as each of them can be learned independently: by this stage we have finished modeling dependencies among labels. For square loss we can alternatively use the recent technique of Vincent (2014) that shows how to perform stochastic gradient updates for least squares problems when the output is large but sparse. This method only requires O(s2) computation instead of O(sc) where s is the number of calibration functions (i.e., cosines) we use.\nWe tackle the other two issues together. Our key observation is that in order to run the algorithm we only need to have the projections of the activations onto their principal components. Surprisingly, for the case of linear classifiers (and kernel machines), it is possible to obtain these without fitting all individual classifiers and forming the second moment of the activations. Our procedure implicitly performs randomized PCA Halko et al. (2011) on the predictions without ever fitting individual classifiers.\nRecall that to perform RPCA on a matrix A, all that is required is to be able to compute AΩ for any given Ω. We focus on executing RPCA on the activations when\nthey are the result of a least squares fit with a linear classifier1. In this case we have that the matrix of activations satisfies:\nP = X(X⊤X)−1X⊤Y\nand the empirical second moment is\n1 n P⊤P = 1 n Y ⊤X(X⊤X)−1X⊤Y.\nTherefore to computeP⊤PΩ for a givenΩ we just need to computeZ∗ = (X⊤X)−1X⊤Y Ω and then form Y ⊤XZ∗. Now, notice that we can express Z∗ as\nZ∗ = argmin Z ||Y Ω−XZ||2F .\nThus we only need to solve k + 20 least squares problems to simulate the execution of (one iteration of) RPCA on the activations of c independent classifiers fitted with least squares.2 This can be substantially smaller than c the dimensionality of Y . Moreover, Y is sparse so the cost of forming Y Ω does not depend on c either.\nOnce we obtain U , the top k eigenvectors of P⊤P from RPCA we then find W ∗ = argminW ||Y U −XW || 2 F which allows us to compute the projection of the activations on the principal components since"

      "text" : "Algorithm 3 puts the above ingredients together. A few remarks are in order: For simplicity, we have specified k as a parameter but RPCA can also incorporate a strategy for increasing k if initial estimates of the captured variance are too low. To improve generalization performance, we use a regularized least squares fit for the RPCA solves. Regularization is less crucial (and sometimes detrimental) for learning the final V matrix, but this is not surprising given the correspondence between label embeddings and low-rank regularization Mineiro and Karampatziakis (2014).\nAnother (implicit) parameter of the algorithm is the sampling distribution of the vectors rt. This distribution defines the choice of shift invariant kernel we will be using to measure similarities between activations p and labels y. Fortunately, we can offer some guidance here using the spectral properties of various shift-invariant kernels (see also Le et al. (2013) for details). We recommend using Gaussian and Cauchy respectively for low and high dimensional y. These are special cases of the multivariate Student distribution with ν = ∞ and ν = 1 degrees of freedom. Intermediate values such as ν = 3 and ν = 5 can offer better results for medium dimensional y. The corresponding kernels are from the Matérn family. Some empirical support for their superiority on medium to high dimensional vectors is offered in Le et al. (2013).\n1These arguments can be extended to the case of kernel machines. 2 In our experiments we run the loop in RPCA for one iteration and in general 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 is recom-\nmended.\nAlgorithm 3 Calibration via Randomized PCA 1: Input: X,Y, k 2: (ℓ, q) ← (20, 1) 3: Q ← randn(c, k + ℓ) 4: for i ∈ {1, . . . , q} do 5: Z ← argminZ∈Rd×(k+ℓ) ‖Y Q−XZ‖ 2 F\n6: Q ← orthogonalize(Y ⊤XZ) 7: end for 8: F ← (Y ⊤XQ)⊤(Y ⊤XQ) 9: (Ũ ,Σ2) ← eig(F, k)\n10: U ← QŨ 11: W = argminW∈Rd×k ||Y U −XW || 2 F 12: Draw random vectors rt and biases bt t = 1, . . . , s 13: Featurize projected predictions\nφt(xi) = cos(r ⊤ t Wxi + bt)\n14: Learn weight matrix V = argmin\nV ∈Rs×c loss(Y,Φ(X)V ) (3)"

(2011) have focused on binary classification and they are now widely used in applications together with diagnostic tools such as calibration plots. Calibration for multiclass and multilabel classification has received little empirical attention. A notable exception for multiclass is Zadrozny and Elkan (2002) which first produces calibrated probability estimates for induced binary problems and then combines these estimates to a final estimate of the posterior probability of each class. However, it is not clear how well calibrated the final multiclass estimates are. In high dimensions, given hardness results Hazan and Kakade (2012) and a lack of diagnostic tools, our approach follows a more pragmatic route: select a family of flexible link functions via a kernel machine parameterization, then learn an efficient approximation to a good link function in that family using random features.\nExploitation of the low-rank structure of predictions via dimensionality reduction is a popular technique in the multilabel literature. Hsu et al. (2009), motivated by advances in compressed sensing, utilized a random embedding of the labels along with sparse decoding strategy. Bengio et al. (2010) combined a tree based decomposition with a low-dimensional label embedding. For the multilabel case, the principal label space transform (PLST) Tai and Lin (2012) constructs a low-dimensional embedding using principal components on the empirical label covariance, which is then utilized along with a greedy sparse decoding strategy.\nThe conditional principal label space transformation (CPLST), another dimension-\nality reduction approaches to multilabel classification, has strong connections to our technique. In particular (Chen and Lin, 2012) initially SVD the same matrix as in algorithm 3, denoted here as Y ⊤XZ∗, albeit without leveraging randomized techniques and without exploiting the specialization of randomized PCA to this context. The similarities are intriguing given that CPLST is motivated by a bound on Hamming loss. However, CPLST solves an optimization problem which is designed to make an independent decode strategy effective, and apply kernelization to the feature space; whereas we learn a decoder and apply kernelization to the decoding problem, i.e., predictions. Our experimental finding of broad applicability of shift-invariant kernels is plausibly attributable to the shared statistical structure of multilabel problems encountered in practice, as opposed to the diverse statistical structure of features, e.g., sparse highcardinality text vs. dense low-cardinality images. In other words, the choice of kernel in our procedure is greatly simplified.\nTree-based approaches are the other major category of multilabel learning algorithms. Due to the richness of the literature, we refer the reader to a survey paper Cerri et al. (2014). Here we discuss FastXML Prabhu and Varma (2014), an multilabel tree ensemble method for which we have direct experimental comparisons. FastXML makes several design choices to mitigate the computational expense of applying decision trees to high label cardinality (aka extreme) multilabel problems. In particular, FastXML partitions the feature space, in contrast to some approaches that partition the label space. Furthermore, FastXML also avoids solving an expensive label assignment problem at each node by using the union of the labels encountered in the training set (ordered by empirical frequency). This yields state of the art performance on multiple datasets when using a precision-at-k metric."

Since we have a two stage procedure with non-linear features at the second step, could it be the case that we could have just obtained the same results by a much simpler method? Here we illustrate that simple methods such as blindly using a kernel (approximation) directly to the inputs and predicting the labels independently produce very different results than our judicious use of flexibility to model inter-label dependencies.\nWe focus on the RCV1 industries dataset that has a small training set, compared to its fairly larger number of features. Based on this, we should expect that naive application of flexible modeling can lead to decreased generalization performance. Indeed, we performed three experiments: learn individual logistic regressions to predict each\nof the 354 categories, learn individual kernel logistic regressions with a Gaussian kernel approximation (the bandwidth was selected as in the previous experiments), and our calibration procedure with a final least squares fit on Gaussian kernel approximation.
