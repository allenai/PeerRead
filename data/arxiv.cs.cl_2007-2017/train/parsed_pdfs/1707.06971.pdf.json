      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Several sentence rewriting operations have been extensively discussed in the literature: sentence compression, multi-sentence fusion, sentence paraphrasing and sentence simplification.\nSentence compression rewrites an input sentence into a shorter paraphrase (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Cohn and Lapata, 2008; Filippova and\n1The Split-and-Rephrase dataset is available here: https://github.com/shashiongithub/ Split-and-Rephrase.\nStrube, 2008; Pitler, 2010; Filippova et al., 2015; Toutanova et al., 2016). Sentence fusion consists of combining two or more sentences with overlapping information content, preserving common information and deleting irrelevant details (McKeown et al., 2010; Filippova, 2010; Thadani and McKeown, 2013). Sentence paraphrasing aims to rewrite a sentence while preserving its meaning (Dras, 1999; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Wubben et al., 2010; Mallinson et al., 2017). Finally, sentence (or text) simplification aims to produce a text that is easier to understand (Siddharthan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Narayan and Gardent, 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Narayan and Gardent, 2016; Zhang and Lapata, 2017). Because the vocabulary used, the length of the sentences and the syntactic structures occurring in a text are all factors known to affect readability, simplification systems mostly focus on modelling three main text rewriting operations: simplifying paraphrasing, sentence splitting and deletion.\nWe propose a new sentence simplification task, which we dub Split-and-Rephrase, where the goal is to split a complex input sentence into shorter sentences while preserving meaning. In that task, the emphasis is on sentence splitting and rephrasing. There is no deletion and no lexical or phrasal simplification but the systems must learn to split complex sentences into shorter ones and to make the syntactic transformations required by the split (e.g., turn a relative clause into a main clause). Table 1 summarises the similarities and differences between the five sentence rewriting tasks.\nLike sentence simplification, splitting-andrephrasing could benefit both natural language processing and societal applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP systems, it could be used as a preprocess-\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n06 97\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\ning step which facilitates and improves the performance of parsers (Tomita, 1985; Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; McDonald and Nivre, 2011; Jelı́nek, 2014), semantic role labelers (Vickrey and Koller, 2008) and statistical machine translation (SMT) systems (Chandrasekar et al., 1996). In addition, because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter ones, it should also be of use for people with reading disabilities (Inui et al., 2003) such as aphasia patients (Carroll et al., 1999), low-literacy readers (Watanabe et al., 2009), language learners (Siddharthan, 2002) and children (De Belder and Moens, 2010).\nContributions. We make two main contributions towards the development of Split-andRephrase systems.\nOur first contribution consists in creating and making available a benchmark for training and testing Split-and-Rephrase systems. This benchmark (WEBSPLIT) differs from the corpora used to train sentence paraphrasing, simplification, compression or fusion models in three main ways.\nFirst, it contains a high number of splits and rephrasings. This is because (i) each complex sentence is mapped to a rephrasing consisting of at least two sentences and (ii) as noted above, splitting a sentence into two usually imposes a syntactic rephrasing (e.g., transforming a relative clause or a subordinate into a main clause).\nSecond, the corpus has a vocabulary of 3,311 word forms for a little over 1 million training items which reduces sparse data issues and facilitates learning. This is in stark contrast to the relatively small size corpora with very large vocabularies used for simplification (cf. Section 2).\nThird, complex sentences and their rephrasings are systematically associated with a meaning representation which can be used to guide learn-\ning. This allows for the learning of semanticallyinformed models (cf. Section 5).\nOur second contribution is to provide five models to understand the difficulty of the proposed Split-and-Rephrase task: (i) A basic encoderdecoder taking as input only the complex sentence; (ii) A hybrid probabilistic-SMT model taking as input a deep semantic representation (Discourse representation structures, Kamp 1981) of the complex sentence produced by Boxer (Curran et al., 2007); (iii) A multi-source encoderdecoder taking as input both the complex sentence and the corresponding set of RDF (Resource Description Format) triples; (iv,v) Two partition-andgenerate approaches which first, partition the semantics (set of RDF triples) of the complex sentence into smaller units and then generate a text for each RDF subset in that partition. One model is multi-source and takes the input complex sentence into account when generating while the other does not."

      "text" : "We briefly review previous work on sentence splitting and rephrasing.\nSentence Splitting. Of the four sentence rewriting tasks (paraphrasing, fusion, compression and simplification) mentioned above, only sentence simplification involves sentence splitting. Most simplification methods learn a statistical model (Zhu et al., 2010; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Narayan and Gardent, 2014) from the parallel dataset of complex-simplified sentences derived by Zhu et al. (2010) from Simple English Wikipedia2 and the traditional one3.\nFor training Split-and-Rephrase models, this dataset is arguably ill suited as it consists of 108,016 complex and 114,924 simplified sentences thereby yielding an average number of simple sentences per complex sentence of 1.06. Indeed, Narayan and Gardent (2014) report that only 6.1% of the complex sentences are in fact split in the corresponding simplification. A more detailed evaluation of the dataset by Xu et al. (2015) further shows that (i) for a large number of pairs, the\n2Simple English Wikipedia (http://simple. wikipedia.org) is a corpus of simple texts targeting “children and adults who are learning English Language” and whose authors are requested to “use easy words and short sentences”.\n3English Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org).\nsimplifications are in fact not simpler than the input sentence, (ii) automatic alignments resulted in incorrect complex-simplified pairs and (iii) models trained on this dataset generalised poorly to other text genres. Xu et al. (2015) therefore propose a new dataset, Newsela, which consists of 1,130 news articles each rewritten in four different ways to match 5 different levels of simplicity. By pairing each sentence in that dataset with the corresponding sentences from simpler levels (and ignoring pairs of contiguous levels to avoid sentence pairs that are too similar to each other), it is possible to create a corpus consisting of 96,414 distinct complex and 97,135 simplified sentences. Here again however, the proportion of splits is very low.\nAs we shall see in Section 3.3, the new dataset we propose differs from both the Newsela and the Wikipedia simplification corpus, in that it contains a high number of splits. In average, this new dataset associates 4.99 simple sentences with each complex sentence.\nRephrasing. Sentence compression, sentence fusion, sentence paraphrasing and sentence simplification all involve rephrasing.\nParaphrasing approaches include bootstrapping approaches which start from slotted templates (e.g.,“X is the author of Y”) and seed (e.g.,“X = Jack Kerouac, Y = “On the Road””) to iteratively learn new templates from the seeds and new seeds from the new templates (Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002; Duclaye et al., 2003); systems which extract paraphrase patterns from large monolingual corpora and use them to rewrite an input text (Duboue and Chu-Carroll, 2006; Narayan et al., 2016); statistical machine translation (SMT) based systems which learn paraphrases from monolingual parallel (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Zhao et al., 2008), comparable (Quirk et al., 2004) or bilingual parallel (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Ganitkevitch et al., 2011) corpora; and a recent neural machine translation (NMT) based system which learns paraphrases from bilingual parallel corpora (Mallinson et al., 2017).\nIn sentence simplification approaches, rephrasing is performed either by a machine translation (Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Narayan and Gardent, 2014; Xu et al., 2016; Zhang and Lapata, 2017) or by a probabilistic model (Zhu et al., 2010; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011). Other approaches include symbolic approaches where hand-crafted rules are used e.g., to\nsplit coordinated and subordinated sentences into several, simpler clauses (Chandrasekar and Srinivas, 1997; Siddharthan, 2002; Canning, 2002; Siddharthan, 2010, 2011) and lexical rephrasing rules are induced from the Wikipedia simplification corpus (Siddharthan and Mandya, 2014).\nMost sentence compression approaches focus on deleting words (the words appearing in the compression are words occurring in the input) and therefore only perform limited paraphrasing. As noted by Pitler (2010) and Toutanova et al. (2016) however, the ability to paraphrase is key for the development of abstractive summarisation systems since summaries written by humans often rephrase the original content using paraphrases or synonyms or alternative syntactic constructions. Recent proposals by Rush et al. (2015) and Bingel and Søgaard (2016) address this issue. Rush et al. (2015) proposed a neural model for abstractive compression and summarisation, and Bingel and Søgaard (2016) proposed a structured approach to text simplification which jointly predicts possible compressions and paraphrases.\nNone of these approaches requires that the input be split into shorter sentences so that both the corpora used, and the models learned, fail to adequately account for the various types of specific rephrasings occurring when a complex sentence is split into several shorter sentences.\nFinally, sentence fusion does induce rephrasing as one sentence is produced out of several. However, research in that field is still hampered by the small size of datasets for the task, and the difficulty of generating one (Daume III and Marcu, 2004). Thus, the dataset of Thadani and McKeown (2013) only consists of 1,858 fusion instances of which 873 have two inputs, 569 have three and 416 have four. This is arguably not enough for learning a general Split-and-Rephrase model.\nIn sum, while work on sentence rewriting has made some contributions towards learning to split and/or to rephrase, the interaction between these two subtasks have never been extensively studied nor are there any corpora available that would support the development of models that can both split and rephrase. In what follows, we introduce such a benchmark and present some baseline models which provide some interesting insights on how to address the Split-and-Rephrase problem."

(2017).\n3.1 The WEBNLG Dataset\nIn the WEBNLG dataset, each item consists of a set of RDF triples (M ) and one or more texts (Ti) verbalising those triples.\nAn RDF (Resource Description Format) triple is a triple of the form subject|property|object where the subject is a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), the property is a binary relation and the object is either a URI or a literal value such as a string, a date or a number.

      "text" : "To construct the Split-and-Rephrase dataset, we make use of the fact that the WEBNLG dataset (i) associates texts with sets of RDF triples and (ii) contains texts of different lengths and complexity corresponding to different subsets of RDF triples. The idea is the following. Given a WEBNLG MRText pair of the form (M,T ) where T is a single complex sentence, we search the WEBNLG dataset for a set {(M1, T1), . . . , (Mn, Tn)} such that {M1, . . . ,Mn} is a partition of M and 〈T1, . . . , Tn〉 forms a text with more than one sentence. To achieve this, we proceed in three main steps as follows.\nSentence segmentation We first preprocess all 13,308 distinct verbalisations contained in the WEBNLG corpus using the Stanford CoreNLP\n4We use a version from February 2017 given to us by the authors. A more recent version is available here: http://talc1.loria.fr/webnlg/stories/ challenge.html.\npipeline (Manning et al., 2014) to segment each verbalisation Ti into sentences.\nSentence segmentation allows us to associate each text T in the WEBNLG corpus with the number of sentences it contains. This is needed to identify complex sentences with no split (the input to the Split-and-Rephrase task) and to know how many sentences are associated with a given set of RDF triples (e.g., 2 triples may be realised by a single sentence or by two). As the CoreNLP sentence segmentation often fails on complex/rare named entities thereby producing unwarranted splits, we verified the sentence segmentations produced by the CoreNLP sentence segmentation module for each WEBNLG verbalisation and manually corrected the incorrect ones.\nPairing Using the semantic information given by WEBNLG RDF triples and the information about the number of sentences present in a WEBNLG text produced by the sentence segmentation step, we produce all items of the form 〈(MC , C), {(M1, T1) . . . (Mn, Tn)}〉 such that:\n• C is a single sentence with semantics MC .\n• T1 . . . Tn is a sequence of texts that contains at least two sentences.\n• The disjoint union of the semantics M1 . . .Mn of the texts T1 . . . Tn is the same as the semantics MC of the complex sentence C. That is, MC =M1 ⊎ . . . ⊎ Mn.\nThis pairing is made easy by the semantic information contained in the WEBNLG corpus and includes two subprocesses depending on whether complex and split sentences come from the same WEBNLG entry or not.\nWithin entries. Given a set of RDF triplesMC , a WEBNLG entry will usually contain several alternative verbalisations for MC (e.g., T 11 and T 2 1 in Figure 1 are two possible verbalisations of M1). We first search for entries where one verbalisation TC consists of a single sentence and another verbalisation T contains more than one sentence. For such cases, we create an entry of the form 〈(MC , TC), {(MC , T )}〉 such that, TC is a single sentence and T is a text consisting of more than one sentence. The second example item for WEBSPLIT in Figure 1 presents this case. It uses different verbalisations (T 11 and T 2 1 ) of the same meaning representation M1 in WEBNLG to construct\na WEBSPLIT item associating the complex sentence (T 11 ) with a text (T 2 1 ) made of three short sentences. Across entries. Next we create 〈(M,C), {(M1, T1) . . . (Mn, Tn)}〉 entries by searching for all WEBNLG texts C consisting of a single sentence. For each such text, we create all possible partitions of its semantics MC and for each partition, we search the WEBNLG corpus for matching entries i.e., for a set S of (Mi, Ti) pairs such that (i) the disjoint union of the semantics Mi in S is equal to MC and (ii) the resulting set of texts contains more than one sentence. The first example item for WEBSPLIT in Figure 1 is a case in point. C(= T 11 ) is the single, complex sentence whose meaning is represented by the three triples M . 〈T2, T3〉 is the sequence of shorter texts C is mapped to. And the semantics M2 and M3 of these two texts forms a partition over M .\nOrdering. For each item 〈(MC , C), {(M1, T1) . . . (Mn, Tn)}〉 produced in the preceding step, we determine an order on T1 . . . Tn as follows. We observed that the\nWEBNLG texts mostly5 follow the order in which the RDF triples are presented. Since this order corresponds to a left-to-right depth-first traversal of the RDF tree, we use this order to order the sentences in the Ti texts."

In this paper, we proposed to approach this problem in a supervised setting where we aim to maximise the likelihood of T given C and model parameters θ: P (T |C; θ).

They first use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to convert a source sequence to a dense, fixed-length vector representation (encoder). They then use another recurrent network (decoder) to convert that vector to a target sequence.\nWe use a three-layered encoder-decoder model with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)) units for the Splitand-Rephrase task. Our decoder also uses the local-p attention model with feed input as in (Luong et al., 2015). It has been shown that the local attention model works better than the standard global attention model of Bahdanau et al. (2014). We train this model (SEQ2SEQ) to predict, given a complex sentence, the corresponding sequence of shorter sentences.\nThe SEQ2SEQ model is learned on pairs 〈C, T 〉 of complex sentences and the corresponding text.

For instance, an input containing a path (X|P1|Y )(Y |P2|Z) equating the object of a property P1 with the subject of a property P2 may favour a verbalisation containing a subject relative (“x V1 y who V2 z”). Taking into account not only the sentence C that needs to be rephrased but also its semanticsMC may therefore help learning.\nWe model P (T |C;MC ; θ) using a multi-source sequence-to-sequence neural framework (we refer to this model as MULTISEQ2SEQ). The core idea comes from Zoph and Knight (2016) who show that a multi-source model trained on trilingual translation pairs ((f, g), h) outperforms sev-\neral strong single source baselines. We explore a similar “trilingual” setting where f is a complex sentence (C), g is the corresponding set of RDF triples (MC) and h is the output rephrasing (T ).\nWe encode C and MC using two separate RNN encoders. To encode MC using RNN, we first linearise MC by doing a depth-first left-right RDF tree traversal and then tokenise using the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline (Manning et al., 2014). Like in SEQ2SEQ, we model our decoder with the localp attention model with feed input as in (Luong et al., 2015), but now it looks at both source encoders simultaneously by creating separate context vector for each encoder.

A first model P (M1, . . . ,Mn|C;MC ; θ) learns to partition a set MC of RDF triples associated with a complex sentence C into a disjoint set {M1, . . . ,Mn} of sets of RDF triples.

We therefore also report on the average number of output simple sentences per complex sentence and the average number of output words per output simple sentence. The first one measures the ability of a system to split a complex sentence into multiple simple sentences and the second one measures the ability of producing smaller simple sentences.\nTable 3 shows the results. The high BLEU score for complex sentences (SOURCE) from the WEBSPLIT corpus shows that using BLEU is not sufficient to evaluate splitting and rephrasing. Because the short sentences have many n-grams in common with the source, the BLEU score for complex sentences is high but the texts are made of a single sentence and the average sentence length is high. HYBRIDSIMPL performs poorly – we conjecture that this is linked to a decrease in semantic parsing quality (DRSs) resulting from complex named entities not being adequately recognised. The simple sequence-to-sequence model does not perform very well neither does the multisource model trained on both complex sentences and their semantics. Typically, these two models often produce non-meaning preserving outputs (see example in Table 4) for input of longer length. In contrast, the two partition-and-generate models outperform all other models by a wide mar-\n8We used https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/ generic/multi-bleu.perl to estimate BLEU scores against multiple references.\ngin. This suggests that the ability to split is key to a good rephrasing: by first splitting the input semantics into smaller chunks, the two partitionand-generate models permit reducing a complex task (generating a sequence of sentences from a single complex sentence) to a series of simpler tasks (generating a short sentence from a semantic input).\nUnlike in neural machine translation setting, multi-source models in our setting do not perform very well. SEQ2SEQ and SPLITSEQ2SEQ outperform MULTISEQ2SEQ and SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ respectively, despite using less input information than their counterparts. The multi-source models used in machine translation have as a multi-source, two translations of the same content (Zoph and Knight, 2016). In our approach, the multi-source is a complex sentence and a set of RDF triples, e.g., (C;MC) for MULTISEQ2SEQ and (C;Mi) for SPLIT-MULTISEQ2SEQ. We conjecture that the poor performance of multi-source models in our case is due either to the relatively small size of the training data or to a stronger mismatch between RDF and complex sentence than between two translations.\nTable 4 shows an example output for all 5 systems highlighting the main differences. HYBRIDSIMPL’s output mostly reuses the input words suggesting that the SMT system doing the rewriting has limited impact. Both the SEQ2SEQ and the MULTISEQ2SEQ models “hallucinate” new information (“served as a test pilot”, “born on Nov 18, 1983”). In contrast, the partition-and-generate models correctly render the meaning of the input sentence (SOURCE), perform interesting rephrasings (“X was born in Y” → “X’s birth place was Y”) and split the input sentence into two."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have proposed a new sentence simplification task which we call “Split-and-Rephrase”. We\nhave constructed a new corpus for this task which is built from readily-available data used for NLG (Natural Language Generation) evaluation. Initial experiments indicate that the ability to split is a key factor in generating fluent and meaning preserving rephrasings because it permits reducing a complex generation task (generating a text consisting of at least two sentences) to a series of simpler tasks (generating short sentences). In future work, it would be interesting to see whether and if so how, sentence splitting can be learned in the absence of explicit semantic information in the input.\nAnother direction for future work concerns the exploitation of the extended WebNLG corpus. While the results presented in this paper use a version of the WebNLG corpus consisting of 13,308 MR-Text pairs, 7049 distinct MRs and 8 DBpedia categories, the current WebNLG corpus encompasses 43,056 MR-Text pairs, 16,138 distinct MRs and 15 DBpedia categories. We plan to exploit this extended corpus to make available a correspondingly extended WEBSPLIT corpus, to learn optimised Split-and-Rephrase models and to explore sentence fusion (converting a sequence of sentences into a single complex sentence)."

    "abstractText" : "We propose a new sentence simplification task (Split-and-Rephrase) where the aim is to split a complex sentence into a meaning preserving sequence of shorter sentences. Like sentence simplification, splitting-and-rephrasing has the potential of benefiting both natural language processing and societal applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP systems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and improves the performance of parsers, semantic role labelers and machine translation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading disabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter ones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we create and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tuples mapping a single complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning.1 Second, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to semantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed task.",
