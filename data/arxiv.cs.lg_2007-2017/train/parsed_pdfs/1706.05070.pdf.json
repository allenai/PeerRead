Program synthesis has become popular especially in settings aiming to help end users. In such settings, the requirements are not provided upfront and the synthesizer can only learn them by posing membership queries to the end user. Our work enables such synthesizers to learn the exact requirements while bounding the number of membership queries."

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Learning from membership queries (Angluin, 1988) has flourished due to its many applications in group testing (Du and Hwang, 2000, 2006), blood testing (Dorfman, 1943), chemical leak testing, chemical reactions (Angluin and Chen, 2008), electrical short detection, codes, multi-access channel communications (Biglieri and Gyrfi, 2007), molecular biology, VLSI testing, AIDS screening, whole-genome shotgun sequencing (Alon et al., 2002), DNA physical mapping (Grebinski and Kucherov, 1998) and game theory (Pelc, 2002). For a list of many other applications, see Du and Hwang (2000); Ngo and Du (2000); Bonis et al. (2005); Du and Hwang (2006); Cicalese (2013); Biglieri and Gyrfi (2007). Many of the new applications present new models and new problems. One of these is programming by example (PBE), a popular setting of program synthesis (Polozov and Gulwani, 2015; Barowy et al., 2015; Le and Gulwani, 2014; Gulwani, 2011; Jha et al., 2010). PBE has gained popularity because it enables end users to describe their intent to a program synthesizer via the intuitive means of input–output examples. The common setting of PBE is to synthesize a program based on a typically small set of user-provided examples, which are often an under-specification of the target program (Polozov and Gulwani, 2015; Barowy et al., 2015; Le and Gulwani, 2014; Gulwani, 2011). As a result, the synthesized program is not guaranteed to fully capture the user’s intent. Another (less popular) PBE approach is to limit the program space to a\ncchar∞3 2017 N.H. Bshouty, D.

A natural question is whether one can do better than the latter approach without sacrificing the correctness guaranteed by the former approach. In this paper, we answer this question for a class of specifications (i.e., formulas) that captures a wide range of programs.\nWe study the problem of learning a disjunctive (or dually, a conjunctive) formula describing the user intent through membership queries. To capture a wide range of program specifications, the formulas are over arbitrary, predefined predicates. In our setting, the end user is the teacher that can answer membership queries. This work enables PBE synthesizers to guarantee to the user that they have synthesized the correct program, while bounding the number of membership queries they pose, thus reducing the burden on the user.\nMore formally, let F be a set of predicates (i.e., boolean functions). Our goal is to learn the class F∨ of any disjunction of predicates in F . We present a learning algorithm SPEX, which learns any function in F∨ with polynomially many queries. We then show that given some computational complexity conditions on the set of predicates, SPEX runs in polynomial time.\nWe demonstrate the above on two classes. The first is the class of disjunctions (or conjunctions, whose learning is the dual problem) over any set H of halfspaces over a constant dimension. For this class, we show that SPEX runs in polynomial time. In particular, this shows that learning any convex polytope over a constant dimension when the sides are from a given set H can be done in polynomial time. For the case where the dimension is not constant, we show that learning this class implies P=NP. We note that there are other applications for learning halfspaces; for example, Hegedűs (1995); Zolotykh and Shevchenko (1995); Abboud et al. (1999); Abasi et al. (2014).\nThe second class we consider is conjunctions over F , where F is the set of variable inequalities, i.e., predicates of the form [xi > xj ] over n variables. If the set is acyclic (∧F 6= 0), we show that learning can be done in polynomial time. If the set is cyclic (∧F = 0), we show that learning is equivalent to the problem of enumerating all the maximal acyclic subgraphs of a directed graph, which is still an open problem (Acua et al., 2012; Borassi et al., 2013; Wasa, 2016).\nThe second class has practical importance because it consists of formulas that can be used to describe time-series charts. Time charts are used in many domains including financial analysis (Bulkowski, 2005), medicine (Chuah and Fu, 2007), and seismology (Morales-Esteban et al., 2010). Experts use these charts to predict important events (e.g., trend changes in a stock price) by looking for patterns in the charts. A lot of research has focused on common patterns and many platforms enable these experts to write a program that upon detecting a specific pattern alerts the user (e.g., some platforms for finance analysts are MetaTrader, MetaStock, Amibroker). Unfortunately, writing programs is a complex task for these experts, as they are not programmers. To help such experts, we integrated SPEX in a synthesizer that interacts with a user to learn a pattern (i.e., a conjunctive formula over variable inequalities). SPEX enables the synthesizer to guarantee that the synthesized program captures the user intent, while interacting with him only through membership queries that are visualized in charts.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and class we consider. Section 3 provides the main definitions we require for the algorithm. Section 4 presents the SPEX algorithm, discusses its complexity, and describes conditions under which SPEX is polynomial. Sections 5 and 6 discuss the two classes we consider: halfspaces and variable inequalities. Finally, Section 7 shows the practical application of SPEX in program synthesis."

      "text" : "Let F be a finite set of boolean functions over a domain X (possibly infinite). We consider the class of functions F∨ := {∨f∈Sf | S ⊆ F}. Our model assumes a teacher that has a target function F ∈ F∨ and a learner that knowsF but not the target function. The teacher can answer membership queries for the target function – that is, given x ∈ X (from the learner), the teacher returns F (x). The goal of the learner (the learning algorithm) is to find the target function with a minimum number of membership queries.\nNotations Following are a few notations used throughout the paper. OPT(F∨) denotes the minimum worst case number of membership queries required to learn a function F in F∨. Given F ∈ F∨, we denote by S(F ) the set that consists of all the functions in F . Formally, we define S(F ) = S, where S is the unique subset of F such that F = ∨ f∈S f . For example, S(f1 ∨ f2) = {f1, f2}. From this, it immediately follows that F1 ≡ F2 if and only if S(F1) = S(F2). For a set of functions S ⊆ F , we denote ∨S := ∨f∈Sf . Lastly, [S(x)] denotes the boolean value of a logical statement. Namely, given a statement S(x) : X → {T, F}with a free variable x, its boolean function [S(x)] : X → {0, 1} is defined as [S(x)] = 1 if S(x) = T , and [S(x)] = 0 otherwise. For example, [x ≥ 2] = 1 if and only if the interpretation of x is greater than 2."

This enables us in later sections to focus on the representative elements from F∨. Let F be a set of boolean functions over the domain X . The equivalence relation = over F∨ is defined as follows: two disjunctions F1, F2 ∈ F∨ are equivalent (F1 = F2) if F1 is logically equal to F2. In other words, they represent the same function (from X to {0, 1}). We write F1 ≡ F2 to denote that F1 and F2 are identical; that is, they have the same representation. For example, consider f1, f2 : {0, 1} → {0, 1} where f1(x) = 1 and f2(x) = x. Then, f1 ∨ f2 = f1 but f1 ∨ f2 6≡ f1.\nWe denote by F∗∨ the set of equivalence classes of = and write each equivalence class as [F ], where F ∈ F∨. Notice that if [F1] = [F2], then [F1 ∨ F2] = [F1] = [F2]. Therefore, for every [F ], we can choose the representative element to be GF := ∨F ′∈SF ′ where S ⊆ F is the maximum size set that satisfies ∨S = F . We denote by G(F∨) the set of all representative elements. Accordingly, G(F∨) = {GF | F ∈ F∨}. As an example, consider the set F consisting of four functions f11, f12, f21, f22 : {1, 2}2 → {0, 1} where fij(x1, x2) = [xi ≥ j]. There are 24 = 16 elements in Ray22 := F∨ and five representative functions in G(F∨): G(F∨) = {f11∨f12∨f21∨f22, f12∨f22, f12, f22, 0} (where 0 is the zero function).\nThe below listed facts follow immediately from the above definitions:\nLemma 1 Let F be a set of boolean functions.

Consider the Hasse diagram H(F∨) of G(F∨) for this partial order. The maximum (top) element in the diagram is Gmax := ∨f∈F f . The minimum (bottom) element is Gmin := ∨f∈Øf , i.e., the zero function. Figure 4 shows an illustration of the Hasse diagram of Ray22 (from Section 3.1). Figures 5 and 6 show other examples of Hasse diagrams: Figure 5 shows the Hasse diagram of boolean variables, while Figure 6 shows an example that extends the example of Ray22.\nIn a Hasse diagram, G1 is a descendant (resp., ascendent) of G2 if there is a (nonempty) downward path from G2 to G1 (resp., from G1 to G2), i.e., G1⇒G2 (resp., G2⇒G1) and G1 6= G2. G1 is an immediate descendant of G2 in H(F∨) if G1⇒G2, G1 6= G2 and there is no G such that G 6= G1, G 6= G2 and G1⇒G⇒G2. G1 is an immediate ascendant of G2 if G2 is an immediate descendant of G1. We now show (all proofs for this section appear in Appendix B):\nLemma 2 Let G1 be an immediate descendant of G2 and F ∈ F∨. If G1⇒F⇒G2, then G1 = F or G2 = F .\nWe denote by De(G) and As(G) the sets of all the immediate descendants and immediate ascendants of G, respectively. We further denote by DE(G) and AS(G) the sets of all G’s descendants and ascendants, respectively. For G1 and G2, we define their lowest common ascendent (resp., greatest common descendant) G = lca(G1, G2) (resp., G = gcd(G1, G2)) to be the boolean function G ∈ G(F∨) – that is, the minimum (resp., maximum) element in AS(G1) ∩ AS(G2) (resp., DE(G1)∩DE(G2)). Therefore, we can show Lemma 3. Lemma 3 abbreviates (G1⇒G and G2⇒G) to G1, G2⇒G and (G⇒G1 and G⇒G2) to G⇒G1, G2.\nLemma 3 Let G1, G2 ∈ G(F∨) and F ∈ F∨. 1.

In particular, if G1, G2 are two distinct immediate descendants of G, then G1 ∨G2 = G.\nNote that this does not imply that S(G1 ∨G2) = S(G1) ∪ S(G2) = S(lca(G1, G2)). In particular, G1 ∨G2 is not necessarily in G(F∨); see, for example, Figure 5 (right).\nLemma 5 follows from the fact that if G1 is a descendant of G2, then G1⇒G2, and therefore, G1 ∨G2 = G2.\nLemma 5 If G1 is a descendant of G2, then S(G1) ( S(G2).\nLemma 5 enables us to show the following.\nLemma 6 Let G1, G2 ∈ G(F∨).

      "heading" : "4. The Algorithm",
      "text" : "In this section, we present our algorithm to learn a target disjunction over F , called SPEX (short for specifications from examples). Our algorithm relies on the following results.\nLemma 9 Let G′ be an immediate descendant of G, a ∈ X be a witness for G and G′, and G′′ be a descendant of G.\n1. If G′′(a)=0, G′′ is a descendant of G′ or equal to G′. In particular, S(G′′) ⊆ S(G′). 2. If G′′(a)=1, G′′ is neither a descendant of G′ nor equal to G′. In particular, S(G′′) 6⊂ S(G′).\nProof Since G′′ is a descendant of G, we have S(G′′) ( S(G). By Lemma 7, for every f ∈ S(G′), we have f(a) = 0, and for every f ∈ S(G)\\S(G′), we have f(a) = 1. Thus, if G′′(a) = 0, then no f ∈ S(G)\\S(G′) is in S(G′′) (otherwise, G′′(a) = 1). Therefore, S(G′′) ⊆ S(G′) and G′′ is a descendant of G′ or equal to G′. Otherwise, if G′′(a) = 1 , then since G′(a) = 0, for every descendant G0 of G′ we have G0(a) = 0 and thus G′′ is neither a descendant of G′ nor equal to G′.\nLemma 9 drives the operation of SPEX. To find F (more precisely, GF ), SPEX starts from the maximal element in G(F∨) and traverses downwards through the Hasse diagram. At each step,\nSPEX considers an element G, checks its witnesses against its immediate descendants, and poses a membership query for each. If F and G agree on the witness of G and G′, then by Lemma 9, F cannot be G′ or its descendant, and thus these are pruned from the search space. Otherwise, if F and G′ agree on the witness, then F must be G′ or its descendant, and thus all other elements in G(F∨) are pruned.\nThe SPEX algorithm is depicted in Figure 1. SPEX calls the recursive algorithm Learn, which takes a candidate G and a set of subsets of F , T , which stores the elements already eliminated from F∨. Learn also relies on S, a set of functions over which F (i.e., GF ) is defined (i.e., S(GF ) ⊆ S). During the execution, S may be reduced. If not, then ∨S = F . Learn begins by initializing S to S(G). Then, it examines the immediate descendants of G whose ancestors have not been eliminated. When considering G′, a witness a is obtained and Learn poses a membership query to learn F (a). If F (a) = 0 (recall that G(a) = 1 since a is a witness), then G 6= F and F is inferred to be a descendant of G′ and is thus over the functions in S(G′). Accordingly, S is reduced. Otherwise, F is not a descendant of G′, and G′ and its descendants are eliminated from the search space by adding S(G′) to T . Finally, if G and F agreed on all the witnesses (evident by the Flag variable), then ∨S is returned (since G = F ). Otherwise, Learn is invoked on ∨S and T .\nTheorem 10 If the witnesses and the descendants of any G can be found in time t, then SPEX (Algorithm 1) learns the target function in time t · |F| and at most |F| · maxG∈G(F∨) |De(G)| membership queries.\nThe complexity proof follows from the following arguments. First, every invocation of SPEX presents a membership query for every immediate descendant of G, and thus the number of membership queries of a single invocation is at most the maximal number of immediate descendants, maxG∈G(F∨) |De(G)|. Second, recursive invocations always consider a descendant of the currently inspected candidate. Thus, the recursion depth is bounded by the height of the Hasse diagram, |F|.\nThis implies the total bound of |F| ·maxG∈G(F∨) |De(G)|membership queries. The fact that SPEX learns the target function follows from Lemma 11.\nLemma 11 Let F be the target function. If Learn returns ∨S, then GF = ∨S (?). Otherwise, if Learn(Gmax,Ø) calls Learn(∨S, T ), then:\n1. S(GF ) ⊆ S. That is, GF is a descendant of ∨S or equal to ∨S. 2. S(GF ) 6⊂ R for all R ∈ T . That is, GF is not a descendant of any ∨R, for R ∈ T or equal\nto ∨R.\nProof The proof is by induction. Obviously, the induction hypothesis is true for (Gmax,Ø). Assume the induction hypothesis is true for (∨S, T ). That is, S(GF ) ⊆ S and S(GF ) 6⊂ R for all R ∈ T . Let G′1, . . . , G ′ ` be all the immediate descendants of ∨S. If S(G′i) ⊆ R for some R ∈ T , G′i and all its descendants G′′ satisfy S(G′′) ⊆ S(G′i) ⊆ R and thus GF is not G′i or a descendant of G′i. Assume now that S(G′i) 6⊂ R for all R ∈ T . Let a(i) be a witness for ∨S and G′i. If F (a(i)) = 1, then by Lemma 9 GF is not a descendant of G′i and not equal to G ′ i. This implies that S(GF ) 6⊂ S(G′i), which is why S(G ′ i) is added to T (Line 6 in the Algorithm). This proves bullet 2.\nIf F (a(i)) = 1 for all i, then GF = ∨S. This follows since by Lemma 9, F is not any of ∨S descendants; thus by the induction hypothesis, it must be ∨S. This is the case when the Flag variable does not change to 0 and the algorithm outputs ∨S. This proves (?).\nIf F (a(i)) = 0, then by Lemma 9, GF is a descendant of G′i or equal to G ′ i. Let I be the set of all indices i for which F (a(i)) = 0. Then, GF is a descendant of (or equal to) all G′i, i ∈ I , and therefore, GF is a descendant of or equal to gcd({G′i}i∈I). By Lemma 6, S(gcd({G′i}i∈I)) = ∩i∈IS(Gi). Thus, the algorithm in Line 5 takes the new S to be ∩i∈IS(Gi). This proves bullet 1."

Let f ∈ Z(G,X ′) and x0 be a witness for G and G′, i.e., G(x0) = 1 and G′(x0) = 0. Therefore, x0 ∈ X ′ and f(x0) = 0 by the definition of Z. By Lemma 7, for every f ∈ S(G)\\S(G′), we have f(a) = 1. Since f ∈ S(G), it must be that f ∈ S(G′).\nLemma 15 shows how to construct descendants from elements in X . Lemma 16 determines when all immediate descendants of G were obtained, and if not, how to obtain a new element in X that leads to a new immediate descendant. The algorithm that finds all immediate descendants (Figure 2, right) follows directly from this lemma. In the following we denote ∧ S = ∧ f∈S f .\nLemma 16 Let G1, . . . , Gm be immediate descendants of G. There is no other immediate descendant for G if and only if\nG = m∨ i=1 ∧ (S(G)\\S(Gi)). (2)\nIf (2) does not hold, then for any counterexample a for (2), we have ∨Z(G, a) is a descendant of G but not equal to and not a descendant of any Gi, i = 1, . . . ,m.\nProof Only if: Suppose G 6= ∨mi=1 ∧ (S(G)\\S(Gi)) and let a be a counterexample. Since for all i, S(G)\\S(Gi) ⊆ S(G), we have ∨mi=1 ∧ (S(G)\\S(Gi))⇒G. Therefore, G(a) = 1 and for every i there is fi ∈ S(G)\\S(Gi) such that fi(a) = 0. Consider G′ = Z(G, a). Since fi(a) = 0, we have fi ∈ S(G′). Since fi 6∈ S(Gi), G′ is not a descendant of Gi. Since G′ is a descendant of G and not a descendant of any Gi, there must be another immediate descendant of G.\nIf: Denote W = ∨m\ni=1\n∧ (S(G)\\S(Gi)). Let G′ be another immediate descendant of G. Let\na be a witness for G and G′. Then G(a) = 1 and, by Lemma 7, for every f ∈ S(G)\\S(G′), we have f(a) = 1 and for every f ∈ S(G′), we have f(a) = 0. Since S(G′) 6⊂ S(Gi), we have S(G)\\S(Gi) 6⊂ S(G)\\S(G′), and therefore, (S(G)\\S(Gi)) ∩ S(G′) is not empty. Choose fi ∈ (S(G)\\S(Gi))∩S(G′). Then, fi ∈ S(G)\\S(Gi) and since fi ∈ S(G′), fi(a) = 0. Therefore, W (a) = 0. Since G(a) = 1, we get G 6= W ."

Therefore, using Lemma 17 does not enable us to obtain a polynomial time algorithm. Accordingly, we show a different way to determine whether a function is a representative (i.e., in G(F∧)), and then show how to obtain the immediate descendants in quadratic time (in n) and the witnesses in linear time. As a result, SPEX can run in polynomial time. Finally, we show that the number of membership queries is at most |I|.\nBefore we show the main lemma, Lemma 24, we present Lemma 23, a trivial lemma that we use to prove Lemma 24.\nLemma 23 Let I ⊆ [n]2 be an acyclic set, F ∈ FI∧, and a ∈ [n]n. Then, F (a) = 1 if and only if a is a topological sorting of GI(F ).\nIn particular, F is satisfiable and a satisfying assignment a ∈ [n]n can be found in linear time.\nNext we show our main lemma that enables us to determine the representative elements and the immediate descendants (in Lemmas 25–27).

Then, F1 = F2 if and only if R(I(F2))=R(I(F1)).\nWe now show how to decide whether F ∈ G(FI∧) – that is, whether F is a representative.\nLemma 25 Let I be an acyclic set and F ∈ FI∧. F ∈ G(FI∧) if and only if for every (i, j) ∈ I\\I(F ) there is no path from i to j in GI(F ).\nProof If: If for every (i, j) ∈ I\\I(F ) there is no path from i to j in GI(F ), then for every (i, j) ∈ I\\I(F ), R(I(F )∪ {(i, j)}) 6= R(I(F )) . By Lemma 24, this implies that F ∧ [xi > xj ] 6= F . By (the dual result of) Lemma 13, the result follows.\nOnly if: Now let F ∈ G(FI∧). By Lemma 13, for every [xi > xj ] 6∈ F , we have F ∧ [xi > xj ] 6= F . Therefore, there is an assignment a that satisfies ai ≤ aj and F (a) = 1. As before, if there is a path in GI(F ) from i to j, then we get a contradiction.\nWe now show how to determine the immediate descendants of G in polynomial time.\nLemma 26 Let I be acyclic. The immediate descendants of G ∈ G(FI∧) are all Gr,s := FI(G)\\{(r,s)} where (r, s) ∈ I(G) and there is no path from r to s in GI(G)\\{(r,s)}.\nIn particular, for all G ∈ G(FI∧), we have |De(G)| ≤ |I(G)| ≤ |I|.\nThe proof is in Appendix C. We now show how to find a witness.\nLemma 27 Let I be acyclic, G ∈ G(FI∧), and Gr,s := FI(G)\\{(r,s)} be an immediate descendant of G. A witness for G and Gr,s can be found in linear time.\nProof By Lemma 26, (r, s) ∈ I(G) and there is no path from r to s in GI(G)\\{(r,s)}. Therefore, if we match vertices r and s in GI(G)\\{(r,s)} we get an acyclic graph G′. Then, a topological sorting a for G′ is a satisfying assignment for Gr,s that satisfies ar = as. Since [xr > xs] ∈ S(G), we get G(a) = 0. Therefore, a is a witness for G and Gr,s.\nTo learn a function in FI∧, SPEX needs to find the immediate descendants of G and a witness for each immediate descendant and G. By Lemma 26, this involves finding a path between every two nodes in the directed graph GI(G), which can be done in polynomial time. By Lemma 27, to find a witness, SPEX needs a topological sorting, which can be done in linear time. Therefore, SPEX runs in polynomial time. Therefore, by Theorem 10 and Lemma 26, the class FI∧ is learnable in polynomial time with at most |I|2 membership queries. We now show that the number of membership queries is actually lower and equal to |I|.\nTheorem 28 Let I ⊆ [n]2 be acyclic. The class FI∧ is learnable in polynomial time with at most |I| membership queries.\nProof Consider the (dual) Algorithm SPEX in Figure 3 in Appendix A. Let F be the target function. Let Gmax = f1 ∧ f2 ∧ · · · ∧ ft where fi ∈ FI . By Lemma 26, we may assume w.l.o.g. that G(i) = f1 ∧ f2 ∧ · · · ∧ fi−1 ∧ fi+1 ∧ · · · ft where i = 1, . . . , ` are all the immediate descendants of G. Let a(i) be the witness for G and G(i), i = 1, . . . , `.\nIn the algorithm, S = {fi | i = 1, . . . , t}. If F (a(i)) = 1, then Line 5 in the algorithm removes fi from S and fi never returns to S. If F (a(i)) = 0, then the set {f1, f2, . . . , fi−1, fi+1, · · · ft} is added to T , which means (see Line 3) that SPEX never considers a descendant that does not contain fi. Namely, for every fi, SPEX makes at most one membership query.\nWe conclude this section by illustrating SPEX on an example, depicted in Figure 7. Assume the set of boolean functions is FI , where I = {(1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (3, 2)}, and the target is Gmin = 1. The graph in Figure 7 shows the Hasse diagram (in white and gray nodes) and the candidates that SPEX considers (in gray). The figure demonstrates that the number of membership queries is equal to |I|."

      "text" : "In this section, we explain the natural integration of SPEX into program synthesis. We then demonstrate this on a synthesizer that synthesizes programs that detect patterns in time-series charts. These programs meet specifications that belong to the class of variable inequalities I (for acyclic I).\nProgram synthesizers are defined over an input domain Xin, an output domain Xout, and a domain-specific language D. Given a specification, the goal of a synthesizer is to generate a corresponding program. A specification is a set of formulas ϕ(xin, xout) where xin is interpreted over Xin and xout is interpreted over Xout. Given a specification Y , a synthesizer returns a program P : Xin → Xout over D such that for all in ∈ Xin: (in, P (in)) |= Y (i.e., all formulas are satisfied for xin = in and xout = out). Roughly speaking, there are two types of synthesizers: • Synthesizers that assume that Y describes a full specification. Namely, for all in ∈ Xin, there\nexists a single out ∈ Xout such that (in, out) |= Y (e.g., Solar-Lezama et al. (2008); Singh and Solar-Lezama (2011); Alur et al. (2013); Bornholt et al. (2016)). • Synthesizers that assume that Y describes only input–output examples (known as PBE syn-\nthesizers). Namely, all formulas in the specification take the form of xin = in⇒xout = out (e.g., Gulwani (2011); Polozov and Gulwani (2015); Barowy et al. (2015)). The typical setting of a PBE synthesizer is that an end user (that acts as the teacher) knows a target program f and he or she provides the synthesizer with some initial examples and can interact with the synthesizer through membership queries (we note that most synthesizers do not interact).\nEach approach has its advantages and disadvantages. The first approach guarantees correctness on all inputs, but requires a full specification, which is complex to provide, especially by end users unfamiliar with formulas. On the other hand, PBE synthesizers are user-friendly as they interact through examples; however, generally they do not guarantee correctness on all inputs.\nWe next define the class of programs that are F-describable. For such programs, SPEX can be leveraged by both approaches to eliminate their disadvantage. Let F be a set of predicates over Xin ∪ Xout. A synthesizer is F-describable if every program that can be synthesized meets a specification F ∈ F∨ (or dually, F∧). A synthesizer that assumes that Y is a full specification and is F-describable can release the user from having to provide the full specification by first running SPEX and then synthesizing a program from the formula returned by SPEX. A PBE synthesizer that is F-describable can be extended to guarantee correctness on all inputs by first running SPEX and then synthesizing the program from the set of membership queries posed by SPEX. Theorem 32 follows immediately from Theorem 10.\nTheorem 32 LetF be a set of predicates andA be anF-describable synthesizer. Then,A extended with SPEX returns the target program with at most |F| ·maxG∈G(F∨) |De(G)| membership queries."

The specifications of these programs are over FI∧ for some I ⊆ [n]2 and thus the synthesizer learns the target program within |I| membership queries. Time-series are used in many domains including financial analysis (Bulkowski, 2005), medicine (Chuah and Fu, 2007), and seismology (MoralesEsteban et al., 2010). Experts use these charts to predict important events (e.g., trend changes in stock prices) by looking for patterns in the charts. There are a variety of platforms that enable users to write programs to detect a pattern in a time-series chart. In this work, we consider a domainspecific language (DSL) of a popular trading platform, AmiBroker. Our synthesizer can easily be extended to other DSLs.\nA time-series chart c : N → R maps points in time to real values (e.g., stock prices). A timeseries pattern is a conjunction FI for acyclic I . The size of FI is the maximal natural number it contains, i.e., the size of FI is argmaxi{i | ∃j.(i, j) ∈ I or (j, i) ∈ I}. A program detects a pattern FI of size k in a time-series chart c if it alerts upon every t ∈ N for which the t1, ..., tk−1 preceding extreme points satisfy FI(c(t1), ..., c(tk−1), c(t)) = 1.\nIn this setting, Xin is a set of charts over a fixed k ∈ N, that is f : {1, ..., k} → R, and Xout = {0, 1}. The DSL D is the DSL of the trading platform AmiBroker. We built a synthesizer that not only interacts with the end user through membership queries, but also displays them as charts (of size k). Thereby, our synthesizer communicates with the end user in his language of expertise. The synthesizer takes as input an initial chart example c′ : {1, ..., k} → R and initializes I to {(i, j) ∈ [k]2 | c′(i) ≥ c′(j)} and sets FI := {[xi ≥ xj ] |(i, j) ∈ I} (our results are true also for these kinds of predicates). It then executes SPEX to learn F . During the execution, every witness is translated into a chart (the translation is immediate since each witness is an assignment to k points). Finally, our synthesizer synthesizes a program by synthesizing instructions that detect the k extreme points in the chart, followed by an instruction that checks whether these points satisfy the formula F and alerts the end user if so (the technical details are beyond the scope of this paper). Namely, for the end user, our synthesizer acts as a PBE synthesizer, but internally it takes the first synthesis approach and assumes it is given a full specification (which is obtained by running SPEX).\nThe complexity of the overall synthesis algorithm is determined by SPEX (as the synthesis merely synthesizes the instructions according to the specification F ), and thus from Theorem 28, we infer the following theorem.\nTheorem 33 The pattern synthesizer returns a program that detects the target pattern in polynomial time with at most k2 membership queries, where k is the target pattern size."

Commonly, PBE algorithms synthesize programs consistent with the examples, which may not capture the user intent. Some works, however, guarantee to output the target program. For example, CEGIS (Solar-Lezama, 2008) learns a program via equivalence queries, and oracle-based synthesis (Jha et al., 2010) assumes that the input space is finite, which allows it to guarantee correctness by exploring all inputs (i.e., without validation queries). Synthesis has also been studied in a setting where a specification and the program’s syntax are given and the goal is to find a program over this syntax meeting the specification (e.g., Solar-Lezama et al. (2008); Singh and Solar-Lezama (2011); Alur et al. (2013); Bornholt et al. (2016)).\nQueries over Streams Several works aim to help analysts. Many trading software platforms provide domain-specific languages for writing queries where the user defines the query and the system is responsible for the sliding window mechanism, e.g., MetaTrader, MetaStock, NinjaTrader, and Microsoft’s StreamInsight (Chandramouli et al., 2010). Another tool designed to help analysts is Stat! (Barnett et al., 2013), an interactive tool enabling analysts to write queries in StreamInsight. TimeFork (Badam et al., 2016) is an interactive tool that helps analysts with predictions based on automatic analysis of the past stock price. CPL (Anand et al., 2001) is a Haskell-based high-level language designed for chart pattern queries. Many other languages support queries for streams. SASE (Wu et al., 2006) is a system designed for RFID (radio frequency identification) streams that offers a user-friendly language and can handle large volumes of data. Cayuga (Brenna et al., 2007) is a system for detecting complex patterns in streams, whose language is based on Cayuga algebra. SPL (Hirzel et al., 2013) is IBM’s stream processing language supporting pattern detections.

Proof of Lemma 4 Since G1, G2⇒lca(G1, G2), we get G1 ∨ G2⇒lca(G1, G2). Since G1, G2⇒(G1 ∨G2)⇒lca(G1, G2), by Lemma 3, we get G1 ∨G2 = lca(G1, G2). Proof of Lemma 6 Let G = gcd(G1, G2). We show that S(G) ⊆ S(G1) ∩ S(G2) and S(G1)∩S(G2) ⊆ S(G). By Lemma 5, S(G) ⊆ S(G1) and S(G) ⊆ S(G2), and therefore, S(G) ⊆ S(G1)∩S(G2). Since S(G) ⊆ S(G1)∩S(G2), we also have G = ∨S(G)⇒∨(S(G1)∩S(G2))⇒ G1, G2. Therefore, by Lemma 3, we get G = ∨(S(G1) ∩ S(G2)). Thus, S(G1) ∩ S(G2) ⊆ S(G)."

      "text" : "Proof of Lemma 24 Only if: Assume F1 = F2. Suppose, on the contrary, that there are i, j such that w.l.o.g. R(I(F1))i,j = 0 and R(I(F2))i,j = 1. Since I is acyclic and R(I(F2))i,j = 1, there is no path from j to i in GI (and therefore, in GI(F1)). Since R(I(F1))i,j = 0, there is also no path from i to j in GI(F1). Therefore, we can match the vertices i and j in GI(F1) (unify them into a single vertex) and get an acyclic graph G′. Using the topological sorting of G′, we get a satisfying assignment a for F1 that satisfies ai = aj . We now show that F2(a) = 0 and thus get a contradiction. Since R(I(F2))i,j = 1, there is a path i = i1 → i2 → · · · → i` = j from i to j in GI(F2). Therefore, F2 contains F ′ := [xi1 > xi2 ] ∧ [xi2 > xi3 ] ∧ · · · ∧ [xi`−1 > xi` ]. Since F2⇒F ′⇒[xi1 > xi` ] = [xi > xj ] and our assignment satisfies [ai > aj ] = 0, we get F2(a) = 0.\nIf: Assume R(I(F2)) = R(I(F1)). Suppose, on the contrary, that F2 6= F1. Then, there is an assignment a such that F2(a) = 1 and F1(a) = 0 (or vice versa). Since F1(a) = 0, a is not a topological sorting of GI(F1). Therefore, there is an edge i → j in GI(F1) such that ai ≤ aj . Since R(I(F2))i,j=R(I(F1))i,j=1, there is a path from i to j in GI(F2). As before, we get a contradiction. Proof of Lemma 26 Since (r, s) ∈ I(G), we have R(I(G))r,s=1. On the other hand, since there is no path from r to s in GI(G)\\{(r,s)}, we have R(I(Gr,s))r,s = 0. Therefore, R(I(G)) 6= R(I(Gr,s)) and by Lemma 24, we get G 6= Gr,s. By Lemma 14, Gr,s is an immediate descendant of G.\nTo show that there is no other immediate descendant, we use (the dual result of) Lemma 16. Note that S(G)\\S(Gr,s) = {[xr > xs]} and thus, by Lemma 16, it is sufficient to prove that G = G′ := ∧(i,j)∈J [xi > xj ], where J = {(i, j) ∈ I(G) | there is no path from i to j in GI(G)\\{(i,j)}}. To prove it, we show R(I(G′)) = R(J), and then the result follows from Lemma 24.\nIf R(J)i,j = 1, then R(I(G′))i,j = 1 since GI(G′) is a subgraph of GI(G). If R(I(G′))i,j = 1, then there is a path from i to j in GI(G′), and therefore, there is a path from i to j in GI(G), and thus R(I(G))i,j = 1. Since R(I(G))i,j = 1, there is a path p from i to j in GI(G). Let (r, s) 6∈ I(G)\\J . Then, (r, s) ∈ I(G) and there is a path (other than r → s) r → v1 → v2 → · · · → v` = s in GI(G). We now show that there is a path from i to j in GI(G)\\{(r,s)}. This is true because if the path p (in GI(G)) contains the edge r → s, then we can replace this edge with the path r → v1 → v2 → · · · → v` = s and get a new path from i to j in GI(G)\\{(r,s)}. Therefore, R(I(G)\\{(r, s)})i,j = 1. By repeating this on the other edges in I(G)\\J , we get R(J)i,j = 1. Proof of Theorem 31: If: Let A be an algorithm that for an input G, which is a directed graph, enumerates all the maximal acyclic subgraphs in polynomial time (poly(N(G), |V |, |E|)). The first step of SPEX (in Figure 3) finds all the immediate descendants of Gmax. By Lemma 29, this is equivalent to enumerating all the maximal acyclic subgraphs of GI . This can be done by A in time poly(N(GI), n, |I|). For every immediate descendant G′ of Gmax = 0, any topological sorting of G′ is a witness for G′ and G. Once SPEX calls Learn on one of the immediate descendants of Gmax, the algorithm proceeds as in the acyclic case. This algorithm runs in time poly(N(GI), n, |I|) time and asks at most N(GI) + |I| membership queries. By Lemma 30, the algorithm runs in time poly(OPT(FI∧), n, |I|) and asks at most OPT(FI∧) + |I| queries. Only if: Let B be a learning algorithm that runs in poly(OPT(FI∧), n, |I|). By the above argument:\nOPT(FI∧) ≤ N(GI) + |I|. (3)\nLet G = ([n], E) be any directed graph. We run the learning algorithm with the target FI where I = E. For any membership query asked by the algorithm, we answer 0 until the algorithm outputs the hypothesis Gmax = 0. Suppose A is the set of all membership queries that are asked by the algorithm. We now claim that:\n1. |A| = poly(N(G), n, |E|). 2. If G′ is a maximal acyclic subgraph of G, then there is an assignment a ∈ A such that\nE(G′) = {(i, j) ∈ E | ai > aj}, where E(G′) is the set of edges of G′. Bullet 1 follows since B runs in time poly(OPT(FI∧), n, |I|) and by (3) this is poly(N(G), n, |E|). So the number of membership queries cannot be more than poly(N(G), n, |E|) time.\nWe now prove bullet 2. There is an assignment a ∈ A that satisfies FE(G′)(a) = 1, because otherwise the algorithm cannot distinguish between FE(G′) and Gmax, which violates the correctness of the algorithm. Now, since FE(G′)(a) = 1, we must have E(G′) ⊆ {(i, j) ∈ E | ai > aj}. Since E(G′) is maximal (adding another edge will create a cycle), we get E(G′) = {(i, j) ∈ E | ai > aj}.\nThe algorithm that enumerates all the maximal acyclic subgraphs of G(V,E) continues to run as follows: for each a ∈ A, it defines Ea := {(i, j) ∈ E | ai > aj}. If Ga := ([n], Ea) is a maximal cyclic subgraph, then it lists Ga. Testing whether Ga := ([n], Ea) is maximal can be done in polynomial time (e.g., by checking edge-by-edge in E). It is easy to verify that the algorithm runs in poly(N(G), |V |, |E|) time."

Our algorithm asks at most |F| ·OPT(F∨) membership queries where OPT(F∨) is the minimum worst case number of membership queries for learning F∨. When F is a set of halfspaces over a constant dimension space or a set of variable inequalities, our algorithm runs in polynomial time. The problem we address has practical importance in the field of program synthesis, where the goal is to synthesize a program that meets some requirements. Program synthesis has become popular especially in settings aiming to help end users. In such settings, the requirements are not provided upfront and the synthesizer can only learn them by posing membership queries to the end user. Our work enables such synthesizers to learn the exact requirements while bounding the number of membership queries.",
