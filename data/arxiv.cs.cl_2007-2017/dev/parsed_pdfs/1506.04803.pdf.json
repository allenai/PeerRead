      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "There has recently been a spike in interest in the task of inferring the location of users of social media services, due to its utility in applications including location-aware information retrieval (Amitay et al., 2004), recommender systems (Noulas et al., 2012) and rapid disaster response (Earle et al., 2010). Social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook provide two primary means for users to declare their location: (1) through textbased metadata fields in the user’s profile; and (2) through GPS-based geotagging of posts and checkins. However, the text-based metadata is often missing, misleading or imprecise, and only a tiny proportion of users geotag their posts (Cheng et al., 2010). Given the small number of users with reliable location information, there has been significant interest\nin the task of automatically geolocating (predicting lat/long coordinates) of users based on their publicly available posts, metadata and social network information. These approaches are built on the premise that a user’s location is evident from their posts, or through location homophily in their social network.\nOur contributions in this paper are: a) the demonstration that network-based methods are generally superior to text-based user geolocation methods due to their robustness; b) the proposal of a hybrid classification method that backs-off from network- to text-based predictions for disconnected users, which we show to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy over all Twitter datasets we experiment with; and c) empirical evidence to suggest that text-based geolocation methods are largely competitive with network-based methods."

      "text" : "Past work on user geolocation falls broadly into two categories: text-based and network-based methods. Common to both methods is the manner of framing the geolocation prediction problem. Geographic coordinates are real-valued, and accordingly this is most naturally modelled as (multiple) regression. However for modelling convenience, the problem is typically simplified to classification by first pre-partitioning the regions into discrete sub-regions using either known city locations (Han et al., 2012; Rout et al., 2013) or a k-d tree partitioning (Roller et al., 2012; Wing and Baldridge, 2014). In the k-d tree methods, the resulting discrete regions are treated either as a flat list (as we do here) or a nested hierarchy."

      "heading" : "2.1 Text-based Geolocation",
      "text" : "Text-based approaches assume that language in social media is geographically biased, which is clearly evident for regions speaking different languages (Han et al., 2014), but is also reflected in regional dialects and the use of region specific terminology. Text based models have predominantly used bag of words features to learn per-region classifiers (Roller et al., 2012; Wing and Baldridge, 2014), including feature selection for location-indicative terms (Han et al., 2012).\nTopic models have also been applied to model geospatial text usage (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2013), by associating latent topics with locations. This has a benefit of allowing for prediction over continuous space, i.e., without the need to render the problem as classification. On the other hand, these methods have high algorithmic complexity and their generative formulation is unlikely to rival the performance of discriminative methods on large datasets."

      "heading" : "2.2 Network-based Geolocation",
      "text" : "Although online social networking sites allow for global interaction, users tend to befriend and interact with many of the same people online as they do off-line (Rout et al., 2013). Network-based methods exploit this property to infer the location of users from the locations of their friends (Jurgens, 2013; Rout et al., 2013). This relies on some form of friendship graph, through which location information can be propagated, e.g., using label propagation (Jurgens, 2013; Talukdar and Crammer, 2009). A significant caveat regarding the generality of these techniques is that friendship graphs are often not accessible, e.g., secured from the public (Facebook) or hidden behind a heavily rate-limited API (Twitter).\nWhile the raw accuracies reported for network-based methods (e.g., Jurgens (2013) and Rout et al. (2013)) are generally higher than those reported for text-based methods (e.g., Wing and Baldridge (2014) and Han et al. (2014)), they have been evaluated over different datasets and spatial representations, making direct comparison uninformative. Part of our contribution in this\npaper is direct comparison between the respective methods over standard datasets. In this, we propose both text- and network-based methods, and show that they achieve state-of-the-art results on three pre-existing Twitter geolocation corpora. We also propose a new hybrid method incorporating both textual and network information, which also improves over the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the text-only or network-only methods over two of the three datasets."

      "text" : "Our baseline method for text based geolocation is based on Wing and Baldridge (2014), who formulate the geolocation problem as classification using k-d trees. In summary, their approach first discretises the continuous space of geographical coordinates using a k-d tree such that each sub-region (leaf) has similar numbers of users. This results in many small regions for areas of high population density and fewer larger regions for country areas with low population density. Next, they use these regions as class labels to train a logistic regression model (“LR”). Our work is also subject to a sparse l1 regularisation penalty (Tibshirani, 1996). In their work, Wing and Baldridge (2014) showed that hierarchical logistic regression with a beam search achieves higher results than logistic regression over a flat label set, but in this research, we use a flat representation, and leave experiments with hierarchical classification to future work.\nFor our experiments, the number of users in each region was selected from {300, 600, 900, 1200} to optimise median error distance on the development set, resulting in values of 300, 600 and 600 for GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD, respectively. The l1 regularisation coefficient was also optimised in the same manner.\nAs features, we used a bag of unigrams (over both words and @-mentions) and removed all features that occurred in fewer than 10 documents, following Wing and Baldridge (2014). The features for each user were weighted using tf-idf, followed by per-user l2 normalisation. The normalisation is particularly important because our ‘documents’ are formed from all the tweets of each user, which vary significantly in size between users; furthermore, this adjusts for differing degrees of lexical variation (Lee, 1995). The number of features was almost 10K for GEOTEXT and about 2.5M for the other two corpora. For evaluation we use the median of all training locations in the sub-region predicted by the classifier, from which we measure the error against a test user’s gold standard location."

      "text" : "Next, we consider the approach of Jurgens (2013) who used label propagation (“LP”; Zhu and Ghahramani (2002)) to infer user locations using social network structure. Jurgens (2013) defined an undirected network from interactions among Twitter users based on @-mentions in their tweets, a mechanism typically used for conversations between friends. Consequently these links often correspond to offline friendships, and accordingly the network will exhibit a high degree of location homophily. The network is constructed by defining as nodes all users in a dataset (train and test), as well as other external users mentioned in their tweets. Unlike Jurgens (2013) who only created edges when both users mentioned one another, we created edges if either user mentioned the other. For the three datasets used in our experiments, bi-directional mentions were too rare to be useful, and we thus used the (weaker) uni-directional mentions as undirected edges instead. The edges between users are undirected and weighted by the number of @-mentions in tweets by either user.1\nThe mention network statistics for each of our datasets is shown in Table 1.2 Following Jurgens (2013), we ran the label propagation algorithm to update the location of each non-training node to the weighted median of its neighbours. This process continues iteratively until convergence, which occurred at or before 10 iterations."

      "heading" : "4.3 A Hybrid Method",
      "text" : "Unfortunately many test users are not transitively connected to any training node (see Table 1), meaning that LP fails to assign them any location. This can happen when users don’t use @-mentions, or when a set of nodes constitutes a disconnected component of the graph.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, we use the text for each test user in order to estimate their location, which is then used as an initial estimation during label propagation. In this hybrid approach, we first\n1As our datasets don’t have tweets for external users, these nodes do not contribute to the weight of their incident edges.\n2Note that @-mentions were removed in the published TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD datasets. To recover these we rebuilt the corpora from the Twitter archive.\nestimate the location for each test node using the LR classifier described above, before running label propagation over the mention graph. This iteratively adjusts the locations based on both the known training users and guessed test users, while simultaneously inferring locations for the external users. In such a way, the inferred locations of test users will better match neighbouring users in their sub-graph, or in the case of disconnected nodes, will retain their initial classification estimate."

      "heading" : "5 Results",
      "text" : "Table 2 shows the performance of the three methods over the test set for the three datasets. The results are also compared with the state of the art for TWITTER-US and TWITTERWORLD (Wing and Baldridge, 2014), and GEOTEXT (Ahmed et al., 2013).\nOur methods achieve a sizeable improvement over the previous state of the art for all three datasets. LP-LR performs best over GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US, while LR performs best over TWITTER-WORLD; the reduction in median error distance over the state of the art ranges from around 40% to over 95%. Even for TWITTER-WORLD, the\nresults for LP-LR are substantially better than the best-published results for that dataset.\nComparing LR and LP, no strong conclusion can be drawn — the text-based LP actually outperforms the network-based LR for two of the three datasets, but equally, the combination of the two (LP-LR) performs better than either component method over two of the three datasets. For the third (TWITTERWORLD), LR outperforms LP-LR due to a combination of factors. First, unlike the other two datasets, the label set is pre-discretised (everything is aggregated at the city level), meaning that LP and LR use the same label set.3 This annuls the representational advantage that LP has in the case of the other two datasets, in being able to capture a more fine-grained label set (i.e., all locations associated with training users). Second, there are substantially fewer disconnected test users in TWITTER-WORLD (see Table 1), meaning that the results for the hybrid LP-LR method are dominated by the empiricallyinferior LP.\nAlthough LR is similar to Wing and Baldridge (2014), we achieved large improvements over their reported results. This might be due to: (a) our use of @-mention features; (b) l1 regularisation, which is essential to preventing overfitting for large feature sets; or (c) our use of l2 normalisation of rows in the design matrix, which we found reduced errors by about 20% on GEOTEXT, in keeping with results\n3For consistency, we learn a k-d tree for TWITTER-WORLD and use the merged representation for LR, but the k-d tree largely preserves the pre-existing city boundaries.\nfrom text categorisation (Lee, 1995). Preliminary experiments also showed that lowering the term frequency threshold from 10 can further improve the LR results on all three datasets. LP requires few hyper-parameters and is relatively robust. It converged on all datasets in fewer than 10 iterations, and geolocates not only the test users but all nodes in the mention graph. Another advantage of LP over LR is the relatively modest amount of memory and processing power it requires."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We proposed a series of approaches to social media user geolocation based on: (1) text-based analysis using logistic regression with regularisation; (2) network-based analysis using label propagation; and (3) a hybrid method based on network-based label propagation, and back-off to text-based analysis for disconnected users. We achieve state-of-the-art results over three pre-existing Twitter datasets, and find that, overall, the hybrid method is superior to the two component methods.The LP-LR method is a hybrid approach that uses the LR predictions as priors. It is not simply a backoff from network information to textual information in the sense that it propagates the LR geolocations through the network. That is, if a test node is disconnected from the training nodes but still has connections to other test nodes, the geolocation of the node is adjusted and propagated through the network. It is possible to add extra nodes to the graph after applying the algorithm and to geolocate only these nodes efficiently, although this approach is potentially less accurate than inferencing over the full graph from scratch.\nLabel propagation algorithms such as Modified Adsorption (Talukdar and Crammer, 2009) allow for different levels of influence between prior/known labels and propagated label distributions. These algorithms require a discretised output space for label propagation, while LP can work directly on continuous data. We leave label propagation over discritised output and allowing different influence levels between prior and propagated label distributions to future work.\nThere is no clear consensus on whether text- or network-based methods are empirically superior at the user geolocation task. Our results show that the\nnetwork-based method (LP) is more robust than the text-based (LR) method as it requires a smaller number of hyper-parameters, uses less memory and computing resources, converges much faster and geolocates not only test users but all mentioned users. The drawback of LP is that it fails to geolocate disconnected test users. So for connected nodes – the majority of test nodes in all our datasets – LP is more robust than LR. Text-based methods are very sensitive to the regularisation settings and the types of textual features. That said, with thorough parameter tuning, they might outperform network-based method in terms of accuracy.\nIn future work, we hope to look at different types of network information for label propagation, more precise propagation methods to deal with non-local interactions, and also efficient ways of utilising both textual and network information in a joint model."
