INTRODUCTION\nSOURCE separation are problems in which several signalshave been mixed together and the objective is to recover the original signals from the combined signal. Source separation is important for several real-world applications. For example, the accuracy of chord recognition and pitch estimation can be improved by separating singing voice from music [1]. The accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) can be improved by separating noise from speech signals [2]. Monaural source separation, i.e., source separation from monaural recordings, is more challenging in that, without prior knowledge, there are an infinite number of solutions given only single channel information is available. In this paper, we focus on source separation from monaural recordings for applications of speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising tasks.\nP.-S. Huang and M.

We can categorize them into domain-specific and domain-agnostic approaches. For domain-specific approach, models are designed according to the prior knowledge and assumption of the tasks. For example, in the singing voice separation task, several approaches have been proposed to utilize the assumption of the low rank and sparsity of the music and speech signals, respectively [1], [3]–[5]. In the speech denoising task, spectral subtraction [6] subtracts a short-term noise spectrum estimate to generate the spectrum of clean speech. By assuming the underlying properties of speech and noise, statistical modelbased methods infer speech spectral coefficients given noisy observations [7]. However, in real-world scenarios, these strong assumptions may not always be valid. For example, in the singing voice separation task, the drum sounds may lie in the sparse subspace instead of being low rank. In the speech denoising task, the models often fail to predict the acoustic environments due to the non-stationary nature of noise.\nFor domain-agnostic approach, models are learned from data directly and can be expected to apply equally well to different domains. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) [8] and probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) [9], [10] learn the non-negative reconstruction bases and weights of different sources and use them to factorize time-frequency spectral representations. NMF and PLSI can be viewed as a linear transformation of the given mixture features (e.g. magnitude spectra) during prediction time. Moreover, by the minimum mean square estimate (MMSE) criterion, E[Y|X] is a linear model if Y and X are jointly Gaussian, where X and Y are the separated and mixture signals, respectively. In realworld scenarios, since signals might not always be Gaussian, we often consider the mapping relationship between mixture signals and different sources as a nonlinear transformation, and hence non-linear models such as neural networks are desirable.\nRecently, deep learning based methods have been used in many applications, including automatic speech recognition [11], image classification [12], etc. Deep learning based methods have also started to draw attention from the source separation research community by modeling the nonlinear mapping relationship between input and output. Previous work on deep learning based source separation can be further categorized into three ways: (1) Given a mixture signal, deep neural networks predict one of the sources. Maas et al. proposed using a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) for robust automatic speech recognition tasks [2]. Given noisy features, the authors apply a DRNN to predict clean speech features.\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n04 14\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.S D\n] 1\n3 Fe\nb 20\n15\nXu et al. proposed a deep neural network (DNN)-based speech enhancement system, including global variance equalization and noise-aware training, to predict clean speech spectra for speech enhancement tasks [13]. Weninger et al. [14] trained two long-short term memory (LSTM) RNNs for predicting speech and noise, respectively. Final prediction is made by creating a mask out of the two source predictions, which eventually masks out the noise part from the noisy spectrum. Liu et al. explored using a deep neural network for predicting clean speech signals in various denoising settings [15]. These approaches, however, only model one of the mixture signals, which is less optimal compared to a framework that models all sources together. (2) Given a mixture signal, deep neural networks predict the time-frequency mask between the two sources. In the ideal binary mask estimation task, Nie et al. utilized deep stacking networks with time series inputs and a re-threshold method to predict the ideal binary mask [16]. Narayanan and Wang [17] and Wang and Wang [18] proposed a two-stage framework using deep neural networks. In the first stage, the authors use d neural networks to predict each output dimension separately, where d is the target feature dimension; in the second stage, a classifier (one layer perceptron or an SVM) is used for refining the prediction given the output from the first stage. The proposed framework is not scalable when the output dimension is high and there are redundancies between the neural networks in neighboring frequencies. Wang et al. [19] recently proposed using deep neural networks to train different targets, including ideal ratio mask and FFT-mask, for speech separation tasks. These mask-based approaches focus on predicting the masking results of clean speech, instead of considering multiple sources simultaneously. (3) Given mixture signals, deep neural networks predict two different sources. Tu et al. proposed modeling two sources as the output targets for a robust ASR task [20]. However, the constraint that the sum of two different sources is the original mixture is not considered. Grais et al. [21] proposed using a deep neural network to predict two scores corresponding to the probabilities of two different sources respectively for a given frame of normalized magnitude spectrum.\nIn this paper, we further extend our previous work in [22] and [23] and propose a general framework for the monaural source separation task for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising. Our proposed framework models two sources simultaneously and jointly optimizes timefrequency masking functions together with the deep recurrent networks. The proposed approach directly reconstructs the prediction of two sources. In addition, given that there are two competing sources, we further propose a discriminative training criterion for enhancing source to interference ratio.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: Section II introduces the proposed methods, including the deep recurrent neural networks, joint optimization of deep learning models and a soft time-frequency masking function, and the training objectives. Section III presents the experimental setting and results using the TSP, MIR-1K, and TIMIT dateset for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising task, respectively. We conclude the paper in Section IV."

      "text" : "To capture the contextual information among audio signals, one way is to concatenate neighboring features together as input features to the deep neural network. However, the number of parameters increases proportionally to the input dimension and the number of neighbors in time. Hence, the size of the concatenating window is limited. A recurrent neural network (RNN) can be considered as a DNN with indefinitely many layers, which introduce the memory from previous time steps. The potential weakness for RNNs is that RNNs lack hierarchical processing of the input at the current time step. To further provide the hierarchical information through multiple time scales, deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) are explored [24], [25]. DRNNs can be explored in different schemes as shown in Figure 1. The left of Figure 1 is a standard RNN, folded out in time. The middle of Figure 1 is an L intermediate layer DRNN with temporal connection at the l-th layer. The right of Figure 1 is an L intermediate layer DRNN with full temporal connections (called stacked RNN (sRNN) in [25]). Formally, we can define different schemes of DRNNs as follows. Suppose there is an L intermediate layer DRNN with the recurrent connection at the l-th layer, the l-th hidden activation at time t is defined as:\nhlt = fh(xt,h l t−1) = φl ( Ulhlt−1 +W lφl−1 ( Wl−1 ( . . . φ1 ( W1xt )))) (1)\nand the output, yt, can be defined as:\nyt = fo(h l t) = WLφL−1 ( WL−1 ( . . . φl ( Wlhlt ))) (2)\nwhere xt is the input to the network at time t, φl is an elementwise nonlinear function, Wl is the weight matrix for the l-th layer, and Ul is the weight matrix for the recurrent connection at the l-th layer. The output layer is a linear layer.\nThe stacked RNNs have multiple levels of transition functions, defined as:\nhlt = fh(h l−1 t ,h l t−1)\n= φl(U lhlt−1 +W lhl−1t ) (3)\nwhere hlt is the hidden state of the l-th layer at time t. U l and Wl are the weight matrices for the hidden activation at time t− 1 and the lower level activation hl−1t , respectively. When l = 1, the hidden activation is computed using h0t = xt.\nFunction φl(·) is a nonlinear function, and we empirically found that using the rectified linear unit f(x) = max(0,x) [26] performs better compared to using a sigmoid or tanh function. For a DNN, the temporal weight matrix Ul is a zero matrix."

      "text" : "At time t, the training input, xt, of the network is the concatenation of features from a mixture within a window. We use magnitude spectra as features in this paper. The output targets, y1t and y2t , and output predictions, ŷ1t and ŷ2t , of the network are the magnitude spectra of different sources.\nSince our goal is to separate one of the sources from a mixture, instead of learning one of the sources as the target, we adapt the framework from [27] to model all different sources simultaneously. Figure 2 shows an example of the architecture.\nMoreover, we find it useful to further smooth the source separation results with a time-frequency masking technique, for example, binary time-frequency masking or soft timefrequency masking [1], [27]. The time-frequency masking function enforces the constraint that the sum of the prediction results is equal to the original mixture.\nGiven the input features, xt, from the mixture, we obtain the output predictions ŷ1t and ŷ2t through the network. The soft time-frequency mask mt is defined as follows:\nmt(f) = |ŷ1t(f)|\n|ŷ1t(f)|+ |ŷ2t(f)| (4)\nwhere f ∈ {1, . . . , F} represents different frequencies. Once a time-frequency mask mt is computed, it is applied to the magnitude spectra zt of the mixture signals to obtain the estimated separation spectra ŝ1t and ŝ2t , which correspond to sources 1 and 2, as follows:\nŝ1t(f) = mt(f)zt(f) ŝ2t(f) = (1−mt(f)) zt(f)\n(5)\nwhere f ∈ {1, . . . , F} represents different frequencies. The time-frequency masking function can be viewed as a layer in the neural network as well. Instead of training the network and applying the time-frequency masking to the results separately, we can jointly train the deep learning models with the time-frequency masking functions. We add an extra layer to the original output of the neural network as follows:\nỹ1t = |ŷ1t |\n|ŷ1t |+ |ŷ2t | zt\nỹ2t = |ŷ2t |\n|ŷ1t |+ |ŷ2t | zt\n(6)\nwhere the operator is the element-wise multiplication (Hadamard product).\nIn this way, we can integrate the constraints to the network and optimize the network with the masking function jointly. Note that although this extra layer is a deterministic layer, the network weights are optimized for the error metric between ỹ1t , ỹ2t and y1t , y2t , using back-propagation. The time domain signals are reconstructed based on the inverse short time Fourier transform (ISTFT) of the estimated magnitude spectra along with the original mixture phase spectra."

(7) measures the difference between predicted and actual targets. When targets have similar spectra, it is possible for the DNN to minimize Eq. (7) by being too conservative: when a feature could be attributed to either source 1 or source 2, the neural network attributes it to both. The conservative strategy is effective in training, but leads to reduced SIR (signal-to-interference ratio) in testing, as the network allows ambiguous spectral features to bleed through partially from one source to the other. Interference can be reduced, possibly at the cost of increased artifact, by the use of a discriminative network training criterion. For example, suppose that we define\nJDIS = −(1− γ) ln p12(y)− γD(p12‖p21) (8)\nwhere 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is a regularization constant. p12(y) is the likelihood of the training data under the assumption that the neural net computes the MSE estimate of each feature vector (i.e., its conditional expected value given knowledge of the mixture), and that all residual noise is Gaussian with unit covariance, thus\nln p12(y) = − 1\n2 T∑ t=1 ( ‖y1t − ỹ1t‖2 + ‖y2t − ỹ2t‖2 ) (9)\nThe discriminative term, D(p12‖p21), is a point estimate of the KL divergence between the likelihood model p12(y) and the model p21(y), where the latter is computed by swapping affiliation of spectra to sources, thus\nD(p12‖p21) = 1\n2 T∑ t=1 ( ‖y1t − ỹ2t‖2 + ‖y2t − ỹ1t‖2−\n‖y1t − ỹ1t‖2 − ‖y2t − ỹ2t‖2 ) (10)\nCombining Eqs.

The source separation evaluation is measured by using three quantitative values: Source to Interference Ratio (SIR), Source to Artifacts Ratio (SAR), and Source to Distortion Ratio (SDR), according to the BSS-EVAL metrics [28]. Higher values of SDR, SAR, and SIR represent better separation quality. The suppression of interference is reflected in SIR. The artifacts introduced by the separation process are reflected in SAR. The overall performance is reflected in SDR. For speech denoising task, we additionally compute the shorttime objective intelligibility measure (STOI) which is a quantitative estimate of the intelligibility of the denoised speech [29]. We use the abbreviations DRNN-k, sRNN to denote the DRNN with the recurrent connection at the k-th hidden layer,\nor at all hidden layers, respectively. We select the models based on the results on the development set. We optimize our models by back-propagating the gradients with respect to the training objectives. The limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-GoldfarbShanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is used to train the models from random initialization. An example of the separation results is shown in Figure 5.

In the TSP dataset, we choose four speakers, FA, FB, MC, and MD, from the TSP speech database. After concatenating all 60 sentences per each speaker, we use 90% of the signal for training and 10% for testing. Note that in the neural network experiments, we further divide the training set into 8:1 to set aside 10% of the data for validation. The signals are downsampled to 16kHz, and then transformed with 1024 point DFT with 50% overlap for generating spectra. The neural networks are trained on three different mixing cases: FA versus MC, FA versus FB, and MC versus MD. Since FA and FB are female speakers while MC and MD are male, the latter two cases are expected to be more difficult due to the similar frequency ranges of the same gender. After normalizing the signals to have 0 dB input SNR, the neural networks are trained to learn the mapping between an input mixture spectrum and the the corresponding pair of clean spectra.\nAs for the NMF experiments, 10 to 100 speaker-specific basis vectors are trained from the training part of the signal. The NMF separation is done by fixing the the known speakers’ basis vectors during the test NMF procedure while learning the speaker-specific activation matrices.\nIn the experiments, we explore two different input features: spectral and log-mel filterbank features. The spectral representation is extracted using a 1024-point short time Fourier transform (STFT) with 50% overlap. In the speech recognition literature [32], the log-mel filterbank is found to provide better results compared to mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and log FFT bins. The 40-dimensional log-mel representation and the first and second order derivative features are used in the experiments.\nFor neural network training, in order to increase the variety of training samples, we circularly shift (in the time domain) the signals of one speaker and mix them with utterances from the other speaker."

Including discriminative training objectives improves SDR and SIR, but results in slightly degraded SAR and similar STOI values.\nTo further evaluate the robustness of the model, we examine our model under a variety of situations in which it is presented with unseen data, such as unseen SNRs, speakers and noise types. In Figure 11 we show the robustness of this model under\nvarious SNRs. The model is trained on 0dB SNR mixtures and it is evaluated on mixtures ranging from 20 dB SNR to -18dB SNR. We compare the results between NMF, DNN without joint optimization of a masking layer, and DNN with joint optimization of a masking layer. In most cases, DNN with joint optimization achieves the best results. For 20 dB SNR case, NMF achieves the best performance. DNN without joint optimization achieves highest SIR in high SNR cases, though SDR/SAR/STOI are lower.\nNext we evaluate the robustness of the proposed methods for data which is unseen in the training stage. These tests provide a way of understanding the performance of the proposed approach to work when applied on unseen noise and speakers. We evaluate the models with three different cases: (1) the testing noise is unseen in training, (2) the testing speaker is unseen in training, and (3) both the testing noise and testing speaker are unseen in training stage. For the unseen noise case, we train the model on mixtures with Babble, Airport, Train and Subway noises, and evaluate it on mixtures that\ninclude a Drill noise (which is significantly different from the training noises in both spectral and temporal structure). For the unknown speaker case, we hold out some of the speakers from the training data. For the case where both the noise and speaker are unseen, we use the combination of the above.\nWe compare our proposed approach with NMF model and DNN without joint optimizing the masking layer [15]. These experimental results are shown in Figure 12. For the case where the speaker is unknown, we observe that there is only a mild degradation in performance for all models, which means that the approaches can be easily used in speaker variant situations. With the unseen noise we observe a larger degradation in results, which is expected due to the drastically different nature of the noise type. The result is still good enough compared to other NMF and DNN without joint optimizing the masking function. The result of the case where both the noise and the speaker are unknown, the proposed model performs slightly worse compared to DNN without joint optimization with the masking function.

      "text" : "In this paper, we explore different deep learning architectures, including deep neural networks and deep recurrent neural networks for monaural source separation problems. We further enhance the results by jointly optimizing a soft mask layer with the networks and exploring the discriminative training criteria. We evaluate our proposed method for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising tasks. Overall, our proposed models achieve 2.30∼4.98 dB SDR gain compared to the NMF baseline, while maintaining better SIRs and SARs in the TSP speech separation task. In the MIR-1K singing voice separation task, our proposed models achieve 2.30∼2.48 dB GNSDR gain and 4.32∼5.42 dB GSIR gain, compared to the previous proposed methods, while maintaining similar GSARs. Moreover, our proposed method also outperforms NMF and DNN baseline in various mismatch conditions in the TIMIT speech denoising task. To further improve the performance, one direction is to further explore using long short-term memory (LSTM) to model longer temporal information [34], which has shown great performance compared to conventional recurrent neural network as avoiding vanishing gradient properties. In addition, our proposed models can also be applied to many other applications such as robust ASR."

It is challenging in that, given only single channel information is available, there is an infinite number of solutions without proper constraints. In this paper, we explore joint optimization of masking functions and deep recurrent neural networks for monaural source separation tasks, including the monaural speech separation task, monaural singing voice separation task, and speech denoising task. The joint optimization of the deep recurrent neural networks with an extra masking layer enforces a reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we explore a discriminative training criterion for the neural networks to further enhance the separation performance. We evaluate our proposed system on TSP, MIR-1K, and TIMIT dataset for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising tasks, respectively. Our approaches achieve 2.30∼4.98 dB SDR gain compared to NMF models in the speech separation task, 2.30∼2.48 dB GNSDR gain and 4.32∼5.42 dB GSIR gain compared to previous models in the singing voice separation task, and outperform NMF and DNN baseline in the speech denoising task.",
