During training, graph-to-string rules are learned using a heuristic extraction algorithm. At test time, a graph transducer is applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences.

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) (Banarescu et al., 2013) is a semantic formalism encoding the meaning of a sentence as a rooted, directed graph. AMR uses a graph to represent meaning, where nodes (such as “boy”, “want-01”) represent concepts, and edges (such as “ARG0”, “ARG1”) represent relations between concepts. Encoding many semantic phenomena into a graph structure, AMR is useful for NLP tasks such as machine translation (Jones et al., 2012; Tamchyna et al., 2015), question answering (Mitra and Baral, 2015), summarization (Takase et al., 2016) and event detection (Li et al., 2015).\nAMR-to-text generation is challenging as function words and syntactic structures are abstracted away, making an AMR graph correspond to multiple realizations. Despite much literature so far on text-to-AMR parsing (Flanigan et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2015; Vanderwende et al., 2015; Pust et al., 2015; Artzi et al., 2015; Groschwitz et al., 2015; Goodman et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016), there has been little work on AMR-to-text generation (Flanigan et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016; Pourdamghani et al., 2016).\nFlanigan et al. (2016) transform a given AMR graph into a spanning tree, before translating it\nto a sentence using a tree-to-string transducer. Their method leverages existing machine translation techniques, capturing hierarchical correspondences between the spanning tree and the surface string. On the other hand, it suffers from error propagation since the output is constrained given a spanning tree due to the projective correspondence between them. Information loss in the graph-to-tree transformation step cannot be recovered. Song et al. (2016) directly generate sentences using graph-fragment-to-string rules. They cast the task of finding a sequence of disjoint rules to transduce an AMR graph into a sentence as a traveling salesman problem, using local features and a language model to rank candidate sentences. However, their method does not learn hierarchical structural correspondences between AMR graphs and strings.\nWe propose to leverage the advantages of hierarchical rules without suffering from graph-to-tree errors by directly learning graph-to-string rules. As shown in Figure 1, we learn a synchronous node replacement grammar (NRG) from a corpus of 〈AMR, sentence〉 pairs. At test time, we apply a graph transducer to collapse input AMR graphs and generate output strings according to the\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n00 50\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nF eb\n2 01\n7\nlearned grammar. Our system makes use of a loglinear model with real-valued features, tuned using MERT (Och, 2003), and beam search decoding. It gives a BLEU score of 25.62 on the SemEval2016 Task 8 benchmark, which is the best result reported so far."

      "heading" : "2.1 Grammar Definition",
      "text" : "A synchronous node replacement grammar (NRG) is a rewriting formalism: G = 〈N,Σ,∆, P, S〉, where N is a finite set of nonterminals, Σ and ∆ are finite sets of terminal symbols for the source and target sides, respectively. S ∈ N is the start symbol, and P is a finite set of productions. Each instance of P takes the form Xi → (〈F,E〉,∼), where Xi ∈ N is a nonterminal node, F is a rooted, connected AMR fragment with edge labels over Σ and node labels over N ∪ Σ, E is a corresponding target string over N ∪∆ and ∼ denotes the alignment of nonterminal symbols between F and E. A classic NRG (Engelfriet and Rozenberg, 1997, Chapter 1) also defines C, which is an embedding mechanism defining how F is connected to the rest of the graph when replacing Xi with F on the graph. Here we omit defining C and allow arbitrary connections1. Following Chiang\n1This may over generate, but does not affect our case, as in our bottom-up decoding procedure (section 3) when F is\nData: training corpus C Result: rule instances R\n1 R← []; 2 for (S,A) in C do 3 Rcur ← FRAGMENTEXTRACT(S,A); 4 for rj in Rcur do 5 R.APPEND(ri) ; 6 for ri in Rcur/{ri} do 7 if ri.CONTAINS(rj) then 8 rij ← ri.COLLAPSE(rj); 9 R.APPEND(rij) ;\n10 end 11 end 12 end 13 end\nAlgorithm 1: Rule extraction\n(2005), we use only one nonterminal X in addition to S, and use subscripts to distinguish different non-terminal instances.\nFigure 2 shows an example derivation process for the sentence “the boy wants to go” given the rule set in Table 1. Given the start symbol S, which is first replaced with X1, rule (c) is applied to generate “X2 to go” and its AMR counterpart. Then rule (b) is used to generate “X3 wants” and its AMR counterpart from X2. Finally, rule (a) is used to generate “the boy” and its AMR counterpart from X3. Our graph-to-string rules are inspired by synchronous grammars for machine translation (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2002; Gildea, 2003; Chiang, 2005; Huang et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Induced Rules",

Here we first introduce induced rules, which are obtained by a two-step procedure on a training corpus. Shown in Algorithm 1, the first\nreplaced with Xi, nodes previously connected to F are reconnected to Xi\nstep is to extract a set of initial rules from training 〈sentence, AMR〉 pairs (Line 2) using the phraseto-graph fragment extraction algorithm of Peng et al. (2015) (Line 3). Here an initial rule contains only terminal symbols in both F and E. As a next step, we match between pairs of initial rules ri and rj according to Cai and Knight (2013), and generate rij by collapsing ri with rj , if ri contains rj\n2 (Line 6-8). When collapsing ri with rj , we replace the corresponding subgraph in ri.F with a new non-terminal node, and the sub-phrase in ri.E with a non-terminal. For example, we obtain rule (b) from rules (d) and (a) in Table 1. All initial and generated rules are stored in a rule list R (Lines 5 and 9), which will be further normalized to obtain the final induced rule set."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.3 Concept Rules and Glue Rules",
      "text" : "In addition to induced rules, we adopt concept rules (Song et al., 2016) and graph glue rules to ensure existence of derivations. For a concept rule, F is a single node in the input AMR graph, and E is a morphological string of the node concept. A concept rule is used in case no induced rule can cover the node. We refer to the verbalization list3 and AMR guidelines4 for creating more complex concept rules. For example, one concept rule created from the verbalization list is “(k / keep-01 :ARG1 (p / peace)) ||| peacekeeping”.\nInspired by Chiang (2005), we define graph glue rules to concatenate non-terminal nodes connected with an edge, when no induced rules can be applied. Three glue rules are defined for each type of edge label. Taking the edge label “ARG0” as an example, we create the following glue rules: r1 (X1 / #X1# :ARG0 (X2 / #X2#)) ||| #X1# #X2# r2 (X1 / #X1# :ARG0 (X2 / #X2#)) ||| #X2# #X1# r3 (X1 / #X1# :ARG0 X1) ||| #X1# where for both r1 and r2, F contains two nonterminal nodes with a directed edge connecting them, and E is the concatenation the two nonterminals in either the monotonic or the inverse order. For r3, F contains one non-terminal node with a self-pointing edge, and E is the nonterminal. With concept rules and glue rules in our final rule set, it is easily guaranteed that there are legal derivations for any input AMR graph.\n2more formally, rj .F is a subgraph of ri.F and ri.E contains rj .E\n3http://amr.isi.edu/download/lists/verbalization-listv1.06.txt\n4https://github.com/amrisi/amrguidelines/blob/master/amr.md"

The feature set that we adopt includes phrase-to-graph and graph-to-phrase translation probabilities and their corresponding lexicalized translation probabilities (section 3.1), language model score, word count, rule count, reordering model score (section 3.2) and moving distance (section 3.3). The language model score, word count and phrase count features are adopted from SMT (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2005).\nWe perform bottom-up search to transduce input AMRs to surface strings. Each hypothesis contains the current AMR graph, translations of collapsed subgraphs, the feature vector and the current model score. Beam search is adopted, where hypotheses with the same number of collapsed edges and nodes are put into the same beam."

Equation 3 can be regarded as a “soft” version of the lexicalized translation probabilities adopted by SMT, which picks the alignment yielding the maximum lexicalized probability for each translation rule. In addition to p(F |E)\nand pw(F |E), we use features in the reverse direction, namely p(E|F ) and pw(E|F ), the definitions of which are omitted as they are consistent with Equations 2 and 3, respectively.

Rules are extracted from the training data, and model parameters are tuned on the dev set. For tuning and testing, we filter out sentences with more than 30 words, resulting in 1103 dev instances and 1055 test instances. We train a 4-gram language model (LM) on gigaword (LDC2011T07), and use BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as the evaluation metric. MERT is used (Och, 2003) to tune model parameters on k-best outputs on the devset, where k is set 20.\nWe investigate the effectiveness of rules and features by ablation tests: “NoInducedRule” does not adopt induced rules, “NoConceptRule” does not adopt concept rules, “NoMovingDistance” does not adopt the moving distance feature, and “NoReorderModel” disables the reordering model. Given an AMR graph, if NoConceptRule\ncannot produce a legal derivation, we concatenate existing translation fragments into a final translation, and if a subgraph can not be translated, the empty string is used as the output. We also compare our method with previous works, in particular JAMR-gen (Flanigan et al., 2016) and TSP-gen (Song et al., 2016), on the same dataset."

NoInducedRule leads to the greatest performance drop compared with All, demonstrating that induced rules play a very important role in our system. On the other hand, NoConceptRule does not lead to much performance drop. This observation is consistent with the observation of Song et al. (2016) for their TSP-based system. NoMovingDistance leads to a significant performance drop, empirically verifying the fact that the translations of nearby subgraphs are also close. Finally, NoReorderingModel does not affect the performance significantly, which can be because the most important reordering patterns are already covered by the hierarchical induced rules. Compared with TSP-gen and JAMR-gen, our final model All improves the BLEU from 22.44 and 23.00 to 25.62, showing the advantage of our model. To our knowledge, this is the best result reported so far on the task."
