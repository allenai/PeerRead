      "text" : "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has emerged as an important task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to its applicability in information extraction, question answering, and other NLP tasks. SRL is the problem of finding predicate-argument structure in a sentence, as illustrated below:\n[A0 Mike ] has [PRED written ][A1 a book ] (S1)\nHere, the predicate WRITE has two arguments: ‘Mike’ as A0 or the writer, and ‘a book’ as A1 or the thing written. The labels A0 and A1 correspond to the PropBank annotations (Palmer et al., 2005).\nAs the need for SRL arises in different domains and languages, the existing manually annotated\ncorpora become insufficient to build supervised systems. This has motivated work on unsupervised SRL (Lang and Lapata, 2011b; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Garg and Henderson, 2012). Previous work has indicated that unsupervised systems could benefit from the word alignment information in parallel text in two or more languages (Naseem et al., 2009; Snyder et al., 2009; Titov and Klementiev, 2012b). For example, consider the German translation of sentence S1: [A0Mike] hat [A1ein Buch][PREDgeschrieben] (S2)\nIf sentences S1 and S2 have the word alignments: Mike-Mike, written-geschrieben, and book-Buch, the system might be able to predict A1 for Buch, even if there is insufficient information in the monolingual German data to learn this assignment. Thus, in languages where the resources are sparse or not good enough, or the distributions are not informative, SRL systems could be made more accurate by using parallel data with resource rich or more amenable languages.\nIn this paper, we propose a joint Bayesian model for unsupervised semantic role induction in multiple languages. The model consists of individual Bayesian models for each language (Garg and Henderson, 2012), and crosslingual latent variables to incorporate soft role agreement between aligned constituents. This latent variable approach has been demonstrated to increase the performance in a multilingual unsupervised part-of-speech tagging model based on HMMs (Naseem et al., 2009). We investigate the application of this approach to unsupervised SRL, presenting the performance improvements obtained in different settings involving labeled and unlabeled data, and analyzing the annotation effort required to obtain similar gains using labeled data.\nWe begin by briefly describing the unsupervised SRL pipeline and the monolingual semantic role induction model we use, and then describe our multilingual model.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n01 51\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nM ar\n2 01\n6"

      "text" : "As established in previous work (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2005), we use a standard unsupervised SRL setup, consisting of the following steps:\n1. Syntactic Parsing Off-the-shelf parsers can be used to syntactically parse a given sentence. We use a dependency parse because of its simplicity and easier comparison with the previous work in unsupervised SRL.\n2. Predicate Identification We select all the nonauxiliary verbs in a sentence as predicates.\n3. Argument Identification For a given predicate, this step classifies each constituent of the parse tree as a semantic argument or a nonargument. Heuristics based on syntactic features such as the dependency relation of a constituent to its head, path from the constituent to the predicate, etc. have been used in unsupervised SRL.\n4. Argument Classification Without access to semantic role labels, unsupervised SRL systems cast the problem as a clustering problem. Arguments of a predicate in all the sentences are divided into clusters such that each cluster corresponds to a single semantic role. The better this clustering is, the easier it becomes for a human to give it an actual semantic role label like A0, A1, etc. Our model assigns a role variable to every identified argument. This variable can take any value from 1 toN , whereN is the number of semantic roles that we want to induce.\nThe task we model, unsupervised semantic role induction, is the step 4 of this pipeline."

      "text" : "We use the Bayesian model of Garg and Henderson (2012) as our base monolingual model. The semantic roles are predicate-specific. To model the role ordering and repetition preferences, the role inventory for each predicate is divided into Primary and Secondary roles as follows:\nPrimary Role (PR) Let there be a total of N roles (or clusters) for each predicate. Assign K of them as PRs {P1, P2, ..., PK}. Further, create 3 additional PRs: START denoting the start of the role sequence, END denoting its end, and PRED denoting the predicate. These (K + 3) PRs are not allowed to repeat in a frame and their ordering defines the global role ordering.\nSecondary Role (SR) The rest of the (N − K) roles are called SRs {S1, S2, ..., SN−K}. Unlike PRs, they are not constrained to occur only once and only their ordering w.r.t. PRs is used in the probability model.\nFor example, the complete role sequence in a frame could be: (START , P3, S1, S1, PRED, P2, S5, END). The ordering is defined as the sequence of PRs, (START , P3, PRED, P2, END). Each pair of consecutive PRs in an ordering is called an interval. Thus, (P3, PRED) is an interval that contains two SRs, S1 and S1. An interval could also be empty, for instance (START, P3) contains no SRs. When we evaluate, these roles get mapped to gold roles. For instance, the PR P2 could get mapped to a core role like A0, A1, etc. or to a modifier role like AM−TMP , AM−MOD, etc. Garg and Henderson (2012) reported that, in practice, PRs mostly get mapped to core roles and SRs to modifier roles, which conforms to the linguistic motivations for this distinction.\nFigure 4 illustrates two copies of the monolingual model, on either side of the crosslingual latent variables. The generative process is as follows:\n1. Predicate, Voice The predicate p and its voice vc are treated as top-level visible variables.\n2. Ordering (Generate PRs) Select an ordered set of PRs from a multinomial distribution. o ∼Multinomial(θorderp,vc )\n3. Generate SRs For each interval in the ordering o, a sequence of SRs is generated as:\nfor each interval I ∈ o: draw an indicator s ∼ Binomial(θSTOPp,I,0 ) while s 6= STOP :\nchoose a SR r ∼Multinomial(θSRp,I) draw an indicator s ∼ Binomial(θSTOPp,I,1 )\n4. Generate Features For each PR and SR, the features for that constituent are generated independently. To keep the model simple and comparable to previous unsupervised work, we only use three features: (i) dependency relation of the argument to its head, (ii) head word of the argument, and (iii) POS tag of the head word:\nfor each generated role r: for each feature type f : choose a value vf ∼Multinomial(θFp,r,f )\nAll the multinomial and binomial distributions have symmetric Dirichlet and beta priors respectively.

This formulation models the global role ordering and repetition preferences using PRs, and limited context for SRs using intervals.

      "heading" : "4 Multilingual Model",
      "text" : "The multilingual model uses word alignments between sentences in a parallel corpus to exploit role correspondences across languages. We make copies of the monolingual model for each language and add additional crosslingual latent variables (CLVs) to couple the monolingual models, capturing crosslingual semantic role patterns. Concretely, when training on parallel sentences, whenever the head words of the arguments are aligned, we add a CLV as a parent of the two corresponding role variables. Figure 4 illustrates this model. The generative process, as explained below, remains the same as the monolingual model for the most part, with the exception of aligned\nroles which are now generated by both the monolingual process as well as the CLV.\n1. Monolingual Data Given a parallel frame with the predicate pair p1, p2, generate two separate monolingual frames as in section 3.\n2. Aligned Arguments For each aligned argument, first generate a crosslingual latent variable from a Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then generate the two aligned roles:\nfor aligned arguments i, j: draw a crosslingual latent variable: z ∼ CRP (αCRPp1,p2)\ndraw role for language l1: ri ∼Multinomial(θalignp1,p2,z,l1) draw role for language l2: rj ∼Multinomial(θalignp1,p2,z,l2)\nEvery predicate-tuple has its own inventory of CLVs specific to that tuple. Each CLV z is a multivalued variable where each value defines a distribution over role labels for each language (denoted by θalignp1,p2,z,l above). These distributions over labels are trained to be peaky, so that each value c for a CLV represents a correlation between the labels that c predicts in the two languages. For ex-\nample, a value c for the CLV z might give high probabilities to S3 and S8 in language 1, and to S1 in language 2. If c is the only value for z that gives high probability to S3 in language 1, and the monolingual model in language 1 decides to assign S3 to the role for z, then z will predict S1 in language 2, with high probability. We generate the CLVs via a Chinese Restaurant Process (Pitman, 2002), a non-parametric Bayesian model, which allows us to induce the number of CLVs for every predicate-tuple from the data. We continue to train on the non-parallel sentences using the respective monolingual models.\nThe multilingual model is deficient, since the aligned roles are being generated twice. Ideally, we would like to add the CLV as additional conditioning variables in the monolingual models. The new joint probability can be written as equation 5 (Figure 2a), which can be further decomposed following the decomposition of the monolingual model in Figure 1a. However, having this additional conditioning variable breaks the Dirichletmultinomial conjugacy, which makes it intractable to marginalize out the parameters during inference. Hence, we use an approximation where we treat each of the aligned roles as being generated twice, once by the monolingual model and once by the corresponding CLV (equation 6).\nThis is the first work to incorporate the coupling of aligned arguments directly in a Bayesian SRL model. This makes it easier to see how to extend this model in a principled way to incorporate additional sources of information. First, the model scales gracefully to more than two languages. If there are a total of n languages, and there is an aligned argument in m of them, the\nmultilingual latent variable is connected to only those m aligned arguments.\nSecond, having one joint Bayesian model allows us to use the same model in various semisupervised learning settings, just by fixing the annotated variables during training. Section 6.6 evaluates a setting where we have some labeled data in one language (called source), while no labeled data in the second language (called target). Note that this is different from a classic annotation projection setting (e.g. (Padó and Lapata, 2009)), where the role labels are mapped from source constituents to aligned target constituents."

      "text" : "The inference problem consists of predicting the role labels and CLVs (the hidden variables) given the predicate, its voice, and syntactic features of all the identified arguments (the visible variables). We use a collapsed Gibbs-sampling based approach to generate samples for the hidden variables (model parameters are integrated out). The sample counts and the priors are then used to calculate the MAP estimate of the model parameters.\nFor the monolingual model, the role at a given position is sampled as:\nP (ri|r−i,f ,p,vc,D−)∝P (ri,r−i,f |p,vc,D−)\n= ∫ P (ri,r−i,f |θ,p,vc)P (θ|D−)dθ\nwhere the subscript −i refers to all the variables except at position i, D− refers to the variables in all the training instances except the current one, and θ refers to all the model parameters. The above integral has a closed form solution due to Dirichlet-multinomial conjugacy.\nFor sampling roles in the multilingual model, we also need to consider the probabilities of roles being generated by the CLVs:\nP (ri|r−i,f ,p,vc,z,D−)∝P (ri,r−i,f |z,p,vc,D−)\n= ∫ P (ri,r−i,f |θ,z,p,vc)P (θ|D−)dθ\n= ∫ P (ri,r−i,f |θ,p,vc)( ∏ P (rj |θ,zk)\nj,k:zk→rj )P (θ|D−)dθ\nFor sampling CLVs, we need to consider three factors: two corresponding to probabilities of generating the aligned roles, and the third one corresponding to selecting the CLV according to CRP.\nP (zk|rl1i ,rl2j ,D−,k)∝P (rl1i |zk,D−,k)P (rl2j |zk,D−,k)P (zk|D−,k)\nwhere the aligned roles rl1i and r l2 j are connected to zk, and D−,k refers to all the variables except zk, rl1i , and r l2 j .\nWe use the trained parameters to parse the monolingual data using the monolingual model. The crosslingual parameters are ignored even if they were used during training. Thus, the information coming from the CLVs acts as a regularizer for the monolingual models."

      "heading" : "6.3 Closest Previous Work",
      "text" : "This work is closely related to the cross-lingual unsupervised SRL work of Titov and Klementiev (2012b). Their model has separate monolingual models for each language and an extra penalty term which tries to maximize P (rl2|rl1) and P (rl1|rl2) i.e. for all the aligned arguments with role label rl1 in language 1, it tries to find a role label rl2 in language 2 such that the given proportion is maximized and vice verse. However, there is no efficient way to optimize the objective with this penalty term and the authors used an inference method similar to annotation projection. Further, the method does not scale naturally to more than two languages. Their algorithm first does monolingual inference in one language ignoring the penalty and then does the inference in the second language taking into account the penalty term. In contrast, our model adds the latent variables as a part of the model itself, and not an external penalty, which enables us to use the standard Bayesian learning methods such as sampling.\nThe monolingual model we use (Garg and Henderson, 2012) also has two main advantages over Titov and Klementiev (2012b). First, the former incorporates a global role ordering probability that is missing in the latter. Secondly, the latter defines argument-keys as a tuple of four syntactic features and all the arguments having the same argumentkeys are assigned the same role. This kind of hard clustering is avoided in the former model where two constituents having the same set of features might get assigned different roles if they appear in different contexts."

We get about 40k EN and 36k DE sentences from the CoNLL 2009 training set, and about 1.5M parallel EN-DE sentences from Europarl. For appropriate comparison, we keep the same setting as in (Titov and Klementiev, 2012b) for automatic parses and ar-\ngument identification, which we briefly describe here. The EN sentences are parsed syntactically using MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2007) and DE using LTH parser (Johansson and Nugues, 2008). All the non-auxiliary verbs are selected as predicates. In CoNLL data, this gives us about 3k EN and 500 DE predicates. The total number of predicate instances are 3.4M in EN (89k CoNLL + 3.3M Europarl) and 2.62M in DE (17k CoNLL + 2.6M Europarl). The arguments for EN are identified using the heuristics proposed by Lang and Lapata (2011a). However, we get an F1 score of 85.1% for argument identification on CoNLL 2009 EN data as opposed to 80.7% reported by Titov and Klementiev (2012b). This could be due to implementation differences, which unfortunately makes our EN results incomparable. For DE, the arguments are identified using the LTH system (Johansson and Nugues, 2008), which gives an F1 score of 86.5% on the CoNLL 2009 DE data. The word alignments for the EN-DE parallel Europarl corpus are computed using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). For high-precision, only the intersecting alignments in the two directions are kept. We define two semantic arguments as aligned if their head-words are aligned. In total we get 9.3M arguments for EN (240k CoNLL + 9.1M Europarl) and 4.43M for DE (32k CoNLL + 4.4M Europarl). Out of these, 0.76M arguments are aligned."

      "text" : "Since the CoNLL annotations have 21 semantic roles in total, we use 21 roles in our model as well as the baseline. Following Garg and Henderson (2012), we set the number of PRs to 2 (excluding START , END and PRED), and SRs to 21-2=19. Table 1 shows the results.\nIn the first setting (Line 1), we train and test the monolingual model on the CoNLL data. We observe significant improvements in F1 score over the Baseline (Line 0) in both languages. Using the CoNLL 2009 dataset alone, Titov and Klementiev (2012b) report an F1 score of 80.9% (PU=86.8%, CO=75.7%) for German. Thus, our monolingual model outperforms their monolingual model in German. For English, they report an F1 score of 83.6% (PU=87.5%, CO=80.1%), but note that our English results are not directly comparable to theirs due to differences argument identification, as discussed in section 6.4. As their argument identification score is lower, perhaps their system\nis discarding “difficult” arguments which leads to a higher clustering score.\nIn the second setting (Line 2), we use the additional monolingual Europarl (EP) data for training. We get equivalent results in English and a significant improvement in German compared to our previous setting (Line 1). The German dataset in CoNLL is quite small and benefits from the additional EP training data. In contrast, the English model is already quite good due to a relatively big dataset from CoNLL, and good accuracy syntactic parsers. Unfortunately, Titov and Klementiev (2012b) do not report results with this setting.\nThe third setting (Line 3) gives the results of our multilingual model, which adds the word alignments in the EP data. Comparing with Line 2, we get non-significant improvements in both languages. Titov and Klementiev (2012b) obtain an F1 score of 82.7% (PU=85.0%, CO=80.6%) for German, and 83.7% (PU=86.8%, CO=80.7%) for English. Thus, for German, our multilingual Bayesian model is able to capture the cross-lingual patterns at least as well as the external penalty term in (Titov and Klementiev, 2012b). We cannot compare the English results unfortunately due to differences in argument identification.\nWe also compared monolingual and bilingual training data using a setting that emulates the standard supervised setup of separate training and test data sets. We train only on the EP dataset and test on the CoNLL dataset. Lines 4 and 5 of Table 1 give the results. The multilingual model obtains small improvements in both languages, which confirms the results from the standard unsupervised setup, comparing lines 2 to 3.\nThese results indicate that little information can be learned about semantic roles from this parallel data setup. One possible explanation for this result is that the setup itself is inadequate. Given the definition of aligned arguments, only 8% of English arguments and 17% of German arguments are aligned. This plus our experiments suggest that improving the alignment model is a necessary step to making effective use of parallel data in multilingual SRI, for example by joint modeling with SRI. We leave this exploration to future work."

We investigate whether this setting improves the parameter estimates for the target language. To this end, we clamp the role annotations of the source language in the CoNLL dataset using a predefined mapping1, and do not sample them during training. This data gives us good parameters for the source language, which are used to sample the roles of the source language in the unlabeled Europarl data. The CLVs aim to capture this improvement and thereby improve sampling and parameter estimates for the target language. Table 2 shows the results of this experiment.

We make the following observations:\n• In both languages, at around S = 10, the supervised baseline starts outperforming the semisupervised model, which suggests that manually labeling about 10% of the sentences is a good enough alternative to our training procedure. Note that 10% amounts to about 3.6k sentences in German and 4k in English. We noticed that the proportion of seen predicates increases dramatically as we increase the proportion of supervised sentences. At 10% supervised sentences, the model has already seen 63% of predicates in German and 44% in English. This explains to some extent why only 10% labeled sentences are enough.\n• For German, it takes about 3.5% or 1260 supervised sentences to have the same performance increase as 1.5M unlabeled sentences (Line 1 to Line 2 in Table 1). Adding about 180 more supervised sentences also covers the benefit obtained by alignments in the multilingual model (Line 2 to Line 3 in Table 1). There is no noticeable performance difference in English.\nWe also evaluated the performance variation on a completely unseen CoNLL test set. Since the test set is very small compared to the training set, the clustering evaluation is not as reliable. Nonetheless, we broadly obtained the same pattern."

Fürstenau and Lapata (2009) used a graph alignment method to measure the semantic and syntactic similarity between dependency tree arguments of known and unknown verbs.\nFor monolingual unsupervised SRL, Swier and Stevenson (2004) presented the first work on a domain-general corpus, the British National Corpus, using 54 verbs taken from VerbNet. Garg and Henderson (2012) proposed a Bayesian model for this problem that we use here. Titov and\nKlementiev (2012a) also proposed a closely related Bayesian model. Grenager and Manning (2006) proposed a generative model but their parameter space consisted of all possible linkings of syntactic constituents and semantic roles, which made unsupervised learning difficult and a separate language-specific rule based method had to be used to constrain this space. Other proposed models include an iterative split-merge algorithm (Lang and Lapata, 2011a) and a graphpartitioning based approach (Lang and Lapata, 2011b). Màrquez et al.

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "We propose a Bayesian model of semantic role induction (SRI) that uses crosslingual latent variables to capture role alignments in parallel corpora. The crosslingual latent variables capture correlations between roles in different languages, and regularize the parameter estimates of the monolingual models. Because this is a joint Bayesian model of multilingual SRI, we can apply the same model to a variety of training scenarios just by changing the inference procedure appropriately. We evaluate monolingual SRI with a large unlabeled dataset, bilingual SRI with a parallel corpus, bilingual SRI with annotations available for the source language, and monolingual SRI with a small labeled dataset. Increasing the amount of monolingual unlabeled data significantly improves SRI in German but not in English. Adding word alignments in parallel sentences results in small, non significant improvements, even if there is some labeled data available in the source language. This difficulty in showing the usefulness of parallel corpora for SRI may be due to the current assumptions about role alignments, which mean that only a small percentage of roles are aligned. Further analyses reveals that annotating small amounts of data can easily outperform the performance gains obtained by adding large unlabeled dataset as well as adding parallel corpora.\nFuture work includes training on different language pairs, on more than two languages, and with more inclusive models of role alignment."

Our joint Bayesian model consists of individual models for each language plus additional latent variables that capture alignments between roles across languages. Because it is a generative Bayesian model, we can do evaluations in a variety of scenarios just by varying the inference procedure, without changing the model, thereby comparing the scenarios directly. We compare using only monolingual data, using a parallel corpus, using a parallel corpus with annotations in the other language, and using small amounts of annotation in the target language. We find that the biggest impact of adding a parallel corpus to training is actually the increase in mono-lingual data, with the alignments to another language resulting in small improvements, even with labeled data for the other language.",
