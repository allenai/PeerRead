      "text" : "Online Article Ranking as a Constrained, Dynamic, Multi-Objective Optimization Problem\nJeya Balaji Balasubramanian Intelligent Systems Program,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh jeya@pitt.edu\nAkshay Soni Yahoo! Research, Sunnyvale akshaysoni@yahoo-inc.com\nYashar Mehdad Airbnb, San Francisco\nyashar.mehdad@airbnb.com\nNikolay Laptev University of California, Los Angeles\nnlaptev@ucla.edu Abstract\nThe content ranking problem in a social news website, is typically a function that maximizes a scalar metric of interest like dwell-time. However, like in most real-world applications we are interested in more than one metric—for instance simultaneously maximizing click-through rate, monetization metrics, dwell-time— and also satisfy the traffic requirements promised to different publishers. All this needs to be done on online data and under the settings where the objective function and the constraints can dynamically change; this could happen if for instance new publishers are added, some contracts are adjusted, or if some contracts are over. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a constrained, dynamic, multi-objective optimization problem. We propose a novel framework that extends a successful genetic optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, to solve this online, data-driven problem. We design the modules of NSGA-II to suit our problem. We evaluate optimization performance using Hypervolume and introduce a confidence interval metric for assessing the practicality of a solution. We demonstrate the application of this framework on a real-world Article Ranking problem. We observe that we make considerable improvements in both time and performance over a bruteforce baseline technique that is currently in production."

      "text" : "Ranking a list of content based on a query (e.g., search results, or news articles where the query is the user) has been studied in depth. An example of this is article ranking in a news website that is typically aimed at maximizing a single scalar objective like dwell-time or click-through-rate (CTR). These are known as single-objective optimization (SOO) problems. However, most real-world content ranking platforms tries to optimize multiple objectives like dwell-time, CTR, daily active users (DAU), and monetization metrics simultaneously. Note that some of these objectives may be conflicting in the sense that if one of them increases, others may be forced to decrease; for instance, generally if one tries to increase the dwell-time, then CTR drops. This generates the need for formulating this as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem.\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nTo make it further complicated, the article ranking problems are generally subject to constraints such as traffic shaping requirements—these are partnership contracts between content aggregators and third party content providers to acquire content in return for a target traffic or revenue promises. The traffic, or revenue commitment, is documented in a contract and then manually tracked and reported by the partnership lead. This is usually done by pulling the data from various tools and sending a spreadsheet to the partners. This is a highly laborious process that is not scalable while also not providing the level of information granularity needed. One major challenge of many content aggregators is the control over achieving these targets; the current model is based on after-the-fact reporting rather than controlled targeting. The gap between the commitment and actual target achievement is often large and can range from 10% to 50% under achievement.\nFinally, the objectives of interest are generally dynamic in nature i.e., they may change with time. For example, CTR is known to show significant temporal variations with timeof-day, day-of-week effect, and CTR decay due to repeated exposure to the same articles (Agarwal, Chen, and Elango 2009). This requires us to optimize target traffic with respect to the dynamic behavior of these objectives."

      "text" : "An objective variable, y, is any random variable of interest that we want to optimize. An objective space, Y , is a vector of all objective variables that we want to simultaneously optimize. We represent the objective space as an m-dimensional vector, ~y = (y1, y2, . . . , ym) with m different objectives. For example in the news ranking problem, we may want to simultaneously optimize on total clicks, and dwell-time. A design variable, x, is any other random variable that can affect the value of the objective variables. This is usually a variable we can easily measure and control. The design space, X , is a vector of all design variables that can affect our objectives. We represent the design space as an n-dimensional vector, ~x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), with n candidate design variables. Examples of design variables in ranking can include the amount of user interest (views, likes, comments), page presentation, publisher reputation, etc. An objective function is a mapping function from the design space to the objective space, f : X → Y . A ar X iv :1\n70 5.\n05 76\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 6\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nmulti-objective function can be represented as a vector of m scalar objective functions, one for each objective variable, F (~x) = (f1(~x), f2(~x), . . . , fm(~x)).\nWe formulate the generic MOO problem as the following minimization problem,\nmin ~x∈S F (~x) = [f1(~x), f2(~x), . . . , fm(~x)] (1)\nwhere, S = {~x ∈ Rn : h(~x) = 0, g(~x) ≥ 0} The objective space can be subject to a set of constraints specified by the set S. The constraints can be represented in terms of equality constraints, h(·), and/or inequality constraints, g(·). For example, in traffic shaping, these constraints can be a requirement for total clicks to be greater than some target value for a partner, θclicks. This constraint can be re-written as: fClicks(~x)− θClicks ≥ 0 or g(~x) ≥ 0, where g(~x) = fClicks(~x)− θClicks.\nThe image of the feasible set under F (~x) for all possible values of ~x under constraints S is called the attained set. This is represented as C = {~y ∈ Rm : ~y = F (~x), ~x ∈ S}. Typically, a single-objective optimization returns a single globally optimal solution. In contrast, a solution to a MOO problem is a set of solutions, where each solution is said to be Pareto optimal.\nDefinition 1. Pareto optimal: A solution ~x∗ ∈ X to a minimization problem is said to be Pareto optimal iff there does not exist another solution ~x ∈ X , such that, F (~x) ≤ F (~x∗), and fi(~x) < fi(~x∗) for at least one of the objectives. (Marler and Arora 2004)\nA Pareto set (or Pareto front) is a set of all Pareto optimal solutions. This set is composed of extreme solutions (design variable assignments) which is optimal for one of the m objectives, while it is sub-optimal on others. All other solutions represent a range of trade-offs between the different objectives. In practice, it is not feasible to compute all solutions in the attained set C, therefore we require approximate solutions with some theoretical guarantees.\nThere are two important properties, or theoretical guarantees, of a good solution set that we are interested in 1) Convergence: each solution should be as close to the global optimum as possible; and 2) Diversity: the solution set should be uniformly spread over the Pareto front. Convergence ensures optimal solutions, and diversity ensures that we cover a wide variety of trade-offs between the multiple objectives.\nLet variable t represent time. The generalized dynamic MOO can be formulated using Equation (1) with a time parameter\nmin ~x∈St F (~x, t) = [f1(~x, t), f2(~x, t), . . . , fm(~x, t)] (2)\nwhere, St = {~x ∈ Rn : h(~x, t) = 0, g(~x, t) ≥ 0} Our contributions in this work include the development of a novel framework to perform constrained, MOO and extend it to optimize on dynamic objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-world application of MOO in an online data-driven problem. We propose modules in our framework more suited to the online problem. This presented us with new challenges including practicality of the solutions. We address those concerns with a new metric called Confidence Uncertainty."

      "text" : "In this section we describe a simple Article Score as a linear additive function of user activities on each article (design variables). Higher user activities tends to correspond to better user-engagement. For each news article, i, we compute the article score as\nScorei = α·Freshness+β · Views+γ ·Likes+φ·Comments (3) where Freshness indicates how recent the article is; newer articles tend to be more interesting on a social news website, number of V iews, number of Likes, and number of Comments are user activity signals on the news article. α, β, γ, and φ are the corresponding parameters of this scoring model. These parameters (or weights) are currently estimated using an optimization procedure called Grid Search. Once the values of the parameters are assigned, each article evaluates to an article score. This score is sorted to obtain a ranked list of articles.\nThe Grid Search uses a brute force search approach to uniformly sample the values of the parameters by finding the values of α, β, γ, and φ that maximizes a particular scalar metric, like dwell-time. The data for this optimization task is generated on a small fraction of randomly chosen users, called the exploration bucket. User activities on articles and the user engagement metrics, like dwell-time, are recorded for each article for different choices of the four parameters we are trying to learn. The design assignment that generates the highest dwell-time is considered to be optimal and is assigned to generate the scores used for the general (out of exploration bucket) user. The model is periodically updated to adapt to the changing dynamics in user behavior and traffic obligations. The reader can generalize this application to any optimization task which involves parameter (design variables) tuning of a function that evaluates to one or more metric (objectives) in an online optimization task.\nWhile the current approach is simple and works reasonably well in practice, it involves searching over the entire space of parameters in a brute-force manner. The exploration bucket users are subjected to low-quality experience while we try to optimize these parameters. Searching over the entire space of possible parameters takes time and generally hits on user experience as well. We formulate this parameter searching problem as an optimization problem, and do a more principled and adaptive search of the parameter space. Based on the parts of the parameter space we have explored so far, our approach makes a decision on where to explore next and which areas need not be explored any further."

      "text" : "We first define the concept of non-dominance that is closely related to the concept of Pareto optimality.\nDefinition 2. Non-Dominated and Dominated points: A vector of objective functions, F (~x∗) ∈ C, is non-dominated iff there does not exist another vector, F (~x) ∈ C, such that, F (~x) ≤ F (~x∗) with fi(~x) < fi(~x∗) for at least one of the objectives. Otherwise, F (~x∗) is said to be dominated. (Marler and Arora 2004)\nThe subtle difference between the concept of Pareto optimality (Definition 1) and non-dominance (Definition 2) is that Pareto optimality is defined in terms of the design space, while non-dominance is defined in terms of the objective space. For all practical purposes, this distinction is not important to us.\n(Deb et al. 2002) propose a fast and efficient algorithm for non-dominated sorting (NDS) to sort solutions in the objective space and identify the set of non-dominated solutions. They use this NDS algorithm in their multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, NSGA-II, to identify the Pareto set in the solutions available in each generation. The computational complexity of this sorting approach is O(mK2), where m is the number of objectives, and K is size of the input to the NDS algorithm. In NSGA-II, this size is fixed to be equal to the user input parameter, population size.\nGrid Search (Baseline model) Grid Search is the current single-metric optimization technique used for our application. It is a simple brute force search over all possible values of the design variables. For each assignment of the design variables, it’s objective evaluation is computed using the objective function. This objective function is a machine learning model, usually Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) learned from the training data.\nWe extend this algorithm to handle multiple objectives. We do so by using the non-domination heuristic. We use NDS to identify the Pareto set from a set of different design variable assignments. We also extend the current approach to handle constraints by simply checking if each evaluation meets the constraints, before we sort it using NDS.\nAlgorithm 1: Grid Search (Baseline) Input: Training data (D), Design constraints (S),\nObjective functions (F ), Increment percentage (inc)\nOutput: Approximated Pareto set, Q 1 Initialize an empty list, final← ∅. 2 Initialize a design vector p with dimension n assigning\nthe minimum value for each design variable seen in the training data D.\n3 Let Π be a list of all possible permutations of values of p, where each variable takes discrete value increments, inc% inclusively between the minimum and maximum value of the design variable seen in D. 4 foreach π ∈ Π do 5 if F (π) satisfies constraint S then 6 Add π to final 7 end 8 end 9 Q← Pareto-set in Non-Dominated-Sort(final)\n10 return Q\nAlgorithm 1 describes our extension of the existing simple brute force algorithm, the Grid Search, to handle multiple objectives with constraints. The feasible solutions are sorted using NDS. The algorithm takes as input the training data,D (from exploration bucket), Design constraints, S (eg., traffic shaping requirements), Objective functions, F (eg., GBDT model to predict Dwell time from an assignment of design variables.), and an increment, inc to define the granularity of the different values explored for each design variables.\nThe time complexity of NDS is O(mK2) for m objectives and K solutions. In the worst case, Grid Search returns vd solutions, where v is the number of different values generated from a granularity of inc. The overall complexity is O(mvd). It can be clearly seen that it scales very poorly with the number of design variables, d.\nDO-NSGA-II In GA terminology, a collection of candidate solutions, ~x, is called a population. Typically, GAs initialize with random solutions as the initial population. GAs then use two operators to generate new solutions from existing ones: crossover and mutation. An iteration of generating new solutions from existing ones, using crossover and mutation operators, is called a generation. In the crossover operator two (or more) solutions, called parents, are selected from the current population, their solutions are combined together to produce new solutions, called children. Crossover ensures that elements of good solutions make it to the next generation promoting convergence. The mutation operator introduces random changes to a solution. The mutation operator creates diversity in the solution set and also helps escape local optima. The crossover and mutation operator is sometimes preceded by the selection operator that identifies parents from the population, which are promising candidates to approach convergence towards global optima, and passes them to the crossover and mutation operator. Each of the three operators: selection, crossover, and mutation, can be considered as separate modules in the GA.\nWe extend NSGA-II (Deb et al. 2002) (Non-dominated Sorting genetic Algorithm) from which we used the NDS algorithm to sort candidate solutions and identify the Pareto set in Grid Search. Other than the fast and efficient sorting algorithm NSGA-II is a popular choice in MOO literature. Another advantage of NSGA-II is that there exists a dynamic version to handle a dynamic objective function (Deb, Karthik, and others 2007) which we can build on for our application. The authors test their approach with a numerical function and not in a data-driven online setting. We extend the NSGA-II framework to handle dynamic online data. We call this extension- Dynamic, Online NSGA-II or DO-NSGA-II.\nFitness function: The fitness function of a GA is the heuristic used by the algorithm to evaluate the merit of a solution. DO-NSGA-II uses Pareto-dominance ranking as the fitness function. We define this heuristic in Definition 2. A set of solutions in a population, set A, in the GA is ranked better (lower) than another set of solutions, set B, if each individual solution in set A are non-dominated by each individual solution in set B.\nDiversity: An important advantage of using GA is the\nability to control diversity of the population. DO-NSGA-II uses crowding distance to prefer diverse solutions. A front is a set of solutions in a population with the same Paretodominance rank. For each solution within a front, for each objective, i, the solutions within a front are first sorted with respect to that objective. The first and last solutions in the sorted list are given a distance score of infinity (to protect extreme solutions). For all the solutions in between, the score is computed by taking the normalized difference between the objective values of the solutions, before and after the current solution in the sorted list, Distance(~xi)← fj(~xi+1)−fj(~xi−1)fmaxj −fminj . For a detailed review of different fitness functions and diversity metrics used in GA literature, refer to (Konak, Coit, and Smith 2006).\nSelection operator: We use constraint dominance binary selection (Deb et al. 2002) as our selection operator. This module handles the constraints in DO-NSGA-II and promotes diversity. It first randomly chooses two solutions from the current population. If one of the two is feasible, the feasible solution is selected to the next generation. If both are unfeasible, the solution with the smaller constraint violation is selected. If both solutions are feasible, the solution with the better Pareto rank is selected. If they belong to the same front, then the solution with the larger crowding distance is selected. The choice of this algorithm is particularly attractive to our problem where the algorithm adapts to dynamic changes in the constraints (changing traffic shaping targets).\nCrossover operator: We use Simulated Binary Crossover (SBX) (Deb and Beyer 2001) algorithm that is widely used in literature. We introduce two parameters to DO-NSGA-II that SBX depends upon: probability of crossover, Pc, and the spread factor of the polynomial distribution ηc. Smaller values of ηc return children that are very different from the parents, while larger values return children similar to the parents.\nMutation operator: We use Highly-Disruptive Polynomial Mutation (Hamdan 2012b) algorithm, shown to be effective at escaping the local optima on standard synthetic problems. In principle it is similar to SBX, and introduces similar parameters. the probability of mutation, Pm, and the spread factor for a polynomial distribution ηm.\nThe purpose of the mutation operator in our application is to handle dynamics in the objective. Ideally we do not want a big loss in performance to a dynamic change of objective. We motivate our implementation using Hypermutation (Cobb 1990). Here, we increase Pm when a change is detected. We detect a change in DO-NSGA-II by re-evaluating all the existing solutions, if the objective value has changed from the previous generation, Pm increases.\nThe time-complexity of DO-NSGA-II remains O(mK2) for m objectives and K solutions."

Hypervolume (Hv.) metric is the hypervolume (scalar value) occupied by some reference point and the approximated Pareto set treated as a minimization problem. This metric is commonly accepted since a large value indicates both better convergence and better diversity. For a solution set with k solutions and m objectives, we compute the hypervolume using an O(km−2 log k) time and linear space complexity implementation as described in (Fonseca, Paquete, and López-Ibánez 2006). We perform min-max scaling of the objective space before computing the hypervolume to avoid bias in the metric from different scales of the dimensions of the objective space. Due to the min-max scaling, the worst result in the minimization prob-\nlem cannot be greater than (1.0, 1.0). So, we use a reference point value of [2.0, 2.0].\nWe introduce a new metric called the Confidence Uncertainty (CU), which is the volume (scalar value) occupied by the 90% confidence intervals of each of the m objectives. We estimate the 90% confidence interval of each solution, across each objective, using quantile regression. We return CU as the product, of m objectives, from the min-max normalized difference between the upper and lower bounds of the 90% confidence interval."

There are 4 design variables: article freshness, total user views, likes, and comments. The 2 objective variables of our interest are the total article clicks, and dwell-time (in milliseconds).\nDynamic data The dynamics of our objectives are a function of time. The number of clicks or dwell time, any article receives depends upon the time of day. For example, it correlates to the work routine of a large subset of the users. Data was collected at 4 different time intervals of the day: 1) Time step 1, [00:00, 6:00] hours (50588 instances), 2) Time step 2, [06:00, 12:00] hours (51284 instances), 3) Time step 3, [12:00, 18:00] hours (72019 instances), and 4) Time step 4, [18:00, 00:00] hours (72705 instances).

    "abstractText" : "The content ranking problem in a social news website, is typically a function that maximizes a scalar metric of interest like dwell-time. However, like in most real-world applications we are interested in more than one metric—for instance simultaneously maximizing click-through rate, monetization metrics, dwell-time— and also satisfy the traffic requirements promised to different publishers. All this needs to be done on online data and under the settings where the objective function and the constraints can dynamically change; this could happen if for instance new publishers are added, some contracts are adjusted, or if some contracts are over. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a constrained, dynamic, multi-objective optimization problem. We propose a novel framework that extends a successful genetic optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, to solve this online, data-driven problem. We design the modules of NSGA-II to suit our problem. We evaluate optimization performance using Hypervolume and introduce a confidence interval metric for assessing the practicality of a solution. We demonstrate the application of this framework on a real-world Article Ranking problem. We observe that we make considerable improvements in both time and performance over a bruteforce baseline technique that is currently in production.",
