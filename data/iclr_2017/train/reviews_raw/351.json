{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Diet Networks: Thin Parameters for Fat Genomics", "abstract": "Learning tasks such as those involving genomic data often poses a serious challenge: the number of input features can be orders of magnitude larger than the number of training examples, making it difficult to avoid overfitting, even when using the known regularization techniques. We focus here on tasks in which the input is a description of the genetic variation specific to a patient, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), yielding millions of ternary inputs. Improving the ability of deep learning to handle such datasets could have an important impact in medical research, more specifically in precision medicine, where high-dimensional data regarding a particular patient is used to make predictions of interest. Even though the amount of data for such tasks is increasing, this mismatch between the number of examples and the number of inputs remains a concern. Naive implementations of classifier neural networks involve a huge number of free parameters in their first layer (number of input features times number of hidden units): each input feature is associated with as many parameters as there are hidden units. We propose a novel neural network parametrization which considerably reduces the number of free parameters. It is based on the idea that we can first learn or provide a distributed representation for each input feature (e.g. for each position in the genome where variations are observed in data), and then learn (with another neural network called the parameter prediction network) how to map a feature's distributed representation (based on the feature's identity not its value) to the vector of parameters specific to that feature in the classifier neural network (the weights which link the value of the feature to each of the hidden units). This approach views the problem of producing the parameters associated with each feature as a multi-task learning problem. We show experimentally on a population stratification task of interest to medical studies that the proposed approach can significantly reduce both the number of parameters and the error rate of the classifier.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The problem addressed here is practically important (supervised learning with n<", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "The reviewers agreed that the paper proposed a solid and original contribution that was evaluated well.

The approach looks very interesting but the\nexperiments are too limited to draw firm conclusions about the\nstrengths of different approaches. The presentation would benefit from\nmore precise math.\n\n\nQuality:\n\nThe basic idea of the paper is interesting and the applied deep\nlearning methodology appears reasonable. The experimental evaluation\nis rather weak as it only covers a single data set and a very limited\nnumber of cross validation folds. Given the significant variation in\nthe performances of all the methods, it seems the differences between\nthe better-performing methods are probably not statistically\nsignificant. More comprehensive empirical validation could clearly\nstrengthen the paper.\n\n\nClarity:\n\nThe writing is generally good both in terms of the biology and ML, but\nmore mathematical rigour would make it easier to understand precisely\nwhat was done. The different architectures are explained on an\nintuitive level and might benefit from a clear mathematical\ndefinition. I was ultimately left unsure of what the \"raw end2end\"\nmodel is - given so few parameters it cannot work on raw 300k\ndimensional input but I could not figure out what kind of embedding\nwas used.\n\nThe results in Fig. 3 might be clearer if scaled so that maximum for\neach class is 1 to avoid confounding from different numbers of\nsubjects in different classes.

It is too early to tell whether the specific techniques proposed\nin the paper will be the ultimate solution, but at the very least the\npaper provides interesting new ideas for others to work on.\n\n\nOther comments:\n\nI think releasing the code as promised would be a must.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "No Title", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper addresses the important problem (d>>n) in deep learning. \nThe proposed approach, based on lower-dimensional feature embeddings, is reasonable and makes applying deep learning methods to data with large d possible.\nThe paper is well written and the results show improvements over reasonable baselines.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"TITLE": "Few questions", "OTHER_KEYS": "G\u00f6kcen Eraslan", "comments": "Thanks for this very nice paper.
