Thus, Lit-simplifying (or Var(simplifying) a KBduring a preliminary o -line phase an prove helpful for improving on-line inferen esin e simpli ation never in reases the size of a KB. As shown by Proposition 23, asimilar on lusion annot be drawn to what on erns forgetting. This seems to be thepri e to be paid to bene t from the power of forgetting. However, this negative on lu-sion must be tempered by the two following omments. On the one hand, forgetting isinteresting per se; it is not only a tool that an help improving inferen e in some asesbut also a goal in several AI appli ations. On the other hand, our omplexity resultsrelate to the worst ase situation, only, and, as evoked before, forgetting is feasible inmany pra ti al ases. Finally, let us note that there are several omplete propositionalfragments for whi h forgetting is easy. Espe ially, as advo ated by Darwi he (1999), ompiling a KB into a DNNF formula during an o -line step an prove pra ti allyvaluable to a hieve forgetting in an eÆ ient way, provided that the size of the ompiledform remains small enough (whi h annot be guaranteed in the worst ase). Sin e itis not known whether the DNNF fragment is stri tly more su in t than the primeimpli ates one (Darwi he & Marquis, 1999), the prime impli ates fragment an also betargeted with pro t as a ompilation language for some knowledge bases; espe ially,some re ent approa hes to the impli it representation of prime impli ates (Simon &del Val, 2001) exhibit very signi ant empiri al performan es (they enable the om-putation of sets of prime impli ates ontaining up to 1070 lauses). A ordingly, they an prove valuable for the pra ti al omputing of independen e and forgetting.A knowledgementsThe third author has been partly supported by the IUT de Lens, the Universit e d'Artois,the R egion Nord / Pas-de-Calais under the TACT-TIC proje t, and by the European Com-munity FEDER Program.
