      "text" : "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have always been setting new state of the art performance in various fields including computer vision, speech recognition as well as natural language processing. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, have outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms on computer vision tasks such as image recognition, object detection, semantic segmentation as well as gesture and action recognition. These breakthroughs are partially due to the added computational complexity and the storage footprint, which makes these models very hard to train as well as to deploy. For example, the Alexnet [10] involves 61M float-point parameters and 729M high precision multiply-accumulate operations\n(MACs). Current DNNs are usually trained offline by utilizing specialized hardwares like NVIDIA GPUs and CPU clusters. But such an amount of computation may be unaffordable for portable devices such as mobile phones, tablets and wearable devices, which usually have limited computing resources. What’s more, the huge storage requirement and large memory accesses may hinder efficient haredware implementation of neural networks, like FPGAs and neural network oriented chips.\nThere have been many studies working on reducing the storage and the computational complexity of DNNs by quantizing the parameters of these models. Some of these works quantize the pretrained weights using several bits (usually 3∼12 bits) with a minimal loss of performance. However, in these kind of quantized networks one still needs to employ large numbers of multiply-accumulate operations. Others focuse on training these networks from scratch with binary (+1 and -1) or ternary (+1, 0 and -1) weights. These methods do not rely on pretrained models and may reduce the computations at both training stage as well as testing stage. But on the other hand, these methods could not make use of the pretrained models very efficiently due to the dramatic information loss during the binary or ternary quantization of these weights. Moreover, all these methods are highly constrained by the direct quantization scheme, for example, these methods must have exactely the same number of quantized weights as the full precision weights in each layer of the original networks. However, the redundances of deep neural networks differ from layer to layer, thus it is inefficient to use fixed numbers of weights for the quantized networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a unified framework based on fixed point factorization and full precision recovery of\nweight matrices to simultaneously accelerate and compress DNN models with only minor performance degradation. It is nontrivial to utilize fixed point factorization of weight matrices. One may argue to use full precision matrix decomposition like SVD, followed by fixed point quantization of the decomposed submatrices. However, this kind of method has two obvious shortcomings. Firstly, the matrix approximation is optimized for the full precision submatrices, but not for the fixed point representation, which is our real purpose. Moreover, the weight distributions after decomposition are quite complicate, which makes fixed point quantization more difficult. On the contrary, in this paper we propose to firstly factorize the weight matrix using fixedpoint (+1, 0 and -1) representation followed by recoverying the (pseudo) full precision submatrices. We also propose a effective and practical technique called weight balancing, which makes our fine-tuning much more stable. We demonstrate the effects of the fixed point factorization, full precision weights recovery, weight balancing and whole-model performance on ImageNet classification. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n• We propose the FFN framework for DNN acceleration and compression, which is more flexible and accurate and to our knowledge, is the first fixed point decomposition based quantization method in this area.\n• Based on fixed point factorization, we propose a novel full precision weight recovery method, which makes it possible to make full use of the pretrained models even for very deep architectures.\n• We investigate the weight imbalancing problem generally existing in matrix/tensor decomposition based DNN acceleration methods. Inspired by weights initialization methods, we present an effective weight balancing technique to stabilize the finetuning stage of DNN models."

      "text" : "CNN acceleration and compression is widely studied in recent years. We mainly list works that are closely related with ours, i.e., the low-rank based methods and fixed-point quantization based methods.\nDeep neural networks are usually over-parameterized and the redundancy can be removed as shown in the work of [3], which achieves 1.6× speed-up for a single layer using biclustering and low-rank approximation of filter matrix. Since then, many low-rank based methods are proposed. Jaderberg [8] propose to use filter low-rank approximation and data reconstruction to lower the approximation error and achieve 2.5× speed-up for scene text character recognition with no loss in accuracy. Zhang et al. [19] propose a novel nonlinear data reconstruction method, which\nallows asymmetric reconstruction to prevent error accumulation across layers. They achieves 3.8× speed-up on VGG16 model with only a 0.3% increase of top-5 error in ImageNet [15] classification. Many work also explore the lowrank tensor decomposition method for neural network acceleration and compression. Lebedev et al. [11] propose to use CP-decomposition on 4D convolutional kernels using multiple rank-one tensors, which achieves 8.5× speedup for character-classification CNN. Kim et al. [9] propose to use Tucker decomposition to speed up the execution of CNN models. They show great speed-up and energy reduction on smartphone which is equipped with a mobile GPU. Wang et al. [17] propose to accelerate the test-phase computation of CNNs based on low-rank and group sparse tensor decomposition. They achieve 6.6× speed-up on VGG-16 model within 1% increased top-5 error.\nFixed-point quantization based method are also investigated by several recent works. Soudry et al. develop the Expectation Backpropagation (EBP) [1] method, which is a variational Bayes method to binarize both weights and neurons and achieves good results for fully connected networks on MNIST dataset. In the work of BinaryConnect (BC) [2], the authors propose to use binary weights for forward and backward computation while keep a full-precision version of weights for gradients accumulation. Great results have been achieved on small datasets like MNIST, CIFA-10 and SVHN. Binary-Weight-Network (BWN) [11] is proposed in a more recent work, which is among the first ones to evaluate the performance of binarization on large-scale datasets like ImageNet [15] and yields good results. These methods train neural networks from scratch and can barely benefit from pretrained networks. Hwang et al. [6] find a way by first quantize pretrained weights using a small number of weights, followed by retraining. However, their method relies on carefully choosing the step size of quantization using exhaustive search. And the scalability on large-scale datasets remains unclear.\nBesides these methods mentioned above, there have been other approaches on DNN acceleration. Han et al. [5] use network pruning to remove low-saliency parametera and small-weight connections to dramatically reduce parameter size. Wu et al. [18] propose to use product quantization for CNN compression and acceleration at the same time. FFT-based methods [12] are also investigated. Many works [14] utilize a smaller network but achieve comparable performance, which is another widely studied stream for DNN acceleration."

Unlike many previous low-rank based matrix decomposition methods which use float point values for the factor-\nized submatrixes, our method aims at fixed-point factorization directly.\nTo more efficiently make use of the pre-trained weights, we also introduce our novel psudo full-precision weight matrix recovery method in addition to the fix-point approximation. Thus the information of the pre-trained models is divided into two parts: the first one is the fixed-point factorized submatrices and the second one resides in the psudo full-precision weight matrices, which on the other hand, will transfor to the fixed-point weight matrices in the finetuning stage.\nMoreover, our weights balancing technique makes the fine-tuning more efficient and has an important role in our whole framework. We will discuss these three parts of our proposed framework thoughly in the following subsections."

      "text" : "A general deep neural network usually has multiple fully connected layers and / or convolutional layers. For the fully connected layers, the output signal vector so is computed as:\nso = φ(Wsi + b) (1)\nwhere si is the input signal vector and W and b are the weight matrix and the bias term respectively. For a convolutional layer with n filters of size w × h × c where w, h and c are the kernel width and height and the number of input feature maps, if we reshape the kernel and the input volume at every spatial positions, the feedforward pass of the convolution can also be expressed by equation 1. Thus our decomposition is conducted on the weight matrix W .\nThere is a trivial solution to the fixed-point quantization combined with matrix decomposition, i.e., to firstly conduct full precision matrix decomposition like SVD, followed by fixed point quantization of the decomposed submatrices. However, this kind of method has two obvious shortcomings. Firstly, the matrix approximation is optimized for the full precision submatrices, but not for the fixed point representation, which is our real purpose. Moreover, the weight distributions after decomposition are quite complicate, which makes fixed point quantization more difficult.\nOn the contrary, in this subsection we propose to directly factorize the weight matrices into fixed-point format. More specifically, we want to approximate our weight matrix W ∈ Rm×n as a weighted sum of outer products of several (k) vector pairs with only ternary (+1, 0 and -1) entries, which is refered to as the semidiscrete decomposition (SDD) in the following format:\nW ≈\nk ∑\ni\ndixiyi = XDY T (2)\nwhere X ∈ {+1, 0,−1}m×k and Y ∈ {+1, 0,−1}n×k and D ∈ Rk×k is a diagonal matrix. Because of the ternary\nconstraints, the computation of SDD is a NP-hard problem. Kolda and O’Leary propose to obtain an approximate local solution by greedily finding the best next dixiyi. To further reduce the approximation error of the decomposition, we develop an improved version of wheir algorithm as in Algorithm 1 by iteratively minimizing the residual error.\nAlgorithm 1: Improved SDD decomposition.\nInput: Matrix W ∈ Rm×n, non-negative integer k; Output: X ∈ {+1, 0,−1}m×k, Y ∈ {+1, 0,−1}n×k, diagonal matrix D ∈ Rk×k+ Initialization:\ndi ← 0 for i = 1, · · · , k;\nSelect Y ∈ {−1, 0, 1}n×k\nwhile not converge do\nfor i = 1, · · · , k\n1.

Set di to the average of R ◦ xiyTi over the non-zero locations of xiyTi\n6. Set xi as the i-th column of X , yi the i-th column of Y and di the i-th diagonal value of D\nend for\nend while\nOnce the decomposition is done, we can replace the original weights W with the factorized ones, i.e., the X,Y and D. More formally, for convolutional layers, the original layer is replaced by three layers: the first one is a convolutional layer with k filters of size w × h × c, which are all with ternary values; The second layer is a ”channel-wise scaling layer”, i.e., each of the k feature maps is multiplied by a scaling factor; The last layer is another convolutional layer with n filters of size 1×1×k, which also have ternary values."

      "text" : "Our fixed-point factorization method is much more accurate than direct binarization or ternarization method and many other fixed-point quantization method. But there is still the need of finetuning to restore the precision of DNN\nmodels. Like most of current fixed-point quantization based accelerating method, we want to use the quantized weights (the X,Y in our case) during the forward and backward propagation while use the full-precision weights for gradient accumulation. However, after factorization, we have lost the full-precision weights, i.e., we can not use the original W for gradient accumulation any longer. A simple solution is to use the float-point version of X and Y as fullprecision weights to accumulate gradients. But this is far from satisfactory.\nIn this subsection, we present our novel full-precision weights recovery method to make the fine-tuning stage much easier. Our motivation is very simple, we want to recovery the full-precision version of X and Y , indicated by X̂ and Ŷ , which can better approximateW , at the constraint that, after fixed-point quantization, X̂ and Ŷ turn to X and Y respectively. We can treat our full-precision weights recovery method as an inversion of current fixed-point quantization methods. In fixed-point quantization based DNN acceleration and compression methods, we quantize each element of the full-precision weight matrices into the nearest fixed-point format value. While in our method, we have got the fixed-point version of the weights, and we want to determine from which value the fixed-point element is quantized. We turn this problem into an optimization problem as follows:\nminimize X̂,Ŷ\n‖ W − X̂DŶ ‖ 2\nF\nsubject to |X̂ −X | < 0.5\n|Ŷ − Y | < 0.5\n(3)\nHere the two constraints are introduced to ensure that the X̂ and Ŷ are quantized to X and Y . The problem can be efficiently solved by alternating method. Note we constraint X̂ and Ŷ to be always between -1.5 and 1.5 to alleviate overfitting and during fine-tuning, we also clip the weights as well.\nDuring fine-tuning stage, we quantize the full-precision weights of X̂ and Ŷ according to the following equation:\nq(Aij) =\n\n\n +1 0.5 < Aij < 1.5 0 −0.5 ≤ Aij ≤ 0.5 −1 −1.5 < Aij < −0.5\n(4)\nThe quantized weights are used to conduct forward and backward computation and the full-precision weights X̂ and Ŷ are used to accumulate gradients during backpropagation. Both X an Y will change during fine-tuning because of the updates of X̂ and Ŷ , for example, some elements of X and Y will turn from 0 to 1 and so on. We use the recovered full-precision weights instead of the float-point versions of X and Y to accumulate gradients is based on the argument that, for example again, there is more chance for 0.499 to become 1 from 0 than for 0.001 to\nturn to 1 from 0. And these information reside in the fullprecision weight matrices and is transfored to the quantized weights during fine-tuning. Note that when the fine-tuning is done, we will discard the full-precision weighs and we only use the quantized weighs X and Y for prediction."

      "heading" : "3.3. Weight Balancing",
      "text" : "So far, we have presented our fixed-point decomposition and full-precision weights recovery method to improve the test-phase efficiency of deep neural networks. However, there is still a problem to be considered, which we refered to as weight imbalance.\nWeight imbalance is a common problem of decomposition based methods, not just existing in our framework. This problem is caused by the non-uniqueness of the decomposition. Suppose we have a weight matrix W , which is factorized into the product of two matrices P and Q, i.e., W = PQ. Now we consider the partial derivatives of W with respect to P and Q:\n{\n∂W ∂P\n= Q ∂W ∂Q = P (5)\nIf we let P ′ = 10 ∗ P and Q′ = 0.1 ∗ Q, now the decomposition becoms W = P ′Q′ and the partial derivatives becom:\n{\n∂W ∂P ′ = Q′ = 0.1 ∗Q = 0.1 ∗ ∂W ∂P ∂W ∂Q′ = P ′ = 10 ∗ P = 10 ∗ ∂W ∂Q\n(6)\nFrom equation 6 we can see that, P is enlarged 10 times while the gradient is reduced to one-tenth of the original. And what happend to Q is opposite to P . The consequence is that during back-propagation,Q changes frequently while P almost stays untouched. At this time, one has to use different learning rate for each layers. However, this is quite a hard job especially for very deep neural networks.\nIn our framework, the weight matrix W ∈ Rm×n is replaced by X̂DŶ T , where the X̂ ∈ Rm×k and Ŷ ∈ Rn×k is in the range of [-1.5, 1.5] while D is at the scale of about 0.00001 to 0.01. And for convolutional layers, X̂ usually has much more elements than Ŷ because of the w × h spatial size of filters in X̂ . To balance the weights into their appropriate scales, and inspired by the normalized weight initialization methhod proposed in [4], we develop the following weight balancing approaches:\nFirst, we want to find the scale factor λX and λY for X̂ and Ŷ , which are proportional to the square root of the number of their rows and colums.\nSecond, we try to make the balanced D close to identity matrix by setting the mean value of the elements along the diagonal to one. Because for fully-connected layer, D is a element-wise scaling factor and for convolutional layers, D is a channel-wise scaling factor. Thus making D close to one will not affect the calculation of gradients much.\nThis can be expressed by the equation 7 where X̃ , Ỹ and D̃ represent the balanced version of weight matrices.\n\n  \n   \nX̃ = λX ∗ X̂ = λ√ m+k ∗ X̂ Ỹ = λY ∗ Ŷ = λ√ n+k ∗ Ŷ D̃ = D λX∗λY mean(D̃) = 1\n(7)"

The resulting architecture has 60M parameters. At finetuning stage, images are resized to 256 × 256 pixel size as the same with original Alexnet.\nWe also compare our method with the following approaches, whose results on ImageNet dataset are available to us. The BWN method only report their results on AlexNet using batch normalization [7], so in order to compare with their results, we also report our results using batch normalization with the same settings as in BWN.\n• BWN: [11]: Binary-weight-network, using binary weights and float-point scaling factors;\n• BC: [2]: BinaryConnec, using binary weights, reproduced by [11];\n• LDR [13]: Logarithmic Data Representation, 4-bit logarithmic activation and 5-bit logarithmic weights.\nThe results are listed in Table 4.1.

However, DNN-based methods are both computational-intensive and resource-consuming, which hinders the application of these methods on embedded systems like smart phones. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel Fixed-point Factorized Networks (FFN) on pre-trained models to reduce the computational complexity as well as the storage requirement of networks. Extensive experiments on large-scale ImageNet classification task show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",
