      "text" : "Assume that we have n different individuals and m different relationships. Let Pi, \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC56 ∈ Π={1,…,n} , represent the individuals, and Rj, \uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC57 ∈ Λ={1,…,m} , represent the relationships. We can store the relationships between the individuals with a matrix T,\nin which a cell T1,2 is the relationship between P1 and P2 that is recorded in a database. In CBDB, an R1 can be basic, e.g., “F” which represents a “father-of” relationship, and an R2 can be extended, e.g., “DHB” which represents a “daughter’s husband’s brother”3 relationship while the participating individuals in between are unknown. In the matrix in Figure 1, we have T1,2=“F”, and that means P2 is a father of P1. That T2,3=“DHB” means P3 is P2’s daughter’s husband’s brother. A relationship matrix like that in Figure 1 does not have to be symmetric. In addition, a cell in the matrix may need to accommodate multiple values when necessary. When we convert the relationship matrix directly from a biographical database, the original matrix may be asymmetric, because the information stored in databases are not symmetric. If we wish, we can build a symmetric matrix from a raw matrix like that in Figure 1, by checking and combining Ti1,i2 and Ti2,i1 for any combination of \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC561 ∈ Π and \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC562 ∈ Π. In this process, we might find conflicting or even parallel relationships between two individuals, which will need domain experts for further inspection. A person may have parallel (or multiple) relationships with another due to many reasons.\n1 Chao-Lin Liu, Tun-Wen Pai, Chun-Tien Chang, and Chang-Ming Hsieh (2001) Path-planning algorithms for public\ntransportation systems, Proc. of the Fourth Int’l IEEE Conf. on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 1061‒1066. 2 China Biographical Database: https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/cbdb 3 Here, D stands for “daughter”, H for “husband”, and B for “brother”.\nT = 1 2 3 1 2 3 � F DHB�\nFig. 1.

The simplest choice is to convert cells that have known relationships into 1s and others into 0s. We convert the\nmatrix in Figure 1 into the M and compute its square in Figure 2. Note that the 1 in M2 is informative. It indicates that P3 is P1’s father’s daughter’s husband’s brother. The fact that the powers of an RM are informative is a natural result of the definition of multiplication of matrices. Let Mx,y2 denote the cell (x,y) of M\n2. We compute Mx,y2 based on the definition in (1). When we convert an RM into a binary RM, a cell is one only if the cell represents an existing relationship. Hence, definition (1) essentially states that Px and Py has relationships if there exists a person Pz such that (1) Pz is a relative of Px and (2) Py is a relative of Pz. Furthermore, the value of Mx,y2 is the total number of such two-step relationships.\nMx,y2 = ∑ Mx,z × Mz,yz∈Π (1) In addition to counting the indirect relationships when computing (1), we can concatenate the\nrelationships of Mx,z and Mz,y to obtain a two-step relationship for Px and Py. For instance, concatenating “F”, “2”, and “DHB” to obtain “1_F_2_DHB_3”, in the computation for the M2 in Figure 2, will record one indirect relationship between P1 and P3 and the intermediate participants. This operation of concatenation and recording can be achieved by software easily."

      "text" : "We can easily generalize the implication of (1) to consider the semantics of the values in the n-th power of a binary RM, M, to achieve the following theorem. Theorem 1. Let M denote a binary relationship matrix as we explained above. A person Px and a person Py are relatives if there is a \uD835\uDF0C\uD835\uDF0C ≥ 1 such that Mx,y\nρ >0. There are 360,000 individuals in the 2015 version of CBDB, and we should be able to identify\nclusters of individuals that represent families. Although Theorem 1 is applicable for this task, a more efficient method is to apply the ideas of identifying connected components in mathematical graphs. The basic idea is quite simple: individuals that have relationships belong to a family and members of different families cannot have any relationships. Corollary 1 allows us to find the shortest relationships between two individuals. If the kin relationships in the original RM are genuinely basic, e.g., father, month, son, daughter, husband, wife, brother, and sister, then we could find the most direct relationships between individuals with the corollary. Corollary 1. Let M denote the binary RM of an RM. By finding the smallest σ such that Mx,yσ is positive, we identify the relationship between Px and Py that has the fewest number of intermediate participants.\nM = 1 2 3\n1 2 3 � 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 � M 2= 1 2 3 1 2 3 � 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 �\nFig. 2. A binary relationship matrix and its square\nIn practice, not all kin relationships recorded in historical documents are basic, and extended relationships such as “DHB” may be recorded. As a consequence, a “shortest path” as defined in Corollary 1 may not be the most direct path between two individuals. We can define the “lengths” of relationships to quantify the distances between individuals.4 Take “DHB” as an example. That Py is a “DHB” of Px means that Py is one generation after Px, and we can define the g-len of “DHB” as -15. Analogously, the g-len of “F” is 1. The g-len of a path is the sum of the g-lens of all relationships in the path, so the g-len of “F_2_DHB” is 0. The length of a relationship can encode the “sideway” distances as well. We can define the s-lens of “DHB” and “F” to be 2 and 0, respectively. In practice, there are only few hundreds of relationships in CBDB, so it is feasible to annotate the relationships with their lengths."
